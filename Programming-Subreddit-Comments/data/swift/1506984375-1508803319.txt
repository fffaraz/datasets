Problem number 3 is why problem numbers 1 and 2 exist.
So the idea is to sub to the class through iOS to be able to watch it on MacOS?
You'll need to post some code that shows the issue, the code you posted works fine on Xcode 9 with Swift 4 let cookies = [ "cookies": ["chocolate chip", "oatmeal", "snickerdoodle"]] let json = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: cookies)
 $ xcrun swift Welcome to Apple Swift version 3.0.2 (swiftlang-800.0.63 clang-800.0.42.1). Type :help for assistance. 1&gt; import Foundation 2&gt; let cookies = [ "cookies": ["chocolate chip", "oatmeal", "snickerdoodle"]] cookies: [String : [String]] = 1 key/value pair { [0] = { key = "cookies" value = 3 values { [0] = "chocolate chip" [1] = "oatmeal" [2] = "snickerdoodle" } } } 3&gt; print(String(data: JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: cookies), encoding: .utf8)!) {"cookies":["chocolate chip","oatmeal","snickerdoodle"]} Looks fine to me. Can you provide an MCVE?
&gt;Swift is a building base of very insignificant number Apple products. I believe that is a mistake as developers have been turning to Swift in rather large numbers, mainly due to Objective C sucking so bad. &gt;Additionally, Apple is stumbling behind FB or Google when it comes to the ML because of their data policy Again it is one of perspective, Apples Siri for example fails miserably not due to the lack of data but an inability to understand simple English. In the end the only way to do ML and keep data safe is to keep the data on the device. 
Definitely the best way to tackle this. Automaticdimension is your best friend on a table view with dynamic content!
Developers? Yes sure, Swift has such high adoption among us. But Apple? Not yet. That’s why I have such high hopes about Swift community. I totally agree with keeping data on device. But as for the Siri not understanding English? It could be the case of lack of data. Not much is hard coded there (probably). So either Siri suck on concept level or there was not enough of data to train on. 
Is there such a thing for OS X apps?
By not understanding English I mean taking a voice request and translating it into text perfectly and then returning a query that makes absolutely no sense at all. For example driving down the road and saying to Siri: I need a map to Muncy PA. After several try I never did get the maps app to pop up with a map to Muncy. It is like Siri couldn't understand that when I ask for a map I want the maps app to pop up. Extremely frustrating and it isn't something that requires any personal data what so ever. In a nut shell Siri is pretty stupid. Many of the things I would want it to do for me simply doesn't require any personal data.
I don’t do a lot of OS X development but I don’t think there is a property like this for NSTableView. You can find a possible way to do this here though https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7504546/view-based-nstableview-with-rows-that-have-dynamic-heights/8054170#8054170
Thanks!! 
Hey it’s tumblr ✨
I'm working on an inventory software for parcel services. I'm using firebase as a back end, and I'm integrating a point of sale and shipping services. I'm going to use QR codes to allow location logging. IE you can scan the QR on the item and the QR on the shelf to update the location. This means I'm also going to end up setting up 4x6 label printer support and email notifications. 
That's sweet. So it basically extends the functionality of spotlight to include multiple accounts on multiple services? That would even be useful on a phone, especially if you piped in voice. 
Thank you! You verified that I was doing it right, so I looked for another place I was screwing up. Turns out, I was not using application/JSON as content-type in my header.
Ugh I hate when that happens. I just had that happen with a new build of some OCR software I use. Massive convention changes are going to cause me to do a rewrite of a whole module. Best of luck man. 
It's funny how, almost any time someone posts a problem with their code, the problem turns out to be in the part of the code they *didn't* post...
I think we might be talking about 2 kinds of learning there. Siri needs loads of data to understand English at all. It doesn't have to be your personal data but if Apple would use everyone's data (Google style) they would definitely have a significant headstart in many projects including Siri. With their commitment (I guess we have to take their word) to our privacy, they have to be creative which apparently doesn't always work.
As an author who writes to teach you'd figure that you would understand the value of implementing something for education's sake...
Hi guys, just published one of my first Swift frameworks, it’s a wrapper for the Instagram API. I would love to receive some feedback as I’m still a junior developer on Swift, also I’m open to contributions to the project! Thanks!
You can most likely do number 2. I would suggest adding anything new in swift, but if there is a need to refactor or to add a lot of functionality, you can make that in swift, or if it's a small fix, make it in objective C. I've been using the DevSlopes objective C for swift developers to learn some objective C, and it seems pretty good so far. Then you can just slowly refactor everything ones class at a time. 
Got it working. The delegate had changed in Swift 4, but the documentation wasn't up to date...and no build errors at all. Strangely, the way we fixed it was during a code review it was suggested that I use the auto-fill and retype the function - and it worked, the delegate call name and some of the parms had changed, and that fixed that part. A couple of other name changes later, and it is being tested in UAT this week. Good luck on your OCR piece.
 Yeah but how would I fix that?
They are included in the Helper.swift file that the project mentions.
No, that does not count as encryption.
It depends on the size of your app, but I personally would leave the Objective-C parts alone and start adding new features in Swift. Objective-C really isn't that difficult to start using if you're already familiar with Swift. They both use the same Frameworks for their method/properties are the same. The biggest difference is how you work with them as well as language specific differences.
`photoURL` is not a dictionary, it is an array. The numbers 0-3 are telling you what each object is at its corresponding index.
Thank you 👌🏼
Adafruit has a guide for this: https://learn.adafruit.com/crack-the-code/introduction Then again I'm not sure if its exactly what you're looking for but its Bluetooth, and in Swift, but I think it's more to connect with their BlueFruit devices. 
1) Although most Objective-C source code can be easily translated to Swift, it is quite possible to write Objective-C that is difficult to translate. 2) You can add new features in Swift. You'll need to use Xcode's Build Settings to give the path to an Objective-C .h file so it will create the bridging header for you. https://github.com/DavidPhillipOster/TextKit_LineNumbers is a simple example. Look at the bridging header build setting in the Swift Xcode project. Note that the Swift Xcode project has as its source files a mix of Objective-C and Swift source files. 3) Objective-C is worth learning. It is mostly C with a small number of extensions. You don't need to prefer it. You don't even need to like it. But you will be able to get more done if you aren't afraid to use libraries written in Objective-C and C, and if you can debug into them if you need to.
No matter whether you pick 1 or 2, you'll need to do 3. The good news is that (assuming you know C) it's super simple.
This would be for a swift hacker. For a true swift developer, the back should say "Because I would like to conditionally unwrap you with a guard statement specifying a fall back scenario in the event that you unwrap to nil."
It’s basically impossible to say without more information. If you post the complete Xcode output of the error, then maybe someone can shed some light onto the problem.
Can confirm. Talked to Apple about it at WWDC16. HTTPS is fine.
&gt; Swift tends to handle more requests and performs better overall, According to that page, it's worse on the latency side. In the case of Vapor, it's over twice as bad. You don't say what kind of game it is but I would think latency would be more important. &gt; but I do not know how Swift stands on the stability scale. You don't say what *kind* of stability you're asking about. You've used Swift, so you should be well aware that it's not terribly stable as a language -- there's been a new major release every year for the past 3 years. Vapor and Perfect are even younger. If stability is a primary concern, the newest major language in the world is not the best place to look for it. Are you going to be running this on Linux? I've run into lots of unexpected issues trying to move Swift code between platforms. A lot of common tasks that you think should be the same everywhere (like [sorting a list of strings](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-530)) behave differently. FWIW, Swift and Node are perhaps the two most different languages I can think of, on every axis, and I'm not sure what kind of requirements you had to end up with these two. Unless I had a major legacy codebase I wanted to re-use, neither of these would be among my top choices for a server.
If it’s static typing you’re after I’d also consider typescript w node 
https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide#type-inference
var x = 10 "Swift uses type inference extensively, allowing you to omit the type or part of the type of many variables and expressions in your code. For example, instead of writing var x: Int = 0, you can write var x = 0, omitting the type completely—the compiler correctly infers that x names a value of type Int." https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH31-ID457
var x = 10 Because ‘inferred’ is the preferred way
In the case where you actually need a type, I prefer `let x: Set = [1, 2]`.
I suggest wrapping the various stringly APIs you're interacting with like the authorization scope or relationship modification actions. Also, a request router pattern like you usually see with Alamofire might reduce some of the boilerplate you have for making requests. 
What’s the difference between this and the old database?
Really appreaciate your feedback man, I would definetely think about adding Alamofire to my library. Also, I really like the idea of wrapping the auth scope, the relationship modifications are already wrapped (followUser(), unfollowUser(), etc). Thanks for your time!
I don't usually recommend adding dependencies to libraries like this, some developers don't seem to like what they consider a base dependency having other dependency. My point was just to take a look at Alamofire and see if their patterns could help your request creation. As for the stringly APIs, I meant the `action` values themselves could be wrapped, if only for your own internal use. A simple enum would likely be enough.
From the linked page: “Cloud Firestore is inspired by what developers love most about the Firebase Realtime Database while also addressing its key limitations like data structuring, querying, and scaling.” The RTDB hs always been limited by its structure. What made it so fast and scalable is also what made it impossible to use with complex queries, it looks like this is what they’re trying to address with this new service
Yep, you're right, thanks again!
This solved it. Thank you! As a followup (just so I don't have to create a whole new post), do you know what happens to Local notifications that are set to repeat when the user has denied authorization for sending notifications? For example: &gt;While the user has denied notification authorization I set a local notification to repeat at 12:00 every day. At 11:30 the user grants me authorization to send local notifications. What happens at 12? Does the notification send as it was scheduled or does it never get set because I didn't have permission? Thanks again!
My bad, I thought local notifications were a subset of push notifications (with remote notifications being the other type). My question was about local notifications.
I didn't see anything on pricing, but this sounds like it could potentially be a nice replacement for Realm databases and their high price point.
Their pricing is right up there with the documentation. $0.06 per 100.000 reads and $0.18 per 100.000 writes. Sounds pretty reasonable compared to the RTDB pricing which was $5/GB I believe 
Oh nice thanks for the info, I'm going to have to look into this more tonight!
The first error is... FirstViewController.swift:13:50: error: use of undeclared type 'MKMapViewDelegate' class FirstViewController: UIViewController, MKMapViewDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegate { The second one is... FirstViewController.swift:16:37: error: use of undeclared type 'MKMapView' @IBOutlet weak var mapView: MKMapView! The third one is... FirstViewController.swift:16:28: error: 'weak' may only be applied to class and class-bound protocol types, not '&lt;&lt;error type&gt;&gt;' @IBOutlet weak var mapView: MKMapView! I have all the MapKit framework already added.
Okay, again, all these errors are caused by Xcode not being able to build the MapKit module. So, all references to MapKit cause build errors. I can’t tell from the information provided why Xcode won’t build the module.
Sorry but I am just not understanding how I get the information that you need to solve the issue?
You’re going to have to improvise.
No, this does not prevent new instances being created, i.e. a singleton. This code is written by someone who is new to Swift and doesn’t really understand the language, yet. It achieves nothing over: Class LoginServices { static let instance = .init() } Also, it should have a semantic name, like `shared`, or ‘default`.
I've tried creating a swift package but adding a Cocoa Framework/dylib to a Command Line Tool has been pretty challenging. Have you had any success with this? I get a crash at runtime: Library not loaded Reason: Image not found 
You could go with Kitura which is almost similar to Express.js. Skills could easily be transferable. 
Aye, appreciate the input! For larger projects would it be possible to pass an arg to 'swiftc' to compile EVERYTHING in its dir and subdirs? I did 'swiftc --help' but didnt see anything apropos I'm just trying to consider a project with many .swift files
Sure, if you have a directory say myDir with several swift files inside you could do a recursive descent with: swiftc $(find myDir -regex “.*.swift”) -o outputFile This is using a relative path for myDir and, depending on your current working directory, you may need to use the absolute path. 
The best way to import frameworks into Swift Package Manager projects is to add them as a dependency. If you build an executable, these will be compiled and included in the binary as a static library. This will only work for Swift frameworks. If you want to include other frameworks or libraries into Swift Package Manager projects, things will get more difficult. Maybe the [Swift Package Manager documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#require-system-libraries) can be of help to you.
Not really, if we consider more or less sophisticated cases. Just take a look at how it manages to deal with RAC. And even if you find the leak, you would still have to weakify the function call in the callback, which you could do either manually, using Chris Zablockis approach from his strongify lib or the approach I presented.
I totally fell in love with you nickname, sir/lady.
&gt; Is there any circumstance in which you would use a UITextField without assign the delegate? Sure. They're methods for customizing how editing works. If the default editing is fine for you, then you don't need the delegate. &gt; If so, why use the delegate at all, You don't need to. The delegate itself is optional, right? &gt; or at a minimum have one required delegate method? Huh? &gt; Doesn't this break MVC because the view object would need to handle all of the logic as well as display? I'm not sure what you're getting at. You can make the delegate any object you want. You *can* make it one that violates your architecture, but you don't have to.
Sorry I’m not sure about that. I’ve never tested that use case. 
I meant array, but I guess I typed dictionary instead. My bad. I get the structure, I don't know how to parse it
Why do people hate ! so much? It's there to be used as a tool. Sometimes that statement is unreachable if it's nil. Sometimes, you want to generate a fatal error when it's nil. Specially before production.

Yes, you can use self-signed certificates.
I think you have to set the flag in your Info.plist to do this normally, which will trigger them asking you about it when you submit to the App Store. Fundamentally their issue isn't that they're self-signed--it's that lazy devs are much more likely to not verify at all. We have a network security-based app on the Mac and iOS app stores that talks with a local appliance that necessarily uses a self-signed certificate. The appliance registers its certificate with a web service of ours (which uses HTTPS with a normal trusted CA), which the app then fetches. As a result, the chain of trust isn't broken, even though it's a self-signed certificate. We were able to explain this to them and they allowed it. I don't know how easy it normally is to get them to allow it. Alternatively you could: * Rather than self-signing for your internal server certificate, create an internal CA and sign all of them with that CA. * Add the CA to each device as a trusted root. \* This would make them trust your CA just like they trust any other CA. \* There's a multi-step manual process, but the more "proper" way of doing this would be by using an MDM. ...or if you're not planning to distribute via the App Store, you can just set the flag in your Info.plist and be on your way.
You access the elements by calling `photoURL[0]` where 0 is the index you want.
That's really strange – you're using WatchKit and trying to use `UITableViewCell` at the same time, which doesn't really make sense. `UITableViewCell` has never been available on watchOS, so I'm struggling to see how this code ever compiled!
Hmm, odd! How do you create a custom cell for WatchKit then? It's worked just fine for me since the Apple Watch was first released.
I have [answered your question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46567226/5041820) – I have to admit I'm pretty amazed this ever compiled! 
&gt; answered your question on StackOverflow Thanks. It's very odd. I just opened up an old archived copy of my app from multiple versions ago, released in App Store, and it had this same code back then!
If my answer solves the problem, please take a moment to mark it as correct on StackOverflow – it helps other people who might hit the same problem later, and of course I relish those delicious virtual internet points :)
Np, thanks anyway!
Signing with your own CA is fairly straightforward, so long as you're managing the connections yourself (NSURLSession etc.) and not using a web view, as getting WebKit to recognize your CA cert is non-trivial. If the cert is just for the https traffic to the server with the JSON, which you manage, you're better off with a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) cert: they're free and legit, though you will have to update them every few months.
This would prevent new instances from being created: Class LoginServices { static let sharedInstance = .init() private init() { //… } }
I prefer explicitly using the `init` method that I want rather than letting the compiler choose. So I'd rather do: var x = Int(10) To me that's less ambiguous. I'm obviously creating a new instance and initializing it through an `init` method. Behind the scenes both ways are doing the same thing so it comes down to preference.
&gt; an app that will be querying locally stored JSON data sounds like an enterprise app to me https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/
I don't know the answer, but while playing around with it I kept crashing the compiler. [Here's one simplified case](http://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl/59d53d2fac0e971e4c05800d). PATs seem like one of those areas that might be a good idea if you *really* know what you're doing, and a boatload of pain if you don't. The compiler is still crashy enough you can't really figure them out by trial-and-error.
Any reason not to just use a [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) cert?
The crash is certainly a bug, but the code in that example is nonsense. T isn't an actual type, it's a stand-in for a type to be filled in later. You can't subclass T nor conform to T because it's not a class or a protocol, so of course the compiler isn't going to accept your definition of B. This is probably what you meant to write: protocol P { associatedtype T } class A: P { class T { } } Or even: class A: P { typealias T = B class B { } } If the protocol had a method or property of type T you could even leave out the type alias: protocol P { associatedtype T var foo: T { get } } class A: P { class B { } public let foo = B() } Because the compiler knows that `foo` is a `T`, therefore `A.T` must be the type of `A.foo` which is `A.B`.
I think you want: ``` static func inject( with dependencies: Dependencies, from storyboard: UIStoryboard) -&gt; Self ``` instead of: ``` static func inject&lt;T: UIViewController &amp; Injectable&gt;( with dependencies: Dependencies, from storyboard: UIStoryboard) -&gt; T ```
Yes, as a program, it's nonsense. That's why I called it a "simplified case". The whole purpose is to show the crash. Between the Swift Language book lying about PATs, and many mistakes resulting in a compiler crash, I'm finding PATs rather difficult to use. And I don't seem to be the only one!
[removed]
Thanks for the thorough information it helps a lot! I’ll see what I can get away with and change if needed! 
Thanks. I was thinking letsencrypt but as it is all internal communication I don’t think letsencrypt would allow internal DNS names which aren’t public. I’ll dig a bit deeper before discounting it though.
Thanks I’ll look into it. I’m looking to sell the solution to companies so may not be able to go that route. (The server and IOS Application. Though IOS app would be free)
Now I completely confused. &gt; Sure. They're methods for customizing how editing works. If the default editing is fine for you, then you don't need the delegate. I thought that the UITextField has no default editing. It can detect changes in the text field, but then those changes are messaged out to the delegate. It is because of this that I couldn't understand under what circumstances the UITextField could function without the delegate. Am I wrong? Thanks.
Quick answer is that you need to define Dependencies in your inject function parameter as T.Dependencies so that the compiler knows that the parameter is the same type of dependency as that of T.
Simplifying the function to return Self instead of T also works, and makes the code easier to read. Since, in this case, Self satisfies the same constraints that T does.
&gt; I thought that the UITextField has no default editing. Why? New iOS project, add a UITextField and a UIButton. Drag an outlet for the UITextField, and an action for the UIButton. On click, use the value of `myTextField.text`. [No delegate needed.](https://imgur.com/a/Knzoz) 
You’re right that is cleaner. 👍🏻 
&gt; Why? The documentation from Apple, which is daunting as is, lists: "Validating Text and Managing the Editing Process A text field manages the editing of its text with the help of its delegate object. As the user interacts with a text field, the text field notifies its delegate and gives it a chance to control what is happening. You can use the delegate methods to prevent the user from starting or stopping the editing process or to validate text as it is typed. You can also use the delegate methods to perform related tasks, such as updating other parts of your interface based on the information typed by the user. For more information about using the text field’s delegate to manage editing interactions, see UITextFieldDelegate." From this I looked at the delegate documentation and noticed that none of the methods are required, which made absolutely no sense to me. Please don't misunderstand, I am very grateful for your help and I am doing my best to not come off as a complete ass. I have been working on trying to understand this forever and you have been very generous with your time and knowledge.
What's the lie, and where in the book is it?
If you haven't already, look into [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/). It's the officially-supported way to build command-line tools that are larger than a single file. Even though there's a REPL and you can run single scripts from the command-line, Swift is not really a scripting language. There's no way to "import" single other files into your own like you can in Ruby, for example. The way to combine 2 files is to compile them into an executable and run that.
I think the key word in that paragraph is "can". You certainly *can* use the delegate to do those things, if those are things you want to do. But often you don't need to do any of those things. 
They have not so many difference so you can learn Swift 3 and read changes if you use Xcode 8 but if you use Xcode 9 better to learn Swift 4
Is there a way to still get xcode 8? 
Someone here is shadowbanned. Anyways, I would find a project and find the tutorials you need to do it. Doubt there is a ton of difference. 
Now official last version is Xcode 9 so I think no. But if you only begin to learn so I think better to start from the newest
What's shadowbanned? Yeah just took a look at the changes not much difference so I think maybe swift 3 then just update after
Go to the downloads page. Google it. 
Yes there is. We had to go back since some of our pods don’t support 9. 
Than you can download it from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ but if project is not large I think easier to made some fixes and stay in Xcode 9 with swift 4
Just use Xcode 9 and Swift 4. The Swift 3 tutorials will still be 99% usable. Swift 4 isn't different enough to cause you big problems. 
Just start with Swift 4, there are just a few new libraries and minor changes. For beginner 3 and 4 is almost identical.
Thank you. I'll definitely look into this. But yes this seems to be my first lesson in the benefits of an interpreted language. I'll likely fall back to Python for these sorts of tools.
Thanks! I wasn't familiar with this tool. I just used cocoapods (which I've become pretty fond of). 
Awesome - Much appreciated! 
In the past with Swift 1, 2, 3 the changes would sometimes break code. As of Swift 3 they said this should not happen anymore. Swift 4 seems to just have some smaller changes, nothing major changed. Most guides and stuff are going to be in Swift 3, not much out there for Swift 4 yet, but if you copy Swift 3 tutorials, Xcode will usually correct you on things that changed.
I'm kind of lost here. I tried to look this up, but boy, nothing comes up. Do I embed the cell in a UIStackView and how exactly would I reuse the UIImageView as many times as needed per each post (i.e one post could have 1 image, another might have 9). This is where I'm kinda lost. I haven't done this before 
I have no idea what your JSON looks like so I have no way to test this (MCVE?), but shouldn't there be a `.dictionaryValue` in there, if you want to index by string? And maybe an `.arrayValue`, for the list?
What type is `value`?
value seems to be being detected as type "Any" which would mean you need to cast it as a Dictionary to access it using dictionary syntax. You'd do the same for arrays as well. Swift doesn't know what snapshot is, just that Firebase brought back some data.
So I should do something like let title = snapshot.Value as! [String: String] ? But I just wanna do something like if the forkey is Post1 then print the value 
Keep in mind that `print`-ing something and seeing a string doesn’t mean that something is a `String`
I believe so, but I'm not sure. It depends on what firebase is returning for you. Since you're accessing with brackets, that means you're trying to use it as a collection, like an array or dictionary. You need to cast snapshot.value as something, and I assume you're trying to access the value that corresponds to the key "Det", which you seem to want to be Post1, which would look like ["Det":"Post1", "...":"...", etc]. What does the Firebase DB look like?
Try using .stringValue self.coinList.append(coin.1["name"].stringValue) Or My Alamofire request varies from what you have, mine is Alamofire.request(url).responseJSON { (response) -&gt; Void in if let value = response.result.value { let json = JSON(value) //while loop I needed to replace some characters in the strings I receive (news titles), so I used: let title: String? = json["posts"][indexNum]["title"].stringValue let cleanTitle = title?.replacingOccurances(blah blah blah) self.tableTitle.append(cleanTitle!)
I honestly hate those sliding menus. Tab bar is way better.
'Det' I just a sample I wrote, the thing I want to get the Value that corresponds with the key I input. My DB is just a child("Post") with a child with random id and the Dic "Det: Grim"
You need to get the value as an NSDictionary first. try this inside the closure instead let value = snapshot.value as? NSDictionary let title = value["Det"] as? String
Oh, .string*Value* I had tried .string but it returns an optional, whereas stringValue does not. I think it works now, thanks!
True, although the error did not say I was trying to initialize it with the wrong type. It was arguing with the subscript type when it allowed that subscript to print.
You should do both 2 and 3. As an ios dev you will pretty much never be senior without some minimal competence with obj-c, and I say that as an ardent swift booster. It's not that hard to learn if you already know swift. Bridging headers work fine and are a lot easier than re-writing files you're not otherwise going to touch. I would definitely recommend annotating models and other commonly used obj-c files for nullability. That'll save you a lot of grief with optionals that shouldn't be optionals. Personally, I write anything new in swift and only convert obj-c to swift when I expect to be editing over, say, a quarter or a third of the file. Less than that and it's just not worth the aggravation. I find it's easiest to use a tool like https://objectivec2swift.com to get you 90% of the way there and then manually fix the bazillion errors and miscellaneous cruft the script results in. It's still a PITA though.
If you try to pass a `Double` constant to the `CGPoint` initializer, it will convert it automatically to `CGFloat`, but if you try an expression that returns a `Double`, you will get "No such initializer" instead of "Wrong type". Swift is like that sometimes.
I'll have to try again when I get home but, I was using .dictionary and .array instead of .dictionaryValue and .arrayValue, and getting nil values. It would probably be easier to access it using that if it works.
Oh, interesting. Good to know, thanks. I did try using .string and still had issues, but I realize now that I need to use .stringValue.
not so many difference**s*** difference = one thing is different and one thing only differences = more than one thing is different That's how it works in English.
Sorry, English is not my native language
Yes. Log in to the developer page and then go here. https://developer.apple.com/download/more 
Hmm it doesn't come up with any error, but It doesn't seem to print anything in console when I call print(title)
No problem. So what you want to do is create a new class that inherits from UITableViewCell. In the xib you will add a UIStackView + all other items in there. Create an IBOutlet in the class code and then you'll add a method that receives a UIImage as a parameter. In code you'll make a UIImageView, instantiate it with said image and add it as an arranged subview. If you set up your constraints correctly the cell should grow as big as is needed. However because the cells are reusable, usually I would have a method that removes all the subviews in a stack view every time a cell is dequeued and then add all the correct images that are supposed to be displayed. 
It's likely then that title is not actually retrieving the data you want. Can you provide a screenshot of your firebase DB and the node which you want to access for a more in depth solution? 
I dont know how to post images in a comment but my DB looks something like fitter-6762b Post -KvhidP_ZISPi9xANisr Post1: 'Description' I wanna get Description value for the forkey post1. Thats it
Everyone has their preferences! Tab bars are sexy too.
Creating my own on-demand service (app) on iOS.
After the .child("Post") in your snapshot you also need to add .child(NextNode e.g. KvhidP....) I assume that's a user which you should have stored somewhere in your code. So you'd do .child("Post").child(YourUser) Then in the dictionary you'd do value["Post1"] which should print out 'Description'
I haven't made any user yet, just trying to understand how to work with Firebase and swift
Same. While I appreciate the post because clients ask for this explicitly sometimes, Tab bar is definitely more preferred.
Thank you! I guess I'll be making another article + video relating tab bars then :) 
You can't trust Swift compiler messages. They are often completely unrelated to the actual issue.
If you had a DB in firebase that looked something like: -Users -RedditUser1 -DOB : 01/01/1970 -Address : 1 Reddit Lane You'd access the DOB of RedditUser1 by taking a snapshot of the database reference then the children down the tree until you get the required user then using that snapshot as a dictionary to access the desired property. For example it would look something like this (please forgive the typing, I'm typing on my phone with no reference in front of me) databaseReference.child("Users").child("RedditUser1").childAdded etc... (snapshot) in { Let value = snapshot.value as? NSDictionary Let usersDOB = value["DOB"] as? string 
But I have a Random Identifier instead if DOB?
If it's completely random I assume you wrote to the database via swift code, rather than input it yourself. Like a chat application or a collection of posts? In that case, if you want to retrieve all posts you can nest these database reference calls. Using the original snapshot value to give you every random identifier, loop through those and get the .child("post1") or whatever it is to return the description. If it's a chat app or user posts usually you'd likely just have a User with posts then each postID would be the randomly generated one with an associated value being the message or actual post 
They idea is to have a Tinder like image load thing where. I wanna retrieve a picture displaying it and if you press next picture you will end up with a new one, likely the newest posted. Should I add a custom every time a user posts a new image?
I just read Medium articles
I recently launched [Swift Developer News](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles) – I try to post something each weekday, whether that's a link to an interesting tutorial, an interview, a news story, or whatever. [There's an RSS feed](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/rss) if that's your thing.
Read up on delegates. You need to create a protocol and implement it. Also simply find iOS free course on iTunes U from Stanford which goes through it. 
What you want can be achieved by creating a new file where you dump the function and call it in both ViewControllers
You will need to modify the call stack yourself. There is not enough information to answer your question properly. But the whole point of modal views is that they block UI until selection is made. You can either use delegate or closure which will get executed with the result when the controller is dismissed

Hacking With Swift is very popular. 
I just started learning Swift and I am going through [this] (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) resource from Apple. Started [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH2). I am using [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) for iPad to go through it. I don't own a MacBook yet, but aim to get one in the coming months. These should serve as a good starting point. Welcome! :) Edit: formatting
Are there any specific authors or "interests" I should follow aside from just Swift? 
I'll check it out. Thanks for creating the collection of articles! 
I've been using Swift Playgrounds . I think it's great. Any other things I can check out?
What instance of SecondViewController would it call this method on, if that object might not exist yet? Do you have an MCVE that demonstrates the issue?
I have no input except that I too would like to find something like this. 
That is why I really enjoyed Simon Ng's "Beginning iOS 10 Programming with Swift" eBook - very well written, and steps you through the process in small steps, with lots of screenshots and explanations. Here is the URL: https://www.appcoda.com/swift/ (and no, I have no affiliation with appcoda, I'm just a very satisfied customer)

Is hacking with swift legit? Is it any good?
Yes, I have used his books in the past, Paul Hudson teaches Swift really well.
Yeah, I also hate them. If you are putting one, don't put it on the least reachable place on the phones screen (top left). And make it fast to slide, not the typical 5 seconds!
I'd like to think it's legit – I'm the author :) If you want, you can read [the entirety of my first book online for free](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) and make up your own mind.
Thank you! I'm glad to hear you enjoy my approach :)
The current ‘gold standard’ example on Vapor is probably the blogging engine [SteamPress](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPress).
Perhaps you could store the name locally? Or maybe even use a dictionary? Idk how airdrop works but you could just store te name when u send it and then call upon the name later 
I'd be up for this. I've done a few tutorials but I'm still in the 'in one ear, out the other' phase. 
~~The ‘is’ operator should do the trick~~ ~~‘if vehicle is Car {}’~~ Use optional casting
Great I will DM you
I would be up for this!
Interested also. Going through some courses on Udemy atm starting app building now :P
Nothing against the is operator, but I think optional casting (if let p = vehicle as? Plane) would be better as you'll certainly want to be referencing the object as it's subclass so why not combine test and cast.
That is what I ended up doing. Thanks.
I’m down!
 switch vehicle { case is Car: … case is Train: … case is Plane: … }
I’d be down
I am so down. With anybody commenting in here too. Probably set up a schedule with our time zones. 
Not sure about catching events in a UIBarButtonItem, but as far as the spacing your X and Y have no effect for navigation bar button position, just frame size. I think you can use contentInsets, imageInsets, and titleEdgeInsets. If those don't work I think I created a second fixed width bar button with a negative width, and put it to the left of my real button. You can set the left bar button items to an array instead of just one. More details later, on mobile now
Thanks a lot, I will attempt some of these fixes in the mean time.
I just started here. Less than a week. I’m doing ARKit and CoreML. It’s difficult. @.@

Why do these sorts of things have to wait for Xcode 9.1/iOS 11.1/probably the iPhone X release? I really wish the Xcode team would be more proactive about their updates and do a 9.0.1 release with the fixes they've already shown. Why make us wait?
Beta releases give them time to get feedback from testers before unleashing new features on everyone; I think that's a wise approach.
If they were creating new features, sure. But you don't need a 6 week beta period for bug fixes which have already gone through the entire compiler development process, including testing. Plus, since they don't allow you to ship code with beta version of Xcode, they don't get nearly enough beta usage to be a good test. Even if they did, it obviously isn't enough, given their current quality, so I'd rather take the fixes as they come. That way Apple isn't reliant on a single beta period for everything in 9.1 and can instead spread the work around be bit more. But no, everything has to be packed into a single release.
``` switch vehicle { case let v as Car: handleCar(v) case let v as Bus: handleBus(v) .... } ```
You're printing a title outside of a closure, which is the title of viewController. Learn multithreading and namespaces before you go any further.
I just got through the first project in Hacking with Swift a few nights ago, this would be great 
&gt; But the Vehicle superclass has no properties that describe either miles per gallon or how far the train can travel. What is the best way to handle this in Swift? Maybe I'm not understanding the problem, but the obvious solution to me is "add a property/function to Vehicle, so each one can report how far it can go".
What layout is used for CollectionView? are willDisplay/didDisplay-cell methods implemented ?
&gt; If they were creating new features, sure. I'm not sure what your definition of "feature" is, but this absolutely looks like a new feature to me. &gt; But you don't need a 6 week beta period for bug fixes which have already gone through the entire compiler development process, including testing. Except, it hasn't. Your comment is literally proposing to remove part of this testing process. &gt; Plus, since they don't allow you to ship code with beta version of Xcode, they don't get nearly enough beta usage to be a good test. This is a developer-side tool that helps you track down bugs in your own program. You can absolutely *develop* your application with the Xcode 9.1 beta, and use this to track down bugs. You just have to build it with Xcode 9.0 for the actual MAS upload. &gt; Even if they did, it obviously isn't enough, given their current quality, so I'd rather take the fixes as they come. Quality isn't good enough, therefore they should do *less* testing? The whole point of beta testing is to ensure that these fixes are truly fixes, and don't break critical functionality in other areas. Are you suggesting that beta tests never find any bugs at all, or are you saying you want the release versions of Xcode to have more bugs? Your suggestion is the opposite of what other successful industries do, when they want reliable products. When three 737's crash in a year, Boeing *doesn't* say "Let's disband the FAA. It costs time and money, and if passengers are going to crash anyway, at least we can save them money and get them there faster".

I just wish they could distribute the updates more efficiently. The Mac AppStore can handle delta updates to betas of the entire OS, so surely it can handle Xcode. Sure, they want to keep the GM version and beta separate, but surely they could add a temporary “Xcode beta” app and give us delta updates that way. Or even build something more elaborate if they want - if Apple has a use case, it’s likely others will too, but unlike those others Apple control the AppStore.
[Here's the collectionView's init](https://imgur.com/a/BM5HM). I'm using UICollectionViewFlowLayout. I have not implemented those methods.
They can beta test the two new features in 9.1 all they want, I'd like the dozen bug fixes they've already tested now. It's endemic to their entire release process. They need to divorce Xcode releases from iOS versions so we don't have to wait a year to get bug fixes. You want an effective beta process? More betas more often, not a few betas for the few major or minor releases you do, but testable builds on a regular basis that include bug fixes that you won't have to wait months to use. Fewer builds means fewer opportunities to fix bugs. Locking them to unreleased iOS versions means you can't publish apps, which means far fewer beta testers since most don't want to have to switch back and forth. Separating the IDE from the SDKs would help a lot too, allowing testing of features like the new fatal error handling without having to worry about a beta SDK as well. 
I'm down as well! 
It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the UICollectionViewFlowLayout keeps a strong references to the cells that it's laying out.
You're creating a view controller called `destination` in the dismiss closure. What are you expecting that to do? 
I'm using `destination` to pass a property to the destination viewcontroller and should have removed it from the code for this post. I've removed it now.
"Sometimes, you want to generate a fatal error when it's nil" You certainly might, but if you've ever debugged a codebase sprinkled with implicitly unwrapped optionals, you get tired of the message "found nil when unwrapping blank". If you want this functionality, use the swift `precondition()` method, and provide a more descriptive message. "Sometimes that statement is unreachable if it's nil." So you want your app to crash? Thats some stinky UX. Either conditionally unwrap it (`guard let`, `if let`), use nil coalescence (` nil ?? ""`), or use optional chaining (`object?.optionalProerty`). Your app crashing on the user is a bug, not a feature. Additionally, implicitly unwrapping optional values with a `!` as a habit leads to unmaintainable, fragile code which tends to have a single "happy path" and falls over easily when async programming / networking / error handling become a requirement and not a nice to have. Thoughts?
Hahaha! There are so many swift sources to learn from, it's hard to choose which one to delve into!
Awesome.
Nope. Sorry.

Advanced Swift. 
I've recently started working at my current place. The source code I'm working with is older than XCode 4. Not even any storyboards. I'm pushing to redo as much of the code as possible. I'm also contributing to Hacktoberfest 
I think storyboards have pros and cons and should be picked based on what meets your needs: Pros: * Quicker setup of ui elements. * Guides use it, so easier to learn/use others work with it. * Provides a high level view of the applications user experience. * Constraint hierarchy is a good way to control your content on a variety of screen sizes/devices (see cons). Cons: * Not ideal for projects with many developers - merge conflicts are a nightmare to resolve (can't stress this enough). * You'll eventually need a ui element that is difficult or impossible to achieve with storyboard alone. * Figuring out constraint hierarchies and priorities is a steep learning curve. Ultimately I think knowing the programmatic way to construct views and constraints is useful and increases the flexibility you have as a developer. I use custom ui elements in my storyboard and it helps get the best of both worlds. 
Personally I don’t use them... but then again I still use Objective C so maybe I’m just set in my ways. I find it so easy to initialize a view controller and present it in code that I guess I haven’t felt a compelling need to jump into storyboards. Also my company has made it clear they are not about to pony up for a nice monitor or display and it really blows trying to look at even a simple storyboard layout on a sub-HD monitor. I may treat myself to a nice (cheap) 4K monitor this year and revisit storyboards at some point.
Trying to create a template for Albert launcher in Linux.
I would typically handle that scenario with an array that holds a reference to each button, bind each button to the same IBAction and make sure it has a parameter for the sender, and use the .selected UIControlState to indicate which button is currently active. Here's the general idea (didn't try compiling this so I might have missed something): let allButtons = [firstButton, secondButton, thirdButton, fourthButton, fifthButton] @IBAction func buttonClicked(sender: UIButton) { allButtons.forEach { $0.selected = false } sender.selected = true let buttonIndex = allButtons.index(of: sender) doSomethingInterestingWithTheButtonIndex(buttonIndex) }
I tried subclassing UIButton to add a property to it: isActive which is of type Bool. What I wanted to do was a for loop that was like for btn in allButtons { btn.isActive = false } .....and then get say like sender.selected = true but I am still struggling with the subclass
I'm not sure subclassing UIButton makes the most sense to accomplish what you're wanting. UIButton already has a boolean property to indicate a selected state (.selected), and has built-in mechanisms to control button styling when the .selected property is modified. My solution above will set the .selected property to true for the tapped button, set the .selected property to false for all the other buttons, and then give you an index indicating which button was tapped, which you could then use for whatever logic you want to hook to the button tap. If your intent for wanting to subclass UIButton was to extract this logic for reuse elsewhere, I'd suggest creating an entirely new class responsible for managing a collection of buttons that registers its own function as the target for the tap and performs whatever reusable logic you want when one of the buttons in the collection is tapped.
Looooool, don’t get discouraged. ARKit is actually fairly straight forward (as far as Apple API’s go..), haven’t jumped into ML. It’s important to keep your enthusiasm up while you learn, but you’ll hit a threshold where you need to learn low-level concepts: 1) MVC, and other, design principles (particularly the *why* behind MVC) 2) ARC memory management ^^ these are two that will be helpful when building your base level of knowledge 
What do you mean by control exactly?

Working to release version 7.1.0 of what I believe to be the most configurable Swift iOS calendar library on github -&gt; https://github.com/patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar If it has helped any of you guys in your projects, feel free to leave a star rating. Thanks so much for the support. Its been an awesome journey thus far.

I'm still writing, rounding up the first third of my book [Swift in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/swift-in-depth), so that it can go to a bigger team of editors and developers for review. It has a special reddit 50% discount code: **swiftindepthreddit** . This applies to both paperbook and ebook till October 12. 
If it does, do you know how to make sure this reference is removed when the CollectionView is removed?
Personally I prefer to build views programmatically but as /u/A_stoner_once_said, it really depends on what kind of application your are building.
this sounds like a classic case of incorrect architecture, your model should represent is something is selected, not your UI, your UI only responds to model changes.
I am currently working on fixing up a project I built for school which would interact with a time-series database through a custom built API. This db was filled with Air Quality (the name of the project) data that was retrieved through an Arduino device that used gas sensors along with a GSM module to interact. The data in the database would be presented in an iOS app that would allow the user to easily see and track the data over time. 
No, if you have read what I am trying to do I am clearly stating i want to write logic that is reusable and clean. If I wanted to do it how you are accusing me I could have but it would be repetitive and cumbersome. 
Picking back up with a note taking app now I have some time to dedicate to it.

I loathe dealing with Obj-C now. 
If you're trying to call a method from SecondViewController before its viewDidLoad() is called, it sounds like maybe you're not interested in calling any particular instance of SecondViewController. If that's the case, the simplest solution is to make buttonAction() a static method. Then you can call SecondViewController.buttonAction() without needing to actually create any instances of SecondViewController. (As an architectural note, if that is your usecase, then buttonAction() should *probably* not be defined in a ViewController class) If, on the other hand, this is a situation where you want buttonAction() to be performed somewhere in the segue between FirstViewController and SecondViewController, then you can call it in FirstViewController's prepareForSegue method, which will have a reference to the upcoming SecondViewController instance that you can use
My colleagues and I recently released the experiment ["one picture"](https://www.onepicture.co). With this app we try to find an answer to the question: If every iPhone user could only take on picture, which one would it be?
Do you use default UICollectionViewFlowLayout or a custom one? If custom, can you please check if deinit is called in it? Probably UICollectionViewController holds strong reference to it
October is already proving to be a big month, and it's only just starting! **First, I'm busy working on a [SpriteKit book](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/dive-into-spritekit).** It's designed using an all-new teaching approach I don't think I've seen in programming books, but if you ever read Choose Your Own Adventure books when you were a kid you'll be familiar with the idea. The book gives you four SpriteKit projects, but at key points the book stops and asks you what should happen next. The choices you make then affect the way the rest of the project continues, so each of the four projects has 50+ possible variations depending on the path you choose. For example, in the first project should the player control a rocket flying through space, or a submarine in the sea? Should they move by tilting the device or by dragging the player around? Should they score points by staying alive as long as possible or by collecting power-ups? This approach means you can learn what interests you, and also that you can read the book more than once, make different choices, and end up with completely different games each time. Of course, if you'd much rather read a traditional linear SpriteKit book then you can just choose the first option each time and pretend the others don't exist :) [You can find out more about the book here.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/dive-into-spritekit) **Second, I'm launching my [first live workshops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/live), taught entirely online.** There are four in total: two on San Francisco time, and two on London time. Each of the workshops is a full day made up of six hour-long sessions, with short breaks between them plus a longer break for lunch. The regular ticket price is $100, which gives you access to the live stream and recorded session videos, plus one free book from my [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store) store, valid for six months from issuing. However, I've created a coupon that lets /r/swift save $10 on the ticket price – just enter "rswift" when registering for the course. [You can find out more about the workshops here.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/live) **Third, I just announced the [Swift Community Awards](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/awards)**. I hope it will help raise awareness of great Swift projects and people – everyone can nominate their project or their favorite project, so please take a moment to do so! **Fourth, I'm speaking at [#Pragma Conference](https://pragmaconference.com/) in Verona.** It's being held from the 11th to the 13th of October, and I'm delivering a full-day workshop on building macOS apps plus a regular talk on using Instruments – come and say hello! **Fifth, I'm continuing to write articles for a new section of my site called [Swift Developer News](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles).** My goal is to publish five a week, with a mix of news, interviews, tutorials, etc. There's an [RSS feed](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/rss) if that's your thing. Feel free to send me a message or tweet (@twostraws) if you've made something you think should be featured.
It's true – when I learned coding as a kid (a loooong time ago!), resources were preciously guarded and expensive, so when I bought a book you can be darn sure I read it cover to cover. Now we have so many resources you can almost get academic paralysis because you have no idea where to start or which to choose. Worse, because so much material (good and bad) is freely available, it's hard to knuckle down and stick with something for the long term so you really learn it.
I want to know if you typed this all directly into reddit, or into a word processor first. The formatting is very good, and this is only a minor post that won't get much attention. So either you are very accustomed to this, or you have a process.
Honestly, if I thought a) I had the support of the Vapor community, and b) Vapor was going to stay still long enough that the book could be out for six months without me having to make major changes, then I would seriously consider writing a Vapor edition. What I (obviously!) don't want to do is spend a huge amount of time writing a book only to make five sales and have it be outdated in three weeks. I realize that isn't a terribly helpful answer, but I hope it helps to know I'm certainly interested.
I use RES, like (surely?) everyone, so I just look at the live preview until I'm happy. Then check the links a dozen times each because I'm paranoid. Then recheck the links one last time… then post. (Then check the links again.)
Awesome! Thanks for choosing my book – I hope you enjoy it :) Don't be afraid to ask questions; I come here a lot, or you can find me on Twitter [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws), or even email works: paul@hackingwithswift.com.
OK; I'm a sucker for a sob story :) /u/StandNTroll: Send me an email (paul@hackingwithswift.com) and I'll send you a free copy of my [Practical iOS 11 book](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/practical-ios11). It isn't designed for beginners (you should read my free [Hacking with Swift book](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) for that), but it does cover Core ML, ARKit, and more, and might help you learn a little faster.
Thanks guys!
I'm using the default one. I will change it to a custom one and see if deinit is called when I get home. Just a follow up question: When the collectionVC is removed, there is no memory graph available for the collectionVC or the FlowLayout - does this mean that they don't hold a reference to anything anymore? Also, the memory graph for the collectionVC disappears, but there's still a 'UICollectionVC' node in the collection cell graph - why does this remain? Is it the same VC?
It sounds like you’re trying to make something that works like a UISegmentedControl. It’s possible to customise it to change the styling so long as you want the buttons to sit next to each other. Regarding your question when using UIButtons, having a single IBAction for multiple buttons is quite normal. You pass the button as the sender and use it to set your logic. In terms of changing the styling, you can subclass UIButton to override the styling when the button isActive or whatever, that’s perfectly straightforward. var isActive: Bool = false { didSet { // update the button style But you could also use the selected property as suggested above. 
I hadn't used it in ^years. But now I understand - it can be quite useful. Hopefully they'll make peace with Apple and bring it over to Safari. Glad I asked about it, though. 
You know, honestly I've used it so long now that I've forgotten where Reddit ends and RES starts – I'm rather surprised Reddit haven't managed to integrate a great many of its features directly into the site!
You can’t segue from a dismissing view controller. Inform v1 that it needs to segue to v3. 
Yes, all the time, I contract and see a lot of devs come and go, storyboards make it easy to understand stuff quickly and when used with something like a coordinator pattern you will see a storyboard with 1-3 VC's in at most. also helps visualise something like a paging VC with container and child VC's from a top level.
I love this idea for a programming book. You have piqued my curiosity. * edit. I have preordered the book. Once I saw it was your site, I decided to dive in, since you’ve been so helpful for my development. Thank you for your site!
Very kind – thank you! I'm glad my work has been useful. The book has been really fun to write so far, and I'm hoping that means it's really fun to read too :)
Every UIView item has a 'tag' field that is an integer. In IB go set up each button with a distinct number. Make sure when specifying the handler the first time that the parameter is of the type (UIButton) instead of a generic id. Then point all buttons at the same handler. At runtime inside the handler you get the passed button as a parameter, get its 'tag' and process it as needed. Edit: on re-reading the problem, the above lets you have a single handler for all five buttons. To do the button highlight logic you'd want an array of references to each button (you can load that up in your viewDidLoad method). Then on each tap loop through and unhighlight all of them and then highhlight the one that was tapped. As an optimization you can track only the current highlighted one then toggle that one off, the new one on, and save the new one as the currently highlighted one. For this you can either use tags or just the button reference that is passed as the handler parameter.
&gt; You'll eventually need a ui element that is difficult or impossible to achieve with storyboard alone. Do you have any examples of this in mind?
For something like the slide out menu I think having a hard coded width is ok. Depending on how you want the design to look you could calculate a percentage of the device’s screen width, but I think the hard-coded to 200 is not a problem. Might change if you are trying to support both phones and tablets- in that case you could have a hard coded value for each type, or go with the percentage approach. 
No
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller
Never say never. But, for reference, on just iOS 11 phones, that can run from ~1/3 to 1/6 of the screen. You'll be covering quite a bit in one case, and not much at all in the other. If that's your design, great.
Am I too late? The link expired :(
In general, a protocol is a group of functions which something must implement if it wants to adopt a given protocol. A class is a full blown group of properties, functions, etc. UIButton, UIViewController, UITextField, etc, are all classes. UITextFieldDelegate is the delegate for UITextFields and declares functions that need to be implemented by your View Controller (or whatever handles canceling a text field or responding to value changes of that text field, etc). I don't know if that helps at all, but the word delegate should be in any delegate protocol like UITextFieldDelegate, so native-to-apple code will always (?) follow that, which should be your key on whether it's a class or protocol. Obviously, nothing is ever "always", so grain of salt and all that, but should be a helpful marker for sure. 
Be able to do both. I'd consider knowing how to make an app with purely programmatic views necessary for getting a job.
And to add to this if you can fit all of your content into it then that’s fine. The main bonus in bigger screens is to have more content. Zooming up controls to scale to bigger phones to use up the space for the sake of it is weird (the iOS display settings cover that if the user wants )
Storyboards are an issue everyone has their own opinion on. I don't think there are really best practices for SBs other than separating them as often as possible. I kinda like having the IB show what I'll later see within the app, but as I said, this depends on your preference.
What is your end goal here? You can do this with Mapbox or any iOS mapping SDK 
I want to implement this into Mapbox. Right now it works fine in the Map Kit View but I want to replace the Map Kit with a Mapbox but if I do that I would need to change the code. So my question is what do I add/delete/replace to make it work in Mapbox instead of the Map Kit.
Read the docs.
Maybe it's because I'm on mobile, but your code got formatted really weird.
What have you tried thus far?
Hard coding is fine in this case, as long as you don’t have text in it that may grow if localized or when large fonts are enabled. 
I have tried replacing all the MK... with MGL... I thought it would work but when I got to MKCoordinateRegion it failed since there is no MGLCoordinateRegion. That's really it since I'm new to programming and I did not want to mess up a lot more than I already had.
Yeah, it looks better on desktop. 
You're going to want to present another ViewController containing an ImageView. You'll either set the image or pass it in prior to presentation. Using PresentAnimators you can make this look pretty slick, but that'll be the harder implementation. If you add the ImageView to a scroll view, you get pan and zoom for free.
Hey. Thank you for the offer. I will look at the free one in the meantime. 
&gt; ARKit is actually fairly straight forward I actually agree with this. It is much easier to create AR apps with ARKit than anything else. Just to show how much effort Apple had put in to be able to see great AR apps from iOS developers.
DM me too. We can work on a project via GitHub or something. :)
Link has expired.
Expired for me as well.
You should start by reading the MGL documentation/overview - how does their API seem to compare to MapKit on a high level? You need to be able to answer that question before you start changing code.
Greetings! Your idea of establishing a grid of squares and specifying the type of terrain at each coordinate (eg a1, b1, ...) is pretty common in game dev. Most devs working on a game like this will use some sort of map editor, usually leaving the hard-coded map construction around only during early stages of development. Apple also has SceneKit which might be helpful for laying our your maps/scenes I’d spend some time researching SpriteKit and 2d maps. There are some great examples of how people do this in a variety of languages. Honestly, you’d probably gain some interesting design/architecture/name ideas by watching someone like quill18creates on YouTube do stuff in unity A really common 2d map editor is called Tiled (it’s really good), there seems to be a maintained SpriteKit library here: https://github.com/mfessenden/SKTiled
Not sure what you mean by "control", but I've written a game controller framework that supports iOS, tvOS and macOS. It makes it easy to send values in any direction (the underlying networking is based on NSStream), including from Mac to iOS. It's optimized for sending the kind of numerical values associated with game controller elements (like a button, thumbtack or dpad) but it can also send strings and NSData. It allows for sending data in both directions. https://github.com/robreuss/VirtualGameController If you happen not to like my beautiful framework, an alternative is Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity 
This is too vague to answer. I'm not even sure what #1 and #2 have to do with each other. Asset resolution and outlets and layering are all pretty orthogonal.
The title is best practice !!! Then , as i am an android developer with 1 year experience : -It not vague in android development as i usung shape xml as abackground in my custom view And there is aseparation of concerns The xml is for design ... The (java | kotlin) is for programming. -But its very vague in ios development there is no best practice There is no tutorials design the view controllers which explains the best practice Some of them using the pics as backgrounds And the others using the swift.
OK so deinit is not called on the UICollectionViewFlowLayout. How do I remove the strong reference between the flow layout and the cells?
interface builder xib files - yes storyboards - no I don't see the value in having the flow in a storyboards, I would much rather handle it in code (using navigation controller or modal vc). It's much clearer for me. I use xibs to design separate view controllers - it's obviously more visual and less code.
Ok I will thank you
I recommend zeplin.io for extracting colors and style guide directly into Xcode (as of version 9). Zeplin has a sketch plugin. 
I'm working on my first (second, about 70% through and abandonded a game) app for youtubers. So far i've got functioning app that does exactly what I want, but I want to fix up some things (my last words) before submitting it to the app store. It integrates with the YT api and is for subscriber milestones, viewer milestones, etc. I've learnt so much about swift and asynchronous tasks, networking, using the storyboard, etc. I've also generalised it so I could quite easily roll it out for other media streams.
Every project I've worked on in the last few years has used storyboards or been in the process of migrating to them.
Can you send an updated Discord link?
https://discord.gg/j6c5Jdh
You can combine them by setting proper priority for the constraints. Like maybe you want your menu to be at least 180 points wide but you also want it to be exactly 1/2 the width of the phone (but with lower priority, so small phones will still have that 180 point width)
How does the entity-component structure of SpriteKit/scenekit/gameplaykit work compared to how it is implemented in Unity? That's the biggest barrier I have come up against trying to play with SpriteKit and SceneKit myself: how do you structure the gameplay logic and behavior of entities within the scene if you can't directly attach components to SKNode or SCNNode? GKEntity and GKComponent are great, but what good does it do to have two disconnected scene trees of entities and components?
Try using an intermediate type to wrap the relevant key. For example: import Foundation let json = """ { "irrelevant_key" : "irrelevant_value", "relevant_key" : { "property_1": "value1", "property_2": "value2", "property_3": "value3" } } """.data(using: .utf8)! struct MyStruct: Decodable { let property_1: String let property_2: String let property_3: String } struct MyStructContainer: Decodable { let relevant_key: MyStruct } let myInstance = (try JSONDecoder().decode(MyStructContainer.self, from: json)).relevant_key print(myInstance) // Prints an instance of MyStruct This is essentially the technique described on the 3rd page of this playground: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/using_json_with_custom_types
Not OP, but I think I can answer some of those questions. Not sure about SceneKit, but in the SpriteKit editor, you *can* attach components to nodes. When you load the .sks file as a GKScene, it creates entities for the nodes, and then adds your components to those entities, along with a GKSKNodeComponent to connect the component back to the node in the SKScene. You can expose properties of your components to the .sks editor interface using the @GKInspectable directive. In other words, if you think of your nodes as your entities, then you can work with the .sks scene editor much in the same way as you would Unity with its component system. (The .sks editor is not nearly as feature-rich as Unity's editor, of course.)
Do you have the mapView in your class hooked up via Interface Builder?
Is there anything that could cause conflict with the import? For example is your project called MapKit?
That's very helpful, thanks! Maybe you have an answer to another question: What about sending messages between entities? I know GKComponentSystem can be used to update all components of a certain class regardless of what entity they are attached to, but what parent/child relationships between entities, and communication between entities? For example, if I had a battleship game I might want to model each turret as its own entity, with agent components to handle aiming and shooting. If a shell hit one of these turrets however, it would be important to alert the parent node, the ship, that it has taken damage so hit points can be deducted and so the UI can update to alert the user that the turret has taken damage.
Well, there are several approaches. Probably the best way would be to have your components just send out NSNotifications via NSNotificationCenter. That way, your components are completely decoupled from the scene around them, and you are using the method that the OS intends for such communication. There are other things you could do: * You could traverse up the node hierarchy from the turret, looking for a node of the needed SKNode subclass that represents the ship. Once you find it, you'd grab the component reference for that node and call the needed method in it. * You could expose the name of the needed component with @GKInspectable, and find the needed node that way, by doing a name search. * You could put all of your turret controllers on your ship model - turret controllers - and have them communicate with the needed models for the animation stuff. That way, everything is all in one conceptual component - the SKNode that acts as the parent for all of the ship's models - and the components drive the action on the models, not in individual nodes. * You could, at startup, search for the correct components in the tree and keep weak references to them to message directly. * You could have a centralized turret manager that all turrets talk to. Then your ships talk to the turret manager. Or you could have a ship manager the turrets talk to. You can probably think up more alternatives, too. But all of these suffer from pretty tight coupling that could cause trouble down the road. The NSNotification approach, I think, is the most generalizable and "clean" way to do it, though, and is what I'd recommend if you don't have a really compelling reason to do one of the other approaches. It's hard to go wrong with properly decoupled code. 
I don't think that would actually throw an 'undeclared type' error. Shouldn't it logically throw an error saying the outlet is not connected or that the value is nil? Sorry if I am wrong I rarely use storyboards.
I used Rx with Mapbox a few years ago. [Here](https://gist.github.com/ChrisLowe-Takor/9e6b7f1d519b62d466f8) is the gist. You can take the idea and apply it to the MkDelegate. I found it useful because I had some advanced use cases for things like firing web requests when the map stops moving (amongst other things). Throttling, Debouncing and Zipping streams cut out a lot of statefulness and member variables you need to have without observables. Like you, I also used Rx for the CLLocationManagerDelegate. The pros was some self contained and concise code. Like you say, if you aren't familiar with Rx then it can be harder to read and debug. Another con was handling the lifecycle of the observables was tougher than I anticipated and I ended up with a lot of retain cycles and `viewDidAppear` nuances I wasn't expecting. I'd use Rx for this again but only if it was absolutely necessary to cut out complexity like it was for my use case. I wouldn't recommend it for simple mapping apps or just because you want everything to be Reactive.
I was hoping there was an event bubbling mechanism, like the responder chain. That wouldn't be very difficult to add to a custom SKNode subclass, would it?
How would you go about creating this pumpkin if it was on an iPhone Interface?
How do you choose?
You mean, bubbling up the SKScene structure? I'm not aware of something like that already in place, but you can probably add that with an SKNode extension without too much trouble. Since GKEntities don't have a concept of parents / children and are managed as just a bag full of entities, there's no hierarchical structure to them by themselves to "bubble up" through, but the SKScene can provide one. From a component, you could pop out to the SKScene structure and start traversing up the node tree, checking for entities associated with the nodes and messaging the relevant entity and component in each level until you have reached an SKScene object. You might also look into GKComponentSystem. That might give you what you need. It's not a "bubbling" system, but depending on what you're doing, it could serve the given purpose.
Where is this resource? Is it a book in the iBooks appv
[map](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2908681-map)
Thanks. I thought this might be what i wanted, but I wasn’t sure—still learning the Swift ecosystem. I’ll do some reading.
thanks!
Maybe it’s possible but annoying to implement. I have a UITableView and wanted to add a custom view on top of everything. Trying to do it on storyboard (if I remember) would automatically add it as a header or footer. I know it didn’t add it freely on top. It was easier to do it in code. Especially since I wanted to present it as a specific point. 
I mean, this is more unique than the truckload of swift books already available.
It definitely would surprise me, as the `...Layout` classes don't interact with cells directly at all? They "just" generate layout attributes.
You've shown the memory graph for the controller and the cell; however, the graph for the collection view itself would be interesting also. It's possible that the controller is deallocated, but it's view is still somewhere in a view hierarchy, so the collection view and it's cells remain visible (and are therefore not deallocated). I'm pretty sure that you actually need to figure out why your collection view is not deallocated. Maybe it's because you just remove the child controller, but the child controller's view remains in the hierarchy. To clarify, have a look at this: https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Adding-and-Removing-Child-View-Controllers. I suspect you may be missing the `yourViewController.view.removeFromSuperview()` line in the "Removing a child view controller" example?
I’m fairly new to iOS development as well (3 months in now). If you’re up for it you can add me on skype so that we can learn together. I’m pretty sure it would be useful to us both. Let me know if you’re interested and I’ll PM you my skype ID.

Firebase doesn’t use arrays; it uses dictionaries. 
Did it work? Firebase uses dictionaries. It’s photoURL[“0”] since the numbers are actually keys. 
[removed]
This converts the integer keys of a dictionary into an array of strings, which I believe is what you asked for. Note: dictionary keys are unordered, so the resulting array is unordered too. let numbers = [1: "Hello", 2: "Hello", 3: "Hello", 4: "Hello", 5: "Hello"] let strings = numbers.keys.map { String($0) }
My team uses Storyboards – it's just very easy for new developers to absorb the UI and make small changes. We do separate our Storyboards so that each one only captures on Module (e.g., Login is handled by one Storyboard, Dashboard by another, etc.). We also define all of our modular views as .xibs, such as UITableViewCells. One thing that I can't stress enough is that Storyboards are great for sitting with UX Designers. It's much easier to review a design, make small changes, and talk about the designs when you have something like a Storyboard in front of you. I would be happy to use programmatic views in a personal project but for that reason alone I think it's important to err towards Storyboards and NIB files.
Starting my university iOS development project. Unsure what I'm going to do yet - just getting used to XCode and Swift :) 
hey, took a while, but finally got around to it! https://www.vaporforums.io/thread/25
No not that I know of but I just switched everything over to Mapbox instead and the error is gone so it must be an error within the MapKit framework... at least that is my guess.
So you follow a book in the iBooks app, but you download a folder for the exercises. The problem is Apple doesn’t show the answers to the problem or the original problem, and I have no idea how to reset Xcode to get the original problem back.
Oh awesome! I was just thinking about working on this yesterday too. Thanks for the hard work
The Index shows some strange anomalies, the moment when swift where introduced, objective-c tanked from place 3 to 10 (without significant gains to swift) tiobe explained that this means that devs switched to c++ (which would be rather strange)
These popularity indexes report results to 1/1000th of 1%, yet there's no consistency or reproducibility or even complete methodology to warrant such precision. I can define a person's height and weight in much more concrete and reproducible terms, but I'd never report my height and weight to 5 significant figures, because it would be hilariously absurd. Elsewhere they admit that the TIOBE index is merely a measure of search engine popularity, not quality or use, yet the author of this piece seems to be trying really hard to spin it into one of those. The author doesn't seem to have any experience writing real software, either. They claim it got passed by Scratch, too, for example. Why not claim that watchOS developers are abandoning Apple Watch for Scratch workbooks? You can invent any conclusions you want from a simple list of numbers, if you don't do any research to investigate the actual reasons for it.
I just have a hard time accepting Javascript for app development.
I prefer using ObjC until Swift becomes ABI stable.
You can’t write shaders with Swift currently, as far as I know. I’d recommend checking out Metal. It’s apples shader language. It’s written using a subset of C++14 and has some similarities to GLSL. There are some tutorials out there for talking to Metal using Swift; I think Ray had one?
Thanks for the reply. I'm aware that you don't actually write the shaders in swift. I was just hoping to use a swift environment to link to the shaders. I was looking at the wenderlich tutorials on scenekit - I'll probably give that a shot. The thing is I already have shader code in GLSL, so I was hoping to reuse that. According to the apple documentation, I can use SCNShadable to write custom shaders. This documentation also mentions using shader modifiers written in Metal or GLSL. I'd ideally like to see examples of using a shader modifier written in GLSL with scenekit. 
After doing some more research - it seems like spritekit might be a better option than scenekit for doing fragment shaders. It would allow me to use standard GLSL fragment shaders.
I’m speaking at a conference in Amsterdam this November (FHIR DevDays) on a framework I’ve written called FireKit. It’s a bridge framework that provides a Realm-ready suite of FHIR DSTU2 compliant classes for modelling anything healthcare related. I recently finished porting it to Swift 4, during which I made it fully Codable compliant. As part of this I also created Restivus, a Swift 4 protocol-based REST library. Restivus is based on a pattern I developed while working on another project, and it was working out pretty damn well. So I decoupled it from he domain, expanded it, and open sourced it. FHIR allows you to focus on the healthcare application instead of the model/database. Restivus allows you to focus on the structure of the request/response instead of all the networking plumbing. I’ve recently started developing a small sample app that brings these two things together and they play very nicely together (hooray for Codables!) FireKit at https://github.com/ryanbaldwin/FireKit (warning: I need to write a proper novel of documentation). Restivus at https://ryanbaldwin.github.io/Restivus (Jazzy docs are there with 100% coverage, along with a small how-to... still need to make a bigger How To that’s more encompassing) Restivus can be used in any domain. FireKit is for FHIR (Dstu2) based apps. Cheers!
You’ve done a lot of great work on that library. We started to use it for a prominent feature in our app but, sadly, had to pump the feature down the road in favour of higher priority features. We will be using JTCalendar when we get back to it though. Keep up the great work!
Lack of ABI stability is a pain point, but Swift syntax is so much terser than ObjC that I tend to prefer it over ObjC now. Also, Xcode 9 finally makes Swift a first class citizen, which helps since the toolkit is finally complete. Working with C libs is much more of a pain under Swift. However, the reality is that Apple is making the switch whether we like it or not and ObjC will eventually go the way of Carbon. I’m not saying this is the right decision, but it’s the choice they made.
IMHO Javascript is a very bad programming language. But not for the reasons people think it is bad. The problem with Javascript is it's being recommended as a programming language to start coding and it's not. It really isn't. They recommend it because it has a big community and it's very easy to see the payoff of learning it, but Javascript is a language for advanced people. An asynchronous and weakly typed language as an introduction to coding? Hell no. That being said, 99% of the problems you see in Javascript would be avoided using TDD and understanding how Javascript works (which is not easy for a beginner).
Hi, thanks for your reply. I had been adding/removing as written in that guide, however your answer lead me to a solution! I added self.collectionView = nil to the deinit of the UICollectionViewController, and now all the cells and it's FlowLayout deinitialise as well! Thinking about how the View Controller is a separate object from the CollectionView really helped. Thank you very much :)
The domain was registered exactly 2 months ago today. It says it's owned by "Beta Particle", but betaparticle.io simply points to the same webpage. I can only find one name attached to any of these, in a business filing in California (as a Delaware company: common with small startups trying to save every last penny, because it's super cheap and has no residency requirement). They have a Twitter account with no tweets, and a StackOverflow account with no questions or answers. I can find no record of them in any startup accelerator or other external funding source. I agree their webpage makes it look like they're trying to be completely anonymous, which is not a god sign. I'm surprised they're hiring at this stage. It looks like a self-funded startup. I hope you asked lots of questions about their financial situation, and if you accept, I hope you get paid for your work.
Continuing improvements to my SMS spam filter app, [SmartFilter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartfilter-for-messages/id1271258894?mt=8). Looking to tweak the CoreML model and add a few more features: more filter customization and some perks for people who leave a tip via IAP.
&gt; Obviously I want the path of the file to be relative to the executable's directory Is this a typo? Most programs do not work this way. If I type "ls *.c", I probably want all the files that end in ".c" in my current working directory, not in /bin. Paths are relative to the working directory by default. What does your source code look like? &gt; I know groups correspond to directories in the project structure How do you mean? I don't think I understand this.
Dang, awesome sleuthing! I dropped the whole thing feeling like something was wrong but couldn't confirm it. Thanks again; your promotion to detective is happening. There are a few typos and some grammar problems on the site. I just couldn't shake the sense that something is wrong with this picture.
A closure is a function. That’s a return statement inside a function.
You can have one return per function (or computed property getter) or closure, and this line happens to have a computed property getter that returns something (the `var selectedOption: [URL]? { return something }` part) and a call to flatMap with a closure, that also returns something (the `allSelectedOptions.flatMap({ return $0.customPart })` part). I guess `flatMap` is the confusing part? If you call it on an array, it basically say "do something with each element in the array, but discard the things that become nil" - in this case "get the customPart property of each element, but throw out the ones that are nil". (There are other versions of flatMap, but that one is the most common I think - might be a different one in your case. The whole line returns all `customPart`s of `allSelectedOptions` that are not nil. Note: the `return` in the closure isn't necessary. This is the same as `private var selectedOptions: [URL]? { return self.allSelectedOptions.flatMap { $0.customPart }}`.
Let’s start with “map”, then move up to “flatMap”. Okay, “map” is a method to transform a sequence. It takes a function, and applies that function to each element of the sequence, thus producing a new sequence whose elements are the result of transforming each element of the original sequence. The function you pass to “map” must take as input one element of the original sequence, and return as output the corresponding element of the new sequence. Does that make sense? If not, stop here and read more about functions and closures in The Swift Programming Language. ***** Now “flatMap” is very similar to “map”, but it works on a sequence \*of sequences\*. It acts like you called “map” on \*each sequence\*, and then concatenate the result. You still pass in a function which transforms elements, and “flatMap” applies that function to each element of each of the sequences. So you end up with one long array where the first several elements are the transformed results of the first sequence, followed by the transformed results of the second sequence, and so forth. There are a couple other versions of “flatMap” which treat Optionals as if they were sequences (empty if nil, one element if not), with very similar behavior.
&gt;&gt;Is this a typo? Nah. I guess maybe I just misunderstand filepaths in general, or better yet, lots of experimenting with it lead me to believe, for some reason or another, the library API used absolute paths. I don't know really. I got a little bit more familiar with the URL struct and Xcode, and I think I figured out why the file wasn't being found in the first place. Turns out I probably forgot to add a file copy step in the build profile, and the image.pbm never got copied into the target build. tl;dr I forgot to add the input data to the copy-file build step, that was probably the reason. I'll test it when I get on my computer, but the code is [here](https://github.com/bzimmermandev/maze).
The service itself is that you can write swift code combined with HTML/CSS. I actually talked to one of their guys about a position as an iOS Developer. Had a short talk which was followed by a coding challenge a couple of weeks later. They gave me 1 week to finish it but I completed it in 3 hours and sent it in. Their challenge was not hard, it was literally following the directions on how to make a web page based on their guides. No response afterwards even after following up twice. It sucks not knowing why you got rejected... even a generic email telling me that they will not move on would have been nice.
This is really great. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
Can you just download the exercises again?
You're welcome! Let me know if you put it to use!
Thank you very much. If there any feature or update you need, do let me know. Always looking for ways to improve it.
// if you cast your array as type any you can convert easier let numbers: [AnyHashable: String] = [1: "Hello", 2: "Hello", 3: "Hello", 4: "Hello", 5: "Hello"] for num in numbers.keys { let temp = String(describing:num) } does this help any? 
I'm pretty new to swift so I would do something like this... is this a good solution or no? let numbers: [AnyHashable: String] = [1: "Hello", 2: "Hello", 3: "Hello", 4: "Hello", 5: "Hello"] for num in numbers.keys { let temp = String(describing:num) }
Maybe, would I then delete everything except the file I needed?
Might be best to keep a clean backup of the downloaded files, just in case this happens again, but yeah just overwrite the file(s) you need. Can you give me a link to this book/files, I kinda want to check them out myself.
This looks really cool, 5 minutes into reading and I really want to convince my boss to use this
Might be handy to have since it can’t be reset I guess. See if that links work, if not download Intro to App Development With Swift on the iBook store and you can get to it with a link on page V of the introduction. Let me know if that works for you and if you figure anything out! https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/swift/downloads/Intro-to-App-Development-Curriculum-Swift4.zip 
I mean, there's nothing technically "wrong" with it, as long as you know exactly what you're getting into. Depending on your life situation, it could be perfectly reasonable to take a chance on it for 2 weeks. If he flakes and you don't get a paycheck, then be prepared to walk away. Just don't go in expecting a nice office, or an experienced team with a PM, or a CI server running unit tests. You're probably going to be employee #1, and fixing the grammar on the webpage could well be part of your job, at this stage.
You have to pass those values in the function you use to upload data to Firebase. I do something like "likes": 0, "comments": 0. Whenever I upload a post it uploads with the name, time, caption, likes, comments, etc. You then need to have a function somewhere that updates the count of likes/comments (the node) in Firebase. 
Nice work ! It opens a world of possibilities.
&gt; // Drops all the elements less than 15 &gt; array.drop { $0 &lt; 15 } // ArraySlice&lt;Int&gt;[100, 46, 99] This isn't accurate. The function you're calling is `drop(while:)` and it only drops elements at the start of the array that satisfy the condition. To get the behavior of the comment, you need `filter` (but it returns `Array`, not `ArraySlice`). Other than that, it's worth pointing out that Swift 4's `Substring` is to `String` what `ArraySlice` is to `Array`.
Thanks man! If you give it a whirl and find something that’s weird lemme know. I’ve found that it being protocol oriented allows you to easily set a lot of defaults via protocol extensions (such as the “baseUrl”), but still have the flexibility of customizing a single request, without having to go down the traditional road to inheritance hell, If there’s any questions feel free to post an issue in github and I’ll answer. The how-to is enough to get a person started but is still pretty incomplete, so it’s unlikely to cover everything. 
I use the GITEX (Github Index) to check language popularity in repos and JS is clearly on top followed by Python.
I like to keep the likes separated in the database. Then use a Firebase Cloud Function to modify e.g. a property called `like_count` each time a new like was created. In your case, the structure could looks like: users: { $userId: { username: "FromDerik", ... }, ... } posts: { $postId: { creatorUserId: $userId, like_count: 12, title: "Some title", ... }, ... }, likes: { $postId: { $userId: true, ... }, ... }
Thanks!
You also want to keep the users uid under each post. If you only save the username, it will be difficult to find the user object from the post.
Hi jamieooo! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that. If the content you were submitting *was* in fact related to the subject of Swift programming, please [message the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswift&amp;subject=Please%20review%20my%20removed%20App%20Store%20submission&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/75hvn0/stuck_on_learning_structures/) to have it reviewed.

This is what I was going to recommend. It's the most flexible in case you want to add information to the like, beyond just a count or the user's id who liked it. Doing it this way would allow you to add a timestamp, type of like (thumbs up, heart, etc.), or anything else you think of down the line. Incoming: shameless plug Complications like these when mapping your native data mode to a structure that Firebase likes is what drove me to create Stackberry, a similar Backend-as-a-Service built for Swift apps. With Stackberry, your native class definitions ARE your backend data model, there's no translation or serialization. If you can figure out how to model your data in Swift then you're done. Apologies for the plug, but thought it might be relevant
You could move the player to some kind of manager you start when you init your tabbar or something, or maybe try force the tabbar to load the second tab in some manner ? As far as trying to do it on the background, as far as I remember the AVPlayer already sets the item internally on a background thread
Interviews with them but it was very weird, like a lady in a call center was reading questions and she specifically only reacted to certain buzzwords in my replies. They then sent me a coding challenge and but decided not to do it after reviewing the job description a second time. 
And I’m in the US not Madrid 
I'm pretty certain that Madrid is the name of the library, not a location.
Yeah, a [little digging](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6761201?start=0&amp;tstart=0) suggests that Madrid is a library involved in iCloud and AppleID sync things.
Try this: [XcodeWarnings](https://github.com/jonreid/XcodeWarnings) You can edit in or out the warnings you want to see. You can even have several Xcode configuration files for different stages of development. Here's an article that discusses the use of the files: [Xcode Warnings: Can You Turn Them Up to Eleven?](https://qualitycoding.org/xcode-warnings/)
I wonder why there is only index(where: (Element) -&gt; Bool) And no: index(from: Int, where : (Element) -&gt; Bool) To look for an element index starting from an given index. Without this method, you have to get an ArraySlice first, then call index on the ArraySlice. This force you to make an ArraySlice in your own code and likely causing you to hold on to it, which is not good for memory. With the second one nodes method, the ArraySlice can be created inside the method, lookup and return the index, releasing ArraySlice once the method returns. 
I did the exact same. Until I see otherwise, I am assuming they are are a weird scam or something. 
It happens. I've used this extension and others like it successfully. You may have to play around with it. Search Git and Google for image orientation extensions and you'll see posts and repositories with others having the same issue. https://gist.github.com/schickling/b5d86cb070130f80bb40
The method should be called: dropFirst(...) Then there is no ambiguity
Thanks, although the problem is not in the image resizing function, it is in the line `let image = attachement.image(forBounds: attachement.bounds, textContainer: NSTextContainer(), characterIndex: range.location)!` I think it has something to do with the `attachement.bounds ` but am not sure If I dont process the image at all and just set the NSTextAttachment to `image` from above, it still gets flipped 
Welcome to opinion land, here's mine: Probably. The information you need is available for free, or for a few hundred bucks if you buy more books than you're likely to read. People are shockingly helpful if you're polite and self driven, and do a little basic searching first. If you're NOT self driven, and won't learn without structure and whip cracking...then...maybe it's worth it? But there's a glut of bootcamp graduates right now, and the general consensus is that they know way less than they think they do. If I had the option to hire a bootcamp grad, or someone who's self taught and has a project or three under their belt, maybe some bug fix submissions to open source projects....I'd take the self starter. The bulk of real world programming is not particularly glamorous, and not as complicated as many folks make it out to be. Find a thing that interests you and tear it apart, or build a clone. You'll learn a LOT of real world useful skills. If you can collaborate, communicate, and work on projects with others well...that's the good stuff. Having said that...many software developer interviews will ask you questions about algorithms and wrote memorization data that you either will rarely if ever need to know, or could look up in 5 minutes if you had a connection to the internet...which you PRETTY much always have. So getting your foot in the door at the first job is your hardest step. Once you've had one gig, assuming you do well, you'll not lack for offers of employment from people you've worked with who have themselves moved on to other companies. That's one place the boot camp _may_ help out if they have any form of job placement assistance/guarantees.
I figured it out and it was so much simpler than I was making it. Because the image was in a NSAttribuetdString being appended into a NSTextView I didn't need to resize each image in the NSAttributedString, rather I just had to set the attachment scaling inside the NSTextView with `markdown.layoutManager?.defaultAttachmentScaling = NSImageScaling.scaleProportionallyDown`. One line is all it took
You can include the label by not using the trailing closure syntax.
I dont see the issue with `array.dropFirst(5).index(where: { $0.something })`
As to the point about the standard algorithms used in interviews, you can do the free mini-course associated with the book Cracking the Coding Interview on the site [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview). Most of the tasks in that course are available in Swift, so you can play along with their test cases (though I did use C for some that weren’t at the time available in Swift.) I used those to brush up on those standard algorithms before a coding interview with Amazon, and nailed all of the coding stuff. Literally every question they asked for coding tests was from that material. I very much didn’t do well on the interview questions where I was expected to not roll my eyes or say “for fuck’s sake” when talking to them; your mileage may vary. On the other hand, I have a friend who did one of those boot camp style courses, and he has a job in the field after completing it. He’s working with Node.js, which sounds like hell to me, and frankly I don’t think the code he writes is any good, but he is gainfully employed. Like the commenter to whom I’m responding, I would likely hire a self motivated amateur who applied the skills learned from coding test sites and YouTube videos to various interesting projects (especially if I can see it on Github) than one who came out of those programs. 
I ended up forcing the AVPlayer view controller to load by switching to that tab in my app delegate when the app launches, then immediately switching back to my default view controller at the end of the AVPlayerViewController's viewDidLoad(). It doesn't seem to take any longer to get to my default view from the beginning of app launch, and accomplishes what I'm trying to do. I did not look very far into multi-threading, but from what I've read it's not recommended to do that with AVFoundation.
Thanks- any idea about electric touch? Can’t find anything 
Honestly the reason I’m interested is because my phone produced a slight electric shock when touching the home button around the metal. So I’m wondering if Apple is complacent in the risk 
Not all boot camps are a sham. I taught at one and I’m proud of all of my students. Some worked harder than others, and all of them deserve everything they worked hard for. No boot camp can guarantee that you will get a tech job. Jobs don’t work like that and neither do boot camps. They give you access to materials and instructors who can help explain it when you don’t get it. When you are done they can send your resume to recruiters that they know hire their grads, and hope you do well enough to get that first job that leads to others. If you can self learn the skills you need in 12 weeks, then you don’t need a boot camp, and that doesn’t mean that a boot camp is pointless or a sham, just that some people don’t need/want one. If a boot camp takes money from people and then hands them a book and never holds a class or simply vanishes then that boot camp is a sham. The Iron Yard was a good one, but it’s gone now. 
I attended Aaron Hillegas' Big Nerd Ranch Objective-C bootcamp (many years ago, back when Aaron was teaching it). It's difficult to assess the value objectively, but to me it was cheaper back then and was valuable for my needs. If you were taking the Objective-C bootcamp, I would not consider it unless you knew plain C programming very well already. Do you know about memory management, pointers, and arrays at pretty solid level? How familiar are you with pointers-to-pointers (aka handles)? If you don't know these concepts already, you'll find the info you have to master significant before you really get into what the instructors are talking about. If you were thinking of taking the Swift boot camp from BNR, evaluate your skills before you take it. Try and get through their Intro to Swift Programming book (2nd edition) if you haven't done so already. Do you understand it? Can you follow the examples using tools like Xcode and Interface Builder? As a bonus, can you use tools like Git or Terminal without being hand held through them? If so, then I'd say you're probably a good candidate for their course on iOS Programming. You know the language reasonably well and you know how to use the most common tools. So why bother taking their iOS Programming Course rather than simply read their book? You'd save a LOT of money. Okay, then try the book ($45 or so). You'll find that it talks a lot about patterns in Apple's libraries. You'll be able to ask experts to help you get your head around things that aren't always clear in Apple's documentation. The handholding you'll get from the instructors is material that really is better when being mentored one-on-one. Will you get a job from taking the course? I wasn't looking for a job when I took my course (I was trying to educate myself to start my own business). My guess is that most of the people looking to hire bootcamp graduates are looking for intern-level people to help out. In those cases, you'll likely need to relocate and work on-site with the company. If you want to get more attention, make your own apps. Get them in the store. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. If I were spending my bootcamp money today, I'd try the cheap courses first. I'd have a hard time spending more than $2K on a course if I wasn't already convinced that the experts teaching it would be able to mentor me to a higher level. I wouldn't expect to go in starting at zero. IMHO, go in prepared but inexperienced to get the best outcome.
Hey thanks! I ended up using Rx for everything because it did simplify things (and likely still will as I add features). 
I don't have advice; just was reminded that I have hopes that the [Codable](https://medium.com/swiftly-swift/swift-4-decodable-beyond-the-basics-990cc48b7375) type was going to be the basis for ORM development in Swift. So far, they have only implemented JSON. Could Codable be used to move data in and out of Postgres?
I did read up on codable but the app I'm working on has been in development for over a year now and we're really tied to swift 3 still. Hoping for a migration talk sometime soon. I'll look into it more though, thanks!
write your own serverside scraper
Thanks. is it hard to it? 
The truth is that not everyone will benefit the same. When I was in college, we used to have some students cheat their way thru the lab. They would share code in projects then change the code so that a teacher would think they did the work. Others programmed before and so they don't need to know anything about loops, data types, database design, etc... There's so many factors involved that it's hard to give general rules. Being in a structured place where you focus on programming with others can be a good thing. I did a 1 week deal years ago and it was pretty good, but a company paid for it. Small class sizes can really help. I read a few write ups on these places. Some would only include students that passed in their stats. So they claim X% get jobs... but don't tell you that only some of the students were counted and the reason was that others weren't "passed" ... This can be valid as not everyone that wants to be a programmer, has the skills. One other thing about this is that the cost of running one of these is unreal. You see $10 ~ 20K going from you to them, but don't see all the rent, payroll, etc... That 10k would be 1K/week. That's not much above rent for SF. So they need maybe 10 just to pay all the bills. Does this give you 10K worth of education or is it just paying the bills? Could you get the same thing from a book?
It was apps for previous years, only last year had a playground requirement. Basically, to win, make a cool app, make sure you have an app or two in the App Store and otherwise it’s just luck.
While connected to the charger?
Nope. It sent a numbing sensation through my thumb
This year, you had to make a playground. It had to show good use of apple technologies and be creative. You also have to answer 3 essay questions. It isn’t extremely hard to win one but being young definitely helps. I won a scholarship and noticed that many of the people were young people. There is no age restriction as there was a 9 year old and a ~79 year old last year, although they officially say you need to be 13+. It is open to grade school, university, and STEM students. No one knows if the projects change each year, however many people do suspect that they will to level the playing field. You get around 1 month to work on it. 
Okay, this is good. 👍🏼
IMO if you are not self driven you won't make it as a developer. Note I have never attended a bootcamp, but a lot of bootcamp people at my work are QA Engineers. The code that most of them write is pretty bad even after working as QA doing UITests for a couple years. But every person is different. I have seen some of the QA engineers write clean code and hell some of them use the proper terminology for things that I have to refresh myself on what they are talking about because my development team for the most part doesn't use the proper CS terms for. If you decide to do these programs I would say that you really need to be driven enough with them to do your own projects on the side or at least try and fix some radars on open source projects. There is a flood of jr developers with bootcamp certs hitting the market and just having one doesn't amount to a lot from what I understand.
nice writeup
Hah nice. I’ve also created a [menu bar tracker](https://lukakerr.github.io/projects/crypticker.html) in swift, but built it a while ago
In every interview I’ve done, the boot camp kids stand out like a sore thumb. They don’t have any level of theoretical knowledge. That don’t seem to be able to solve real problems. They can do UI, but even that can be tough for them. I guess it depends on if you want to be a low paid code monkey, or a well paid engineer. 
What are you not just setting up the constraints once? why are you trying to update them? All the cells look the same on the way down :/ 
According to their website you need to 13+, registered as an apple developer, and be enrolled in a part-time of full time course and/or be a member of a STEM organisation. I also remember from when I was looking at it that there was a dedicated section for women STEM. Not sure whether that exists anymore as I don't see it on their website. Source: https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/
Thanks!
Why not encourage good software engineering practice? Just because it's simple doesn't mean everything should happen in the ViewController. Also why not use Codable seeing as this is Swift 4?
Do you have to make constraints programatically ? Your (simple) layout would be much much easier with autoLayout. Subclass UICollectionViewCell, insert elements, auto-layout them and voila. This could be done in 5 minutes.
Need to ensure image path is correct, usually in the same relative folder to the model. Or you can always fix the shader, when you convet dae to scn.
You could try something like https://gist.github.com/robert-joosen/2e9cdfd61ddc300ec0d8f6d19e5e7edb to fetch data of web pages (did not test this code) Puma : https://github.com/OpenKitten/Puma
Good questions. The plan is to break this tutorial into several parts since I felt I already introduced a lot of concepts in part 1 here. In part 2 when I'll add support for multiple currencies there will be structs/enums for storing types of currencies, multiple classes, to separate out business logic from the VC and possibly Codable if appropriate (for this part there was only 1 key so it seemed unnecessary).
Image path is correct. I can apply same image textures to other DAE files. 
Cool, makes sense. You can then give reasonings why you're moving certain code into new types, etc.
I can't speak for all of them but in general, yes. You cannot cram the knowledge to independently build apps in 12 weeks, you just can't. 12 weeks does get you some good fundamentals, and the ability to do some cookie cutter stuff, but the rest comes from experience and doing. Is it worth it for 10k? Absolutely not. You'd be better served with a few books, or a Udemy course (when they go on sale, which is always), and watching the free (but very fast paced) Standford iOS course on iTunes U. Also 40k is really low for software development. I made almost that driving the bug around fixing computers for geek squad when in college.

Really late response, but thank you! This should work.

awesome!
I would love some help if you know SceneKit. It has been 5 days since I am trying to solve that problem. 
[what does "searching a lot" mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/74ngsx/anyone_new_learners_of_swift_wanna_team_up/)
I've searched for a discord server that had objC around 4 times already (for the past 1 and half year) and only found servers that swift channels in it, never objC
r/apple has a discord server set up with a #dev channel and discussions. All are welcome to join: https://discord.gg/9YrQTMJ
I struggled with this recently as well. I would suggest converting the file to a SceneKit File within Xcode’s editor menu, it will play a lot nicer than a DAE.
It's true that there is a channel for devs, but what I'm searching is something that has its dedicated space, plus, a server that could evolve to accept other languages. Started with objC and Swift as these are "my personal" needs, but with the idea of growing the server to accommodate more languages as the users request them
iOS developers slack is where it’s at. 
Slack would be a possibility if I had found it before
You’ll join soon enough. Everyone is this thread ha told you there already is some place where all of us are. I’m personally not joining another discord server. But if you think you can do it. Have fun. 
I've joined the discord server, won't join also the slack though. But I'm gonna try to keep my server and maybe make something out of it :) If I can help others, I'm more than pleased to do so
There's no way these two things are related — if you've got defective hardware though, you should probably get that looked at/replaced.
It is good to see you using prepareForReuse. Suggestions: Add the circle to the view at the end of init. Move that view to the front too. Just for giggles, comment out the setNeedsUpdateConstraints() and perpareForReuse() and see what happens. Also, why are you attaching a gif? You should know that video was made for better compression of images.
I did. It is the same. Did not solve my problem :(
you're in /r/swift though
joined today after syntaxzak mentioning it
There isn't really any ambiguity. The name of the method actually being called is drop(while:). "While" unambiguously indicates that it's dropping while the predicate holds true.
Ah I see. Have you tried deleting that material altogether and adding in a fresh one? This has worked for me in the past. Also, are you sure the lighting model you want is Blinn?
Fresh one? It is a pre-designed 3D model that I need to add textures. I cannot redesign that model. I have no 3D modelling experience. 
If you look in the screenshot you provided, at the top right there is a section for Materials. These materials are the actual textures for your model. Try removing the one material you have there (it’s named material) by clicking the minus sign, then try adding another by clicking the plus sign. SceneKit can be very finicky with these textures, I’ve often found that removing a material/texture will solve the problem. Also when you add in the the new material, the lighting model will default to Blinn, so make sure you choose the correct one here.
Hi, I have been looking around for a tutorial/documentation to explain how I can implement “PresentAnimators” however have been unsuccessful in finding something to follow along with. Are you able to point me in the right direction or briefly explain for better understanding how the above objective can be achieved? Thanks in advance. 
I tried it so many times. I added my materials. I tried every possible lightning. No luck. Adding colors instead of materials working great. Images are the problem. 
Except ``drop(while:)`` is always called with trailing closure syntax, which doesn’t use the ``while`` label. Don’t you think it’s confusing to read? They can overload ``dropFirst(while:)`` with the existing ``dropFirst(_:)`` if wanted, can they not? What would ``take(while:)`` do?
I don't think it's confusing at all. In the functional programming world, it's always been understood that a filter drops out all elements not matching the predicate, and drop drops the head *n* element, and dropWhile drops the head elements matching the predicate. Drop is never confusing, since you know if it's a drop or a dropWhile by whether or not it has that trailing closure. You're suggesting changing a naming scheme that's pretty cemented in FP and originates with Haskell. I don't think many people are getting drop and filter confused. take(while:) would return the elements of the sequence while the predicate holds true, instead of dropping them. It's like the inverse of drop(while:).
This approach seems backwards. I've not seen a good and successful ORM that began as "I'm writing an ORM" -- or almost any library, for that matter. They begin as "I've written the same thing 3 times, so I'm going to abstract it". Building something fully top-down has got to be one of the most difficult tasks in all of software.
Thank god you spam all the subs with this uselessnessception.
don't forget to delete your comment like you did it last time in iOSProgramming :) And write to all great women developers who are mentioned in my article, that you called them "uselessnessception".
it's not about women, but nice try twisting it that way, ms spammer.
you know, I'm happy to have a personal hater :)
bullshit much?
Thorough. And I recognized quite a few of them! Not sure why this is being criticized the way it was. Thanks for sharing!
Thank you very much. Ill try it. 
As someone who has worked on a Turn-by-Turn navigation app for iOS: Why? We already have free turn-by-turn from both apple and google. 
Well that's kind of what I'm doing. I've written a bunch of the same database CRUD operations and there's a lot of redundant code. So I'm abstracting most of it to a base model class which will implement the mechanics of an ORM. Sorry I wasn't clear about where I currently was when I started this. I guess the question I really wanted to ask was: reflection, yay or nay? 
And Mapbox
This is unrelated but for your constraints I would recommend using [SnapKit](http://snapkit.io/) as it makes reading and writing constraints a lot easier. 
Can’t it just be “Awesome iOS Engineers?”
Thank you I am familiar with it, however I'm making it a point to build everything programmatically before I resort to a lot of third party libraries and storyboards, but I will definitely keep it in mind for next time!
How dare you try to highlight successful people who are a minority in the field in order to inspire others who may find the prospect of entering the area daunting. What a selfish person you are.
If you install Swift from Swift.org you should be able to write and run from the terminal
That first one is just sublime text with iterm2, which you can totally develop swift on. 
Thanks! Would I also be able to have console output, error underlining and stuff available? I'm also going to have a GUI so I'm kinda wondering how I'm going to tackle that switching back and forth, but oh well.
Awesome. Thank you. Would I be able to have error underlining, console output and the Interface Designer? Like, if I run the code that Xcode pops up from the background? 
I think you can get a linter for swift thst can run in sublime text or vscode. Console output can come through the terminal or via a built in console like in vscode. I don’t think it’s possible to get IB without running the app or Xcode. 
Well if you want all that I’d just suggest downloading Xcode and coding in there. You won’t get syntax highlighting in the Terminal unless you have a plug in or something (never really explored this idea). But the basic way it works is that you write the code with your preferred editor, compile the package with a `swift build` command and then execute the generated file. It could then output to the shell it was run from. But if you have a Mac available I’d just go ahead and start exploring Xcode if you’re interested in learning Swift. You can write command line apps with Swift from there that run in the console and can be compiled and run from a shell script or Terminal command 
Thanks! Let's say I have my interface down and I just want to launch the app from the terminal, see if my desired code works with the interface, and then continue coding again, would that be possible? So: * Code in terminal * Run app (see interface, test if code works * Close app * Continue coding In any case, thanks for the help.
Thank you! I'm already deving in XCode (learning Swift) but I miss the minimalist terminal interface I had when doing programming in Linux. What I'm looking for is this: So: * Code in terminal * Run app (see interface, test if code works * Close app * Continue coding
You can certainly get all of that done in terminal windows with Swift!
Yes, absolutely. If I understand correctly, you want to code in a windowed terminal, right? In order to get there, you can use the following tools: - Tilix: https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/ - vim: https://vim.sourceforge.io/ And install collor extensions for Tilix and a swift extension for vim. [Here](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/the-swift-programming-language-kick-start/29580) is a kick start I wrote for Swift in Arch based OSes. However, I run Ubuntu at the moment.
If you’re doing a full on iOS app, your work flow might be something like “Code in Sublime Text -&gt; open in Xcode to build to a simulator” I know there’s an xcodebuild command line tool, but I’d need to play with it more before I could recommend it. 
I've been experimenting with Swift on Linux since it supported Linux (v.2.2?). Nothing can stop you writing Swift program in console environment. I use CodeAnywhere and VS Code (Sublime would work too). I mostly use Swift for console and web apps, no GUI fancy stuffs. Because I just want to learn the language. However, if you want to write GUI or mobile apps, nothing is better than XCode.
It's a macOS app! Would that be the same?
Thanks man. All I want is to have the editor in a terminal. The Interface Designer and stuff I like, but not the editor.
You can use ‘open’ in terminal to launch a Mac app
Ah fair enough, good luck
 https://blog.prototypr.io/behind-the-magic-how-we-built-the-arkit-sudoku-solver-e586e5b685b0 
There was a recent article about this in the iOSProgramming subreddit, I didn’t look at it but it may help. I would personally just try rewriting the DLX algorithm in Swift. There are some doubly linked list implementations you could copy to start with
Just type `open` as a command? Sorry I don't know how the macOS terminal would work, because I'm wondering where I'd type that, seeing how I'm also typing the code in the terminal window.
You’d have a few terminals open, and you’d do “open /path/to/MyApp.app” or “open -a MyApp” in a different terminal than your editor is in. Use ‘man open’ to see all the details of the open command.
Can someone please tell me how to get my iterm and sublime to look like this. 
If you plan to use Interface Builder I would just stick with Xcode. AppCode is decent but has no interface builder equivalent, so you’ll have to jump back and forth. Autocomplete outside of Xcode is pretty much broken for everything. Ive tried Sublime Text, VS Code, and Emacs. If you want Vim, try out the XVim2 plugin for Xcode.
Ah i was trying to avoid that, simply because i dont know Swift yet. So its going to take me a bit of time to learn it well enough for something like that. Another thought i had is to simply write it in python. I wonder if i can export the sudoku solver along with a keras model for image detection? I've been digging around, but i'd love some opinions.
thanks man!
Where is the code that segues to your main screen controller?
Honestly once I have an interface down I'll spend most time writing code for the functionality anyway, so I'd love to spend that time in a nice iTerm + Vim window!
Nice, I totally understand. I haven’t tried any Vim plugins (I was looking for something more IDE like). Let me know if you find a Vim plug-in that works well (especially regarding code completions). I’ll have to give it a try!
Absolutely. This is a hell of a timesink, lmao, but I hope it'll be worth it.
There many great lists of iOS engineers to follow, but all of them contain mostly men... Because of diversity issue in the tech, not so many people know about the interesting Twitter accounts of women iOS engineers. And obviously not so many writers recommend them. That's why I made a list of awesome iOS ladies :)
Happy that you liked it!
yeah, definitely I made the biggest mistake of my life!
I learned a lot from the great engineers in the list and some of them I even know personally. 
You can create a bridge between C++ and Swift, using Objective-C++. Or you can try to use https://github.com/dropbox/djinni that generates the bridge for you.
Swinject probably
I've seen [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) used in VIPER-architected demos before. Haven't actually used it myself though.
I've used Swinject but had problems with circular dependency injection which in my experience is not completely avoidable when using some kind of presenter / view architecture. I found that in swift you don't actually have to write much code to achieve what dagger does in Android - but without a Framework. We have one AppComponent and SubComponents for each module.
Thanks, that's was I looking for.
I used Swinject but had issues with it so I ended up doing DI manually. It’s not that much added work. 
I've never used SpriteKit, but I googled for "SKScene" and the top of the SKScene docs say "To display a scene, you present it from an SKView object." Have you tried using an SKView?
I think what fresh_compiler was getting at is that this isn't a console window. You can make your Xcode background dark, and turn off all the toolbars and stuff, too.
I think it's the LOLcat CLT
I've used Swinject on a medium sized project and enjoyed using it. However I now just use this class on a large project (3000+ code source files) https://gist.github.com/FGoessler/2b7df61ab3fb81048de3 I didn't have any issues with Swinject, I just wasn't using everything in provided. I just wanted a clean way to abstract an interface and an implementation without the factory pattern.
I have started Playgrounds and been looking for a good book or two that will help me start creating projects (however basic), right away. 
Come over to /r/spritekit and I'll help you. :)
Why?
&gt; Would I be able to have error underlining, console output and the Interface Designer? Interface Builder? No. It's integrated into Xcode. If it were possible, other tools would have done this already.

I recently updated my game controller framework (https://github.com/robreuss/VirtualGameController) and now I'm moving on to support multiplayer, server-based functionality. The end result will be the ability to deploy games that offer multi-player functionality across the internet through the controller framework (which is designed to transfer data of any type, not just controller input but game state). The framework API for managing game controllers across the Internet will be exactly the same as doing it on a LAN, so it'll be easy to offer both in a game. I'm doing this using the Vapor server-side Swift framework along with Starscream, the WebSocket framework written in Swift. So far my testing suggests the performance in terms of latency/input lag will be very good. I'm very excited to be doing server-side Swift!
:thumbsup:
Simple way: just pass dependencies into your init functions. If you want some inversion of control, you could use default parameters, or I prefer for cleanliness to use convenience initializers. So your convenience initializer takes in no or minimal parameters, and just constructs dependencies to pass to the required init. In tests, you just call the required init and provided mocked dependencies for everything. If you need object scopes, a simple service locator class isn't too difficult to write yourself if all you need are singletons. For anything more complicated, you probably want to look at Swinject, Dip, or Cleanse
Have a similar class written for our own use case. It's fine if you don't have access to the implementation and only the interface, but since it relies on runtime configuration I was never really a fan. Just constructing the implementations at the source via convenience inits seemed much more safe, although there's certainly uses for the service locator (view controllers from storyboards is one I can think of)
I'm sorry I'm new to Swift... what exactly would you like me to do to clear up the code to better understand it?
I need the distraction free stuff. Just my code and that's it. But I guess XCode will work for the foreseeable future.
Yep thats just what I do. Whats the point of these frameworks anyway? they all look needlessly complicated and sketchy.
Big Nerd Ranch books are pretty good and the answers to the challenges is normally on their site in the forums section
https://projecteuler.net/
HackerRank.com
There are pretty valid uses for them! Scopes and modules are two things you generally get with them, which can be really nice. For situations where you don't have access to the init (storyboards), it can also be useful. One other scenario the dependency container becomes useful is when the implementation is provided from something external, i.e. a base class could call .resolve() on a configuration that was registered from some other framework inside an app that can't be imported into the base one. Of course, you can do this without a framework, but these are pretty well implemented to cover a lot of edge scenarios. Just different uses for different things.
No it’s not. This proposal is lame.
Are you serious? What makes it lame?
You can have one return *per code path* in a function, closure, etc. For example: func foo(test: Int) -&gt; Bool { switch test { case 0 : return true case 1 : return false case 2 : return true default: return false } Now you have four return statements in that function but they cover all the code paths so everything works. If you had a code path without a return then you would have an invalid function and the compiler will give you an error telling you so.
Treehouse maybe? 
codewars.com
Total iOS blueprint by Duc Tran is a series of 59 tutorial videos, each of which ends with a code challenge.
Treehouse 
leetcode.com is a great place if you're up for the challenge
Treehouse is great for Swift! Mimo/Swifty is great too, it’s cheaper but also only available as apps for iOS devices last time I checked
/u/twostraws the guy from hackingwithswift has a book with swift coding challenges and has a free quiz about swift on his website. Have not read the challenge book but the books i've read written by him are really good. The quizzes on his website are also fun to take.
RW have a nice collection of video courses: https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses 
Yeah, true. Didn't think that through all the way.
Worth noting that these challenges get pretty math intensive pretty quickly. 
Seconded, the challenges on this website are a lot more pleasant than on many other websites where you manually have to deal with the standard input.
The only way to really know network speed is to be actively downloading something, which means you would have to have a constant download while passively using an app, which kinda doesn't make sense and is a waste of user data if they are not on wifi?
I can recommend you We ❤ Swift's [Online Exercise Platform](https://www.weheartswift.com/online-exercises/). It's very cheap - $10/month, it's super fun &amp; interactive and it might be the best way for a newbie to learn Swift from scratch. You'll see :)
Thank you! I will check it out. 
Thanks, I'll check those out. Having it as an app would be nice too for when I have free time on the go.
Thanks, I'll look into it!
Thanks, I'll look into it!
https://codefights.com has a lot of challenges and you can use swift to solve them
Seems like a lot of people say Treehouse. Treehouse is cool, but honestly I feel like there is a lot of resources out there that doesn't require monthly fee. I did Treehouse and I did like it, it is nice that it is usually always updated and stuff so you don't really run into errors. I really recommend checking out Udemy. There are many different courses on there, and I will agree it is hard to figure out which one to do, but I'm sure any of them would get you a good start into learning. The one I am using is called 'The Complete iOS 11 Developer Course' by Rob Percival. Now if you go and check this or other courses on Udemy, it is $200 and that sounds like it might be a little pricey to just pay $200 right up front. What I can say is that you should NEVER pay $200. I haven't been using the course that long but I have seen it go on sale at least 3 different times in the past few months. They are literally always on sale. I'm not sure if the courses are not worth as much as they say, or if Udemy pays the rest of the cost to teacher in order to gain more students, or what. All I know is that I've seen these courses for $20, $15, $50, and a lot of the ones I looked at are normally $200. And hey, it's your lucky day! I had recently seen a sale end, but I'm looking now and it's on sale for $10! They had been running sales since iOS 11 was coming and everyone could get courses to learn the latest software, maybe they decided to do it again. Unfortunately the sale is only going on for 5 more hours. If you see this in time, definitely check them out. 95% off, definitely worth buying one and trying it, it would be less than a month of treehouse and you can go at whatever pace you want. Just search iOS or Swift and look at the reviews and take your pick. Good luck.
I also had an issue with my app when I was scrolling back up. A label would be too long and I made it so that it would go into 2 lines if it was bigger than 100px, which works fine when you load the app and scroll down, but when you go back up, the text would be on one line and would go outside of the cell. If anyone can think of why, let me know.
Hey man, how are you going from the login controller to the main view controller? Did you drag from the button directly to the new view controler? You wouldn't want to do that. If you are doing a conditional segue like that, you would have to do it in code. I don't see any segue in your code so I am assuming you didn't do that. Basically, instead of dragging from that login button to the new view controller, if you drag from the yellow circle at the top of the login view controller, to the new view controller, it should create a segue. Click on the new connection that shows up (the arrow coming from the first screen to the new screen) and on the sidebar on the right, in the Attributes inspector, you should be able to type an identifier. Call it whatever you want, lets say "loginSegue". Then you come back to your code, and directly under that line that has the comment saying "Sign in successful" you would want to put this line: performSegue(withIdentifier: "loginSegue", sender: nil) Whatever you identifier is, make sure you type it exactly the same. Also, you would want to add this same performSegue line to where you are signing up. So under where it says 'Print("SUCCESS")' you add that, that way when you sign up it also goes to the new screen.
It's also nice to actually check the Terms of Use of the website. Many do not really like scraping. Maybe you are even in luck and they offer you an API.
Always go to the instructors website and click link from his/her website. This way, 90% of the course fee goes to instructor and you will get huge discount. If you go directly to udemy and buy course, it's 50 50 split. When you are thinking to buy some course and thinking about it by opening and closing the course page? After few days udemy Jacks up the price from 15$ to 200$. I just do in cognito mode and viola 15$ again. Udemy is like that kind of place where they make a 15$ product look like 200$ product and give discount on it. 
http://Lynda.com - it’s owned by LinkedIn but offers some great courses on Swift development 
Why not name them with the date they were added in TimeInterval format e.g. 12476128746128.jpg Date().timeIntervalSince1970
 Create a UDID or UUID for them. There are internal methods for this. Or simply iterate by 1 each time you save an image.
Which is boring as fuck if you ask me. 
True okay well they aren’t always on sale and they had a special deal on all iOS 11 courses when that was just about to come out. But yeah it definitely isn’t something anyone should pay full price for.
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-generate-a-random-identifier-using-uuid for an example. This is the best way to do it as it is a unique Id so you can avoid collisions. 
&gt; For example, if I’m downloading an app I’d like to show (in another app made by myself) the network speed. This cannot be done - you cannot get information on what another app is doing.
Somebody down-voted you but never explained why this wouldn't be ideal. A UUID is preferred to a timestamp as it is very strong against collisions, especially if your app were to scale beyond a singular device and into a cloud service. A timestamp to a fraction of a second would not have a high chance of colliding with another, but the possibility is still there and its more probable than with a UUID.
The photos already have a uuid, right? LocalIdentifier. This can also help you not copy the same one twice. 
If you'd want my referral code let me know :) 
Haha. Sure. I took a quick look this morning before work. But it looked promising! Pm your code and if I sign up with them I’ll use it. Someone might as well get something out of me signing up. :)
You test fanatics are losing your minds. How vapid must you be to define the testability of your architecture as the main barometer of its quality. 😒
Easily testable code is generally better than code that is hard to test. Not just because it is tested, but because of how decoupled everything is. Testable code is worth more than just testability.
No shit? You're missing the big picture here, your "general feeling" on the testability of your code while using a certain architecture is an indirect of those things which you want in your architecture. To tunnel vision on testability when designing your architecture is a big mistake, it's not a fucking panacea. 
That's true if all else is equal, but all else is never equal. There's 100 factors that go into quality software, and "[unit] testability" is just one small piece. If I told you I had forked the Swift compiler and made it internally more decoupled (= more testable), would you install it and start using it right now? If you say "Well, no, not in that case because ..." then you're naming some of these other factors that are more important *at the margin*.
Went ahead and read yet another article on this, but this was actually pretty well-done and broke down the use of MVC and bringing it to MVVM. Thanks Lisa! 
&gt; In iOS/MacOS development, due to the introduction of the ViewController, it usually becomes: [picture] It sounds like the author's problem with MVC is that it "usually" is implemented incorrectly. (How do we know this fact? Is MVVM usually implemented correctly? We're never told.) &gt; The problem is we used to write the controller code as well as the view code in the ViewController. It makes the ViewController too complex. That’s why we called it a Massive View Controller. Agreed, that is the problem! So why not fix the problem, and simply take all the non-controller junk out of the controller? I have trouble understanding posts of the form "We did this wrong once, so we're going to completely change architectures to discourage it from ever happening again". Why not simply follow the pretty architecture diagram that Apple provided? It's really not that difficult. What reason do you have to believe the new architecture won't be similarly abused? There's 3 things I notice about all articles like this: 1\. They restate that there is "no silver bullet", and so they justify whatever change they want by redefining the world so their pet strategy is in fact the ultimate goal of software development ("no matter what architecture we decide to use, the ultimate goal is to make test simpler"). And here I was, like an idiot, thinking that my goal was to produce good software that people can use! 2\. Since the goal is no longer to produce quality software, they don't show any evidence that their new strategy is any better at that. Or even an example of a bug that this new architecture would have caught. We're asked to take it on faith that this new strategy is better than the old one. This includes the assumption that it's always implemented correctly, unlike the old one which (despite being simpler) was "usually" not. 3\. They use emoji. I guess the hot new architecture-of-the-month is only good if it's as cute as a teenager's smartphone (click me please). This seems to be the new version of "I wrote a book" (buy me please). You know who else has a cute blog? My dog. The way you sell a successful new architecture is the same as it's always been: to write a successful program using it. Game developers are still reading Carmack's old code, and not because it's on an emoji-laden blog. 
Thanks for the advice. I checked but unfortunately no API.
Some questions because mvvm posts are a inconsistent mess in their implementation: - sd_setImage() in the viewcontroller: thats a network call isn’t it (fetching images from url)? Shouldn’t the imagedata be loaded in the vm and then later converted to uiimage in the vc? - showing cells bound to viewmodels in the sketch, but using non-dynamic viewdata in the implementaton. Why? It would not be possible to lets say add the loaded image later on when the cell is already displayed (unless you want to reload the whole table everytime theres an update) - using the viewcontroller to set fields of the cell is neither binding, nor mvvm: why not pass the viewmodels directly to the cells and let the cells handle viewlogic? Also, same issue as above when handling cell updates. Anyone caring to chime in on these? Am I getting it wrong? On C# it seems to be so easy as there is a clear differentiation between viewmodels and viewdata, while every mvvm „tutorial“ falls back to one large viewmodel for the viewcontroller while all the other views just get viewdata handed to them by the controllers vm. 
These are 80% math and 20% coding challenges tbh.
Just to note, `map` and `flatMap` generally doesn't return a [`Sequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence) but rather a specific type of `Sequence` - an [`Array`]. Also, all versions of `flatMap` will unwrap an `Optional` and either omit it from the resulting `Array` or replace it with the value it contains. You can read about that here (written for Swift 2 but still relevant): [Understanding flatMap](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-2-flatmap/)
Yes I did add that in but I added it in the top because when I put it under the Print("SUCCESS") it says error https://imgur.com/BfbXY8z sorry im still new to Swift.
&gt; There’s also a type called ContiguousArray. Unlike the name suggests, it’s actually the most simple array type in Swift. What is its name supposed to suggest? It sure sounds like the simplest array type to me.
Okay. Do you know what a closure is? It’s basically a block of code that executes after a task has been completed. In this case you are trying to login with Auth.auth().login() or whatever it was, and after that is completed you have the code saying what to do. That block of code with the braces around it is your closure. Now what the error means is that it requires you to use self inside a closure. Whenever you are accessing a variable for your class inside a closure, you need to use self. So in this case, you just needed to say self.performSegue and it will work perfectly fine. If you don’t understand what self means, that is something else to learn, but just know that you must use self inside a closure. Not a huge deal though, because Xcode will detect it and make you fix it before running the code.
I didn't look at the code but is there a flow view with a grid of sprites?
For iterm, checkout https://github.com/lukakerr/dotfiles and have a look at the screenshots. Similar setup as in the first image
Can you tell us what the error is? Are the header file addressed directly? I had a problem once because the headers were addressed directly and Xcode couldn't find them. Without some error messages, screen shots or code samples, it's going to be hard to debug. What happens if you start a brand new empty project and add it in there?
Have you looked at adding it as a submodule? 
Sorry, I'm still pretty new to Swift and iOS in general. Here is the error for the code: https://imgur.com/a/EB22i I'm not too sure about the header file, where should I look for that? I will give it a try with adding it to a new empty project.
Do you have a tutorial for how to do that? I'm pretty new to Swift still.
Do you have a tutorial for how to do that? I'm new to Swift still.
Ok, it looks like it can't find header. I dropped Swift (skipped version 3) a while back and I'm just getting back into it, but I think you need to move the header to where the other headers are, or put in your project setting where your headers are. One thing I've done on some projects is to put all the headers into one area in the project. So if you open finder, you can find out where your project headers are and place the headers in there. This might not be the best idea, because some like things to be sorted out so that every add-on has it's own directory. Your choice there. One other thing I like to do is to have a "master header" file. It's a header file that has links to all the other header files. That way I don't have to search hard for a header. Either way, Xcode doesn't see where the header file is. You should understand that what you see in Xcode, is NOT what the file system looks like. Don't think of the project browser (the left most window in Xcode) as a "finder window". It might look like a finder window, but it's not. Go to the file in question, right click, pick "show in finder" then make that match up with the other headers. Do this by opening up two finder windows. Right click on the headers that work and the headers that don't work. You can then just copy the header from one finder window to the other. Test that with one file and see if the error point changes. Note: Xcode has setting for where to look for headers but I haven't done that in a while. Dumping all the headers into one dir isn't the greatest solution, but should work.
There are few apps that do what I want on App Store: iMonitor and iOpen, check 
Yep: https://www.raywenderlich.com/155150/dependency-management-using-git-submodules They even use Alamofire as an example. For the next project where I need a library I’m going to try this and avoid CocoaPods altogether, I’m not sire what benefit it brings me over submodules. 
Good point! The sd_setImage() discussion has gone for a long time (it's kinda anti-pattern even in the MVC). To me, it's distractive to put everything in the article. So I try to focus on the basic idea of the separation of the presentation layer and the view layer(using UILabel as an example), simplify some trivial implementations at this point. For the second and the third question, it's possible to update a certain cell through a callback, for example, a reloadTableView(at: [IndexPath]). Assign viewmodels to cells and let the cell handle all those things as you stated is another good solution. But again, as I stated in the article, I won't provide a perfect MVVM architecture, what I want to do is to propose a way that you can swallow an elephant one bite at a time. 
Thank you for liking the article :) 
Right! There are a ton of things when it comes to the quality system. That's why I want to focus on a single starting point. IMHO, testability is a good starting point for people to start small. 
The error is gone. Thank you so much for your patience and explaining it to me. I would have never guessed that.
Well technically those goWhenPressed and goWhenPressed2 are functions, not variables. When you create an IBAction, that is a function, meaning it does something when you press it. When you drag the button to your code, if you choose IBOutlet(usually is the default), that would create a variable for your button so you can do things like change the text from within your code, etc. So is your button connected just to the goWhenPressed? Looking back at your originally posted code, you have "func action(_ sender: UIButton)" where most of your login/signup stuff takes place, right? It looks like an IBAction cause it has the 'sender: UIButton' part, but it doesn't actually say IBAction, so I feel like maybe your code is not connected to it? You might want to try dragging from your button to your code again to create a new IBAction, and put all that code inside there. Also, if your button is connected to goWhenPressed like I thought, you can go to the storyboard and click on that button and on the right bar, I think it is the last tab, you can delete connections there if you need to. But yeah, if the rest of the code is correct, just put the self.performSegue in both places and it should work. You're welcome, it is actually really nice to be able to sit here and read something and be able to help someone! A lot of times the questions that get asked are way over my head. I'm definitely no expert, I am learning Swift too, but I have had a little more time with it and I haven't made anything crazy but I am pretty confident at making some basic apps now.
You could check if the remainder of n/5=0? if (indexPath.row % 5 == 0) { // do special things }
Ok thank you I will try that and let you know how it goes.
We had some problems with date parsing if the device was set to am/pm time. The dateformatter by default uses the device locale, if I remember correctly, even when parsing. So try to test different date/time locales on your test device and see if that breaks as well. 
Also if the property you are decoding is optional you can use `decodeIfPresent()`. But if you want to just skip when there is bad data you can do something like this: `date = try? container.decode(Date.self, forKey: .date)` The `try?` should consume the error when it’s thrown by the decoder.
You have a node in every position, so you can make this node have various sprites, like the tiles game did (at the very end of README)
An entirely new architecture is your idea of "starting small"? Do I dare ask what you would consider a large change?
Thanks for the tips. I did try to set a different locale and test, but I did not change am/pm. It does seem strange that the locale matters when I'm providing my own dateFormat, however. Am I missing something?
Thanks. I'm using all automatic decoding and not specifying any coding keys or anything. I guess maybe the thing to do is to specify the dates as Strings in the target object and then parse them manually down the line.
My game engine "Enginite"
This sounds a bit nefarious. 
I don't think that would be a good personal project. It would require a large team. And why bother? It seems unlikely you could do anything in this space that hasn't been done by apple or google. There may also be legal issues involved with a navigation app.
Lol what? I’m asking how to name images. Are you saying the hidden images thing is nefarious? It’s just allows you to save photos in a different place that people wouldn’t suspect, so they aren’t just in your camera roll.
Ha. Okay I get it. I thought it was something that let you take photos secretly but if anyone looked at your phone it would look like you were using a calculator. Kinda spy like.
Oh lol, I guess that could be a thing too. It’s more about just having a hidden photos app.
Actually, it won't take a lot of time learning the idea in my article. But it's difficult to catch up with the "whole" quality system for a starter. Anyway, it would be of great benefit to the community if you also share your thought on how to start the quality things for a starter.
There is no 1 set way to do anything. I suggest dropping that mentality because it can paralyze you. Just do what you do and get the feature working first and then look at ways you can improve upon that... That being said, I've been using [self sizing cells](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/WorkingwithSelf-SizingTableViewCells.html) and used a library like [PureLayout](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout) to easily create constraints with views I've designed in a xib... I just then swap the collapsed view with the opened view. 
So like this? https://imgur.com/uKYJ3wz https://imgur.com/XS5wW8B https://imgur.com/Gqdo4GJ
Close. Is goWhenPressed and goWhenPressed2 connected to signup and login buttons? The code should be in those, not in the viewDidLoad. 
I connected them to the login by control and drag into the code... was that the correct method or no? When I tried it out it worked but I still have the same issue as nothing is happening with the firebase authentication just going from login to the main screen without even a reference of firebase in the debugger...
Have you tried Udemy? You don’t have to pay monthly but if you catch it at the right time you can get great discount. I paid £12 for a £200 course which is great so far.
Never tried to obtain map data from the map so I’m not sure if it’s possible. I think most projects utilise another API to obtain the data. E.g. send lat and long to an address lookup API. 
From https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter: &gt; When working with fixed format dates, such as RFC 3339, you set the dateFormat property to specify a format string. For most fixed formats, you should also set the locale property to a POSIX locale ("en_US_POSIX"), and set the timeZone property to UTC. Which also links to this technical note: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1480/_index.html

wrap the collapsed and open state in a view, add a height constraint, when you need to swap height change the constraint and call tableView.begin/end updates without anything between them.
Awesome response
There's really no way for anyone to answer this without knowing what your app does. Someone would have to compare the offerings of Swift 3 and Swift 4 and then determine if any of the changes would benefit your app. Unless there's general improvements in speed, or something else. Generally, it's best to keep up with things on your own time line. So taking the time to learn Swift 4 and start merging things over isn't a bad idea.
You can vertically stack two views. Showing / hiding the bottom view should create the affect you’re after.
Depending on what your app is and how it's built, there are new features in swift 4 that may improve ease of maintenance and overall performance of your app. What bugs or challenges you will face will likely be taken care of. Also, it's only a matter of time before the current version of swift is unusable. For example, Xcode9 does not support swift 3.1 and earlier.
Cool, I'll check it out.
This is another of those cases where Swift uses the same syntax as other languages people know, but that syntax actually does something completely different than you're used to. In C, `&amp;` says "take the memory address of this". `playerInfo.health` and `playerInfo.energy`. Your two slots have different memory addresses, so there's no issue. In Swift, `&amp;` merely says "Yes, I know I'm passing this as an [inout](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-ID545) parameter". Inout parameters are implemented as "make a copy (of the entire structure), let the caller operate on the copy, and then copy it back when you're done". 
Okay, so I did the UUID and its all great. I saved the images and I was saving an array to userdefaults that contained the local urls of the images. When the view loads it loads that array and creates images for each one. But for whatever reason, it fails to create UIImage. The url loads properly, I can print it out, but I am trying to initialize the UIImage with path and it coming back nil
Probably the highest is Strings being collections again. There are some either minor changes. I would upgrade ASAP only because you’ll have to at some point, and the sooner you do it the easier it will be.
&gt; These compile and run just fine and give consistent result. Even the second one? What version of Swift are you using, and in which context? (REPL, Xcode project, playground in Xcode, etc.)
Xcode crashes on me too, but the .ipa still gets exported somewhere. Is it not exporting anything at all?

You will have to form a model that tracks the state of the collapsed or expanded sections. When the first cell in a "group" is tapped, you just update your model to make it collapsed and tell the table view to remove the cells that need to "collapse" Do the opposite for expanding
it crashes before i choose an export directory, where has yours been showing up?
Xcode 9.0 (9A235) from the App Store. Compile and run fine and give the correct result. 
If you can turn off @objc inference, it will have an impact on your generated code size. How much depends on how much interaction with Objective-C you have in your app.
Automatic dependency resolution and updating, for two. 
Ok, I see. Thanks for the explanation. &lt;&lt;The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4)&gt;&gt; Memory Safety section does not explain why at all. Why is this example also a problem: var stepSize = 1 func increment(_ number: inout Int) { number += stepSize } increment(&amp;stepSize) // Error: conflicting accesses to stepSize It compile and run, stepSize == 2 in the end. They should just eliminate the '&amp;' prefix. It should be like C++ pass by reference argument. This use of '&amp;' is inconsistent: in user define operator, you don't prefix '&amp;'. '&amp;' look the same as C but it doesn't do the same. Misleading and unnecessary.

Thanks for the responses I will be checking through the various ways of implementing the same thing, I have updated the post with something I came up with , would be really interested in knowing what you think. Thanks again.
Just seems like a bug with the documentation. Some of the examples trigger the error, others don't. Use the feedback link on that page.
`&amp;` is still important functionally. Not all symbols mean the same things in every language, it's something you need to get used to.
Why do you think you can’t update a submodule?
You can, you just have no way of know if the update is compatible with the rest of your code. e.g. I can update to specific versions, all major, minor, or patch versions, or not, automatically with some sort of dependency manager. Submodules gets you none of that. They've become easier and more reliable over the years but they're certainly not a replacement for an actual dependency manager.
You can update to any individual branch or commit so of course you can do all of that. Even better, if you find a bug or improvement you can submit a fix directly. 
Did you have a 30 minute interview over the phone? I have one coming up with them and am curious to know what some of the questions are that they asked you.

Hi Eveloper! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising).

Yeah the talk was about 30 minutes or so. I remember being asked if I had experience with backend stuff. What sort of projects or services I would make if I used their software. And more generally what is my overall experience as an iOS developer... 
I will try that!
[removed]
No, it wasn’t that. Thanks for trying though.
This is also an issue in C/C++. Look up "pointer aliasing". The results can vary by compiler version, optimization settings and the phase of the moon and are generally not guaranteed. Swift helps you find some of them at compile time but, in general, it cannot find all possible occurrences in complex code. Some compilers have settings that guarantee consistent behavior at the cost of giving up many possible optimization opportunities. 
It does to wherever I chose for it to be exported to. When you get to the organizer, are you selecting “Export” or “Validate”? If the former, try selecting “Validate” and when it tells you the process is finished, it has another Export button you can choose within the message window. That’s the way I’ve been doing it. If nothing else works, try reinstalling Xcode. I know that sucks, but this version does not feel very stable and has been giving everyone a lot of problems.
Validate also crashes the app. I guess i’ll try reinstalling. Any tips on making sure it’s fully uninstalled? Thank you. 
Just make sure you app’s folders are in a superset location from XCode I guess.
I don’t think too much, but probably upgrade your code now to Swift 4 (most of times, not a big deal), then to have it upgraded at Swift 5 or something, which will probably be even more different.
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but Xcode launches and doesn't run any setup.. as if it wasn't fully uninstalled. I tried deleting caches but I don't think i was thorough enough. How can i ensure it's completely removed before reinstalling?

Great work OP! I actually use a similar extension for Chrome - [#Clicky](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clicky-for-slack/bllgmdlgbbmijcoecbnmgeoekhebgmac)
Ah, that's why. If you use something other than a playground, like a macOS app or `swift` from Terminal, you should see the same errors pointed out as the page you linked to earlier. Playgrounds don't have exclusivity checking enabled, which is a bug.
Do you see any examples where the text claims there will be an error, but that don't actually result in one when you compile and run? I think the discrepancies that youngermann is seeing are a bug related to how playgrounds in Xcode run Swift.
There have been lots of improvement to Swift so it is possible that your app will run better with a minimal upgrade. As for end user benefiting the real issue here would be finding bugs you don't know about or refactoring code that shouldn't have been accepted by the old compiler. Your user will benefit if you can leverage new features in Swift 4 to speed up the app but that might be a major rewrite. What bothers me about this post more than anything is that it reflects some fo the same stupid we have seen in the Python community where people for what ever reason never got on the Python 3 band wagon. It is really stupid to get left behind because you are a Luddite and can't grasp the importance of moving forward. Now there are qualifications to moving forward, if the program has a limited lifetime then spending time on a translation would not be wise. A limited lifetime in this case would be at most 2 years. In a nutshell you can be like a whining pathetic Python2 programmer that cries aobut support for Python 2 going than end even though you have had 10 years to switch over. In Apple case though you won't get ten years at all, you will be lucky if they support Swift 3 for 2 years. In this case you either keep on top the technology or gut buried under it.
&gt; In a nutshell you can be like a whining pathetic Python2 programmer that cries about support for Python 2 going than end even though you have had 10 years to switch over. I hope you're not drawing conclusions about me here. I have just sacrificed my last few weekends adapting my app to iOS 11 and the fiasco that is iPhone X, so I am by no means stuck "behind the times". I just want to know whether there's any tangible reason I should sacrifice yet another weekend porting my code to Swift 4 and re-testing everything. I'm happy to upgrade to Swift 4, but I need some context to prioritise how to spend my limited development time; if it's going to make no difference to the user, and given that I'm ready to release my app already, there has to be some real justification for delaying the release of my first version.
This is taking way too much over the user’s experience. If they don’t have their email configured, there’s probably a good reason. Accept it and move on. 
For example, I get no error from this: var stepSize = 1 func incrementInPlace(_ number: inout Int) { number += stepSize } incrementInPlace(&amp;stepSize) but this one does: func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) { let sum = x + y x = sum / 2 y = sum - x } var playerOneScore = 42 var playerTwoScore = 30 balance(&amp;playerOneScore, &amp;playerTwoScore) // OK balance(&amp;playerOneScore, &amp;playerOneScore)
Use CoreLocation's CLGeocoder class. There's two methods you can use to reverse geocode an annotation's coordinates. - (void)reverseGeocodeLocation:(CLLocation *)location completionHandler:(CLGeocodeCompletionHandler)completionHandler; - (void)reverseGeocodeLocation:(CLLocation *)location preferredLocale:(nullable NSLocale *)locale completionHandler:(CLGeocodeCompletionHandler)completionHandler
&gt; here I dropped them a bug report but not sure whether they will reply. Also having the same problem, unfortunately can't get Jim's server to work either.
Replying to my own issue in case someone encounters this: addressing localhost will work from the local device, such as the xcode simulator, but not if you're using an external iPhone or iPad to run your code. 
I see a runtime exclusivity error (read during write) from the first, and a compile-time exclusivity error from the second. (Using Xcode 9A235.) You can tell it'll be a runtime error from the SIL: // swiftc -emit-sil example_1.swift | egrep -i7 'begin_access' // function_ref incrementInPlace(_:) %7 = function_ref @_T09example_116incrementInPlaceySizF : $@convention(thin) (@inout Int) -&gt; () // user: %9 %8 = begin_access [modify] [dynamic] %3 : $*Int // users: %10, %9 %9 = apply %7(%8) : $@convention(thin) (@inout Int) -&gt; () end_access %8 : $*Int // id: %10 // incrementInPlace(_:) sil hidden @_T09example_116incrementInPlaceySizF : $@convention(thin) (@inout Int) -&gt; () { // %0 // users: %6, %2 bb0(%0 : $*Int): %1 = global_addr @_T09example_18stepSizeSiv : $*Int // user: %3 debug_value_addr %0 : $*Int, var, name "number", argno 1 // id: %2 %3 = begin_access [read] [dynamic] %1 : $*Int // users: %4, %5 %4 = load %3 : $*Int // user: %9 end_access %3 : $*Int // id: %5
 krilnon is correct, playground no error, but swiftc compile fine, but raise runtime error: &gt;Simultaneous accesses to 0x103d56628, but modification requires exclusive access. &gt;Previous access (a modification) started at memsafe`main + 71 (0x103d53097). &gt;Current access (a read) started at: &gt;0 libswiftCore.dylib 0x00000001040a6930 swift_beginAccess + 605 &gt;1 memsafe 0x0000000103d533e0 increment(_:) + 43 &gt;2 memsafe 0x0000000103d53050 main + 83 &gt;3 libdyld.dylib 0x00007fff6c906144 start + 1 &gt;Fatal access conflict detected. &gt;Abort trap: 6 This is for the first example, but it will raise runtime error on every example. 
Considering the docs make exactly two mentions of compile vs. runtime errors, I'm guessing that point needs to be made more clear. So not a doc bug per se, but one of clarity, as it seems the docs should indicate what kind of errors would be seen.
What were the phone interview details? I have a call scheduled with them on Thursday and would love any insight. 
You need to put userSignedIn into the class implementation to trigger doSegue()
Some questions I remember: * Did you try using SwiftEngine? * What was your experience? - Have you used other Server-Side Swift platforms? - What did you like/not like about them? - Are you interested in these other positions? (lists 10 jobs) There were some very basic REST questions but I can't remember specifically It felt like a weird trick to actually get people to answer survey questions
https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/75az48/anybody_heard_of_swiftengineio/dofair4/
Lot of things here, but I'm on my phone and have to be quick... just a hint, think in three dimensions... in other words, your initial VC appears, sees that you're not logged in so pops up the login. The initial VC is still there, just not at the top of the stack. After the user logs in, the login page just needs to be dismissed. That's easier, and can all be controlled from your initial VC via a notification sent from your AppDelegate. There's a lot of other ways to approach this too, but start small and iterate...
You need a "normal" way to notify InitialViewController about signOn change, it can be done: 1. Post a notification in AppDelegate, listen for it in InitialViewController 2. Get a direct reference for InitialViewController - in AppDelegate: if let initialViewController = self.window?.rootViewController as? InitialViewController {} or if you are using navigation controller: if let navigationController = self.window?.rootViewController as? UINavigationController, let initialViewController = navigationController.viewControllers.first as? InitialViewController {} And then call initialViewController.doSegue() or create another delegate protocol for InitialViewController 
About: var userSignedIn = userSignedInGlobal { didSet { performSegue(withIdentifier: "segueOne", sender: self) } } userSignedIn property is set to userSignedInGlobal on InitialViewController initialization. You never update it after, therefore it keeps reference to the old userSignedInGlobal, when you update userSignedInGlobal in AppDelegate. 
I would check that this, @IBAction func playButton(_ sender: UIButton) Is hocked up on the storyboard.
One of my colleagues, who is a technical writer, recently wrote an article on the same topic. The title of the article is [top 9 useful open source iOS libraries](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/top-open-source-ios-libraries/) Check it out. Lemme know what do you think about it? Any important libraries he missed? Please reply. That'd be helpful. 
Well, what's the type of `self.view`?
&gt; It compile and run, stepSize == 2 in the end. Just because it happens to work doesn't mean it's semantically unambiguous. There's countless examples of programs that happen to work with one version of a compiler, but aren't actually valid. &gt; Why is this example also a problem: There's a paragraph of explanation before that example, and another paragraph of explanation after it, including a diagram. I don't think I can do a better job than that. Do you have specific questions about their explanations? &gt; They should just eliminate the '&amp;' prefix. It should be like C++ pass by reference argument. If you want C++ semantics, you can use C++. Swift has a unique system of value and reference types that C++ doesn't have. &gt; This use of '&amp;' is inconsistent: in user define operator, you don't prefix '&amp;'. Custom operators play by their own syntax rules, anyway. They're not called by writing `classname.funcname(` and `)` around the operands, either. Plus, adding mandatory unary operators to all custom operators would be a parsing nightmare. It's somewhat inconsistent, but there's a dozen places in every language syntax (except Lisp or Forth) that are inconsistent.
That's nice to have, but what end-user benefit is there? Or does it affect build size or build time?
It’s just a lot nicer to write code that deals with strings
I recommend [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) to get started. 
I'm working on Push Me. It's an app that sends you push notifications that you set up yourself. So for example, I get a lot of Github Notifications that mess up my E-mail inbox. I used Push Me to set up an e-mail adress where I get all the notifications delivered. This way I can always be on the ball when something happens, but also mute Github notifications when I'm off :) I'm also using Push Me to follow multiple RSS feeds. When the blog I'm following is updated I get a notification with the title and a link to the post. Push Me also offers to set up anonymous e-mail addresses. I use these when I register for new services. I'm fed up of companies asking me for my e-mail, only to spam me for eternity about random stuff. (AirBNB, I'm looking at you) I've heard from a user that he hooked up his doorbell to Push Me. This way he (and his family) all get a notification on their phones when someone's at the door. And attached to the notifications is a URL that shows a live feed from the door, so they can see who's there :) The best part about Push Me is that I'm not running any metrics/analytics frameworks. I'm only using the metrics Apple gives me, which respect your decision to share metrics with me or not. I'm an independent developer doing this on my spare time. And I'm gonna try to make this work without selling my users privacy to highest bidder. Push Me is available on the App Store and you can send yourself unlimited notifications, completely free. If you want some extra magic sauce you can subscribe to "Push Me PRO" for $5 / month. This includes all current and future PRO features. Push Me is available here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/push-me-stay-in-the-loop/id1208277751?ls=1&amp;mt=8 And while you're at it, plz subscribe to my Youtube channel http://youtube.com/jagcesar Stay awesome!
&gt; '&amp;' can't behave the same as C, because Swift values don't have a singular memory address. Sorry, I only mean to say the '&amp;' prefix for 'inout' parameter is not needed. I'm not asking for Swift to behave like C++. Unless I'm missing something? Eliminate the '&amp;' prefix and we lose nothing.
Not totally related to your question. Have you given a look to the coordinator pattern?
Well I’m trying to hook it up to GameScene.sks and I read online that this is the way to do it.
Thanks for your answer! I finally solved it with SwiftSoup
No.
You need to either find or create a database of opportunities. I would think the easiest way would be to create a public facing website where individuals can submit opportunities. You could theoretically drop the website and only do entry submission through the app, but personally, inputting information like this sounds like a pain in the ass to do through a phone or tablet app. 
So I found this website, called volunteermatch.org. They have where you can put in your area and service pops up. Is there a way to access this information without them providing like a JSON API?
They actually provide an [API](https://solutions.volunteermatch.org/solutions/api). Someone more experienced will have to chime in about whether you can grab this data without using their API. 
Ew. I actually think I saw that when I was browsing but I saw it required payment of some kind. 
Someone worked hard to put all that data together. They’re just trying to make putting together and providing all that data worth doing. If this is educational, it may be worth an email to them just to ask about a discount/non-commercial free license. 
Wtf
Really you can only either update the pods if the contributors have updated to Swift 4, or update it yourself. What pods are the errors coming from? They may have a swift 4 branch.
You can continue to compile the old pod under swift 3.2 mode for now. So if it's not practical to use a swift four branch or make your own changes in a pull request, you can probably just use swift 3.2.
Seriously... why? This uses up so much memory for what you are trying to do.
I'm interested in your reaction. UIImageView has had built-in support for animating a sequence of images since the very first SDK. I can't see what your issue might be, this is exactly what those APIs are for.
Web development and server side development are two different things. There is no means for the former.
[removed]
For now you can ignore the warning. It's a deprecation warning, not a change in behavior... yet.
Google for “server side swift”. Some server side swift frameworks would be: - Vapor - Perfect - Kitura There are a few others, but it can’t remember them off the top of my head. Usually full stack web development requires an assortment of skills: HTML CSS Javascript a Database and a Server side language. That server side language could be anything: PHP, JavaScript, Go, Ruby... In your case, you want to learn Server Side Swift. 
The errors are coming from gRPC. My podfile only uses Firebase, so I'm not quite sure what this is. I started a new project and copy/pasted all my old code and reinstalled the pods, and the number of issues fell quite a bit but now have become Semantic/Lexical issues relating to gRPC. 
&gt; Some compilers have settings that guarantee consistent behavior at the cost of giving up many possible optimization opportunities. Which is actually one of the reasons why Swift was changed to catch most of these at compile time, because previously it did guarantee consistent behavior and it was costing the compiler optimization opportunities.
The `&amp;` syntax exits because silently mutating a parameter in an otherwise pass by value language was considered dangerous by the language designers. The `&amp;` is there so that everyone writing the code, and, more importantly, everyone reading the code can see that the value of the variable can be changed by the function call.
You could turn off the warnings, see if there are updated versions of the frameworks available, or modify them yourself. In my experience, I had to add @objc to any functions that were called via the old #selector syntax.
Allow me to add [9 iOS libraries](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/top-open-source-ios-libraries/) that you can use. One of my colleagues recently wrote it. I hope you may like it. 
Yeah I’m seriously not getting the reactions here. Or are we missing what this is for? This isn’t the first time I’ve seen this feature explained and it’s been explained the same way so I don’t see the issue. 
^This. Isn't it amazing how people just expect everything to be free. This is even more amazing in an iOS dev forum as apps are stolen all the time and devs want/need people to pay for their apps.
Thank you
What’s up with the comments here? I found this very interesting. I can definitely see a use for animating icons in my app. I didn’t even know UIImageView had methods for animation. 
Question. CPU wise which is more heavy. This? Or drawing an animation with beziers with a CA display link? Any ideas?
Animations are vastly overrated. Most of them are useless distractions.
The article starts with a claim that “your app needs to be perfect”. It doesn’t. We all use imperfect apps all the time. Your app needs to provide some value to the user. 
And to be clear, you can compile your code with Swift 4 and library code with Swift 3.2 and have it all work together (but not with pre-3.2 versions).
It's a standalone app rather than an extension of Spotlight, but you have the right idea. A mobile version is high on our list of priorities.
This may feel a bit hacky but should work. let ratingValueRounded = (ratingValue * 10).rounded() / 10
Unfortunately not. Still seeing rating: 3.5999999046325684
And also need to state that Playground do not catch memory safety runtime error, only regular compile does. Most people use Playground to learn and will get confused.
This is a reasonable choice. Too bad `&amp;` is misleading to C people If inout param needs to be clear to caller, then why custom operator do not use `&amp;` prefix? Example: infix operator **=: AdditionPrecedence func **= (_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) { let sum = x + y x = sum / 2 y = sum - x } var a = 20 var b = 30 a **= b // No '&amp;' prefix needed!! a b changed after this...so this is not dangerous? 
That is dangerous, but custom operators tend to be looked at more carefully than function calls anyway and (when suitably named) carry the expectation of mutation with them. In this case the issue is that it's a very, very misleading operator name. The operation I would expect `**=` to perform is: func **= &lt;T: Numeric&gt; (_ lhs: inout T, _ rhs: T) { // Where ** is an operator that raises lhs to the power of rhs. lhs = lhs ** rhs } 
Isn’t it the „normal“ floating point problem? Maybe [this link](http://floating-point-gui.de/basic/) helps you to understand how floating points works 
Hmm. Probably need to see the rest of your code for context. The value of the new variable, valueRatingRounded, should be rounded to 3.6. Maybe it’s just not being properly assigned to the rating value.

Yeah, someday it may be possible with WebAssembly, but not yet. I'm actually developing a server-side Swift project, but the API it exposes is pure JSON not meant for human consumption, but for my separate Angular frontend.
What are the changes?
The simple answer is your print statement is outside the closure. Put it right under the let title line. Inside the brackets.
GraphQL &gt; JSON
It’s not done yet! That means they haven’t decided on a full change list. This is the release process — how they decide what’s going in or not. Realistically it seems like it will mostly be generics improvements and small swift-evolution proposals which hadn’t been fully implemented in 4.0. [Equatable/Hashable Synthesization](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9619) seems likely for inclusion to me.
Not that I've done any tests, but I would assume using images would actually be less CPU intensive. The backing store for the layer would just get switched between the different images, as opposed to redrawing from scratch into a buffer that then gets rendered in the layer. The images obviously take up space in your bundle, so you could get the best of both worlds by rendering your images in code and reusing them.
Do you have a demo project where the only thing running in it is one of these animations? And checked the CPU output?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions in beginning programming, e.g., [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken). [Read all of this](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) if you want the whole story. &gt; I *have* to store this as a float, based on shared objects. Well then you *have* to put up with the precision that Floats give you. If you have to use a 5-gallon bucket you can't complain that it doesn't hold 10 gallons of water. &gt; I cannot figure out how to get the precision correct Type "xcrun swift", and then: import Foundation let r: Float = 3.6 String(format: "%0.16f", r) This is not about Vapor, or Swift. This is how your CPU works.
It doesn't matter what contortions you do as intermediate steps. You're storing the result in a Float, and it's only got 24 bits of mantissa. That data type simply can't hold any more precision. 
&gt; I really like Swift. It's simple and relatively straight-forward. Ha! &gt; However it feels like I am using the static keyword to make the struct do something it is not supposed to do. Isn't a struct supposed to be instantiated? (Or is it called initialized?) There's no rules about that. I've seen classes, structs, and enums all used purely for their container-ness.
What's the problem with NSDecimalNumber? Also, you have a pretty weird definition of "way off"
I just lifted this from Stack Overflow - basically the code you want to execute after you get a response is in a closure let request = NSMutableURLRequest(url:URL(string:"YOUR_URL_HERE" ,param: param))!,cachePolicy: .useProtocolCachePolicy,timeoutInterval:60) request.httpMethod = "POST" // POST ,GET, PUT What you want let session = URLSession.shared let dataTask = session.dataTask(with: request as URLRequest) {data,response,error in do { if let jsonResult = try NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data!, options: []) as? NSDictionary { print("ASynchronous\(jsonResult)") } } catch let error as NSError { print(error.localizedDescription) } } dataTask.resume() 
It Says in the console that it “Could not cast the type ‘UIView’ (0x10f7c3348) to ‘SKView’ (0x10e1e54b0) How do i fix this? I am relatively new to Swift so if you could help me that would be great. 
FYI this is called "blocking" on the response - you are blocking the current thread from running until the request finishes
I'm not familiar with FANN but it looks like it's written in C so you should be able to use it directly from Swift, or write a wrapper for it to make it more Swifty.
First screen cast. Done 3 weeks ago as a test. It's rough but I'm working to get better.
Hey hey, any update? How are things going?
&gt;Swift 4.1 is not binary compatible with 4.0. So what does that mean for projects built with swift 4.0?
Exactly the same thing as with every other release of Swift so far.
Episode 4. I'm getting a little better as I go.
9.0.1 works
Not really, considering 3.2 and 4.0 were binary compatible. The question is, does this breaking compatibility with 3.2 and 4? Does 3.2 even exist with this compiler release?
What would be advanced SceneKit? 
1) It would be easier if you provide pics of how end result should look like - right now it's hard to understand what you're trying to do 2) You can try putting `lblLocConst.constant = 100` to `awakeFromNib` method of your cell - at this point it shouldn't be nil Do you want to apply this only to single cell in the table view?
3.2 and 4.0 we’re binary compatible because 3.2 is just 3.1 but understood by the Swift 4 compiler. Swift 4.1 will retain Swift 3 source compatibility.
I've never had to deal with this scenario. I've only every built from scratch for 3.2 and again for 4.0
Practice.
What about things like 403 HTTP errors? Or does the client code just use the lower level Alamofire errors for that?
Aside from a brief statement on the Swift site (`The vast majority of sources that built with the Swift 4.0 compiler (including those using the Swift 3 compatibility mode) should compile with the Swift 4.1 compiler.`), I can find no other info. I'm guessing that means there will be a "3.2" mode in the 4.1 compiler as well. Confusingly this means that 4.0/3.2 and 4.1/3.2 code aren't compatible. It also means that 3.2 code built by both compilers aren't compatible either, which could be really weird. It also means there's a discontinuity in the list of compatible Swift versions, which is fun.
OK, it's the same as *many* other Swift releases. Since Swift isn't guaranteed to be binary compatible across releases, in the general case, you had to rebuild. There were exceptions to this.
&gt; 3.2 is just 3.1 but understood by the Swift 4 compiler Really? [The Swift.org page](https://swift.org/migration-guide-swift4/) says: &gt; Keep in mind that Swift 3.2 does have significant changes from 3.1, as well as the SDKs against which you built, so you may need to resolve errors initially.
Ah, you're right, I had forgotten about SDK differences. Still, 3.2 (neé Swift 3 Compatibility Mode) will remain in the 4.1 compiler, as per the page: &gt; The vast majority of sources that built with the Swift 4.0 compiler (including those using the Swift 3 compatibility mode) should compile with the Swift 4.1 compiler. 
I had set up a scheduled phone interview with them that was supposed to take place an hour ago, but they never called me or replied to my e-mail. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but expect that they may ghost you as the top commenter mentioned.
Wow, sorry for the experience you just had with them. This is very disheartening and I hope they don’t continue to do this to people. 
I'd have a protocol defining all the color classes, so whenever you add a new theme, you don't forget to set each one of them. And then you also need to manage changing themes.
The one with Rob Percival(?) is a good one, I can personally vouch for him. But keep two things in mind: 1. Only purchase one swift course as they basically go through the same thing. 2. They don't teach advanced stuff, you'll need the community for that.
Practice. Anecdotally, someone I follow on Twitter whose name I forget wrote a book on the entire thing, is well regarded for his understanding of it, and still claims he doesn’t know much about it. I fear it may be quite complex and perhaps a slightly underdeveloped SDK but that’s a guy feeling.
When I call `validate()` it handles all unacceptable status codes, so anything from 200 to 299 is ok but anything else returns a failure case, hence the `customError` with the parameter.
What's this? 
anti-pattern
What are some examples of advanced topics? Just curious 
I understand that probably isnt the best wording but all the udemy courses and youtube videos seem to only teach the basics. But im worried about what happens when i move past that.
Yea, I wasn't sure if i should just go with Unity (as there appears to be a lot more lessons/tutorials on it), but Im already very comfortable with swift and I only want to develop on the iOS platform so it feels sensible to go with the more native SDK.
Thanks for the help. I have 5 labels within a repeating cell within a table view. Im looking to change 1 of those labels width when starting up (as it needs to change at times). I'll peek into awafeFromNib and see if that is a possibility, thanks. 
If you take whatever you'd do semantically and roll it up a bit more into your own errors, you better isolate your own code from Alamofire. 
If you want anyone to ever use any of your projects you gotta include a `/readme.md file.
That reminds me I really need to get on my readme.md but the sad thing is most places interested in me dont even look at my projects. They all have tech recruiters and those guys just skim the resume and then they're like "you look like a great fit!" I mean, I know they probably do it because they have their own expectations to hit but cmon man But like I said I can't complain too much because I don't have useful readmes for my individual projects
try to see if the navigationController is not nil, because the optional chaining "navigationController?.pushViewController"
Is the cell even receiving a response? Check to make sure that you have everything linked up and connected
Do this, let catVC = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("DashboardController") as! CategoryVC self.presentViewController(next, animated: true, completion: nil)
Depends if you want to keep using the latest versions of Xcode (and use the latest APIs as a result), because eventually Swift 3 will be removed like Swift 2 was after couple of Xcode releases. It’s also not that big a job from 3-4 compared to 2-3. 
I’d challenge that and say the best thing in Swift 4 is the encodable stuff. 
I actually disagree. Rob Percival will cover the absolute basics but he doesn’t even cover good practice on how to organize a project. Every example he provides is forced into one view controller. While reducing the amount of moving parts when you first start is a good thing, I think the course should have taken a turn about half way through. 
You just need different structs nested together for this. Look at something like: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44549310/how-to-decode-a-nested-json-struct-with-swift-decodable-protocol
Subclassing JSONDecoder seems like the wrong approach to me. Furthermore calling your subclass `Decoder` is even worse since it collides with the protocol name. And I agree passing the entire response object in to be decoded seems wrong. The decoder object should have clear responsibilities and this seems to complicate them. But if you’re dead set on this approach then you could just use an extension on JSONDecoder instead of defining your own new type. Maybe even use a protocol extension on Decoder itself. Personally I would just use JSONDecoder as is, perhaps using a factory method to vend an instance that is properly configured for your use. My $0.02 
Good article
Did you even try to solve it? This is the most frequently asked Swift question of all. If you googled that error message you'd find dozens of pages with a description of your problem, and the solution.
I tried googling it for like an hour. As I already said I’m really new to swift and programming in general so it is confusing for me. Could you explain what I have to do?
I agree, the Decoder object seems to have a vague definition of its use once I begin passing in a response which then handles decoding the JSON. Maybe another separate object to handle the response could be a little better, but still probably not the way to go and would probably be better off handling the response on a case by case basis. I do feel the other 2 helper functions can have valuable use though nonetheless which I'll probably implement with a protocol extension.
Check your iboutlets
You need to properly hook up the UILabel 'lbl' to the label in your storyboard. https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/ConnectTheUIToCode.html
I would never include a pod for what is essentially an extension with spatious room for improvement and an enum.
No, it was an honest question. I wasn’t being flip. It seems like it’s just a bunch of basic tools that can be mixed together into more complex appearing presentation. I thought you might be pursuing something like geometry creation. Such as Boolean operations on primitives. I’ve been looking down that rabbit hole for some time. But it does not appear to pass neatly through SceneKit. 
`self.view as! SKView!` says "take `self.view` and assume it's an `SKView!`, and if it's not, go ahead and crash". You're giving it something that is not of type `SKView!`. You haven't showed us where or how `self.view` is set.
Get a readme file in that repo and that will help a lot with telling people what it does. If if a couple of people skim past it at least they know what their skimming past. :)
OK, nice, but what is its type?
You definitely need to write your own server component - no one but you knows how your game is supposed to function. I recommend starting with a real-time chat app. The concept is much easier to grasp from a model/implementation standpoint, but still exposes you to the gritty details of networking. I recommend giving WebSockets a try, as they're more efficient than HTTP long polling. [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream/) is a great API for interacting with WebSockets both client- and server-side.
The problem at line 15 is when your code executes the `lbl` variable is nil, meaning it doesn't point to an actual UILabel. There are many reasons why this could be happening from the simple, you forgot to link the label in IB/Storyboard to the @IBOutlet in the code, to the more complex timing issue (accessing the lbl before the automatic linking happens). In your streamable I can see that the @IBOutlet for label is showing that it's linked to IB (filled in circle in right hand gutter). So that is probably (probably) not the issue. What you need to do is put a breakpoint on that line of code and check if lbl is set, that will confirm that what I've told you is the issue (nil lbl). Then you need to look at the call stack and see what code was called before your `newQuestion` function. Debugging code is a huge part of programming and a skill you will need to develop. I can't offer more help without more information but hopefully this gets you started in the right direction. Also I'm hoping it's a paste issue, but your `viewdidLoad` and `didreceiveMemoryWarning` functions are contained in your `viewDidAppear` function. If you aren't doing anything but calling `super.function` in a given function you can just leave it out of your code.
&gt;If you need to do specific things for all devices above or below a certain size, then this is where the `rawValue` of `Int` for the `ScreenType` enum comes in handy Could have made it `Comparable` instead. Also, `UIScreen.current` is way too confusing because it doesn't return a `UIScreen` instance (compare that to `UIDevice.current`) and there's already `UIScreen.main`.
Is there anything these do that is specific to UITableViewController?
Thanks for the tip. I will check out some real time chat apps and see how they can be applied in my situation.
I just don't want to go through the trouble of fully customizing a tableview when it's so much easier to do with just a viewcontroller
Try a chat app
Can we all take a moment to appreciate how absolutely *insane* it is that Apple doesn’t have a built in way to do this? It’d be one thing of this was Android which supports thousands of platforms, but iOS runs on, like, eight total device types. And there are observable differences with how the built-in UI elements render on those devices, so it’s not like we can just rely on UIKit/Autolayout to handle all the details for us.
But you really can rely on auto layout to do it for you. If you play by the rules, everything “just works”.
Using the screens bounds to determine the device model isn't the best idea. Your code might stop working as expected after a couple of models with no update. There can also be different factors that can affect the screen size. A better approach is to use something like this extension: extension UIDevice { var modelIdentifier: String { if let simulatorModelId = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["SIMULATOR_MODEL_IDENTIFIER"] { return simulatorModelId } var sysInfo = utsname() uname(&amp;sysInfo) if let modelId = String(bytes: Data(bytes: &amp;sysInfo.machine, count: Int(_SYS_NAMELEN)), encoding: .ascii)?.trimmingCharacters(in: .controlCharacters) { return modelId } else { return model } } } This will return the [device identification string](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models) (e.x. iPhone9,1 for the iPhone 7) 
From my experience you can build 99.9% of the UIs you need if you apply auto layout correctly. Especially if the designs follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines or are generally build using basic good practices. So I believe Apple is right not to provide this because it discourages developers from building apps in a way that distinguishes between devices.
You don't need a different view for each question - that's adding a lot of unnecessary clutter to your app. You can reuse the same view to display all questions and have one 'totalScore' variable in the view's view controller. You can store your questions and answers in a file (plist for example) and load the questions to a label -&gt; then compare the answer given in the text box to the answer in the plist file. Then increment totalScore if the user is correct.
This is great, especially during the learning phase. Keep it up! 
Really appreciate the advice and I think you're right on both points. I actually implemented `Comparable` as you suggested and updated the article and samples to reflect that. Thank you!
if you are using storyboard, you will need to use the prepareForSegue, then you can access the next viewcontroller before was presented, then setting some variable in that viewController. if you are using .XIB or viewCode, just create some custom init or a little bit more complex use a inject dependency system 
Agreed. If it’s under ~1k lines I usually write my own variation to save the headache of keeping such a small library up to date
I recently wrote an alt `UserDefaults` interface library: https://github.com/Nirma/Default Basically its protocol extensions that save / load UserDefaults as methods on the object instead of using UserDefaults directly. 
Good article! Thanks for writing it!
Why? What exactly is the use case for this?
From the comments at the end of the article: "Swift structs are passed by value. Sometimes that means passing by copy, but often it doesn't." How can something be passed by value and not be a copy? I was always taught that here are two ways to pass something, the pointer and the value. The value makes a copy of the item and passes that. how can by the info get to the method, not be a pointer and not be a copy?
How about a shared todo/event list? Have users sign up, start an event (like a meetup or something) and then have people be able to browse what events are listed. Pretty much like a meetup clone, but maybe for temp "on the fly" events. You could structure it so that you have rights for who can view, who can add, etc...
Semantically, Swift is completely pass by value. Even inout parameters are, semantically, pass by value and copy back.This does not mean that the compiler always copies the whole value when passing structures. The compiler is free to substitute completely copying a value that is never mutated with passing a reference to that value. The important thing is that the code always behaves as if the copying had been done. In fact, the recent additions of exclusive access checks were done in part to ensure that the compiler could safely optimize inout parameters into pointers in all cases. This is, of course, in addition to being required for implementing the planned ownership system. PS. You may be wondering about reference types, such as objects or indirect enums, while they do have reference semantics, i.e. changes to the object effect all other references to it and their identity can be observed, they are also value types. Their value simply happens to be a pointer to the objects data. The only magic that is applied to reference types is ARC.
Thanks for letting me google it for your! ;) https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/mqtt_on_ios check out the implementations in the mentioned repos.
Do you have a concrete example?
You can already check if it’s an iPad or an iPhone as well as use size classes. With safe areas (which are backwards compatible with earlier iOS version) you can easily account for iPhone X by making content align to the safe area and everything else go right into the corners (which on an iPhone 7 will look the same as it always has). Apple are specifically trying to stop people from making iPhone X-only UIs because that’s not future proofed or scalable. 
By the time you’ve found one you could have learnt to make one yourself 😉
I have a specific repo I’m using. The problem isn’t so much how to MQTT-IOS as how to implement an efficient design that is not polling.
You can set the frame of the image to be equal to the view.bounds.width and view.bounds.height which will make the image fill the view it is in, and then you can center the image by using .center which takes a CGPoint of, in this case, view.bounds.width/2 and view.bounds.height/2. Mind you, constraints could do the same and provide easier scaling of the image, so you could use that.
I'm happy that you liked it! It's an article of my colleague. I enjoyed it a lot! Mainly because it explains basics of building frameworks in a very easy ways and with puppy app.
The game scenes type is SKScene and whenever I try to change the SKView to SKScene I get a lot of errors
Ok, so why would Swift do that? By ref would use so much less memory and why would they bother making a language with by ref as an option and not actually use it? The original question was about a comment where he said there was something other that by ref and by val. What was that other option or was it a combo of both?
A micro blog. A turn based game like chess or checkers using websockets. A market for buying/selling products. Take a pic, put a price and post it.
And this is what's wrong with Swift, IMHO. Look at node.js for example, it's trivial to keep a package up-to-date. I wouldn't even bother writing a custom one if it's just 50 LOCs.
I made one using a scrollview and uiview. But it also would expand out for more options. This was all done programmatically and would add buttons as needed. After reading a conversation here, I think that it violated some Apple design principle in the way it expanded options. I don’t remember exactly. But that lead to a better solution anyway. As far as the Tableview goes, I’m not sure my way was any simpler. Plus tableview has inherent standards the user already would instinctively know how to interact with.
Hey man! My girlfriend was trying to load your app but it kept getting stuck at 60%. Is this a bug? How do I get around it?
Basically, forget that it's HTML, I want to search a string of nonsense for a sequence of characters, read the characters that follow that sequence into a string variable up until a certain character and then continue searching for another occurrence of that sequence to repeat the process.
Hi, Is it possible to change the image orientation within this section too? Ie from portrait to landscape? 
Sounds like you want to use a [`Scanner`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/scanner) which is for working our way through a string scanning in values as you go. First you create a `Scanner` with the html content. Then inside of a loop you: - call `scanUpTo` with the start string, this the set the position to the first character of the start string - call `scanString` with the start string, this will set the position to be the first character after the start string - call `scanUpTo` with the end string and a variable to store the string between start and end. You just keep repeating those steps while all three methods return `true`.
I'm sorry I'm not familiar enough with swift libraries to answer your question but I was curious how you went about reading an HTML file like that. Is it as simple as opening a file with the address being the URL?
There is value (heh) in passing structs by value. When you get passed a struct, you know it will not change out from underneath you. For example, in ObjC both NSString and NSArray were classes, passed by reference. That meant when you were passed a string or an array, you could never be sure some other code somewhere that was also holding on to the same object wouldn't mutate it behind your back. That meant in order to code defensively you had to make a copy anyway (but at least this was optimized - if the string or array was actually immutable you'd get the same object back). There are a number of optimizations used to make pass-by-value more efficient in Swift. Like Nobody mentioned, the compiler will secretly pass by reference if it can prove the operation is safe. Swift also uses a lot of copy-on-write under the hood. For example, take Array: an array may contain a huge number of items, so you don't want to have to unnecessarily copy the array as you pass it around (if the array contained value types, those would all have to be copied too!). So what Array does, under the hood, is keep a *reference* to its contents. That way when an array is passed somewhere, the contents don't need to get copied (we just have another copy of the pointer to the contents). "But wait!" You say, "now we've lost the benefits of value semantics! What happens when other code holding another copy of that array mutates the array?" This is where copy-on-write comes in: if you attempt to mutate an array, and the array detects there are multiple copies referencing the same contents, **then** the array you're mutating finally makes a unique copy of the contents and then mutates it's own unique copy. You get the best of both worlds - value semantics (you know your copy is *yours*) with the efficiency of reference semantics wherever possible. 
Use regex matching: https://www.raywenderlich.com/30288/nsregularexpression-tutorial-and-cheat-sheet
If you check the C Interoperability chapter of Apple's "Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C" (Swift 4.0) you'll find this under Function Pointers: &gt;When calling a function that takes a function pointer argument, you can pass a top-level Swift function, a closure literal, or nil. Not 100% sure that's exactly the situation you're asking about, but either way the implication is C interop still requires top-level functions or closures.
I’m making my way through the end of ‘Intro to App Development’ course, and shortly gonna start the ‘App Development’ one. Then I need to cram cram cram and build a conference app that feeds into an API (that will also connect to a web app). By the end of December lol. Wish me luck!
Yeah you’ll definitely need a server of some sort (Heroku?) to get online multiplayer working 
Be nice 
I had this same problem and found a solution - keeping in mind that this problem can come from a TON of different issues. My problem was that I was segueing to the ViewController class and not the storyboard view. So my reference to the storyboard cell was meaningless, since the storyboard wasn't being used. I was doing this: let viewControllerB = SubViewController() viewControllerB.passedData = diseases[indexPath.row].name navigationController?.pushViewController(viewControllerB, animated: true) And I needed to do something like this: let storyBoard : UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle:nil) let nextViewController = storyBoard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "SubViewStoryboardController") as! SubViewController nextViewController.passedData = diseases[indexPath.row].name self.present(nextViewController, animated:true, completion:nil)
[Please don't](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454)
You can't build a full-fledged html parser using just regex. However, if you know the format of your html -- MEANING THAT THE HTML YOU WILL BE RECEIVING ACTUALLY BELONGS TO A REGULAR LANGUAGE -- then parsing it with regex is fine. In this case, OP knows what he is looking for, and regex is absolutely the right tool for the job.
Again, the compiler usually does pass large structs and inout parameters by reference, however, because the language semantically uses pass by value the compiler can check for cases in which using references can cause incorrect results and emit the copy for those cases. The decision of whether to use a reference or value type in Swift is usually (but not always) about the proper semantics of the type instead of efficiency.
You first need to download the file from the network. Look at https://www.raywenderlich.com/158106/urlsession-tutorial-getting-started
I can see that, but you still have the issue of who's write gets written. This is the age old shared database problem. We used to write special rules for things. Example: in one case, the display would show your edits to the database as shaded, then it would get a confirm and show that the edits were written to the table. Another example would be if you grab a copy of the record, someone else changes it, you also change it, which record gets written? What if you change the price of a part number and someone else changes that part number? All kinds of issues going on there. I guess this means we have a defined default behavior and we have to write our own rules based on how something is going to be used. That's pretty much the only way things can work, just like with databases, have to know the usage to make the rules.

They just wanna use rn cause it also develop android
I know that’s one of the big advantages, but on the phone he said that a lot of their users are on iOS
I've done some RN projects -- I'll try to be honest: - I love the component-driven approach to UI dev and I think being able to define the UI strictly in code (without the use of Xcode's IB) is awesome. Working with this type of system makes me feel very productive and avoids the random merge conflict between two minor UI changes that drove me nuts with standard iOS dev tooling. Component reuse, clarity, and explicit event binding are all wins in the RN paradigm. - the build tools were really buggy -- especially the "auto-refresh on changes" thing. That being said the Chrome dev debugging environment is sweet. - there are a ton of useful JS / React libraries (since the JS standard library is so minimal) but many of them assume browser / nodeJS runtimes. RN still isn't a first-class citizen, and last I saw you'd get browser runtime stuff with the dev tools open and not get it when they are closed so it's weird to try to figure out certain issues with libraries that try to detect where they're being used - speaking of libraries, people are shipping ES6 source (not compiled JS) which means you get to deal with both runtime and build time dependencies. So frustrating to run into a collision between the Babel transforms between two libraries - testing was awfully difficult / annoying in the early days, it doesn't seem to be something the community prioritized early, but it's improved a bit in 2017. - working with "Truly Native" libraries can be a mixed bag, and can get especially difficult if they have UI stuff bundled in. - my teammate (previous android experience) felt it overall represented a net loss in delivery of code, I felt it was about the same. Most nontrivial apps will have differences between the platforms, the "write once deploy anywhere" is only true for simple interactions tl;dr: would only use it for smaller projects
That’s funny because this company’s app has at least 100,000 unique users a day, I don’t know what they use for their backend but it can’t be much because there is only one backend contractor. Also the majority of their users are on iOS. The app is structured pretty good, but the amount of requests is probably absurd enough to where they need like 3-4 more back end devs. 
i hate that companies think by using rn they can develop a good app. i rather use native swift to get everything at its best potential &amp; i rather use kotlin to develop android 
I knew going into the phone interview it was gonna be a crapshoot because prior to it I did some research and looked at the company’s Github and saw that they had pinned RN repos and other frameworks, also the guy on the phone said they were hiring for full-stack but then said they’re only looking for someone mainly for backend development with JavaScript, so that made it appear to me they’re all over the place
Um, load balancer? Some huge apps use React Native. It’s doable and satisfactory if you don’t get too aggressive with talking to the metal
I’m assuming that yeah, I don’t know too much about it.
Modern regex can parse more than regular languages. I still wouldn’t use it for html :p
That's pretty much exactly what I'm talking about, and that text is indicating no change from previous Swift. And since I can't find anything indicating that it _has_ changed, I'll assume that any testing success is undefined. Thanks, kind stranger! 
That's not applicable to Swift value types though. Any time the refcount of the internal buffer is greater than one during a write, the buffer is copied before it is written too. You're never writing to the same buffer that someone else is writing to. If I have this code: var array1 = Array(1...5) var array2 = array1 \\ These arrays currently share storage. print(\(array1), \(array2)) \\ prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] array1.append(6) // array1 copies it's storage then appends 6 print(\(array1), (array2)) \\ prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] array2[2] = 9 // array2 no longer shares storage, no copy happens. print(\(array1), (array2)) \\ prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 9, 4, 5] There are no circumstances outside of using UnsafeMutablePointers where the language allows changes in one array to effect a copy of that array. None whatsoever.
I usually just update Xcode and open the older project. For the most part Xcode automatically will tell you what it’ll fix/change. Depending on your code you may/may not have to change a few things, but nothing so complicated. 
I also interview with a guy last week.They asked me the same question as others, he stood me up once and was 15mins late on the second interview.The guy was speaking really fast and sound like he was reading.Then they asked me to do a coding test.I haven't done it but basically, just asking how to use swiftengine.io website to build a simple messaging board based on their tutorial.I decided to not finish it.
Not to mention ES6 makes JavaScript dare I say awesome
For your sake, please don't. Try reading the article linked by /u/SpaceHonk and the comic. It is a chore and a half to parse html. You could try your hand at parsing json/yaml/xml because they have more rigid specs 
Xcode 9 said it wouldn't do that for Swift 2.
Use Xcode 8 to go to swift 3 and then Xcode 9 to go to swift 4. Good luck. 
I’ve been wrestling with firebase for a few days and I think child() is what you are looking for. child(“number”) etc...
I'd say bearable at best haha
Keep at it you're on the right track! It looks like the data your'e getting back is an array of dictionaries (aka hash, key-value store, etc). So you might be looking for something like this: guard let value = snapshot.value as? [[String: Any]] else { // [[String: Any]] means array of dictionaries // track your error with a tool like Crashlytics return } for dictionary in value { let number = dictionary["number"] as? Int let game = dictionary["Game"] as? String } or as pylearning mentioned I think there are some convenience methods to extract the data 
I'll give it a try but I want to get ALL the data in one go and the child route seems to only grab a piece. It seems less efficient to make a call for each child compared to all one go. I could be completely wrong though so I'll try it. Thanks. I don't want to make to many calls though if Can be avoided to keep the connections to the server down. Not sure if the overhead slows things down much or would cost more. 
Thank you! Idk why I didn't check there. Is that generally how other programming languages handle this task too? Sorry, I'm a CS student but all of my school projects so far have been with local files, and I've been working on a small personal project that require this
Thanks. I'll work on that way too and report back tomorrow. tha is for your positivity!
I mean if he was using an API... things might be different. For static HTML like this though, don't over-engineer it.
You need the data locally in order to parse it. If the file is remote, it can be downloaded, using a framework like the NSURL classes, and then parsed locally. To answer your question, yes pretty much all platforms will have a framework for downloading data. In this case, the framework is Cocoa Foundation and the downloaded data is in HTML format.
You have to convert it to swift 3 with xcode 8 first.
RN is awesome, I used to develop on IOS but never going back, It's much easier for me to build my own projects in one language, Typescript! which is also awesome. I am more interested in backend and cloud anyway so keeping up to date with IOS stuff was a bit much
I went cross-platform for one app that I did. It did add a little overhead - maybe 20% since android was a pain with testing. It wasn't as pretty as native, better than writing two apps. I came back a year later for updates, and it was just a few days of work to add a new feature. It would have been a few days just to deal with the Xcode update. So, depending on business needs, cross platform is a huge win.
I mean small more in the sense of "doesn't have a ton of UI interactions / screens / state / UI complexity" than small in the sense of "number of users" -- RN will put identical strain on a server API to that of a native app in most cases. But if the majority of their users are iOS it's worth pitching native implementations. I wish there was a RN-like framework for cross-platform apps that utilized Swift. As mentioned in some other comments here, ES6 is great but the compiler infrastructure's infinite pluggability is as much a detriment (I need build-time dependencies from libraries at times) as it is a benefit.
No one knows :(
Flutter and dart look pretty friggin slick 
I honestly don’t understand the resentment. If us were that bad, no one would use it. I think low level languages are awful but js is great. Does that make me a poor developer?
The way it compiles right away is cool. But no thanks. After doing a few cross-platform apps, I don't want to experience that ever again. True native or bust
Cheers! I went ahead and just `segue.identifier == "EditAthlete"` instead, but had a quick look around to see if anyone else has had this issue. Is there any way to report bugs in books?
I've dabbled in it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. Never actually completed a project. * The one codebase for both Android and iOS is a joke. Maybe one RN dev for both, but its not one size fits all. * High learning curve just to get started. Webpack is a nightmare, even for season JS devs. I'm obviously biased but I think its 100x easier to get started with iOS native. Probably not terrible to go iOS -&gt; RN especially if you have recent frontend web experience. * Library overload. There's like 5 navigation (think navigation controllers, tab controller) libraries, and none of them are perfect. Libraries are developed and left after 5 months. Its a graveyard and RN isn't even that old. I guess its more fun to build something than maintain it * Overall RN needs some leadership and credibility before I start really developing with it.
Ahhh okay makes sense
I'm in a similar boat, but if you're coming from Objective-C, why do you need to convert Swift 2 code? If you're looking for tutorials or references, there are plenty of Swift 4 resources available. 
&gt; Does that make me a poor developer? Nope! Different people prefer different tools. The trouble (IMO) is when people love using one tool so much that they try to use it for every job.
You can't exactly blame people for being mislead, given how the question was phrased. Searching for the word "Pineapple" in some text is easy, and a good use for regular expressions. I wouldn't start off that problem by saying "I'm trying to parse some English language text", though, because that implies a completely different activity. 
That’ll happen under two conditions. 1) poor management, whether it’s forcing tools upon developers, segmenting teams to restrict knowledge share, or generally not supporting the growth of team members, or 2) if you’re a senior developer on a team and not assisting with the aforementioned reasons. Reason 3 is if a developer blatantly refuses to learn the new technology that is being presented to them in which case I question their career choice.
I find JS to be an absolute horrible language. I hope this isn’t a trend that sticks.

As a user, I haven't seen any JS-pretending-to-be-native application that I actually want to use. They all seem to have some pretty serious limitations. The last one I tried (a major one, from a major company) was using like 10% of my CPU just to show an empty window. To the trash! Since I don't want to use that myself, I don't give it to my users. *That said*, it seems to be really popular with employers right now. If your goal is to get a job at one of these companies, then go for it. If your goal is to deliver the best possible user experience, then I'd stay away. It depends on what you want. People have different goals. The entire reason employers have to pay you is to get you to do something you wouldn't otherwise do! Another thing to remember is hinted at by one of your comments: a lot of software in this world either never ships, or ships but is never used by any significant number of people. It might be a feather in some manager's hat, or a checkmark on some feature list, or whatever. Somebody wants to pay for it, but the buyer isn't the user, and the user doesn't want it. (Think: Safari for Windows.) Again, if your goal is to get a job, then it doesn't matter if anyone *uses* it, as long as somebody *pays* for it. That may or may not be important to you.
Not sure if this is officially supported now. Maybe send an email to the `swift-users` list? What I usually do is pass the object itself as the context: ``` let unmanagedSelf = Unmanaged.passUnretained(self) let context = unmanagedSelf.toOpaque() some_c_func({ let this = Unmanaged&lt;MyClassName&gt;.fromOpaque($0).takeUnretainedValue() this.callback() }, context) ``` Obviously you need to make sure your memory management is correct, since you're manually retaining/releasing it once it's boxed into an `Unmanaged&lt;T&gt;`.
Exactly! I was always told by mentors who have been in the industry for years and they all say user experience is the most important part, functionality plays into that but no one is going to use an application or any product if it doesn’t deliver something that will last. 
&gt; I love the component-driven approach to UI dev and I think being able to define the UI strictly in code (without the use of Xcode's IB) is awesome. Working with this type of system makes me feel very productive and avoids the random merge conflict between two minor UI changes that drove me nuts with standard iOS dev tooling. Component reuse, clarity, and explicit event binding are all wins in the RN paradigm. You can still accomplish this by adding views to the hierarchy yourself and adding AutoLayout constraints programmatically, especially with a library like [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) (Swift) / [Masonry](https://github.com/SnapKit/Masonry) (ObjC).
Haven't checked those out yet, but I definitely will. Appreciate the links!
Actually got this method working! This most closely resembles what I'm used to in C!
You should be able to figure this out with the help that's already been given, but if you're still stuck trying to make sense of Firebase tomorrow, I can probably lend a hand.
You have to convert from 2 to 3 then from 3 to 4. https://www.udemy.com/swift-meat-potatoes-an-intermediate-course-for-swift/?couponCode=SWIFTINT

Just enrolled! Was actually hunting for down Swift tutorials so I’ll be giving you some feedback later today. 
Honestly, with NSLayoutAnchor, I haven't even bothered with any Auto Layout helper libraries. It's kind of like how once we got NSURLSession + blocks, I removed any networking dependencies like ASIHTTPRequest. The system API is sufficiently high-level by now that I don't need to consider a 3rd party library for constraint DSLs...
yeah...you’ll need that
Just so happens that this tutorial was in Swift 2. There's a number of them like this. I guess I can watch the tutorial/read the code and figure out what their doing. Kinda odd that Apple didn't do a conversion from 2, must have been quite a few changes, but they still had the logic in Xcode 8. So the logic is already written, just not included in Xcode 9 for some reason.
I added a couple of convenience anchors like edge anchor &amp; centre anchor, but otherwise I totally agree with you.
I think your general flow is correct. Considering that the action sheet text should override the model content, I would indeed simply set both (in the right order, first model, then the action sheet text) in cellForRowAtIndexPath.
What do you mean set the action sheet text in the cellForRow?
&gt; Does that make me a poor developer? No, not at all. I would not try to make conclusions about your skill as a developer from the language you use! For all I know you can be a great developer working with a poor language. I agree, ES6 is a huge improvement, but the language is still far from "awesome" in my opinion &gt; If js were that bad, no one would use it. Ignoring the fact that there is not much of a choice for web development anyway, there is actually a huge number of popular projects that try to spare people dealing with javascript, by building "better" languages that compile down to javascript. E.g. Coffeescript, Typescript, Flow, Elm, Dart, asm.js, Clojurescript, ... [here's](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js) a pretty long list
You give your cell two instance variables, model and title (where title represents the selected action sheet text). Then you set both variables when creating the cell in cellForRowAtIndexPath: func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell { let myCell = ... // Cell initialisation myCell.model = myModel myCell.title = selectedActionSheetText return myCell } And in your cell you may have something like: var model: MyModel? { didSet { updateData() } } var title: String? { didSet { updateData() } } func updateData() { // First, set up the cell according to the model if let title = title { // Use my title, overriding whatever the model may have set } }
I can't comment directly on JS or RN because I haven't done them, but I understand the business of providing a software product to customers. It's about economics. There's a local company that has been running ads for devs for years. They went from ObjC to Swift to Xarmin and now back to Swift. The Xarmin ads ran for months, then stopped and back to the Swift ads. There's a balance, they need skilled devs and they want them cheap. Going with Xarmin would cut the payroll in about 1/2. Looks like RN is cross platform, don't know if it's any better than Xarmin, but the economics are the same. If the supply of RN devs is low or the skills are lower, they run the risk of 2nd rate product. I ran a software dev company years ago, my customers never asked me about the code, they were interested in the product and it's features. IMO, Xarmin is a bit of a hack. I didn't dig deep, but it's not like Swift/ObjC. There's a LOT of native jobs out there. I don't know JS, but what I hear it's nothing like Swift/Kotlin. Speaking of Kotlin, there's a new reason to stay native... Swift, Kotlin, C# are pretty damn close. One other note from someone that's been around. Companies can chew you up and spit you out, they can go out of business because of a stupid error, they can change direction and leave you behind. Having a skill that is going out of popularity really sucks. When I started iOS, they were asking for 6 months, then they were asking for 1~1.5 years... now they ask for a degree, 3~5 years and several advanced apps published. During DotCom, they were asking for 7~10 years exp... We have to be careful what path we take, I don't think native has ever been the wrong path.
Sorry, forgot to respond. What I meant was, since UITableViewController is a UIViewController, couldn’t you just skip the parts that have to do with the tableView? What tutorial were you using by the way?
Got it. This plus Google and StackOverflow led me to something like this: Used your gaurd code. Then var Game = [Int:String]() var i=0 for dictionary in value { i=i+1 Game.updateValue((dictionary["Game"] as? String)!, forKey: i) } 
Excellent!
Took my first swift programming course on Udemy. Was pretty good if you already have a coding background. Some stuff was pretty basic, but I don't see how anyone without some experience would have made it through with a working knowledge afterward. I have a background using Matlab, so I am comfortable enough to not ask completely stupid questions now. So I powered through the course in about a week, and stopped when I got to some stuff I knew I didn't need for now like Machine learning and AR stuff. Now that I have a decent foundation, I have started making my own MVP iOS app for an idea that I had. Its going slower than I would like, but I have a problem with impatience. Its something that is simple and I know it SHOULD be, but because of my inexperience, I have to tackle things with daily milestones. I am sure some of you guys could whip it up in a few hours, but its been somewhat satisfying doing it myself. If anything, once I get some money rolling (hopefully) I can bring someone else on and then be able to at least have good discussions about things. Got firebase and data handling all done this morning. Now onto putting that data in a spreadsheet view from a cocoa pod. Then the really new stuff for me, like implementing a freemium model. Adding the app store stuff, restricting content and what not. 
UITabBarController &gt;&gt;&gt; Android like side menus
Glad you found a better way! If you find a good resource for firebase let me know! The docs have been pretty helpful
Debating it
Issue a redraw or a reload to the cell at the proper index or issue a reload of the tableView. The tableView should track (internally, you don't do it) which cells need to be redrawn and it will handle this appropriately.
I'm chronically on the watch for force unwraps! I'd put a guard statement to get the value of game. Guard let gameString = dictionary["game"] as String else {return} Game.updateValue(GameString, forKey: i) I also just like putting all my Firebase unwrap code within the init of my Model, after you turn it into a dictionary that is. BUT THAS JUS ME. 
Can you emulate a click on the video at a specific number of seconds?
If I was to reload the cell. Wouldn't it just go back to the models data?
You don't. Codable is for serializing an object, not class static properties. What would that even look like in the JavaScript representation? 
Examine the format of the expected data that you are getting 
Very easy to follow along, thanks :)
I cant blick play
 let webConfiguration = WKWebViewConfiguration() webConfiguration. mediaTypesRequiringUserActionForPlayback = WKAudiovisualMediaTypeNone webView = WKWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: webConfiguration) ...

Thank you for bringing this book to my attention!
Nop :( Still the same
what ios version are you developing for? * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebviewconfiguration/1614794-requiresuseractionformediaplayba * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebviewconfiguration/1614727-mediaplaybackrequiresuseraction those two params should be false as well
So you programmed like you were writing a web app basically?
Maybe you are confused by xcode's coordinate system? In blender, z axis is up and in xcode y axis is up meaning that if you made the scene as you would have in blender, the gravity would be pulling the furniture to the side in the y axis. Basically rotate your scene.
The two existing comments that have highlighted that your UILabel may not have been initialised yet are good. I don’t think that’s the problem, however, because those UI elements initially work, suggesting that they have been correctly wired and loaded. An alternative explanation is your current setup code. You’re getting the error because you’re trying to access an array index that doesn’t exist - questions is an array of 3 elements, which means it’s highest index value is 2. The error would be caused by trying to access index 3 or higher. I suspect that this is the case because you call newQuestion() in your ViewDidAppear() function. newQuestion() ultimately increments currentQuestion’s value without first checking if it’s exceeded the count of the questions array (something which your action function does do). That’s unsafe because ViewDidAppear() is called every time that you back up to that first screen, which is exactly what you’re doing when your app crashes. What you probably want to do is add a safety check in newQuestion() that, if currentQuestion == questions.count -1, causes currentQuestion to equal 0. That way the game will simply wrap around back to the first question instead of crashing.
I don’t know what Cult of Mac might offer specifically but advanced topics include things like Reactive Programming (e.g. RxSwift), alternative architectures (e.g. MVVM, VIPER, Clean Swift), networking (e.g., dependencies between requests), animations, non-Storyboard UIs (e.g. Render or other purely programmatic approaches), non-Core Data object databases (e.g. Realm) or SQL-based solutions, formal routing over segues, etc.
You’ll want to use closures (often called callbacks in other languages). For the sake of Googling what you’re looking for is asynchronous network requests in Swift. I’d personally recommend doing an Alamofire tutorial as they’ll inevitably cover that as part of introducing you to the framework.
If you want to use a strict I’d recommend having it be case based rather than using static functions. For example, struct ColorScheme { case darkTheme, lightTheme, crazyTheme } Then based on the value of the struct you can modify the UI.
Why do you throw shit at people who are not using the "superior" language you have chosen?

Insecurity 
I am on similar boat right now. I got a task where I have to convert swift 2 to swift 4. If I open project on xcode 8.2.1 it shows 500+ error(after conversion). It also has multiple pod dependency and used google cloud messaging. I am in huge mess write now 
Im on iOS 11, in the simulator i get the video to work but the HTML in front of it dissapers
I noticed something strange in the conversion that Xcode 8.3 did... it added an additional param on a method the author wrote. It was the "Param: String" or something like that. Most conversions don't work well if there's a lot of changes. I don't envy you having to deal with pods and all the code in them. Have the authors of the code said they would update? If you're using after market code, someone else usually updates the code. I'm glad I skipped Swift 3 :D
Sorry to hear that! I would consider it as a bug. At this point, when the app is at 60% is trying to get all the likes from all the user's media. I will check it, thanks you for your time!
happy that you liked tutorial :)
Is using NotificationCenter observers good practice for this use case?
Yes? I mean, I wrote the code, so I think it's fine. Foundation only offers two implementations of the Observer pattern: Key-Value Observing and NotificationCenter. They both have their issues. I prefer NotificationCenter because it has fewer "abort" failure states and can pass arbitrary metadata about the change. Do you ask because of the common misconception that NotificationCenter is deferred or non-guaranteed delivery? Unless you ask for delivery on a specific queue, NotificationCenter delivery is an immediate invocation.
That use of NotificationCenter was a bit of a code smell to me too, though I didn't realise why until I continued further into the article and you started talking about leaky abstractions. The issue is that Notifications are by design available to your entire application. So in this case I definitely think KVO would be the better choice. Only things that know about Game can react to game state changes. You can scope and control what knows about Game to enforce this. As opposed to NotificationCenter, where it's easy forlike a SquareView to listen directly to notifications from the Game object 😱
Why not just try it and formulate an opinion? [Here's a quick app guide I wrote for RN.](https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies/bitcoin-ripple-ethereum-price-checker-with-react-native-redux-e9d076037092) ____ Both are good. RN is quicker to develop on but there's one big problem with RN. Apps that grow in complexity require you dig in (we call it "bridging code") native code (swift, java) -- at this point a BIG question arises--why not just write the app in native? This is currently the biggest problem RN faces--thanks to [expo](https://expo.io/) the RN community is about to make a MAJOR break through. Think of Expo as Rails for RN. 
Yours still pretty far off from anything I would consider a database. Key-value store, sure, database no. Your “sorted dictionaries” would be equivalent to an index in database-ese. Figure out how to perform a transaction and a join and you’ll get much closer. It’s non-trivial stuff though, so don’t expect it to be easy!
Someone is touchy. I'm a big proponent of MVC. I've managed numerous application development projects over the last decade. I've observed $100,000's of dollars in lost time and revenue because people break the rules the author is talking about. I've also watched as people try to save money by building a web app instead of native code for each platform and see the design and UI compromises that go with it. Considering this post is focussing on a native development language and the design guidelines for the platform, I was simply intending to emphasize his point. 
Notifications are scoped to the Game object. That Notifications have a feature where you can observe notifications for all objects is an irrelevant technical detail – it's not used here, nor would it cause any problems if it were. It certainly doesn't impact the leakiness of the abstraction since this the communicated information is the *external* data from the abstraction, not internal – the information is *deliberately* exposed. Yes, using Notifications for *internal* communication would be the wrong thing to do but that's not what's happening. As for KVO... it literally wouldn't work here without a redesign. The Square data is a struct, not a class, so you can't use KVO directly on it. Even if you changed to a class, you'd need to control mutability (to prevent Game changes via the Square objects) and you'd need to add observers for each property on each individual Square since there's no way to include metadata about *what* changed. Notifications include metadata. It makes them *far* more useful than KVO. If you still think it's weird to use Notifications in this way, I draw your attention to the NSManagedObjectContextDidSave notification (used to communicate changes at a context-level when Core Data is used as the model), UITextFieldTextDidChange notification (which is used to communicate changes to a specific UITextField with metadata about what changed), NSFileHandleDataAvailable (for reporting when you can read from an NSFileHandle) among others.
Actually, it seems like it's a problem with the Swift REPL in general, as I can reproduce this on the terminal.
https://www.udemy.com/swiftbirads/?couponCode=FREEBIRADS
&gt; Notifications are scoped to the game object Well, no. Literally anything can listen to your Game.changed notification. It becomes incrediby easy for someone to totally break the perfect MVC by just listening to your notification elsewhere. You’re making something effectively public and global when it should be internal and only received by your VC. Why not a delegate here, in lieu of KVO? One simple method gameDidChange, strongly typed, only received by the VC, with metadata about the change if needed. Your notification examples are all cases where the immediate owner of the originating object isn’t the only one concerned with the event. Different parts of your app that are totally disconnected might be interested in each of those. 
Requiring explicit @objc declarations was an intentional design decision in Swift 4: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0160-objc-inference.md The old way of marking everything that can be @objc as @objc automatically had a huge negative impact on binary size, and since binary size is a common complaint with Swift the core team decided that explicit @objc declarations only where needed are a better approach to this problem.

The Swift 2-&gt;3 conversion was implemented by shipping a specially modified copy of the Swift 2 compiler in the Xcode 8 release. Since the Swift 2 compiler is no longer maintained it is no longer shipped in Xcode 9.
Hey, I saved this a while ago and just had an opportunity to try it out today. I generated a couple of models for a project I'm working on and it saved me a ton of typing. Yay! I'm not a professional developer, I just dabble so I might be using it wrong but I'm having problems with nulls. Because let gettingStarted = GettingStarted.from(json: jsonString)! doesn't throw I don't know how to handle an error message from the api. If instead of expected data I get back a 404 and a message the app crashes with a fatal error unwrapping nil. What is the correct way to handle this? 
Try changing the last line to `return range != nil`
&gt; Literally anything can listen to your Game.changed notification. Yes, and that doesn’t matter because you don’t do it. In languages that do not provide, for example, private members of class instances, is there inherently a problem with leaky abstractions? No. The abstraction only leaks if you let it. Language features like private members and scoped notifications are merely guides for helping enforce good practices. They do not inherently confer any other benefit, and they only help if you use them and use them right. For example, having those features does not prevent people from writing leaky abstractions, or from abusing an already well-structured codebase. I’ve seen state and data repeater/bouncer methods written specifically to overcome language-enforced scope protections because the developer doesn’t have a good handle on the abstraction, or wants to do something that it hasn’t been designed to allow. So to recap, using unscoped or global NotificationCenter messaging is only a problem if you use it to abuse your abstraction. Just like public members are only a problem if you manipulate them directly to abuse your abstraction. There’s nothing inherently wrong with using them.
When they are asking me to describe my app’s architecture, I tell them how I always start and design an app. I like to sit down with pencil/paper and write down all the important parts that this app will require, and then I will always first think about the app’s model. What does the model do? What does it show? After having a good understanding of the app, If I am not sure how my screen should look, I would sketch on paper the UI look of the screen and write down whether this is like a tableview look with a navigation controller, and where the UI labels/buttons are positioned etc. You can go very into detail about the model and important factors of an app if they asked. 
I would suspect they are trying to ask what design patterns you are using. Sticking with MVC or trying flavour of the month MVVM or some other way of structuring you app. Have a read up on these. I've started adopting MVVM into my code as it is so much more testable.
Yes that too. I forgot to mention that. 
When you say model, do you mean? The data structure or the design pattern?
Why not MVP? They seem to identical
Should also talk about inheritance? If so, how to describe it?
MVP is achieved through delegation while MVVM is achieved through KVO. Both valid, pick your flavour. The interviewer would be testing you on knowing these things and have you tried them at all. I'm no expert in this and currently learning them myself.
Oh, I see. Thanks for making it clear.
That would probably be a separate question with regards to app architecture. I had one framed recently about Inheritance where I was asked about the difference between a class and a struct, in which a struct doesn't provide inheritance. 
I don't know something that is exactly like your request, but if you want a visual to go along with your database, you could look into Firebase. The way it shows your database comes as close to your request as I can think of. Good luck!
I am talking about the data structure. For example you are making an twitter app and want to post tweet messages on your news feed. Creating something like an Array of an Array of tweets would be nice because that way when working with something like a tableview, you can post messages and also order them in a section of like most recent tweets. The first Array would handle all the tweets messages, and then the second will handle sectioning them. 
 Thank you.
You can always omit the `!` and work with the optional value, for example to check it for `nil`: if let gettingStarted = GettingStarted.from(json: jsonString) { doWhatever(gettingStarted); } else { couldNotDeserialize(jsonString); }
 (range?.lowerBound)! What's the logic behind this?
I got it to work, the thing was to use NSString instead of String as String has similar method but not suitable for what I'm trying to accomplish here. Thanks for answers!
I'm trying to create a soundboard app with some drops, a few small audio clips, a tab to download and listen to podcasts, and a tab that links to a store. I also have zero experience coding, so it's pretty ambitious but I'm also taking my time and trying to make it worthwhile. Should be fun!
would be good to post what you got to so that others can use it as a reference
You'll have to describe what aspect of a database you're trying to replicate. This design has no page cache, no indexer or constraints, no query engine or optimizer, and no isolation or transaction mechanisms. It's just a data structure with some data in it. That's a perfectly valid thing to build but when somebody says they want a "database" it's probably not what they're talking about. There are small subsets of databases that can be useful to build, but I'm not sure what subset you're going for here -- an Array? At my university, introduction to database systems was a 400-level course. Postgres is over 1 MLOC, and even SQLite is over 100 KLOC. These are not simple programs. Even the toy database we wrote in a college semester was much more complex than the toy operating system we wrote. Without a proper page cache, for example, it's easy to blow out your RAM creating indexes, and then they hurt performance, and you'd have been better off just doing full table scans (and good databases know when to do this, anyway, because they can have better locality of reference). If you took away half the internals of Postgres, it might take you only half as long to write, but you wouldn't have 50% the performance -- maybe [1/10th](https://blog.pgaddict.com/file/pgbench-medium-ro-xeon.png) or less. 
You can't really. NSSelectorFromString is inherently an Objective-C runtime operation, explicitly marking your function as @objc is as Swifty as you're going to get. If you're the only one calling these methods then you might be able to replace the selectors with keypaths, but usually these kinds of methods are being used by Cocoa in some way,
A new app that incorporates IOS 11 tech **Dog Identifier**- it is a dog breed identification app that uses your phone's camera to instantly identify the breed of a dog. App Store Link: [Dog Identifier](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dog-identifier-dog-id-camera/id1286967051?mt=8) Using new Vision and Core ML API, Dog Identifier it the fastest and most accurate dog identifier out there.
thanks I will check their website out.
Bash inheritance and talk about composition and the interviewers will likely like you ;)

I've used Dash before, I even purchased a license before it got taken out of the App Store and I lost it. It was great until I lost the license and started getting nagged to buy every minute. Is there any documentation available directly? Like Rust or Go's documentation?
Yes. Zeal: https://zealdocs.org/ I use it on linux with Sublime Text, but there is a Zeal extension to Vim.
I am not a software engineer, but there are whole books written about software architecture. The term 'architecture' simply refers to plan you are going to use to build the software. Kind of like buildings have an architect, large pieces of software can have whole huge blueprints written out for them. The most common architecture in ios apps is MVC because it is relatively simple and easy to follow. But there are other paradigms such as clean architecture, top-down, bottom-up, ect. Not sure how to help you for the interview, but it might be good to read up on other architectures and then be able to tell them why you chose MVC over something else. 
Mostly an interviewer wants to know how you separate the various parts of your app (UI, Communication, Data, Persistence). If you are doing all of these things in a UIViewController you don't have any architecture. If, however, you've separated these and use clearly defined interfaces to communicate between them then you've got an architecture (even if it doesn't fit into one of the named systems MVVM, Viper, MVP, MVC, etc). If I ask this question I don't want to hear the name of whatever architecture you are using, I want to hear how you separate things and why. And if you are going to tell me you use some named architecture, you'd better be able to tell me the pros &amp; cons of it and tell me why you chose that one.
As someone who asks this question quite a bit - We're looking for the general understanding of exactly how your app is composed. What is the design paradigm you're using? MVC? MVVM? Are there any relevant third party libraries you pulled in, or could have pulled in? What kind of backend services/architecture are you leveraging? Is this a standalone app that the user inputs all the data it ever uses into? Are you pulling data from a third party integration? Do you have a first party server spun up? Is that returning JSON or XML data? How are you storing data locally? CoreData? SQLite? PLists (dear god, no). Perhaps most importantly for me, as an interviewer, beyond just simple understanding of what you used - I want good justifications as to why you used it. What benefits and challenges did you have because of your chosen architecture, and what did you learn after the fact that might be useful for a future project? Typically I'll prod you for more if I felt you didn't expound on something enough, but on the base level you should hit those points to give a pretty satisfactory answer.
