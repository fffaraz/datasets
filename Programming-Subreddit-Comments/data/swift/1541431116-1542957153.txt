There is \`myOptional.map( { functionThatDoesNotAcceptAnOptional($0) } )\`, but that might not be what you want.
I think this is very unlikely to happen but you can always make a post on the swift forums for this. In the meantime you can use `map` and `flatMap` to do the same thing. let viewController: UIViewController? = nil viewController.map { otherViewController.present($0, animated: true) } // nothing happens let string: String? = "10" let int: Int? = string.map(Int.init) // int equals .some(10) It isn't very pretty, especially if the function's parameters do not match 1:1 with the variable, but I prefer it to extra if/guard statements and it makes it clear when the function will be called or not.
So if I have: func blahToString(blah: Blah) -&gt; String { // some crap that returns a String } let blahStr: String = blahToString(nil) what value should `blahStr` hold? Additionally, do you also feel that Swift should allow you to pass doubles into functions that take Int parameters, but only if the Double happens to be n integral value?
But `blahString` explicitly returns a `String`, not a `String?`. Basically, what you're asking for is for every type to automatically be wrapped in an optional with automatic unwrapping and chaining everywhere throughout the language.
The ? after x would transform the return type into an optional if it is not already one.
&gt; while append new object while append**ing*** a* new object &gt; It seems possible since read and write are actually operating on different memory address, right? It's deeper than that. Basically, no. Atomicity exists for a reason. 
Yes, but you are forcing me to change the type of my variable, `blahStr` into something it is not. That variable may be something you control, so you can change the type if you wish in your code, but why if you're passing that value into a third-party API? Now you're forcing optionals into their code that they didn't write to handle it. Or you could just use the `if let` or `guard let` constructs to control whether or not you make that function call and everybody stays safe and happy.
&lt;code&gt; /// Allows f(x)-&gt;b to become f(x?)-&gt;b? extension Optional { func ifNotNil&lt;U&gt;(_ f:(Wrapped)-&gt;(U?))-&gt;U?{ guard let nonNilSelf = self else{ return nil } return f(nonNilSelf) ?? nil } } let a:Int? = 4 let b:Int? = nil let theSum = a.ifNotNil{ sum($0,$0) } let theNilSum = b.ifNotNil{ sum($0,$0) } print("Sum: \(theSum.debugDescription) NilSum: \(theNilSum.debugDescription)") let theChainedSum = a.ifNotNil{ a in b.ifNotNil{ b in sum(a,b) }} print("Chained: \(theChainedSum.debugDescription)") &lt;/code&gt;
I wouldn't say it's unlikely, as it's already been pitched on the Swift forums and it's been met with a pretty warm response.
Show us some code. 
Because that's 6 additional lines? let result: String? if let x = x { result = function(x) } else { result = nil }
Why don't you just make blahToString return an optional from the get go?
I only count five additional lines there, two of which should be combined, and one of which is a single character. If you're so concerned with that extra vertical space, you can just do something like: let result = x == nil ? nil : myFunction(x) And you still don't need to break the type-system to do that.
Vector images?
First of all, 3 lines. It depends on the context, but I don't see why you need `else { result = nil }`. Or even 2 if using `guard let` is possible. Second, your way with passing optional parameter in function, that expects unwrapped one might lower code readability. Right now when I do it, compiler notifies me that getting optional value is an unexpected behaviour for function. In you case, it will just silently skip method execution which is, in my opinion, may lead to troubles. &amp;#x200B; And if you don't like `if let` constructions, why don't just make a function that takes and returns optional parameter? Like `func myFunc(_par: String?) -&gt; String? {` `guard let par = par else {.return nil }` `// do sth` `}` &amp;#x200B; `let result = myFunc(nil)` `let result = myFunc("Wrapped")`
&gt; Second, your way with passing optional parameter in function, that expects unwrapped one might lower code readability. Right now when I do it, compiler notifies me that getting optional value is an unexpected behaviour for function. In you case, it will just silently skip method execution which is, in my opinion, may lead to troubles. That would be solved by introducing the ?-postfix operator as OP suggests. let result = myFunction(x?) ^ 
Right. And you may very well have changed the type of `result` from `ResultType` to `ResultType?` by doing that. So what is my code supposed to do now that `result` has a `nil` value when I wrote my code to only ever deal with string values? I'm talking about a case like this: thirdPartyAPI.thing = function(x?) When ` thirdPartyAPI.thing` is not a optional value. What should that code do when x is `nil`?
I updated my post with an example, Thank you!
Well, I deleted the previous post message because after digging a lot I was able to discover that it is due "**attempt to write a readonly database**". I cannot solve that. I guess it is not a user permission because I have 2 programs that access the database, the 1st I can select/insert/update but the second will fail! I am using the same path for the database, which is to run into /Applications/MyApp folder. The 1st program that works very fine is a terminal based software and the second has a GUI with ViewController where the use should setup some fields. So far **I don't think** it is direct code related. Previously I made wrapper to access the SQLite functions but right now I have such code: var dataBase: OpaquePointer? var queryStatement: OpaquePointer? let databaseURL = URL.init(string: APP_DIR + "thedatabase.db")! let query = "UPDATE TABLE SET FIELD=value WHERE KEY=key" // any update if sqlite3_open(databaseURL.path, &amp;dataBase) != SQLITE_OK { print(info: "Error opening database") return } if sqlite3_prepare_v2(dataBase, query, -1, &amp;queryStatement, nil) != SQLITE_OK { let errmsg = String(cString: sqlite3_errmsg(dataBase)!) print("Error: \(errmsg)") return } // line below I got the error, when the Update statement is called if sqlite3_step(queryStatement) != SQLITE_DONE { let errmsg = String(cString: sqlite3_errmsg(dataBase)!) print("Error: \(errmsg)") } sqlite3_finalize(queryStatement) sqlite3_close_v2(queryStatement) Maybe the problem is with the application path, but I tried to move into user documents and the problem is the same. I read a lot of similar issues as [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1518729/change-sqlite-database-mode-to-read-write](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1518729/change-sqlite-database-mode-to-read-write) and the unique thing I can imagine could be the fact of the 1st program become the "owner" of the database, of there's some related to bundle configuration, which I dont know how to setup if that is the case. &amp;#x200B;
Will it crash or what? How do you see/get notified about errors it finds?
It will write to the log, and if you're using Xcode there is a checkbox to "Pause on issues" which will pause the debugger.

Bad bot &gt; Video unavailable &gt; The uploader has not made this video available in your country.
Are you so stupid that you can’t infer what he meant?
Wrap the alert action in a class, make the class conform to a protocol and inject the implementation in the places where you want to use it. When testing you can test with a mock implementation. The actual `UIAlertController` is untestable in unit tests, only UI tests help. What you can test is everything you set to it like the actions, title, message and style you are going to pass to the `UIAlertController`. enum AlertType { case blank } struct AlertSettings { let title: String let message: String let type: UIAlertType let actions: [UIAlertAction] } class AlertBuilder { func settings(for alertType: AlertType) -&gt; AlertSettings { } } The `AlertBuilder` is 100% testable.
Are you storing all the video on the client? Or if the button isn’t pressed is the footage discarded? If you are storing the footage locally, you’d be writing it to disk, not storing it in an array. Video takes up too much memory to store in RAM like that. In that case you’d want to look at a file format that allows concurrent read/write. If you aren’t storing any footage locally, you’d probably want to look at a stream processing technique that uses a buffer. When the user presses the button, you’d copy the buffer content into another data structure to process for uploading.
Generally modifying the length of something you're iterating over is a big no-no. You can do this in two steps: first loop through the array and store the items you want to append in a different array; then afterward use `array.append(itemsToAppend)`
Great! Thank you for your help, I'll try and implement this tonight and report back. 
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621452-children Apparently that array already exists since iOS 5. But it's not reserved, just an internal variable that already exists. 
Your app can pull from a blog RSS Feed.
There's a testing framework I found that adds a few `XCTest`-esque functions to help with unit testing. It has a few assertions that aim to assist with testing UIKit. You can find one that asserts that alerts are presented [here](https://github.com/metova/MetovaTestKit/blob/93b1057e01d0af955ab0b188b0664fcab2334321/MetovaTestKit/UIKitTesting/UIAlertControllerAssertions.swift#L43). Hopefully that can shed some light on some ways you can test various things. This is definitely an integration-style assertion that tests several things at once. If you want something more finer-grained, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.
I wrote a function `chain` that does this: public func chain&lt;I, O&gt;(_ input: I?, _ function: (I) throws -&gt; O?) rethrows -&gt; O? { if let input = input { return try function(input) } else { return nil } } Usage: let optionalResult = chain(optionalArgument) { someFunction($0) } I think this is more explicit than magically not calling the function if its argument is nil, while still being more compact than `if let`.
Odd, how did xcode 9 missed it, it compiled and worked great.
You rewrote the `map` function: let optionalResult = optionalArgument.map { someFunction($0) } 
This is what the flatMap example above does without force unwrapping
Lots of people don’t know about that use of map and flatMap
Hey, markicevic, just a quick heads-up: **remeber** is actually spelled **remember**. You can remember it by **-mem- in the middle**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up: Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word". You're useless. Have a nice day!
It's just a name, syntactic sugar. The API has been there all along, just the keyword that the swift compiler looks for has changed.
Cool but I'm not able to compile it. I'm seeing a podfile, so I'm guessing I've got to do a "pod install". It fails: Analyzing dependencies [!] Unable to find a target named `Swift CoderTests`, did find `Swift Coder`, `SavannaKit`, and `SourceEditor`. [!] Automatically assigning platform `osx` with version `10.12` on target `Swift Coder` because no platform was specified. Please specify a platform for this target in your Podfile. See `https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#platform`. 
Perhaps you've moved the code from a generic class to a viewcontroller? It should have warned you in some kind of way or you should have used override somewhere. Anyway it seems like you're duplicating functionality already in the UIViewController perhaps you can leverage it's default implementation?
How difficult is it to learn swift? An opportunity opened up to update/run an iOS app for my friends family restaurant. I’ve always been interested in getting into coding, so I plan on doing more than just that one app. Any info on good software to develop iOS apps with, tips, or any advice in general would be greatly appreciated! 
Optional map is definitely exactly what you want. Syntax being maybe a little ugly it gets better if you have a single argument function since you can just pass it in instead of opening up a closure.
How do I force a tableView.reloadData(). I have a table view sitting on my VC and an IBOutlet hooked up. What I am expecting is for the table view to refresh every time I add append an item to the cellData array. What happens is it only refreshes once the array is fully populated. numberOfRowsInSection gets called every reload but cellForRowAt only gets called at the very end. import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource { @IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView! var cellData = [Int]() override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() let max = 100000 while cellData.count &lt; max { print(cellData.count) cellData.append(cellData.count) tableView.reloadData() } } func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int { return cellData.count } func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell { let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath) cell.textLabel?.text = "\(cellData[indexPath.row])" return cell } }
same
Yes, it’s to show what it looks like when you get something wrong.
Change the target to SavannaKit, build, change the target to SourceEditor, build. Then you can build rge main Swift Coder target.
Writer of the article here. The hardest part of writing the article definitely was naming everything as it's basically a bunch of best practices I used for code I was writing for a few projects. For example the term MVVM has a lot of associations for people but then again what do you call a class that is a Model for your View? I would love to hear critiques on it from you.
Let me know how it went!
Firebase is free until you exceed a certain volume. If it’s a project for school you should be fine. You can always compress images too. I recommend firebase, but you can also do as other have suggested and pull from a url 
Interesting, the documentation pretends it's been like that since iOS 5. Good catch!
I looked it over. Looks like you are gonna be a very wealthy group when apple buys this to implement into Xcode natively.
How hilarious is it that it’s cAlled Sherlock, too?
Yeah I thought we already had the Great Renamification anyway a few cycles back anyway?
I think they just want to get as many little things like this the way they like while the language is still “new”. At least the upgrade helper thing in Xcode did basically all the work for you this time unlike during the 2.3 -&gt; 3 nightmare lol
This has replaced Reveal for me in most scenarios! You guys are absolute legends for this &lt;3
Congrats! It will be very helpful to me
Wow! This is amazing!
 I think it's a great idea, however I am curious why ProblemList.swift is your source file for problems. As more and more problems get added, this file is going to have even more lines of code. Do you have plans to migrate that at all? I see the purpose of your test case functions in there, I'm just wondering why that path was taken on it instead of pulling text from a file 
Dude, kudos, the thing is amazing. Seriously!
Ah I see. Makes sense!
Wow this look amazing. This for me was of biggest missing features in the iOS dev stack.

Looks great, I think it’s a mistake to call it Sherlock however. Have you not heard the phrase to be “sherlocked” with regard to the Apple Eco system? https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/amp/
Bad name choice, seeing how Sherlock is already trademarked by Apple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software) https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html
**Sherlock (software)** Sherlock, named after Sherlock Holmes, was a file and web search tool created by Apple Inc. for the PowerPC-based "classic" Mac OS, introduced with Mac OS 8 as an extension of the Mac OS Finder's file searching capabilities. Like its predecessor, it searched for local files and file contents, using the same basic indexing code and search logic found in AppleSearch. Sherlock extended the system by enabling the user to search for items through the World Wide Web through a set of plugins which employed existing web search engines. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/swift/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
it's unlikely that Apple would let you use that name on the app store. They had their own product called ["sherlock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software))

There is no right way. If it fits your use case, why not?! There's always sb to complain.
Love your website but the landing page gives me no indication to scroll down. I was looking elsewhere for information on the app. It wasn't until I hit something by accident that I saw there was more information below the blue/white curve.
Tried it out on a complex app of ours. Really, really cool. The thing that would make this absolutely amazing would be support for custom properties, even if it was just @IBDesignables. Is that something on your roadmap?
&gt;The only instance in which it won't restart, is if calls to pauseLayer and resumeLayer are imbalanced. If I pause the animation, then remove it, then try to start it up again it won't start. But that behaviour is expected, and it's easily fixed by adding a call to resumeLayer before adding a new animation. Could you explain this part to me? Why is that behavior to be expected? &amp;#x200B; I'm finding that what you said is exactly the issue. I can start-cancel before timer/animation is completed, then start again with no problem. I can also start then let timer/animaiton play out and then start again with no problem. &amp;#x200B; What I can't seem to do is start, pause one or more times, resume, cancel, and then start fresh again. And I"m not sure why. I uploaded my animation and timer code \[to github here\]([https://github.com/cluelessoodles/testtimer-copy](https://github.com/cluelessoodles/testtimer-copy)). Are you able to see any mistakes in how I've written this?
Does it work with programmatic views? 
Unless Apple buys it. 
[https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/)
It's expected because the call to `pause` sets the layer's `speed` to `0.0`. If you try to add an animation to the layer at this point, of course, it can't progress. Setting the layer's `speed` back to `1.0` allows the animation to continue (or start, depending on the circumstances). I've looked at your code, and the problem lies in the `runTimer` function. You need to move the call to `resumeLayer` out of the `if` statement. It's not getting called if you pause the animation, then quit, the start again. A `defer` statement solves the problem: func runTimer() { defer { resumeLayer(layer: circleWithProgressBorderLayer) } if isPaused == true { finishTime = Date().addingTimeInterval(-remainingTime) timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1.0, target: self, selector: #selector(updateTimer), userInfo: nil, repeats: true) } else if isPaused == false { finishTime = Date().addingTimeInterval(counter) timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1.0, target: self, selector: #selector(updateTimer), userInfo: nil, repeats: true) progressCircleAnimation(transitionDuration: counter, speed: 1.0, strokeEnd: self.completionPercentage) } } I don't want to confuse matters but, personally, I don't think pausing the animation by setting the layer's `speed` and `timeOffset` is a good idea. It's leaving your layer in an inconsistent state. Your layer is a model object that's *supposed* to reflect the state of the view that it backs. Left in this state, there will be inconsistency between the values stored in the layer model, and what is seen in the view. Further, you're also capturing the state in a variable of your own, `isPaused`, and there is inconsistency between that value and the actual state of the layer. And that's why I think it's a bad idea; inconsistency leads to uncertainty (and neither of those are a good thing). A better approach would be to remove the animation completely when it's paused. To make it appear to the user that it is paused, you'd simply need to calculate the progress at that point, and set the `strokeEnd` accordingly (remembering to disable implicit animation). circle.removeAnimation(forKey: "lineFill") let currentTime = CACurrentMediaTime() - animationStartTime let progress = CGFloat(currentTime / animationDuration) CATransaction.begin() CATransaction.setDisableActions(true) circle.strokeEnd = progress CATransaction.commit() The `animationStartTime` and `animationDuration` would, of course, need to be stored in variables when the animation is added. To resume, you'd add a brand new animation that animates strokeEnd from its current value, to its final value (in the remaining duration): let remainingDuration = animationDuration * (1.0 - circle.strokeEnd) fillLineAnimation.duration = CFTimeInterval(exactly: remainingDuration) ?? 1.0 fillLineAnimation.fromValue = circle.strokeEnd fillLineAnimation.toValue = 1.0 I know you want to write code, but I'd really recommend you take at least a few hours to research Core Animation. The book I recommend is "iOS Core Animation Advanced Techniques" by Nick Lockwood.
Since Apple‘s Sherlock was retired in 2007 and the company didn’t use the name for anything else since then (AFAIK), OP could perhaps make a case for [trademark abandonment](http://www.agtlawyers.com/losing-trademark-rights-abandonment/). However, I’m not a lawyer, and Apple’s legal funds are probably much larger than OP‘s - plus, they could always just quickly decide to slap the name on some minor existing functionality - so picking a different name might be an easier option.
[Hacking with Swift by /u/twostraws](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)
The Stanford iOS courses seem to be really good but I don't think they are for beginners
It depends on how you like to learn. If you're good with learning from a book I'd recommend going through apple's iBook "Swift programming language" which has already been linked in one of the comments. If you're like me and prefer learning from video's, you could start with some swift fundamental video's on Youtube. Personally I really got into it following one of the top rated Swift courses on Udemy. Most of the time these courses are on a 95% discount and you can pick up a 200 hour course for only €10, I thought it was worth mentioning.
I’ve been really enjoying this one.
Well even if it’s cheap I can’t afford it since I don’t have credit card...
Where can i get it? Is it free? It’s ok if it’s not for beginners.... I’m not that new on programming world I’ve learned another language before and I’d like to learn how to make iOS and macOS apps
OP isn’t asking a question. They linked an article and that is the title. I dunno... I appreciate the post.

This so this. This will teach you both some program skills and the language it self. If you know the basics of programing and algorithms then this is even better way to go. If you do not then I recommend that you do some basic computer science course that taught in something like python and then come back to the hacking with swift 
Wow thanks, I found it and looks almost exactly like what I want!
I know these two: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZL5AmwuwlA&amp;list=PL3d_SFOiG7_8ofjyKzX6Nl1wZehbdiZC_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71pyOB4TPRE&amp;list=PLPA-ayBrweUzGFmkT_W65z64MoGnKRZMq Yes, I'm not new to programming too but I felt that it's for who know more about the language. Good look on your studies =) 
Thanks a lot 👍🏻
That is exactly, what I wanted to suggest. :)
A code comment. I suggest removing the logic out of scrollViewDidScroll and use willDisplayCell, once it will display the last cell, load the next page. On a good network it allows for very smooth scrolling, on a slow network it will lazy load in the cells. &amp;#x200B; The API should tell you the number of pages, and the current page you will on if implemented correctly. &amp;#x200B; [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdelegate/1614883-tableview?language=objc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdelegate/1614883-tableview?language=objc) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
If you to get something up and running quickly then do it in Corona SDK. Unless you want to use it as a learning experience for Swift, then don’t.
Thanks everyone for your support and help. Sorry I haven't been super responsive, life got a bit busy and I haven't been able to get to my computer the last few days. I'm going to try again tonight. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Awesome! Thank you so much, like I said in my update post I'm hoping to be able to take a crack at this tonight. &amp;#x200B; I really appreciate it. 
A jigglypuff as seen from above!
Thank you very much! Well, now I can reach the application directory, but the main question still persists: my \*other\* software will be able to read write there? getting the directory I got: /Users/thatsme/Library/Containers/com.myapp.test/Data/Library/Application Support/Test Will the test2 be able to read right there, as for it the path will be different?
After learning swift language start learning the Apple APIs like UITableView, UICollectionView and so on. If you want to build more complex apps, concepts like networking and working with databases are also essential. But for starters stay with the UIViews and create simple apps to familiarise yourself with the Apple environment. 
So assuming UIViews is an Apple API, how I’m looking at it now is: The entirety of the swift language besides the basics are a bunch of APIs. So there’s an API for databases, different views, networking, etc. Is it safe to assume that? Or am I missing something?
Many of the APIs are written in Obj-C and some in Swift. To be able to write any app you have to be able to use the APIs that you get access to from XCode. The best way to understand is to dive in headfirst and make and app. If you’re not at that level I’d recommend referring any online tutorial. Ray Wenderlich on Udemy was a great help to me. 
I get your example. So you’re saying that if we breakdown all the basic components of apps. They boil down to the same parts and pieces unless you’re creating something specialized. My question is, after putting those pieces together, what about customization? Customizing those features like the back button and others from a design that I’ve composed? (By customization I mean design, not features)
I’ve seen people recommend this. And I’ve started building my personal app, but right now at this point, I don’t know what unit testing is and what adding core data into the project does. Can I add those into the project later? Or would I have to start from scratch? I know my app isn’t going to be perfect, but knowing gives me some reassurance.
Thanks for your input.
That's one type of iOS but, by far, not the only one. Many iOS apps never make a web request or parse JSON.
Using the Application Support directory, even through the request to NSFileManager, is not sufficient for sandboxed Mac apps (required for the Mac App Store or if you enable sandbox for Developer ID for things like Mojave Notarized apps). Under sandboxing, every app gets its own isolated file container subdirectory which includes a separate isolated Application Support directory. This will prevent you from accessing it. Instead, you need to use [App Groups](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW19) which is intended for your exact use case of a developer that makes multiple apps that need to share data files. You will need to setup the correct entitlements, and then *"Your app can obtain the path to the group containers by calling the containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: method of NSFileManager."* 
Nice!!! Maybe I should use localdomainmask because the software will run as an agent/daemon. Well, I am dealing with now the database path not being unwrapped :( it returns nil, maybe something with the / slashs /, I dunno. URL.init(String: dbpath) will return nil.
Do you have any other programming experience? Or are you starting from scratch?
Kind of. Building an iOS app and the Swift language are two different things. Swift an be used to make things other than mobile apps! Stuff like classes, structure, functions, ints, and strings are part of the Swift language. Stuff like UIViews and UITableViews are part of a framework called UIKit, created by Apple. You can think of a framework as a toolbox full of preconstructed tools to make your life easier when making an app. Anyone can make a framework, but Apple already supplies you with the most crucial ones. But yeah, you can think of app building (and honesty, programming in general) as glueing a bunch of framework tools together (such as UIViews) in such a way that makes a functional app. :) you’ve discovered the secrets of programming!
Ooooh finally something I can answer. Like you I’d been learning swift for a little over a year and wondering how exactly it translates into an app. I’m one month into a coding boot camp and because of doing daily projects building apps, it’s finally clicked for me. Basically, first you learn swift. Then, you have a rough (or detailed) idea for your app. Then you open Xcode and in Xcode you design each view of your app based on what it does as the user uses the app. (A view is each page of your app that is visible as you use an app e.g the Facebook homepage in your Facebook app is a “view”) E.g UITableView is a type of view that’s good for displaying lists or other kinds of information you’d usually find in tables. When you’re done arranging the different elements that make up each view (like buttons, text, etc), and when you’re don’t arranging the different views that make up your app (like profile page, home page, etc), you connect each “view” to a code file called a “controller”, and inside each controller file, you connect each element (like your buttons or text etc) to a particular piece of code inside your controller file. And that file is where you write the Swift code that will make the visual elements of your app work. You can start by trying to make the most basic of apps, one that says Hello World when you click a button. It’s very basic but once you understand the relationship between the swift code and the interface, the lightbulb comes on and you’ll be happy about learning to do more and more things. 
I would upvote a million times if I were able to. This is exactly what I needed thank you so much.
See. Now UITableView makes sense. If I’m understanding it correctly it’s just something that’s already been done for you. Instead of trying to create a table or list from scratch you can use the table view as a starting point!
Thanks I do have one more question. So I understand that for buttons and other components on each view has its own code and I will have to connect it using the code file. But what about the code for the logic that is used for authentication, sign ups, and settings go? Would the authentication logic go in the same file as as the login view controller? And the logic for sign ups for the sign up view controller? Just to clarify I don’t mean the logic as in the buttons and form validation (making sure the email has @gmail.com/@yahoo.com OR making sure the password is at least 6 characters long). What I mean is the “business logic” or the logic that tells the user “That email address is already being used by another account!”. It might be way over my head but even a general explanation will help. Thanks so much!
Yes, so say you want to make a ToDo list app. The first obvious thing when you think of such an app is a list. That means the first "view" is going to be a list. Now, the default view you get in Xcode is just a UIView. This is your regular plain blank page. Technically, you can use this blank page and create a list in it from scratch, but should you? No. Why? Because Apple has already given you another type of "view" that is perfect for lists. So the first step of your ToDo list app would be to delete that regular UIView that appears once you open Xcode, and replace it with a UITableView. Then you go through the process I described before hooking up your code to the view.
You’re wonderful lol. Now it makes complete sense. UITableView and other APIs are “shortcuts” that help you get things done faster. That allow you to not “build it from scratch”.
Check this out: https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316 By the time you finish this free course, you will have developed several apps from beginning to end.
Thanks. Looks like I’m nowhere near that yet. But thank you so much for your explanations. It helped me out without a doubt.
Yeah, no problem
By any chance could you tell me the name of the boot camp that you’ve been with?
Oh sorry just re-read your question. Yes, the code that will display to the user "Sorry, this email is already taken" will go in the view controller file that controls the Sign Up page view. It's the code that actually signs the user up / logs the user in that I don't know yet.
I'm doing Lambda School. It's pretty intense but I've learned so much so far.
It came together for me when I realized I can quickly build up an app if I’m given a UI design. I highly recommend doing tutorials by Brian Voong aka LetsBuildThatApp. 
I like his videos, but they are way too advanced for me. I understand, “Then learn the basics, build some basic apps...”, but what I was looking for the more detailed and theoretical bridge between the basics and the things that I want to build. I don’t think the problem is “where and who to learn from”, but if it makes sense to me.
I can see that. Have you had prior programming experience before? I was a junior in college as a computer science major when I started watching his videos 
Good call, I wasn't considering sandboxing.
You’re awesome at explaining, I must say. You sound like a teacher.
Lol, my first thoughts, the difference is that Sherlock just got copied and Apple didn't buy anything.
This can potentially save us hours and hours! Most of my recompiles is to test little GUI differences, this changes a lot!
TL;DR - If you're just learning and the app is small, there's no harm in shoving all your code into a View Controller. The file may just become hard to maintain eventually with all that bloat. If you're interested in an example of a big production app's architecture, keep reading! I'm kind of in the process of re architecting a terrible codebase right now and I'm addressing a lot of the questions that you're asking within my own project. I wish the contractors that wrote our app had the same foresight haha. That being said, you probably don't need to worry too much about proper architecture or encapsulation at this stage in your learning. #justdoit Generally, View Controllers should only do one thing: Control the presentation of views. All business logic should be moved to some sort of different file with as different purpose. It's incredibly easy to stick everything inside of your view controllers... until it's not. View controllers should be pretty small in an ideal world. I can lay out a basic example of how I've decided to restructure my app's login page. You have to do a few things under the hood when you log a user in. You need to... 1. Validate inputs before sending anything to the server. 2. Send credentials to the server (async network request) 3. If you're using OAuth2, for example, you'll need to save a successful response token to some secure data store on the device. This has to also be done asynchronously because you don't want to block the UI for an expensive operation. This token will get sent with every subsequent authenticated request. 4. Display loading indicators while the network request/data store 5. Display error / success message 6. Navigate to the next view after a successful login In programming, there is a concept called the "single responsibly principle". It basically says that one file/class/struct/function should really only do ONE thing. Things get confusing fast if they try and do more. Keeping that in mind, and also how we've already established that View Controllers _should_ only manipulate views, we need different classes for points 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1. Make a tiny class or struct that _just_ takes in a user name and password and tells you if they're valid or not. This class doesn't know about UIKit (which is super helpful when starting to write unit test, but that can come later. If you're interested, look up Test Driven Development and follow a guide that uses Swift as an example). As you'll soon find, proper validation can be pretty complicated. You'll be glad that you have a class that does one thing - validates inputs. It's easier to digest mentally. You're separating business logic from View Controller logic here, and that is a wonderful thing. 2. Your network layer. Make a class that makes async network requests and returns either "all good", or "error", with an error message. It doesn't do anything else. It just takes inputs (username and password) and then knows how to ask the server to authenticate. If we continue using the OAuth2 example, the "Good" response will likely return a token as well. 3. Data Storage layer - This class's responsibility is interacting with persistent storage. This will take an OAuth token and save it to some data storage, as well as read it back. Which storage method you use can be a whole other post. 6. Navigation - View Controllers totally can do navigation using segues, and this is probably what apple will tell you to do, but segues isn't very scalable in large apps. I've spent the past two weeks detangling a huge web of storyboard segues in preparation for adding a tablet mode to our app. It's been a nightmare. I prefer some other class to do the navigation instead. If you're a beginner like yourself though, just use storyboard segues. They're easy and you'll understand what's happening quickly. Now, back to your original question: How does it all tie together? What does all this business logic? Where does it happen? My answer has been a design pattern called the Coordinator Pattern. All that a coordinator really is, is a class that holds all of the needed dependencies and makes decisions based on user input for a particular flow of an app. Just defined something like `class AuthCoordinator {}`. It's not an apple framework or anything, just a regular old custom class. So let's run through a full example of what the "AuthCoordinator" might look like: App starts. We initialize an auth coordinator because the user isn't logged in. This auth coordinator requires a few things in order to auth a user - network requests, database writing, and input validation. Luckily, we made classes for each of these requirements (or _dependencies_). We pass these into the auth coordinator through a custom initializer (`init()`) and the coordinator holds onto a reference to each. It can call each of them when needed. This is called dependency injection. It sounds like a fancy concept, but that's literally all it is. Then the auth coordinator creates and pushes our login view controller onto the navigation stack. So the user types some stuff in to the username and password fields and hits the login button. It is tempting to write the code to validate the credentials right in the view controller, but don't do that. This is what the coordinator is for. The VC tells the coordinator that the user tried to login with a username and password through something called delegation. The delegate pattern is something you should get familiar with when working in iOS. We will say that the VC can only tell the Coordinator that a user tried to login with username/pass, and conversely, we will say that the coordinator can only tell the VC if a login failed, and why. You can add code in the view controller to hook into the user tapping on the login button using something called an IBAction. In that code block, the view controller will display a loading indicator, and then tell the coordinator that the login button was pressed with X username and Y password. Nothing else! Now is the coordinator takes control and decides what to do (business logic). The coordinator calls a method on the input validator class that it is holding a reference to, in order to check if these credentials are even worth sending to the server. If not, the Coord tells the VC that the login failed because the credentials are bad. If so, the VC removes the loading indicator and displays a UIAlert with the error message. Maybe it also clears out the username and password text field. Notice how the VC is only manipulating views? If the credentials are worth sending, the coord then instead calls upon its trusty network interaction class. It tells the class to try and auth with the server using X credentials. Same story. If it failed, tell the VC and give a helpful message. VC can then display the message. If the server says the creds are good, it returns an auth token that needs persisting because you are about to make more network requests using it. The coordinator then knows to call the database class to save the token. If that fails, again, tell the VC with a helpful error message and remove the loading indicator. If allll these don't fail, the user is successfully authed! Now we know to display the next view controller. The coordinator instantiates your home screen and pushes it onto the navigation stack. We're authed! Since all of the components relevant to logging in existed outside of the ViewController, we can easily write unit test for them as well! (different topic) There are million different ways to structure your code. The coordinator pattern is one of them. You're essentially creating an API for your View Controllers to talk to when the user does something. A few other patterns that address the same problems are VIPER, MVVM, uh... that's actually all that I can think of off the top of my head haha. Hope this helps!
Sir I need to buy you a drink. This is what I’ve been searching for that no one seems to search for. “Production App Architecture” Realistically, I need time to dissect and look up all the terminology, but regardless, this is pure gold. Off topic follow up question: Why don’t more experienced developers explain concepts, like this, with full production app as examples? Or maybe I’m not swinging on the correct vine?
I find the best way to approach it is to treat Swift as a language. If you were heading out of the country and needed to learn another language, while you may study the basics, there might be some things you focus on. Greetings, questions you know you’ll have to ask, etc. In the same way, focus on what you’re wanting to create. You can learn the basics of Swift, but you’ll eventually need to focus on learning what you need to learn to accomplish your purpose. For instance, if you need to make a table, how do you do that with the iOS SDK? Or if you need to pass data between two view controllers, maybe brush up in delegation. You’ll never know everything. And you’ll never have it all in your head. Even senior developers use Google and Stack Overflow. The skill of a senior is not asking less questions, it’s knowing the right question to ask. 
Stack Overflow, Google, andddddd REDDIT! Everyone has helped me so much.
I already write little journal entries from what I’ve learned that day. Maybe once I get to that point (someday), I might do that. I think it may help a lot of people. But when you say the high level articles start making sense later, I completely agree. When I was coding in JavaScript, I found a lot more Medium articles start to digest easier. Just having asked this question might even help people searching for this exact and really really specific question. *I’m in New York, but keep in contact and when I’m there I’ll owe you one!
Only nit-pick here is that UITableView and other Swift "things" aren't APIs, they're called Frameworks. In case you're curious what an API really is, or where you might find an example of an API, please read on. -------- **An API** is basically some data hosted by anyone other than yourself which you can read or write using code that asks the API for a specific piece of data from their larger set of data. A very *very* simple API might look like this Bitcoin price tracking API, which is essentially just a web page accessed by a simple URL: https://www.bitstamp.net/api/v2/ticker/btcusd. That URL will always return the current price of Bitcoin, and by modifying the URL, you can customize your **API call** to request different types of data from different crypto currencies. Using this Bitcoin API example, if you were to change the 'btcusd' portion of the URL to 'ethusd', you would then be able to make an API call to retrieve the price of Ethereum instead of Bitcoin. Some APIs might allow you to read data like this, while others might allow you to write data as well. Facebook and Google have literally hundreds of APIs that developers can use for free, and when you get to that point of complexity, you start looking into or using "SDK"s which are basically just a collection of smaller, more specialized APIs. I hope this information can help you more accurately research these types of questions.
`blahStr` won't hold anything, because your code won't compile. It'll say `Value of optional type 'Optional&lt;String&gt;' must be unwrapped to a value of type 'String'`.
While this is convenient when writing code, I'm not so sure it's a good idea for when reading code. As is, when I read `let x = foo(...` I know that foo will be executed. With your proposal, I have to scan all parameters of foo for a trailing `?`. This feature would lead to a lot of confusion during debugging (missing a `?` somewhere in the parameters, and then going "What the hell, why did the debugger just skip that function call?!?"). The `x?.m()` syntax is better, because the question mark happens before the method call, so I see that `m` might not be called right away. Maybe you can think of some syntax, but for now, I like `x.map { $0.m() }'.
Should be `myFunction(x!)`, which makes this a little more unpleasant. Better use `x.map { myFunction($0) }`.
You need the `else { result = nil }` if you want to use `let`; alternatively, you could use `var result: String? = nil`. (Neither of which are very concise).
I have finished my game recently using SpriteKit and swift. Check it out here: [Spinnit](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/spinnit/id1437736129?mt=8) 
You need to encode it to data. If you use Swift you can use Encoding: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) If you use Objective-C you can use NSSecureCoding: [https://nshipster.com/nssecurecoding/](https://nshipster.com/nssecurecoding/)
I would look at serialisation, specifically the Codable protocol. If you conform your class to Codable (and all it’s properties are Codable) then you can serializable that class to disk
Anyone is using any DI framework? I always end up manually passing all instances to ViewModels and not using automatic segues for pushing/presenting new VCs. 
how to set up* Setup is a noun. Set up is a verb. Words! How do they work?!
This is what you want - UserDefaults should only really be used for settings / preferences.

I use my own approach similar to composition in the article. On the other hand, all of my dependences are static property. Global constants and variables are computed implicitly lazily so my approach looks like this: class Dependencies { static let requestManager = RequestManager() } For me it’s cleaner than this one: class Dependencies { lazy var requestManager = { ..... }() } Less code - same result. 
Ok, thanks... I noticed in the JSON there's a \`num\_results\` member, is that where I need to be specifying the number of results I want at a time? Or is that just the amount of results total in their API? &amp;#x200B; I'd link the JSON in quicktype.io but it can't read the JSON.. this is the url: &amp;#x200B; [https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/home.json?q=new+york+times&amp;page=2&amp;sort=oldest&amp;api-key=1278dc0b6c094c40939555d787cc1c00](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/home.json?q=new+york+times&amp;page=2&amp;sort=oldest&amp;api-key=1278dc0b6c094c40939555d787cc1c00) &amp;#x200B; And there's an example of how the JSON looks [here](http://developer.nytimes.com/top_stories_v2.json#/Console/GET/%7Bsection%7D.%7Bformat%7D). &amp;#x200B; [The readme](https://developer.nytimes.com/top_stories_v2.json#/README) for the API doesn't seem to say anything in terms of limiting the number of results, is it just not possible with the New York Times API? In the URL I have above, there's \`page=2\` and \`sort=oldest\`, maybe I need to alter one of those? Again I can't find anything on that in the readme..
Haha now my turn to say thank you! I learned something new!
my recommendation is to just start making a game and look up how to do the specific tasks you need. you can approach the same game many different ways and tutorials don't really teach you how to problem solve. so basically start programming, run into problem, try and solve the problem, if you are stuck look up for possible solutions, continue programming. also i didn't find spritekit to be easier than scenekit. 
So I searched quite a bit. The answer is no you can't change the number of results returned for `top stories`. If you need to get an idea of pagination see the article search api. [http://developer.nytimes.com/article\_search\_v2.json#/Documentation/GET/articlesearch.json](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/Documentation/GET/articlesearch.json) In the details you can see **page** which says *"The value of page corresponds to a set of 10 results (it does not indicate the starting number of the result set). For example, page=0 corresponds to records 0-9. To return records 10-19, set page to 1, not 10."* So `article search` has pagination option (although restricted to 10) but `top stories` doesn't. As I said the backend should provide support.
Not sure how this is related to Swift at all. But anyway, iTunes has the ability to select multiple items and then modify some attributes on all of them. You should just be able to select all your Audiobooks and mark them as music files.
Hey, they learned!
So I've changed it up a bit, I'm using the article search and I'm establishing the url like so, with string interpolation for the page: &amp;#x200B; var page = 0 let jsonUrl = URL(string: "[https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=new+york+times&amp;page=\\(page)&amp;sort=oldest&amp;api-key=1278dc0b6c094c40939555d787cc1c00](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=new+york+times&amp;page=\(page)&amp;sort=oldest&amp;api-key=1278dc0b6c094c40939555d787cc1c00)")! &amp;#x200B; Then when \`fetchMoreStories\` is called (when the user reaches the bottom of the page), I increment the page by 1: &amp;#x200B; func fetchMoreStories() { fetchingMore = true // Fetch more stories fetchData(url: jsonUrl) { (result : FetchResult&lt;Status&gt;) in page += 1 switch result { case .success(let object): self.storyData = object.response.docs case .failure(let error): print(error) } DispatchQueue.main.async { self.tableView.reloadData() } } } &amp;#x200B; But I'm getting an error when I establish the url "Cannot use instance member 'page' within property initializer; property initializers run before 'self' is available" &amp;#x200B; I understand why it's not working but I can't figure out a way to get around it - am I on the right path with this approach i.e. using interpolation in the url and incrementing the page every time \`fetchMoreStories\` is called?
I have a function called `acquire` that works very differently based on the parameter it is given. Each parameter it supports effectively has to run a different function. Using nested functions here would result in an extremely long file that would need to be recompiled often, so I’d rather have this split into files. &amp;#x200B; Unfortunately, you can’t extend functions. Is there a way to make these functions “private”, while making them accessible to `acquire`? The `fileprivate` access level is very nearly the behavior I want. &amp;#x200B; Should this be a module or something? If so, how would I implement it?
Are the parameters different types? This seems more like you want a protocol and to have each type specify their behavior. Or you probably want to overload `acquire`.
&gt;Saklad5 Each parameter is the same type. Long story short, `acquire` takes a dictionary literal as input, using a special `Int` enumeration as the key and another Int as the value. &amp;#x200B; Each case of that enumeration prompts different behavior.
Because, in iOS, there is only one window — which is what the whole app is in. The cell wouldn’t contain a window, the window would contain many sub views, one of which would be your cell Can I ask, why are you trying to access the window?
One Swift thing out of a half dozen others. And it's a very simple language feature, [specifying argument labels](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID167). It's so simple that here's the entire topic from the official [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html): --- ###Specifying Argument Labels You write an argument label before the parameter name, separated by a space: func someFunction(argumentLabel parameterName: Int) { // In the function body, parameterName refers to the argument value // for that parameter. } Here’s a variation of the greet(person:) function that takes a person’s name and hometown and returns a greeting: func greet(person: String, from hometown: String) -&gt; String { return "Hello \(person)! Glad you could visit from \(hometown)." } print(greet(person: "Bill", from: "Cupertino")) // Prints "Hello Bill! Glad you could visit from Cupertino." The use of argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive, sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable and clear in intent. --- Hardly worth an article, don't you think?
Educated guess: because the cell, and therefor neither the contentView nor your subview were added to a window yet, i.e. because they aren't currently displayed by the system.

Looks like a solid, informative article. I particularly like the use of key paths, they seem to simplify the code quite a bit.

Same. Each VC has its own VM. Then we use a flow controller to take care of navigation presentations. 
iOS is easier for webdevs than it was...but native app development is still going strong. Doing *some* web development, especially back end development around APIs and HTTP, is excellent training for longterm mobile development. Much of the difficult parts of iOS development is dealing with API related concerns. 
Don't follow the money, follow what makes you happy. 
this is probably the best advice ever given on here.
Hmmm TIL
thanks, IT recruiter...
Senior Mobile Engineer ;) 
I'd look into pwa dev, although, as long as Apple pumps out new phones with new features, native apps will live. Most client apps could be replaced by pwas, but Apple is geting more strict every year, we are lucky to have our web wrappers in the store, have to fight Apple with every release, and it's a status symbol (and step 0 in marketing) to be represented in the store. So yeah, client apps might switch to pwas, but you can't tell management Apple won't let that experience on the store...
great advice from someone with triple the salary.... :)
@fluchtpunkt knows his shit
I have a friend who went from knowing nothing to building apps to submit to the App store with his cousin, who was also learning Swift, in a matter of 3 months. In fact his first job that's he's still at now is with Disney making kids games on iOS platform. He says Ray Wenderlich is why he got his job with Disney. I'm going through his course now and I'd highly recommend doing a monthly subscription for his content. It's always up to date and you find tutorials on there for stuff that no one else is doing, like how to make those Snap filters. He also has ebooks, and while they're pricey, I find that they're written very well and more like he's talking to you rather than you reading a text book. Very worth it. I'm learning from the Swift ebook (as recommended by my friend) and will work through the iOS ebook next while making small projects on the side.
I thought the same but I’m switiching the root VC, presenting the VC, adding CollectionView and then setting the datasource. I’ve never had this problem before.
From the error, it sounds like the problem’s with the second and third lines. Replacing them with `var name = “Tim McGraw”` should fix it up, but I’m on mobile so I can’t verify. 
Where do you create ViewModels for new screens? In VCs, VMs or in flow controlller? Who calls push to new VC? Do you keep track of “current” view controller in your flow controller? 
I changed it to var name = "Tim McGraw" and var age = 25 now the error is on var latitude and longitude, what is the point of a tutorial if it is an error on my program but its typed 100% exactly the same as they have it. 
Yeah, latitude and longitude will have the same problem: making a variable without giving it an initial value. Swift has been quite a fast growing programming language, so tutorials can quickly become outdated. Don’t expect to be able to follow them 100%, but the compiler errors should be helpful in nudging you along.
Flow controller creates VMs. Flow controller pushes and pops the VCs. I think the idea is that we don't want the view controllers to know about each other. So if you wanna change the order of the screens you don't have to look very hard for the code that does that. And you could also test which button takes you to different screen that way. This would be a more detailed explanation http://merowing.info/2016/01/improve-your-ios-architecture-with-flowcontrollers/ 
Hacking with Swift says "Learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift 4.2 Tutorials"

Hi bcornello! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/swift) if you have any questions or concerns.*
It is fully updated for Swift 4.2, and the tutorial is correct. The problem is that Swift's behavior has changed here: the old code used to be fine, and still is fine if you're building a regular app, but it's now no longer fine in playgrounds. I tried to cover both bases by adding this text right there on the page /u/HeadlineINeed was reading: "In real app projects – as opposed to playgrounds – that works just fine, because Swift knows what type of data `name` will hold in the future. Playgrounds are a slightly special case, so you’ll still get an error in the playground." You can find it here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/3/types-of-data However, quite a few people have missed that message, so clearly I need to re-think my approach! I think I'll maybe make it bold, or reword it to be much more blunt. In practice, though – i.e., in real apps – being able to delay giving constants and variables a value is very commonly used, so I do need to cover it somewhere.
How much experience do you have in Swift? Gain general purpose language experience, and then... just try and make a game? Learn SpriteKit and GameplayKit as you go. I’d never made a game before - not a relatively simple text-based game in Python, nor a 3D game in Unreal or Unity - but for my undergrad. dissertation, I decided to recreate the Pokémon battle engine. So I just... got started? I created the basic data model for the bits I *knew* would be necessary (e.g. a Pokémon has a species, and a species has set base stats), but when it came to the game logic I just made logical guesses at how to solve the problem, checked to see if my idea worked, and refined it as necessary. Find a game you want to create - something simple like Tic-Tac-Toe - and try to work out how to build it.
I have found a fix for the issue, not sure if you want to upload the page but here is it.. &gt;I also noted this new behavior in the release version Xcode 10. More specifically, in a playground, if you enter something like: var myInt: Int you will see this error printed in the debug area: error: variables currently must have an initial value when entered at the top level of the REPL var myInt: Int ^ The error only occurs when you have a playground set to “Manually Run” (which I believe is the default “Execute Playground” option for a newly created playground in Xcode 10). If you change the “Execute Playground” option to “Automatically Run” the above code will be accepted and you will not get the error. You can choose the “Execute Playground” run option by a click-and-hold on the triangle (run) icon at the top left of the debug area (which is at the bottom of the playground window).
Maybe move the code to a class instead of top level.
Thanks, but I have a job.
I’ve been writing swift since it came out. Swift is pretty easy to get, but I think it’s cocoa touch that will take awhile to ‘come together’. I mean there is UIKit, CoreData, CoreAnimation, and the vast Foundation interface, all of which help you to develop apps. swift itself is a small part of writing an app. If you have a potential idea for an app, I would dive into parts that you definitely know you’re gonna need. Say maybe it’s displaying a list of restaurants. Or it’s talking to a Bluetooth device. Don’t worry about getting it ‘right’. If it works for your app, that’s all you need. 
&gt; Yeah, latitude and longitude will have the same problem: making a variable without giving it an initial value. That's shitty. You can't declare a variable then without giving it a value. In Obj-C, each variable was nil when initially declared. 
No. That's the point. And it promotes the correct way to do it, rather than the fuck-up.
It's a problem specific to this version of Playground. Not swift in general
There's now a released version of my app for practicing Swift! You can try it out without having to compile it yourself. If anyone tries it out, please let me know what you think! [Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/YCLQaQy) [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9umfs7/swift_coder_swift_practice_problem_app/)
I think I've fixed this, you should be able to just build it now. Also there is now an already compiled version available under releases.
Neat game. Does it have sounds or music?
Name sounds familiar. Didn’t you have a movie countdown app before?
I did! I have a lot of projects that I work on off-and-on. One day I will finish updating my countdown app to fix some crashes and update the APIs.
Of course but I can see the collection view, the cell and still the window of the view inside the cell (which is also visible) is nil.
I wanted to use AMPopTip in my project as well but it keeps making weird stuff I don' want to happen. Like if I show it with a custom view the custom view has a whole other frame than the poptip. Also I have two Buttons in the custom view, but their targets are never called even though I followed all the steps from the github issue that said to disable the dismissontap. Since you used this library as well, maybe you have any ideas? And I know I'm a little late to the party.
Wowza stream engine? 
I am learning Swift, right now creating a macOS software and after finished I will start an iOS application. I already made android and iOS apps but using Delphi which is far more productive and faster, but for a job reason I will need to use Swift now. Maybe working with macOS could cut a way out for iOS with Swift. Thanks and I will try your app. 
 man mv
A great way to end up poor. 
I like your style. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks a ton 
Since you've already answered your own question I think it's OK to close this topic
FYI and IMHO: That's a poor reason to use subclassing. It doesn't allow you to mix-and-match when appropriate. Better would be to make an extension: extension UILabel { func withHeaderStyle() -&gt; UILabel { self.textColor = ThemeManager.currentTheme.palette.primary self.font = ThemeManager.currentTheme.textStyle.headerText return self } } Then at point of use: var titleLabel = UILabel. withHeaderStyle() You can make several of these "withXStyle" methods and at the point of use you can chain them together. That's something you can't do with inheritance. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/iosprogramming] [What are various red flags for you in Swift code reviews?](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/9vkavb/what_are_various_red_flags_for_you_in_swift_code/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
This is why I don’t hire anyone. My code would be considered workplace abuse.
Actually, looks like I’m ok on most of this. But I can’t guarantee I conform to standards and my notes even take me a minute. 
This is correct. I will add that writing your own MyLabel class as a UIView subclass is also very easy - just a String and two methods, I think - drawInRect and sizeThatFits . We did this for labels to vertically align text better among other things. Unlike many 3rd party UILabel subclasses, our code has been stable for years because it doesn’t rely on undocumented features of UILabel. 
Thanks I'll check it out.
Will check it out, thanks
Projects that do not compile.
Use of "!" optional unwraps. They should be rare and carefully considered, not sprinkled on everywhere. 
Using dictionaries, especially when the value type is Any or AnyObject. At times they are necessary, but more often than not you can define a new type without too much trouble. 
What do you mean by the image is zoomed in? is the image blurry?
Look into 'contentmode' for UIImage
How can I do that? lol 
[here's Apple's documentation] (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage). It will be as simple as something like this: myImage.contentMode = .scaleToFill // or whatever option
If you want it all to be seen though, it should be a fit. Like .ScaleAspectFit 
FaceTime. 
Can you use it within an app? The app will do more than just the video chat between the two devices.
I'd definitely go with WebRTC but maybe we should mention that there are also services providing it so you don't have to create signaling, turn and stun server. One option there would be twilio
IMO two of the most time-consuming and difficult parts of building a social networking app are managing user authentication / roles and building a threaded messaging system. Personally, the SQL queries are what took the most of my time. Unfortunately, I don't have any examples to share, but the workflow is the same for any other webapp you're developing.
&gt; twilio Yeah I was looking at their getting started guide here: https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/ios-v1-getting-started Will try it out later today. Thanks for the recommendation!
Yes please because I paid for it... sad it was gone....
It's not gone, I just haven't updated it in a while. It's still available.
Link please!
[removed]
It works well enough, but it's not without a couple warts. Really big library too.
for (_, person) in people.enumerated() { // doing things }
I am a pretty new with swift lol I’m taking a iOS course with developes and there teaching me to make a social media app with instant messaging and a home screen that refreshes when people post. It works pretty well and I use google firebase for right now but to answer your question yes I have no idea what I’m talking about 
Making the large corporation to do it. 
I just started doing this because of that exact article! However, I noticed that because Xcode only handles git repos for projects (not workspaces), it could lead to having nested git repos, or committing/pushing changes in one repo and not the rest. Instead, I’ve started making different build targets within the same project. All the files for a given target are stored in their own folder within the project, and each target can be linked to other targets as “Linked Frameworks and Libraries.” Just as long as all the targets are kept discrete, instead of all targeting one master target. I needed everything to be in one git repo without a risk of Xcode’s source control saving one part of the project and not another, because of the team I work on. Linking can be a little painful though, and I don’t really love my approach. Open to other suggestions. 
Lmao. /thread
This approach doesn't work with Interface Builder though.
Correct, I wouldn't have suggested it if the OP was using storyboards or xib files. If you are using IB then just set the textColor and font directly in the storyboard/xib file.
Did someone actually use that?
Thank you! This looks to be exactly what I am needing!
&gt; it appears to me that in order to become good at Swift you need to know about all of Apple's libraries Absolutely not the case, I promise you. I’d barely used SpriteKit before making the SpriteKit version of my Pokémon game, I’d barely used GameplayKit (beyond random number generation) before making the AI side of it, etc. It’s all stuff I picked up as and when I needed to implement those features. Just go ahead and start making something - when you need to, say, implement multiplayer, go ahead and look at MultipeerConnectivity or GameKit.
Yeah that's what I got from the nature of his question. You have to realize that most social media apps were much more simple than they are now. Facebook of today has hundreds even thousands of developers working for them. You might be able to make something very simple and small but it won't be Facebook or Snapchat. &amp;#x200B; Also social media apps are the hardest field to break into which is why nobody really does them. You would be crushed in the App Store search under the giants like FB and Insta. The business end of this deal is extremely difficult and shouldn't really be done unless you have the backing of a large corporation. 
It might be useful if you don’t want to style every similar looking UILabel every time apart 
Will do thanks guys I appreciate it. Where did you learn? Right now I’m taking a course from udemy and I’m learning but it’s pretty tough 
Check out firebase for sign up/login
Sign up and login is going to increase the complexity of your app pretty significantly. If you’re new to coding I would highly recommend creating an app that is only on device code. When you add sign up and login you need to worry about setting up a back end and adding networking to your app which are not simple tasks. If your heart is set on an app with sign up and login then go for it, it will come with obstacles but not ones that you won’t be able to overcome. If you’re doing this mostly to learn, you’re going to learn more about IOS development (instead of API development) by doing an app that does all it needs to on device. There’s even some cool stuff that apple has introduced recently like machine learning on device. Apple has some sample machine learning models and they aren’t super complicated to integrate into your app. Hope this helps!
Yeah, also Firebase for me. Its literally free to set up, you just handle the password criteria with regex. Like if you need one capital, special character, etc with the regex.
yes
Cocoapods is a dependency manager
Not to mention that storing usernames/passwords is *extremely* easy to get wrong.
Open up the swift docs and start going through and doing their tutorials. Udemy and others I find aren't very good at learning programming.
&gt; So the question is, is CocoaTouch just the name for ALL of Apple's toolkits? No, no matter how exactly you define CocoaTouch, it doesn't include AppKit.
&gt;is CocoaTouch just the name for ALL of Apple's toolkits? No, [Cocoa Touch is Foundation + UIKit.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Cocoa.html) &gt;Cocoapods would be community created toolkits? Cocoapods is a way to install community toolkits (frameworks) into your app. Not all 3rd party frameworks are integrated with Cocoapods, only if you specifically add Cocoapods support to your framework. 
Thank you for your suggestion. I was using alamofire which seems more complicated. 
Do you really need login? Because depending on your needs CloudKit might be enough. It also isn't exactly easy (or very good). But should be easier for someone beginning. Explaining a bit better. If you want to store some data associated with the user you can make him log to his iCloud account. Skipping the need for you to handle password/email/account information
Since we're in /r/Swift you might want to consider creating a backend in \[Vapor\]([https://vapor.codes/](https://vapor.codes/)) for login and sign up. You can use it to write your backend in Swift and even use Xcode as your IDE. Vapor apps are commonly deployed to Heroku or Vapor Cloud, but AWS is probably an option too. The Hacking With Swift people even wrote a \[book\]([https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/server-side-swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/server-side-swift)) on Vapor development.
Depending on OP's natural coding ability I would think this would be too much of an ask for a complete beginner.
Alamofire isn't comparable to Firebase. Alamofire is just a networking library; it doesn't provide the backend that actually stores users and processes logins. Firebase is both, and more.
Thank you all for the information, it looks like at this time, I'll stick a device only app as I'm just learning I don't want to get scared off. 
.... oof.
You say toolkits when you should be using frameworks. And it's not all of the frameworks either. 
Who downvotes comments like this when they are so correct? Take my upvote.
&gt; Its literally free It's* literally free it's = it is or it has : / 
Since you're doing it as a test exercise and it's only locally, save the data in NSUserDefaults. You should have mentioned that this was meant to be a test exercise for you, not a real user login in a professional product. If you did, we could have advised you better. Networking is overkill if this is a sample project for you. Reposting this at the top level for visibility. 
Fair point :)
Nil be a cruel mistress. 
She do be
The nil-coalescing operator is very nice too: print(nil ?? 10) // 10
Lesson learned. Never force unwrap
Their gonna be so mad reading this comment.
Thanks! This is what I needed to hear.
Would you like to get more positive in your business page?
Related to my other question on here, how exactly do I get the soundcard to play data sequentially in Swift? I am encoding data using a binary phase shift at a rate of 31.25Hz, meaning there's 1142 samples per bit and a maximum of 12 bits per character. I want to get the samples for each waveform and queue them up on the soundcard without overwriting the previous data or leaving gaps between waveforms, but am uncertain if I'm doing this already or how to do so if not. 
Would you like to get more positive in your apps?
You probably already have the answer, but basically you want to look into Auth. These might get you started, you also might want to see if there's an easier way to do it thru Realm or Firebase, maybe CloudKit. https://itnext.io/basic-authentication-for-ios-using-aws-amplify-and-amazon-cognito-233b943222d4 https://itnext.io/unauthenticated-access-to-aws-for-ios-apps-using-aws-amplify-cb87222eb5d
Sounds like you should develop a base class and then use said base class to generate 2 separate controllers. I feel like that would be the best way to not have a controller that just has spaghetti code splattered all over it. 
No bueno buddy 😂 if you're using Swift might as well use it's features
if he has to ask this question, I'd say safe bet is to have 2 controllers. Spaghetti code happens when newbs try fancy things like "base classes". Generally how you end up with "god" classes.
as a rule of thumb. if you want to use a boolean to change the behavior, you're doing something wrong. ;) In this case, use 2 classes.
Putting up with the client 
And with this I vote we disable image posts in this sub. 
Nop, that’s a bad advice. Guard implies fallback logic, while forced unwrapping is an invariant stating that some variable being nil at this point is an incorrect program state, and the safest you can do is to fatal out. 
No it’s not, it’s clearer to wrap the error in that case instead of force unwrapping, and then properly handle the error. Obviously not propagating incorrect program state is a good thing, but only in super rare cases should you actually crash. 
You shouldn’t have invariants violated in released software. If you have nil where you are supposed to never have one at this point of execution, there is no way to handle that “properly”. Every expression in language has its own semantics, telling people to stick to one of them is inadequate. If you can handle the “error”, that simply means that this expression is not an invariant and using guard is indeed a wise choice.
I agree with you in theory, but most of us here are writing apps for users to enjoy. There are varying levels of invariants to deal with, and crashing for every one of them is like using a sledgehammer. In my experience the vast majority are “errors” that can be handled “properly” and not something with no means of recovering from. 
"guard let instead of !" has become sort of a cargo cult dogma in some parts of the swift community. I've seen plenty functions that fail silently (best case after printing a log to the console) for developer errors. They are basically reintroducing the problems of nil in Objective-C. Same thing happens with nil-coalescing. Programmers provide "default" values they just arbitrarily picked to avoid a forced unwrap. And when swiftlint tells you "Force Cast Violation: Force casts should be avoided." you will replace your perfectly valid: let layer = layer as! CAShapeLayer with the logically invalid but linter-pleasing: guard let layer = layer as? CAShapeLayer else { return } 
What is the point of this blog post? There is nothing for anyone to learn (you are clearly still learning yourself), and nothing interesting about your journey. You need to ask yourself: why would anyone want to read this? What am I providing that will make people want to come back?
&gt;minimal content creator
Two primary reasons for the blog.1) As a way to just step into the blogging scene and 2) it was just an intro to the tutorial of implementing a uicollectionview into a uistackview. I was planning on creating a YouTube video and blog post on the subject. I wouldn’t really say I’m still learning, I just want to post blogs about what I have learned and help others as others have helped me
&gt;Three days later with 4 hours put into each day on each view controller, here is the result. I think you **are** still learning, you should find a better way to show what you are learning and try to help others that are in the same position as you. I don't see any point in this blog post honestly.
So, you’re saying it’s a typical Medium post? Gotcha. 
I agree it's awesome. @rennarda: what do you think is the best similar/comparing course for starting macOS development?
Not to wanting to bring you down but yes you can safely remove this and no value will have been lost.
Forget what the other commenters have said – you've done just fine for your first attempt, and I think you should be proud. Don't delete the post just because some [critics](http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html) didn't like it. You've identified a problem, solved it, and written up your experience. Not only did that take work from you, but you also had the courage to hit Publish, which already puts you ahead of most of the folks shouting from the peanut gallery. Could this post be better? Of course it can, but that just means you have more to learn, and you have the opportunity to improve and do better. For example, you might want to think about: - What approaches did you try that didn't work? - What was the final approach you took that worked? - Were there any "aha!" moments where you had real breakthrough? - How would you code it differently next time? You've posted your code onto GitHub for others to look at, which is very thoughtful. Perhaps you could pick out a few key functions or methods from there that would help folks understand the problem and solution more clearly. I've written [a lot of tutorials about Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), and I feel confident your contribution is a great first step. Well done!
What is the point of this reply? Who cares if OP is still learning, aren’t we all? One of the best ways to make sure you understand something is to try to teach others. Maybe OP had a really great time writing this code and wanted to share it with others. Just because you didn’t enjoy it doesnt mean others won’t learn something. Instead, you could try encouraging OP. They took the time to write up their experience. If you think it’s lacking in some way then try to present that constructively with some suggestions for how they can improve. We all start somewhere whether it’s programming, writing... or even critiquing 😉
Thanks. This is in line with what the other commenters have said but this is the explanation I understood the best. I’ll be implementing this this afternoon!
Great for you man, i hope I wasn’t too harsh, keep trying, nobody is amazing at their first attempt 😉. Good luck, i’m sure you’ll find a way to give back what you have learned.
Why not use swift playgrounds? 
Wow, I totally could have made this as a Playground book instead, with hidden code to test the user’s code... I forgot I could do that. That probably would have been way easier. Well, this was still fun to make!
I guess doing it for objc was not worth their time. Swift is great anyways
The whole goal of Swift was to have an easy language to write short play programs with. So Swift came as much out of playgrounds as reverse. They were also released at the same time.
There might be some preference in doing extra work to support the new language but that is not the main reason. Xcode’s base compiler is [LLVM](https://llvm.org) an open source project started by some Apple employees in university years ago. This technology is used widely by many companies and maintained by groups of Apple, Google, Facebook, and other engineers to compile C like languages. Swift has not only made advancements at the language level but works on a higher level [swift compiler](https://swift.org/compiler-stdlib/#compiler-architecture) with a lot of additions that allow it to have the [REPL](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=18). This is the `Read Eval Print Loop` feature that makes Playgrounds possible. And implementing that kind of feature for Objective-C would require a massive rewrite of those systems to allow for the compiler to be at the speed needed for REPL. I am not saying it can’t be done but even with Apple’s resources it does not make any sense. The cost to benefit analysis of the research alone required for this type of change would be a waste of resources. It is just really hard from a time and cost perspective to see any value in this for the future of Apple development.
You're right, though he's right about the way apple treats its products.
Before playgrounds and Swift I used this app to try out little snippets. https://coderunnerapp.com Just including it in case your follow up question was going to be “so, if no playgrounds then how do I run little snippets”
Still better than being toxic under anonymity. 
Well, my girlfriend carries my old iPhone 6 Plus and it works fine. I don't see a problem with the way Apple treats its products. 
This is right on target! The end of Objective C is coming sooner than many believe. 
He's asking us what he thinks. I told him what I think, and offered him ways to make it better. If this is what his blog will be, he will fail. Better to be honest now than coddle him and pretend it's great while he sits there wondering why he only gets 2 views. 
Beyond that even though Swift is Apples future it has been under heavy development since introduction. Apple has been very up front about that and Swift’s open source nature makes it easy to check on this. It takes awhile to boil a language and it’s libraries down into something that is a considerable improvement over old. Frankly I think it is pretty cool to see programming languages evolve overtime. One of the reasons I follow C++ development, even though my C++ use these days is near zero, is to see how it evolves and how features are settled upon. Swift provides the same opportunity to learn for a person interested in such things. All the forums are open, Swift.org is great, and there is plenty of third party info. For Apple I just see Playgrounds as another tool to get the message across. 
It’s an ugly and verbose language, but I like it. I haven’t delved deep into swift, but I can’t see it replacing objC. That would mean rewriting all macos X platform objC frameworks into swift. Impossiburu
Is the way Apple treats its products bad though. You could be left with the legacy he’ll that is Microsoft. On the flip side you could enjoy the constant API changes in Linux that breaks code all the time. Apple is actually very good with APIs, a programmer using them properly will have minor problems over the years. 
How do you print bold text to standard output without hardcoding control characters? My program receives HTML text, so I imagine the ideal solution involves `NSAttributedString`.
Never since all new code is in Swift. So yeah, that's probably what your point was, and what Apple thought. 
People have claimed iOS development is doomed since the birth of the App Store. In reality, the demand for native iOS development has only grown. AppFigures found that between 2016 and 2017, non-native apps shrunk from 32% to 24%. They didn't use a survey to figure it out. They downloaded a huge volume of apps in the App Store and examined the code. You can't fudge those numbers. https://blog.appfigures.com/ios-developers-ship-less-apps-for-first-time/ All of the web tech you list tries to solve problems that have existed forever. Every few years a new technology comes around that claims to solve the same problems. It fails, wasting a bunch of time and money, and everyone goes back to what they were doing before. I've gotten a lot better use out of my time since learning to avoid these distractions.
Most of Apple apps were made in Obj-C. That's going to take a while
Explain why all the frameworks that matter are still in Objective-C and tell me when they’re gonna be rewritten in Swift with no bugs
Actually Foundation was already ported to Swift. That leaves AppKit, UIKit, and some other much smaller frameworks to go. A lot of Objective-C frameworks are really wrappers for lower level frameworks, IIRC.
Apps will take awhile no doubt there. Some could use it though (looking at Mail). I do find it amazing that people think that the end of Objective C means it will happen instantly. 
Isn’t that a bit asinine to even ask? Nothing happens instantly and Swift itself is still under heavy development. Maybe you have issues grasping those concepts. Beyond that are you honestly trying to say that today’s frameworks have no bugs? The writing is on the wall so to speak, Objective C is being marginalized at Apple and will die off far sooner than many would like to admit. 
You’re the one making the case that the end of Objective-C is coming sooner than people would think, when 95% of Apple is writing Objective-C. In no way is it being marginalised at Apple; if anything the older employees are railing *against* Swift. And I was saying that the frameworks are likely never to be rewritten in Swift, considering doing so would just add more bugs.
The end of objective c "came" 2 years ago when Apple began rewriting O.S apps in swift. Even though swift has no ABI stability, it is here to stay and it will continue get better while obj-c rots. It pains me to see it but obj-c is very old and very insecure compared to more modern oop languages. 
Objective-C will be around forever as long as Apple exists. No doubt.
Sanoneco gave a good technical answer about the compiler, but Apple also cares about usability: Defining a class in Objective-C is annoying as hell. Apple could absolutely make an ObjC Playground happen, but it would be a lot of effort on their side, and there would be even more stupid language "gotchas" that newbs would have to deal with beyond Xcode blowing up or freezing on them. Remember, we can't even trust Swift Playgrounds to be stable sometimes. 
That way of doing image literals was removed here is the [new](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51397347/xcode-10-image-literals-no-longer-available) way 
lol, Objective-C is 30+ years old, it's not going anywhere. Limiting scope to Apple's platforms, we have to be more than 5 years out from "deprecation" so to speak. A lot of frameworks and apps use C++ when they need complexity and speed, which requires Objective-C++ to work. And that integration is pretty clean and seamless. Swift is changing fast, there are going to be huge performance gains in the next few years, but I don't think it's going to beat C++ when heavy-lifting needs to be done. At least not 5 years from now. Also, I'll bet money Adobe's Photoshop for iPad is a lot of C++. Good luck getting them to rewrite everything if Apple removes Objective-C support. 
The left side wluld stay the same. [Here](https://youtu.be/igOpntQg1YI) is a video that has better explanation than what I could give.
Apple excel's at this. all they have to do is end support and if adobe doesn't want to be on their platform they will either write their own app or buy one. this is how we got final cut because adobe didn't want to play ball and made premiere for os x. &amp;#x200B; how did that work out for adobe?
Because the Swift team wrote playgrounds.
&gt; Defining a class in Objective-C is annoying as hell. How? 
I think he means no more new apps or updates to apps written in obj
Phil Schiller was a guest at Adobe's conference a couple months ago. Adobe presented Photoshop onstage at the last Apple event. These big companies don't decide to work together on a whim, and Apple isn't going to screw Adobe. They are both invested in each other.
I have the same phone and I’ve watched it gradually slow down with every software update to the point of annoyance (not saying that yours should be the same though). It’s not an old phone really, it’s 3 years old. Hardware-ly speaking it hasn’t degraded really. This tells me they don’t optimize for previous arquitectures when they release a new version. Maybe they don’t care, or it’s on purpose, who knows. But the fact remains.
Sorry for the long post. There’s a couple of lawsuits against apple for purposefully slowing down devices. But I can’t really distinguish the true from the false in them.
You guys are really stuck on Objective C. 
You do have to redo your code when they change the API, which they have done quite a bit.
&gt;In summary: we'll be living with Objective-C lurking in the background for a long time. It'll always be there if you need to use it, at least for the next 5-7 years You even put that in bold. This amounts to what I have said, you just used different words. 
No what? What does Apple need to do here chisel the message into stone for you? 
Build a simple music app you can get the json from [iTunes RSS](https://rss.itunes.apple.com/en-us) 
Go to Settings app, and under Battery, check the Battery Health. What does it say there? Perhaps the battery needs replacement. Old batteries cause some iPhones to lower their speed. 
every couple of years company engineers feel the need for some resume driven development &amp; to build hype in the community for "new things", apple went to swift,android went to kotlin/flutter and ms is pushing asp.net core with all their might obj c is just as good for small dev teams imo,just expect increasingly reduced support from apple as the years go by

That should suit your needs, i believe. Note: I'm not affiliated with Ray Wenderlich. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.raywenderlich.com/548-mapkit-tutorial-getting-started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/548-mapkit-tutorial-getting-started)
This is the actual reason, cannot believe that future and past bullshit is the top comment, pretty much reflects the maturity of the sub....
As long as C++ is used, Objective-C is not going anywhere. Swift doesn’t have C++ interoperability and is not going to have it anytime soon. 
That counts as "dumping on"? I didn't see anything but comstructive criticism and one borderline questionable attitude. I only just subscribed so I don't know if any of what you say is a real problem or not, but low effort/quality posts are problems elsewhere (as are self-promoting links that provide no other information or context) and should definitely be addressed if there are too many of them in a given community. I would unsub without a second thought if those were the types of posts I saw in my feed.
A simple pong or breakout...
Good first step! You have the basics : - Intro - The problem you ought to solve - Solution you found * Bonus point for GIFs * Another bonus point for the Github link. It's always a nice to have! 
There’s a list of public apis [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#art--design) and I’m sure similar lists elsewhere. Have a look through and see if you get any inspiration. I like the look of the open trivia database for making a little quiz app. If you’re just getting started and aren’t expected to do anything too complex then most things will be fairly similar. Request some data, wait for a response and then display what you get back. You may learn more and/or do more if you find something interesting to work on.
Late to the party but - Are you doing the Hacking with swift course? ( https://hackingwithswift.com/read ). It teaches you making apps through example projects. I am doing it myself right now and I would recommend it. I don't think an arbitrary measure of progress will help you make better apps.
You could add a tap gesture recogniser to the section header view and call it from its delegate function. One more thing that I just noticed it, the "currentExpandedSection = section" line should go before the reloadSections. As of right now , that line can run after the "numberOfRowsInSection", (not likely, but still). class MyTapGestureRecognizer: UITapGestureRecognizer { var associatedValue: Any? init(target: Any?, action: Selector?, associatedValue: Any?) { self.associatedValue = associatedValue super.init(target: target, action: action) } } var currentExpandedSection: Int? func expand(section: Int, tableView: UITableView) { var sections = [section] if let oldSection = currentExpandedSection, oldSection != section { sections.append(oldSection) } currentExpandedSection = section tableView.reloadSections(sections, with: .automatic) } func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, willDisplayHeaderView view: UIView, forSection section: Int) { if (view.gestureRecognizers?.first as? MyTapGestureRecognizer) == nil { let tap = MyTapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(onSectionHeaderViewTap(_:)), associatedValue: nil) tap.associatedValue = section view.addGestureRecognizer(tap) } else { (view.gestureRecognizers!.first as! MyTapGestureRecognizer).associatedValue = section } } @objc func onSectionHeaderViewTap(_ sender: MyTapGestureRecognizer) { guard let section = sender.associatedValue as? Int else { return } if let newExpandedSection = currentExpandedSection, newExpandedSection != section { expand(section, tableView) } } Warning: this only works if you want to have a max of 1 section expanded. The way I did it on my project was to have a Set&lt;Int&gt; of expanded sections, and when the user taps on its header it toggles the "expanded" state (ie, adds or removes the section index from the set).
I am not sure if I correctly understand what you need or if I am to late. &amp;#x200B; are those methods that use the array methods of the viewcontroller class?
&gt;Any info on good software to develop iOS apps with &amp;#x200B; I guess you will be bound to xcode. &amp;#x200B; I have heard of things like xamarin that are used to build apps for ios and android at the same time, but you will not get around xcode as it will be used to publish the app to the apple appstore. &amp;#x200B; if you are completely new to coding you could start with the playground in xcode, it will let you try out basic programming without the whole project overhead.
Because Obj-C doesn’t play around.
Link doesn’t work 
The methods are of the viewcontroller class. Just in different methods (ie. being triggered from a button push) 
ok, than I am not sure where the problem is. &amp;#x200B; you can call your array from within both methods as self.array1 if you change it in one method, the other method wll later on work on the changed array when it also refers to self.array1 &amp;#x200B; if I got you wrong and you want the second method to work on the state of the array before the changes, you will need to have a second array variable to hold the original state. maybe I can help more if you can give me an example of your class and the methods in questions 
The best way to help is put your example code in a playground and see if it compiles fine. If not then anyone who wants to help you will have to figure out all that missing stuff. For example, `SortedTimeItemSection` has no definition at all.
That's one of the main issues here, we get a lot of those kinds of posts that come through and hang around. There's a big disconnect here between people learning Swift, people promoting themselves, and people who are advanced programmers interested in advanced Swift usage.
I works now, but the adds no extra information. Let's get started to coming soon? Epic spam...
There's more than just that but I'm glad you got an answer.
Along with the "how do i get started" posts, there are also fairly frequent posts that are really about iOS APIs specifically and should probably be posted in r/iosprogramming. There's some overlap between the two subs but there should be a distinction between posts where the language being Swift is relevant and where Swift happens to be the language the op is writing in.
Something like this is probably what you want. You really should be converting some of those Strings into Dates though. Your life would be much easier in the long run. let groupedByDate = Dictionary(grouping: items, by: { $0.date }) .sorted(by: { $0.key &lt; $1.key }) .reduce([SortedItemInDays]()) { partial, next in let items = next.value.sorted(by: { $0.start &lt; $1.start }) return partial + [SortedItemInDays(date: next.key, items: items)] } // The below assumes that all the FieldData items with the same date, also have the same week. let groupedByWeek = Dictionary(grouping: groupedByDate, by: { $0.items.first!.week }) .sorted(by: { $0.key &lt; $1.key }) .reduce([SortedDaysInWeeks]()) { partial, next in let days = next.value.sorted(by: { $0.date &lt; $1.date }) return partial + [SortedDaysInWeeks(weekValue: next.key, days: days)] } return groupedByWeek 
A lot of that will be less and less important as Apple moves toward combining iOS API and macOS API. There's already been several cross-implementations which have sought to combine the elements similar between the two, such as `CGPoint` over `NSPoint` and much more.
Thanks, will take a look when I’m at home. Regarding the dates. This code is executed on a server. And the responses need be JSON compliant. I’m creating the date objects on the mobile devices. Thanks for the tip
Thanks, will take a look when I’m at home. Regarding the dates. This code is executed on a server. And the responses need be JSON compliant. I’m creating the date objects on the mobile devices. Thanks for the tip
Why can't `Date` be JSON compliant?
Well according to [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp) “JSON values cannot be one of the following data types: a function a date undefined”
`Date` is `Codable`: [swift-corelibs-foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/c3d8ef96078b422ebc6ada6d051c4ae750482e6a/Foundation/Date.swift#L271) extension Date : Codable { And dates are undefined in JSON, you need to define them on the server, transmit them in a JSON primitive type, and then convert to a Swift `Date` either through a string and `DateFormatter`, an number value and a [epoch timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) of some kind, or some kind of JSON object.
You can do it, but you have to write a custom init method for the type. I still think you should do it.
I think he should do it too! ;-)
Thank you. However the server which I do not control is only returning partial date strings. The server is not under my control. Just have to use whatever I get. When I have some extra time I’ll look into again. For now the problem is solved using the strings and int’s privided. 
On the clients I transform the date string values into date objects that are used throughout the application For the middleware, where this code resides I find it to overkill to first create the date objects that I later have to turn back into the json primitive string to send it to the client, when I can solve the problem as I stated in a comment using the strings and int values provided from the server, that I do not control.

I recently started learning Swift (no previous background in programming or coding) and im a few weeks in. So far I haven't had any real difficulty grasping the concepts and following along is pretty easy. I'm just curious why you personally recommend python or java as a first language as opposed to swift? 
Cells can be selected programmatically, you could use a delegate for that for example when somebody sets the cursor in the textfield. It's a bit of hack though.
So give a few example links then, we need to see how they are formatted to help. Certainly if they're links you'll want to use [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) as an easy way of modifying them.
Python is the first language many people learn nowadays because of the simplicity and wide-usage. Swift has some interesting concepts like protocol-oriented programming, optionals, if let statements but I wouldn’t recommend it as a first language. You’ll spend more time connecting outlets and doing trivial shit Xcode makes you do which is inconvenient for learning the fundamentals of programming. Python and Java are usually taught first in school because of how easy the syntax is to understand. 
You could get that setup with Firebase in a a couple hours
I considered releasing an app to just authenticate and then use the extension like you said. Also thanks, I’ll take my question there.
Honestly, you could just throw a static JSON file on a webserver/lambda/s3 or whatever, and have the app pull that down. Then you wouldn't have to rely on something like Firebase, and could manually update the JSON until you need to automate it.
https://imgur.com/a/3EsdAQb uploaded a video that shows the behavior. sorry for the low resolution i cannot show more of the app.

Yes, that's correct. If you \*really\* want the selection delegate method to work, you can make the text view not respond to user input, then only turn on user input when tapped, then set it as the first responder, and translate the cursor position to the appropriate place in the text. You can also subclass the UITextField and have it send a touch control event to it's parent in the responder chain when enabled. 
I don't understand how you can write `class MyClass {}` in Swift and then go back to writing `@interface MyClass: NSObject @end @implementation MyClass @end` and not be annoyed as hell. Then the added nitpick of having a header and implementation file.
Yes, Apple needs some sample code in swift. There's a good tutorial [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/548-mapkit-tutorial-getting-started) at Ray Wenderlich (who, with a name like that, should be a magician).
Thanks for reply. At current stage, I don't think I need that method to work for that cell (it's used only to collect user input).
Thanks for the reply!

Over 95% of the posts here are about iOS, not Swift. The example post mentioned here is about UICollectionView layout. The GitHub project linked at the bottom of the post uses Swift but only trivially. It could have just as easily been in Objective-C, with exactly the same structure and number of lines. What is the point of r/swift today? It used to be mostly about the programming language, but it's drifted so far that now I really don't know how it's supposed to be any different than r/iOSProgramming (the top "related subreddit" on the side of every page here). Apparently having anything at all to do with the Swift programming language is not required. Posting FAQs is also apparently allowed, which calls into question the purpose of having FAQs, or mods, as well. The top "chatroom" in the sidebar is freenode #swift-lang, which is completely different from this. Only the Swift programming language itself is on topic there. A question isn't on topic just because it happens to *use* Swift, unless it's *about* Swift (syntax, parsing, codegen, etc). Why are we here? Is this just a poor clone of r/iOSProgramming?
It's getting into decent money, but we're not paying ourselves 100% with this yet, more like 50% after 6 years :D
This question is better served in the /r/iOSProgramming subreddit. This subreddit is for more general Swift discussions. &amp;#x200B; I think you'll just have to bite the bullet and redesign your UI so that the UIDatePicker is a normal size. I don't think it's conducive to a good user app experience to have a date picker that small. Otherwise, if you want to keep it at that size, the typical path developers would take is to subclass UIDatePicker or UIPickerView and customize it. That's not a simple solution, but I don't think there is one here.
Very cool; congrats!

There's only one way to learn something, do the work needed to learn it. There are no shortcuts around that. You'll learn it as fast as you can learn it if you put in the work. If you need to learn it faster than that then you're out of luck. What's the urgency?
Where can I learn it though? I wanna put in work to learn it. 
Okay, and thanks for this amazing statement i really appreciate you that I know a few about programming language like c++ and java and php but swift looks different and new I just need to know how to started until I designed my own app. 
Swift really isn’t that different than the other C-style languages out there. Most of your programming knowledge will carry over. I’d start with the official [documentaion](https://swift.org/documentation/), there are some good links there. After that there’s the [Stanford course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120) and other various courses and books. Truthfully, I don’t know many of the more popular courses out there because I’ve done quite a bit of C, C++, Java, and Objective-C programming and I was able to pick up Swift mostly from the official documentation and libraries. Other people will take other paths to learn the language, I’m sure. Good luck on your learning! If you have any programming questions then post them here and I’ll help if I’m able, as will other people I’m sure. 
I gave an answer [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9wmiz5/he_there_i_need_to_learn_this_programming/e9lt74j/), I hope it gets you started!

If your whole data fits into json, just implement a custom url scheme in your app. Something like `yourapp://open-object?data=&lt;json&gt;` This link you can then send to your buddy and that will open the app on their device. Then you need to parse the Json and stuff. Basically custom url scheme is your keyword.

Highly recommend SwiftBySundell, Ray Wenderlich, HackingWithSwift's Paul Hudson (/u/twostraws), and some of our very own that you'll recognize if you stick around! :) I also recommend Twitter by following the iOS dev community. If you're also interested in Server Side Swift, the Vapor community is awesome and welcoming. I'm sure more recommendations will pop up, but it's a good place to be.

If by OS X you mean if it's available on a *Mac* , yes, there is Playgrounds available in Xcode, Apple's IDE for app development (downloadable free of charge from the Mac Store).. You can create playgrounds for macOS, iOS or tvOS within Xcode. It's a great place to test out snippets of your code, or if you are a beginner like me, to practice writing code to familiarize yourself with Swift. 
There isn’t too much information there as to what the awards mean, what do the winners get, why are there awards, anything other than lists of names. What’s the point of it?
But no game like playground? Like such https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8
Many thanks for reporting this! Sorry, Carthage is not supported currently, there are instructions available for SwiftPM and CocoaPods in README.md. I'm happy to merge a PR with Carthage support if anyone would be able to provide it, otherwise I hope I'll be able to fix this in the next couple of weeks.
Thanks for the replies all! Time to get reading!
Nope. The idea behind the Playgrounds app on iPad is to help you eventually ease into Xcode playgrounds on the Mac. Would have been cool tho to have a Mac version of gamified playgrounds, like on the iPad. 
That makes sense. Maybe one day they will bring it to Mac
Can the same technique work on word?
Generally that's for a closure that takes a function signature. func attemptLogin(result: Bool) { print(result) } func doSomething(completion: (Bool) -&gt; ()) { completion(true) } doSomething(completion: attemptLogin(result:)) // "true" You have a function named `attemptLogin` that has a parameter `result` which is a `Bool` and returns nothing. You pass it to `doSomething` which takes a closure with the same signature as `attemptLogin`.
I think so, as long as those are saved in the new .docx format (described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML), not the old binary .doc. But .docx is used by default in all recent versions of Office, I highly doubt you'd stumble upon active Word 95 users.
Hrm, the attemptLogin function looks like this: func attemptLogin(authenticationResult: AuthenticationResult) { switch authenticationResult { case .success: return self.verifyDevicePermission() case .error(let message): self.dismiss(animated: false, completion: nil) return self.performSegueToError(message: message) } } So basically there's no way to pass an additional argument here at all. Note, I didn't write this originally - I inherited this part of the code.
There may be ways around this, what is the additional parameter you want to add? Be specific about what you're trying to do.
I just want to pass in an additional string in additionally whenever attemptLogin is called
And do what with it? 
Yeah, it sounds more like you need to think out your architecture a bit than you need to pass a string in there. If you end up needing to keep a string like that then you could just wrap the function: func attemptLogin(authenticationResult: AuthenticationResult, code: String) { attemptLogin(authenticationResult: AuthenticationResult) // … } 
I think I love you 
I mean the whole architecture has already been created before me, and I am trying to extend it, rather than rip it entirely apart and rewrite it - a cost I certainly can't justify to my client. I just need to save a singular value when a button is clicked. Anyway, your example isn't working for me when I implement it (I get the error, *Cannot convert value of type 'AuthenticationResult.Type' to expected argument type 'AuthenticationResult'*), and I think I've hit upon a workable solution that will work for my purposes and allow me to save a value. Thank you for your help.

Happy to help!
You should give it a try! Listening to people having a discussion is really stimulating, and provides something totally different to reading a blog post or SO answer. In terms of technical complexity there’s a pretty wide range, from shows that are totally personality driven, to something like swift unwrapped which pretty much exclusively discusses the latest approved proposals to the language, usually far in advance of them making it in to a public release. 
You can remove the utility methods and place them inside the enum. It makes sense that a type knows that, you stop having a utility method that would be harder to find and you’d get a lot of readibility. Just add a init(string:) and you are ready to go. :) and it’s also very testable. 
I really appreciate your comment, I ‘ll fix it today 🤓
I've tried it, it does nothing for me. I'm much better off reading text and following along that way than listening to people talk about code.

Are you sure your player outputs 2 channels? I'm not too well versed with AVAudioEngine but I guess this \`player?.outputFormat(forBus: 0))!\` is only one channel. If you want stereo you'd need 2 players which each output 1 mono channel and merge them with the mixer.
I had this asked to me in an interview recently: What ways are there to make a concurrent queue act like a serial queue?

How do I encode multiple objects to a JSON file with JSONEncoder? At the moment if I only encode one of my custom "Event" objects it works fine and I can read from it, but when I try to encode multiple of them I get the error "dataCorrupted(Swift.DecodingError.Context(codingPath: \[\], debugDescription: "The given data was not valid JSON.", underlyingError: Optional(Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840 "Garbage at end." UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=Garbage at end.})))". &amp;#x200B; I'm attempting to add multiple objects by doing this: "try data.append(encoder.encode(events\[i\]\[j\]))", but I'm assuming this is what causes the error. I have no idea how to "append" the next object to the data otherwise.
AppDelegate and I just have a bunch of errors :D
self.player?.outputFormat(forBus: 0).channelCount shows up as two channels. Mono would be preferable actually but I have no idea how to force that. Do you know how to force the player and/or mixer to mono output?

The SDK seems like the best place to start. There's an Online Payment API but that seems to be for only web experiences and not native mobile ones.

Depending on the use case, it may be much easier to implement Apple Pay within the app? As they already said in the thread there isn't a Swift SDK for Square, so it would probably make your life much harder.
Maybe stripe would then be the way to go
I’ve used stripe once in an iOS app. I remember it being fairly simple to setup and integrate into the app. The default payment collection UI flows it provides took care of collecting all the necessary info and sending it securely. I do remember having to setup a very simple flask server hosted on Heroku to do some other form of authorization as well. I can’t remember exactly why but there may have been an option around it as well. It’s been a while since I’ve used it, I’d recommend you take a look at their current documentation.
What is good about them?
I was thinking about this too. Let me know if you find any alternatives!

It's a good exercise. Next step is to implement a reactive library.
Nice. PromiseKit is really good too.
Okay but can we talk about your semicolons? 
I may be wrong, but I believe that JSON only allows one top-level object. You can’t just append two JSON files together, since that would mean you have **2** top-level objects. That “garbage” at the end is probably your appended data. I’m fairly new to this myself, but I *highly* recommend using `Encodable`. That protocol indicates that a type can be encoded, and it even implements it for you if your struct only contains other `Encodable` properties. Best of all, it lets you encode *collections* of types. Rather than encoding `Event`s and appending them to each other, put them in a collection like `Set&lt;Event&gt;` or `[Event]` and encode that. This should help: [Encoding and Decoding Custom Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types).
Not sure I understand what you mean here though? Compiler will compile the same code with and without semicolons at end of lines. 
how can I add that?

Keep it up! But I’d make it shorter a bit. 
Depending on how extensive your needs are, you may want to check out branch.io. The api makes it easy to handle things like detecting if the app is installed and sending the receiver to the appropriate place (either App Store or installed app) as well as other customizations and analytics.
The tableViewDelegate method is not called because the touch event is handled by the UITextField and thus never propagates up the responder chain. See the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/using_responders_and_the_responder_chain_to_handle_events) for more info on how the responder chain works. If you really want the tableViewDelegate method to be called, I can think of several different ways of doing it but they’re all a bit hacky. I’d need to understand your needs more before giving a recommendation.
Well, I for one appreciate your class _and_ your semicolons. In addition to Swift, I work in languages that require semicolons. I tried not using them in Swift because it’s “not cool to” and soon caught myself dropping them elsewhere. So I use them in Swift for consistency’s sake. (Dammit, I worked _hard_ to get good at those things!)
Thanks!
mimics* Can we talk about your adding an apostrophe to a plural for some reason?
You can use Core Data. Or if your data is not that 😁much complex, you can use User Defaults as well.
Just need to store unique objects that have a few string and double fields. But there will be multiple objects and they need to be unique. So user defaults wouldn’t work. 
Okey! Then you should use Core Data. Don’t rely on any third party framework like Realm. Use standard frameworks that Apple provides.
And this would be better than NSCoding?
Of course!
You use semicolons because you like when the compiler sanity checks your code, but then you also write code like if throwVal != nil { throw throwVal! } Don't you think that's a little ironic? Either way, I may disagree here and there with your coding style, but you do seem to style your code very consistently, I appreciate that. In case you're not aware, comments right in front of declarations need three slashes in order to be doc comments. Right now those comments don't show up e.g. below the method names in autocomplete. I was looking for a way to map promises from one type to another, and I couldn't really find it apart from using `then` and returning another promise from the closure. This is such a basic operation that I think you want to include it. See for instance your `maybeAs` method: public func `maybeAs`&lt;T&gt;(_ type: T.Type) -&gt; Promise&lt;T?&gt; { return Promise&lt;T?&gt;({ (resolve, reject) in self.then(onresolve: { (result) in resolve(result as? T); }, onreject: { (error: Error) -&gt; Void in reject(error); }); }); } Ideally, the implementation of this would simply be something like return map { $0 as? T } The `as? T` part is the only thing relevant to this method, and the rest is just boilerplate. You're repeating a lot of code throughout the source file and I'd encourage you to find abstractions that make your code more readable and maintainable. The private `State` enum has several public properties that aren't accessible because the state itself isn't accessible, I guess this is some leftover code from before the state was made private? There's no need to put `break;` at the end of each case in a `switch`, that happens by default. And similarly, this case .resolved: fallthrough case .rejected: can just be written as `case .resolved, .rejected:`. You store the `resolvers` and `rejecters` of a promise separately from its state, even though these callbacks only need to be stored when the state is `.executing`. You could consider adding those callback arrays as associated values to the `executing` case, then you don't have to rely on removing all callbacks when you're resolving a promise, and you can't accidentally store callbacks when the promise is already resolved. You switch over `state` 7 times, and each time you have to carefully lock and unlock the `NSLock`. This is quite error-prone, and it's also not very maintainable – if you ever decide to use a serial queue for atomicity instead, it's not going to be a trivial task to make this change correctly. What you could do instead is write a function that takes a `(State) -&gt; Void` closure (or even `(State) -&gt; T`) that takes care of locking and unlocking the lock. If you want to take that even further, you could create a generic `Atomic&lt;Value&gt;` type that stores a value and only lets you access it in a thread-safe way.
That was autocorrect. I noticed it after it was posted.
How is locking and unlocking an NSLock error prone? It should just block until the operation finishes.
Yeah I'm aware. I noticed it after I posted. Not sure how I managed to do that.
Don’t go with Core Data. It’s very complicated and not thread safe. In your case better use Codable protocol and store objects in JSON file. If you still want database, pick Realm but read about it’s limitations first. 
&gt;How is locking and unlocking an NSLock error prone? That's a perfectly reasonable practice for thread safety. It should just block until the (very short) operation finishes. I didn't mean to say that there's anything wrong with `NSLock`, there isn't. But you're locking and unlocking dozens of times throughout the file, and that makes it easier for you to mess up somewhere (not to mention that it doesn't really help readability either). By isolating the code that ensures thread-safety, you don't have to worry about forgetting a `lock.unlock()` call somewhere. \[This\]([https://pastebin.com/Pn9HMyQU](https://pastebin.com/Pn9HMyQU)) is what I currently use for my own promise type. It's trivial to change this to use `NSLock` instead.
Any reason you can't use a Struct? They work with getters, setters, and in initializers. I've always felt that Struct is the most relatable data type to Java objects.
Apple missed Nest (the thermostat), and mapbox. So to make up for it, and justify their fat salaries, their marketers give 3 letters acronyms to any iphone model that comes out of the lab. Just like Microsoft in the old days. &amp;#x200B; //End rant. :p
You've got a couple of options, either save the files as json or use Realm. For your needs, Core Data is overkill as well as difficult to learn. 
Do you mean on separate lines? If so, Swift already uses newlines as the line terminator and will interpret the code directly. The semicolons add... nothing. 
Thank you for the advice. &amp;#x200B; on the first look this seems to be a bit of an overkill for what I need but it looks interesting. I will read further into it.
That's demonstrably not true. I've both seen and written code in Swift where the member call is on the next line. You can even try this yourself. Please stop being assholes about semicolons. There are better things to care about.
Great Video! But can I get a link to that background? It’s really good lmao
Swift sometimes has problems with things inside blocks. It's possible that there's an error in your code inside the block and while it was compiling it had a segfault instead of showing the error. Usually what I do is start to comment parts of the code out until it compiles, then individually put parts back until it crashes again and you can narrow it down to a single line usually.
I hope we'll be able to parse Excel spreadsheets in Swift in browsers one day when WebAssembly target is working :)

Rank 0: How to self-promote in order to feel self-important
Awesome thanks I’ll look into it!
Their RxSwift book is a must-read.
Print statements go to the console. You might be able to see them by opening Console on your Mac and checking the Apple Watch there, or by pulling the log files after the fact. If it isn’t already going there, you could definitely redirect print to make it go there. I’m a novice, so take this with a grain of salt.
I tried running this on my project but got the error "no primary source file found". The file in question exists, but does have a space in the path. Is that what is causing the issue?
There could be other reasons, don’t you agree?
I don’t think that’s possible on a conceptual level. The console is showing standard output and standard error, which are streams of incoming data. It just displays that in order. If you want to clear the console, you need to tell whatever is displaying it to do so. What is this “console”, exactly? The Windows Command Prompt? &amp;#x200B; Don’t just print a bunch of line breaks, that’s really lazy. I mean, it’ll work as a hack, but don’t keep it around.
I’m not too seasoned, but I found the Swift Programming Language guide surprisingly helpful. The parts that seem obvious, in particular, are extremely good at explaining the nuances of Swift. Skim through things you already know, and you’ll find a lot of crucial advice about things like type aliasing and optional binding. I especially recommend "Control Flow”, “Functions”, "Structures and Classes”, “Properties”, and “Generics”.
I *highly* recommend reading [Apple’s online guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html). If this is your first programming language, I’d advise against trying to self-teach. Once you get a tiny bit of instruction from another person, you can learn the rest yourself much more easily. I hear Apple Stores have pretty good classes these days.
I ended up writing a simple class which puts the statement in a TableView which I use to read the log on device. Thanks for your help anyways
That doesn't sound like an error from Periphery itself, so likely one of its dependencies. Can you please email the full error output along with the --verbose flag to support@peripheryapp.com
Thanks, I'll try it on another project later and see how it works. For this project I wonder if it's something with the configuration. I ran with --verbose and get SourceKit index request failed for file '{filepath}': no primary source file found It's a macOS project using CocoaPods.
Do you have any property observers? Specifically on arrays. It doesn’t scale very well if you append items to an array in a loop and using a property observer on the array.
Most likely you’re accidentally causing copies of the array, due to arrays being value types in Swift. Second most likely, you’re accidentally building -Onone or running in a playground. Third most likely, the arc optimizer couldn’t remove some reference counting. Profiling in Instruments might help reveal which of those it is; they’re all usually avoidable, but sometimes require a little hoop jumping.
By comparison I post the two solutions. It doesn't seem to me I'm copying arrays or appending items. The code in the function is my own, the code below is pre-instrumented by HackerRank. Can you spot the problem? The solutions are both correct and use the same iteration count but the Swift timeout and C++ does not. This was the Swift: `import Foundation` `// Complete the arrayManipulation function below.` `func arrayManipulation(n: Int, queries: [[Int]]) -&gt; Int {` `var items = Array(repeating: 0, count: n)` `print("\(items)")` `for query in queries {` `let s = query[0] - 1` `let e = query[1]` `let k = query[2]` `items[s] = items[s] + k` `if (e&lt;items.count) { items[e] = items[e] - k }` `}` `var current = 0` `var max = -1` `for i in 0..&lt;items.count {` `current = current + items[i]` `if current &gt; max {` `max = current` `}` `}` `return max` `}` &amp;#x200B; `let stdout = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OUTPUT_PATH"]!` `FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: stdout, contents: nil, attributes: nil)` `let fileHandle = FileHandle(forWritingAtPath: stdout)!` `guard let nmTemp = readLine() else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `let nm = nmTemp.split(separator: " ").map{ String($0) }` `guard let n = Int(nm[0].trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines))` `else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `guard let m = Int(nm[1].trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines))` `else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `let queries: [[Int]] = AnyIterator{ readLine() }.prefix(m).map {` `let queriesRow: [Int] = $0.split(separator: " ").map {` `if let queriesItem = Int($0.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)) {` `return queriesItem` `} else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `}` `guard queriesRow.count == 3 else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `return queriesRow` `}` `guard queries.count == m else { fatalError("Bad input") }` `let result = arrayManipulation(n: n, queries: queries)` `fileHandle.write(String(result).data(using: .utf8)!)` `fileHandle.write("\n".data(using: .utf8)!)` This was the C++ &amp;#x200B; `#include &lt;cmath&gt;` `#include &lt;cstdio&gt;` `#include &lt;vector&gt;` `#include &lt;iostream&gt;` `#include &lt;algorithm&gt;` `using namespace std;` &amp;#x200B; `int main() {` `long int N,K,p,q,sum,i,j,max=0,x=0;` `cin&gt;&gt;N&gt;&gt;K;` `long int *a=new long int[N+1]();` `for(i=0;i&lt;K;i++)` `{` `cin&gt;&gt;p&gt;&gt;q&gt;&gt;sum;` `a[p]+=sum;` `if((q+1)&lt;=N) a[q+1]-=sum;` `}` `for(i=1;i&lt;=N;i++)` `{` `x=x+a[i];` `if(max&lt;x) max=x;` `}` `cout&lt;&lt;max;` `return 0;` `}`
This is completely unreadable, could you edit your comment to use code blocks instead of inline code?
The only difference that I can spot is that the. C++ solution saves one big loop by running logic while doing input, while the swift solution does all the input and then all the logic. Is this really the only difference?
I suppose, although adding yourself to rankings indicates what I’m suggesting. 
Yep, give me a moment
I used git gist, I'm not familiar with markdown.
Dynamic dispatch things like KVO, the responder chain, undo manager, respondsToSelector, performSelector, etc. Responder Chain, for one, is a pretty fundamental part of the Cocoa architecture. Unless I’ve missed something new, to the extent these are possible in Swift, it depends on using the objective-c runtime and only works with NSObject-based objects.
Probably everyone else is aware of this but putting objects in enums was incredible cool and so useful when returning from an escaping closure
Unfortunately I suspect Swift is going to collapse under the weight of a million syntactic sugar tweaks by language nerds that don’t actually make it easier to write software but make the language more complex. And then you need to learn the syntactic sugar tweaks to understand code other people wrote that uses it. The nice thing about ObjC is that it was just a small addition to C, and you could mostly ignore a lot of the “advanced” features of C.
The problem isn't creating objects, its how to store them locally.
Do you have sample input we could use? One thing I'm wondering is how much time is spent processing the input vs actually doing the array manipulation.
Are you talking about this? public enum Response { case success(Data) case failure(Error) } 
Was it this problem? https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crush/problem I haven't looked at that one yet. But looking at the Submissions board for it and filtering to just Swift submissions, there are plenty of people who scored the perfect 60/60 on it, which means that it's certainly possible to implement it efficiently enough to pass all the tests without timing out on any of them.
Hmm. Interesting. I haven't looked at any of the solutions up there (or yours, other than to see if I could make sure to pin down exactly which problem it was, based on the pre-supplied function name), because I want to try it on my own. But yes, I have had times where I implement what I am certain is a correct solution and yet half of the tests time out, and then have to spend another hour or two tweaking it until it stops timing out! I've never changed the HackerRank-supplied code that runs the function, though, and I thought that their timer didn't take anything in that into consideration. Interesting idea that I'll have to keep in mind! BTW, here's a link to an article I ran across one time when I was getting frustrated with timing out tests on a HackerRank problem. I honestly haven't read it thoroughly yet; just skimmed it at the time and then bookmarked it for future reference. It has some tips on ways to speed up Swift performance that you might want to leverage in competitive, but not necessarily in production, code. https://swiftrocks.com/competitive-programming-with-swift.html
I haven’t checked your solution yet, but are you taking the array as in/out? If not, since Array is a struct and structs are passed by value, then that huge Array is copied once when you function is called, and another time when it returns.
if you rename the file to .swift it will color code
That is actually not correct. The function parameters are constants and the write only triggers CoW when you change a variable. 
I was naively trusting HR thinking the time for the input would somehow be discounted. Me silly.
Thanks, that explains it. From now on the first time I do will be to delete HackerRank suggested code. :)
Isn't KVO implemented in Foundation? Comments on some files imply KVO will be brought to the open-source version of Foundation in the future. To wit, "note: In swift-corelibs-foundation, Key Value Observing is not yet available.". The responder chain, on the other hand, exists in the UI layer of Cocoa so I can't speak to that. &gt;to the extent these are possible in Swift, it depends on using the objective-c runtime and only works with NSObject-based objects. Is that also not true of Objective-C, to some degree? Create a class that isn't a subclass of NSObject and you lose functionality, do you not? Does that not indicate that we're talking more about API than language? NSObject isn't a part of Objective-C, after all.
Using map and flatMap on optionals.
That was useful. I'll have to try it one day, thanks. Ignore the other guys. 
Swift isn’t slow, but XCode is crushingly slow compared to most modern IDEs. Swift becoming open source was pretty much a necessity after Microsoft made .NET open source. The big miss on Apple’s part was not coupling that with a competitive IDE like Visual Studio Code, which has become immensely successful.
I thought HWS while well written would have helped me with learning to code, unfortunately right now that's not the case. I have turned to Swift Playground for the iPad. I don't know what it is but I have learned a decent amount so far. Do I still struggle with some of the challenges of course, I do find a solution to the problem whether it's a long and then I go back and shorten the code. I still am learning. There have been 2 times, soon to be 3 where I have looked online for an answer. I'm not sure if I count it as cheating, but once I see the more correct way of doing it, it somewhat clicks and almost a that was easy why didn't I think of that. Not sure any of this helped. Good luck
If I'm not "aware of" a part of Swift, how can I comment on it?
Swift uses copy-on-write: the copy only happens when the passed-in array changes. For instance: var hi = [1, 2, 3] func callfunc(_ a: [Int]) { var b = a print(b[1]) } callfunc(hi) …should not copy the values, as they weren't mutated, but: var hi = [1, 2, 3] func callfunc(_ a: [Int]) { var b = a b.removeObject(at: 0) print(b[1]) } callfunc(hi) …would copy the values in the array. &amp;#x200B; Marking the array as `inout` would make it so it wouldn't be a copy-on-write, as it's still referencing the same array.
compactMap tooooooooooooo
Great example, thanks! So, to be clear. If in your second function, A would’ve been inout. What happens when you assign A to B? Is B a reference to the array A is referencing, or a copy of said array (a.k.a copy-on-write)?
When I was staffing labs at WWDC I remember getting the most shocked reactions from people (especially those claiming to be senior engineers) at how rich Swift's enums are. So here's a few fun ones: ### Enums Can Carry Values C++ programmers rejoice, for you no longer have to implement your own discriminated union using The Old Dirty Tricks. Swift enum cases can carry values, and you can poke for those values using `switch` statements or `case` statements in conditionals. ``` enum InfInt { case negativeInf case integer(Int) case positiveInf } func getFiniteValue(_ i: InfInt) -&gt; Int? { guard case let .integer(val) = i else { return nil } return val } ``` ### Enum Case Constructors Are Functions Associated values in enum cases are awesome. But if you come from a language in the ML family, it's just kinda second nature to think of a datatype constructor a function that builds you a value of a type. Swift's enums are no different! ``` enum Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { case halfEmpty(Liquid) case halfFull(Liquid) } func outlook&lt;Liquid&gt;() -&gt; (Liquid) -&gt; Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { return Int.random(in: 1..&lt;100) % 2 == 0 ? Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfEmpty : Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfFull } ``` For those that can remember back to Swift 1.0, it took a while for this feature to make it out to the wider world (in Xcode 7/Swift 2.0 IIRC). In fact, partial application of a lot things had to be gradually implemented. ### Swifts Enums Are Algebraic Data Types Using `indirect` you can write recursive (if somewhat inefficient) ADTs just like the best of 'em ``` // Please don't ship this. This isn't a LISP, you can use Array. indirect enum List&lt;Element&gt; { case empty case cons(Element, List&lt;Element&gt;) } let example: List&lt;Int&gt; = .cons(1, .cons(2, .cons(3, .empty))) ``` `indirect` at the level of the type causes all the cases to be marked `indirect`. Naturally, this *can* be inefficient (though, there's no reason it *has* to be implemented with indirection if we can detect it, but I digress†) if you don't actually need the indirection for all the cases. You can also mark individual cases `indirect` if you want to be more precise. It turns out a lot of things have a nice recursive structure like this. And Swift lets you express those things natively and naturally. †For example, the `empty` case is (transitively) `indirect`, but because it has no associated values you can rest assured you won't eat the cost of a level of indirection for a set of associated values that doesn't actually exist. ### Runtime Layouts of Enums Is Crazy Optimized Considering just how many different flavors of enum layout that Swift supports (C-compatible, no-payload, singleton, single-payload, multi-payload, resilient, lions, tigers, bears, oh my!), it's safe to say that using an enumeration, even one that carries associated values, isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg at runtime. On this front, more support for extra inhabitants [was merged for the multi-payload](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/20561) strategy making the compiler even better about bitpacking these things for you automatically. If anybody wants me to speak more about how this works I can, but it gets a little hairy. 
Correct. It's a piece of shit.
stakcoverflow? &gt; I have few Montserrat font in You have a few **fonts*** in your list font = the singular, one item fonts = the plural, more than one item &gt; version of those font, version of those **fonts*** font = the singular, one item fonts = the plural, more than one item : /
Why would someone write an application that writes layout code for you? Why not write an application that writes all the code, so that you aren’t required at all? Software that writes software is coming, and we’ll all be out of a job, soon enough. But if you think that writing layout code is beneath you, you might be the first one unemployed.
Sounds to me like you’re just complaining because your bad at making iOS apps.
That's what designers do. They do layouts.
Do you seriously think in 3 years from now, autolayout will still be here? It's going to be gone. That code will be automatically generated by your designer. Do your sketch, XD whatever, hit publish, and it's done. It's coming. :-)
To each their own, if I want a designer to do my job I would probably consider changing professions.
Client says it HAD to be in autolayout. Else I would just write it in code.
Architects don’t lay brick.
I'm gonna be completely honest with you: I thought autolayout sucked too but then I actually read the documentation Autolayout is actually amazing. There's so much you can do with just stackviews and hugging/resistance. If you're having a ton of trouble with autolayout then it's more than likely because you don't understand those 2 things and constraints So idk. I know people love to hate on autolayout but one thing I'm learning as a developer is that people don't read documentation or try to really understand the fundamentals of the framework. I promise you if you read the documentation and play around with it for about a week or two then you'll see the power. 
People have been saying that about the web for a decade now. &amp;#x200B; And yet, here we are.
&gt;Client says it HAS to be in autolayout. Else I would just write it in code. Do you mean it has to be in storyboards/xibs? I personally do not like storyboards and avoid using them. You can write auto layout with apis and it makes everything a lot simpler imho. 
Storyboards.
Not everyone learned English as their first language or has perfect grammar. But why be helpful when you can just be a dick, right?
By far the best answer. Wow
I don’t think you understand what auto layout does or how it works. If you’re confusing Storyboards with code that’s something else, which means you also don’t understand the importance of creating Kayla your visually. It’s a lot more complicated for designers to build in Sketch. They need to account for different screen sizes (which they never do), safe area layout, size classes and conflicting constraints. And if in your mind building user facing apps is not the job of a developer, then you should switch to server side because you’re working on the client-side. 
I will start bike app in my country. Shortly rent a bike ☺️
I'm not sure I agree with your comments on Xcode, but I hadn't realized that indeed after dot Net was open source, it wouldn't be logical to keep Swift closed. Very interesting observation. 
I *believe* this will work. Their JSON schema isn't that well documented so I might have missed something. I can't test it since I don't have an API key: import Foundation struct TimeSeriesData { let date: Date let data: [Float] } extension TimeSeriesData : Decodable { init(from: Decoder) throws { var container = try from.unkeyedContainer() self.date = try container.decode(Date.self) var floatData: [Float] = [] while !container.isAtEnd { try floatData.append(container.decode(Float.self)) } self.data = floatData } } enum Order: String, Decodable { case asc, desc } enum Frequency: String, Decodable { case daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual } enum Transform: String, Decodable { case diff, rdiff, rdiff_from, cumul, normalize } struct DatasetData: Decodable { let limit: Int? let columnIndex: Int? let columnNames: [String] let startDate: Date let endDate: Date let frequency: Frequency let data: [TimeSeriesData] let collapse: Frequency? let order: Order? } struct TimeSeries: Decodable { let datasetData: DatasetData } if let url = URL(string: "https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/FB/data.json?api_key=YOURAPIKEY") { URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) -&gt; Void in guard error != nil else { print("Error: \(String(describing: error))") return } guard let response = response as? HTTPURLResponse else { print("Bad Response") return } guard response.statusCode == 200 else { print("Response: \(response.statusCode)") return } guard let data = data else { print("No data") return } let formatter = DateFormatter() formatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd" formatter.calendar = Calendar(identifier: .iso8601) formatter.timeZone = TimeZone(secondsFromGMT: 0) formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "en_US_POSIX") let decoder = JSONDecoder() decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .formatted(formatter) decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase if let result = try? decoder.decode(TimeSeries.self, from: data) { print(result) } } .resume() }

Wow. Checking it out. Thanks. Like the part: We'll save you 100's hours of development time. How can I resist? :-) 
Previously, I am using Xcode 9.3, I can't update my code until I fix my bugs 
Thank you 
OP himself didn't put in a lot of effort either, with the typo stakcoverflow typo in the title.
I posted via phone, so i made a typo or two. What code would help in this situation? I put fonts in my apps more then 10 times and this is the first time i see something like this so am i just asking if anyone had this issue?
Have you created a minimum test case? I've done so, and was able to reference the fonts without any problem, see also the following link: [https://github.com/bvankuik/MontserratFontTest](https://github.com/bvankuik/MontserratFontTest) Clone it and run it on your device. Mine shows the three Montserrat versions I included in the project, and I didn't reference them in IB.
Hi, thank you, i will try that now.
Solved it, while adding font to info plist it was added only to one target.
Solved!
A Swift array internally is a struct: the struct portion of the array is always copied around on assignments because it is a struct and structs do not know any different Despise that, this struct internally references a \*class\* object which contains the actual array data (you can find it looking for ContiguousArrayStorage in Swift sources), this object is only copied around "on demand", because it is a class object and does not have value-type behaviour. When you pass the array as a regular parameter a new Array is created anew (copying the struct portion of it, which contains almost no information) but the actual array data contained by the referenced object is not copied: the new Array struct still references it. If you make a mutable copy with "var b = a" the same thing happens again (so now you have three different arrays, a, b and the array you had outside the function scope, that all internally point to the same blob of data). When you finally try to make changes to b with b.removeAt the code will check whether that blob of data containing the actual array content is UniquelyReferenced and since it is shared by other it will create a new copy of it and only after that it will edit it. If you pass as inout you are only passing the address of the struct itself, thus no copying will happen at all, not even for the struct portion of it, unless the array passed as inout was itself a mutable copy of some other array and the internal ContiguousArrayStorage is not UniquelyReferenced at the time of the function call.
A minimal test case would greatly have helped, since people could copy/paste the ViewController to test in a small project.
I think there's a demo around from 1988 where it's demonstrated running on a NeXT Cube competing against a IBM workstation but I can't find it anymore. Steve Jobs rocking IB on OpenStep: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0CbKYUFTY
You'll have to accept that writing layouts is a complex task that you'll need to learn just like threading, compiling programs and writing Swift. CSS is hard too. Doing great elastic layouts for multiple resolutions in Windows is hard too. There are just a few things you really need to understand about auto layouts but they're never explained to you by IB. You need to learn about them. A lot of people that complain about auto layouts don't even know what compression resistance or content hugging really are.
You're talking about the actual UI rather than just code? They should be the same as on your old monitor unless you've changed the scaling on the 4k monitor. Something along these lines: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193723/scaling-all-ui-elements-when-using-an-external-monitor Also: https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/4k-monitor-retina-mode/ ###edit: There's also this app which I've never tried but apparently it allows more control over your monitor resolutions and scaling: [SwitchResX](http://www.madrau.com) And one more which I've never tried: [Retina Display Menu (RDM)](https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM)
Scaling worked. I probably would have figured that out eventually, but Xcode is the only thing I've really run on this thing so far. Thanks.
I dislike storyboards a lot! I inherited a project this year that was built with storyboards and it’s been a huge pain in the ass. I prefer doing everything in code.
Glad to help.
Yes. Mixing C++ with Objective-C is Objective-C++. The point of the article is talking about how create Swift code and Objective-C code which work well together: * using types in Swift which can work in Objective-C (no structs, using NSObject subclasses, etc...) * how to isolate implementation between the languages * how to make Objective-C methods utilize try...catch blocks in Swift * how to denote Objective-C pointers as whether they are actually Optional or not
In case it helps, Mac has a great screen zoom feature. Once turned on in System Preferences -&gt; Accessibility, you can zoom in and out by holding the Control key and scrolling the mouse or trackpad.
You can also change the system font/Ui size in system preferences. [Explanation](http://osxdaily.com/2016/05/23/increase-system-text-size-mac-os-x-scaled-resolution/)

Thanks this is helpful. They only supplied the file name itself with no path. 
I’m so sick of trashy products using clickbait blog posts and conference talks for advertising. Disgusting bull shit.
Yeah me too, so I’m confused why you think this is one of those. What’s trashy about Periphery? The article is step by step instructions for using it, how is that remotely clickbait?
Deprecated, am I right?
Any specific problem with core data?
Embark Market 
You are capable of it, you just have to learn it dude
I’m with you on that but part of the way we learn and learn how to do things correctly is by looking at existing code. It gets to a point where you’re asking to see code that is essentially the type of stuff companies like Lyft spend a lot of money to maintain and keep proprietary, though. OP should ask the community directly for help with CoreData. 
Thanks, I would really like to learn it, but currently I really don’t have time for it, so I need fast solution for my lil problem

If your code has all these bugs to fix, how did it compile in Xcode 9.3? You can update your code. When you update to a major new Xcode version, there is a new version of Swift, which can break code that used to compile with no errors. Using Apple's tool to update your code will correct most of these issues. It is easier than manually fixing each of these issues.
Hopefully it’s in the same directory they compile your source from. Otherwise they should have a note with the file path.
Can you elaborate please?? :)
It's similar to learning Math, it is fine to take a peek at the answer page when you are really stuck and can't figure it out, but make sure you understand how/why the formula works when you flipped over to the answer page. Else you are just copying answer and when the exam comes, you might suffer 😅.
If you just wanna increase the font size, try CMD + 'plus sign'.. And to reduce it, try CMD + -

I think it is no important what way you choose but you need just be persistent your learning. Then after a month or two you for sure get some notable result.
Best place to start is to dive in :-) Maybe do some prototypes of stuff first "here's how I can represent a board with the dice. Here's how I can make the moves", then if you like it, add it in to your main app. Then add in the rules (e.g. can't move diagonially on a thursday) and keep score, so you'd be able to play a game with another human. Then add the AI. Since you don't have a huge depth of experience in software development, before trying to design all the things up front, I'd definitely do some fun hacking and then decide to keep/throw out/re-write. Don't be afraid to throw stuff away and re-implement in a better way. You're going to learn a ton along the way :-) Also, use source code control (like git, ideally hosted off of your machine). It can be a giant undo button. "oh crap, the last two weeks totally messed up the app and I hate what I've done"
I'm ready to dive in. So the board has intersection points where the pieces go. Would starting by labeling those be the best way? Kinda like a battle ship grid system? (this is far less complicated than that) I'm honestly a bit overwhelmed. I think because I've been playing the game physically. None of my programing, also, had any screen output. The C++ for the aurdino was all for a "sensing" robot ie "spin 1 wheel when light input is = to XYZ" or "stop if sensor X is hit" etc. Thank you for the idea about source code control...that sounds very good. 
Envato Market as stated ahead, or [Open-source Apps repo](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/blob/master/README.md) on Github, where you can find finished products of high standards.

I'd probably start without any display at all - have some data structures, and print them out. You could use a playground to do a lot of the work (although I find playgrounds to be extremely frustrating). (I haven't internalized the rules), but could build a board by having an array of array of things-in-the-space. Have a class with a call like "set(diceType: d20, atRow: 5, column: 6)" which would add the die to that square. Then have something that loops over the rows and columns and prints out the board. Verify that you've got the right stuff. maybe jot down the high-level features and behaviors, and pick the ones that feel most interesting. This is going to be a fairly long-haul project, so follow what's calling you :-) If you've got a local meetup / CocoaHeads, show up with your app / idea, and show off what you've gotten so far. Folks may have specific suggestions on stuff to try next. 
but yeah, this sounds like a cool project. Back in the OLD days of the Mac (in college) I did a Risk game (click on territories, etc), and learned a TON. The code was understandably terrible, but boy was it fun to do.
Thank you!!!
”Using design patterns” 
Yeah I think there is going to be a lot of on-the-spot learning going on. That is part of the fun.
It does sound pretty "WEBSCALE"-ish 😂, but I checked the repo and they're talking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern. I bought the gang of four "Design Patterns" book awhile ago, and I still remember flipping through it and checking out the Command Pattern. At the time I had no idea how undo/redo was implemented, and thought it was pretty cool and easy to understand
So the game board is a modified [9 Mens Morris](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Twelve_Men%27s_Morris_board.svg/220px-Twelve_Men%27s_Morris_board.svg.png). I can take a picture if you're interested. &amp;#x200B; Each player starts at one side (2 players). The center spot in front of them is their "home" position they are trying to defend. If the opposing player gets to your home, they win. &amp;#x200B; You can choose to add a dice (at any of the "home row" points) or move a dice. If the dice travels to a crossroad that is occupied then they battle. I have access to "dice" code so this will be the simplest part. Player 1 roll D20 = 6. Player 2 roll D12 = 10. The # guide lists that this would mean that player wins. In the game numbers, 1-20 are assigned so a D6 isn't necessarily weaker than a dice with more numbers. It's balanced out by the fact that a D4 can move up to 4 spaces in one run, whereas a D20 can only move 1. The others fall somewhere in between. There are actually somewhat complicated statistics behind it but in the end, I have a very simple list. The worst part is getting several draws/ties in a row--but the kids really really seem to think that's an asset, not a drawback. &amp;#x200B; I've even factored in a "going first" equalizer. &amp;#x200B; It's just figuring out how to code it...and display it...that's getting me. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; There are a number of good **iOS Dev podcast:** **podcasts:** You have "a number of" a plural thing, not a singular thing. How do you not know this?
Ok, I get it, so I'm setting up what can happen on the board first then dealing with the dice. That's a good idea. In the creating of the game my primary focus was on the stats so thinking of the board as a controlling asset actually makes sense digitally. Mine actually deletes and adds some connections to facilitate the capture the flag element, but the same principle applies in the sectioning.
Huh? Not according to [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional/1539476-map).
So I managed to clean up the audio. First, I had to correctly configure the audio format. I needed mono and it was trying (and failing) to put out stereo. I also was able to change the sample rate there, which had been a problem of mine. Second, I moved the declaration of the audio buffer into the "play" function. Finally, I changed the scheduleBuffer call to just "self.player?.scheduleBuffer(buffer!)". That got it all working. 
My biggest struggle with auto layouts was using a scroll view. Used to be super painful. Then I read the documentation, and wouldn’t you know, I now have now trouble setting up a scroll view with auto layout. I personally have no issue using auto layout programmatically or in IB. It’s super powerful and takes care of a lot of the dynamic stuff for you. Apple have improved the required boilerplate code for setting up constraints heaps in the past few years, and I suspect they’ll improve on it still in the next few years. 
I'm working on a PSK31 encoder and decoder to throw into a rig controller for my ham radio set. It's just a side project to cope with grad school lol.
Thanks for answering! That was very helpful!
&gt; decode a signal with a baudrate of 31.25 What's the nature of this signal? You probably have to sample at twice that rate to adequately capture it without significant aliasing, according to the [Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist–Shannon_sampling_theorem).
It's a PSK31 signal. Two sine waves are mixed together. If the phase relationship between them stays the same for one sampling period (0.032S), that represents a 1. If they undergo a 180 degree phase shift, that represents a 0. I've been playing around with it some more and I can alter the buffer size only if I request one greater than 1/10 the sample rate. So I can request 4900 and receive a buffer with 4900 values in it. Now if I understand what you're telling me, I should be shooting to capture 16mS of data or 768 bins at a rate of 48KHz. Is that correct? 
I've been programming for money for almost 30 years now (geez I'm old), and I almost always approach things in that iterative manner. I call it Dopamine-Driven Development. Get a whole lot of little successes to keep up the momentum. If you've got a local meetup / cocoaheads (knoxcoca runs a general Cocaheads Slack), those are great for making contacts to help you over small humps. "I've got this compiler error I've been staring at for 10 minutes and have no idea what it says". Those can _totally_ derail enthusiasm for the day. 
I am continuing to work on https://appreviewbot.com - a tool that I made to get your iOS app store customer reviews posted to Slack as soon as they happen! I'd love you anyone to try it out and let me know their feedback.
Right. I tried to sample at 8KHz and got a weird error from the installTap function so I upped it to 48KHz. But that means that one bit is contained in 1536 samples. Now, I can request an integer multiple of that, say 6144 samples. That means I'd be attempting to decode four bits at a time but I can probably do the bookkeeping to account for that. I still don't see why I can't request 1536 samples and actually get a buffer of that size.
Just a side note. You shouldn't have to google the answers, The teachers guide should have them all there too.
That’s a fair point and I think it doesn’t in terms of what it achieves, But on the other hand I wanted to show how one can go about doing that from scratch to help people learn about how to use design patterns in ARKit apps. So the advantage is that by showing the implementation, it can help people learn
this guy (OP) has no clue about anything it seems. He's writing frameworks but does not know how to read documentation. Yeah right...
* XCode being slow has nothing to to with swift * Swift being open source is not remotely related to this post about array performance problems * Visual Studio Code is not an IDE. It's an adjustable JS editor
Why would you ever do this. Stick to the human interface guidelines from apple.
Creating shape layers in `draw(rect:)` is demonstrably wrong. You're recreating the layer *every* frame! The layer's styling should be done on instantiation and the resizing done on `layoutSubviews()` 
Yeah, agreed. But a design decision like this make me uninstall the app right away. 😏
I will fix it 😊. Thx for the hint
Perhaps the app is about the curvature of spacetime.
One thing you may want to do before just diving in is going through the [App Development with Swift book from Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11). They have a few examples in there that would probably be helpful for you as far as gameplay display and just general language and app development knowledge.
Then tell the designer to read and follow those guidelines. They are there for a reason. And any bs on limiting the design is just that, bs.
I think many people come in contact with AutoLayout primarily through Interface Builder and Storyboards, which to be honest, is a horrible experience. Setting up many constraints correctly in IB has always been rather painful. Clients demanding use of IB is sad to hear, really shoudn't be that way. I'd try to consult with client on that. I find using AutoLayout in code, combined with a syntax sugar library, is a lot more usable and works well in most cases.
Thanks for your comment. The lack of sample code in Swift has been very frustrating. I'm coming to believe that either the Swift APIs weren't designed for this sort of thing or I might be the first to try to use them in this way. I ultimately found that I could generate audio at specific sample rates through use of the AVAudioBuffer class, but I'm still mystified by a few things there. For instance, it allows you to select a common format of int16, which would be great, except that the program crashes when I try to use that. Float32 works, but I'm still getting some audio distortion and kinda wonder if that's the cause. On the receive side, there appears to be a hardcoded minimum latency. It will not serve up a stream from the microphone any sooner that every 100mS from the looks of it... That's probably good enough for most applications but in mine it's a problem. I also wish that AudioSession were available on macOS. It seems Apple put their better audio processing tools on iOS instead :/ Oh well. 
But you are adding a new layer every time draw is called, *without removing the previous one*. You do not control when draw is called; it can be triggered by any number of events outside of the scope of the view. Performing the draw operations directly in draw can be inefficient but it is a legitimate use of the function. Adding a new layer each time it is called will lead to multiple layers building up over time which is not only inefficient but can cause all sorts of visual glitches. The layer should be added exactly once and updated as needed when the bounds change.
Look at the new version. The layer is now replaced every time. That means only one layer and no Ui glitches.
Do some reading on SpriteKit. It's a great toolset.
If they tell you to fuck off, which is 90% of the time, what would you do? What if your employer paid a lot for that design? How much corporate drama is worth your time and effort as a developer? It comes down to the culture of the company, whether they value doing things right over getting more done. So i dont think is that simple to tell the designer to follow the apple guidelines. 
Have you tried restarting both devices? It sounds like the port it wants to bind to is already taken (which I’ve experienced a few times when my app would crash it wouldn’t have properly unbound). There’s no way of fixing this error state other than a reboot (to my knowledge) or choosing a different port (which sometimes isn’t feasible, like when you don’t pick the port ala multipeer)
Any PO will not like the risk of app rejection. Take the PO and higher up the food chain in the reasoning why. And when a designer does not follow the ROE in iOS app dev, it is time to run. The UX/UI should be thought out in collaboration with developers, architect, backend and PO When a company pays just for a design and not validate if the design is possible, under the restrictions of SDK’s and HIG, really start running. And yes you can ‘design’ anything in photoshop, does not mean it will be happing using the SDK or be approved when send for review.
You should avoid building UI like this, go back to the designer and point them to the HIG
MultipeerConnectivity* How many devices are you trying to connect? In my experience, &gt; 4 devices means a complete nightmare. I don't trust MultipeerConnectivity to operate as expected at all.
I think putting an action button within thumb’s reach is valuable to the user. The default location is a dead zone on anything bigger than an SE
Pointing out the fact that you lose all built in accessibility features and incur higher maintenance costs over time (what happens if apple changes / improves UITabBar in a future iOS? You’d get this benefits “for free” if you stayed stock) Are good ways to push back against non standard designs. Also consider all the built in safe area / parent child / presentation logic you’re throwing away. I think it’s also smart to look at this through a value perspective. Given that you’re discarding all the stuff listed above, and doing more work to get something that does less (are you making sure this will work for blind users? Right to left languages?) does this work add more value to the customer / business than the standard tab bar would have done? Could the developer time writing this and fixing bugs be better used in content / features that matter to the user or business? Delight features and things that differentiate your app are important, but they should be applied with good reason and thought. Core navigation features are rarely the place to do this!
FWIW I believe Google's Material Components already have a notched bottom bar, which should cover something like this. 
Sometimes you don’t have a choice. Pick your battles. 
Lol, you don’t get rejected from the App Store for doing something like this...
No I’m only trying to connect two devices and that shows up, it’s highly unreliable 
 I have two problems I am dealing with incorporating CoreData that might be the same. Once is crashing trying to fetch the Document class and the other is how to use instance variables with NSManaged objects. Here is the set up of my data model for the Document class. I have a custom subclassed NSManagedObject called Document. On this document, I want to have the ability to store a Title/Tag (just a string), a Category (another managedObject), a SubCategory (managedObject), an Occurrence (time interval, 2 weeks, month, year, managedObject), an Occurrence Start Date (Date), and finally a Document date. In the app settings, a user would create their own categories and each category could have its own sub categories. When they take a photo, or import a file, I have a custom class EditViewController that allows them to add the above properties to the photo and then save it all to CoreData as a Document class. The users Categories and SubCategories from the app settings would be populated to a PickerView that they could choose here. What works now: I started by setting up the Category / SubCategories as custom NSManagedObject subclasses. In the CoreData dataModel file, I have defined them each as entities with a ’name’ (string). The codegen is set to Category/Extension and generates the properties in the background. Then I set up a relationship between them as follows: Category to SubCategory (many to one) and SubCategory to Category (one to many), did the inverse relationship etc. I am able to fetch the related subCategories for each Category as expected. What doesn’t work: I tried to create the larger Document data model by adding all of these properties/attributes as attributes in the dataModel file. For the custom classes, I set them to transformable and picked the correct custom class in the inspector. Although I seemed to be able to save this to core data (I was able to print document.category.name etc after the try.context.save(), when I tried to do any fetching, my app crashed hard. I get **-\[companyOfOne.Category initWithCoder:\]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x283e559a0** I have read that I should set up my custom NSManaged subclasses as relationships to the Document entity rather than attributes but I wasn’t able to get very far with that. This seems to at least save, its the fetching I am struggling with. Thoughts: I use an instance variable at the top of my view controllers to reference the functions in my custom classes. For example I create an instance variable var category = Category() then category.createCategory() to call these functions and to access the array (category.categories). But I get an error **error: CoreData: error: Failed to call designated initializer on NSManagedObject class 'companyOfOne.Category'** So I think that my problem might be all connected. If I can figure out how to properly initialize the instance variable for my NSManaged Object, my fetch may work. So I am thinking that I could try two other ways: var category:Category? but this cascades through my code and requires a lot of changes that I am hesitant to make just to test. or var category = Category(context:AppDelegate.viewContext) Definitely feel overwhelmed and I can’t seem to find any CoreData tutorials that are not very basic. I know this is a wall of text but I also have pictures of my coreData model file if that would help. Thanks!
iOS btw
Resolved it: deinit { NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: UIApplication.willChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification, object: nil) } func registerObservers(){ NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(deviceOrientationWillChange), name: UIApplication.willChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification, object: nil) } @objc func deviceOrientationWillChange() { self.layout?.clearLayoutCache() } &amp;#x200B;
there is no such thing as ¨cheating¨ when learning something. take in as much material as you can. one of my favs methods is to explore Wikipedia on topics, especially their category pages. 
Yes, use relationships and you get them saved and restored automatically. Otherwise implement initWithCoder and initialize your properties from the Codable object passed. Relationships are much easier and the proper way.
Ahh, you didn't say what platform you were on so I assumed it was iOS. Are you doing this on macOS? I should have a bit of example code for you soon, it's been a while since I messed with the audio frameworks and I have to re-familiarize myself with a few things.
Oh, it's highly unreliable alright. Are you using Apple's chatroom sample code? Try getting that to work, then let devices sleep and wake up. Restart the app a few times. You'll get ghost sessions and ghost connections. It's super flaky and not even alpha quality. The limit of devices is supposed to be 8, but it starts randomly with disconnecting devices over 4 in one session. I'd steer away. MultipeerConnectivity is an utterly immature and unreliable technology. 
No I’m actually using there shared ar experiences sample code as I’m trying to replicate something like that for my ar app, and I really don’t know what other options I have. 
I also assumed you were on iOS. Anyway, I don’t think Apple even recommends Objective C for real time audio processing let alone Swift. There are very tight time budgets and there are samples in C and C++ that are probably still valid. 
I agree with all of what you’ve said. But I’ve had many conversations with designers about this. I get very little traction on accessibility, which is frustrating. And designers have told me that they feel that an app that uses standard controls feels “cheap”. I tried to find good examples of Apple Design Award-winning apps, but unfortunately they seem to have a lot of custom controls as well. There seems little incentive for designs to use standard controls, even from Apple. 
Hig specifically states that the tab bar shall be used for navigation and not actions. While remaining on the bottom of the screen. This instance doesn’t violate hig outside of the fab which could potentially be an action, but that being said is the fab really part of the tab bar?
From what I can tell, this implementation is only overriding the drawing of the tab bar, and so should still retain all the stock features of the UITabBar. However, I agree with using standard Apple practices. Designers hate using them, because it makes the app look cheap. Custom made implementation is more time, more designed, and looks like it (obviously this isn’t a hard rule, over design can make it look super tacky). This is where the UX guru needs to step in and make a call. Personally, I think this would be better implemented as a button incorporated into the tab bar, instead of the tab bar avoiding it. That’ll solve the weird misplacement of the other two buttons, as the tab bar is currently spacing them on the assumption that there is only two buttons. 
Yup, you hit the nil on the head IMO. There’s design and then there’s UX. You don’t want something to just look different for the sake of being different. Different doesn’t mean better. If you can design a better experience that improves something, then go for it! I feel like it’s hard to design a good UX around content, but easy to go bananas with navigation elements and decorations. All that being said though, content is king, and even really confusing and non standard apps like Snapchat become incredibly successful. 
The flatMap overload on optionals that works like the new compactMap is deprecated, yes. 
I guess you managed to do so anyway ;)
their* shared AT experiences there indicates a location Come on. If you can't handle the intricacies of there, they're and their, why should anyone spend *their* time helping you with vastly more complicated stuff, such as this?
You don’t have to be a grammar nazi I was typing quickly in the cold and I wasn’t thinking to much about grammar, and personally I don’t see how my bad grammar would deter anyone from helping me. And by the way it’s *AR not AT 
That's a totally legit reason to write a program.
There's [only one flatMap method on Optional](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional/1540500-flatmap), and it does not appear to be deprecated.
Ah, yes I'm doing this on macOS. Sorry for the lack of specificity. 
NSTableView would be the obvious Mac choice class for a board where pieces are placed/dropped if they're in squares on a grid. UITableView (nested) or UICollectionView on iOS. If they're hex or more complex, then that's a different answer. Also, have you looked at the [Fox sample code for SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/Fox/Introduction/Intro.html)? At its heart it is a piece moving around on a board. It's also like 1000 lines of code, very small for what it does. Also, the Swift Playgrounds app on an iPad is similar and goes through teaching you how to do the very kinds of things you're asking about.
You can now (finally!) use `#error` to stop compilation. It's interesting that it took Swift until 4.2 to gain this. Other compiled languages like ANSI C, Common Lisp, and C# have been able to do this since their first version, decades ago. Surely Swift's designers could have anticipated the need for it. There were ways to fake it in Swift before, but they were clumsy, and you couldn't easily include a message. You had to write something that was superficially valid syntax, but wouldn't pass compilation. 
Thank you so much I thought it was a problem with my code but I restarted both devices and it worked🙏
I don’t think that’s possible off the top of my Head (or even allowed for security reasons) but maybe you could perform a network request with the code and then return the output? 
Network Request?
Like pass in JSON with the code the user inputs and it returns the compiled object. 
Already tried that and it didn't work. I figured it out! Thanks!
**Solved!** &amp;#x200B; [NMSSH](https://github.com/NMSSH/NMSSH) also supports Swift if you use Cocoapods or bridging headers
Multi-language IDE for iPad
Is it possible from a Mac server through SSH?
I would look into setting up Xcode Server as a CI tool myself. Not sure what your goal is though.
Trying to make a swift IDE for iPad. I need to compile remotly
It would need to be compiled on a computer running Mac OS X with a compatible version of the Xcode toolchain. You could then SSH to that system and use `xcodebuild` to trigger the builds.
Thanks! I'll try that!
This sounds like a cool project! I've been looking for a C/C++ or Java "IDE" that world do something like this. Code on the iPad, and compile/run on a remote server. Is this what you're planning to do? If so, need any help coding? 🙂
Your intuition about the Enum constants is correct, they cannot be nil because they’re constants. The issue lies in the fact that the type being switched over is `Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;`, which doesn’t pattern match against values of type `SetCard.cardColor`. You, instead, need to write your patterns to match `Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;`. Looking at Optional’s definition shows how you can write these patterns: enum Optional&lt;Wrapped&gt; { case some(Wrapped) case none } Since there are 2 cases in Optional, you need to pattern match against both of them. switch card?.color { case Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;.some(SetCard.cardColor.red): drawColor = UIColor.red case Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;.some(SetCard.cardColor.green): drawColor = UIColor.green case Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;.some(SetCard.cardColor.purple): drawColor = UIColor.purple case Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;.none: print(“no color specified?”) } Now, that’s _incredibly_ verbose, compared to the previous example. Note that we also had to handle the `none` case, which is what’s missing from your original example. Swift actually has a feature that will cut down on this boilerplate: type inference. Since the compiler knows you’re matching against `Optional&lt;SetCard.cardColor&gt;`, you can skip restating the types, and let the compiler figure it out for you: switch card?.color { case .some(.red): drawColor = UIColor.red case .some(.green): drawColor = UIColor.green case .some(.purple): drawColor = UIColor.purple case .none: print(“no color specified?”) } That’s much more readable! But we’re not done yet. Since matching over optionals is such a common thing in Swift, there’s a little bit of syntactic sugar we can apply. There’s a special pattern syntax that’s equivalent to `.some(value)`, and that syntax is spelled by adding a `?` to the end of the pattern. So we can rewrite the previous version to: switch card?.color { case .red?: drawColor = UIColor.red case .green?: drawColor = UIColor.green case .purple?: drawColor = UIColor.purple case nil: print(“no color specified?”) } And the compiler will only match the first case if `card?.color` is: - non-`nil`, and - contains `SetCard.cardColor.red` Also, as a side note, in Swift we usually prefer to name types with TitleCase and values with lowerCamelCase, so we’d prefer you name that inner enum CardColor. And since it’s inside an enum called `SetCard` it can probably just be called `Color`. Namespacing is great! Hope this helps!
this is aazav's thing, you can ignore him.

Awesome. If nothing else, it's fun and a confidence builder.
Apple actually has you covered in iOS 12: Shortcuts can run shell commands through SSH.
Actually it was created with iOS in mind. It depends on libraries that are available for macOS and tvOS . I have actually added a Package.swift file so it can also work with SPM so in theory it should work on linux. If not, I would be happy to co-opeate on this to bring it to linux
Sometimes—I am trying to make my code clean, tight and efficient. It’s often more than the game is asking but it’s good to figure out and really be refreshed. For the most part they’ve turned it into such a game that it doesn’t feel like learning—which is more than I can say for my cobol class back in the day.
Thanks for your advice! I am actually looking at lots of different solutions for my app. Realm, FireStore, CloudKit, CoreData... but I'm stubborn and want to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each. 
Probably not ideal for this situation. 
Angela Yu’s iOS 11 and swift 4 class is pretty good.
I ended up finding something finally. Just took hours of research to get what I wanted and to implement it using cocoa pods. But I agree with you. I’m just picky lol. 
my question was genuine dude!
sure it was pal, just like all the others'. ;) don't even bother searching the sub, or god forbid, the internet....
Take the iTunes U course by Stanford university. It‘s great - and free. 
can't upvote you enough
Great article. You just got new reader. Thank you.
indeed. I wish we would see more submissions like this 
It would be great if people who downvote this would also say why they disagree. Otherwise it has no value and it’s rather trolling than anything else
&gt; For the most part they’ve turned it into such a game that it doesn’t feel like learning […]. That was my experience too and why I often open the app before bedtime to play for a bit. 
Thanks so much. This worked!
I think if there’s something people should be fed up with in this sub, it’s you and your comments. I quickly went through several of your comments and not just you add absolutely NOTHING to the conversation, you are often just attacking other people and apparently this is not the only sub you do this. If you don’t plan to discuss, participate in conversation or help but rather just keep posting meaningless comments (which are often aimed against other people), I think it’s better for you to unsubscribe and leave
not often, always aimed againts spamming people. and yes, in all the subs. I believe most people subscribe to subs for content, but happy to see that you'd rather get rid of people instead of these bullshit spam submissions. way to go, pal!
Does it makes sense now?
Nice read! I’d definitely subscribe if you had an email subscription option. Otherwise I’ll just forget. 
Glad to see John’s articles here. He is great.

Well, my first iOS client, I charged $40/hr. That was dumb. My second iOS client, I am charging $150/hr. Both are contracts I have landed. Note, for both of these, it also required substantial work in Java, Javascript (alongside a minimal amount of HTML/CSS) and Postgres, in addition to the Swift front-end
Quick easy and fast solution with assumption that matrix is a square. ``` func diagonalDifference(arr: [[Int]]) -&gt; Int { // let numberOfRows = arr.count var firstDiagonalSum = 0 var secondDiagonalSum = 0 for index in 0..&lt;arr.count { firstDiagonalSum += arr[index][index] secondDiagonalSum += arr[index][arr.count - 1 - index] } return abs(firstDiagonalSum - secondDiagonalSum) } ```
We generally charge $125/hr if the clients and projects are reasonable. We have a lot more than 2 years of experience, though, but also a low tolerance for shitty work. 
Start learning SpriteKit for 2D games, or SceneKit for 3D games.
And how many hours a day do they work ?
What??? I charge $40/h and I thought I was expensive. Also, I'm from Argentina, so here (and anywhere in latin america) that's a lot of money. I wonder if me moving to the US would help me charge +120 as others are suggesting.
It can be 8 or more during crunch time, but realistically at our (50+) old ages 6 billable hours/day is where we like to be. We're not one of those shops that charges 8 hours a day even if we were goofing off on Reddit for 2 of them. 
I’d say with a CS degree, 5+ years experience programming, and a couple of years experience in Swift you could easily command over $120/he on serious projects, $150 is not unreasonable. Less than that it falls off pretty quickly. Maybe $100/hr for a degree but not so much experience, maybe $50 for 5 years experience and a solid resume of apps and code. With just 2 years and little other experience it’s iffy to even get $25. The key is getting certified experience - courses at an accredited institution, working for a company with a decent reputation, being a big contributor to a major open-source project. All those will give a huge to boost the amount you can get per hour. And the ability to even get those kind of work offers. 
$40 for 5 years experience and a solid resume of apps and code? No that's way, way too low. A friend of mine got a development contract for $60/hour from a major car company for one year of experience. And I've seen his code - it's not great - he doesn't even totally under OOP. That's not Swift, but considering Swift has been changing so often, it's hard to find experienced devs in it, and it requires paying the Apple tax, $40 is bargain basement rates.
I’m not saying that it’s impossible, just that it’s increasingly rare to get something like that just self-taught and no professional experience. Of course there will be exceptions both high and low, depending on location, ability, and other factors.
Less concise code can often be easier to read and understand, which is particularly important when working in a team that is subject to change or hand-off. We need to remember to show restraint in such instances. That said, this was sort of neat. And I do like neat.
Is a solid resume and 5 years of experience not professional experience? I am self taught with a decent chunk of experience and at the very least, job offers come pouring in. I've found freelance contracts harder to find, but some of the ones I've come across have been pretty highly paying.
remotely* 
It can be but it doesn’t have to be. Depends on the type of experience, projects, and the person. I’ve met people with that kind of time who have gotten lucky or who have taken low-hanging fruit projects and their code is certainly not professional-quality. On the other hand there are some people that have worked very hard on their projects, learning and developing professional habits. 5 years of that type of work certainly qualifies as professional. Remember that we’re talking about around 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year to make a career out of it. That’s 2000 hours a year at $40/hour, which is 80k a year (pretax and other costs). For someone with only 5 years experience that’s pretty good. The key is finding enough work to get those hours.

Related question: self employed people here, how do you keep track of your billable hours?
Nice! This works great! 
FreshBooks. 
If you intend to be self employed you need to be fully aware of what it takes to run a business. If you want to make $70,000 a year, double that and compute your wages from that. You will be paying a lot of cash to things that support the business. Taxes can be a killer but you also have insurance and other unavoidable business related expenses.

Whichever route you take you'll be learning a language and then a framework (or game engine). Swift is a language. If you learn swift, your new knowledge will be helpful for games and non games. After an intro to swift, you can then learn to use SpriteKit (2D) or SceneKit (3D). These are apples frameworks for making games and use swift. Alternatively, you could choose javascript (language) and phaser (framework). Or C#(language) and Unity (framework). There are tons of other options too. If it's just for a hobby and you have a Mac + iOS device, I'd say swift/spritekit is a good choice. When looking for resources, I'd recommend first looking for an introduction to the swift language and then a course specific to game development. If you have any more specific goals, people might be able to offer more specific advice. Game dev is a huge field and there isn't one way to go about learning.
I'd guess when it grabs the user default for role_id it's not finding it and coming back with nil
Token id and userrole are optional values. Since your userrole is nil the error is thrown
He’s right, I think your idea of a fair rate is skewed low. When I was in college doing iOS dev with one year of experience I charged 50/hour and people readily agreed to it. I had no degree and was terrible at that time. When I was at my first job out of college with two years of experience my boss was billing me at 200/hr (which to be fair I thought was ridiculous) iOS is really expensive
You should change that **if** into an **if let** 
ok, I will try it.
Where is the value to user defaults set for string ? And you should avoid forceful unwrap and use either if let or gaurd let statements
ok, I will use guard statement. 
It would help a lot if you would say where you're based and what currency you're working for. 40 Argentine Peso is a bit different than 40 Canadian Dollars.
&gt; I charge $40/h and I thought I was expensive. Also, I'm from Argentina US$40 is pretty nice money for Argentina, US$25 is what a lot of people work for. I charge US$50 but it wasn't so easy to land the work. Training on algorithms and data structures to pass the interviews for companies that have a higher bar. Don't think it's impossible to land US$65 or perhaps even more. &gt; I wonder if me moving to the US would help me charge +120 as others are suggesting. If you can, do it.
US$50 / €50 per hour working remote from Argentina. I think I can raise it even more but that would require getting direct clients from the US or better paying ones from Europe. Working on raising my profile a bit and studying to get to that level. Tried to work many hours before but that doesn't work. It's better to get paid twice as much.
Could you be missing an IBoutlet link? Or maybe the button is trying to pull from the wrong variable name? Seems like whatever function is called when the button is pressed is receiving a nil value. Without looking too closely that would tell me that there’s a name mismatch or some kind of error when the button press function is called. 
Along with the other answers here... [Register Defaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults/1417065-register) Also, to prevent mistyping, you may want to create a struct or enum to hold the string values of your keys. 
Income is always a difficult subject to consider as an indie dev, especially if you live in the US and are coming from/used to being a salaried employee. There are all sorts of things to consider, not the least of which is the massive amount you’ll be paying to taxes and health insurance (which for employees is stuff that’s taken care of behind the scenes before you even get your check). So the number you ask for is usually a lot higher than most people feel comfortable asking for. I’m not an indie dev, so I can’t really tell you one way or another. But earlier this year I listened to an awesome couple of podcast episodes from Under the Radar, hosted by Marco Arment and David Smith who are both successful indie devs. They talk about all the things you need to know and think about when going indie. Each episode is only about 30 minutes so I highly recommend checking out these two episodes. https://www.relay.fm/radar/115 https://www.relay.fm/radar/116
This. Work from your desired salary backwards. If I was a Junior dev with 2 years of experience I’d want USD 80K. But you might want to do a cost of living calculation based on rent, transportation costs, food, etc. Then, factor taxes, insurance, and retirement. You’ll be surprised that you’ll likely need t charge a much higher hourly rate. You’ll be even more surprised that people will pay it. A lot of times, people higher contractors because of reasons you wouldn’t expect and money isn’t a problem.
I am sure that if you move to USA you could charge that much. But then you have to look at other things like cost of living and leaving everything behind to go to a new place. Is it worth it in the end? I am from Southeast Europe and I would rather stay here in my country making 1000 euros/dollars a month than move to USA and make 100k. Or maybe move to Western Europe and make some more money with bit more expenses for living.

I have cheap rent (under $1000 a month). What exactly are you spending all your money on? Are you building a free library? Helping kids with healthcare care issues, helping the homeless, doing free tutoring? What exactly do you need the $$$s for? Billions of $$$s are not going to get you one second more of life, not one second. Why have every waking moment of our life's consumed with MORE MORE MORE money. I code not for the $$$ (of course it's great), I want to put a "dent in the universe", that's all. :-) 
&gt;I have cheap rent (under $1000 a month). What exactly are you spending all your money on? You do realize there's other parts of the country and the world where it's more expensive to live, right? In the boston area, a rent under 1k is only really possible in a studio or shared apartment . I've paid 1500-1800 a month just on rent. My mortgage and property tax is about 2000 a month. Student loans eat up tons of income. Luckily for me those are done in 6 months. Unfortunately we live in a society where people are forced to sell their labor and "MORE MORE MORE money" is the only way they can secure their families.
In addition to some of the recommendations made already, Apple has two books available for free called "Intro to App Development with Swift" and "App Development with Swift" on their iBooks Store.

http://www.deathclock.com/ What's your date? The accuracy is astonishing. :-) I really don't think a Swift coder should make more than an ER MD, but that's just me. 
I realize this isn't actually answering your question, but have you considered using Unity instead? I suppose my answer depends on what you mean by "game". If you're looking to make something simple like a tic-tac-toe game, Swift and SpriteKit will work fine, but if you're trying to make something more complex than that, a game engine like Unity will make things much, much easier for you. If you decide you want to go with Unity, [check out their tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials).

Cost of living in Agentina is not what you assume it to be.
Well, I just looked it up on Google and it seems like it's similar to my country (Montenegro) while some things are significantly cheaper (like utilities and gas for a car). Salaries in Argentina seem higher than in my country. Anyway, I guess it varies a lot from place to place, just like anywhere else. I don't want to sound like a smartass because I don't know much about Argentina from personal experience. Just wanted to say that person above me should check cost of living and all other stuff in a new place before deciding to move out.
&gt;We need to remember to show restraint in such instances. I agree. At the bottom of the article it does mention this though, which is what was running through my mind as I was reading it as well lol.
I took a course years ago offered to people interested in starting their own businesses. I was a little bit shocked by some of the requirements. The idea of quarterly taxes was one of them. This is likely why so mAny businesses have working relationships with accountants and lawyers. Just more fees to pay that you can’t get away from easily. Anyone interested in going into business for themselves needs to do so with open eyes. There are rewards but man there is a lot of overhead. Let’s not even get into actually hiring somebody to work or you. 
What comes first? The money or the joy of writing code? Is it fun, or do people just do it for the $$$s? That's the real question. And how you separate out the true artists from "it's just a gig." Hardcore coders, they program on the weekends just fo fun. No one is paying them a penny. It's just to code. It's their life. Money is great, but they would hack code, no matter what someone pays them. 
My god How did I forgot about retirement planning. Anybody with a lick of sense will start putting away retirement funds immediately. In fact it is far better to suffer a bit in the early years to build that fund. Young people often dismiss this but it can make the difference between retiring when you are 40 or working until you are 90!!!! By the way nothing against working a bit, it does keep the mind sharp, but there is a difference between you have too and want too. 
&gt; What comes first? The money or the joy of writing code? Is it fun, or do people just do it for the $$$s? That's the real question. If people are writing code *as a job* you would presume they're doing it as a living and the argument that people who professionally code are greedy and undeserving of appropriate wages for their labor is completely ridiculous. Yes, there's people who have a passion for coding and contribute to open source projects all the time. There's people that do this on their free time while *also* working a full time job writing code for employers/clients. 
Hi bcornello! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that.

Let’s start from beginning: First Stage: Several couple medium small projects: $40 - $60 per hour just to get the contract and use it as reference. Also you get to speed with some things while doing these things. Second Stage: After first couple projects: you are realizing that you have to make graphics and code and debug and be QA for the whole project and client starts changing things in the middle of project that might require rewriting portion of code. $85 - $120 per hour. Third Stage: You already have good references and portfolio. Familiar with some popular third party libs. Opportunity to hire/subcontract backend guys to speed things up. $150 - and up. Another option is per whole project basis ( risky, but some clients like it better. ) you will need experience and confidence to quote $20,000 or $50.,000, etc for building custom project. You will need to have contract spell out everything out. I would recommend build it in stages and get paid for each stage finished. This way you minimize your risks. Some good freelancers could explain even more. You have to be very strong, business wise and also financially stable if no projects for several months or client(s) does not pay. Have multiple projects in pipe always helps. Everybody dreams about that. 
Square also recently released [Reader SDK](https://squareup.com/us/en/developers/reader-sdk), which lets you use Square hardware from your own iOS app: https://github.com/square/reader-sdk-ios-quickstart
Firebase is good, easy to start with REAT API. Includes all basic services you need: auth, noSQL database, serverless functions. Or you can give a try to small but tailored for developers serverless cloud where you can do the same things (and much more actually) as on Firebase but much easier. And you can use Swift for your backend! Sorry to promote our project, but this is exactly the backend for mobile apps https://swifty.cloud
pros: it's swift cons: good luck getting it (swift) to run on anything other than ubuntu. sadly linux support is still very sucky. I'd suggest you use one of the well established web languages. you can always rewrite later in swift if you wish
How difficult would it be to make an app that loads an STL file (a 3D model) and then lets you paint on it directly? I'm not even talking about complicated painting, just something like "color this skin area #ffe0bd, then the eyes #ffffff, then the other part... " Key requirements: * Importing the STL file * Rotating/zooming with multi-touch * Applying the colors, with Apple Pen support * Exporting the file in STL format From what I've gathered, there's no such app in the app store right now, so I'm thinking of trying to make it myself. How much of the heavy lifting can Swift do and how much will I have to figure out on my own?
https://youtu.be/qpDiXZRADfE
&gt;According to the Daily Mail if you make $34,000 a year you are in the top 1% in the world. Yeah and the cost of living in countries below that is also substantially cheaper. Just because India has a sixth of the world's population and an average salary of less than 10k a year doesn't really mean a person in NYC making 40k is rolling around like a fat cat 
"good luck getting it (swift) to run on anything other than ubuntu. sadly linux support is still very sucky. I'd suggest you use one of the well established web languages. you can always rewrite later in swift if you wish" Just use Docker.
Hey thank you so much! I will definitely have a look at your project, and if I get stuck or need any help I will send you an inbox or write to you guys. I love joining small projects and growing with them. 
If you use docker you can run it on any flavor of Linux.
There was a good episode about this topic on Under the Radar a while back. I can't find the link, but they were talking about what they do to build online services for their iOS apps. They basically recommend sticking to the big frameworks for building server-side applications, like Rails and Express. I dabble in server-side Swift, and it's a lot of fun. But it's sparsely charted territory. A lot of features you expect in server-side frameworks haven't yet been implemented in frameworks like Vapor, or the implementations are preliminary. And the Swift language is still rapidly evolving, as are the frameworks. On the other hand, frameworks like Rails are very stable, and pretty much any problem you could possibly have has been experienced by someone else and solved by someone else. So in the end, it kind of depends on what you want to do. If you need to build a server-side app that is reliable and takes the least amount of time to build, go with an established framework. If you want to explore things, get the advantages of Swift, and be part of something new, go with server-side Swift.
This might be a better question for /r/iOSProgramming, since Swift is a general-purpose language. To answer your question, it all depends on what you're building. You can't just say, "I'm building an app, should I use Firebase?" You gotta give us at least a little bit of context.
&gt;I don't want to have to say Why? Seriously, why is `nodes[i]` better than `units[i].node`? Hiding the top level array access behind a computed property obfuscates what is actually going on for a small syntactic change. There is benefit to hiding complexity in your code but I'd argue in this case that you're do the opposite - you're making it *more* complex and harder to understand and reason about. Unless, of course, you frequently need an array of Nodes to operate on but for individual accesses it doesn't make much sense. I'd be willing to bet that some future person reading your code will ask "Huh?" when they see that. And there are potentially performance considerations. You would be creating a whole new Array object (and incurring the performance hit of running map on N Units) constantly, even to access a single Node. Depending on your usage pattern that could really add up. A more performant pattern, but no less baffling, would be to use a function: `func node(_ at: Int) -&gt; Node { return units[i].node }` Then you could just call it with `node(i)`.
The basic fire as tutorial literally shows you how to make a messaging app, it all really depends on your needs but even if core data was needed, Firestone provides offline support “sort of” emulating a client side db, so Firebase all the way
I would say just use Firebase for it, unless you really want to build it yourself(which I totally get). 
Is any of the material for your labs available online? I don't understand your Enum Case Constructors Are Functions example. What's this functionality called so I can google it, and how do you actually use/call the example with Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;?
This is pretty cool, integration with Simulator would be super nice, if it's doable
copied on write though, so if op isn't mutating anything, no prob if they're structs
My need is just basically for member's to chat with each other and create group chats. I don't need to store their message so I'm just thinking storing it directly on CoreData as sent by FCM. I believe FCM will hold the message until it's received by the client successfully.

I used the Big Nerd Ranch Swift book (note: not the iOS Programming book... that is for after you know Swift) and thought it was great but that was before the Apple e-book other rave about now.
I’m not sure, I never used it. I just know that when it came out a year or so ago it was pretty popular around here. 
You should typecast the value to Int on the next statement, since you are unwrapping an optional data type, it should be unwrapped to the same data type In your code, you used two '!', that means you have to unwrap it twice, once for checking whether String? actually contains String and not nil and the second time to confirm whether typecasting is successful and not unsuccessful (nil)
The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4.2) 
yeah, sorry, but that's more of a joke. a whole container just for a compiler. come on.

The first question that comes to mind is do you really need server side support for your apps? Here is the thing, many apps these days require server side support and frankly that sucks. They waste my bandwidth and cause other grief. So that question often pops up in my mind, why does this app waste my bandwidth. That question has actually caused me to delete apps. In any event back to the question at hand, can you build server apps with Swift. The answer is certainly but that leaves oh the details. First the franeworks like Vapor Kitura and others are at best beta quality pre version one releases in my mind anyways. To put it simply they are not all there yet. That shouldn’t stop you though as everyf ramework in existence went through these phases of development. The other big problem isSwift itself which still isn’t stable. UTF8 support is scheduled for Swift 5 as is ABI stability. I would expect Swift 5 to bring a bunch of rewriting of the web frameworks to better support the new strings in Swift 5. Once Swift5 arrives and the intitial design changes digested we should see rapid development of Swift frameworks. One needs to remember that eve though we are at the Swift 4.2 release level this is still very much beta software. I’m ducking right now to avoid the arrows but let’s face it Swift has changed dramatically with each release. Swift 5 would slow that down completely. A stable binary interface is key to allowing platforms built upon Swift to move forward. So if your software is flexible with deployment timeframes I’d suggest finding Swift 5 betas to start to learn the last of the new features. About mid 2019 Swift 5 should be stable and some time after that frameworks should be requiring Swift 5. I guessing Swift 5 will be ready by or close to Apples WWDC in 2019. A year ago I might have delivered a different answer but at this point I don’t see the point in writing web software for old Swift when new Swift with new strings is so close. 
Is there a cap for how much a lone iOS dev can make? E.g, one that doesn't want to have employees, which is why he probably only takes clients who provide the team.

It would be awesome when available on Linux though.
Why be so toxic? It looks like you have quite the history of hate speach though. Take your casual racism back to the dregs. 
Yes. 
I also have some Python experience but still a newbie. I am currently working through App Development with Swift and I would definitely recommended starting there. Lots of links to online resources and the like. Good luck 😊
If you have programming experience with other languages (especially Objective-C and the Xcode IDE) you should take a look at Erica Sadun’s Swift Style [1]. It’s a style guide so it’s not going to teach you how to use Xcode/Interface Builder or how to structure an app, but will introduce you to a ton of language features including the more nuanced ones. All of that to say: if it isn’t your first book on Swift it should definitely be your second. Barnes and Noble seems to be $10 cheaper than Amazon right now. [1] https://m.barnesandnoble.com/p/swift-style-erica-sadun/1125298645/2676548782265?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_Core+Catch-All,+Low&amp;sourceId=PLAGoNA&amp;dpid=tdtve346c&amp;2sid=Google_m&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA_s7fBRDrARIsAGEvF8TqkU-Q1F1ENwJurbKZ_62l75rYtqq-IzTT-z5dTuyRrOgXLlSJ-RUaAp2lEALw_wcB
Yeah, I understand that it is bog so easy at this stage in comparison with go or python based backends, but my question is more about intensions. Is it worth trying to build it on Swift currently taking into account that it will grow and franeworks for it will be more stable. So, it is more about Swift benefits as a language itself.
I only have experience with Apple's books so I will talk about them, not sure about others but I guess they are good too. If you are feeling like a total beginner you can start with "Intro to App Development with Swift". It seems like it's aimed at teenagers/younger but it helped me (total newbie) grasp some concepts in programming. Work is mostly done in playgrounds. After that (or right away if you are feeling experienced enough) you can go with "App Development with Swift". First two chapters are going over same things (strings, functions, working with storyboards etc etc) but more in depth.
This! I guess using `.lazy` would remove the performance hit, I think it's overkill here. Nothing wrong with the first syntax
Can you share screenshot of what you’re trying to achieve? I don’t use Facebook so don’t know 🤷‍♂️
You can use a `WKWebView` but in general it’s good to use an `SFSafariViewController` - it’ll have access to Safari sessions, saved passwords, etc, but you won’t have access to its data. 
While \`lazy\` would address the performance issue, it would only make the potential confusion caused by this abstraction worse. A lazy property is computed just once so if the \`units\` array is updated after \`nodes\` is called the first time, the \`nodes\` property would never get updated! Then the two arrays would have no connection to each other and all kinds of side effects could come back to bite you.
 WebKit. It's just few lines of code.
I'm a solo founder and launched my very first mobile app in Swift just 5 months ago. Yesterday, I just finished redesigning the site. I'm now working on creating a messaging feature where members can chat one on one and create group chats. The app and site is called Dizkover - it's focused on discovering people. Let me know what you guys think.
I was thinking about .lazy, rather than a lazy var. Such as this: ``` var nodes: [Node] { return units.lazy.map({ $0.node }) } ``` will that break in the same way? I'm not sure. That said, it's a pointless argument because like you say: it's a bad idea right from the start
Thank you for your answer but how can I make it like Facebook app does? With this facy popup
It's for runtime as well
&gt; All of that to say: if it isn’t your first book on Swift it should definitely be your second. You rank it as a better or more important book than, say, Objc.io’s Advanced Swift or Functional Swift? Really? A style guide?
It helped me personally grasp a bunch of concepts moving from Objective-C. I think it’s a great book goes into a deep dive of the syntax which can be just as helpful as the more practical learn by example/exercise method in other books. I’m only speaking from my personal experience, no need for the tone.

Copy ok write is a feature of standard library types like string and array, not structs. Most structs are eagerly copied (and that’s a good thing! Copies are much cheaper than the refcounting and allocation copy on write requires when the amount of data is small)
CoW is not a general feature of structs. It's a feature that was explicitly implemented by standard library authors.
&gt; I think you're right that using a lazy collection that way would avoid the N-iterations over `units` Wouldn't it still incur an i-iterations cost over `units` as indexation becomes an O(N) operation, or does a mapped lazy sequence over an array still do O(1) access to the underlying item before mapping it? Still, if you wanted to go that route you'd probably be better off building your own proxy collection.
Docker containers are just cgroups + namespaces, right? Which one do you think is a joke?
I recommend you **iOS 12 Programming Fundamentals with swift.** [Book description here.](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920208655.do) This it's the book, in older versions (iOS 10), that I used to learn Swift. For more advanced questions, I use [Programming iOS 12](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-ios-12/9781492044628/). If you found it in older versions, like iOS 10 or 11 version, don't worry, for learn, it's enough.
If you’re wanting to learn swift specifically. There is a free Apple book called Intro to App Development with Swift. I’m using it in a class for my associates degree in computer systems. But the book itself sucks. It does provide information and such to run through in the playground through XCode. 
that's not an argument, bro. welcome to my blocklist for wasting my time.
Consider this valid code: enum Meow { case sound(catSound: String) case animal(animal: String) } let meow = Meow.animal(animal: "cat") switch meow { case .sound(let randomVarName): print(randomVarName) case .animal(let randomVarName): print(randomVarName) } This \^ runs fine. The pattern matching doesn't happen on the constructor variable names, it happens on the types. The name that you assign the variable within the switch statement is arbitrary. I'd recommend changing your enum names to something unique, like \`loginWithPhone\`, \`loginWithPassword\`, etc. Super unhelpful error message though
Does anyone know of any online intro courses to starting your own business / freelancing? 
No sure if this is posted somewhere else but instead the new LSP, JetBrains built their own engine for Swift (server side). Just wondering if anyone has used this?
Curious to hear about what the trouble is in serializing and deserializing JSON. I do it all the time, it's a piece of cake.

Got a couple of free promo codes - message me if you're interested.
The article says how developers might get really overwhelmed by implementing 'clean architecture' but then goes on praising Reactive Programming, RXSwift and such as if they are things 'every programmer must know'. Well, they don't. It would take more effort for a new engineer on your team to learn Rx than a separate architecture which uses standard constructs and concepts. 
Same here. 
I feel like MVC and delegate pattern which is encouraged by Apple and the Swift programming language is perfectly fine for apps of any size. You delegate functionality and build abstraction, there is no limit to it. I don't think loading up libraries and pods is the way to go for a clean architecture. Maybe some specific apps are better with reactive architecture such as a spreadsheet application.
&gt; Is any of the material for your labs available online? The sample code from each WWDC is available publicly from developer.apple.com. The content of the lab discussions is not documented, unfortunately. &gt; I don't understand your Enum Case Constructors Are Functions example. tl;dr Enum cases behave like [type constructors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_constructor) in functional programming languages. Allow me to expand: Consider the following types (with apologies to anybody with more than an undergraduate's interest in Chemistry): ``` protocol Compactable { var density: Double { get } } struct Water: Compactable { var density: Double { return 1 } } struct Mercury: Compactable { var density: Double { return 13.56 } } ``` And our generic `Glass` type and sample function from before ``` enum Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { case halfEmpty(Liquid) case halfFull(Liquid) } func outlook&lt;Liquid&gt;() -&gt; (Liquid) -&gt; Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { return Int.random(in: 1..&lt;100) % 2 == 0 ? Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfEmpty : Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfFull } ``` If we take a step back and just focus on the type of `outlook`, you'll notice it takes no arguments and returns a function that takes a `Liquid` and returns an instance of an enum carrying that liquid. A simpler version of a function with this might look like this ``` func pessimize&lt;Liquid&gt;() -&gt; (Liquid) -&gt; Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { return { liquid in Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfEmpty(liquid) } } ``` But you notice how this closure is taking its argument and immediately applying it to the enum case constructor? That makes it a perfect candidate for a rewrite in [point-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming) style. That is, we can mention the enum case constructor as a "function" without mentioning any of the arguments to it. Instead of giving us a value of the enum, this instead gives us a *function* that yields us that value. It's probably easier to see what that means in code: ``` func pessimize&lt;Liquid&gt;() -&gt; (Liquid) -&gt; Glass&lt;Liquid&gt; { return Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;.halfEmpty } ``` My example is just a variation on this, treating the enum case constructor "functions" as closure values, and adding a conditional expression just to make things more interesting. But if you take a step back even further, this is kind of weird, right? In C and Objective-C, an enum is just a bit pattern that happens to correspond to a syntactic form - it's a number that has a name given to it by the programmer. It's kinda strange to think of it instead as a *function that takes some arguments* (in the case of C et al, no arguments) and returns a value of the enum case to you. That would be incredibly inefficient versus just placing a constant in memory! But when you generalize to enums with associated values, it's this kind of abstraction, that of a function, that is the most natural way to implement these things. &gt; how do you actually use/call the example with Glass&lt;Liquid&gt;? So, putting this together, we can call this function and get a value back the way you would expect, by applying the returned closure value to some arguments: ``` let randomGlass1: Glass&lt;Water&gt; = outlook()(Water()) let randomGlass2: Glass&lt;Merecury&gt; = outlook()(Mercury()) ```
It's very simple to install swift on ubuntu though, and ubuntu servers are available everywhere.
I suppose you do it on ios device side. While on server side things are little bit different and you do no have things like Alamofire and SwiftyJSON on serverside swift. Maybe I am wrong... do you know how to use such tools with serverside swift?
Agree. Learning curve is steep, and down the line readability is also going to be an issue. One of the gripes with MVC is the use of a single massive view controller. Nowhere does it say in MVC that the whole screen needs to be one view controller. A lot of times you can device the screen in multiple view controllers, and thus maintain the single-responabilizty principle. 
If you translate MVC into every screen has one view controller, yes you might move into massive view controller fast. A lot of times you can divide the screen in multiple view controllers, and thus maintain the single-responabilizty principle. And for me CocoaPods are the biggest dependancy of the system. 
You’re absolutely right, as iOS developers (especially Swift devs) we ought to approach UIs the same way that we approach every other part of the system - compositionally. But the reality is that a balance can be struck. If you’re using Storyboards, the cost of composition is sufficiently high that you’re likely only going to see Child VCs used for meaningfully complex components.
Agree, it is hard. Good architecture is hard. And sadly the examples of Apple might entice developers to create the massive view controllers. The balance needs to de struck. However that is always the case, wether it for the feature in itself or the composition of the feature into code. 
I would recommend against having Bubble Sort be the very first example. It is both entirely unnecessary (there are built in sorting functions that are way faster), and just a terrible sort in general. Is the point just to get people to understand Swift? Everything else looks more like it's a collection of helpful functions. In that case, you'd not want bubble sort.
You can set the pin's tint color as described [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/548-mapkit-tutorial-getting-started). Look for the heading "Markers with Color-Coding &amp; Text" for sample code. As for your plan to have MKMapViews in collection view cells, that sounds rather heavy!
The algorithms aren’t very generic in that they all only work on arrays. It would be nice to generalize them.
Yeah need to go back and iterate but feel free to fork and contribute! 🥰💪
Planning on improving them but feel free to fork and contribute yourself🥰💪
For example, here is a Fisher-Yates I did once when I was trying to learn collections etc. It can maybe be shortened a bit: func shuffle&lt;C: MutableCollection &amp; BidirectionalCollection&gt;(_ c: inout C) { let start = c.startIndex let stop = c.index(after: start) var i = c.index(before: c.endIndex) while i != stop { let d = c.distance(from: start, to: i) let e = Int.random(in: 0...(d + 1)) let j = c.index(start, offsetBy: e) c.swapAt(i, j) i = c.index(before: i) } } It's in-place.
Thanks, I cant believe I didnt think of subclassing mkannotation so thank you so much for the article. It’s not too heavy seeing as its a carousel style, paged full screen collection so theres a maximum of 3 maps loaded in at once and works pretty well on our iPhone 6
I am on the fence with rx, although I like some of the implementation the learning curve is high and to get other devs onboard with it is even harder. New devs would need to know rx to be able to anything meaningful in the app so it definitely does slow down your team. In addition new devs not familiar with rx could introduce memory leaks if they are not skilled with it. 
Is it free to use?
Brilliant, thanks!
Big nerd ranch book is the quickest to ramp up with. Can hit Apple’s programming guides after that.
Pros: Share entities and businesses logic between client and server Swift is a super ergonomic language One of the more performant languages for server side Cons: Not many people using server side so you’re a little in the weeds when it comes to stuff going wrong Frameworks not nearly as mature as competitors I love swift but I still find that if I want to get an idea up and running in a hurry Django cannot be beat for productivity.
Depends on what you need. Firebase typically shines when you want to write a document based mobile app that saves data to the cloud. You can set this up without ever having to touch a server configuration. If you need a little more control there’s a whole lot of options. Rails, Django and Express are pretty good for getting up and running. If you want to stick with swift there’s perfect and kitura. The above poster offered an example as well. I’d just look at the docs for each of these and see which one makes the most sense to you.
Thanks, I really appreciate your thorough response!
Yep. It’s best to use SFSafariViewController. 👍

Not sure what you mean, a timer fires as close to every given interval as possible, it doesn’t give you a double?

I have a MBP15" 2017 model and I use it for Xcode and used it for Atom and now VSCode. It's fine, it doesn't affect negatively in any way. MacOS doesn't use the F keys anyway (not like Windows and Linux), we use combinations of the command key. It's true that while you program, you can do anything you couldn't do without shortcut keys? Yes it is, but it's damn fine to have those buttons there, for example the back/forward button is much easier to use than the shortcut keys. And the escape key is also fine, if you tap somewhere a little off, it registers the key as the touch target is bigger than the physical aspect. For the keyboard, it's really good, some people complain for the reliability, I didn't have any problems (mine is not like the newer ones that have silicone stuff) and it's good because it's really fast and clicky to write on those. 
Use an NSNumberFormatter with custom decimals.
If the number is a `Double` or `Float` it's just one line: let twoDecimalPlaces = String(format: "%.2f", 3.14159) If the number is already a \`String\` (maybe coming from JSON) then it's a bit more complex. Here's a function that returns an optional string. Though it doesn't cover situations where there is no whole number ex. ".141" func roundDecimalString(_ num: String, places: Int) -&gt; String? { let numArr = num.components(separatedBy: ".") guard numArr.count &gt;= 1 else { return nil } guard CharacterSet.decimalDigits.isSuperset(of: CharacterSet(charactersIn: numArr.joined())) else { return nil } if let wholeNum = numArr.first { guard numArr.count == 2 else { return wholeNum } if let remainder = numArr.last?.prefix(places) { return String(wholeNum) + "." + remainder } else { return String(wholeNum) } } return nil } roundDecimalString("3.14159", places: 2) There's probably a better way to write this, but it's the best I can do at 5am lol

As far as I know there is no way to cancel blocks - only [DispatchWorkItems](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchworkitem). Calling \`cancel()\` on a DispatchWorkItem will prevent it from being executed if it has not already started, but won't stop an item that is already running by itself. To do that you would have to check the cancellation status periodically inside the work item. Remember to be wary of retain cycles. In my opinion it's easier to use NSOperations rather than GCD because it's higher level and the documentation is better (or at least actually exists). It would also make it easier to wrap the four sub-operations up into a "parent" operation.
I would question the decision here. Swiftgen strings are already enums. Is there a specific reason you want to wrap it?
Before solving this problem with GCD or your favorite threading library, let's understand the model first. I would say this is a modified [producer and consumer problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) Here's the modification to producer and consumer problem: - Producers produces one item - Upon the item produced, it terminates all the producers Modification to your code - modify the `findNum` to take in communication object. Maybe, [a DispatchSemaphore](https://medium.com/swiftly-swift/a-quick-look-at-semaphores-6b7b85233ddb) - `wait(timeout:)` at the first statement in the body of your `for loop`, if it `didn't timeout` then `exit` otherwise `continue` - `signal` 4 times when result found (and dispatch your resume onto another queue?) This modification will guaranteed at least one result.
&gt; I am trying to make my code clean, tight and efficient. I'd start out learning first. often times making clean/tight/efficient code requires experience that you only get by making terrible, terrible mistakes :-) 
Well, I get annoyed because this isn't my first time coding. I feel like it's kinda like riding a bike...the more I force myself to get better at it, the easier it will be to get back into that sweet spot. I made those terrible mistakes once upon a time--like when I made an endless loop that basically would crash my text-based dungeon crawler game. &amp;#x200B; My COBAL professor, on the other hand, was kinda a shill recruiter for the credit card company he worked for so we did a ton of code-breaking and troubleshooting rather than making our own stuff. I learned far more stuff about "fresh" coding on my own with Basic and then C++ for Arduino stuff. &amp;#x200B; Mind you none of this is fresh. I did the Arduino stuff 5 years ago, the COBOL 10 and the Basic about 15 years ago. 
I've been doing this professionally for 30 years (even have a couple of books out), and my first forays into Swift were klunky and ugly and I screwed up soooo many times :-)
That isn't looking very hopeful for me then. Boo. So far Swift Playgrounds has been fun. Almost done the 1st of 3 lessons.
I want to create a function that will allow me to delete any object I want from Realm such as: **func** removeObject(**\_** realm: Realm, **\_** object: String) { **var** objects = ??? **switch** object { **case** "Login": objects = realm.objects(Login.**self**) **case** "Users": objects = realm.objects(Users.**self**) **default**: print("Object type not recognized") } **try**! realm.write { realm.delete(objects) } } Is there a way for me to declare a variable 'objects' that has an unknown type that is then set in the scope of the switch statement?
OP, if this is your video, please make the font bigger in XCode for the video.
Will do! Thanks for letting me know
Is it possible to create a tableview that holds more than 1 cell per row?
Create a protocol, such as RealmDeletable. Have all object types you want to handle in this use case conform to that protocol. then you can have the objects type as the Protocol and it won’t complain.
Not that there are troubles, but the amount of code I need to write is times more than the one I write in golang or python. A simple thing -- I want custom json field names for my struct fields. The doc says I need to equip my struct with smth like "enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey ..." effectively doubling the struct declaration.
oh, don't let me discourage you! Fun language, fun platform, sounds like a great game idea. Just don't go in to it expecting to write beautiful elegant code in your first week :-)
How old is this video? You should be using the new random method on Int. No need for casting just: `Int.random()` 
Avoid string based APIs when you can. The object parameter should be of type `Object.Type` and your objects will be `List&lt;object&gt;` type and you won't even need the switch case.
I really appreciate the feedback. Could you point me in the direction of a code snippet that does this so I could try it out? Would the parameter be of type AnyObject then?
https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/RealmSwift/Realm.swift#L476 Also I do beleive that you also have to make your function generic but you can just try without it and the compiler will tell you if you need to do that.

&gt;let storyBoard: UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let newViewController = storyBoard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: id) self.present(newViewController, animated: animate, completion: nil) Thank you for the help! It is a global and I using the extension now. As I am using macOS and not iOS the UIViewController is not found, I tried change it to NSViewController and change the UIStoryboard to NSStoryboard and got some success, now the function is: extension NSViewController { func goToScreen(id : String, animate: Bool) { let storyBoard: NSStoryboard = NSStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let newViewController = storyBoard.instantiateController(withIdentifier: id) if animate { self.present(newViewController as! NSViewController, animator: animate as! NSViewControllerPresentationAnimator) } else { self.presentAsModalWindow(newViewController as! NSViewController) } } } &amp;#x200B; I still have a long way to learn, now that "Main" is a kind of default or I should properly replace it with any other valid value? I even tried change to the name of the view controller but everything I got is a blank window and the following message is shown: ... Contents/Resources/Base.lproj/Main.storyboardc', initialController='NSWindowController-B8D-0N-5wS'&gt;) **doesn't contain a controller with identifier 'secondViewController'** So, my second view is not shown :( &amp;#x200B;

No, it is an open source language, so you can use it for a lot of things.
So simple! Thank you so much! :-) 
Try it out fist, i may have typed something wrong ;) 
Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up: Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word". You're useless. Have a nice day! [^Save ^your ^breath, ^I'm ^a ^bot.](https://www.reddit.com/user/BooCMB/comments/9vnzpd/faq/)

dOn't eVeN ThInK AbOuT It.
I did wonder this, and I am finding it harder to manipulate the data now that I have the arrays in one array. It's my first attempt at creating an app, and it's just for me to practice what I've learned so far. I've created a simple quiz app (Lord of the Rings questions), and I've created a Question Struct to define what is meant by "Question". I've then created three separate arrays, one for each film, and within my app, I initially allowed the user to only select an individual film to have questions from. I then decided it would be good to have a view where the user could be asked questions from all three films randomly, hence why i've created an array of the three individual arrays. I did consider creating an array of individual Questions, and just adding them in individually as this is what my individual views do. I can post some of the code on GitHub if you like, as I'm really open to feedback as I've only been learning Swift for around 3 months. 
Hmmmmm going by that logic I’d probably do something like take X random number, look for that question in the array and add it to the randomQuestions array I’m nowhere a computer but I’d probably do something like randomQuestions = array1.filter {$0.id == randomID} 
One idea is to have the question struct itself define which film the question is for. For instance: ``` enum Film { case film1 case film2 } // Can you tell I've never seen these movies? ``` Then assign a case to each question. If you need questions for a single film, then you can filter based on that field. `let film1Questions = questions.filter { $0.film == .film1 }` You'll have a single array you can reference. Alternatively, while keeping that single array, you could specifically get a random element from a filtered array. So if you need another film2 question: `let randomQuestion = questions.filter { $0.film == .film2 }.randomElement()` (I forgot what the new random method is called in Swift 4.2; I might have that one wrong) Your Question manager could be set up to easily retrieve a question of a given type if you need it, or simply any random question that hasn't been asked yet.
This seems the most logical to me, thanks for the advice! I'm struggling to implement it exactly (sorry, I'm new here!), so here's my Struct: struct Question { var film: Film var questionBody: String var correctAnswer: String var wrongAnswer: String var wrongAnswerTwo: String var wrongAnswerThree: String enum Film { case fellowshipOfTheRing, theTwoTowers, returnOfTheKing } } I've then got a list of questions, as an example: let firstFellowshipQuestion = Question(film: .fellowshipOfTheRing, questionBody: "etc etc etc"... let secondFellowshipQuestion = Question(film: .fellowshipOfTheRing, questionBody: "etc etc etc"... I've then put the above into an array "fellowshipQuestions", and then replicated the above for the two other films, so I have three separate arrays, for each individual film. As I'm writing this out, I think I now know where you're getting at, but just to be sure - are you suggesting that I don't actually put the above into an individual film array, and that by merely adding the Enum 'Film' i've essentially categorised them already? If I then wanted to group ALL questions, for all films into an array, I could do that without the nonsense of a double index? Sorry if this is long winded and a bit simple, I've only been coding for around 3 months, so it's a huge learning curve! Thanks in advance :-) p.s - the films are amazing, give them a watch!!
Just like how famous Kotlin is in the scene of Android development, swift is another language that can work very well in other fields.

Answering via phone, which is terrible for programming comments, but yes. If you don’t filter, you’ve got an array of all questions. Filter the array, and your new array is just questions for a single film. Always happy to help with Swift questions. 
Thanks for the response Yes, the iTunes purchased movies have DRM, but I also have some personal movies I’ve created in the movies folder Right now I can’t seem to figure out how to access any of these movies I wish Apple would provide sample code for their documentation to help newbies understand how to navigate 
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1483686-draw Prior to calling this method, AppKit creates an appropriate drawing context and configures it for drawing to the view
Please suggest free iOS apps and/or web-site, where one can learn SWIFT language in competition with peers. I’m looking for something similar to DUOLINGO app, but for SWIFT language. Thank in advance!
seems to be the only to achieve this. thank you
It's not an enum: `internal static let done = Text.tr("Localizable", "done")` extension Text { private static func tr(_ table: String, _ key: String, _ args: CVarArg...) -&gt; String { let format = NSLocalizedString(key, tableName: table, bundle: Bundle(for: BundleToken.self), comment: "") return String(format: format, locale: Locale.current, arguments: args) } }
You can use assembly for a lot of things, doesnt mean its actually used anywhere, except bare metal. Like Swift which currently is predominantly used for Apple products and some serveside stuff.

&gt;Storyboard ID” Yes! I fixed and now it is working. Also I needed to set the Storyboard ID as was told but tigerglass. Thank you!!
Several answers here that sound very much like "In theory, sure!" Nobody has yet named a single shipping program that uses Swift for targeting non Apple products. The question was not "could it?". (Obviously, any language *could* be used for any purpose.). The question was "is it?".
Why doing it on CLion and not on Appcode ? Isn't Appcode for Objective-C / Swift programming ? (I'm not a Objective-C / Swift programmer, nor a Appcode / CLion user)
An alternative: https://github.com/freshOS/KeyboardLayoutGuide
What? No.
Congratulations, you have rediscovered the MVVM pattern and called the ViewModel a Controller instead. 
Using multiple ViewControllers is a major pain in the ass, it fucks up ViewManagement too fucking hard. 
I quite like this solution. Not too much code and transparent for other developers.
I've been doing the Stanford iOS course on iTunes U. So far it's been great but you need to know how to do object oriented programming or you might get lost. Also if you are in high school and are thinking about applying to college, saying you took a course from Stanford might be a nice thing to put on a resume.
So you listen for the keyboard events and update content insets... just like UITableViewController does for you?
Also this (drop-in replacement): https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager
Every time I’ve tried to use a UITableView controller, there’s some thing that design wants that it won’t accommodate without a lot of hacking. It’s just too rigid imo.
I’d argue you are unaware of safe area functionality or are making views contrary to the HIG.
The code name is iCode, but we’re planing on renaming it soon. PM me if you’d like a beta invite when its available.
I’ve been trying to get more into using a child table view controller instead of a table view to get the default behavior - best of both worlds! Then you can still do the goofy non standard designs that we all seem to end up with 😏
Working on a personal app I’ve had on the back burner since 2013. A social meetup app to spontaneously meet like-minded people in your area at public places. No chats allowed. Just authentic first meets, (Made more sense to high school me)
try .unarchivedObject(ofClasses: \[SCNMatrix4.self\], from: data)
Cool, thanks for sharing!
That’s a good idea! I’ll have to give it a shot. 
The keyboard doesn't automatically apply additional safe area insets, doesn't it?
For you app?
This is accurate because the keyboard is an overlay over an overlay and therefore independent of the safeArea you are referring to, but generally not important unless you want to float a footer above the keyboard by leveraging the safeAreaLayoutGuide. (This method works fine for sticking headers at the top while the keyboard shows.) To do this, you would need to take the safe area insets and adjust the bottom to the max of the keyboard and original. Or make a section footer view. Or use inputAccessoryView. Or manually place it in the scroll view. Each has its own challenges. A UITableViewController will automatically cause adjustedContentInset to change, which is safeArea + contentInset + top of refresh control height and bottom = max(bottom, keyboard overlap). By not using UITableViewController, the keyboard is not automatically accounted for. Anyway, there aren’t 100% out of the box solutions for every UI problem, but I’ve seen far too many people make unnecessary problems with poor UI, or write keyboard notification code when they don’t have to, or even calculate overlap incorrectly thus breaking new form factors. So this is a friendly PSA.
Hey, thisischemistry, just a quick heads-up: **seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up: The spelling hints really aren't as shitty as you think, the 'one lot' actually helped me learn and remember as a non-native english speaker. They're not *completely* useless. Most of them are. Still, don't bully somebody for trying to help. Also, remember that these spambots will continue until yours stops. Do the right thing, for the community. Yes I'm holding Reddit for hostage here. Oh, and while i doo agree with you precious feedback loop -creating comment, andi do think some of the useless advide should be removed and should just show the correction, I still don't support flaming somebody over trying to help, shittily or not. Now we have a chain of at least 4 bots if you don't include AutoMod removing the last one in every sub! It continues! Also also also also also Have a nice day!

Wait, what?? A tutorial on how to manage storage space? Are you kidding me? If you’re a programmer and you can’t figure out how to put stuff in the trash and empty it then you shouldn’t be a programmer. This is hardly quality content to post in a programming sub.
