I know. Like I said you have to enter it into the info.plist for the app. It's required by Apple so there's no way around it.
Thanks! I have added it in the app, which uses framework. Still not working... I think an issue is much harder to solve... :(
Background fetch has an algorithm that decides when to retrieve informaton while in the background. You're never going to get a constant stream of background data as Apple just doesn't allow it.
so no way to start uploading a photo, going to background and continue it? I am uploading base64.. this is indeed a problem..
where too would I change this?
Nope no way at all. Android lets you get away with that, but not iOS. The fetch algorithm is as far as people can tell completely random and not reliable.
&gt; There's no code So what makes you think it could be a Swift issue.if you haven't written any relevant Swift code? And then posted your question in r/swift
But that’s why I asked in the title whether or not it was relevant and assumed most people use Xcode with swift 
Try a sub where they have specific iOS programming expertise like /r/iOSProgramming

I mean, it’s a super simple google, “apple URLSessionConfiguration”
I did that, and I get an exception, because I need to implement it in appdelegate. How can I do that in a framework?
Thank you for this example and linking quicktype. This helped me get rid of SwiftyJson entirely. &amp;#x200B; Question - are there any reasons to be using Swiftyjson over Codable? Most of the examples I saw online used Swiftyjson so I just ran with it not knowing that there was a native option.
You don’t have to do anything in app delegate ??? In fact you should rarely ever do anything in app delegate ...
With your Struct example, can you overload the ~= operator to be able to pattern match on different aspects? You have the one being able to pattern match on the Age, could you make another that would let you pattern match on the name?
Provide a method that handles the completion, and then instructions for any consumer of your framework to call that method from their app delegate's application(\_:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:) method.
Yeah, nothing stops you from creating as many overloads as you want.
As the other comment suggests, a standard way is to provide a functions that match the functions you need from the app delegate and then document clearly the installation and setup steps for consumers of your framework... e.g. call that function from your app delegate. But some of the more popular frameworks rely on swizzling. They only need a single initialisation point usually named similar to and called within applicationDidFinishLaunching. This framework function then takes the original instances of the functions from the AppDelegate and replaces them with the frameworks own versions making sure to call back to the originals when finished. Swizzling is dangerous and easily conflicts with other frameworks. I like Urban Airships approach where they offer a way to turn this off so that the dev can hook up the functions manually.
I **must define handlers** in appdelegate.. have you read the documentation? [https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/b3hfua/how\_to\_create\_background\_network\_tasks\_in\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/b3hfua/how_to_create_background_network_tasks_in_a/)
Thanks for clear explanation.. I however did not get this part "**provide a functions that match the functions you need from the app delegate "** I just can't simply provide completion handlers in a regular method, **or can I**? I must do it in appDelegate specifically...
This is what we do in our networking framework! Can’t think of any other way around it.
Sorry I completely missed the question 😅 As the error is suggesting you need to use the delegates of your network session. See this doc for how a download session works: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsessiondownloadtask And this is the delegate you’ll need to implement: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsessiondownloaddelegate?language=objc
As /u/ThePowerOfStories mentioned you must handle the callback in the AppDelegate, but you can just call another function on any of your own classes to do the work (including calling the completionHandler)
Can you post a screenshot/gif? I wonder if it's related to not drawing on exact pixels. Since it's eventually mapped to the screen, anything other than full pixel positioning will cause some blur (or maybe jittering on spritekit jumping between pixels?). That's how it is with Core Animation anyway.
There's tons of them out there. This type of question has been asked dozens of times here, just search the sub and see the answers already provided. 
Hmm, I still did not get an idea , how that would look like :( Sad, seems like I am still a beginner in some parts of coding :(
Any cons? I'm torn between .NET Core and Spring Boot cause I'm more experienced in Java but really like C#. I'm planning to build a simple Web API for my backend
Ray Wenderlich, Big Nerd Ranch, Brian Voong on youtube, hacking with swift.
`Codable` is relatively new, for a while Swift had poor support for JSON so a few outside frameworks popped up and people wrote guides for them. Then `Codable` was added and some people switched over to it while others kept SwiftyJson. I'm not too versed in SwiftyJson, I know it uses `Dictionary` to represent an object rather than a defined type. This makes it a bit more quick to use at first but it can be a pain because you end up casting all over the place. `Codable` is very safe since it's backed by a concrete model and it's pretty simple to use with a tool like quicktype.
If you're goal is to download something every day / week / month in background even if user doesn't use app, that's impossible on iOS. You can only control the minimum time between fetch, but cannot force it to happen on exact time. After about 10mins the OS will kill it to save memory. The app needs to be in the foreground to keep it alive.
I read this could not be done. Looks like that info was wrong. A work around was to request telephoney feature and that would select only iPhones. Thanks, this looks a lot better solution.
In Interface builder, click one time on your label to highlight it. Then (there are multiple ways to to this, but this is the easiest way to type out to you) go to the View menu down to Inspectors and then Show Size Inspector. The inspector pane should appear on the right hand side and the constraints will be in the bottom half. &amp;#x200B; Rule of thumb with constraints, use as few as possible to get your app to work. Adding extra constraints usually ends with crying.
Late binding is indeed a big productivity win, and has been a core tenet of object-oriented programming since Alan Kay coined the phrase. Despite all of Apple's posturing, I have yet to see any study that finds early binding to improve productivity *or* increase reliability.
I'd start with Apple's books, [Intro to App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11) and [App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11).
How? All you get is a physical type, like `ClosedRange&lt;Int&gt;` or `String`, so they all have to live in the same namespace. How would you create overloads for `firstName` and `secondName` here?
Honest question, how does Swift compare to something like Golang as far as speed? I would guess Swift is not as fast but maybe faster than something like JAVA. 
Thank you so much, I looked through the preview and it looked very good, plus now I have something to read on the bus! Your suggestion is very much appreciated 
provide a function*
Have you read the thread you linked to? They gave you the answer: "instructions for any consumer of your framework to call that method from their app delegate", and "Can’t think of any other way around it". Why do you think that asking the same question again is going to change the answer?
Create a singleton class that is a manager for the process. Back in the Objective-C world, in that manager I'd listen for any methods that you'd need that normally are only intercepted by the appDelegate.
Is there a reason why you wouldn't use GDC to dispatch a request on a queue that's not the main queue? Or even a GDC dispatch queue.
Seconding the Ray Wenderlich recommendation, and also wanted to let you know that Udemy is having a sale right now ($12.99 on all classes until 11:59 pm PST, 3/20). I've found their React and Kotlin courses pretty useful, though I can't speak to their Swift courses. 
This is Vapor 2 years ago (I know not pure swift, but its compared to pure Go) https://medium.com/@codevapor/server-side-swift-vs-the-other-guys-2-speed-ca65b2f79505 This is Vapor last year, compared to GIN, https://medium.com/@codevapor/vapor-3-0-0-released-8356fa619a5d Here is swift versus go nightly, https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/swift-go.html THis provides probably the most real word comprehensive comparison, which does not include CDN's or cache layers at networks, but response time for routing, https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks Allthat said, Im not sure how much of this (besides Vapor) uses Swift NIO, let alone Swift NIO 2. Ill be very interested to see how this all changes with Swift Nio 2 and Swift 5. For now I only know Swift, Obj-C, and PHP as an expert so Ill stick to swift for the time being.
Why no comparison to Objective-C?
Because that can’t be compiled for a server?
How are we to guess what is going on if you don't post the code that is causing this?
This is a question for people with web experience as well. I have worked in swift since it came out and some objc before that. I want to make an app for the web but the shear number of framework/library options is overwhelming. Can someone recommend what might be the easiest transition for a swift iOS developer? I’d use firebase for my real-time backend since I’ve used it before. I’ve tried tutorials in angular, react and vue and for the basics none seem particularly close but maybe I haven’t gone far enough down one path. Any recommendations from someone experienced with iOS and web?
it’s the code in the tutorial i linked let provider = FUIEmailAuth... 
So, start. Start by searching for them.
no. I need to upload just one photo, then person takes picture in ViewController. I don't need to fetch some data periodically
it will be still killed if you go to the background immediately
Hmmmm that second link smells like an attack vector to me...
And your assumption would be that you typed it in 100% correctly, which is never a good assumption to make. If you show the code *you* have, we might be able to help your by pointing out something you may have missed. 
 // Create default Auth UI let authUI = FUIAuth.defaultAuthUI() // Check that it isn't nil guard authUI != nil else { return } // Set delegate and specify sign in options authUI?.delegate = self authUI?.providers = [FUIEmailAuth()] // Get the auth view controller and present it let authViewController = authUI!.authViewController() present(authViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
i imported firebaseUI
Great info. Thanks!
You're going to want to change: authUI?.providers = [FUIEmailAuth()] To: authUI?.providers = [FUIEmailAuth]()
Maybe use 2-3 nodes and when one goes completely off-screen put it on the other side?
They do stuff in app delegate as an example, you can do it anywhere you like, for me I would create a new URLSessionConfiguration for my uploading process called like backroundUploader, you have to make a new URLSession with this configuration.
Watch this video tutorial. This should answer any questions you have and give you a fully functional log in screen. Worked perfect for me. https://youtu.be/GBiBXEHKYzY
I'm making a collection of my code test/challenge projects during the job interviews in a repo. Due to I'm the Rx fans so every project is solving a tiny things with RxSwift includes: Basic API call, URLSession with Rx JSON Parsing both Codable and SwiftyJSON Navigation MVVM Storyboard DI Weather App [https://github.com/boska/rx-n](https://github.com/boska/rx-n) Any suggest welcome!
&gt;Fighting with a random provisioning profile error that popped up a few days ago. I facing this too, and I solved with a macOS update
Perhaps you can make a blog about it with screenshots. As far as I know, there is no watch extension scheme.
Unfortunately, enabling target membership for all the files under the watch extension folder doesn't work. Have you tried this yourself?
Check out parse server. Built on Nodejs. Handles authentication, storage, push, etc, I’ve exclusively used parse for a while now but I’m actually thinking about trying Firebase for my next project. What are some of your issues with Firebase? You might save me from wasting my time.
Would this help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39562862/how-to-check-if-dark-appearance-is-enabled-tvos
you can't overload for every field, you are overloading for a type. struct User { let firstName: String let secondName: String let age: Int } extension User { static func ~= (range: ClosedRange&lt;Int&gt;, user: User) -&gt; Bool { return range.contains(user.age) } static func ~= (name: String, user: User) -&gt; Bool { return user.firstName.contains(name) } }
It does not work in regular class. I am getting an exception.. Can you provide an example? Please
here is some super simple code... let config = URLSessionConfiguration.background(withIdentifier: "test") let session = URLSession(configuration: config) let upload = session.uploadTask(with: URLRequest(), from: Data()) { (data, response, error) in // Completion } 
Oh thanks!! I thought I need to create URLSession with delegate in constructor. And I tried to do that with conforming to delegate in the class and I got issues with that... Thanks again!
If you're not really concerned about unexpected bills, vendor lock-in or having no server-side customisation then there's no real issues with firebase, although I started this project using Parse, there was too many unfixable bugs that the community couldn't provide a good solution for and in the end the whole project couldn't go forward using parse. Tbh from what I've done as far as research now, GraphQL or Vapor as a backend for your app is actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it and it's fairly cheap to run (Heroku or GCE/AWS) but if you're just looking for something that's ready to go out-of-the-box and not planning on leaving firebase in the future of the app then Firebase is great.
Yes there are some cons that I could mention. Firstly, the ecosystem is hard to understand at first, since .NET Framework and .NET Core are done on top of .NET Standard, and it does confuse some people in the beginning. Second, the language does have some weird (in my opinion) guidelines on how the code should be written (methods start with a capital letter etc.) which is something that people don't like. Third, Razor pages are something that I don't like about ASP.NET. other than that, I can't think of other cons, but if you have a specific question, feel free to ask 😊. Oh, and I've heard good things about Spring Boot as well, so the choice has to be made based on your needs and your preference. Java and C# are not so different in syntax, but the ecosystem is different, that's why I would suggest you try both, and then decide. 
What’s the developer job market like in Florida? I’m strongly considering moving out of Canada to the US for work. Right now I’m mostly looking at San Jose, Seattle and Austin.
Floridian here. Most of the higher-paying jobs are not in Florida. Florida is a hub for the defense industry, but if you're moving out of Canada, it will be a lot harder to get a clearance to work in those places. Apart from defense, we also have a growing simulation industry (e.g.: Magic Leap is located in Orlando, Florida). I will be moving to Seattle to pursue software engineering positions, but I know a good amount of people staying for the defense companies/simulation companies/small startups.
What exactly is not working? If you import WatchKit in your code, that import will of course not work for iOS Test Cases. Also you don't have to import your App Target then with with enabled target membership, because the code is already part of the test target. I have previously shared code between iOS and WatchOS targets and it worked perfectly fine. 
It is harder to move in and out of Rx code than wrap your network calls in Rx. It lets you drive you UI the same way no matter if it is a network call, local storage, or an user input. I do agree Rx can be overkill, but not if you are already using it. 
Aha. Thank you.
I've never done a blog before but i'll try my best! 
I can't keep up with Swift strings &gt; no source-code changes from developers should be necessary* Okay, whew. Swift will eventually surely end up having the most thoroughly-considered String implementation of any programming language. But it has been an annual bloodbath trying to stay up-to-date with their changing considerations.
It's cute how far they are willing to bend over backwards to try to convince themselves that using UTF-16 was *ever* a good decision. UTF-8 was developed in 1992, and was the standard system encoding for Plan 9 in ... 1992. All the advantages they cite for UTF-8 were well known. It was always self-synchronizing and validating, because that's how it was designed. It always had better memory density, and memory was much more scarce back then. This isn't some new technology they just discovered. It's the same age as Windows 3.1. Welcome to the future.
&gt; Swift will eventually surely end up having the most thoroughly-considered String implementation of any programming language. It looks like Apple ended up with something that looks rather like Perl strings -- having first exhausted every other possibility.
Right, which doesn't sound like what s73v3r was asking. "Be able to pattern match on different aspects, as long as they all have different physical types" is quite different from "be able to pattern match on different aspects".
&gt; Florida, the state of oranges and sunshine, is the southernmost state of the US The first half of the first sentence isn't even factually correct.
It's possible it could lead to a security hole due to acting in a completely unintuitive manner, compared to what the programmer intended, but in order to exploit it, you'd need the program to have been written in a very specific way (ExpressibleByStringLiteral, switch, operator `~=`), and you'd need specific knowledge of how it was written. It's exceptionally unlikely you'd ever be able to send a request to a Swift HTTP server and be able to bypass any access controls because of this.
I mean who’d have guessed that trying to codify written language across all the earth would take more than a day or two tops? I mean it’s gotta be easy like date and time zones, right?
Followed the steps and its now working. Thanks.
If only they had some experience using UTF-8 in some other programming language that they didn't have to spend 5 years rewriting its implementation over and over again.
Yea I didn’t have luck either. Seems like an issue with the free certs. Hopefully Apple fixes it soon.
Easy there sailor. 
Swift's original String implementation was a shim over NSString, which does date back to an era where UTF8 was… well, not *as* obvious a choice anyway, I won't say it wasn't a good choice even then. Certainly UTF-16 was a choice that made sense to a wide variety of people, considering Java, Javascript, Windows, and NeXT all picked it. Java only caught up even to where NSString is (UTF16 w/ alternate backing store for strings with all ASCII-compatible contents) in Java 9!
If you just want to use max priority equality constraints then you need 2 vertical and 2 horizontal constraints to define, minX, width, minY, height. Or you can omit one if you want the size to be based on the intrinsic content size. &amp;#x200B; There can be more magic done by playing with priority and using unequality and content hugging priority and compression resistance. Those will come with practice and facing/solving problems where just using the basics is not enough.
FoundationKit (including [NSString](http://www.gnustep.org/resources/OpenStepSpec/FoundationKit/Classes/NSString.html)) was first released to the public in 1994. UTF-8 was created in 1992 (with support for 6-byte forms = 2 billion codepoints), and UTF-16 not until 1996. These systems you list all picked UCS-2, not UTF-16, since their Unicode support all predate UTF-16 by a few years. We all knew that wouldn't last. UTF-16 was always a hack on UCS-2 to extend it. Designing a system around UCS-2 in the 1990's is like using 32-bit `time_t` today. It will work for a while, but everyone who knows the state of the art knows it won't last long. "A wide variety of people" means how many people, exactly? I wouldn't be surprised if the total number of people involved in all these Unicode design decisions was less than 10 -- or if most of them picked it for compatibility with the others.
I’ve done something like this and what I did was: - Tableview - tableview cell - Collectionview - collectionview cell - UIImage 
Just download Angela Yu’s iOS development class on Udemy. Mark my words, soon I might know what the hell you guys are talking about. 
Heh, that's what I get for oversimplifying. Yes, UCS-2, not UTF-16, I just don't expect most people to recognize the former these days ;) "couldn't last long" is such a tricky thing with API compatibility guarantees. With the benefit of hindsight, 10.0 (or public beta) would have been a good time to make the breaking change, but I'm sure they had their hands full. I feel like I asked Ali once about why they chose UCS-2, but it's been such a long time that I don't remember what he said. Ah well, at least things are getting better now. 
UTF-16 made perfect sense before unicode expanded beyond 16-bits. 
Could be worse. C++ still doesn't support UTF-8 or 16 or 32. 
I'm surprised they didn't go with UTF-32. While it would consume more memory, it supports faster access to arbitrary offsets and easier string manipulations. Maybe combining character and modifier support made arbitrary access less helpful. 
Gotta leave something for Swift 6.1.
 i just started learning swift and am following this tutorial ([https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/BuildABasicUI.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/BuildABasicUI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1)) but the editor it tells me to use does not show up.

i've been using xcode for a long time and never noticed that button i've been pressing Shift+Command+L all this time
Will do. Starting on it next week. 
&gt; I feel like I asked Ali once about why they chose UCS-2, but it's been such a long time that I don't remember what he said. Could have been [worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_character_set)!
The clue is literally there, I don’t think you will be able to present a view after but you can mark as complete and display a new screen when coming back easily enough
The earliest ISO 10646 spec defined 31 bits worth of space, and UCS-4 as the native transformation format. (UCS-2 was for the BMP.) This wasn't officially cut down until 2003, when RFC 3629 (updated UTF-8) was written. And of course UTF-8 itself was originally designed to support code points up to 31 bits, too. All of this was well before Unicode 2.0 and UTF-16 and any codepoints beyond 2^16 were actually allocated. There's a big difference between "we don't happen to use values greater than X yet" and "this system doesn't support values greater than X". Saying UTF-16 made sense before any codepoints greater than 2^16-1 were allocated is like saying 32-bit `time_t` makes sense as long as it's not 19 January 2038 yet.
That’s not necessarily the case due to Unicode allowing multiple codepoints to represent a single character.
It would consume a *lot* more memory, to the point where many optimizations (like smol strings) would be infeasible. You'd get only 3 characters on 64-bit, rather than 15, which makes them essentially useless. And using 4x as much memory tends to make everything slower, since you're constantly blowing out your cache, and using indirection to get to all the data (mostly 0's) that can't fit in any registers. As you say, the way Unicode is designed, there really isn't a great use case for random access. That's a remnant of how C stored English-character strings as byte arrays, and in the modern world, pretending everything is a byte array will result in a program that's somewhere between "inefficient" and "wrong".
Your question doesn't quite make sense. [UITableView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableview) and [UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionview) are different but similar ways to show scrolling lists of cells. If you're trying to have a table view with collection views inside each cell then I don't recommend that as embedding a scroll view inside another scroll view causes bad things to happen for the user. Can you re-phrase your question?
What if I use a library where I'm generally aware how it works (perhaps enforced by using a decompiler) and then create a `~=` override designed to manipulate that library's switch statements etc? Or the other way around, if I write a library which behaves as expected for debug builds, but which introduces subtly malicious custom `~=` operators based on expectations I've made by my API design?
hi, marxy. Sorry if i did not explain in the best possible way. What i really want is, to do a page like the first page of the app netflix. Where i think we have a table view with different collection views in there. My question is how i can do something similar like this link [exemple](https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/68/68/63637872373728/0/5-best-apps-for-streaming-movies-your-phone.w1456.jpg). I did manage do do the first one with the larger image but then i struggle to make the others one. The way im trying to achieve this is with a table view and differences collections views PS: i already did all the back-end code, i really need now to make the UI.
Yeah it changed in swift 4 I believe 
That it is interesting, I would like to take a look at that. Can you post a small sandbox project that shows that issue? You can reply here or PM me, whatever you are comfortable with, NP.
Is this what you mean? [https://www.raywenderlich.com/221-recreating-the-apple-music-now-playing-transition](https://www.raywenderlich.com/221-recreating-the-apple-music-now-playing-transition)
You can't add variables through an extension, you'll get an error like "Extensions must not contain stored properties". You'll need to subclass UITableView. 
OK well that's a UIPageViewController embedded in a UITableViewCell.
People learn differently. Some like to read documentation and books, others learn better by working through examples. &amp;#x200B; I'd suggest finding example projects to learn from. Or work through some of the examples on [https://www.raywenderlich.com/](https://www.raywenderlich.com/).
Just start my blog on [https://truongnn.me/](https://truongnn.me/) Feel free to give me some feedback
There are other solutions which provide close-to-constant-time random access to parts of your string without requiring you to use 4x the memory in most cases.
You have not initialised your keyboard class from a nib, but you have outlets...
The keyboard UIView is part of the storyboard.
So you need to move it to a nib then as your are instantiating your keyboard UIView as a class without any view reference, so you need to move that keyboard view to a nib and instantiate it as a nib
As I am relatively new to Xcode that’ll take me a while to figure out, but thanks for the help!
It’s easy, make a new view file from file &gt; new, cut and paste the view from your storyboard, subclass that view to your view via the 3 rd tab in the right panel, top box, probably says NSObjext it in currently, then re-connect your outlets to keyboard class, then change the keyboard =Keyboard() toninitalise from nib
Yeah, looks like that’s what’s asked of you. 
First off, you shouldn't be having a view controller as a property in a custom view; it's not even being used. Second, it's customary to append to the end of the class name what it's subclassing, so I would go with `KeyboardView`. Third, if you have views in the storyboard, then they should have outlets in the view controller. If you have a `Keyboard` view in the `MainViewController` storyboard, you should have an outlet in `MainViewController` connecting the `Keyboard` view. I say this since in one of the comments you said the view is added to the storyboard. Fourth, are the `UIButton` outlets connected to `Keyboard`? The error happens because you are using an implicit declaration with `!`. There is nothing connected so the array is nil.
Xcode 10 I thought.
bottom right*
The more tutorials you do, the better you get. A lot of people still complain about constraints but I find them incredibly easy once you know how to use them all around. I rarely have issues with them.
We can't help you without any code.
I am creating a custom keyboard in order to integrate gesture recognizers, and so I have a large amount of code containing IBActions for each of the buttons and an array of UIButton outlets to modify all of the buttons at once. Because of this, I wanted to segregate the keyboard code from my ViewController code. However, since you are saying that I should keep storyboard outlets in the ViewController, perhaps using a NIB is the best option. I just hope I don’t run into any trouble when I try to animate the NIB overtop of the storyboard view. 
OK, you tell us the error but not the part of the error that tells you what is causing it. Which property was unwrapped that caused the crash? You didn't supply that, but you know that the use of the ! explicitly means that your app *will* crash when it is unwrapped and a nil value is found. So, this means that letterKeys is nil. Don't forget to hook up your IBOutlets to their proper view in a storyboard or XIB. 
it still does not work. I have removed all success or failure closures from the requests and still getting same exception
It's a really solid course...I've been building websites for years but had zero experience with Swift/iOS. I plowed through Angela's course and did all the Swift Playgrounds on iPad. I honestly feel like I can build pretty much anything now. 
Which part didn’t work ?
I am getting same exception. I have found an article which demonstrates same case. Is this code correct?
Awesome - thanks for sharing. Will have a look at it
I've used this approach in Flutter and it was nice, but on Swift, without hot reload and decent code completion it may be a bit of a nightmare.
I’m not sure if your trolling or not but if you’ve just nil’d the completions then obviously it will crash, it’s telling you to use upload task with delegate...
The keyboard code should stay in the keyboard class. The view controller shouldn’t be responsible for how a custom view operates or behaves.
By default I think it will use an iPhone 8 size for Xcode playground. You can change the Playground Live View size by changing the preferredContentSize of the view controller before setting it as live view. // Present the view controller in the Live View window let vc = MyViewController() vc.preferredContentSize = CGSize(width: 350, height: 350) PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = vc 
Surely strings are a solvable problem, unlike those other two abominations you mentioned.
IIRC it's not that the separator is actually bolder, but that the left inset of the separator is revealing a slither of the view behind it, probably the table view itself. Have you tried changing the table view's background colour?
Out of interest. Why are your coordinators hardcoded to only support 1 vc, I personally use coordinator for more of a flow/feature coordinator? If your coordinator is hardcoded to 1 VC, what benefits does it have over just using a VC ?
Thank you very much! :)
Great point, hot reload and code completion improvements is on our roadmap. Great thing about declarative approaches is that hot reload can be implemented much more cleanly, where a lot of the components are stateless, and even stateful components can be easily managed after the reload. As compared to entangled inherently stateful view controllers, which can hold references to each other.
Not sure what you can do. It's more a problem of iOS ecosystem. But good luck.
[Debug your view hierarchy](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/ExaminingtheViewHierarchy.html), maybe that will point you in the right direction.
Oh, iOS doesn't get in the way much, there's a lot of stuff possible with dynamically reloading frameworks and a few other approaches. It's just that Apple haven't given much attention to it, but it's definitely possible and I think it's doable and will be well worth the effort we put in the implementation of it.
Well done. I landed on something similar when I implemented tabs. 
They aren’t. Unless I’m misunderstanding, the tabbed coordinator here just holds a tabbarcontroller instead of a navigation controller. 
If you look at the coordinator base class it holds an instance of UIViewController no? I only looked briefly
Ohh I see. It looks like none of the other coordinators are using the base coordinator class though. It doesn’t look like a basecoodinator adds much value here.
I have the same implementation in my app, the only difference is that I don’t use storyboards, so I don’t need the Storyboarded protocol. 
Yeah, the way humans measure time (i.e., mapping an atomic clock's sequential output to arbitrary human units) sounds tough. We're never going to crack that nut. In comparison, the way humans write text (i.e., encoding any scribbles they feel like inventing, including small pictures, color variations, compositions of other scribbles in the same space, changing direction in mid-stream, defining arbitrary associations between scribbles, sorting chunks of scribbles in different ways for different groups of people, ...) should be a piece of cake!
Hi! Im starting to learn some Swift and want to call some bash commands. I have found examples that works like this: [https://gist.github.com/andreacipriani/8c3af3719da31c8fae2cdfa8c21e17ba](https://gist.github.com/andreacipriani/8c3af3719da31c8fae2cdfa8c21e17ba) &amp;#x200B; But here comes the problem, when using bash command lpstat -s, its Locale and I want all output to be default (English) In bash I can use SOFTWARE= LANG=C lpstat -s (and its working fine) But how to I call this command using Swift, so the output gets Locale?
How would it fail if they stayed in the same spot? Even with location that could update without significant movement, you’d be sending the same location at 7pm. If you store the last received location, you could always just send the last known
It was a combiniation of one of the background layers being the wrong color, and the separator inset being off. Thanks!
I had no idea you could do that! Thanks!
Without seeing code, my first guess is that your controls are in a scroll view. Look at delaysContentTouches for uiscrollview if that is the case and set it to false. 
Looks like you solved it correctly. It seems long and repetitive because it kind of is—at least without additional context. It looks like it would be better to put numberOfImpossibleThings and phrase as parameters to your impossibleThingsPhrase function. But simplicity in that sense is not the purpose of the lesson, rather it is to show you how functions can be used together. In that sense it accomplishes the goal.
Thank you. I was just over thinking it. Which made me think it needed to be more simple. 
Thank you 
MVVM-C (with a reactive framework, although it's optional) really works wonders compared to traditional MVC. 
Have you tried testing it on an actual device? I've found things work differently outside of the simulator from time to time.
This is great! I have been wrestling coordinators with a tab bar in my own project. Quick question. Why do your viewControllers have a reference to your coordinators? I'm assuming it's for telling the coordinator to push/present/etc. Maybe delegates and closures could assist there! Great work!
Great post and very timely, setting up Vapor on my Ubuntu server now
What do you really want to do? If it’s only fetching data from HTML I’d download the HTML and use XPath (using for instance https://gist.github.com/Frizlab/54c17bbb9921a82fb854697dbf48719a).
Awesome! The great news is that it works on 18.04, perfectly. Let me know if you have any questions.
I’m trying to parse that html for a specific table, then convert that html table to swift 2D array. I’m not familiar with XPath, does it have the equivalent functionality? Like I said it’s working perfectly in the simulator, so I am reluctant to blow everything up and do it in a different way when it’s likely some minor fix that would get it working on the actual device as well. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/iosprogramming] [HTML Parser works in simulator but not on actual device](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/b46ew5/html_parser_works_in_simulator_but_not_on_actual/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
Firing a WebView just to parse some HTML is a **strong** overkill and should be avoided. If anything because it is also unstable (in your case it doesn’t work on device for instance…). Download the URL in a data structure and parse it with XPath. You’ll get highly better performance and more resilience. XPath is not necessarily easy to get around with, but there are plenty of example on the internet.
There’s also the issue that extended graphemes clusters can be composed of an arbitrary number of code points, making random access to UTF-32 chars meaningless, and to graphemes clusters impossible. (No encoding can really resolve that issue; it’s just a consequence of Unicode.)
I am using JavaScript to input data onto the page from the app and submit it, which returns data on that page, which I then extract, without the URL changing. Would XPath work in this situation? 
If you attach the Safari debugger when running on device, is the HTML the same? My guess is it's the input into SwiftSoup is different, not a difference in parsing between device and simulator.
&gt; delaysContentTouches Yup, same thing on my iPhone 7
No. But you should see what XHR is launched when you submit your input and fetch this XHR only. And then parse the result of the XHR. It’ll probably be JSON. If it’s HTML, parse using XPath…
Broken constraints can be a PITA. Are you setting all constraints in storyboard or are you also setting some programmatically? If they are all in the storyboard, your best bet is to cycle through every single constraint in your cells view via the hierarchy side bar and find the ones that show up as red. I can't tell *exactly* which ones are causing your problem from the log dump, but my suspicion is that it is a trailing constraint and an alignment constraint that are causing it. 
Try watching Paul Hegarty’s Stanford course cs193p. It covers Swift language and iOS development. It is available on iTunes and YouTube for free. I’ve started from this course and likes it a lot. Also, try reading https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language on official Swift site - it is available in ePub format for free download. The official site also contains useful guides for writing your code like naming, etc.
Seconded. I got my start this way. And he does a great job conveying good practice.
Try pasting the constraint error into wtfautolayout.com and see whats the underlying issue
I am setting all of them through storyboard with the exception of the table view height. Thank you for the advice. I am going to work through them again and see what I can find.
This is a great resource. Thank you
Thanks for your help - it wasn't actually caused by that but your suggestion helped me find the offending code by removing sections until I figured out what was really causing the issue. It's caused by a UITapGestureRecognizer that toggles a boolean value which decides which units to use for data in a table view, but I'm not sure how to fix it at the moment. The code that, when removed, fixes the problem is: override internal func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // other setup let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap(sender:))) view.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture) tapGesture.numberOfTapsRequired = 2 } @objc private func handleTap(sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) { if sender.state == .ended { showMilliseconds = (showMilliseconds ? false : true) if showMilliseconds { timeLabel.text = "Time" } else { timeLabel.text = "Samples" } DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in self?.durationDisplay.reloadData() } } } When I remove `let tapGesture = ...` the segmented controllers work fine. It makes sense now, I think - the tap gesture recognizer is waiting to see if the view is tapped a second time, and when it times out the bottom press is registered. What's the best way of dealing with this? Sorry for being clueless - this is my first foray into iOS development and I'm stilling trying to wrap my head around it.
Try using https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizerdelegate/1624208-gesturerecognizer Set your view controller as the delegate for the tap gesture recognizer then implement this method and have it always return true. I think it will let the segmented control trigger immediately because the tap gesture recognizer won’t wait to see if there is the second tap. 
Put a breakpoint at your step 1. Step through to see which line causes the crash. If it's on this line, let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "EmojiCell", for: indexPath) as! EmojiTableViewCell try breaking it up into 2 statements. &amp;#x200B; let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "EmojiCell", for: indexPath) let emojiCell = cell as! EmojiTableViewCell &amp;#x200B; Then check the value of cell after stepping past that step.
Well the breakpoint shows that the crash definitely happens when I run the update line. "cell.update(with: emoji)" &amp;#x200B; It steps into the function and then crashes. Do I need to "unwrap" the emoji object or maybe since it's a new class do I have to initialize it?
No luck so far... Seems to be adjusting to my text length &amp;#x200B;
No luck... It seems like the content is resizing to my text despite the constraints [https://imgur.com/997nbzA](https://imgur.com/997nbzA)
&gt;let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "EmojiCell", for: indexPath) &gt; &gt;let emojiCell = cell as! EmojiTableViewCell The problem is likely you either have a mismatched identifier, or you haven't changed the class in UI builder from NSTableViewCell to your custom EmojiTableViewCell. That's why I suggested breaking the single line into the two, like above. If it's a problem with the identifier, then cell will be nil. If it's a problem with the casting to your custom cell class, then the second line will fail.
Tracking a user's location in the background has serious privacy issues. Apple intentionally doesn't provide what you're asking for.
Of course, however I still can't quite figure out how tracking location (or running any code at all) once every 24 hours is worse than tracking location and running code every time the user moves by 500 meters, privacy or battery wise...
Hi mnbolson! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that. If the content you were submitting *was* in fact related to the subject of Swift programming, please [message the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswift&amp;subject=Please%20review%20my%20removed%20App%20Store%20submission&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/b4b6ix/app_feedback_and_comments/) to have it reviewed.

First, Apple doesn't make any guarantees that moving 500 meters triggers a significant location change notification. It's significantly more complex than that, though I don't know specifics. Second, it's about who has control. If the app decides at what time it can get location, the app is in control. But the user is in control of the location of the device. That alone cuts off the worst of the potential privacy abuse.
You could use a regular expression replace. Like so: \`"Words \[G\]more words, even more \[Em\]words".replacingOccurrences(of: "\\\\\[\[\^\];\]\*\\\\\]", with: "", options: .regularExpression, range: nil)\` 
I've never had non-trivial Swift code work identically in Darwin and Linux. Given all of the Linux-specific issues still present in the compiler, is it reasonable to run Vapor natively on a Mac, if you plan to deploy on Linux? I don't even see any tests here (beyond hitting a hello-world endpoint with curl). I'm sure the Vapor folks test their work on both platforms but in any web app most of the code will eventually be something other than the web framework. I'd be interested to hear how well the Xcode integration works when running Vapor in a VM.
Is there any reason to set the accessibility properties in the view controller, rather than Interface Builder?
I assume that it's coming when you print the value you get back from `readline`. That's because readline returns `String?` which is an optional String, as if you call readline when EOF has already been returned it returns `nil` rather than a string. Whenever you print optionals, you get that warning, alerting you that you're trying to print an optional, rather than a flat (what is the term for a non-optional anyway?) type. You can get rid of that warning in a few different ways which you should learn when you read more on optionals and how to use them.
so should i define readline or print as a string? &amp;#x200B;
XPath? Now I have two problems...
&gt; However I can't seem to find any way to do this with apple's restrictions on background activity. As a user, I'm relieved! This sounds sketchy as #*&amp;(@!.
So I want to have users create customizable *(and unpredictable)* “presets” where each preset will be stored as a dictionary *(with nested dictionaries inside)* that will then be converted into JSON and stored as a string in CoreData. Would any of this be considered bad practice, or can any of it be made more efficient? Thanks!
Well, sorry to have sketched you out. If it's any relief, the user would very deliberately allow the app to store the location on the device, without sending it to anyone. If you really want to be sketched out however, know that I've been trying all day with the "significant change in location" updates that apple allow, and I got way more location updates than the regular 24 hours my app requires. Worrying for privacy and battery life, yet still not what I need ;)
Why the ‘;’ in the middle there?
Yeah accidental, that's not supposed to be in there.
Would you say [this](https://github.com/jabernall24/IceMarvel) is an API wrapper now?
TLDR: change ‘var’ to ‘let’ You made a ‘var’, which is a value that can be changed. A ‘let’ is a value which cannot be changed. If you’re not going to change the value, it’s more memory efficient to use ‘let.’ XCode will compile and your code will work perfectly. But it’s saying it’s better to change your ‘var’ to a ‘let’ since you’re not changing the value anyways. 
1st: its not an error. Its a warning. 2nd: you obviously declared a constant property and didnt use it.
It's just a warning. It's telling you that you defined something as 'name', but then didn't use it later in your code. You can remove the definition, or literally just replace it with an underscore if it's the result of a function call that you don't need.
You created a value called ‘name’ but you never used it for anything. So Xcode is saying there’s no point in making the value (and taking up memory) if you’re not going to use it. 
you may want to use a better tutorial, you're going to want to unwrap the variable &amp;#x200B;
Well, unless you’re reimplementing the standard library, you can’t define then like that. What you need to do is unwrap the string if the value is not `nil` Then print that unwrapped string, and to take some other appropriate action if it is nil. Since you’re new to the language and probably don’t know how to do that, I highly recommend downloading and reading Apple's books, [Intro to App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11) and [App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11). For the moment, you could probably just read the section on Optionals, but I recommend reading it all.
&gt; While it would consume more memory, it supports faster access to arbitrary offsets and easier string manipulations. No, because Swift strings separates characters by grapheme cluster boundaries, not Unicode scalars. &gt; Maybe combining character and modifier support made arbitrary access less helpful. Well, it’s a bit more than character and modifier. 
You never assigned it? As in in the if let.. block do self.keyboard = keyboard
Delegate protocols are a way to notify a different class that it should execute a function. A Google search will give lots of sources for info on how to implement. Here’s one example: https://www.appcoda.com/swift-delegate/ 
Personally I fall into the "crash gracefully" crowd because otherwise you're walking into a world of hurt in the long run. Better to make a more solid app over iterations instead of burying bugs and leaving people occasionally confused. But that's just my $0.02.
I avoid regex because it often causes more problems due to mistakes in setting up the regex. Not that it can't solve this problem because this is a relatively simple one. Here is a non-regex solution: let foo = "Words, [G]more words , even more [Em]words" var sentinel = false let filtered = foo.reduce(into: "") { switch (sentinel, $1) { case (false, "["): sentinel = true case (true, "]") : sentinel = false case (true, _): break default: $0.append($1) } } print(filtered) // "Words, more words , even more words" 
Same thing we told you last time. Your keyboard property has not been initialized. It’s nil. 
I have recently been working with promises and hate them with a passion. Why? Because when you abstract everything and hit a breakpoint, you can't find shit about the promise or the context it existed within. Helpers made to help provide that info to someone debugging someone else's promise would be massively helpful. People have to debug what you write. Help them. Don't make it a pain in the ass for them and hide everything behind a block or a pointer. Give them inspectable items that show them context of the action represented by the promise.
I develop on Xcode on my Mac and deploy to Ubuntu later. Rarely have I run into an issue where something works on the Mac and not on Ubuntu. In this case, I was using the String constructor with a format parameter which was not accepted on Linux: `String(format: "%@:%@", username, password)` You can read more details about issues like this here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42670593/string-does-not-conform-to-expected-type-cvararg It does happen and I wish there was a flag or something so when the code is compiled these kind of APIs aren't allowed when running on the Mac but it does happen.
People assume that in most of the programming languages when you define empty variable like: `var keyboard : KeyboardView!` This is just definition, it does not initilaize. You can write `keyboard = KeyboardView()` into `viewDidLoad` to give a default value to your view to be used later in the code. Or you can simply change `var keyboard : KeyboardView!` into `var keyboard = KeyboardView()`
BINGO!
I totally agree debugging promises and coroutines can be a pain, but they add so much value I love them regardless. 
What’s up m8
You can add below code just before making your network request. This will ensure that your app is given enough but limited time to execute something: var backgroundTask = 0 backgroundTask = UIApplication.shared.beginBackgroundTask(withName: "BackgroundTask") { UIApplication.shared.endBackgroundTask(UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier(rawValue: backgroundTask)) backgroundTask = UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier.invalid.rawValue }.rawValue 
Yes!!! I have got recommendation from other developer to do that! I however wanted to ask if I call same network request 3 time, will it create problem if unique identifier is same , like in this example
Yeah. U are right. Most app does that. But the third party SDK - Login Radius which my app was using - was not having this logic built. They were asking the app to make request to refresh the access token while it is still alive,i.e not expired. So the app needed to find an optimum solution to refresh the token judiciously. Please note that Login Radius has built this logic currently. So we need not do anything to add such scheduler kind of thing.🤗
You mean the apple developer scholarship forum? What is the question?
Yeah! I wanted to see about what the rules are exactly about using companies logos and names. Technically a logo would usually fall into issues with the trademark, not copyright. I actually took a computer science ethics class last semester and we discussed how a logo for a company is always fair use unless you are trying to make money off of the logo. I’m not sure if I’m answering my own question or if I’m thinking about it in the wrong way. As far as the names, simply, can I use another companies name in my playground? 
I think it should answer your question: \&gt; You may include third-party open source licensed code and/or public domain images and sounds, with credit and an explanation of why it was used. &amp;#x200B; It's from the Terms and Conditions
Sweet! Also, where do I give this credit? Just in the playground?
I guess. Or in the playground’s description. Good luck ;) 
I used to say exactly the same thing about compilers, when trying to justify writing everything in assembly language. It turns out that higher-level constructs are actually better, in the long run, and "my tools are bad" is a poor excuse for avoiding them, and only a temporary one. Remember when hitting "Debug" on your Apple computer had a 50/50 chance of crashing the whole OS? (I sure do.) Today, nobody avoids C because they're afraid the debugger is incapable of stepping through their function. If debugging promises with this module is a bad experience, then help contribute to the tooling to make it better. Don't just complain that blocks and pointers are tough to debug. They're not going away. 
It does not work still.. right now I am getting sometimes this exception, when app has returned from foreground and started network request: **2019-03-23 18:53:18.223702+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] \[BoringSSL\] nw\_protocol\_boringssl\_error(1584) \[C4.1:2\]\[0x127e6d260\] Lower protocol stack error: 53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.224145+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] \[BoringSSL\] nw\_protocol\_boringssl\_error(1584) \[C1.1:2\]\[0x127d30cb0\] Lower protocol stack error: 53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.224298+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] \[BoringSSL\] nw\_protocol\_boringssl\_error(1584) \[C3.1:2\]\[0x127e67050\] Lower protocol stack error: 53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.242647+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[4:0x283882b80\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.242726+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[4:0x283882b80\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.244816+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[1:0x283891800\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.244882+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[1:0x283891800\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.246648+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[3:0x283881e00\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.246720+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] TIC Read Status \[3:0x283881e00\]: 1:53** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.251617+0200 testing\[1202:109838\] Task &lt;BA3A0B39-1065-44CA-8A02-90669BE4A531&gt;.&lt;22&gt; HTTP load failed (error code: 53 \[1:53\])** **2019-03-23 18:53:18.252705+0200 testing\[1202:110215\] Task &lt;BA3A0B39-1065-44CA-8A02-90669BE4A531&gt;.&lt;22&gt; finished with error - code: 53**
hi guys anyone can give me an ides why im not a developer but my developer its aying that's ok to buffer 2 min its somehow normal do you agree ? I dont think so ,me neither ...
With what?
Have you tried Meetup?
Can you elaborate on what you are trying to do?
Placing the order.
Lmao
I’m very sorry, I was using the reddit app to post and it wasn’t letting me add info for some reason, my bad. My question was, why is the tutorial guy storing the toppings constant in an Array of the Topping enum? I mean, I could get the same result just by doing this, right: let toppings: Topping instead of let toppings: [Topping] ? Thanks for helping, anything tech related isn’t my forte, and learning some form of coding was a NYR I want to stick to. 
Hey, thanks for replying, can you have a look at my comment above? Thank you! 
Can you reupload the code as audiobook so I can understand it better?
Hahahaha you funny dick have your upvote 
No, but that's a good idea. I'll go check it out.
Man I’m getting my balls roasted today 
This stores one `Topping`: let toppings: Topping This stores multiple `Topping` in a preset order: let toppings: [Topping] 
Well, you're not making it easy to help you out. People will be better able to help if you post code as text and actually add comments as to what kind of help you need.
I understand, and I apologise. Maybe I should delete my post and put it back up tomorrow, it’s pretty late up where I am and I should’ve articulated it better. My bad, and thanks! 
I'd leave it up and just clarify. It's not late everywhere around the world and people will have a chance to help over the course of hours rather than in the moment.
Then why did he store •let crust: Crust• instead of •let crust: [Crust]• ? Thanks for your help, I really do appreciate it
He is storing the toppings array in the pizza, not the topping enum. The array has elements of type Topping. **let topping: Topping** would be just one topping. This is just a constant not an array. **let toppings: [Topping]** would be a constant array of toppings. So you can have cheese and mushrooms on your pizza. 
Because it makes no sense to have multiple `Crust`, how can they be both thick and thin at the same time? In that case you want one option.
I understand, but then why not also do the same thing with the crust? That is, why not write: let crust: [crust] ? Thanks for your help, man. I honestly appreciate it 
Because your pizza can only have one type of **Crust**. It can‘t be thick and thin at the same time. 
Holy crap I can’t even order a pizza like a normal person. Thank you so much, it makes sense now. 
I too have had to debug “someone else’s promise” on many occasions, and I understand the frustration you may be facing. But I believe your comment to be mainly based on your experiences with using things like this in general and not this particular library, per se. Making things easier to test and debug is actually what this is for. You can tap in anywhere along an operation path, set breakpoints, inspect memory, override dispatch queues, label the actions, create snapshots, etc. It exposes everything, yet still helps you to emphasize the intent. Your high-level code tells a story, while the low-level code can be organized and inspected however you need, without actually hiding anything. I guess I’m just not sure what else you would like/need for it to do. Have you encountered something specific that is causing you trouble?
I understand, thank you so much. I guess I’ll have someone else call dominoes now on
Glad to help.
My other computer is an Apple-II. I definitely remember. Fortunately, its designers provided a master kill switch on the back. 🙂
That's the problem right there, you aren't ordering pizza! 🤣
If you think promises are bad in that regard, observables in Rx must be absolute hell. I personally think Promises strikes the right balance between higher concepts and debugging ability. Rx seems to be overkill in most cases and nested closures can certainly be helped out with Promises to simplify control flow.
I can’t tell you how genuinely happy I am that your issue wasn’t technical, but it was because you forgot how pizzas work xD you have my upvote.
What would it mean to have a pizza that had both thin and thick crust?
If I ever need a double crusted pizza I’m calling you
Hey, I'm not coding in Swift, but I'm trying to interpret some Swift code so that it can be translated into Java. If you could help me understand what is happening here, that'd be great! Here's a function I am trying to interpret: &amp;#x200B; `static func ToByteArray&lt;T&gt;(_ value: T) -&gt; [UInt8] {` `var byteArray: [Byte]!` `var value = value` `withUnsafePointer(to: &amp;value) {` `$0.withMemoryRebound(to: Byte.self, capacity: MemoryLayout&lt;T&gt;.size) {` `byteArray = Array(UnsafeBufferPointer(start: $0, count: MemoryLayout&lt;T&gt;.size))` `}` `}` &amp;#x200B; `return byteArray` `}` &amp;#x200B; 'Byte' is a typealias of UInt8. From what I understand, since it takes a generic type, I think it's splitting any value up into an array of bytes as it's represented in memory from its starting memory address up to its length. Is that what's happening here? Thanks
Hoping this is easy. I have a dynamic tableview embedded in a UIViewController with custom cells containing two labels and a textfield. I have a button below the tableview and when pressing I would like to hide one of the labels and unhide the text field. How would I implement that in the IBAction for the button? Would I do it elsewhere? I’ve tried searching for a solution for awhile now with no clear answer. 
There are two iOS meetups - "Tampa iOS Dev" and "Tampa Bay Cocoaheads". If you're a newbie, go to the first one. If you're not, look up the second one (I'm the organizer). It's been on hiatus for the first part of the year but is about to start back up.
Exactly what I'm looking for! Thanks a bunch man.
Personally, I would avoid NotificationCenter because can make you lose control of your code pretty quickly. If you want to avoid a dependency with RxSwift you can try implementing a light version of the [Observer patter](https://medium.com/@samstone/design-patterns-in-swift-observer-pattern-51274d34f9e3), the one which RxSwift is based on. If not, delegation is the way to go.
Bring on the hella opinionated posts lol. It depends on how you have decided to architect your app, honestly. As far as RxSwift is concerned - done right, it can make things beautiful. But done poorly, and you end up with a living nightmare. I've seen people lose their job because they decided to commit to using RxSwift and it was done poorly and cost the company a lot of money. That said - it is a lot of work to do RxSwift right. You have to be committed, you and everyone on your team has to live RxSwift and Rx in general. If not, it'll fall apart. The main project I work on uses an MVP-C architecture. Most of the data passing we do happens in either a delegation pattern or by passing info back through a completion closure via the coordinator. We use Notification Center sparingly to do certain things, and it works well, but we generally prefer a rule of "try another solution first, if you absolutely can't do it any other way, use a Notification". The reason being is if you're not careful you can end up with race conditions or multiple listeners firing off and it becomes a nightmare to debug if something goes wrong. That's just from my experience though. Others might have, like, a different opinion man. 
Haha, you took it well. Don't worry I thing everyone makes mistakes when asking questions. Sometimes I ask stackoverflow and they are like "What?!" and I'm like yeah... I don't even know what I asked.
I appreciate the insight! Definitely going to check out the Observer pattern you linked.
Haha i thrive off debates. Thanks for the good info! Would you say you’ve been able to gain a lot using the Coordinator? It seems super beneficial with avoiding a lot of singletons by using dependency injection. Just seems like a pain to implement lol.
I've never liked NotificationCenter because I can't step through the post &lt;-&gt; handle transition in the debugger. I much prefer delegation, when I can use it since I **can** step through the calls in the debugger.
Well, we still have a lot of singletons and our code... And well we just have some skeletons in our closet in general, but the coordinator pattern does help us remove one more responsibility from the view controller. And it's actually not all that painstaking! It does take some setup, but the extra work is definitely worth it. Here's a good basic coordinator setup: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps
That’s a great point i didn’t even think much about debugging implications 😅
Came back late and looking at the comments you deserve some light hearted roasting. Good luck!
I don’t understand how this can get out of control. For example if I have a listview which opens a viewcontroller when an item is pressed, I fire off a notification from the view controller when the data changes, to notify the table view to reload. Would this not be an appropriate use of the Notification Center?
Problem is not use NotificationCenter for just ONE task. Problem is that it’s seems so handy that you start using (almost) everywhere. Then is when you lose control of your code flow and debugging is painful. At least, that has been my experience so far. 
Ah right. I typically only use it for simple events between view controllers. I still use singletons for managing the session, api, storage, etc. 
Well, if you _love_ 200 frame stack traces (mostly recorded, so you can't read the variables) then RxSwift is for you!
If you notice performance issues then you can use multiple centers instead of just the default one. If you want to use Notification Center a lot, I would recommend implementing your own which supports typed notifications instead of guard leting all the stuff from the userInfo dictionary.
I'd go with RxSwift. You have to be disciplined and use it correctly, but it encapsulates all those other techniques in a consistent, logical framework that also works properly for multithreading. Not to mention the code is way easier to read than a bunch of nested callbacks or notification events - see "callback hell".
I haven't been seeing many performance issues, but I still going to look into the typed notifications as you suggested
That's valid, I've been struggling trying not to become too dependent on a framework but it seems the benefits maybe too good
I'm in that spot now. Working on a project where RxSwift was considered. Decided that I would try Rx on a separate project in order to discover the pros and cons, without affecting current development efforts. 
At least it supports UTF-8 literals. That's at least enough to write a library for proper Unicode support.
Fun fact: Apple and IBM spent $100M on their current unicode library. Not on purpose, though. It (ICU) was the only code that survived Taligent. 
I've built my own observable layer on top of `NotificationCenter` and it works pretty well with minimal code. As long as you architect your app around those observations you shouldn't miss the synchronous nature of other observer systems. The most important thing is to build a persistent system around the notifications so that observers will always get the latest value, no matter when they start subscribing. `NotificationCenter` doesn't give you that ability by default. So while there's a little work to do to make it fully robust and Swifty, I've found it perfectly serviceable. 
You can also use kvo and observe properties if you need. Swift 4 improved this API quite a bit. 
Oof.
If I’m understanding what your trying to do correctly, this sounds like a job for delegate and protocol for the cell. 
Yes, you can overuse NotificationCenter, but my general rule of thumb is: use first party until it no longer works for your situation. If you absolutely cannot use delegation or NotificationCenter for your purposes, then look into something else. Imagine if you were inheriting this project from another developer. Would you be able to understand it quickly, or would it take learning a whole different architecture or tool. Try to keep it as “regular” as possible, and avoid over-complication. NotificationCenter is a great tool when used correctly. I’ve been part of projects that have done a very good job of using them in the right situations. Use delegation first, but if that is not working, scale up to NotificationCenter. If that for some reason doesn’t work, look to third party. 
I just release my first iOS app, [Just Timers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?mt=8), which lets you create multiple reusable named timers and assign Siri Shortcuts to them. It’s pretty simple to start, but I’m hoping to add some more features soon enough. Feedback and reviews are greatly appreciated!
I 100% agree with "use first party until it no longer works for your situation" and that has been something I've definitely become more cognizant of. p.s. I remember those days when i was using 30+ pods on small personal projects LOL
The problem when you have so many event the fired from anywhere from your code. When something is changing, it quite hard to debug where it coming from. And since it broadcast the message, you should be aware who is listening to that message. My experienced when we have leaks, and it seems the ViewController still observe the notifications, and it crash when it received the notifications. We spend whole month to figured it out, because the we didn’t realize it was different view controller until we print the memories
Reactive programming is another new trend. It has its merits, absolutely, but I ask: is it entirely necessary? Unless I find simplicity or utility in implementing the reactive approach, I won’t use it. If it suits the project then go for it. But if you do, you have to use it well. As others have stated, reactive programming gone wrong can be an absolute bitch to read for someone joining a project, let alone debug. There are places in app development where it makes sense and even makes things easier, but I’m generally not a fan of the whole-app is reactive just because it can be paradigm. 
You need a variable to store the hide/unhide usually a Boolean. You button modifying the variable and call table view reload. And you need to configure your cell’s subview’s isHidden property base on the variable you set before. Hope this can you? If not Iet me know
I want have a pizza now 🍕🍕🍕
Or reloadRowsAtIndexPath ...
That reasoning seems really silly to me. It's like you have a nail you need to drive in, someone offers you a hammer, and you respond by saying "no no, trying to avoid external help" while you frantically rummage around for heavy hammer-like objects. One of the comments above suggests you roll your own Observable pattern, and I cant help but think "what the fuck?" You'll roll your own observable, you'll integrate it with NotificationCenter, then you'll realize you need to use it UI bindings, so you'll integrate it into that too, and before you know it, you've invented your own Rx. The difference of course, is that your hand rolled implementation will undoubtly be buggier, slower, and will lack the community, the documentation and examples. It will certainly confuse new devs even more (that seems to be a common concern in these comments, too)
Forget that RxShit. Nothing good ever comes from it. 
Http server communication is deprecated IIRC, you could add a key value in your plist in the past, not sure if that still works. Not sure about your audio code. 
Finally someone who remembers this.
By “structures” do you mean `struct`s? The `property`s of a struct is not different from the propertys of a `class`. So I will interpret your questions as if you were asking about properties in general. Have you read the Swift Lang documentation about properties? https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html The most important is the difference between stored property and computed property.
Thanks for replying; yes I meant structs. I have yet to reach classes (IK swift is supposed to be super easy but I feel like I've reached the begging of the uphill of the bell curve). Thanks for helping!
Good, start with structs and the classes. In general try to prefer structs and change into class when needed.
I haven't used swift since version 2, but Structures are pretty common among most languages. Also in swift IIRC pretty much the only difference between a class and a struct are how they are passed in the program (reference vs value). So the following should be useful to both in your case regarding properties: &amp;#x200B; A structure is exactly what is defined in the dictionary ( definition: the arrangement of and relations between the parts or elements of something complex ). &amp;#x200B; In that definition properties are the equivalent of those "parts or elements". A structure allows you to group those elements together so that they become meaningful. Real World Example: &amp;#x200B; If I just say "name", I could be referring to pretty much anything that has a name, right? A Human has a name, a Dog has a name, etc... Name is just a thing, it doesn't mean much since it's not "conSTRUCTed" into something useful. Lets make a human: &amp;#x200B; `Struct Human {` `let name = "Sam"` &lt;--This is a name property of a Human, this would be a stored constant property (every human is now named sam, you would want to init a value) `var age = 30` &lt;--- This is an age property of a Human, this is a stored property that can change, since Humans age. `}` So now I can say [Human.name](https://Human.name) and now name is meaningful, since I know it is a Human property. &amp;#x200B; And that is a property, it just stores information regarding the structure. Then you get into the different types of properties (Stored, Computed, etc) . If you needed more info on these let me know and I'll update it. &amp;#x200B; Just remember these two things and it should get you more experienced with structs/properties &amp;#x200B; 1. Properties are just variables that don't mean much unless they are attached to something 2. Structs just group properties together so they make more sense. &amp;#x200B; The thing about programming and computers for most people is that they tend to think all computer/programming things are super complex, when the truth is that they are really just a lot of really simple things built together to make things complex. &amp;#x200B;
Do you have any experience in other languages? I think starting out in general is hard, then gets a lot easier once you grasp the basics. And then it can get really hard again, lol
&gt;Do you have any other experience in other languages? I should've mentioned; no I don't. Swift is literally my first experience with "coding". I started coz I have so much respect for programmers, goddamit how do you guys know which number and which alphabet to use, when? To me, before I started swift, it was just a bunch of numbers, punctuations and alphabets on screen. &amp;#x200B; I now know starting out with Python would've been better, but oh well. I only need to cover structs and classes to finish the basics now anyway. Thanks for your help anyway! &amp;#x200B;
This actually clears up loads of doubts I had, thank you so much for taking the time out to write this! &amp;#x200B;
It's usually 'structures and classes', both of which are types. And they can have properties defined on them (within their scope) so you can create specific instances of the types with those properties. I'd recommend that you go through Apple's official Swift 5 guide. You'll find pretty much everything you need there. https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html But, go through the 'Structures and Classes' chapter first. And then move on to 'Properties'. If you are looking for an even simpler explanation of the same, I cannot recommend Big Nerd Ranch Swift Programming Guide enough for that. It's an amazing book for Swift beginners. Good luck.
You can always see videos in youtube regarding structs, you will see different examples from different people and will figure it out, I did that and finally understood this subject, good luck!
Can we get a learn swift subreddit? Structs really? That stuff is so incredibly easy. We should be talking about functional programming here. Not structs 
Not everyone is an expert in everything. OP might be starting out and wants to learn it right? Although I do like the idea of r/learnswift

You made some great points and for the most part i’m with you. Definitely in many cases i’d say wtf to a person trying to recreate the wheel. My hesitation stems from being on projects that become bloated by frameworks that were only used for 1 or 2 things or that just add sugar over the apple apis. And in this specific case the added complexity that RxSwift brings i felt like it may be overkill. I’m definitely still growing as a developer so i’m trying to find the balance between something that doesn’t require a outside framework vs something that does. 
Yeah man check out /r/iamverysmart 
Thank you, yes I did just start out, and swift is my first language too! I’m sorry, I didn’t know of the learn swift sub, I’ll check it out!
I apologise if my query was too easy for you. I will post them on r/learnswift from now onwards. Having said that, I was only asking for a learning resource, if that bugs you so much, you may want to take the dick out of your ass and suck on it the next time you feel the need to add zero value to a discussion. Cheers! 
check out the [NSAppTransportSecurity](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) setting in your Info.plist file. You should probably add the NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsForMedia setting. I think that will cover what you are trying to do.
So true. RxSwift makes you eat the whole elephant. If you "need" it "just for this one little thing", you don't need it. You have to commit to the learning curve of using it properly. I've seen the "badly done" RxSwift and debugging it is a nightmare. OTOH, I've seen a project that had an "expert" involved, and it worked well. (and the expert was a good mentor).
You can add breakpoints inside the notification receiving function and click continue and the it will pause when the notification is received.
\+1 for the persistent system around notifications.
Lol nice insult... at least I know how to code and what structs are. I’ll be sucking my dick over here looking at my 6 figure salary paychecks I get for coding in swift 
That sure you’re gonna be single forever huh Anyway, come on man, it was just one question, I even promised not to ask questions again here if they’re waaay to simple. Let’s just call it quits, let’s go back to learning swift!

Ok fine. Truce. Sorry. Have a good day mate. 
Tools in the toolbox... there are many ways to accomplish that type of interaction, and a given app will use many different techniques depending on the need. If you have a one-to-one communication need, delegation is great, and fits the Apple ecosystem very well. A one-to-many is better with notifications. There’s also KVO, and closures which can have great uses and benefits. Use the pattern that fits the given situation, and don’t be afraid to refactor and change if the needs change.
« Swift is supposed to be super easy » : really not sure about that. A lot of what makes it look easy (type inference mostly) is due to the compiler doing the heavy lifting, but you’ll reach some steps down the road (closures &amp; capture lists, protocols &amp; extensions, functional programming, hell, even optional unwrapping) where you’ll find yourself struggling and that’s completely normal. 
This looks really cool. Going to try it out in a side project. Thanks for the link 
Ok now I’m scared Thanks for the heads up man, it actually would’ve been terrible if I assumed Swift is super easy while simultaneously not getting the hang of it. I’ll try to tough it out, cheers!
Cheers!
I might be in the minority here, but I don't think Rx adds complexity. It's sole existence is to simplify things. Sure it's "one more thing" to learn, but that doesn't make it complex. You know what is complex? The set of first-party patterns used for async handling and reactive programming, each with their own set of quirks and complications. 1. Notification center: global state, nasty force unwrapping of user info dicts, "untraceable" magic 2. KVO: only works with dynamic vars 3. IBOutlets only applies to UI binding. Makes you write lots of small, low-value forwarding methods 4. Call backs: call back hell, hard to group related operations, pyramids of doom, no enforcement to ensure you don't forget to call a callback before function return. Rx unites them all under one simple API. Now that's simple.
Don't sweat it :) &amp;#x200B; Btw, to answer you question regarding programming resources, I actually found Apple's iBook "The Swift Programming Language" really useful and well written, and it's free. Some topics may be confusing at first (closures especially), but it gives an extensive tour of the language and I regularly go back to this book. I think everyone should start with this one ; other resources are also super useful, such as *Ray Wenderlich* website tutorials, and [*objc.io*](https://objc.io) books that go deeper into some subjects ("Advanced Swift" is a must), though the latter are definitely for experienced programmers. Good luck and please don't give up, nobody said it would be easy, but it's really rewarding once you start to see clearer :)
Point noted 👏. If Rx ever needs someone for advocacy they need to hire you lol
A wild guess here, but since Swift is heavily inspired by Haskell, might it have something to do with the ‘let a in x’ syntax in Haskell, where a is a variable assignment and x is an expression? Usage example: let y = 2 in y * y
Haha, I wouldn't mind being paid for what I say anyway :p My only concern with Rx is that if it's used correctly, it integrates so heavily into your app and strongly couple's to everything. It's a really hard dependancy to decouple. But this wouldn't worry me too much, because it's so popular and there's such a big following behind it.
Thanks a tonne man, I’ll check them out 
I can relate to the niceness of an unambiguous lookahead. Stuff like `() =&gt; {}` is nice, but damn it's annoying to parse. Especially if you have tuples because `(a, b, c)` could be an argument list or it could be a tuple of variables `a, b, c`. 
I mean, you don't need to take a guess... Just open the linked post, and the person who implemented it explains it.
Are you sure your AVPlayer is not being released? Make sure to make your AVPlayer a variable of your class so it's kept in memory. The simplest example in your AppDelegate.swift ``` var myPlayer: AVPlayer? func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool { let fileUrl = "https://novelnoise.com/Audio/Acoustic:Folk/bensound-acousticbreeze.mp3" let url = URL(string: fileUrl) self.myPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url!) self.myPlayer?.play() return true } ```
May need == instead of =
tried and get "variable binding in a condition requires an initializer"
I can test if you want. PM me.
They are just structures, not Structures. Don't randomly capitalize words. English doesn't work that way. Don't do that.
You have probably declared a variable / constant but didn't use it in code var name = 'Greekfire26' // and the name variable is never used below ... You can solve this by using the 'name' variable var name = 'Greekfire26' self.nameLabel.text = name or, replace the 'name' with '_' , so the compiler know that it won't be used, var _ = 'Greekfire26' 
I assume that `productName` is a UILabel ? self.productName.text is a String type, and pName is a UILabel, you are assigning a UILabel to a String type...? 🤔
Seems like `productData.product.productName` is a non-optional String type? What if you do `self.productName.text = productData.product.productName` directly?
I am now able to stream it within the simulator but not on an actual device. Any advice?
Yes ... and he says "closures are also secret let-expressions". Why is TypesafeSugar downvoted? This guess is exactly right. Out of all the reserved words they could have picked, the choice of "in" was not simply random.
Lmao im an idiot, the device was on silent mode.
&gt; Also in swift IIRC pretty much the only difference between a class and a struct are how they are passed in the program (reference vs value). And the automatic initializers, and how methods are dispatched, and ...
&gt; people hated it less than the alternatives. Sounds reasonably enough to me. 
Hahah it would have been hard to guess that one. Glad you got it working. 
By default Dictation on MacOS mutes audio. There is a System preference to change this under Accessibility / Dictation. Users of my [Transcribe Helper](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/transcribe-helper/id1439157822?mt=12) app need to change this to do the repeat what was said style of transcription.
Hi there I have accessed these settings but am unsure of exactly what should be changed. Could you provide any more information on this?
How will that update the label though?
You can get most of the way there by extending `Notification` with a function to extract a generic type from `userInfo`, as well as one to embed a generic value in `userInfo` when creating notifications.
There's a checkbox marked "Mute audio output while dictating". This defaults to on (which might explain why you don't hear your mp3). You should try turning that off. Of course I'm just guessing as your original question says you are unable to use SpeechRecognizer so perhaps I'm misunderstanding what your problem is.
If you're trying to set the value of your IBOutlet called pName, you need to not declare a new pName. Use the one you already have: pName.text = productData.product.productName Right now you're making a new pName, unrelated to the UILabel, and trying to assign *from* it, not *to* it.
Likely my fault. I am trying code an application that records audio for speech recognizer while simultaneously playing a streamed mp3. This is all to be done through swift 4 for IOS device.
got it working. It was a minor adjustment.
Do you want `if let` instead of just `if`
I want my label pName to update when I get the info from the JSON file
I think `let` and `in` reads quite nicely, feels maths-y.
Not OP but I’ve been in the same boat. Of course we use 3rd party libraries but we’re careful of what we pull in. We won’t ship a production app that has a UI built on a 3rd party framework. Why? Because anyone who has done iOS programming for a few years will know that breaking UI changes are frequent. We used to hardcode our frame sizes, then AutoLayout came out. We used to have separate iPhone and iPad XIBs, now we have universal storyboards. If you had built your UI on third party code (as @zaitsman), you’d be pretty fucked. If you followed Apple’s way you’d be less fucked. 
Oh, we use plenty. The criteria is fairly simple- the lib can’t be foundational. And if it is, there better be a damn good case for time to build vs time to customise (e.g. a calendar view for iOS). This rules out things like Reactive packages, Alamofire, any view composition things. Those that we do end up using are encapsulated in an area of the app behind thin wrappers/protocols so we can swap the entire piece out if it comes to that.
This was my first thought as well. Incorrect use of `path(forResource:`
You could treat arguments as implicit tuples, I suppose... But isn't stuff like this usually mitigated by maximal munch anyway? `=&gt;` should never be confused for `= &gt;` in the lexer. Unless maybe I'm misunderstanding your point.
I have the 12.9 but won’t be home for another hour or so. Feel free to pm though. 
I actually do treat multiple argument functions as taking tuple arguments in the toy language I'm building. But that doesn't fix much because parsing parameter patterns is fundamentally different than parsing tuple literals. I.e. (10, 11, a) is a valid tuple but not a valid parameter declaration. The issue isn't the =&gt; as much as not having a leading token that unambiguously denotes a function definition. Which...now that I'm rereading the post, the `in` syntax doesn't have either. So I guess it's a moot point.
I’m sorry, I didn’t realise it was an iOS question. Great you got it going.
Run a test and find out just how far you have to go to overuse it.
Regarding notifications, Objective-C operates through sending messages. Notifications, messages, not too far apart (conceptually anyway).
That's MASSIVELY important. Unless you wanted to create a log for all of your notifications.
&gt; so many event the fired from anywhere so many event**s*** that* are* fired from
&gt; I've built my own observable layer on top of NotificationCenter and it works pretty well with minimal code. Very nice. I was thinking of the same approach because our code heavily uses promises and it's pretty useless when you hit the debugger and everything's a block pointer.
thank you
&gt; Use &gt; &gt;struct &gt; &gt; to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference. &amp;#x200B; I mean I'm sure there are probably differences but that's from the most recent docs on the site, which I hadn't looked at since swift 2ish, I did look it up after your comment, so under the hood they might be implemented differently, I don't believe it really matters to someone who was asking about properties, but I'll make your day since I think you might want it, you are super smart thanks for sharing that. &amp;#x200B;
If you're asking this question then you might want to do some basic tutorials or read the Apple docs first. 
Yep you’re right it was a pretty dumb question. I figured it out by just reading the code.
Agree. The same as let and var. Give priority to use let, change to var when needed.
So you'll add an extension to every single View / ViewController? 🤔 What do you think of just using NotificationCenter? I want the cleanest and most maintainable solution possible for my App.... :D
You need to set an info.plist key to enable http downloads and enable arbitrary loads.
It does.
Easiest way is to put it in your closure under the `reloadData()` call. That seems like when you want it to scroll. 
What you're trying to achieve isn't possible with an alert controller. You want to use a popover. &amp;#x200B;
This notion gets discussed a bit more [in this thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/why-cant-closures-have-labels-and-be-more-readable/21872/37).
Yes, I would add an extension to every view controller. That's what makes it so clean and maintainable. Notification Center could work similarly, I prefer sticking to delegation when possible (more ingrained in swift, less communication paths, easier to reason about)
So that it sounds more cool also more readable.
Did not see the linked post there and thought this was posted as a question 🥴
www.raywenderlich.com - their books are excellent. Also, search for articles on www.medium.com
Awesome! Thank you
Or rather NEVER use var on properties and use pure functions and lenses instead ;)
You must have a separation between specification and implementation. You usually use { } to make a scope, where { is the beginning and } is the end. But closure starts with { and you don’t want to use two } to close each closure. Because of this it has more sense to use a reserved word like ‘in’ to separate the signature of the closure and the code itself. Best regards 
There are two parts to your code: the optional binding and the assignment. This is the optional binding: if var pName = productData.product.productName { // … } This takes the optional `productData.product.productName`, checks to see if it has a value, and if it has, assigns it to a new variable `pName`, and executes the block. If it doesn't have a value, it doesn't assign it to `pName` and it doesn't execute the block. Then within that block, you have the assignment: self.productName.text = pName This takes the value of `pName` and it puts it in `self.productName.text`. It seems like `productData.product.productName` is not an optional. This means that the optional unwrapping makes no sense. Non-optionals always have values. It's not possible for them not to have values; the type system ensures it. There's no point checking to see if a variable you know *definitely* has a value… has a value. Additionally, you've defined `pName` twice. Once as a property on your view controller which is an outlet, and once as a local variable in one of your methods. These are two different things with the same name. When you are unwrapping the optional to `pName`, you are declaring a new local variable called `pName` that has nothing at all to do with the `pName` outlet. You are not assigning to your label there. You should have a warning telling you that you aren't modifying `pName`. This should be a clue that your code isn't doing what you think it is. Don't ignore warnings. If you get a warning that you don't understand, stop working until you understand what is going on and resolve it. Did you mean to name your outlet `productName`? This is the label you are assigning to with the line of code that does the assignment. If so, then you should rename your outlet. Don't forget you need to break the connection in Interface Builder and then hook it up again, otherwise iOS will try to hook up the outlet to `pName` and crash. 
Sounds good 😊 custom views won’t need it since I have pointers to them in my VCs, so I could maybe call „layoutSubviews“ or something like that? And CollectionView cells will be reloaded with fonts by just calling reloadData right? Also thanks for the fast reply on this old-ish thread 😊 
You can also look on Realm's website. Realm is an alternative to Apple's CoreData (and much more than that), but they are also in the business of organizing interesting talks. Plus, expertise in Realm is very often a strong asset when applying for an iOS dev position. 
Hey /u/closed_caption and /u/ObjectiveClimate, I've just added a [networking example](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Tokamak#networking) to the README with success/error handling. Hope this clarifies the usage for you, please feel free to send me any comments, suggestions, questions or bug reports. Thank you!
`Date` has no knowledge of timezone, it's always assumed to be in UTC time. Internally it's a simple units of time since a reference date in UTC time. So when you print it the default string that is produced is in UTC time. That's why you use `DateFormatter` and you set the time zone, the `DateFormatter` converts the internal time into one with a proper time zone and format.
It's relative to locale. Set the locale for your time.
## Hello All, I'm thinking of enrolling in an Udemy course that uses JSQMessages along with firebase to build a chat app. I emailed the instructor as to why he's not using Messagekit since JSQMessages has been deprecated and replaced by Messagekit. He said he's using version 733 which is stable and works perfectly fine. Also, "Messagekit is new and doesnt have all the functionality of jsq and jsq has less bugs. It will take few years for message kit to reach the level of jsq" I'm currently building an MVP that incorporates a chat and need to get something out asap for feedback. **Can I still use JSQMessages for a few months or even years and not have any trouble?** 
Another question: How to theme stuff that doesn't have a custom class like the default navigation and tab bars?
So, you are saying that i should try converting the "DateFormatter" date to a string rather than using the "Date"?
I'm saying that doing something like `print( Date() )` is always going to output as in UTC time. Any time you coerce a `Date` object to a `String` that's what you're going to get. If you want something different you need to convert that UTC time to another time offset, either through `DateFormatter` or through other means.
So I know nothing about programming on iOS, but I’m interested in making a personal app that would give a 12 second delay when opening specific apps. Like, before I open my reddit app, I have to wait 12 seconds before it allows me to view it. Is this even possible? 
Don't forget **NSAttributedString.**
You mean a calzone?
That looks awesome. 
But you'd still have only one type of crust though
Big nerd ranch. They have a swift book and a iOS programming book. Both are excellent. 
this looks really good
The Swift Programming book by Apple. 
It looks good and clean, but also a bit heavy to be honest, and this is for a pretty barebone example. 
Yeah, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss something from Foundation in favor of something 25 days old. Attributed Strings are expensive. If Prestyler is managing them under the hood, I would need to know how it's optimizing this. Something to watch? Maybe... Something to jump to hastily? Absolutely not.
Sure you are right, it's just a concept/first implementation. I was trying to find similar functionality in existing solutions but all I found was too complex or looking messy. So its my custom wheel here.
Nothing wrong with pragmatism... The introduction was just a bit strong. I lead an app with a large user base and we don't pull in dependencies light heartedly.
I'll look into it thanks, is it good for learning the fundamentals and terms?
it teaches exactly that
I'd like to add some socket based networking to my iOS hobby project this month and next. Can anyone point me to a good tutorial on the Network.framework?
I tried with the Date formatter.locale, by setting it to the correct locale. Still no results. I need to get the current time in milliseconds so I need the date as Date and not String. Any other way I can do that?
Rightfully so. 
I would love to use Swift more effectively for data science. I think we are missing some key, easily implemented libraries that already have great implementation and use in other languages (Python). The main ones that I’m thinking of are Pandas (or a similar library for data frame manipulation) and a complimentary graphing library. As swift 5 release I feel like more people will be willing to put the time and effort into developing these open source libraries due to ABI stability. I could see swift playgrounds being used similarly to Jupyter notebooks. I feel like it will be a few years before we see enough growth to witness a real switch to swift for data science. Large parts of swift are highly focused on iOS development, which honestly is pretty useless for data science.
How do you mean? Milliseconds since what? Can you give an example? [`Date.timeintervalsince1970`](`https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate/1407504-timeintervalsince1970`) is in seconds. It's a [`TimeInterval`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timeinterval) which is just an alias for `Double`. To convert it to milliseconds you can multiply by 1000.
I have to convert the current time to milliseconds. I need it as a parameters to an HTTP request. But, I am unable to get the current time with Date and Dateformatter. It always gives me UTC time which I don't want.
I am also a physicist (well, former physicist anyway) who has shifted to ML. :) While I miss physics sometimes, there are a ton of cool problems in this space. At my company ([Skafos.ai](https://Skafos.ai)) we have approached the problem slightly differently: rather than try to leverage Swift for doing any sort of ML, we have focused on delivering model artifacts and then integrating them into Swift. So, for example, we will use scikit-learn, Turi Create, dlib, TensorFlow, etc to build a predictive model (can be on our platform, though that isn't required!), and then integrate the artifact into Swift code. Our platform Skafos enables this workflow. This gives us the ability to leverage all of the many toolkits out there that are fantastic for ML and use Swift for what it excels at: building apps. 
There is no such thing. There is milliseconds since a certain reference time, usually that's the same as: let milli = Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000) This is the same no matter where you are in the world. The time zone offset is meaningless to this measure.
You’re right except for “easily implemented”
"Swift apps no longer include dynamically linked libraries for the Swift standard library and Swift SDK overlays in build variants for devices running iOS 12.2, watchOS 5.2, and tvOS 12.2." macOS: the least important Apple OS, in 2019.
Likely because of: &gt;Starting with Xcode 10.2, Swift command line tools require the Swift libraries in macOS. They’re included by default starting with macOS Mojave 10.14.4. 
Not entirely sure that’s the conclusion to draw here. Dynamic linking is different on macOS than iOS. Has been since the beginning (ie, iOS didn’t have it anywhere for a long time and macOS has always had it, since NeXTSTEP). 
Thanks for the feedback, I considered splitting that NetworkDemo component into multiple ones, but wasn't sure that would make sense for a simple example. What specifically do you find heavy? 
Man you're all over this sub with extreme cynicism. 
A lot of nested brackets and parenthesis. 
Mac, Apple's smallest product category. Gee I wonder why they don't give it more attention. 
Wait what, is Swift 5 being rolled out in an XCode point release, or am I misunderstanding this?
It's been known for months.
I don't follow. How does macOS/NeXTSTEP having had dynamic linking for 25 years longer than iOS cause it to be *less* well supported by this feature?
I'll try to be more optimistic about my OS being unsupported by this feature we've been looking forward to for years, and not having any new workstation hardware since 2013. Maybe I could do an AMA as a cartoon shark to pass the time?
In case you aren't already familiar with what's new in Swift 5, I've got you covered: - [Watch my new video](https://youtu.be/_Iw4zf8gtqs) - [Read my article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/126/whats-new-in-swift-5-0) - [Download my Xcode playground](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-5-0)
You mean you want it to save all notifications, and re-post the entire history of notifications to observers at the time they're added? No, notifications don't work like that. Why not just call startProcessingIsReady() yourself after calling addObserver?
I wasn't aware of it and I can't find any information about this on [swift.org](https://swift.org). Guess I'll have to tell my team not to upgrade, then.
Sounds like you’d rather move to a different development platform. 
This syntax is my least favorite aspect of Swift (and perhaps the only syntactic aspect I don't love). I guess I'll have to take his word for it that there wasn't a better alternative, but it really doesn't make me dislike it any less.
The available space is less of an issue on MacOS. Internet connection is also generally better.
Any release date yet? (GM not beta)
Why should they not upgrade? You have always been able to compile using an older version of Swift (but not too old, such as Swift 3, of course)
Nicely done. This is a friendly wrapper around attributed strings. Regardless whether one chooses to consume the library as a dependency, or roll their own, this serves as a good reference. I have already wasted enough hours hacking around attributed strings and all their funny ranges and serious attributes. Thank you for this.
But where do you get the old compiler from? As far as I understand, XCode only ships with one version of the Swift compiler or am I mistaken?
Uh, it's just a wrapper. 
It only ships with one version, yes, but it has a compatibility mode for the version that is set in your target‘s SWIFT_VERSION setting (as I said, to a certain limit)
You don’t need notification center to implement the observer pattern. Swift already supports KVO. Notification center is useful for times when you want to announce something application-wide. For example, I often use notifications for announcing events for things like breadcrumbs, analytics, etc. Rather than have a bunch of analytic dependencies strewn all over the place, the generic notifications are routed to my central repositories to handle that. Each repository can selectively choose which notifications they care about. In your case, you may consider creating a download manager, and just use the delegate pattern. Have your code respond to a custom `downloadManagerIsReady()` event, or something along those lines perhaps. Can’t say for sure without more understanding of what you’re building.
But that is solely about compatibility features, right? My biggest pain points when migrating from 4.1.2 to 4.2 were compiler bugs (particularly on Linux). I had a dependency that failed to compile because an expression was too complex for the compiler (but it had been fine in 4.1.2).
Yes, it was today.
* Simple To Do App * An Unsplash Client * Hopefully a blog that will track things I learn as a Junior w/ Small Tutorials if I feel confident enough in the material.
Well, the compiler can certainly behave differently because it’s a different version, true. But generally it shouldn’t. In our team, we are regularly using different versions of Xcode and thus the Swift compiler while working on the same project and haven’t had any trouble at all. Only thing to look after is that everyone stays within the „range“ of supported swift versions, that’s all. However, I have no experience with Swift on Linux since we all work on macOS anyway.
Hot damn. Well there goes my network bandwidth for the next half an hour
Unfortunately, I've been burnt before by such things (both with Swift and with other languages), I find it better to err on the side of caution and use the same version of tools everywhere. But you may be right that these problems appears less often on apple platforms, on Linux unfortunately I've had quite a different experience.
Don’t forget that game from Apple, in the app store... [Swift Playgrounds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492) 
You'll need to build your own layer around notifications if you want to get this behavior. I use a simple class that stores the values to be observed and handles the `NotificationCenter` stuff internally.
This feels like an interview question. “Get the current date and time in milliseconds.” And the correct answer is “what do you mean by date? And what do you mean by time? And milliseconds since what? The Unix epoch? The birth of Romulus and Remus?”
Never miss an opportunity for self promotion. Yeah, no. We can read the bloody documentation, thank you very much.
Salty
Dude, u/twostraws does a huge amount for education in the swift community. Having someone summarize all these changes in an easy to consume format is really valuable. Especially for someone just starting out.
I ended up going with your suggestion, and it wasn’t too bad to write. I’m still doing some testing but so far it’s great!
I'd be surprised if there were more tvOS developers than Mac developers.
I’ve worked at a company where we used RxSwift, for the most part it was really helpful and simplified much of the UI binding, however we did run into an issue where observable were overused and cause a huge performance hit. In moderation I think it’s a great library. 
Honestly, if that's what you're worried about than it will affect any Xcode version change. It's always an entirely new toolchain, and compatibility between minor versions is tested with the same infrastructure as the Swift 4 compatibility mode.
Maybe you missed his username?
Huh? It was today
Ew. I’d actually rather read his write ups than Apple’s documentation as he goes into more depth and explains things easier for me. He also puts it up for free for anyone to learn from. He’s not promoting his books or anything here (even though they’re great) so go on somewhere else 
could you explain further on how the observables were overused? Im definitely going to be using RxSwift and I would like to know what I shouldn't do so I don't run in the same problem. 
It’s possible to create loops and have events being passed around endlessly. The way we set a text field and listened for events caused a loop where when we set the text, it would send us an update event, we would process the new text, and reset it. Alone we probably would have never noticed, but after getting a few hundreds of text fields (in a table view, not recycled properly), we saw a 30+% slowdown in frame rate. It took us almost a month dedicated to fixing multiple similar issues (2 developers)
But this also happened 2(?) years ago. Right before swift 3 was released
A wrapper that your devs will be dependent on once it’s shipped. 
Using NSAttributedString is a mess. This is better. Although there are other libraries that do the same thing. Performance is just... not an issue at all.

Ignore the haters, have a gold!
Oh wow, GM means GM this time. Am used to there being a developer GM downloadable days before the App Store is updated Went to download from the website, it took me to the App Store page in the browser, which took me to the App Store, which had already updated it on my system! Of course have to 'install additional' components on first run. Why the h*ck can't they just install them as part of installing everything else?
Thanks for this. Saving it for later. 
Awesome!
This has been my experience from searching around. Pandas-esque module would be awesome! Just as a general-purpose language, I'm really loving the design of Swift. Looking for an excuse to switch to it ;) If you know of any libraries that are in development for data science purposes (stats, dataframes, visualisation) I'd love to go and help contribute!
Interesting! Does using Swift for TensorFlow help with this workflow at all?
I've also worked at a company where we used RxSwift &amp; in my actual company we use ReactiveSwift. My favourite intro to RxSwift was this project: [https://github.com/jdisho/Papr](https://github.com/jdisho/Papr), it's very complete in terms of applying RxSwift with MVVM, enjoy man and welcome to the iOS FRP world. :-)
Why I can't see swift 5 in the xcode swift versions? we have built a binary library with swift and we need to update ASAP
Good job! (:
This one doesn't seem to be the nightmare that previous version upgrades were. 
Appropriate username 
Worthless release, absolutely worthless. I spent all of 15 minutes migrating my current project. How am I supposed to bill my clients extravagant amounts of hours?! Gone are the golden days of Swift. From now on, it's smooth sailing :(((
You can turn the image into Data type and save it to Core Data (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39822851/uiimage-to-nsdata-for-core-data-in-swift-3-0), but I would advice not to use this method. I recommend saving the image from camera roll to the Documents directory of the app, then save the path to the image in CoreData, maybe make a "imagePath" string attribute for it. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14531912/storing-images-locally-on-an-ios-device) Then you can load the saved image by using `UIImage(contentsOfFile: imagePath)`

Have you tried http://swiftenv.fuller.li/en/latest/ ? 
Curious, I've been wanting to learn Swift and I keep seeing how fast they release versions which deters me. Is each version significantly different than the last?
It is possible to wish your current platform of choice would get better while still preferring it to the other options, you know.
"unit testing" aka sitting on reddit looking at memes.
Each version is more similar to the previous version than the version before it was to its predecessor.
Full disclosure: I haven't used Swift for TensorFlow to build anything, but based on what I do know, it does give you tools to build models in Swift, but it doesn't solve the problem of delivery, which is usually just as much of an organizational challenge as a technical one. In my experience, a model building pipeline is very distinct from a product delivery pipeline, and the code should remain distinct as well. Whether Swift or any other language, the code you use to train a predictive model almost always does not belong in your product; the model artifact does. So while this seems like another tool, potentially awesome for coders who love Swift, I don't think it will inherently make model delivery easier. 
I just migrated over to 4.2 lol
Not anymore. It’s been getting more and more stable each release. With swift 5, the runtime no longer needs to be packaged with your app (it’s part of the OS) so it’s even more stable.
This is the perfect time to learn Swift as now newer versions would be backwards compatible from now onwards. &amp;#x200B;
It's frustrating they made Xcode 10.2 available from macOS 10.14.3 so our old mac mini used for CI can't build swift 5 projects.
I agree. But he’s delusional saying the hardware hasn’t gotten better since 2013. Why are you agreeing with statements like that?
Oh no, hundreds of people are contributing their time to actively developing and improving the language rather. That must be so inconvenient for you.
I've had good experiences with this project: http://dosdude1.com/mojave/ Never done it with a mini but definitely worth looking into
Interesting solution, I'll probably try it, thank you! :)
&gt; Why are you agreeing with statements like that? Where did I do that?
“You can think of String as an artisanal enum, hand-crafted using traditional bit-twiddling techniques in order to produce compact and efficient code.” I prefer my String served in asparagus water.
Hi! From the snippet you have provided it looks like you are recreating session each time you want to send something. Have you tried to store it in a property? 
I did not understood that.. I am starting network request, which uses background session. I call this request every time I need to call it. after I get data, I finish this request. I only need to get a response from a simple request if app goes to background and returns
It is a bad practice to recreate URLSession every time you send a new request, especially with a background configuration. You should store it in your class property. 
It has been more than a year and a half since 4.0. We've all known 5.0 has been a long time coming, plus there are little-to-no breaking changes in 5.0, so what's the problem? This release is huge for the future of the language. The Swift dev community should celebrate it, not bemoan it.
Thank you! I'll be sure to check out that repo. I myself got a bit confused when looking at the sample code lol.
I will post full code
Did you mean I need to create a single URLSession? And only use it for multiple request am I right?
Wouldn’t you use the LaunchScreen storyboard for this? 
How can I set it up with XCode?
FYI, here's the talk Abstract Let's get down to bits and bytes! Abstraction is great, but sometimes it's useful to dig down. In this session, we'll explore exactly how Swift lays out data in memory, including both your own variables and Swift's internal data structures. We'll build a program to recursively scan memory at runtime to dump out everything we want to know, then walk through its results and what they mean, and compare and contrast with how C and C++ store their data.
Yes, you are right. Don't recreate the session for each task. And also store the session id somewhere. In case your app gets killed by the system, the background tasks you have scheduled are still alive in a separate process. So later on your next app launch, you can recreate the session with the same id and get those tasks' statuses. 
I don't want that behavior so I set manually sessionSendsLaunchEvents to false, so it won't return results . The problem is that this error still exists :( maybe because I am using POST requests.. but error should not exist . Have you encoutered such errors?
Didn’t see the linked post there! You gotta admit the guess wasn’t half bad though 😁
Unless they have an API parsing that data will be difficult. 
If they have an API you can retrieve the JSON from, then yes this will work easily, otherwise you'd have to figure out a way to parse the HTML file and retrieve everything ..which sounds pointless if this is a homework assignment. Like the rules it said, you used the Flickr API; so something similar to that. Look for websites where there's an endpoint specifically for retrieving data stored on their servers
They were specifically talking about workstations. 
We havent done the flickr yet, and he hasn't taught us how to grab data at all so thats why i have these questions. Do you have any recommendations on a topic?
How do i find out if they have an api?
Export the attachments directory from your output. There is an option in xcode to delete screenshots for successful tests that defaults to true(that's why xcode server also only gives you the failed screenshots).
Usually they’d have a link, I did not find one in my (short) search. The HTML is parsable, but in general it is more brittle 
here you go: [https://medium.com/@jamesrochabrun/parsing-json-response-and-save-it-in-coredata-step-by-step-fb58fc6ce16f](https://medium.com/@jamesrochabrun/parsing-json-response-and-save-it-in-coredata-step-by-step-fb58fc6ce16f)
It's largely more additive now, the number of changes that a source breaking are fewer and far between. This website provides a pretty good history of the changes from 1.1 to 5.0: [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/84/what-s-new-in-swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/84/what-s-new-in-swift)
Btw Cyberbeni, thank you so much for helping me answer the other question. I was finally able to parallelize Test bundles without having to bloat the project with schemes. So thank you again! If i have time I will write an article, and credit you. Secondly, where can i learn more about this? I've tried typing in "attachments directory travisCI ioS" in google and haven't gotten anything about that. 
I was just learning Swift 4.2 via a Udemy course FML lol. 
xcodebuild has a -resultBundlePath option, somewhere inside will be an Attachments directory. Or you could export the whole stuff. &amp;#x200B; For exporting, travis recommends Amazon S3 but you could use any script/tool that uploads the result somewhere. [https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/)
Would this be alright for what im trying to do? https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs I will just have to switch to using that pet website, but is that what im looking for ?
Never mind, I found it: [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode\_Overview/AlternativeToolchains.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/AlternativeToolchains.html)
What do you mean? Mac minis are new, iMac Pros are new, iMac's just got refreshed. So the Mac Pro? You need that for Xcode development? Cause I don't, and I work on two very large, very widely used iOS Apps. I use a Mac mini (late 2018) and it works fine. It also blows the 2013 Mac Pro out of the water. So what's his point? Because it's certainly gotten better since 2013 on all desktop fronts. (Even laptop as well)
&gt; What do you mean? Workstations. Mac Minis, iMac Pros, and iMacs are not Workstation computers. &gt;So the Mac Pro? That would be what they seem to be talking about. &gt;You need that for Xcode development? Nobody said that. They probably have other reasons they need one. &gt;So what's his point? That workstation class hardware has not been improved/upgraded since 2013. 
Learning swift 4 right now. With the angela yu Udem course. Will it be a problem? 
It's not super different, 99% of what you're learning will still be applicable
i also want to know the answer, i just started to learning with Angela Yu, but is there really huge difference in beginner level? 
Doing with wenderlich course. Looks fine 
No they are very very similar. Also if you write swift 4 syntax, you'll get a nice error saying would you like to convert to swift 5. Keep going.
You are fine. The language is like 99% the same. 
But is Playgrounds working any better? Haven’t tried yet. 
Perhaps you should read up *why* this is not part of Foundation. Hint: It’s not a problem The Swift Core team could not solve. 
Perhaps you should try your hand at Java. That might be more your speed. 
Now is the perfect time to adopt swift now that ABI stability is achieved
You made this post without even reading the minuscule changes made in 5 didn't you. Stop whining, the only constant about software development is that you'll always have to learn new things
What is the problem you are trying to solve? It would be easier to help if you also told us your problem instead of just your proposed solution.
Yes. There are improvements to Playgrounds stability in Xcode 10.2. 
Thanks 
You're probably just going to want to have a Protocol define the important members of the struct, and use that instead. 
&gt; This proposal removes four customization points from protocols in the standard library: &gt; &gt; `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` from `Sequence` &gt; `first`, `prefix(upTo:)`, `prefix(through:)`, and `suffix(from:)` from `Collection` &gt; `last` on `BidirectionalCollection` One of us doesn't know what the word "four" means.
FYL indeed. Might as well give up and start learning Perl 6 now.
Nope, I did not. I even doubt if those logs you've provided are related to your problem, those might be just system logs. 
Binary frameworks aren't expected to be compatible between versions of the compiler prior to module stability.
I have reverted to URLSession which would start requests only in foreground using notification center to determine that. We have changed the configuration to this:
You are working too fast. Watch more memes.
Moderately off topic, but any opinions on how the job market is for iOS devs in the Tampa area, and suggestions for good companies to work at and/or avoid?
I'm having trouble extracting a random item from an array and then accessing its properties. As soon as I create a var to capture the random element, the playground pane displays the properties under the new var name. [randomResult](https://randomResult.name) shows it inherited the properties (in the playground pane) but [randomResult.name](https://randomResult.name) generates an error. Can someone explain to me what I am missing? **let** example1 = (numy: "1", name: "one", sample: "solo") **let** example2 = (numy: "2", name: "two", sample: "pair") **let** example3 = (numy: "3", name: "three", sample: "trio") **let** example4 = (numy: "4", name: "four", sample: "seasons") example.name example2.numy **let** tempArray = \[example1, example2, example3, example4\] **let** randomResult = tempArray.randomElement() randomResult randomResult.name
So what should I do to generate old version with newest xcode? Is it posble
Thank you for the response/ info, that’s awesome to know. And of course I’m not going to give up haha.
Can’t go wrong: 6 &gt; 5
In the meantime, you’ll need to create an objective-c wrapper around your Swift framework’s public API. Details here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/instabug.com/blog/swift-5-module-stability-workaround-for-binary-frameworks/amp/
I read the article, and there are no details of how can I create such wrapper.. how should I change our code structure and etc. Which classes should become public, how to generate custom headers and etc... 
Well, it’s does have a leading {
Well the navigational models are completely different. &amp;#x200B; Say you had an action or a view which needs to appear after another view. In this case you would probably use the navigation controller. &amp;#x200B; Say you had two actions you could do in parallel and the order of them wouldn't matter and they would be independent. Then you would use a tab bar.
5 is source compatible with 4.2 so you're good to go 👌 
The Json api is exactly what you’re looking for
Imagine using an app like the iPhone’s Settings app with a UITabBarController instead of a UINavigationController. Hint : you’ll never have enough room to fit all the items in the UITabBar and you’ll have no sense of hierarchy whatsoever. The two serve really different purposes. 
Ohhhhhh
Looks like SavannaKit.framework doesn't have an expected symbol. Maybe check for an update?
I just updated my project and no changes were required at all. So, it's not exactly a big change here.
Tab bar goes to completely different screens. A navigation goes through a journey of screens from the main one. Imagine a bank app like Citibank which uses a tab bar. If it was all in a navigation, that means you would have to shove ALL possible routes into a single screen. Completely cluttered and ugly. 
Gotta admit, you had me in the first half.
need any help?
Unfortunately no updates in a while — the developer joined Apple. However, it doesn’t give me any compile errors that I could try to fix myself... it just never finishes building.
No issues here, updated Xcode, updated project, cleaned and built. Perhaps post what *specific* errors you had instead of being snarky?
Did you search for that symbol? Looks like he joined Apple in June.
His article/playgrounds were even referenced in the first paragraph of the Swift 5 official announcement at [https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-released/](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-released/). So I'd be fairly comfortable that Apple are delighted with /u/twostraws valuable contributions.
And?
I guess my advice would in general be: don’t wait for something in technology to reach stability before you try to learn it. You have far more opportunity to grow and become a thought leader in early stages than if you wait and learn it when every question you might have has a stack overflow result. You can have a fine career as a contributor if you go with the latter, but the people who can learn quickly and assess oncoming changes effectively are the ones that are more valuable.
What I recommend is [100 Days Of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). In order to obtain a better learning experience, you can combine this course with The Swift Programming book by Apple.

The symbol in question is a Swift runtime symbol. It could be that it isn't linked to the same version of the Swift runtime. I imagine that the dependency is not built with Swift Version 5.
There aren’t really any things that are being removed at this point, it’s just new things being added. 
If you're using Carthage, or otherwise precompiling your dependencies, you need to update and rebuild them all with the same version of the compiler.
I'm pretty sure you can but could you be more specific what you want to do? Give a use case, a workflow, an example?
I am trying to parse this page - [https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781781100486](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781781100486) I need to gather the title and thumbnail somehow but have no idea how to capture the data since its not normal HTML
That's not html. It's JSON. You can use Swift's JSON decoder to access data within it
Swift doesn’t currently have the reflection capabilities necessary to do this
If you're not on macOS 10.14.4 you need to install the [Swift runtime](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Swift_5_Runtime_Support_for_Command_Line_Tools/Swift_5_Runtime_Support_for_Command_Line_Tools.dmg) &gt; Starting with Xcode 10.2, Swift 5 command line programs you build require the Swift 5 runtime support libraries built into macOS. These libraries are included in the OS starting with macOS Mojave 10.14.4. When running on earlier versions of macOS, this package must be installed to provide the necessary Swift 5 libraries. This package is not necessary for apps with graphical user interfaces.
I did that. I hoped it would fix the problem, but sadly it didn’t. Then I noticed that 10.14.4 had been released, updated to it, and am still having the same problem.
Ah, darn :( How is SavannaKit being compiled? Is the source part of your project or are you using a dependency manager like Carthage?
It's not HTML at all, it's [JSON](https://www.json.org). The easiest way to parse it is to use [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) and [`JSONDecoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder). A site like [quicktype](https://quicktype.io) can help you generate a model to use for the decoder. Here's an example, I abbreviated everything to just the data fields you specified: // abbreviated models struct Book: Codable { let kind: String let totalItems: Int let items: [Item] } struct Item: Codable { let volumeInfo: VolumeInfo } struct VolumeInfo: Codable { let title: String let imageLinks: ImageLinks } struct ImageLinks: Codable { let smallThumbnail, thumbnail: String } // abbreviated JSON let json = """ { "kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 1, "items": [ { "volumeInfo": { "title": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "imageLinks": { "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" }, } } ] } """ // decoding import Foundation if let data = json.data(using: .utf8), let book = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Book.self, from: data) { print(book) } // Book(kind: "books#volumes", totalItems: 1, items: [Item(volumeInfo: VolumeInfo(title: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone", imageLinks: ImageLinks(smallThumbnail: "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api", thumbnail: "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api")))]) 
**Module compiled with Swift 5.0 cannot be imported by the Swift 4.2.1 compiler** Hello, this is really strange issue.. We have build our binary framework with swift 4.2. Today, we have successfully changed to swift 5.0, so that users, **who update Xcode** could still use our framework **successfully**( I know, no module stability is a serious problem, and I can't understand why it is less important than ABI). The problem occurred unexpectedly. Why developers, who **had not updated** their Xcode could not use our framework? Isn't it a case, that newer version of Swift can be integrated into projects with old versions? Because it did worked like that earlier. What should we do? How long users can keep old Xcode? Will Apple force to update developers? And most importantly, when will Swift 5.1 will be released? Will it be soon, like 1-2 months? It seems not a huge change from Swift 5.0 At least what should I do to generate old version with newest xcode? Is it possible?
Try downloading the toolchain from here: [https://swift.org/download/#releases](https://swift.org/download/#releases) Once installed you can select the 5.0 Swift Open Source toolchain in Xcode. Not sure what all is missing; probably just things like source migration.
Sorry, I'm still new to swift, but what exactly does that mean?
You can select this, but read installation guide. You have to do so many workarounds to use it in CI and even after that I'm barely sure this will work. Did you try this yourself?
This was extremely helpful, thank you. If you can help me, I'm able to pull the data I need but how do I convert it into String format for manipulation?
&gt; http://hackingwithswift.com/test/rearrange-the-lines/ This is my favorite. Like seriously really really good. Sometimes i'm just to lazy to write the code but having it written and rearranging lines, I love. It makes sure a person understands the syntax and logical steps of the program. 10/10 I would seriously love it if interviews were like this or if code were taught and given during exams like this.
&gt;Swift 5 has been released I can this about it like that, but I can also move to developing for Androids instead :)
You're totally right, I remember when they did the same at around 2009 when I basically had to replace my white mac book. 
I guess it means that code the works in 4.2 also works in 5. 
How do people handle the "Switch covers known cases, but 'Enum' may have additional unknown values, possibly added in future versions" I'm not a fan of default and always want to handle the cases individually, so this warning annoys me.
Been wanting to try Server-side Swift for a while now, maybe I'll give it a try.
Is it worth it compared to the more settled backends?
I hope you do! It's great to be able to use Swift when writing code on the server and very easy to get started with Vapor!
I hope some one else has a better view on this but I am not sure if you should use for a big production services. I really like playing around with Vapor but I haven't really shipped anything with it.
It converts some value into a byte array. For example, if the generic type is an `Int32`, it'll create a byte array holding four bytes; it's the same binary data but represented it as a byte array. It's generic so it can be used with any value type.
To answer your question directly: Store what you want to display in some variable. Set that variable in the IBAction, then reload the table view. In the table view's data source methods, check the variable and return the row count and cells you want to see. BUT: You may not need a table view at all. Have you thought about just putting your three views into a UIStackView? If you do that, you can just set the views you don't want to see to hidden, and you're done.
You can't modify the way some other app launches, iOS doesn't allow that. What you can do is have your own app launch the other app after that delay. You can always bypass that by opening the other app directly, though.
Read the error. It even offers you a fix to get rid of the error. The reason for the error is that `randomElement` can't return an element when the array is empty, so it has to return an optional (so that it can return nil if the array is empty). But that optional doesn't have a name property, you have to unwrap it first, using `if let` or optional changing: `randomResult?.name`. (The latter one of the quick fix options Xcode gives you).
I’m running a Kitura app for my apps backend and so far it’s been great. I went with Kitura for a specific reason (better cache expiry control out of the box), but also found the syntax a lot less confusing. Vapor has a heavy emphasis on Promises and Futures and feels very functional with lots of maps and flat maps. Kitura is a lot more straightforward and I found it a lot easier to write code I could reason about. YMMV
You don't need to convert anything, it's all in the properties of the model objects: import Foundation if let data = json.data(using: .utf8), let book = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Book.self, from: data), let first = book.items.first { print(first.volumeInfo.title) // "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" } 
Thanks for the reply Rennarda! &amp;#x200B; True, basically all the routes returns a Future with Vapor. But I actually like working with them, you can do a lot with less lines of code. I try to make my code more functional so that is one of the reasons I really like Vapor. &amp;#x200B; I think Kitura is also a great choice and it is good to hear you have running backend for your app implemented with it!
Thought I had tried that, but clearly I had not. Thank you!
I think the best route would be an SKAction class func moveBy(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, duration: TimeInterval) You’d can check out more on this at: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/skaction/1417739-move
Wish there was a transcript of some kind. This kind of review really shouldn't take nearly 2 hours, it's more like a 10-minute read.
Thank you for you feedback, have you ever used this method? I assume to simulate a real jump you would want it to accelerate and decelerate?
Same. Zero issues. 
unknown default is nice. It shouldn't act as a traditional default so you still get safe enums. Unknown default just handles the VERY real case where the OS/external library adds a new case independent of your app, and now if that case gets sent to a switch your old app that was compiled without being aware of that case will RUNTIME CRASH which we never want.
I don't personally know JSQMessages, but given what your instructor says, it sounds like it is a fairly stable project that's no longer maintained. In that case, I'd go with it. You have some risk that things no longer work due to updates in Xcode or iOS, but in that case you can either fix those issues yourself, or use an older Xcode version to build your app. Once you have a working app, it's unlikely that anything will completely break it later on. 
yes
It's not, the patch notes just forgot to mention it for OS X. [Source.](https://forums.swift.org/t/command-line-applications-crashes-with-xcode-10-2/22192/2)
Not sure I understand the question, do you want to hold a reference to a VC or just out the view of a VC into a cell?
Working with SceneKit to render 3D models of organic molecules. 
`photoView = data.value(forKey:"binary") as? UIImageView` That type coercion will not work. You need to [convert the NSData back into an image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/1624137-imagewithdata) first and then load it into a newly created `UIImageView`, not cast the image data into a view. &amp;#x200B; Also, when working with CoreData objects, you typically use concrete subclasses with exposed properties rather than raw `NSManagedObjects` instances with key paths. That gives you type checking, among other advantages. Is there a reason you aren't doing that here?
Thanks for the help, I'll try and implement that. Any idea why that line wouldn't throw an error if it would not work?
It doesn't throw an error because the compiler can't know that it's impossible. [value(forKey:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobject/1506613-value) returns `Any?` so the compiler cannot predict that the casting won't work; it will always fail at runtime, though, but that's up to you to catch. That's one of the big reasons why you'd want the type checking that subclassing NSManagedObject provides.
Ahh yeah that's makes sense, I didn't think about that. Thank you!
Hold a ref. Like a vc has containers of other vcs
Did you try changing the audiosession? It should ensure playing in the background.
Sure. In your cellforrowat, instantiate a subclass of your desired uitableviewcontroller (e.g. let x = YourTableViewController()). 
Had a few issues but figured it out. Just read the errors and you’ll figure it out. Note: i’m a total noob and have zero coding experience other than what i’ve taught myself these past couple months. 
Modules have never been compatible between compiler versions, which is why everyone was holding off on shipping precompiled Swift frameworks. You'll need to offer separate compiled versions for the different compiled versions, or offer a version that can be built from source.
Too bad he won't be giving talks anymore, given he works for Apple now.
You'll need to offer separate versions of your framework for different versions of the compiler, or offer source builds.
yes, we will offer separate versions.. it is a private framework. Also maybe you know about frameworks and using optional frameworks? I have asked many senior devs, but received only more support, without real answers.. here is our problem in a nutshell: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55077857/if-canimport-does-not-find-frameworks-with-cocoapods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55077857/if-canimport-does-not-find-frameworks-with-cocoapods)
Well, I don’t consider my question to a proposed solution to some greater problem, but to be the actual problem I’m trying to solve: I want to list the members of a struct without having an instance of it (as when using mirror), but rather by referring to it’s type. In this case I’m not looking for a “could you structure your code like this instead” kind of answer, but rather a simple “yes, do this” one. If you know such an answer I think it would actually be very easy to help 😉 
Thanks! If you have a link or something to share on the subject I would be ever so grateful.
The thing is I’m working with generic objects, so I would just like to be able to get passed any type and get it’s members. Since I’m dealing with generic objects I can’t instantiate them and pass them along to Mirror (or not that I know of, at least).
Typically you shouldn't be storing binary data directly to a SQL database. You should simply save the filename and fetch the file from disk.
Yeah I've seen people mentioning this online. Do you mean the disk of the computer I'm working on or the simulator storage? Saving the binary is literally just for demonstration purposes for an assignment, it's not for an actual app that will be developed further
It may be empty when the value is checked but has data after the network call is completed. 
I hope that all unifies once we get async/await support in the language.
what is the best way to handle a situation like this?
You should return theData so it exits the scope or declare a local variable and fill it there.
nvm just fixed it! added this code in a certain spot while self.theData.count == 0{ //do nothing }
I still don’t understand the end result like, do you wanna show that VC in the cell? Either way I would have an existing array of VCs on your controller and pass them in via your cell model
And it as a view of the cell?
So make the array of vcs as part of building your model unless it’s generic and can be configured with your model then just init the CV inside the cell or something, or if your entire table is made up of putting vc.view into a cell consider using a stackview in a scroll view and put the vc. View in there
I guess we'd have to know more about the actual problem you're trying to solve.
Hmm a stackview in a scroll is an interesting idea. What the advantage of doing this? Tnx
The colon indicates a parameter, the underscore is used when the name is omitted. So the method takes a parameter without a name. 
It's a method that takes a single parameter and the parameter name is omitted. Each colon, ":", is another parameter in the method and the underscore, "_", before it means that the name is omitted when you call it. So you call it like: `success(foo)` 
It’s just an easier alternative if the vcs are static really like you gonna have a header vc, body vc, and so on... I use it for things like expandable lists as it’s much easier to just jade/show internal stackviews for showing and hiding things
That isn't a good solution, it's possibly going to max a cpu core on the users device which is terrible for battery life. If the network request ever fails or is cancled, that loop will never stop. &amp;#x200B; Instead of having your code go "Is it ready yet? How about now? How about now? How about now? How about now?" forever, have your network request tell the other part of your code when it's finished.
oh wow! thank you for telling me. I'll try this now.
I see. Thank you
Yes, the disk of the computer/phone, in this case they are the same thing since using the simulator will store the file to the Mac SSD. NSData has a `write` function where you provide a destination URL that you create. Save that URL to the CoreData. You can then fetch that saved data via the `init` with URL in the NSData class.
Alright, what information are you missing?
Can you go over secure login?! Love this article and have messed with Vapor and Kitura before but I always get hung up on secure login.
question from someone who took two intro programming classes: when do you use this?
Short answer: it's fine, you're not going to copy any data here Long answer: CVPixelBuffer is a class, so "copying" it in this case is just copying (and retaining) the reference to it. The only case where a situation like this would cause the actual data to be copied is when: * You have a pass-by-value (enum or struct) type * Which doesn't do copy-on-write (so not Array/Dictionary/Set/String and so on) * And the optimizer doesn't manage to prove to itself that it's safe to eliminate the copy Note that for reference types (classes), the equivalent situation to not optimizing out the copy is failing to eliminate a retain-release pair, which has its own performance cost.

How do I know which type foo must have?
Thanks! How do I know which type foo must have?
Look into completion handlers if you’re not familiar with them. 
For a while if I closed the computer and put it to sleep and open project would be hosed at wake up. Lost track of files until a relaunch. Stopped happening all of a sudden. My only complaint so far...
How do I view text files saved from my program on iOS (v12.1.1)? I tried [this tutorial](https://www.appcoda.com/files-app-integration/), but looks like Files has changed since then, all that shows up in there is the Playgrounds app. I am writing a test file, and can see it on the computer in /Library/... using: let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask) let filename = paths[0].appendingPathComponent("test_of_file.txt") let str = "test string" do { try str.write(to: filename, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8) } catch { print("Error writing to file.") } &amp;#x200B;
That should be in the documentation, it is not stored in the signature.
Thanks
Private imports are not well supported currently. Since you do have a framework, you should be able to use a framework\_private.modulemap to split out part of the framework as a private implementation which would not propagate through. Alternatively, if you do not need any of it in Swift, you can setup the modulemap to just drop the headers which declare the interfaces that are "private" from the module definition.
1. try to create an Integer from the input and catch the error or 2. use a regex to check whether it's an integer. 
So I am using Foundation to convert to an int. guess = (guessField.text! as NSString).integerValue When I put in a string there is no error, I think it somehow turns the char into an int value.
Int(string: guessField.text) should do the job. 
Let's say you have an iOS application that stores todo lists. If you want to be able to access those todo lists on another device you would need to store them somewhere. So you have a database on a server somewhere. But in order to guarantee that the right person only have access to their todo lists you need some sort of service who acts as a security guard between the user and the database. This is what a backend service is for. And frameworks like Vapor or Kitura mentioned in this post makes it easier to get started with writing a backend service.
If you're using a storyboard, you can actually set the text filters there so you'll never get invalid input. However, Int(string: "123afq") will throw an exception, so try/catch for that.
I noticedupgrade with autocompletion, especially with generic type aliases when previous version returned &lt;error type&gt;. On the other hand I have a weird bug that Xcode shows me that my Giles has been changed in source control view, but there is no changes.
Like I mentioned in our other post - use a completion handler. Once the data arrives, the handler will fire and you can have the result be a refresh of the table view.
You should have the cells update asynchronously. I'm assuming that each cell needs to make a call and that you can't do a single call from your view controller. In that case, I would suggest you have your network logic in a separate class, and have it return the data in a completion handler. Perhaps something like the following: ``` class SomeService { static func call(withParameter parameter: String, completionHandler: @escaping (_ data: YourDataObject?) -&gt; Void) { // Do your network stuff // When that's done, then decode your object // Pass your decoded object to the completion handler completionHandler(decodedObject) } } ``` And then your cell can call that method: ``` SomeService.call(forParameter: "WhateverYourParameterIs") { data in guard let data = data else { print("No decoded data") return } // Configure your cell for the data } ``` No while loop. You can add some UI so people know the cell is loading. Perhaps have a UIActivityIndicatorView on each cell as it's loading and dismiss it when your handler is called.
Yeah you're right a completion handler is the way to go. I'm having an issue where I can't get a relevant example to learn from with a JSONdecoder(). Do you happen to have any additional info? This would be my first real experience with a completion handler.
From your link to the documentation: &gt; ###`Declaration` &gt; `case success(Success)` So the type is `Success`. 
Yup, this is a result of having multiple incompatibles Swift runtime in your project. 
It’s a symbol from the Swift runtime. 
These helped me but there are plenty more. https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io/completion-handlers-in-swift-with-bob-6a2a1a854dc4 https://medium.com/@nimjea/completion-handler-in-swift-4-2-671f12d33178 https://grokswift.com/completion-handler-faqs/

trying to convert a string to an integer with Int(yourString) will return an Int?, if it's nil you'll know that the input was not an integer

Did you hit the "Fix" button?
Does the Card class requires an identifier parameter?
How would I figure that out. Sorry I’m new here 
Do what they say below and hit the fix button.
It’s referencing a structure named card with no parameters 
Replace the '\_' in line 23 with a named parameter like index or something. And then replace line 24 with : \`let card = Card(identifier: index)\`
Thanks so much for ur help . Do u know why that was happening so I don’t do it again?
It worked btw. Thx
Stanford course? It’s really good. Stick with it
Card has parameters in its constructor.
Yea the iOS 11 one. My god he moves fast it’s daunting keeping everything in order. How was it for u?
It looks like when a card is created it takes an argument called “identity”. This is prob used to know when two of the same cards have been selected (I’m assuming this is a memory card game). When the new instance of card is being created, it must be passed an “identity”. This is the case because when created the “Card” class/struct, you only created initialization methods that take arguments.
I took it a while back but I had programming experience going into it. It’s a really good course but it’s assumed you have experience and aren’t new to programming completely. Have you done any programming before or this is your first course?
After you get the data, you could setup a delegate to refresh your view and populate whatever your using that data with? Look up Delegate Patterns in Swift. 
Yea some python, HTML css but nothing like this it’s a big step up. A challenge I’ve been seeking for a long time!
Swift does have modules and you don’t even need to import anything since the Dictionary type is part of the standard library :)
Think he meant oxford/Webster style dictionary. 😉
A previous version of my game (Minute Speller) had this feature. I removed it because it seemed like it was unnecessary. Are you looking for a standard app to do this or for this feature and more?
Hahaha in that case, you weren't too far off 😜
Yeah, realized that much later when the coffee kicked in. I was really exhausted this morning.
I noticed that the build-time analysis has gotten a lot more clever. The new compiler detected a bug (misuse of an api) in the version of Reachability.m that I've been using for the last 10 years.
In that case: [NSHipster: Dictionary Services](https://nshipster.com/dictionary-services/)
I’d say just be sure and take your time. If you have a problem understanding something don’t be afraid to pause and read a little about it. Apple has really good documentation too. If you get stuck let me know and I can try to help. I may even have the code somewhere
Still waiting for zoom in storyboards for macOS...
In the earliest versions of “iPhoneOS”, if I recall correctly, linking wasn’t technically dynamic. That happened later on. 
the most technically correct solution i can think of is `text?.unicodeScalars.allSatisfy(CharacterSet.decimalDigits.contains) ?? false` What this does is it accesses the underlying unicode values of the string, then it checks that they are all contained within the decimal digits CharacterSet. 
Oh I see, thanks again!
I know you fixed it but maybe looking at where card is defined would help. You can command click it and jump to it's definition.
Just released a Swift rewrite of my app Countr. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/countr-quick-count/id911664683?mt=8 After this, going to be working in a 2.1 release, as well as going back into my Github repos and working on refreshing something I had made 2 years ago. https://github.com/JoshHrach/Provincial
the word's* definition words = more than one word Possessive nouns! How do they work?!
It may be thanks to “app thinning”, which I think was just released. It results in smaller builds of your app, so it makes sense that builds would be quicker and with less resource consumption. 
Write it like this: `Card(identifier: yourValue)`. Also, lines 16-20 can be written as: `cards[index].isFaceUp = !cards[index].isFaceUp` or even simpler: `cards[index].isFaceUp.toggle()`.
I see no `Int(string:)` [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int). Where are you finding this?
guard let anInt = Int(textfield.text) else { print(“input a number”); return }
Thanks lunarchaos :) Good idea! I already started working with my next blog topic, but I'll definetly add secure login to my blog topic list.
This. Plus, Swift has copy-on-write (COW) semantics which means that even if something is copied in your code, under the hood the actual cost of copying the data is not incurred until that copied data is mutated/written, because Swift tracks the data and can tell when it would be changed and then copies it just before it’s changed. So you can copy stuff all day long and if the data isn’t mutated you never would incur the cost of copying that data.
Thanks, very helpfull
I have a similar issue ([https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/b67fbc/xcode\_102\_release\_builds\_frozen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/b67fbc/xcode_102_release_builds_frozen/)) and I tried moving all of my Carthage dependencies to Cocoapods and it didn't help. Unfortunately I have some pre-built frameworks even from Cocoapods, so maybe there are old symbols in their causing me problems. I'm really struggling to find the cause of this problem...
App thinning has been around for years and it "thins" resources, not compiled code.
I never was a fan of storyboards and segues and this code is another example of "how not to" when it comes to passing data between view-controllers. 
You’re welcome. Glad to help!
It sounds like you're looking for something like pip for swift? Swift in itself does not come with ready-to-use modules. There are third party tools such as cocoapods that can help you add external modules to your project. (I'm assuming that this is an xcode app). 
App thinning also takes place on the App Store server. It strips compiled code and resources not needed for the device that’s installing the app.
Hello, &amp;#x200B; Yesterday I faced the same problem, I spent my day trying to figure out why does this build freeze happens and in the evening I discovered that some file where missing in my project (for an unrelated reason) but where still in the pbxproj. And xcode instead of stopping with an error like it did before was apparently trying hard to find the missing files in the directory. &amp;#x200B; I hope my lost day can help someone.
CoW is a feature of specific Swift types like Array, String, and so on. It’s not automatic, and it’s not without its own costs, so you wouldn’t really want it to be automatic in many cases.
Can you explain what it is you are doing in a background thread? Maybe a code sample?
Hm, this is quite unexpected for me, but I really appreciate the honest feedback! I feel that a lot of brackets for nesting are required by the language and you can almost always avoid nesting by creating intermediate constants. Would you say that splitting that expression into intermediate constants helps? How big of a problem are nested brackets and parenthesis here for you in general compared to other possible issues? 
self.tabBarController?.tabBar.isHidden = true
Please wrap your code in a code block. Either by highlighting it and clicking the \`&lt;/&gt;\` button, or if using a markdown editor using \`\\\`\\\`\\\`\` around it.
A is not a final class, so your function won't alwas return Self
Isn’t anything that is Self, or a subclass, a Self? Or did Swift screw this up? That’s the whole point of classes... 
I'm not quite positive what you're trying to do, but you can use associated types to do something that looks like what I think you're trying to do. protocol Pro { associatedtype SelfType func foo() -&gt; SelfType init() } class A: Pro { typealias SelfType = A func foo() -&gt; SelfType { return A() } func p() { print("I am A") } required init() {} } class B: Pro { typealias SelfType = B func foo() -&gt; SelfType { return B() } func q() { print("I am B") } required init() {} } Then you can do: let a = A() let b = B() let c = a.foo() let d = b.foo() a.p() // prints "I am A" b.q() // prints "I am B" c.p() // prints "I am A" d.q() // prints "I am B"
I don't mean that. Self is a special type. I was saying is I can return Self in swift 5.
Ah. Got it. How about this: protocol Pro { init() func foo() -&gt; Self } class A: Pro { required init() {} func foo() -&gt; Self { let f = type(of: self).init() return f } } class B: A { required init() {} override func foo() -&gt; Self { let f = type(of: self).init() return f } } let a = A() let z = a.foo() let b = B() let y = b.foo() 
your code works. so, i have to use type(of: self) to get the \`type\` back?
You can do this, you just need to think how you access initialiser. For example, you can do something like this: protocol Pro { init() func foo() -&gt; Self } class A: Pro { required init(){} func foo() -&gt; Self { return generate() } func b() { print(type(of: self)) } func generate&lt;T: Pro&gt;() -&gt; T { return T() } } class B: A {} let a = A() let b = B() a.foo().b() // prints 'A' b.foo().b() // prints 'B'
This is not something new: https://twitter.com/_danielhall/status/737782965116141568 The problem is the non-`final` class and the way methods are dispatched on it. In a `final` class you could just do: final class A: Pro { required init(){} func foo() -&gt; A { return A() } } In a non-`final` class you would need to do this as an extension: extension Pro where Self: A { func foo() -&gt; Self { return Self() } }

That was interesting to read through since it’s Linux-specific. Hope they get it fixed instead of having to re-write with different tools. 
yes, it is not new. but your code will get error in swift 5.
nice work. it would be cool to have gifs of the different animations in the repo
There is , is'nt? I've put all different animations in a single gif like this one in the readme, maybe it didn't load cause some browser issues or internet problems
Yeah but you would return a superclass. You can also make the function `required`
The problem is with: let currentcurrentUrl = URLRequest(url: currentUrl!) UserDefaults.standard.set(currentcurrentUrl, forKey: "Link") currentcurrentUrl (terrible name for a variable by the way) is a URLRequest. You can’t store such an object in UserDefaults. Check the UserDefaults documentation for supported types. You need to store a String representation of the url in UserDefaults instead. A quick word of warning: apps which are just a web view container of a website and provide no additional functionality are against the App Store Guidelines and are likely to be rejected.

Thank you ❤️
If your IAPs are unlocks of new levels and/or essential for having the complete experience of the game, I would wait and see what apple arcade has to offer. If they allow any developer to submit games to it (which as far as I know is the case) it should be a good way to market and monetize your game. On the other hand, if your IAPs are centered around a premium currency that gives you little boosts during gameplay, I would release it as soon as it is ready and continue it’s development cycle as normal. It’s a hard time for IAP centered games, as we still have a lot to learn about Apple Arcade, but I hope that both models can co-exist and be a viable business model.
Different clientele. There will always be a market for small/solo devs. The arcade will draw a lot of people in, but it won’t have an abundance of games for every style/genre of game. So even those who have arcade will still go to the App Store to find something different every so often. Then there are those who won’t/can’t pay for a subscription based service. They will always be looking for their next game. And some people would rather buy the one or two games they want, or make a few in game purchases, than the subscription. So just keep developing, make your game as awesome as possible, and have great success. 
Thanks for your response (agreed, will rename them hah). Sorry, I'm a beginner so not sure about all the terminology. Thanks for the warning, will think about it. Have a look at my follow up questions below: &amp;#x200B; let currentUrl = webView.url // prints: Optional(https://www.mydomain.com/) let currentcurrentUrl = URLRequest(url: currentUrl!) // prints: https://www.mydomain.com/ //as below line of code works, why does not URLRequest work? I thought it made an optional into a regular URL? (String?) - Is there another code I can use to transform an optional to a String Representation? UserDefaults.standard.set("https://www.mydomain.com", forKey: "Link") &amp;#x200B;
It's not as much of a problem for me. I am more talking about things from a sellers perspective, yours. People see the API they might be wary of something like this if it looks a bit "heavy". That is because, from the point of view of the client, the developer, using a UI framework is a huge investment and risk going forward, so the first impression is very important because they are already probably very scared. Then if they want to go with the framework, they will probably have to tell their coworkers about it and then some of them might not be too happy with it and they end up not using it. This stuff is all psychological basically :)
It looks like you removed the `averagePaceLabel` IBOutlet from one of your view controllers, but forgot to disconnect the outlet in InterfaceBuilder. Go into the storyboard for that view controller, right click on the VC object and clear the connection for `averagePaceLabel`.
So I removed averagePaceLabel from the IBOutlet and checked in main.storyboard that there was no outlet. Ran the code and it’s giving me the same error but for the distanceLabel now. I have no clue what’s going wrong. I’ve only linked my labels up once to my StartRunViewController, I’ve named them once via the document section in identity inspector before linking them up and I’ve checked the connections are all still valid. 
&gt; it’s giving me the same error but for the distanceLabel now Open your storyboard in Interface Builder. Select your view controller. On the right hand side of Xcode at the top there is a tab controller to choose between inspectors. Choose the identity inpector. Confirm that your view controller is declared as being a StartRunViewController. If it says UIViewController then you need to change it. Then right click on your view controller in IB and make sure there are no outlets with the yellow triangle outlet on the right side. If there are disconnect them.
So I checked Start Run View Controller in the identity inspector and the class is listed as StartRunViewController. Is that what you mean? Sorry if I’m being dumb. 
Yes.
The class is the same in the interface builder as it is in my StartRunViewController.swift file
“Swift apps no longer include dynamically linked libraries for the Swift standard library and Swift SDK overlays in build variants for devices running iOS 12.2, watchOS 5.2, and tvOS 12.2. As a result, Swift apps can be smaller when they’re shipped in the App Store, deployed for testing using TestFlight, or thinned in an app archive for local development distribution.” Taken directly from the release notes. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_release_notes/swift_5_release_notes_for_xcode_10_2 To correct what I said earlier, and to correct what you said, App Thinning has been out for a while but new features were added to it as part of 10.2 as described above.
&gt; the same error but for the distanceLabel now. Assuming it is the same error, you need spend some time looking through your storyboards for an outdated connection to `distanceLabel`. Either that or you need to be clearer about what the error is. Copy/pasting the stack trace from the console (The line that says "Terminating app due to _whatever_" is the most relevant part) would be helpful.

&gt; Unknown class MainMenuViewController in Interface Builder file &gt; Unknown class StartRunViewController in Interface Builder file Was there a class MainMenuViewController/StartRunViewController that you've renamed or deleted? There's still a reference to it in your storyboard/xib. You need to find it and point it at the newly renamed class/delete is. Another option is that the file that your classes are in are not included in the `target` you're trying to run. You can check that by selecting the file that hold each of those classes and selecting the File Inspector tab in the top right. There's a Target Membership section at the bottom, you can see it in the screenshot you posted. Make sure the Target you have selected in the Run popup on the top left (Where it says "Running Application and Exercise Tracker &gt; Ashley's iPhone" in your screenshot) is selected in the Target Membership section. 
That would return true for such strings as `"१"` -- which would return nil from `Int("१")`. That isn't what was asked for, and it's hard to imagine a case where this would be what you want. &gt; attempting to turn it into an integer might lose you points since attempting to transform the input wasn’t part of the scope. The question literally says "and then converting it to an int". Conversion is half of the problem.
[SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) has been included with Swift since 2016.
Not that I can think of, I checked all the target memberships of all the files and aside from info.plist they’re all attributed to the “Running Application and Exercise Tracker” I haven’t renamed any of my view controllers aside from the original one which I renamed “MainMenuViewController”. I don’t get it. 
URLRequest [encapsulates a load request](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlrequest). Not sure where you got the idea that it unwraps an Optional. [webView.url](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/1415005-url) is a property of type URL. That's a different type than String.
Thx, that’s a really good point! I will try it out once I’m at home 
Remember the party line: - Vapor is young but it's production-ready, - ARC is just as good as tracing GC, and - Swift supports Linux! &gt; On Linux however, it's a much different story. The first request takes the application from 2.9MiB in the System Monitor to 374.2MiB. From what I can tell, that memory is never released. Oops...
`Self` is not an alias of the current type. If you have `class A { func foo() -&gt; Self }`, it implies that if you have a `class B: A`, its `foo()` returns a B, not an A or a different subclass. 
Someone who clearly did not know what he was talking about wrote it on StackOverflow! Just starting to understand the "!" when it comes to optionals. But thank you, this helped - I needed to switch out "webView.url" to "webView.url?.absoluteString", now it is working. Thanks!
GODDAMNIT EVERY TIME WHY CANT I ATTACH IMAGES WITH MY QUESTIONS!!
That’s okay to be a “noob”. I am 100% self taught and worked my way up to actually making quite a bit of spare cash via side gigs. I’d suggest if it is a term like modulus operators, you hit up the Apple documentation. They will tell you exactly what something means and how to use it. With something like modulus operators, even a quick google search could point you in the right direction as it is a term used cross language. The more specific things you’ll want specific use cases targeting the swift language. Don’t be afraid to ask questions on here, r/swift r/Xcode r/iOSProgramming etc, or even somewhere like stack overflow. You’ll figure it out. 
The final iteration in this post is pretty similar to what I landed on with my own client after using a few different frameworks over the years. I wanted something simple and clean that I controlled. 
I was having a bad brain day yesterday, clearly. (Managed to segfault with an int array writing in C without going out of bounds, yay me.) [Int has an optional init that takes a String.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/2927504-init)
I would be inclined to have the background of the button be the gradient and have a white overlay with the text “cut out” of it. In other words, the border and text would be an illusion of the two different layers.
I already have that on my other button
Another question, he wants us to now make a class map naming all the classes and their methods. Would some classes from the api website be included in that? Or those are methods within classes i will be creating?
It sounds like just the classes you are writing since the API is only giving you data
&gt; I just want to learn Swift, quickly. Classic.

Thanks, man. Kudos for being self taught, too, that’s no easy task!
Triple backticks does not work in Reddit. Reddit uses four spaces or one tab before a line.
I thought the pun was well played. 
The tone of my reply was kinda rude, let me edit that :)
Thanks - I had no idea what the OP meant until you cleared that up for me.
Oh, you do not want a creative coder. Creativity is *not* a valuable programer trait. You want a methodical, careful, restrained programmer. Those are the ones who will properly plan out an app infrastructure and be on-time and on-budget with their estimates. Leave the creativity to the artists and salespeople.
Actually sorry but the coding style is called creative coding. You can check out the language processing. It’s very much creative and stylized. They normally aren’t the ones who do the infrastructure they are the artist. 
Ok, so you want a programmer to do creative coding - not a creative programmer. Got it. There's a pretty decent difference in the wording there, one way is ambiguous where the other spells it out.
Did the exact same recently, just got a basic struct that handles using NSURLSession to do an http call to my api which returns a "Codable promise".
An spoken like a true coder:) ok gotcha that makes sense thanks for the clarification 
Good luck with the project!
* Going through the 100 Days of Swift program from u/twostraws. Just finished Day 18 (including the Challenges), so a bit behind. I'm really enjoying it so far. * Building a personal MacOS app to capture software product feature ideas that can then be added to Microsoft Azure DevOps as Work Items via the API. Our company uses the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), and as a Product Manager I have a lot of ideas that I'd like to keep "off the books" as I think through them. But once they are ready to be considered, I'd like to easily add it to the backlog. That's what this tool will do. Probably would be easier as a web app (or even just a spreadsheet), but it's giving me a chance to work with Swift, including bindings and Core Data, even if it's a bit of a hack. Since I'm very new, I'm getting some help from a friend and Stack Exchange.
Teaching yourself may not be easy but mostly it's the only option for programmers. When you reach a certain point you realize there aren't (m)any answers to the questions you have at a given moment and you are left with trial and error experimentation. 
Thank you!!!
You need to get comfortable using multiple sources of knowledge at once and putting together the answers into something actually useful to you. It is gradually more rare to find precisely tailored answers to your questions the more experienced you become. 
This was a well-written post. Gotta say I can't agree more!
Hey all, I have VC which has some view at the top and table view at the bottom, which approach is better: \- create tableViewController with my table view and add this view controller to my main VC \- create table view in my main VC nad adopt the necessary protocols I would be very grateful if you could answer with an explanation. Thanks!
Nice! I hope you enjoy the 100 days 👍
I've heard backticks work on new reddit, but I use old reddit too - which requires four spaces or tab indentation.
map
You could extend Optional to add that, if you wanted. You might not be able to call it let, though. 
Actually we can, just put the name of the function between '', like func 'let', just like above code, above extension would does the job
Right now I’m using Moya and I’ll be honest...I feel like I could do the same thing. The only thing I really like about Moya is how it handles unit tests 
Devils advocate: &gt;APIClient has grown over the course of these examples, but all send and done, it is still less than 100 hundred lines. &gt;Furthermore, this fully-featured system is not reliant on any 3rd party code. Well, if you don't count this blog post as a 3rd party. I mean, Alamofire is open source, you can read and copy that source code too. It's also now unversioned, project specific, has no test coverage or code review, and it will grow as you need to add more use cases. Also, calling it "fully featured" seems like a bit of a stretch. Alamofire isn't 100 lines of networking code and then several hundred lines of useless bloat. If you want fully featured, it's going to be more than this example. Writing your own networking layer has its advantages, but failing to acknowledge the shortcomings isn't really fair. 
Is the nib loaded? Is the delegate non-nil in the method? What did you try? You'd probably get a lot more help if you could provide more information. I don't know how to set up and test a custom keyboard on iOS.
&gt; it will grow as you need to add more use cases Grow in what way? It seems pretty generic.
It is impossible to leave your application’s directory due to sandboxing 
Just split up the problem into a combination of smaller problems until all your problems have a trivial solution.
I got a lot of responses on my previous post so I created a short programming assignment to just let everyone show off their dev chops. PM me if you want to apply and I will send you a link to the doc!
This is already built-in: let foo: Int? = 5 foo.flatMap { print($0) // 5 } 
Swift can be tricky and like @Cyberbeni said, busting it up into pieces helps. For some reason I tend to be \~ sloppy when coding Swift and then refactor once I get the logic figured out. PM if you want to collaborate. 
I'd consider this an abuse of `map`, since it's supposed to be a transform. I do wish we had a non-transforming equivalent.
Want to do certificate pinning? Automatic retry? Dynamically add credentials? Support all types of tasks? Support background modes? Well, 100 lines isn't going to cut it.
It's not an abuse though, it's specifically designed and meant to be used this way. You are transforming a wrapper, `Optional`, into a value and applying the closure. Just like if you use `map` on an `Array`, that is a wrapper around a collection of values. Lots of people use it just like this. Take a look at what some of these renowned authors and programmers have to say: https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-using-map-to-deal-with-optionals/ https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-map-with-an-optional-value https://swiftunboxed.com/lang/optionals-map-flatmap/ http://alisoftware.github.io/swift/2015/10/11/thinking-in-swift-4/
I'm in the same boat. What have you been working on?
It's really not, as you lose the original type. That there are published uses of it like doesn't mean much. I mean, there's a reason other languages have the non-transforming equivalent.
Does his course have a chatroom or something like that, like the Udemy ones do? Those can be really useful for asking the questions you might feel a bit shy asking amongst a more experienced online crowd.
You lose the original type when you use `map` on a `Dictionary` too, does that mean it's also an abuse?
Please use the system built into UIKit, not enough apps do (even Apple ones) https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/preserving_your_app_s_ui_across_launches 
The var/let distinction (which is what the 'mutating' keyword refers to; 'mutating' stuff can only be called on vars) applies to a particular variable or property, rather than a particular instance of a type. For a pass-by-value type, that's the same thing (to the extent that you can say value types have a meaningful concept of instance): if you assign a value to a new variable, then you've made a copy of it, so the old value in the 'let' constant won't be changed when you mutate the 'var'. For a pass-by-reference type though, if you assign it to a new variable, then mutate it (allowed because it's through a var), then you're mutating the original too, since you only copied the reference. TLDR: reference types can change out from under you even if you use let because you can just assign the reference to a var; that makes the whole thing sorta pointless, so it's just not applicable, and since it's not applicable, the related keyword (mutating) is also not applicable.
That’s part of a reference to the success function. If you do `let f = Result.success(_:)` then success isn’t called but instead f becomes, essentially, a function pointer. You can then do `f(x)` to call the original `success` function. If instead the success func was declared `success(value: SomeType)` then that expression would be `Result.success(value:)`. The underscore is a placeholder for an omitted argument label.
This is something I found really interesting. We get some performance benefits in String processing with the arrival of Swift 5 and this going into depth why
You don't seem to understand what I'm saying. ``` let string: String? = "string" let now = string.map { print($0) } ``` Once you `print` `string`, its type becomes `Void?` (or really `()?`), so there's no way to then perform the transforms you want. Essentially, you've lost the original type of the value by printing it, making this usage impossible to integrate into a chain of transforms like you may want. So while you can use `map` like this, it breaks its compatibility.
I'll suggest something even smaller. Why have your own `APIRequest` class when Apple has already provided a perfectly serviceable URLRequest struct? You can install an HTTP method, path, queryItems, headers, body... Everything you need to make a request to the server. All your requests can be expressed in an extension of the URLRequest type: https://github.com/danielt1263/RxMyCoordinator/blob/master/RxMyCoordinator/Requests.swift And they are amazingly easy to test if you feel the need. I'm still happy to use a networking library if I have to send a multi-part form though. That's a pain.
`Void` and `()` are the same. let string: String? = "string" let now = string.map { print($0); return $0 } Now it's non-transforming. It's only `Void?` because you returned nothing and the closure had a default signature of `(Int) throws -&gt; Void`. The same happens with any method that doesn't have a `return` statement.
&gt; Want to do certificate pinning? Nobody does certificate pinning. I have, without libraries, and it's not the end of the world. &gt; Automatic retry? No. It's generally a bad idea. But I've built it in a project, and it's trivial. &gt; Dynamically add credentials? I have no idea what this means, so probably no. &gt; Support all types of tasks? No. I only want to support the tasks my app needs. &gt; Support background modes? Those break with certificate pinning. That's just one idiosyncrasy that can't be abstracted away. &gt; 100 lines isn't going to cut it. The alternative is supporting 9,000 lines of someone else's code. If most of what you've described are imaginary problems, I'll choose the 100 line wrapper. By managing the layer myself, if the day ever comes where I need every one of the features you described, I can just integrate it within my layer since it's all abstracted away.
Gotta agree, retrying when using oauth after you refresh the token is something you’ll eventually write, but you might not manage it as well and you definitely won’t test it as much as Alamofire does. As always it depends on what the job is and what kind of tool you need.
Nice! The Android one could use some tweaks but I love what you're doing! Keep up the good work! 👍🏽
I wrote my own Network layer by referring coding style of Moya. Now I am have more control and confidence about using it than any of third party network layer. 
Congrats. You’ve entirely missed the point that they were making. 
The point was solving imaginary problems?
You have a gift for explaining fundamentals. That was so well worded.
Thank you 🌹 
Interesting! ... that makes me wonder then why every property 'var' inside of a Struct isn't tagged with 'mutating'? (I checked and it doesn't work but based on your explanation I thought it might be implicitly implied - I was wrong but can't understand why) struct Pasture { **mutating** var happy: Bool **mutating** var cows: Int mutating func produceBeef(\_ increase: Int) { self.cows += increase } } &amp;#x200B; // THANKS !!!
Nice 🙏🙏
That seems to work fine here! ~&gt; swift Welcome to Apple Swift version 5.0 (swiftlang-1001.0.60.3 clang-1001.0.37.8). Type :help for assistance. 1&gt; struct Pasture { 2. var cows:Int 3. mutating func produceBeef(_ increase: Int) { 4. self.cows += increase 5. } 6. } 7&gt; 8&gt; var p = Pasture(cows: 5) p: Pasture = { cows = 5 } 9&gt; p.produceBeef(10) 10&gt; print(p) Pasture(cows: 15)
Thank you :)
I actually do something very similar to the post's author. One advantage of having something like `APIRequest` is you can divorce the API from the environment. It makes it easy to write tests that specifically map to the service APIs I'm consuming. In my main project at work, the main 3 networking elements are - the endpoint - the environment (dev, localhost, production, etc.) - an "action" object, which has an endpoint, adds additional request details, and can make a URLRequest based on that input Here's a stripped down sample of what I mean (leaving out actually generating the URLComponents, etc.): https://pastebin.com/raw/2u6RUTrt I started off with everything in a big-ass enum, where every case was a different API service, but that quickly got unwieldy. I'm really happy with where we are now, because each component is really simple and can be tested in total isolation.
&gt; big ass-enum *** ^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
&gt;**mutating** var happy: Bool &gt; &gt;**mutating** var cows: Int &amp;#x200B;
You can't have properties in extension which is sometimes helpful. For example I have my equivalent of APIRequest which contains needsAuthorization property. If it's true my code will generate URLRequest with auth header. If I need to repeat the request I can generate new URLRequest that would possibly have different auth token. Basically, APIRequest is very specific to API you are using where URLRequest is designed to handle every possible API. 
Alamofire was designed to handle every possible API where your own client needs to handle only one API. And I would argue that Alamofire is 100 lines of networking code if you don't use certain features. And Alamofire doesn't even handle Codable, you still need to write a class that provides all available endpoints in type safe form.
I disagree with this sentiment completely. HTTP is an extremely mature technology, and your networking layer should be treated as something simple, not something dozens of people have to work on to get right over years. Alamo fire is designed to cover all possible networking cases, and as a result 90% of it is bloat in 90% of cases. How often has an app you’ve written used multi-part form data in the last 5 years? As far as the token exchange/retry example, to me that’s something which belongs in the API client layer rather than the networking layer, since it’s not *really* part of the HTTP spec. It’s actually not very complicated to implement that yourself either, and it is going to be a lot easier to debug issues from inside your own 100LOC solution than if something goes wrong inside a large obtuse library like Alamofire. 
But it’s the wrong approach to keep cramming all those things into one monolithic “networking framework”. It’s much better to have small, single-purpose tools and compose them to fit the problem you have to solve. 
Not too sure what you man - Maybe put some pseudocode up as an example?
I think you want to access an enum case based on a string? So like you have an enum like so: enum Test { case CaseOne; case CaseTwo; } And you want to get one of the cases based on a string. So if you have the string “CaseOne” you want ‘Test.CaseOne’. 
Yes! That's a better way of putting it
There may be a better way of doing it but I’d create a custom init for the enum that accepts the string as an argument. Then just have a switch statement that includes all of your cases. Kinda like so: init?(theString: String) { switch theString { case “CaseOne”: self = .CaseOne case “CaseTwo”: self = .CaseTwo } } 
 var index = 1 var aOrB = "a" enum Test { case String1a = "Question 1" case String1b = "Question 1b" Case String2a = "Another question" ... } func displayString() { textBox.text = Test.String[index][aOrB].rawValue } &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Did it!
If the enum is backed by a String it will get the init for free On mobile but basically add “: String” after the enum name 
I'll try that! Thank you!
Ah okay (yikes, by the way). I don’t know of a way to do this without actually creating a function on the enum that does the logic manually. Does that make sense?
/u/shitidiotturtle commented with a much better solution. This is actually built in: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawrepresentable/1538354-init
Thank you so much, I appreciated your detailed feedback and suggestions! FlexLayout looks really interesting. I was wondering if I should try and use any of these layout libraries in Tokamak, given how compelling they seem to be from the performance perspective. Ultimately I decided to stick to supporting auto layout for now to avoid making things more complex in the first version.
I may very well have to build one then haha
I don't think that solves my problem, though. That itinializes them, but how do I access them as in the example I gave?
Is that your actual use case? If so I think you might be much happier if you structure your data differently instead of using an enumeration here. PM if you’d like help! Good luck finding the testicle too. 
Thanks to slack for showing us huge emojis 🙌
🏎 
An enum may not be the best suited solution to this problem. However, sticking to the parameters of the question, one simple approach would be to leverage RawRepresentable. Rather than have the raw value be the question text (which blocks localization anyways), don't state the raw value at all: enum E : String { case foo // implicitly rawValue is "foo" } and move the question texts to a method on the enum that switches over the self.
I am trying to pick a video from the photo album and save that to a variable which i can then use to detect objects in the video. Does anyone know how I can save that video? Thanks
Dictionaries are unordered collections.
For what it’s worth “Value types are stored on the stack, reference types on the heap” does not paint the full picture: - value types are more accurately part of the thing they’re defined in; so if a class has a field that is a struct, the struct’s value is still going to be on the heap, not the stack (but it will be inside the class’s allocation) - some value types still allocate data on the heap regardless (for example, arrays and dictionaries) - classes can end up on the stack! But only as an optimization, if the compiler can prove the allocation will not escape. This sort of thing is not visible to the programmer, except as increases in performance.
Since I'm in a pedantic mood: They are iterating in an ordered manner, but their ordering is pretty damn opaque, using indices based on a hash of the keys (if you want to see the indices, look at `beenAsked.indices`). If you want it to have an order that you understand, you need to dump the dictionary into an array and then sort it according to your criteria. Sets have the same behavior.
&gt; Interesting! ... that makes me wonder then why every property 'var' inside of a Struct isn't tagged with 'mutating'? Because they're already marked with `var` (and for computed properties you also have the `set` accessor which is a sort of marking).

Heh, I wrote almost the exact same thing up but got distracted by work. Glad to see you posted it!
Oh... I guess I'll never get this morning back lol
There's much better ways to accomplish this: enum TestType: Hashable { case a, b } struct TestKey: Hashable { let index: Int let type: TestType } let tests: [TestKey:String] = [ TestKey(index: 1, type: .a): "Question 1", TestKey(index: 1, type: .b): "Question 1b", TestKey(index: 2, type: .a): "Question 1b"] if let displayString = tests[TestKey(index: 1, type: .a)] { print(displayString) // "Question 1" } What you're trying to do is create a complex key to look up a value. So create a type to use as the key, put all the information in it, make it `Hashable`, and use it to store key-value pairs in a `Dictionary`.
You could also use TextEdit and make the font size huge :)
True. 😉 In this case I meant that I only even noticed the swift logo, because slack used the emoji in a large size in their ‘all done’ screen. I would never have noticed, just by using the racing car emoji in messaging/etc.
When all of that functionality is built on top of `URLSession`, you can't really compose them together. The thing you have making network requests has to be the same thing that handles pinning, since that's the way `URLSession` handles server trusts. If you want to provide `URLCredential`s or cookies, it has to go through the same system. If you want background support, you have to go through `URLSessionConfiguration`. You can't compose a system like this.
That's a rather strange feeling to have, since the third party layer is likely better tested and more reviewed than your code.

Yeah but as far as freelancing work there’s not much else. If you go self employed and take contracts then you make much more on more reputable projects
It's no different than getting any other iOS development job, just that some companies may want you to have prior remote work experience. 
There's plenty of good freelancing jobs out there. Just not ones in the race to the bottom, those are quickly taken by people in developing nations who can get by on minimal pay. You'll never compete with them and you really shouldn't even try.
Well I’m developing countries the lowest paying freelance jobs are still much more paying than most jobs
Of course, I don't know how I missed that. I'll see if that fixes everything. Thank you!
Make your enum conform to CaseIterable (`enum Test: String, CaseIterable { ... }`), and then you can do `Test.allCases[index].rawValue`

Kachow!
You’re right, \`var\`s kind of are implicitly \`mutating\`—when you set them, that is. Getting a \`var\` property is not \`mutating\`. &amp;#x200B; \`mutating\` is a hint to the compiler that you can only call that method on \`var\` values, not \`let\` values. You don’t need that for \`var\` properties in your struct, since you can already only set a property for \`var\` values. &amp;#x200B; \`mutating var\` would be redundant.
I think it’s more to do with swift 5 and having it now apart of macOS itself. Rather than app thinning (unless they thin for the simulators). 
u are god **many thanks)**
And it's light out and away we go! 
It was a paid application but as it wasn't profitable, we have opensource the project for the community. So that's screenshots were the landing page of the product. 
Didn’t have any issues after the upgrade to 10.2 - just some additional warnings regarding the Hashable protocol and some reduntant visibility modifiers. 
Do you have some examples you can share? There are a lot of coders who may view some of these principles as subjective, since some guides may speak to different mindsets more efficiently. 
Where are you calling uniqueWeekDays(fortyIntervals:) ?
I know but I wanted to update through AppStore. I will download 10.1 from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) in case something is wrong. Thanks
I call it after I download and parse some weather data json. I'm using a delegate to show when I have the location (in a custom location class) and then in my view controller's delegate method, I call: func updateUIWithLocation() { weekForecastWeather.downloadWeekForecastWeather { DispatchQueue.main.async { \[**weak** **self**\] **in** **guard** **let** intervalTimes = **self**?.weekForecastWeather.threeHourTimes **else** { **return** } **self**?.uniqueWeekDays(fortyIntervals: intervalTimes) }}} 
I ended up changing it to .height, but it's still not functioning properly. It doesn't loop to it's height (although it's better than it was) and the the looped image is still cutoff. Any ideas? I'm guessing it may be my .position or .size inputs.
Is the texture at least as big as the screen? My next guess would be to try `backgound.size` instead of `BGTexture.size()` in your actions.
It's a placeholder texture before I go off and create my own. It's definitely not the correct ratio with the iPhone (5S) screen size (it's like a 3:2 ratio or maybe 1:3, I'd have to check again), however it stretches to the screen just fine with my .size config. I'm trying to make sure that it would work just fine and fit with every iPhone screen size and aspect ratio.
Just tried it. I changed the actions to background.size then tried replaing all of the BGTexture to background and still issues. When I do that, the looped image disappears completely. Also, sorry to keep bothering you with this, it's a bit frustrating and I can't really continue with the project without figuring this out. 
Walk through it in the debugger and observe everything. 
If you use Carthage installed with Homebrew there is a good chance it won't work. You will need to update to the latest Carthage code from their git repo. The latest Carthage code from \`master\` produces usable modules with Xcode 10.2.
Hi - I've worked remotely for years - I love it, but I found it really tricky to find opportunities on the big name job boards. So, I founded a little job board called myworkhive to make it easier for people to find interesting remote jobs. It only lists remote roles, and companies are asked to talk about their approach to remote working etc. It's free to use. (It's also a social enterprise which means we're developing projects to support people who've been out of work or had a long gap in their career, especially parents, carers etc.) We're doing some upgrades to the website over the next day or so, but maybe take a look next week if you like! A few more ideas - if you use the #remotejobs hashtag on Twitter, that sometimes brings up interesting things. Plus there are some big-name remote job boards out there now (these are often more US focused, but fully remote companies generally don't mind where you're based). And there are some interesting Digital Nomad facebook pages - they often have newsletters that share remote job listings (eg Digital Nomad Girls, Remote Like me etc.) I also share interesting remote jobs that I come across in myworkhive's newsletter, too. Anyway - hope that helps - happy job hunting! 
No, the behavior you remember was the default, but in Xcode 10, the default was changed to manual. To reenable automatic runs, just click and hold the play button on the top border of the debug section and select it.
Awesome thanks! Is it better practice to do this on manual?
Totally up to you IMO! In my experience, manual mode tends to be a bit more stable
For anyone interested – it looks like it's not a leak at all. It's heap fragmentation. The app is really only using a tiny amount of memory, but it's spread across lots of pages so the runtime can't hand the page back to the kernel. It appears to be happening due to some large, but temporary, heap allocations. There's lots of possible mitigations, but it sounds like the database driver and/or SwiftNIO need to get a little smarter about when they should explicitly return copies of data rather than sharing potentially very large temporary buffers.
There isn't anything system-wide, but you could definitely add a setting to your own app if you wanted to. You'd need to observe changes to that user defaults key, and update your layout on changes. Is it just one button you want to reposition? Or is it something spread through lots of different places in your app? For the record, the only built-in setting I know of that swaps things from left &lt;–&gt; right is your device's locale, because some languages like Arabic read right-to-left. Certain system controls like UIStackView and navigation bar button items will orient themselves based on RTL locales.

You can expect it in September. Just like 4.1

Do you valid source? 
I’m guessing around WWDC19, but that being said, it’s ready when it’s ready. 
You’ll also get a certain performance advantage with manual, since Xcode won’t waste resources on building the playground every time you change something, but before you’re ready to launch.
Hi! I have been learning the swift fundamentals and before continuing I wanted to put some of that knowledge into practice by making a simple Lottery Number Generating App. It's rather simple, press the button to generate 6 numbers between 1-37, no duplicates and showing in ascending order. Plus, one bonus ball between 1-8. After some mild breakdowns and much swearing...I had it working, but I still wasn't happy with the last part, which is updating the lottery numbers. I had a working method but it was cumbersome. Instead of updating each box individually I tried to create a simple loop, but I just can't get it to work and receive this error: Cannot invoke initializer for type 'init(_:)' with an argument list of type '([Int])' I also thought to put all the number boxes together under one UILabel and use the tag as an identified to update the number, but failed as well. Any help / suggestions / tips would be much appreciated :) import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { var bonusNumber = 0 var lottoNumbers = [Int]() var numberOfBalls = 6 @IBOutlet weak var Box1: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box2: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box3: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box4: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box5: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box6: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var Box7: UILabel! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() } @IBAction func Button(_ sender: UIButton) { createNumbers() createBonusNUmber() updateLottoNumbers() } func createNumbers() { lottoNumbers.removeAll() for index in 0 ..&lt; numberOfBalls { var number = Int.random(in: 1...37) while lottoNumbers.contains(number) { number = Int.random(in: 1...37) } lottoNumbers += [number] } } func createBonusNUmber(){ bonusNumber = Int.random(in: 1...8) } func updateLottoNumbers() { lottoNumbers.sort() var boxesArray = [Box1.text, Box2.text, Box3.text, Box4.text, Box5.text, Box6.text] for i in 0...5 { boxesArray = String(lottoNumbers) } //This method worked, but wasn't 'swifty' enough for my liking // Box1.text = String(lottoNumbers[0]) // Box2.text = String(lottoNumbers[1]) // Box3.text = String(lottoNumbers[2]) // Box4.text = String(lottoNumbers[3]) // Box5.text = String(lottoNumbers[4]) // Box6.text = String(lottoNumbers[5]) // Box7.text = String(bonusNumber) } } &amp;#x200B;
Maybe in May or June.
Show the appropriate error message to your user depending on the status code…
Coroutines are obviously something Kotlin does better than Swift. The other things? They’re basically equivalent. Kotlin has a bunch of cute built in higher order functions but you can trivially write those in Swift as well. Swift has a way better error handling model than Kotlin. Swift has better generics. Swift has protocol implementations through extensions. Swift has better ADT support. I think Kotlin does some cool stuff with properties and object expressions, and iirc Kotlin allows you to declare local extensions.
The only valid source for that would be Apple so if you can’t find anything on their Swift roadmap page then there *is* no valid source for the information you want.
It really depends... Most of the time I convert the error to a custom Error and if the error is documented properly I show either an error message or go to a different flow. It all depends on the shareholders, the UX and the visual design. However, I maintained an app for a large retailer and they had problems with their server which they couldn’t figure out, involving an API returning an error when users searching for something in the mobile app. So we build in that it would track the error and send it to the analytics. So this also depends on circumstances.
Please dont mix genetics with jvm, we don't need no creepy baby jvms running around, can you imagine the mutations?
&gt; Have a short, simple resume that shows key skills and interests. Don't be afraid to list a few hobbies or personal interests. Don't use overly flowery language, get straight to the point with technologies you've used and your past experiences. Have someone professional review it and give you feedback on it. Do NOT use crazy fonts, graphics, or formatting. Readability is the key. 100% this. People have no idea how to write a resume now days. A resume is supposed to give a company a quick but organized view of you, an interview is for the more personal aspect. I normally don't even do a separate cover page (though it's not a bad idea), since I don't expect people who are hiring to have time to read an entire page, they will probably just skim it, just try to have a good overview, not more than 5-6 sentences describing you, then get straight into the details. Label your sections so they can quickly check if you have what they are looking for, if those match, then you will get a call for an interview. I always tell anyone who is looking for job, think of it as you are interviewing the company not the company interviewing you. This lets you show that you have done your research, you will have questions for them, they will see that you are prepared. Too many people go into an interview and only answer questions, hiring managers often ask do you have any questions for us? Which normally get some generic answer. My belief is that if you get to the end of the interview and they don't have to ask you that, then you did well. Asking questions during the interview (not obnoxiously) help you create a real dialog with the person, instead of that person just going through a checklist. &amp;#x200B; Most of all, keep trying, keep learning, keep improving, if you do all these things, you will land a job eventually. &amp;#x200B;
I’m leaving Kotlin now, but annotations seems like a big thing that Swift is missing. Reflections support is more complete in Kotlin as well. 
This is a great question on how to improve ones learning habits. Kudos for asking! When I want to learn a new programming concept, I typically study multiple articles and videos, attempting to stitch together the different terminology and code examples into a rough, yet cohesive picture in my mind. This step can be tough if you don’t have a strong imagination, as it requires you to execute code with your mind only. It does get easier with practice, however. Next, I like to take this rough mental picture and build my own working example in Xcode, usually in a playground. I often borrow heavily from one or two samples to get started, but I always end up refactoring the code to use naming conventions and language constructs that better align with my brain’s way of thinking. Ultimately, my goal is to transcribe the unproven, non-working code in my mind into proven, working code on my computer. (As someone else suggested in this post, using a debugger to step through and see how your code is executed can be extremely valuable for getting better at step 1.) Lastly, as a backup strategy, I often commit my working code to a git repository and push it to GitHub. For example, here’s a playground I made when I wanted to learn how monads could work in Swift, specifically for Writer and IO types. https://github.com/ryansobol/swift-monads Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any follow up questions. In case you couldn’t tell, I love these kinds of discussions. :)
`for i in 0...5 { boxesArray = String(lottoNumbers) }` so in this line you're trying to convert lottoNumbers to string and then assign it to array of strings. First of all you can't convert arrays of int to string like that, and even if this will be possible you will assign String that will looks like this "1,2,3,4" to variable that is array of ints which is bad, cause you need to tell on which position you want to assign specific variable. So solution for this is: `for i in 0...5 {` `boxesArray[i] = String[lottoNumbers[i]` `}`
That's bullshit. The best programmers are creative. Problem solving is creative. New technologies are creative. There's no reason a programmer can't double as a designer. Some of the best UI programmers have a really strong sense of design. There's no reason a programmer can't double as a salesperson. Many successful programs started as a single developer pushing their work to the public. It's ironic you say something like this on a swift Reddit because apples moto is that it's the intersection of technology and liberal arts.
Approximately 0.1 past 5.
Kotlin doesn't have syntactic abstraction, so wouldn't you agree that Scheme is much more powerful than either one?
Try Firebase!
Firebase? 
I read that data is stored as a json file in firebase storage compatible with swift ?
Yeah it’s fully compatible with iOS.
Thanks for the answer !
Wouldn't "maximally efficient" be what the user is most familiar with? Surely no keyboard layout on your phone is "maximally efficient" in any sense other than familiarity. When I'm holding my phone in my left hand, would you consider me to be left handed? You're trying to be clever but I don't see any evidence that this is a worthwhile avenue to pursue.
Thank you !
Bit out of touch aren’t we? I’ve never understood these silly questions in the form of “when will X.x be released” for products will public development. Swift is open source you can make an educated guess just like anybody else. 
CloudKit. It’s free
Why is OP downvoted? This is a healthy discussion and I ask people to not downvote. 
Most of the solutions I've come across is converting http errors to an internal enum implementing the error protocol in the network layer and then converting to human readable errors at a later stage, as the services.
Don't use firebase, it's really not good. There is no good way of storing images because you need to use the storage, which for example has no basic functions of downloading folders. Also, the overall async way of downloading data is not there, you have to implement it all by your self, with escaping closures or with PromiseKit, and there is no way of checking for timeOuts, you have to do that also by your self. So if you make a request to the database, and the user turns off the internet connection, it will loop. In addition to all that, the documentation is really really bad and deprecated sometimes... I'm working on a project with firebase right now, and I'm hating it :D
Counterpoint: [Ceylon](https://ceylon-lang.org), a language that targeted the JVM and the JavaScript VM, had reified generics, a typesafe metamodel, and declaration-site variance. It also supported use-site variance for Java interoperability. It also had a bunch of other goodies like union and intersection types, flow-based typing, and comprehensions. Of course, development seems to have come to a halt shortly after RedHat transferred the language to Eclipse, so maybe it doesn’t count. I’m not claiming that it was “more powerful” than any other language either. I just like to bring it up at every opportunity because it was a pretty nice language.
Templates are mostly to show how each controller can be used. You should just learn how they interact with each other. Depending, any one app can and should use more than on kind of controller, or none even. 
Creativity is a secondary trait for programmers. Yes, you need to be flexible and open to new ideas, you need to be able to solve problems and not get stuck on old ways of thinking. There is some degree of creativity in that. But the term "creative" covers a huge range of ideas, many of which are not central to programming. Sometimes programmers are also designers, sometimes they are also salespeople, but those activities are not central to being a programmer. They are in addition to being a programmer. To emphasize the creativity aspect above the other traits means that you are losing focus on the methodical, mechanical, and technical aspects of programming. So I stand by my statement, you do not want a creative coder. If the programmer also happens to be creative that's great but the first emphasis should be on a technical coder.
Problem solving is inherently creative. It's just the preconceived notion that creativity just applies to art and media. It applies to programming every day. A programmer who isn't creative is one who's just copying preexisting solutions over and over again. A creative programmer is one who is innovative and can come up with solutions to issues themselves. 
Counter example: anything but Firebase. 
There are many algorithmic ways to solve various problems effectively. Creativity is sometimes helpful in solving certain problems but many times it's better to follow an algorithm correctly rather than try to come up with your own solution. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen people set out to reinvent the wheel simply because they wanted to be creative and come up with it on their own when there were far better tried-and-true canned solutions out there. Innovation is often the enemy of a clear, easy-to-follow, modular, and clean solution.
Being able to come up with new solutions doesn't preclude you from leaning or reusing existing solutions. But i would not hire someone who's work amounts to just grunt work of copying existing work. Nor would I hire someone who reinvents the wheel everytime. Ideal programmers are ones who know when to reuse something and when they hit a new problem, are able to come up with solutions. Similarly in art, you don't start from scratch on every thing, you lean on existing knowledge. That doesn't make an artist less creative.
Hi! Thanks for your response and explanation. Works great now. Xcode did force me to "Chain the optional using '?' to access member 'text' only for non-'nil' base values" Which if I understood correctly, means that if the box array value is nil, it won't display any numbers? func updateLottoNumbers() { lottoNumbers.sort() var boxesArray = [Box1, Box2, Box3, Box4, Box5, Box6] for i in 0...5 { boxesArray[i]?.text = String(lottoNumbers[i]) }
Does the service you are calling have documentation for the possible responses? It’s unlikely that any service will return every possible HTTP error. You only have to handle the ones that will be returned. For errors like 404 or 500 internal server errors, I usually let the user know that somethings going on and to try again later. If you are doing a get request and the request returns no results, you might want to handle this. Some places don’t consider this an error and might return a success response with some sort of message. At the end of the day, you need to know what the server is going to return to you and if it’s something the user can correct themselves, tell them what they did wrong and how to prevent it. If it’s something out of the users control (404, 500, etc..) tell then they need to try again later, or give them a means of contacting someone who can correct the issue. 
The way I do it is the "Main"-ViewModel creates &amp; holds all SubViewModels in an Array, and the ViewController takes that Array and creates the Views
There are a lot of network errors beyond just the transfer codes. For example, invalid JSON, an HTML response instead of JSON, local errors like network down, timeouts, DNS issues, etc. In general you want to keep the original error somewhere, even if just the log, and then translate it into a string that 1. The user can understand and 2. Might help you track down the problem. We generally translate them into a few carefully worded strings like "Can't reach server", "Can't read data from server", "Network timeout", etc. Just enough so we have an idea of what went wrong if someone contacts support before we even get the logs. Tracking network errors with analytics is a good idea, but remember that these are mobile devices with questionable networks so you will get a LOT of network errors that are essentially meaningless. There also may be privacy concerns if you want to track the full request/response data or sometimes even the URL. 
It's not hard to do the async yourself though. Maybe like 10 more lines of code and switching queues...
Cloudkit or firebase. I find firebase simple to setup and very good for solo development. 
Realm is ok. It has its strengths and weaknesses, worth taking a look at.
Very interesting read.

It’s been a little bit, but if I remember correctly anything between 200 and less than 300 is “OK” and you could attempt to parse the data you get back in this scenario. Anything in the 300’s are redirects; I don’t recall if you have to handle those yourself or if something like Alamofire will do that for you, but consider that a consideration. Anything outside of those ranges (if you want to keep things super simple) you can pretty much treat as “a failure.” Now whether your backend team is going to say return legitimate parseable data in scenarios like the 400’s is up to them. I’ve worked with teams that have done this and those that haven’t. So again just going from memory but here’s how I would handle these myself: * 200 to 299: Attempt to parse, if there’s an error parsing or no data, then it’s a “data error” and handle it that way * 300 to 399: Its some kind of redirect. You may have to handle this yourself, but it’s possible whatever networking library you use may do this. Most teams I’ve worked with don’t use redirects in their backend API. Your mileage may vary. * 400 to 499: These are typically “you don’t have access” or “I can’t find the document” errors. There’s one code within here related to “access denied” which you may want to take as “oh hey you’re logged out” and do something like re-Auth the user automatically or kick them back to the login screen but that’s up to you * 500’s: Server errors, I would just treat these as “internal server errors” * Anything outside the ranges listed above you can probably safely consider a “server error” or a “data error” At the very minimum, and just to get started, my advice would be to just have two ways of handling this: * 200 to 299 and data parses and also non-empty: Success * Literally anything else: Failure And then just improve / tweak that as you go. That’s usually how I start, anyway.
