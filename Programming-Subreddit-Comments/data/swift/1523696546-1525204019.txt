So you're adding them to the scrollview programmatically? I'd suggest you use layout anchors (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nslayoutanchor) then.
I am! I’ll look into that thanks!
I wouldn’t recommend the Stanford course to a programming beginner. He’s not explaining basics of coding and it would get discouraging because it’s too hard to keep up.
You are free to provide a better answer. But the reality is, the resources I used came from google searches and Apple's own template. Sometimes things just don't require a journey up the mountain to gain enlightenment. While "augmented reality" sounds like something that should be very involved and complicated, Apple has done most of the work for you. And if you already know SceneKit, it's just not going to take much time to get acclimated. And once you are past the basics of ARKit, the questions will likely relate more to any math required for more complex goals and asset creation. Those questions tend to merge right with Scenekit topics or not really be specific to the programming at all. 
Less than 2% of all apps obtain more than 1000 downloads in their first release year. This includes applications that are free. So let's assume you're a part of the top 2%. Let's also assume your application costs $1 (not free, but it's unlikely a $5 app gets 1000 downloads in the first year). 1000 * $1 / x (hours) = $7.25 / h (minimum wage in US) x ~= 138 hours In this case, your app would need to be completely finished within 5 days and be popular enough to amass 1000 downloads despite not being free. Not to mention this is to break even with minimum wage and doesn't include Apple's cut; if you're truly skilled enough to create your own application in 5 days and have it polished, you'd make a lot more by making application's for another company.
Hey friend! There’s a whole wide world of open source projects out there looking for contributors. Find a few that sound interesting, see if there are some small issues and start there. You’ll get familiar with the project and can take on bigger tasks. It’s a great way to learn with/from other people and contribute to the community. 
I’m really interested in this. Could you help point me in the direction to find out more or find some projects I can actually help on. I really want to learn, but I don’t know anyone who codes, and I want some feedback on what I’m doing. I’m hoping by helping on a project, I can get some general feedback and learn from some more experienced people. 
This is very specific to Spotify’s SDK and not specifically Swift. I would post this on Stackoverflow and tag it.
Yes I have written a couple personal apps in Swift. I’m actually more interested in writing code for the macOS platform, but I know there aren’t a lot of people doing that. I just want to learn, and I know I learn better by working on an actual project. 
[Elo rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is used for relative rating players in zero-sum games. How does that pertain to songs?
Yea I understand that, but in this case we can think of the songs as 'players'. They are randomly matched up against each other. The users decide which 'player', or song, wins. So to clarify any confusion, the user of the app is not the player that is being rated, rather, the songs are the 'players' and each individual song has its own rating based on the elo rating system. 
And how about those developers that are popular and publish a new app like for example Tapbots? (the makers of Tweetbot, Calcbot, etc), I thought this featured developers got better download rates.
Sometimes the REPL environment hangs for various reasons. I've found it best to change it to manually running, quitting Xcode, and then relaunching.
Would like to read about that for sure.
I understand what you are saying, but I am specifically targeting a single artist's entire discography. Although songs may still have an advantages over each other, assuming that each song has been exposed to a good amount of 'battles', it will reflect the general sentiment of favoritism towards each song relative to **each other**. And this is not to be confused with, how much the users like each of the songs. 
Here it’s! http://softauthor.com/ios-ui-design-programmatically-xcode-9-swift-4/
Well. I'm have e list named "why I hate swift" (which means I have some statistics now :) ) and there is 3 groups of reasons): - misleading error messages - mutual relations of generics, interfaces, and extantions (like unability to store objc method in extansion of generic type) - some syntax quirks which makes me to edit every method call after minor change. (like "try" before method call)
Show your code and attempts here first. What specific error are you getting? Thanks for not asking other people to write your code.
This is pretty easy and do a search on YouTube you will find tons of videos tell you how to do 
I really **dislike** the random **bold words**. They're too **dark** and pull the eye around when you're trying to **read**. *Italics* are better. However, even then, there'd just be way too *many* of them. Emphasis should be used sparingly for effect, not constantly and distractingly. Also, as a graphic designer and a programmer, I do get somewhat tired of people saying "You *must* build UI programatically! There are no other valid options!" Because some people think visually.
This is my $0.02, but I honestly think when Apple says Swift on Linux, they really mean Android. There’s some external attempts at using it for server side work, but that’s a solution looking for a problem. There are way more performant and mature solutions that already exist. Also, servers are rapidly giving way to lambda type setups, I just don’t see it ever going anywhere. If there was an Android SDK for Swift, that would be something to get excited about. Sever side, not so much. Oh, I program in Swift for a living fwiw.
Apparently IBM is actually the main backer behind Swift on Linux so Kitura will work. 
Apple certainly doesn't "mean" Android when they talk about Linux support, Lattner is quoted as using the term "world domination", and Linux is a great way forward for that. Thanks so much for taking the time to put this together! I'll check it out when I get a chance, really been wanting to play with Swift server side for a while. Do you have a preferred SDK, Vapor seems nice, though obviously Kitura has a lot more weight behind it.
I personally edge towards Vapor a bit, since: - They have a Ubuntu PPA. - Their documentation covers Linux more. Kitura kind of covers Linux, but the docs seem to mostly assume that you're developing on macOS. - They make some really awesome libraries along with Vapor itself. That being said, [twostraws has a comparison between them](https://github.com/twostraws/kitura-vs-vapor) too, so you can take a look there and see how you like it.
&gt; servers are rapidly giving way to lambda type setups What do you think those are running on exactly? Also, what incentive would Apple have to make it easier to develop good android apps? The more useful Swift is, the more people use it, and the easier it is for those people to transition to iOS development.
Maybe try user defaults or Core Data. Core Data can be a bit more cumbersome to setup. I think in your case user defaults might be your best bet. *still new to Swift so I’m sure there’s better options*
It may work, but it will never be popular. IBM hasn’t been relevant in SV in at least 25 years.
Out of the big 3 PaaS providers, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, how many offer serverless Swift as an option?
If you are processing the images as URLs then you can probably hit the network and then save to Core Data as strings. For simple stuff core data is pretty easy to work with (lots of YouTube tutorial like letsbuildthatapp has some). As long as you don’t have to process things on different threads it’ll work well in your case. User defaults might even work if it’s just URLs. If your downloading full on JPEGs and PNGs, maybe you can try setting up paths using FileManager however I think this is trickier as you might have to combine this with core data.
Short answer: Use a proper image cache, don't use NSUserDefaults or CoreData. Long answer: You should use a cache that stores/retrieves the data in file/memory as needed. NSCache is provided by Apple and can handle the memory cache side, but you'll want a filesystem backing store as well. If you're retrieving the image using URLSession, it has a disk/memory cache available out of the box. If you're retrieving the image through other means, you can use a library like [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) or [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift). I believe both use NSCache as the memory cache, but they will handle a lot of the common cache operations for you. Don't use NSUserDefaults or CoreData as they are not meant for storing binary data. I can't think of any cases where either tool is better than an actual image cache and they'll take more time to both implement and maintain.
Yea I am using the latest version of Xcode this is so frustrating. It randomly will work then stop working again 
[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) 
Swift as an Ubuntu package! Swift as a Docker image! Swift as a Snap bundle! Swift as a Flatpak! For the goal of "a great Swift experience on Linux", was an insufficient number of supported packaging systems really anyone's blocker? Yes, it could be easier to share Swift applications. There will be some day when that is my biggest problem with Swift on Linux. But first, can we get string sorting to work right?
Well, at least for me it was. ;) All my problems have stemmed from the fact that the official binaries depend so heavily on Ubuntu, and it takes so long to compile. Then I'm never sure how much I want to actually use it, since no one else will be able to run anything I make. What exactly do you mean by string sorting? 
I think Apple would love Swift on Android. Getting a larger community of Swift developers helps everyone. More libraries, more example code, more reason for Swift to expand to other areas than mobile app development. Not doing it doesn’t harm Android, as we’ve seen they’re moving onto Kotlin now anyway which has similar benefits as Swift in many ways. That said, I disagree with the post you were responding to
I wanted to specifically tell you more about navigation controller and handling segues but the lecture does better job at it 😅
&gt; setup to set up* setup is a noun 
Thank you so much for that. Note that a snap already exists as well. I miss a discussion space for swift on linux users, this reddit is so much focused on iOS!
It seems to work correctly, what do you mean by string sorting not working right?
I am still learning how to use bold/italic properly when writing blogs, for now I got rid of all the bold and start learning and use it in the future articles. Thanks for your feedback. Here are some of the reasons why I stopped using storyboard...One of the main things is if you build more sophisticated app with a lot of views and more custom views involved, coding everything is the right choice in my opinion. 1. Git Merge Conflict: when we merged the project, the storyboard conflicts were the real pain to fix and the alignment and constraints were off every single time, :( 2. IBAction/IBOutlet Issues: When I refactored the code by changing the IBOutlet/IBAction variable name after a few days of work, the app crashed for no reason and I had to reconnect them every time that happened. 3. Nested Views: when I added a few nested subviews under a view, it's hard to adjust if I wanted two subviews to be placed one behind other. On top of that, adding constraints to them was one of the frustrated things to do. 4. Compile Time: I had an opportunity built an app with around 35 storyboard scenes and after switching to complete code I noticed that compile time is lightning fast. Before I had an issue that as I add more scenes to my storyboard I had to wait a little longer even though I have pretty fast machine with 2GB graphics card and 16 GB memory.
I meant the initial VC of your app.
Oops.. my bad. I would say, I could but I do it for the consistency sake as other VCs of the project are handled by code. 
Nice project! 
‘catch { print("fuck") }’ Lol
Oh yes. Also try doing a search for //TODO 😅
There are a couple: https://www.reddit.com/r/ServerSideSwift/ https://www.reddit.com/r/ServerSwift/ But they're pretty quiet
Is it Linux compatible?
RxSwift is great when used properly, and an absolute nightmare when over-used. We use it extensively for interaction with global state and subscriptions inside view controllers (as well as other places). The key is to avoid what a lot of people do when they first try it out and create streams of streams of streams. You end up with this hyper-dimensional system that's impossible to debug. 
I believe they would fall into the top 2% like he said.
Check out Apples “Intro to App Development with Swift” iBook. I started with that with absolutely no coding experience and a year later I’ve got an app on the App Store. Excellent book.
You can watch some guides on YouTube, when I started, I watched “learn with Cris”, and after that, I’ve understood the basics, after “YouTube learning “ I started to read “ The Swift programming language “ in IBooks. I learned for three weeks, but I already can build some full working programs. Good luck in you projects!
There’s an online course called Design+Code that’s great for this. There’s a ton of content that doesn’t even have to do with coding, it goes pretty in depth on making sleek designs in Sketch and Xcode. Then goes over the code to make animations and such.
I see you already implemented your idea from scratch. I took the code from the link I provided earlier and updated it a bit, if you want to take a look and see if there's anything there to add to what you already have: [My Swift Multiplayer-ELO](https://github.com/colgraff/Multiplayer-ELO/blob/34ad0e6b3b1229818af495931c13602eb7fe54f5/swift/elo.swift) They have it as a finished set of games where a person took 1st, 2nd, etc. However, it could easily be adapted to a per-game basis.
You either have to pass in the `Game` instance to modify it or, even better, invert the call: struct Game { var turnCount: Int var playerList = [Player]() mutating func takesTurn(player: Int) { self.turnCount += 1 // do something with self.playerList[index] } struct Player { let hasName: String } } You see here that `takesTurn(player:)` operates on a `Game` instance instead of a `Player` instance.
Hi I moved from MVC to MVVM. MVVM is (in my opinion a great architectural pattern) a great way to keep your code clean. The disadvantage is that you need something for the UI binding. This is where RxSwift comes in handy. This allows me easily bind my viewcontrollers to my viewmodel. I have used it several times and I think I could not go back to the old method (working with delegates, emitters, etc). When I got the hang of binding my UI to my viewmodels with RxSwift, I took it a step further and implemented my whole network layer with RxSwift. You have to think in a different way and this is what makes reactive programming so hard. I can admin that the syntax for RxSwift (Rx in general) doesn't look that appealing but you get the hang of it after a while. I used the Ray Wenderlich book to learn RxSwift. It's hard at first, even when trying to make the examples. The best way to learn is to struggle with it in your own project. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or pm me.
Give Apples “Intro to App Development with Swift” iBook a try. That’s how I started learning and I found it extremely useful.
You need to use self.turnCount += 1 in the function definition.
Not familiar with the particular file format, but I'm sure it's possible to import/export CSV — which can be either trivial or a nightmare depending on your dataset. 
I think that providing the initial root view controller falls within the scope of the AppDelegate. In my opinion it would be worse to add an empty storyboard just to bootstrap a programmatic UI...
Thanks! I've been looking through it already and I think I'm going to be relying heavily on it once I'm ready to address specific problems. I'm trying to build the UI first through storyboarding (even though YouTube taught me it's less efficient in the long run) to give things more context.
Oooh, I've heard good things about Sketch. Been curious but the pricing was a barrier initially and I haven't known enough to know how worth while an investment it might be. 
What exactly do you want to do with it? The more specific you are the better chance we can help you find a solution. 
I always recommend Let’s Build That App on YouTube. His videos walk you through how to recreate the yo of popular apps. Helped me a lot when I was first starting out. 
i tried this but couldn’t use playground without a restart as we killed the prices. it won’t come back up when i re open playground. does this happen to you?
This is amazing. I think this will be my first priority resource to sift through and seems to be most closely aligned to what I was interested in finding (especially because....free)
Reviewed this, but I actually was a little more interested in the "Let's Build that App" method of doing auto layout because of the comments he makes re: memory/scaleablity by using pure coding vs. storyboarding. 
I say just pirate it and see how you like it. It’s a bit pricey, especially since they’ve moved to a subscription model. I use it every once in a while just to mess around. If you enjoy using it and it helps you out a lot, definitely consider purchasing it to support the developers. 
I'll have a look.
Typically weird double listing of methods, or listings belonging to "internal" protocols (starting with _).
Thanks, I'll check it out :)
You are so WWDC2017
From what I understand the double listing is due to something being declared in a base protocol or class and then declared again, for whatever reason, in a descendant. Leaking those "internal" protocols is probably a side-effect of something in the source code not being marked properly private. It certainly can't hurt to report the issues when you see them. Whether it's their header parser or the actual source that's the issue it still should be looked at.
That guide in its 4th part iirc explains adding constraints purely programmatically in native api too , lets build that is awesome as well , check the extensions he uses, its quite time saving and neat imho if ur going to go with code
I can't because self is a Game.Player and there's no Game.Player.turnCount. Thanks though.
I assume by "identify text" you only mean detect that text exists, but not convert it to a string value? As far as I know CoreML / Vision don't have an out of the box OCR feature but you could try SwiftOCR, or tesseract, or another ML model which is compatible with CoreML 
Check Core Data, it is easy to implement.
If you need to save the data to disk, I would recommend avoiding Core Data, UserDefaults, etc. and using the Keychain instead. Since you'll be dealing with sensitive information like credit card info, saving it directly to an unencrypted datastore is a bad idea. If you just want to save it in memory until you present the next view controller or something, you could probably make a struct called `CheckoutInfo` or something with static members: struct CheckoutInfo { static var name: String? // and so on } // In view controller 1: CheckoutInfo.name = nameTextField.text // In view controller 2: Order.name = CheckoutInfo.name 
I appreciate your reply. I think my title was a bit misleading.
No problem, also I'm a beginner for this language so that might have been a bit misleading as well.
I think inverting the call is the way to go, thanks. Will this also let me modify player properties? So let's say there's a property Game.Player.consecutiveTurnsTaken Could I have takesTurn(player: "Player 1") modify Player 1's consecutiveTurnsTaken value? Like: {mutating func takesTurn(_ player: Player]) player.consecutiveTurnsTaken += 1} ?
Yes and no. A big difference between a `struct` and a `class` is that the first has value semantics and the second has reference semantics. This means that when you pass a `struct` in a function it gets copied, when you pass a `class` it gets referenced. This: mutating func takesTurn(_ player: Player) { player.consecutiveTurnsTaken += 1 } Will take a `Player` instance, copy it, increase its `consecutiveTurnsTaken` property, and then discard the copy. The original will not be changed. If you do this: func takesTurn(_ player: inout Player) { player.consecutiveTurnsTaken += 1 } Then the `Player` instance will be copied in, modified, and copied back out. You call it like this: takesTurn(&amp;player) The `&amp;` means pass a reference to the object. Using `inout` can get messy though, it's something that generally gets used sparingly.
impressive! which coreml model / api did you use? I think the text checker api should be fairly simple by comparison. you create a text checker instance, feed it the detected string and then check for guesses and/or completions (both return an array of strings)
These are reasons 32 through 37 why I laugh at everyone who claims Swift runs on Linux. My suggestion is always to make your dev environment match your prod environment as much as possible, and in this case it means dropping Xcode, because you're not going to be building on Linux with an Xcode project file.
Ah, awesome, that's what I'm looking for. What are the major messes that occur with inout? I.e. what errors should I look out for or what pitfalls might I encounter by using inout?
Its a model called Alphanum. I tried to do it, but I am unable to get an output. I figure it is because there are frames being passed simultaneously and also the text changes with every frame. So the textchecker is unable to provide a proper result as far as I understand. 
The short answer is that until Xcode supports SPM more natively, you’re supposed to consider the xcodeproj file disposable. It should not be checked in. You basically aren’t supposed to be altering it. You should be able to regenerate it regularly. It’s a shim that exists so you can open SPM projects in Xcode and get code completion and debugging, and that’s all. Not a super satisfying answer, I know. We all look forward to the day when Xcode supports SPM better.
Hmmm. I typically don't pirate for a number of reasons but I'll check out the free trial. I wish they had a subscription plan that was monthly, as I find that's way less of a commitment.
I'm pretty rough on AR / ML but could potentially take a look at the data flow / threading. do you have a link to that model? I'd be curious to try it out for myself 
I recently found swift-xcode: https://github.com/SwiftXcode/swift-xcode that makes integrated Xcode and SPM much better, though I don't know if it will help your particular issues.
Further info: I’ve managed adding xibs to a scroll view, but I want to see the content of the scroll view on storyboard alongside the rest of the VC’s, so I’m trying to change using xibs to using actual view controllers, but I’m struggling and seem to be getting a sigabrt error, not sure why. Any help or tips would be appreciated!
Upvoted for the artwork. It's beautiful
They call me Picasso 
What you’re looking for is a [container view](https://naveenr.net/beginning-container-views-in-ios/) 
Search for Child ViewControllers as well. 
Will do, thanks!
Yes, although it's a little strange to embed tableViews (which are scrollviews themselves) inside other scrollViews. 
Imagine Instagram where you have a newsfeed. What I essentially want is a global newsfeed and a friends only newsfeed. I was going to accomplish this by having two newsfeeds you can swipe between. Is there a better way to do this?
See above please
Since you incur a penalty with every copy (it takes time and space to make a copy) you sometimes want to do it as little as possible. With `inout` you're making two copies of a `struct`, it could get expensive with large ones. Functions have natural entrances and exits. The parameters are at the entrance and the return value is at the exit. When you use `inout` you're making a parameter both an input and an output. Suppose you inadvertently modify that parameter, now you've output something you might not have meant to output. A `return` is declarative. You can scan a function for each one and quickly see all the exits. You know what's being output. You can also follow a more declarative approach and reap the benefits of immutability when you only use `return` values. For example: func fooInout(bar: inout Int){} func fooReturn(bar: Int) -&gt; Int {} var oldNewBar = 5 fooInout(&amp;oldNewBar) // inout has to be var oldNewBar = fooReturn(oldNewBar) // return can be var let oldBar = 5 let newBar = fooReturn(oldBar) // return can be let So with an `inout` you need to use a `var`. With a `return` you can use either a `var` or a `let. You get to choose which one is more appropriate for your use. It also looks cleaner. One variable is getting set to something else, it's easy to scan over code and see it.
Interesting. Thanks. Why not use a 2 page UIPageViewController as mentioned? 
...good point. I suppose the simplest answer would be because I’m a noob! Haha thanks!
: D I suspect that you might run into some bumps when putting those together. Don't be afraid to post again if you run into some difficulty. Cheers.
Yup, use UIPageViewController. It was made for this purpose 😀
Thanks a lot! Will do
No worries, sounds like you're close to getting it all dialed. Definitely shouldn't be getting a `nil` value. Instead of passing the context to the second viewController, you could reference it directly from the App Delegate instead. That would ensure you have a view context when the view controller loads. Honestly, it's not the best way to go about it, but could potentially help you figure out why you might be getting a `nil` value. Example(assuming you have the view context in your app delegate): persistentContainer = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer
Thanks! I’m going to give scrollview a try and report back!
To be fair, my code runs GREAT on Linux. It’s the DEVELOPMENT process that’s a pain in the butt! (Although I do wish there were official Swift RPMS for RedHat/CentOS)

Are you are trying to write out the CoreDataClass by hand? I haven't done that nor want to. I fill out my xcdatamodel which is a list of Entities, Attributes, etc. Change my Codegen to Manual/None. Go to Editor and "Create NSManagedObject Subclasses". It spits out the relevant code. The book I read is Core Data by Tutorials.

I have 2014 mbp which was really slow to do any coding anymore and out of disk space. I dropped 3 grand on a new mbp last weekend and started using playground. As I am typing, playground gets stuck. force quit and go back almost 4 lines of code gone and I am just running xcode but the fan is making sound and it's over heating. Not what expected of xcode or mbp. 
Have you tried casting them to `NSNumber` / `Number` and then using properties like `doubleValue`, `intValue`, etc? In addition, I would *strongly* recommend using Codable instead. `JSONSerialization` still exists but using Codable will be much safer and it will make it much easier to validate your JSON and ensure that it's in the right format. Your code above could be condensed into this: struct PartialItem: Codable { let group: String let id: String let something: Int let somethingElse: Int let updatedAt: Double } let partialItem = try JSONDecoder().decode(PartialItem.self, from: payload) There's no possibility of you misspelling a key name or something, and if `payload` doesn't match, you'll get a nice error thrown that tells you why not. If you want a property to be optional, just mark it optional and Codable will figure it out.
I must be tired. Please consider this solved. The server was returning `somethingElse` and `updatedAt` as strings while returning `something` as a number. That much was not obvious using only `print()`. 
With core data you use relationships, these are demoted by Set&lt;MyClass&gt;, as said though you should do this via an xcModel for automatic file generation
It's a radical departure from the usual flat style!
(I think it’s this one)[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tP4OGvIRUC4]
I created a [blog post](https://flyingmoose.co/blog/ios/collapsible-comments-feed-in-swift.html) about this awhile back when I ran into the same issue
If you set up your constraints correctly, you just need to remove the one attaching the cell’s bottom edge to the content’s bottom edge and reattach the cell’s bottom edge to somewhere near the top. Stick that change in an animate block and you’re good to go.
You’re off to the right start. Option A: (Expandable Cell) (1) UITableViewAutomaticDimension (2) That means each cells gets the height caluclated by its internal NSLayoutCobstraints (3) have two different (sets of) layoutconstraints, turn one off and the other on to change height Option B: Have separate cell for the comments that gets added/removed from the tableview Depends a little on use case, I used option A in many apps.
Easiest way I could see: import Foundation func feetToFeetInches(_ value: Double) -&gt; String { let formatter = MeasurementFormatter() formatter.unitOptions = .providedUnit formatter.unitStyle = .short let rounded = value.rounded(.towardZero) let feet = Measurement(value: rounded, unit: UnitLength.feet) let inches = Measurement(value: value - rounded, unit: UnitLength.feet).converted(to: .inches) return ("\(formatter.string(from: feet)) \(formatter.string(from: inches))") } print(feetToFeetInches(318.5)) You could wrap that up in a custom `Formatter` but it's probably overkill.
I understand being confused about how to test a bunch of asynchronous code - that can be difficult. The book covers mocking and stubbing, which is what I'd do for the situation you're describing. Ideally, you'll have separate methods that you call in each completion block, and you can test those separate methods individually, using mocks and stubs as needed. I think the book will help you figure out how to test what you're looking for, but if not, you can always request a refund.
Are you saying that with option A, it's not necessary to reload the cell in order to change its height? Just using the appropriate constraints is enough? That is pretty nice. 
Just to go ahead and knock out the simple solution just incase: What does the YouTube URL look like? It’s the /watch?v=id right? So when you append the autoplay param you should use an `&amp;` instead of a question mark.
Is it possible to discuss about the data flow and threading? What would the best way to contact you? Thanks
Or use URLComponents to add it and generate a proper URL. 
Yup, a number of apps of previous clients use this technique. I also use it in looc.io but we haven't released yet. You might want to call `setNeedsLayout`, but not 100% on whether thats really needed.
What's with all the cryptocurrency posts on r/swift, I wonder? There's more posts about cryptocurrency than Apple's own GameKit, or the sandbox. What's the appeal? Other language subreddits I follow don't have anywhere near the level of interest in cryptocurrencies.
Swift is a great language. Not just for iOS Apps but also for Command Line Tools, Server Software etc. Because of that many people in the cryptocurrency community are building stuff in Swift. That's my story at least...
Did you try [googling for your question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42252619/measurementformatter-to-display-feet-and-inches)?
Awesome thank you so much! Thankfully I work for a company that is in the software world that I hope to move up into but just in case I would like to know what most places look for as my company is mostly Ruby but has iOS for our mobile app (Shopify)
I am working on Musicler, a tool for automatically tagging M4A audio files using metadata from the iTunes Store. https://github.com/ahyattdev/Musicler
Wow thank you for responding. I’ll definitely check the book out soon. I appreciate your reply!
The type inference system in Swift is pretty solid and I use that as much as I can. One thing I do to avoid confusion is to add the the type in the name of my variable/constant. For e.g a variable to represent the age would be age but an array that holds first names would be firstNameStrings (the plural indicates it's an array)
Oh nice. I might hijack that haha
No problem! And since you're already with a company that works in iOS/software dev... you are in an enviable position. I would pick the brains of the engineers as much as you can. Obviously, don't hassle them all day but really get to know what they do and see if any of them are willing to help mentor you. MVC = Model View Controller. It's Apple's recommended design pattern for iOS apps. The "model" is the structure that holds all your data, the "controller" contains all the logic that manipulates the data and the "view" is.. well, it's how you display the data. MVC dictates that the model and the view do **not** talk to one another; the controller handles requests from the view, fetches data from the model and hands it back to the view. Some argue that MVC is too simple for complex apps which is why MVC is sometimes derided as "Massive View Controller" (the code in the controller gets massive.) But for starting out, stick with MVC. MVVM is similar to MVC and VIPER... well I have no clue what VIPER is haha. OOP = Object Oriented Programming. Swift is *technically* a multi-paradigm language but is generally used as an OOP language. &gt;and a noob question... When I was watching some of the videos they said you could implicitly specify what you are using IE: String, Integer, Bool etc... or you could let Xcode/Swift infer. What would you recommend? Is there a common practice? It depends. Swift infers really well for the obvious ones. For example, if I was initializing a String instance I would *not* write it as: let stringExample: String = "hello" That's just unnecessarily verbose. However, there are times where you do want to specify the type. The one that comes to mind is the `Decimal` type in Swift. If I was dealing with money in an app, I would want it to be accurate and floating point numbers are not exact. If you rely on type inference, `let dollarAmount = 3.78" is initiated as a `Double` and I want it to be of type `Decimal`. So I would specify `let dollarAmount: Decimal = 3.78"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_aFqEmL5JI&amp;t=1s&amp;autoplay=1 I think, with your solution, this is the correct way of formatting the Url, right? if so, it doesn't work. still loads up and you have to click play to play the video
I do, but it isn't working after adding "?autoplay=1" to the Url.

This post has some great advice/answers. I’m in the same boat as OP and actually skipped over the git section in the online course I’m taking. Needless to say I will be circling back a vigorously studying! Thanks! 
Post some code that shows what you're doing. It'll help us understand what's going on and how we can help. Text please, not images.
Haven't used it in too long tbh, when I used it wasn't a very good experience and felt unnecessarily complex. Simpler solutions have worked better for me.
Just use a stack view and set height to 0 or remove view. You can add stack view to scroll view.

Other question answer: no.
I gave that a try before I coded my solution. For some reason that property didn't work for me so I'm not sure the information there is correct. Anyways, `LengthFormatter` is being discouraged for use, `MeasurementFormatter` is its replacement. From the [LengthFormatter docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/lengthformatter): &gt; As of iOS 10, macOS 10.12, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3, Foundation provides the MeasurementFormatter class, which can be used to represent quantities of UnitLength to provide equivalent functionality to LengthFormatter. You are encouraged to transition to these new Foundation Units and Measurements APIs whenever possible.
Hey just one really important point. Moving from arrays to working a job has a lot of steps in between. If you're serious about this path get to the point where you have something on the app store. That's when you're ready to apply for jobs. 
One of these two links might have the answer you're looking for: https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/8cjl6n/im_using_wkwebview_for_embedding_youtube_videos/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47485833/autoplay-youtube-videos-in-wkwebview-with-ios-11?rq=1 The second one was linked from the first and seems to have a possible solution.
I think the previous commenter is trying to get you to include "YouTube Parameters" in your search for a solution.
Sure thing. I submitted a question on StackOverflow that has all of the info. You can find it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49889256/swift-openssl-error-validating-cms-signature)
Hopefully it gets some traction there. I'll take a look and see if I can spot anything that helps.
When it comes to type inference, Swift is really good at it, *but* don't overuse it because the compiler can get really slow at figuring out what you're trying to say and it can quickly degrade into a mess that makes your project take 20x longer to compile than it should. You should check out [this article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/11/how-to-make-swift-compile-faster). Some syntax might be confusing or weird if you're just getting started, but it has useful advice for when you move up in skill level.

I absolutely agree with you regarding var names. On objects like labels however I always start with the kind of object for faster typing with auto completion because I might have an object and a var for said object that will modify the data somehow. Eg.: username = labelUsername.text 
This! I’m programming in swift for over a year. Published my first app this January and got a job last week. That app allowed me to be called for interviews and to show what my work looks like. 
You need to implement this function: webView(_:decidePolicyFor:decisionHandler:) Then use the callback “decisionHandler” to allow/disallow navigation requests. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate/1455641-webview
So here's the first aspect. How do you draw the lines? This is an edge detection problem and involves using specific filters to find them. From this you can create regions. It is my belief that this is the hard problem of the app. Rather than that it's actually not too hard to do image transformations in swift. There are many libraries to support this (or were 9 months ago when I was working on this problem) Another possibility is to generalize similar colors together. This is a similar methodology to edge detection. You'd convert to Gray scale and then call everything within a certain pixel distance from one another a region. Then there's a hybrid approach, doing both. Which is also an option. Google search edge detection methods, converting to gray scale, and get familiar what the underlying data of an image looks like. 
We can't guess what you might be doing. You need to post your program in order to get help.
Just to add some context to this, WKWebView finally is enforcing the same origin policy in a reasonable way unlike UIWwbView who’s file: origin literally disable SOP and was a common horrible bug in many apps
So, I've come across this, but it didn't have any affect toward solving the problem. Could it be the way I'm implementing it? extension QuizViewController: WKNavigationDelegate { // When question finishes loading then update ViewController title func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) { self.title = "Question: " + webView.title! } func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationActionPolicy) -&gt; Void) { decisionHandler(.allow) } func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationResponse: WKNavigationResponse, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationResponsePolicy) -&gt; Void) { decisionHandler(.allow) } }
Could you give me an example of why this is important?
Actually this kind of naming doesn’t sound like a good practice for me. I would recommend to read Clean Code book. It has a lot of experience about good practices (authors used Java, but ideas are similar in my opinion). Good luck with your journey :) 
“You should move to the trash” Right in the feels
With 0 specification of your area.
Sorry, iOS is the area. But in general I thought there is maybe a site which has all the swift areas as filter…
Agree. OP need to post the code to github and we can debug it
Thanks so much. I'm not at home to try it now but I'll give it a go this evening and see how it works out.
Isn’t the protocol the class/struct needs to adhere to is decodable ? I guess I need to read up on the documentation more
Not iOS, whereabouts do you live? Certain services work better in certain locations than others.
Not sure how much you can get out of it because it’s in Portuguese and only available in the português App Store but here: https://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/eblx/id1336049428?l=en&amp;mt=8 It’s a basic app to access the Lisbon Public Library catalog I use Firebase for the backend, probably the source code is more useful than the app: https://github.com/atticmanatee/eBLX 
Meaning?
You’re initializing the path with a rect. That draws the border. Just initialize it with nothing: let path = UIBezierPath()
In a post, if you put 4 spaces in front of each line of your code then it will all be formatted as code.
When a tap gesture is made it calls the method `dropLocation(sender:)` on the object in the `target` parameter. Since your object is `self` it calls the current object's `dropLocation(sender:)`. Using `#selector` is a way of saying ["a method that has this signature"](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/hannibal-selector/).
Never heard of it before.
Looks like a known bug. I'd look at the reddit link below and see how they resolved it. https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/82006 https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/6l80gj/json_problem_in_app_development_with_swifts/
I don't think I would search for 'Swift' jobs, I'd be more specific. I see you mentioned iOS. Quite a few of the iOS jobs are Swift/ObjC. If you search sites for iOS developer, you should get more hits. IMO, iOS dev jobs are very geo-specific. Meaning that you'll find tons of them in Silicon Valley and other tech startup hot spots, but few of them in other geo-areas. iOS dev (IMO) is NOT like regular programming. You can find all kinds of programming jobs all over the place, but finding iOS jobs isn't the same. One other thing I noticed is that when you search for iOS dev, you get all kinds of junk that had nothing to do with iOS. They'll come back with 100 hits and only 5 have anything to do with iOS.
IMO, once you understand the basics, it's time to jump into a real world project. A project that isn't covered by any tutorial so that you have to find the answers yourself. This is what I did a few years ago. I made a list of what was being asked for on the job listings. Things like Core Data, RESTful, etc... Then I made an app from scratch. I added things like slider menus, static view controllers, scrolling data entry screens, cached data from RSS feeds, etc... There was no one tutorial that covered all these things. Some covered Core Data, others RESTful, so I had to put it all together and figure out how to make it all work. IMO, Angela Yu's course should be enough for you to get there, but that also depends on how complex of an app that you pick. One thing that's kinda fun is to pick an app from the app store and try to recreate it.
That’s interesting...maybe try setting self as the navigation delegate in loadView when you’re instantiating the web view. Other than that I’m not sure what to tell you. It could be that WKWebView doesn’t support loading local resources as well as UIWebView.
I noticed their site didn't have a list of classes and the short list they had said "coming soon". They did a KickStarter 2 years ago, raised some good money and don't have the classes ready yet. No list of classes, subjects, projects, nothing. I'd pass.
Meaning getting an iOS job is easier in NYC and the Bay Area than in nowhere Missouri. 
This. If you open playground, you can use Editor-&gt;Structure-&gt;Indent Right
I actually look in Europe, Germany.

"One other thing I noticed is that when you search for iOS dev, you get all kinds of junk that had nothing to do with iOS." I very agree on this. But what is the solution? "iOS dev \(IMO\) is NOT like regular programming. You can find all kinds of programming jobs all over the place, but finding iOS jobs isn't the same." Can you tell me more on this topic? Thx :\)
That solved a bunch of my problems. Thanks!
That's a bit like asking why you can't find any construction jobs which focus entirely on hammers.
&gt; iOS dev (IMO) is NOT like regular programming. Huh?
It’s a horrible security bug. If an attacker can get something to load in the file: context they can both read files from your app directory (ie steal user data) while also being able to steal any cookies to any sites that the user already signed into with your app. This is/was probably the worst vulnerability your iOS app could have 
What’s is your use case? 
What do you mean by that?
I use devslopes course from udemy. I guess I paid 15$ for it. You should also get it for same. They have latest swift 4 and xcode 9 course out there. Just put your browser in incognito mode before going to that website. Udemy sees if you visit more than 1 times to that particular course they increase the price in subsequent visits before buying. 
So basically I should figure out how to get the urls from the images I have in storage and put them in a database 
I would start by picking a more specific area than just 'iOS dev'. I started in mobile back in 2009 mainly because I saw that the "smart phone" was really just a portable computer and that they would take work away from the PC. I see mobile as being similar to what the PC is in terms of all the different jobs. You have categories and sub categories. I would pick one: Example: Games-&gt;2Dgames, 3Dgames, ARKit games, etc... Utilities, business, communications, database, etc... You can also target different types of companies, startups-&gt;well funded, startups-&gt;not well funded, established companies, etc... I wouldn't think of mobile dev as new anymore... It was new, but now they are looking for people with 3~5 years, a degree, several complex apps published. One thing I haven't seen a lot of (yet) is asking for industry specific knowledge. Example: health care, logistics, POM, banking, etc... As far as finding them, the demand is high, but not for entry level devs. IMO, those days are long gone. Having the skills and knowledge, you'll probably be finding the jobs on LinkedIn, meetups, SO, Dice, etc... IMO once businesses start making more internal apps for their business, there'll be more jobs spread around. Right now, it's still a mix. Mobile start out with everyone seeing the app store as a gold mine, then it got flooded, so tons of 'coders' started looking for 'bubble jobs' with startups mainly in Silicon Valley and some other tech hubs. Now the market has been flooded with self taught 'coders' looking to cash in. Most universities don't offer mobile specific degrees, some offer a few classes like Stanford. Even the tests they give for jobs, these coding challenges where you write a sort or tree, etc... If you decompiled the top 200 apps, how many would have a hand crafted sort or tree? I'm personally focused on full stack and mobile enterprise solutions. These are industry specific solutions that require in depth knowledge of an industry. If you don't have the degree and a few years professional exp, I'd focus on doing complex open source projects and look into startups and internships.
Again I’m just practicing with it but my goal is to have a post feed with only images. It’s anonymous signing in and I uploaded to firebase works I’m just stuck on retrieving the images to put in an array to then put in a table view. Most tutorials seem to pull the urls from a database which is why I asked
Yes. Also in Firebase SDK there is no, get all files option as far as I know. Let’s day you can’t get all the images in a bucket and display them in a table or collection view.. that’s why you use the database, you get the urls from that and download from the storage 
I mean you can technically name the file location for each image as the download url of the image in Firebase storage but it would probably be more ideal to put the download url of the images in the database and the pictures in storage. You can download them by fetching the urls from the live database 
Ok and it should be written up as when they hit “post or upload image” button it should send the photos data to storage and it’s url to database?
If you mapped the distribution of iOS jobs vs C# / Java / JS / Webdev / Security / client server etc... You'd see iOS is not all over the place. Most iOS jobs are going to be in tech startup hubs, not all, but most. Compare that with other tech jobs like server manager, security, etc... These jobs are all over. Go to most companies and see how many programmers they have, then look at how many iOS programmers they have. This may be changing over time, but get a listing of jobs in major cities and compare. Someone just asked not long ago about iOS jobs in San Diego, CA. There were about 3 at the time. Right now there are 3 and 2 are testers. Until businesses hire more in house iOS devs, this isn't likely to change much. Not only that, but iOS isn't the whole thing in mobile. So a company looking for internal mobile app dev would be looking at iOS devs, Android devs, back end devs... All the sudden it gets expensive.
Like a said , depends on your use case of uploaded files... But if you wanna upload bunch of images and display all of them later , yes the way to go is upload the file to storage and write urls to the firestore database
I think that's 10 years total experience, they go on to say: &gt; Need a sr. level consultant, will be responsible for Designing, planning and development and may sometimes dictate technical standards, including coding standards, tools, or platforms. &gt; &gt; At least 4+ years of experience in developing native iOS applications It's still a good amount of time but it's not for an entry-level position. I'd expect 10 years plus for a senior-level position.
cool if you need help send me your code and i can help you out 
You wouldn't embed the 3d model in the QR code. There's just not enough data that can be held in a qr code at the block sizes and redundancy needed to be scanned correctly. Instead your QR code would give you back a resource string which you can parse to figure out which model to load up. These models would be part of your app. 
I noticed the 4+ later on, but they are still leading in with 10+. I don't even know if you can have 10+. The app store started in 08 and IIRC, it wasn't "open" at the start. Devs had to convince Jobs to make it open. I think it was web apps only or something. 10+ iOS would mean they would have started before the App Store started. Either way, the overall point is that they keep asking for more and more. People coming in now should understand that just because you can write an app, doesn't mean you'll be getting these jobs.
There's a flood of less-experienced programmers on the market now. Companies are starting to realize they need to focus on quality over quantity and they want to spend a bit more to hire experience. They still recruit for entry-level positions but they tend to do it through internships and such. It's getting harder to be a solo app developer and then transition into a corporate programmer.
I’ve been looking for a Jr iOS position for 6 months now and I come across these postings all the time. It’s really annoying. They say 10+ years because they are looking for a senior level. But what can be considered a senior level? Have multiple apps in the App Store? Or have a github repo filled with different projects with multiple Apple technologies? Or does it mean working professionally for a company for 10+ years? Well I have been told by recruiters that it comes down to years worked professionally.. but how can a person have “Professional” experience if a company isn’t willing to give people a chance? Everyone is different at learning. Some catch on quicker than others. But companies just want to hire people that can hit the ground running. They don’t want to spend their time/resources building a developer the way they need him to be, instead they want to hire stubborn senior dev that would question all the decisions made the the project manager. The hiring process is fucked up imo... 
Thanks. That's the thread /u/JimDabell posted above. I'll see if that solves it.
Yeah, that made me laugh but feel bad at the same time.
&gt; They don’t want to spend their time/resources building a developer the way they need him to be That's why when they are looking for junior programmers they want someone with a degree, someone who went through school and was part of a program. Yes, those people might not have real-world experience yet but they at least have a decent chance of having the basics of theory. Too many self-taught programmers just learn what they need to make a basic app and don't have proper training in design patterns, structures, and algorithms. Companies will take people from non-traditional paths but it's a huge risk and you really have to stand out from the sea of self-taught programmers out there. It's much safer for them to go with interns, college-graduates, and senior programmers.
Your taskDate is not initialized day so is nil and you are force unwrapping it
are you manually calling the `@IBAction` before `viewDidLoad()` gets called?
I wonder what the path forward would be... seems like far too many self taught, less-experienced programmers. If they can't go the solo app dev path to corporate, then what path do they have? IDK if the demand will level off or not, so something has to give.
You gotta do it yourself, no one is gonna help you do your homework...
I see from the StackOverflow post that you got it figured out. Glad to hear it, it seemed like something was off on the cert from what you posted.
This is part of the catch-22 problem. It's quite an investment for a company to hire a developer. There's the direct knowledge of the platform, language, APIs/frameworks, etc... Then there's the how will they do in a professional environment. Asking for a number of years of professional programming really clears the field. If you've worked professionally as a programmer, then they know they can teach you anything. I've seen some of the work that the people have done when they complain about not being able to get a job. Most of them were a joke. Just cut-n-paste stuff together and say "look at what I did". I did a code challenge for a couple of big companies and one was to make a game engine, others are things I've never ever done in real life. I think the recruiters are just using whatever tools they can to filter out the "cut-n-paste" programmers. I've seen people apply for jobs and have people right there helping them answer the questions, they have book on how to prep. I just found that Swift isn't used for Amazon's code test, so you have to learn something else just to pass the test. That means that at least on of the biggest companies, doesn't accept tests in ANY LANGUAGE USED IN IOS DEVELOPMENT. Think about that, ObjC/Swift aren't even used for code tests. I can see things from the companies stand point. We've hired some real crap programmers and they really create a mess. I've seen them down servers and write worthless code. 
I actually really like that first post as it covers exactly what they want, realistically, without any BS. The description matches about 75% of my dev team....genuine senior iOS devs....30someting CS majors with 10 to 20 years coding, the last 5+ years in iOS land. These guys have worked at several companies, completed and maintained numerous projects in multiple languages. They can reliably drop into any codebase and deliver product priorities without hand holding. The company is making it clear that they don't want some 25 year old kit who just got promoted to "Senior Team Lead IOS Ninja" who has only worked on one app which was just him and maybe an intern for 3 months. That said, if you're modestly shy of the decade mark but otherwise a fit it's probably still worth sending a resume. They're just signaling "seriously we want experience." I also really like that the job description/requirements are actually a realistic reflection of what it takes to be a senior iOS dev. There's no unrelated tech, unrealistic requirements, or woowoo BS.
Hmm, I already had the navigationDelegate = self. I've done some more testing and found that the path "../../content/footer.html" is what breaks. When I move the iframe relative path to "footer.html", it has no problem loading. Does this raise any flags to the problem? &gt; /content &gt;&gt; footer.html &gt; quiz &gt;&gt; appendix &gt;&gt;&gt; appendix_b1.html &lt;-- webView.loadFileURL(htmlPath, allowingReadAccessTo: htmlPath) points here
&gt; func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, &gt; decidePolicyFor navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, &gt; decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationActionPolicy) -&gt; Void) { &gt; decisionHandler(.allow) &gt; } Ahh thanks, does then doing something like this then open an app up to the same security bug?
Better to use a CADisplayLink for this case.
Interesting to see other people are struggling too. I’ve been looking for a job for almost a year now. I don’t have a degree (but I was told it’s not necessary), graduated from a coding bootcamp, have a messenger app on the App Store, and my own website with Swift tutorials. Not a single callback for an interview, after 143 applications, and several follow up emails. Absolutely nobody wants junior devs. It’s really frustrating.
I saw this as the future 5 years ago. Focus on a skill outside of programming. Gen Z coming up behind us will lower the cost of programmers to the same level as non-skilled labor. Its not worth the time and money invested to learn and will always be changing. Learn a trade like plumbing or electrician, you’ll get paid more than programmers and have a more stable work environment. 
I guess I phrased it wrong. How does it know to pass UITapGestureRecognizer as an input parameter to the function?
&gt; They don’t want to spend their time/resources building a developer the way they need him to be This post is for a consultant. Consultant means very senior dev who can drop into anything and get things done. Even if the codebase is an abomination and the company has no clue how to develop software, the consultant should be able teach the company how to do software development. This is a very very non-junior position for a company that doesn't have the time for educating juniors and may well not even have the capability. On the other hand I totally agree that lots of companies that could hire and mentor juniors don't, and they really ought to. Likewise their junior job post are often absurd. Jr plus any years professional experience is retarded. The fact that some genuinely Jr positions have to draw attention to this with "new grads" or similar keywords in the title is mind boggling.
I was pissed years ago when my brother in law with NO education (GED) was making the same as me. I was a programmer with a degree and he painted state buildings. BTW, those languages I used then, aren't used anymore. So I had to spend HUGE time keeping up with things.
This is by far the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Of course the software development field is changing and will continue to change, but Gen Z includes people who are currently 13-23 years old, so they'll hit the job market in masses in 5 years. Are you saying that the average programmer will be paid $10/hour in 5 years, similar to non-skilled labor? Do you have any research to back this up or just a crystal ball?
Yeeeep. Non-skilled laborers in factories around where i live have an average starting wage of $15-20/hr with no experience needed nowadays. I made my brother with aspergers living in Washington state move here, he’s making $17/hr now. 
&gt; 10+ iOS would mean they would have started before the App Store started. &gt; &gt; But it's not what they're asking for. They want someone who is senior and has at least 10 years of development experience. Not an outlandish requirement at all, you wouldn't hire someone out of university to be the lead developer (in this case it looks like you might be the only one lol). I've seen ridiculous requirements (like more years of experience in Swift than the language has been out for publicly) but this one isn't. I'd qualify for this position easily and I know people with a ton more qualifications than i have
When a field is flooded with too many people, what happens to the wages? This is basic econ101 stuff. 
We can't find applicants in the Cincinnati area! Here is a link to our job posting: [Job posting](https://recruiting.adp.com/srccar/nghome.guid?c=1060841&amp;d=External&amp;r=5000317418506) I'm even willing to split the referral fee if hired!
not on the cs track. signed up for this course as a minor in high school to try it out but unable to make much time for it
I did point out that the header was different than the 4 years iOS, but this is different than what most were asking for before. Before it was just 3~5 iOS, this is the first that I've seen asking for 10+. Seems the bar is being raised again. I think it was about 3 years ago when they started asking for anything near 3~5 years. &gt;(in this case it looks like you might be the only one lol). Me? I'm not fresh out of university, that was many years ago. I'm just pointing out trends in the iOS dev job market because a lot of people seem to be hitting a wall trying to get into the market. We've been getting pretty regular post from people trying to get into the job market and not getting any bites. This is the 1st job post I've seen asking for 10+ years for any iOS job.
My brother in law was getting 25/hr and that's what I was getting once. What most don't realize about tech is that it has a limited shelf life. Non-stop learning just to make a living.
Non-stop learning is the only reason I stopped. Once you’re coming around 35-40 years old, you still have another 15-20 years of a career to maintain and can’t be investing the time needed to stay up to date. 
10+ years is not uncommon for a Senior developer (although I've seen some places give that title to 5+ years developers)
I did have an initial idea to apply the CIPixelate filter to the image and then move from there. Based on your suggestion, would I have to use edge detection on the pixelated image to draw out the boxes? 
That's weird. I actually like learning new stuff but I'm learning in paid time. That really helps.
It doesn't seem like it's asking for too much. It might be because you're in OH. That posting could be in Silicon Valley and would probably be filled. I'm really glad to see iOS jobs being spread out. Cincinnati isn't a nowhere city, but not a mobile startup hot spot either. These are the kinds of jobs that should be the growth area for the future.
Looks like the job posting is gone. I just looked up two of them and posted a link to one, now that link has a dead end.
Are you saying trends aren’t able to easily be identified? 
They aren't able to easily be identified by random reddit users. You can't just declare the future of a trend without backing it up with reliable information from someone else.
During the DotCom era, they were asking for 10~15 years C/C++, so it's not out of the ballpark, but I never saw it for iOS before now. I've been tracking iOS jobs since about 2010 and never seen 10 years before now. Not that surprised, I know it'll become the standard someday, just didn't expect it to jump from 3~5 years to 10. Maybe 5~7...
One of the "never talked about" parts of STEM (programming mostly) is that the shelf life of your knowledge is so short that people get rotated out of the system. I love tech, but it's not the best way to earn a living.
iOS isn't special here. 10+ years experience is a common threshold for senior developers, and that job only requires 4+ years with iOS. With tech stacks, companies will usually just dump everything there (though usually not *twice* like you did), and it's not expected you'll have extensive experience with all of them, even when it says "required". "iOS developer" doesn't mean "developer who knows iOS and no other technologies". "Junior developer" doesn't mean "no experience at all". When I went through school, the conventional wisdom was that engineers needed to do *at least* one internship if they wanted any hope of getting a job. Today, people expect to read through an online tutorial, and get a high paying job. If you go the self-taught path, that's cool and I totally understand, but you're going to need to work twice as hard as anyone else to prove that you'll be a smart choice for a hire, next to someone who just spent 4 years in college and worked every summer at an internship in Silicon Valley. Where's your portfolio? Where's your blog? Where's your pile of open-source software, that you've written or contributed to? Companies are looking for quality hires, but quality is impossible to measure directly. School and experience are proxies for quality. If you don't have either of those, you need to create some others.
True, but a dev in the valley would be asking for shares, a parking spot (because who wants to ride the BART?), and catered meals.
I can't see it being a $10/hr job, but I think the flood is causing problems in another way. There seems to be a flood of 'coders' that aren't getting the jobs and kinda screwup up the application process a bit. Not a real problem, they'll just do coding challenges and weed people out. Kinda sad to see people work at something and not reach their goal. IMO, the mobile industry will move forward and leave low skilled 'coders' behind. They can't drive down the wages if they aren't qualified for the jobs.
Probably because in 2010, minus 10 years experience is 2000, and iOS didn’t exist. iOS came out in 2007. 10 years of iOS development is crazy, considering you’d have to have been involved since it’s inception. 
Don't sign up for courses you can't dedicate your time to.
&gt; But what can be considered a senior level? As good as the average developer who meets their requirements. &gt; Well I have been told by recruiters that it comes down to years worked professionally. And you believe what recruiters tell you? &gt; but how can a person have “Professional” experience if a company isn’t willing to give people a chance? It costs $50 to form an LLC -- that's half the price of becoming a registered Apple Developer. *You* can be the company that gives you a chance. Or just go out and look. How many companies did you ask, and how many companies are within walking distance of your front door? There's a local small business I frequent, and when the owner heard I made software, asked me if I knew about mobile development, and if I wanted to work out something in trade. Everybody wants mobile software these days, and most people don't have GOOG/AAPL/FB's budget for it. &gt; But companies just want to hire people that can hit the ground running. They don’t want to spend their time/resources building a developer the way they need him to be, instead they want to hire stubborn senior dev that would question all the decisions made the the project manager. The first sentence is true, and the second sentence seems to go off the rails somewhere and I'm not sure what it means. &gt; 99% of the time the ones that write those ridiculous job post are recruiters that have no knowledge in programming. You seem to have realized, somewhere in the past 10 sentences, that recruiters are idiots! &gt; Because most software companies don’t have HR and they outsource. Then you have to explain to the recruiters what you have built/know just for them not to understand wtf you are saying lol then you have to say all that shit back to the technical person in the company. It’s a big waste of time. The Indian recruiters are the worst.... There's some truth in that, which is why you should never go through recruiters, if you know what company you want to work for. Didn't you read "What Color is your Parachute?"? &gt; Honestly your best is if no one wants to hire you, you gotta create your own lane... create an app that provides a service that hasn’t been made yet. That’s what I’m in the process of doing. That's one way to avoid the whole mess. Best of luck!
NYC I hadn’t thought about doing YT tutorials, mine are all written out.
Lol
NYC should have some good jobs. I used LinkedIn and had my YT channel linked with an ObjC static VC tutorial. It was a really crappy tutorial with a camera over device and shaky but it proved I knew the code.
BTW, the corresponding NSView method calls its parameter "dirtyRect" rather than just "rect", and that name might be better at suggesting what it's for. UIBezierPath(rect: rect) doesn't look obviously wrong in the same way that UIBezierPath(rect: dirtyRect) does.
The UITapGestureRecognizer is the object that is calling the function. The function's use of "sender" is to give it the ability to find out or restrict who is calling it. So your app detects a tap, the tap gesture recognizer is called, which then calls the function. So the sender is pointing at some of this chain of events. The function just knows something called it. And rather than test for everything, you can just up and say a UITapGestureRecognizer called and it can start from there. Rather than a case where the sender could be "Any" if gesture == sender as! UITapGestureRecognizer {} You hit the ground running with: let tapPoint = sender.location(in: mapView)
yeah I just lie when people ask me for an absurd amount of experience/technology background. I came across a job the other day that wanted 8+ years of VR/AR experience, Swift, C++, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, Elixir, React, and SQL. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN BUILDING
We have offices in SF, and you aren't wrong...
I tried to go back and fix the link, but the link is dead. Sorry about that :D That's seems to be the real value of the degree, it filters people out. If you've worked for any company as a programmer for a year or two, you at least prove that you can probably learn things. IMO, if this is a new standard, or if it will be a new standard, it just means that iOS is growing into a real platform for professional and the "look at me, I have an app, give me a job" people will be cast aside.
Why wouldn't you run that ad in the Valley?
The position is in our Cincinnati office. Trying to convince a dev from SF to move to Cincinnati is nearly impossible.
They tend to find out if you have the skills or not. They might not care about the actual years, but the skills will either be there or not. Having said that, I can't see 8 years AR/VR. ARKit just came out. I did some AR stuff years ago, but that was just silly games.
What I meant was why not just move the job to SF? I've never been to OH, but the upper/middle East coast is quite a bit different. One upside to people with skills in high demand is that they get to live where they want. That kinda explains why California has a pretty good lock on tech. I'm commute distance to Silicon Valley and the weather is usually pretty awesome. We had 70's all thru the Winter.
Yeah, maybe the variable was changed in code, but the corresponding change was not made in the storyboard.
Hey! How's things going? I shelved that eMail project and I'm moving forward on full stack and Python. Found out Swift isn't used for code challenges, so I'm learning Python now.
Something sounds wrong with that. You have a CS degree and know iOS? Do you have a link to your GitHub and any apps you've developed? Have you worked as a programmer? If you haven't worked as a programmer, that could be the limiting factor. We should have a sub for "roast my resume, code, etc..." just for iOS.
Lmao
iOS doesn't seem to be a big deal because I live outside Silicon Valley, but inside of commute distance. That creates a vacuum here because if you have iOS skills, you commute into the Valley, so there really aren't any iOS jobs around here. I've seen about 5 of them over the years. One thing that kills the market for tech when you're outside the Valley is that they try to sell it as "cheaper labor" but the people with skills just commute in. It costs some $500/mo to get a train ticket and you make about twice the money.
numberOfRows is a delegate method for a table view. The table view is calling the numberOfRows function when it loads it's data to display. Check out https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io/the-complete-understanding-of-swift-delegate-and-data-source-9c91ecd7f1 on delegates if you haven't run into the concept before. 
&gt; I’ve been looking for a job for almost a year now. I don’t have a degree (but I was told it’s not necessary) &gt; Absolutely nobody wants junior devs. It’s really frustrating. Unfortunately you were given bad advice. Sure when companies can't find qualified people they'll hire anyone that can do the job, but preference will always be given to whoever has more experience. Bootcamps don't count for much, they're mostly good at taking your money. 
I think it's because like /u/thisischemistry said, there's a flood of inexperienced developers and companies are trying to find ways to filter them out
Oh, so you're talking about the job market, not programming.
I have 20 years of Cocoa experience starting with specializing in NeXT WebObjects. Totally doable.
It is a little difficult to get your head around this. But some where in code you would've said ```tableView.dataSource = self``` this is telling the tableView which object is responsible for giving it the data it needs to display. When the tableView is ready it will ask it's data source, how many rows it has to display and then when it needs to display the cell, it will ask the tableView the information it needs to display the cell at that particular index path...
I think that's the case. I can imagine with the economy going this strong and a bunch of low experience programmers hitting the market, there's a backlash to this.
Yes, the iOS job market specifically compared to the job market for programming in general.
What they were actually asking for was better detailed in the rest of the job posted. I guess it's deleted now, the link is dead. They were looking for 10+ years but only 4 needed to be in iOS. It's really the point of what they are asking for now vs what they were asking for just 2 years ago.
Maybe iOS has reached the point where the CS degree isn't enough to get in the door. I can't say that I'd be very surprised by this because iOS is a lot more than just CS stuff. It's sad to see this happen, a STEM degree was touted as 'THE' answer to a great career. I'd be pissed if I had a bunch of student loans and no jobs.
Yea maybe.. I would even say not only iOS but other positions as well. I guess it just comes down to if you are in the right place in the right time. As in if you have built an Uber clone and you applied to a job that is looking for experience in making an app like Uber. Then maybe you can land the job 🤷🏽‍♂️
I think it depends on whether or not you have programming/computer science experience when going into the bootcamp. There are lots of people who got jobs upon graduation, but they had years of professional programming experience before going into the bootcamp to learn iOS. So that was pretty disheartening, I went into it thinking it was for people who had zero experience and wanted to learn from the ground up. I won’t say it was a waste of money because I definitely learned a ton about developing for iOS. But I was definitely naive in thinking that I’d have offers being thrown at me when I graduated. All I ever heard people talking about was the massive demand for developers. I just never realized what they were talking about was a massive demand for senior devs, and almost zero demand for juniors. But that’s the classic catch-22 of the job market.
Thanks! I posted all the code, I don't see tableView.dataSource = self anywhere? 
No actually that makes it significantly worse because now even regular websites (not in the file: context!) have the SOP disabled 
It can be wired up in interface builder too. It doesn't have to be in code.
This could be because the delegate is linked in the interface builder. If you open up the interface builder, click on the table view and open the connections inspector on the right pane, you should see delegate under the outlets, and it should be set.
I applied for a job during the DotCom era and missed the lead position by 1 day. Months later, I ended working there and the guy that got the job I missed was now my boss. I got hired in November, when the new year rolled around, all the reports failed. They all failed because my boss used "MM/DD/YYYY" as a part of the index. Later he made a simple loop to get inventory input, he opened the database table every time in the loop instead of opening it once at the start and closing it when done. The program took 60 seconds for each item to be logged into the system. He had transient dependency in the databases because he didn't trust them. He convinced the company to spend big money on a big AS/400 server that didn't even connect to the front end we had. I quit to work for another company and found that the big server was NEVER used. They merged with First Data and he was let go. He was at the highest level an IT person can get and still be IT. CIO... They let the CIO go after 15 years. Being at the right place at the right time can make the fool look wise.
Cool, looks like the thread became a hot topic of the day :D I didn't think it would get so much attention.
been going pretty well! just been working on some projects but thats cool! full stack as in web dev?
Just like colleges offering degrees. Your better off learning the fundamentals online for free. 
In reality, you would not connect to the SQL database directly. You will need some sort of an API in between that handles the interaction between the clients (iOS and tvOS) and server. There are multiple ways to build this API and configure the server depending on whether you want to use the MEAN stack, or even Firebase but I'm not sure if Firebase has an SDK for tvOS. On the client side, you will need NSURLSession on iOS (I'm not sure how tvOS does it but from what I remember they have some sort of xml type language to do so). While you are looking into NSURLSession, it's worth mentioning that you should look in to the Codable protocol to help you encode/decode JSON objects that you will be sending back and forth...
I believe you did not hook up your taskDate date picker to the XIB/storyboard.
Lol I remember this job I have now, I applied around January. I’m guessing the person who got the position instead of me didn’t do to well. 
I guess that's kind of an upside to the flood of lesser skilled programmers. They come in and screw things up and the company has a better appreciation for skilled programmers. In the case I sited above, it backfired as my boss ended up running things like a bootcamp and I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone else in the company except him. The main regret that I have is that I didn't quit sooner. I stayed there for 2 years and passed on what would have been a MUCH better job.
You can also create an AdHoc profile and release a beta build through a service like AppCenter it you don’t want to deal with creating an iTunesConnect account for your friend or submitting the app for external beta testing. 
It's because the Guided project was developed in the most recent version of Xcode. You must be on an earlier version. go to App Store update Xcode and it should work.
Wow, mobile dev has got to be one of the fastest growing fields around. This is more about how it's going from an low skill job, to a professional developer job like other programming positions. I don't think anyone would buy the argument that mobile dev is dying. In fact, web dev is the area that's flooded with off shore dev working for peanuts. RN has such a small market share that it's not even worth talking about.
Across industries and trades, a degree or experience shows evidence of quality for a candidate. My advice is to apply to consulting organizations, even less reputable places like Tata, as they're more likely to take the risk on a candidate. Landing a job there is a great way to build evidence of quality for yourself. iOS and front end product development are not great for juniors, since there's a lot of the crucial customer experience affected. Juniors are often unit testing, working on internal web applications, things like that.
Fabric is a great option if you don’t want to go through a TestFlight review, or a manual ipa install via iTunes. Follow the getting started here https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/overview.html to create an account with fabric, add the SDK to your app, and after you are all set up, all you have to do is archive your app, you can invite your friend and distribute it via Fabric.
Sort of. `Decodable` is for types that can be decoded, while `Encodable` is for types that can be encoded. `Codable` is just a typealias for `Encodable &amp; Decodable`, which means that `Codable` types conform to `Encodable` and `Decodable`.
Are you honestly saying CODERS are going to be irrelevant in a few years? Literally my toaster has software that needed to be coded. Software developers will be the last job on the planet to be phased out.
If a value is a `Bool` you don't need to compare it to `true` to see if it is `true, that just produces another `Bool`. This is equivalent to what you posted: if switchControl.isOn &amp;&amp; taskDate.isHidden { taskDate.isHidden = false } else { taskDate.isHidden = true } You can also skip the `if..else` entirely since you're already dealing with `Bool` values: taskDate.isHidden = !(switchControl.isOn &amp;&amp; taskDate.isHidden) You can prove that they're the same with a truth table: .isOn | .isHidden | .isOn &amp;&amp; .isHidden | !(.isOn &amp;&amp; .isHidden) --- true | true | true | false true | false | false | true false | true | false | true false | false | false | true
I didn’t say irrelevant. I said too many people in a talent pool lowers average wages. 
I’m working on a an app on my own where I’ve written the backend API in .NET core using MSSQL hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and the front end in swift for iOS and Java native for Android. Has it been a lot of work? Absolutely, but I’m really glad I took it on, because I wanted to have a comprehensive understanding of how to build and ship an app to market. And it’ll be much easier for the next app I want to make because I have a lot of boilerplate code I can reference. Spreading that time out between different technologies means it’d be hard for me to be a master of any one single tech, but I’m ok with that. At the end of the day, I just want to know these platforms enough to CREATE, not to be a total guru ninja. And if people totally focus on one tech, that’s cool too, people like myself need those people to help us out on occasion as well.
Sounds like you have a good handle on things. I'm not sure I agree with the "Spreading that time out" part. I worked for Visa as a senior programmer analyst for years. I also managed all the database servers. Most of my time spent on writing front end apps was NOT spent on learning, it was spent doing things I already knew how to do. One of the arguments in the link was about IF a person can learn both front end and back end. Others were saying it can't be done, yet I did it for years. It's like saying if someone learns English, they'll never be able to learn any other language. Even in programming, I can program on several different platforms. What happens after you know enough to write an app? Does the brain refuse to learn anything more? No, you can continue to learn more and more. I've spend the last 2 week learning full stack, back end development. In that amount of time, I actually have an API working. It's Node.JS and I'm doing Python next. I don't see it as taking time from something else because learning iOS dev is not 100% of anyone's life. A person can learn a whole lot more in life that just one platform.
Was his name DD?
I'm not sure I agree though. In my 30s, I find that it's been easier for me to settle down and spend evenings learning new technologies. Not because I feel the obligation too "keep up" at work, but because I enjoy it and have enough experience now with languages that it's not as confusing as it once was. I see no reason why this wouldn't continue into my 50s and onward. Sure, there are more important "life" things now, but an hour or two a day still goes a long way.
Probably
Don't violate copyright. It's illegal regardless. 
Absolutely it will, your breaking a law?...
LOL sorry stupid question 
Haha you're fine i didn't take it as rude it was a dumb question... what i really meant to ask was if I am able to use titles of an artist's songs in uilabels without getting my app rejected? 
Pages now supports exporting to ePub now too
Switch is usually used for more than on or off in Swift. Like switching based on an enum. Sounds like you are just looking for Bool. Which is true or false. Something like: var diceSides = 6 if isGeekDice { diceSides = 24 } Switch would be switch diceType{ case .casino: diceSides = 6 case .geek: diceSides = 24 case .halfGeek: diceSides = 12 case .aRoundBall diceSides = 120 default: //if not exhaustive diceSides = 6 }
What I'm trying to do is let users vote on which of the artist's songs they like better. So I would present two song names of the artist in a UILabel. This would be okay for the app store?
Awesome thank you!
Do you mean a UI switch that you can tap on and off, or a switch statement?
I meant UI switch. I didn’t realize there was a statement too. Like I said, super new.
No worries, I’m new myself. As for your question, I’m in bed now and almost asleep but will come back to this tomorrow. Should be super easy if I’m understanding correctly. I think you basically want to say, if switch.state = on (only used a switch a few times so I’m not sure the correct syntax), call your rollDice function with the sixSidedDieArray passed in, else call rollDice with twentyFourSidedDieArray passed in.
/r/RecruitingHell
Pm me I’ll see if I have any open roles. 
Could you please post an example? 
Sorry I made a mistake if you want to just capitalise the first word of a string in a sentence e.g “i like ice cream “ you just do string.capitalised() 
I get all the words in the sentence capitalized. " I Like Ice Cream"
Well you could use this: `var foobar = "i like ice cream"` `var stringCapitalized = lowercased.capitalized` `//prints: "I Like Ice Cream"` But of course we'd have to know... What version of Swift are you writing in?
Well I like it to be "I like ice cream" not "I Like Ice Cream", but thank you. Swift 4.1
Temporary workaround: Make the first word capitalized in the string manually and use .lowercase when the sentence is after a comma. 
You have a screenshot of this message? If so, you show email it to apple and demand and apology from Cook personally 
Really... what kind of programming jobs are easier to find In Missouri?
This is likely not the best implementation but for my few test cases this seems to work for what you need. create an extension for string, mutating and non-mutating functions: extension String { func capitalizingFirstLetter() -&gt; String { return prefix(1).uppercased() + dropFirst() } mutating func capitalizeFirstLetterOfSentence() { var capitalized = "" let sentences = self.split(separator: ".") for var sentence in sentences{ if sentence.first == " "{ sentence.removeFirst() capitalized = capitalized + " " + String(sentence).capitalizingFirstLetter() + "." }else{ capitalized = capitalized + String(sentence).capitalizingFirstLetter() + "." } } self = capitalized } } then you can just call .capitalizeFirstLetterOfSentence() on your strings like so. var test1 = "hello." var test2 = "some string. another string." var test3 = "hello reddit, this is a test. my name is bobby. this is my pet." // "Hello." test1.capitalizeFirstLetterOfSentence() // "Some string. Another string." test2.capitalizeFirstLetterOfSentence() // var test3 = "Hello reddit, this is a test. My name is bobby. This is my pet." test3.capitalizeFirstLetterOfSentence()
I've got 10+ years of iOS development experience, maybe I should apply?
I’ve recently been using a free InstallrApp account (https://www.installrapp.com). You need to input your Apple ID and developer certificate and they take care of all of the signing for you, and your friend can install over the air.
that job have been removed. Just give some overview from our side, as we're hiring right now. For the junior front-end job we got 93 applications! And you know, that we're startup, not a big popular company. But still, so many junior developers were looking for a job in Ukraine! It's super difficult to choose only one person from so many candidates. Could you imagine, how many folks are applying to some big companies? With that competition big companies can rise the expectation (which sometimes really becomes ridiculous). 
import UIKit var str = "hello, playground. i like coding. i hate bugs." var arr = str.components(separatedBy: ".") str.removeFirst() var convertedSentence = "" for var sentence in arr { if sentence.first == " "{ sentence.removeFirst() } if sentence.first != nil{ convertedSentence += sentence.prefix(1).uppercased() + String(sentence.dropFirst() + "." + " ") } } print(convertedSentence)
A lot of people that work in Silicon Valley don't live there or live on the cheap. I remember when I was in college they had guides for costs of living. I lived in a small studio apartment and drove an old beat up car. I lived on much less that what the guides called for. There's a reason that the commute into the Valley is packed every work day. You can gain a HUGE advantage by simple living outside the Valley and commuting in.
This is really the problem. Of the 93 applications, how many actually have real world skills. There's a flood of people on the job market looking to score a great paying job. They do a few 'coding tutorials' and think they're ready for the real world. Companies have no choice but to raise the bar because they need people that can actually program and not just cut-n-paste their way thru a project. They lie on the resume, they read practice books on how to "crack the interview", yet they still don't have real world skills.
You must of jumped in at the very start. I actually started with Android in 2009, then jumped over to iOS after a few months because it was so easy for someone to steal your work on Android and iOS was where the money was. Still remember that teapot app. Bought a $280 iPodTouch and was running that self balancing teapot app.
To bad playgrounds don't work for more than 5 minutes straight.
Your app will get rejected if you use assets that belong to Apple (e.g. iOS springboard icons), but probably not if you use assets from a third party. But still, you might be violating a copyright and will face legal issues with the original creator of the content.
&gt; Of the 93 applications, how many actually have real world skills. only 30% have some small commercial experience. All the rest are just from the development courses and might have 1-2 study projects. 
&gt; They do a few 'coding tutorials' and think they're ready for the real world and they lie on the resume. this was so bad... People put empty GitHub profiles with some bullshit code, wrote about "management experience", put tools which they can't use without a team and made some silly mistakes in naming skills or tools. The average level of junior applications was low. Soon we will publish an article in Russian about typical mistakes for junior candidates. That might help some folks. Otherwise, I was upset to see so many people who worked in the supermarket and tried to pretend that front-end is the thing of their life... 
I think thats a general trend in the industry not Swift/iOS specific. Java developer? No good knowing just java, will need sql, maven, git, spring, microservices etc. etc. I moved across to doing pure SQL development 10+ years ago but now even on the MS stack its SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, Power Bi etc etc. Its just bullshit to me the IT industry, perhaps I'm too jaded and been in it too long I think :) 
If you spent just 1 hour on each one (reading the resume, evaluating the skills, etc...) you'd spend over 2 weeks of full time work. Then you also have to consider how many people lie. It's a lot of work finding good people. One of the points of my post is that the iOS job market is changing. I started back in 09, came from C# .net client server and have never ever seen any job market change so fast as mobile. They've clearly flooded the market with low skilled people that were looking to cash in on great jobs. Imagine if you added a filter for at least 1 year professional experience... 
I agree. I was in SQL dev before iOS came out. I came from the DotCom, client server era and one thing that was different about mobile is that it really didn't pull a lot from other tech. Mobile came out as a new world. It was laughed at by professional devs as being "little toys". Now you see that it's becoming a profession. They are finally weeding out the "I made an app run, so give me a 6 figure job" people and are looking at people that have been thru the trenches. I'm actually glad this if finally happening to mobile. I knew back in 09 that these smart phones would become an important business tool.
&gt; Imagine if you added a filter for at least 1 year professional experience... but that also means that junior people will not have any chance to get a job. How to fix this?
&gt; "Senior Team Lead IOS Ninja" yeah, have seen some local companies had such titles :) 
The solution is for these people to do an internship and prove themselves. One thing that is very different about programming is that you can write a program and prove that you know what you're doing. IMO, the real problem is that people come in thinking "what do I need to do to get this job" vs "I really want to learn this profession". The reason this is a problem is that the learning never stops. I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/8bssqa/what_is_considered_full_stack_developer/ About "full stack" development. I got down voted to the point where parts were removed from sight because some childish posters where crying that "you can't do iOS dev AND backend". These childish people are looking for the easy way to a great job. That's the problem and that's why the industry is saying 10+ years or don't apply. The Jr Devs will have to prove themselves thru low end programming jobs, maybe not iOS because iOS is fast moving and they need top end devs, not entry level devs. BTW, one of the key things to look for is the attitude towards learning. I've seen so many that'll stop as soon as they think they've done what it takes. They don't want to do any more work that is actually needed to get the job. I was like that in High School when I had a min wage job, I've grow up since then.
let string = "i love ice cream" var components = string.components(separatedBy: " ") print(components) components[0] = components[0].capitalized print(components) 
I can’t tell how many times I restarted Xcode. It is very nice idea but why they don’t fix it I don’t get it.
Worst advice 
One of the questions asked is if you use copyrighted material in your app and if you do if you have the rights to use them. Well one of the things you could do is getting written permission to use it. I would hate you to use my logo or face on your application without even asking.
Nice solution, I hoped that something like extension would work. Thank you for your effort.
you could do it with an extension, but since you need to store the closure you’d need to use associated objects (part of the objective c run time)
Playgrounds are for learning and teaching. Development is a different animal and it's a mistake to use the wrong tool for the job.
I agree. Although it would be nice to have a live view of what you’re working on right now. Playgrounds right now can handle so very basic views but once you add a tiny amount of complexity everything goes to shit
Since you have started a week ago, you may find difficult to find information at the right place. There are two ways to get the information you want. 1) simply put in google search and you will find stackoverflow page which will have something you are looking for. Mind you , this is easy option but gives limited knowledge. You will be always dependant of StackOverflow. 2 ) Each class has detailed class reference. Browse through entire class and you will find the method you need and also will get familiar with other capabilities of the class. Can you please elaborate following when you were looking for backgroudView.background and textLabel.text &gt; And when I looked it up in the documentation on Xcode it told me to write something that wasn’t anywhere close to what I needed 
Yeah man I learn a lot just from reading the documentation and when you're programming stuff command+click it and go to the definition and it'll show you exactly how it's been coded in the library so you can see other things inside the class/protocol/struct or whatever. I'm still learning too and by no means an expert but as I grow more comfortable with the language and syntax the more I learn from reading how the swift developers made the language and everything. stay motivated
Thank you. What I mean when I say I looked it up I mean in the help menu in Xcode. Where it says documentation and API whatever. I searched for “background color” and it had a few different backgroundColor things and it gave a line of code for each. None of them weee what I needed. What I needed, and ended up using was the UIColor Init(red green blue alpha) thing with the float points. To make a custom color.
I wish I could upvote your post for mentioning "Command + Click" keyboard shortcut.
This was expected behaviour when you posted "background color". As you were interested in background color ( property / attribute ) of backgroundView which is instance of UIView class, you should narrow down your search on documentation of UIView. Same goes with example of setting text to textLabel. Your starting point in documentation should be UILabel and then follow its superclasses if required. 
As others have stated – Force yourself to read Apple's documentation. When I was a beginner it was extremely overwhelming. However, it helps the learning process. Looking at the very top of the documentation it tells you right there that it is an instance property. I know that seeing an example is a huge help when learning; after looking at Apple's documentation you can Google "UIView backgroundColor swift example." Don't be afraid of the documentation. Once you become more advanced you will constantly be using it for reference. It is good to navigate through it now, and will help get you to the next step.
Yes, the dice roller is taking an array and picking a number at random. So I put a listener on each switch and use "let" for each switch? Also, not going programmatic at all.. lol
yeah, I'm not saying don't use playgrounds ever. I'm just saying that I prefer not to shoot my own foot.
got kids? That "spend evenings learning new technologies" thing somewhat easier once I got married and then got way way way harder once I had kids.
That property is { get set } so it can give you the current value or take a new one. The value it takes is `UIColor?` which means it is an `Optional` with a `UIColor` value. In other words, it might not have a value when you use the getter. You can use the setter to pass in a new value. New values are created through `init` methods, in this case `UIColor.init`. It’s all there, it just takes experience to know how to read it. 
That makes a little more sense. Thanks man
So, using the collection view delegates didSelectItem function, you will know what cell is selected based on the index path. You can then retrieve the cell based on the index path and look up the image property in that cell. Now you have multiple options: 1. Using segues, segue to the new controller and set the image in the destination in the prepareForSegue function 2. If using a navigation controller, you can push the new controller on to the navigation stack 3. Using presentViewController, you can show the new view controller modally.
Honestly, I don't remember all of those properties ( i don't think anyone does) except the basic ones. If I want to achieve a certain thing, I just google/stack overflow it.
Hopefully I'm just stating the obvious, but you should really not do this unless there is absolutely no way you could possibly accomplish the same task with a button.
You need to pass in the type of the object you want to decode so that JSONDecoder knows what to do with it. You can do this via generics, as you suspect. Like this ... func getData&lt;T:Decodable&gt;(_ type:T.Type, with url : String, completionHandler completion: @escaping (T)-&gt; Void){ let newURL = URL(string: url) self.session.dataTask(with: newURL!) { (data, _, _) in guard let data = data else {return } print(data) do { let jsonData = try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data) return completion(jsonData) } catch { print("decoding error") } }.resume() }
Thanks for posting this . I have similar experience while interview process 
Yeah, they really screwed up Xcode 9.3.
&gt; creating View Controller bigger than 100 lines causes headaches. So, create an actual project to test things then.
Interviews are super unfair...and incredibly difficult to conduct well. The cost of a bad hire that you can't get rid of sometimes outweighs not having an extra body on the team, and many organizations default to not hiring if there's any doubt. The person on the other side of the table is unlikely to be 1/2 as knowledgable and competent as they seem, since they've been able to cherry pick the questions, research the answers, and have everything RIGHT at their fingertips. I've been working at reasonably large tech companies for...11 years now? I've never qualified for the job as posted. I don't qualify for the job I hold now, yet I think I do good work, and there's a pretty constant string of praise from coworkers and management and promotions along the way. All that to say: Take what you feel you've been missing in each interview, and work to fill that knowledge gap. Know that a lot of this will help _ONLY_ in interviewing, as that's an art unto itself. Once you get hired at one big tech company, you're probably set. From that point on as long as you do good work, and are passingly personable, you'll have a never ending stream of people trying to pull you into whatever company they work for, and that'll make all of your interviews like 20% as difficult as what you're doing now.
Thanks /u/pnewb for such a well thought out answer... Things have been really frustrating lately and it feels like things haven't been heading anywhere... 
It's really not about working on large-scale apps, it's about learning some of the more theoretical aspects of computers and software engineering. Stuff like: - [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) - pathfinding - scheduling - space optimization - [parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) and [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science\)) - [Turing-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) - [P vs NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) - [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) - [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) - reading and writing specs - design approaches like the [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) and [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) And so much more. You get these through a formal training program or by intense, guided, self-study. The problem is that when you're one person working on an app which isn't for a real-time system or which doesn't have huge resource requirements you can get by without knowing most of these things. If you want to move on to a bigger company you'll need knowledge in most of these things. The companies know it and they are not willing to wait for you to learn it on the job. That's why they want college graduates, nearly every CS program teaches all of these concepts to some extent. If they hire someone out of a decent CS program they know that the programmer has at least been exposed to the ideas and has some degree of familiarity with them. 
my main advice it would be to Manually Run the playgrounds, then you have less chances of Xcode to hung up. I say by experience xD
Have you ever worked as a professional programmer in any language or any platform? Did you have any large projects in mind? Have you joined up with anyone to do some open source work? Can you be more specific with the "after screwing up interviews with some big tech companies," part... What part did you screw up? Do you do full stack, are you focused in any area (games, business, utility...)? Do you have any industry specific knowledge (banking, medical, financial, logistics) ? IMO, it's not always about knowing the CS (data structures, sorts, etc...) but about being a productive programmer in a team environment. Consider: if you decompiled the top 200 apps on the app store, how many would have a hand crafted sort or tree? I just don't see some of the CS stuff being practical in the day to day work of an iOS dev. Typing .sort gets it sorted without knowing how to write a qsort() from memory. Understanding the problem solving is important though. I might be up to doing a shared project if you want.
&gt; Have you ever worked as a professional programmer in any language or any platform? Yes, only for a year and half &gt; Did you have any large projects in mind? I am working on something to build up my portfolio. It's something I am trying to build the right way incorporating best practices &gt;Have you joined up with anyone to do some open source work? Have 2 pull requests merged in to swift-corelibs-foundation &gt;What part did you screw up? Was asked to write out implementations for some vastly used iOS apis, for eg hitTest &gt;Do you do full stack, are you focused in any area (games, business, utility...)? No full stack but I am well versed with firebase &gt;I might be up to doing a shared project if you want. Like I mentioned above, there is something I am working on and would love to get some code review, and feedback on the quality and style of writing code. I can give you access to my bitbucket repository if you are interested... 
Contribute to open source. The telegram app is open source of example.
This is how you know you're on a good path. You know you're missing information -- you know you know very little comparatively. FWIW I never worked on 'large scale' apps with millions of users until my current job, and that was only the past year since I graduated in 2011 (and I've been developing apps for companies since before I graduated). There are plenty of smaller, niche apps (and the companies that support them) that would likely be interested in your experience. That said, if you have knowledge gaps that retain to development in general, thats a different issue. /u/thisischemistry pointed out a good list. I think these are likely where your holes in knowledge are, not the fact that you haven't worked on a big app. Everyone, even well educated college grads, will have gaps if they never worked with another individual after graduating. Mentorship at your first few jobs is so incredibly important for this reason.
I would like to look at the code in the bitbucket. I don't know if I can help much, but I'll try.
so what
Radius is radius, if it's a constant value between all of the polygons why would it make a difference in look? I would draw them out and see.
thank you immensely good sir.
i have the same question for a long time and i have been procrastinating to post here lol. i hope someone will answer
I have a basic html page with a url that links to the specific manifest file which then downloads the app onto our phones. 
First off do you have a developer account?
Connect his phone to your computer and run the app on it. If you have dev account you can send an invite to test the app via TestFlight I think 
One method: [https://developer.apple.com/testflight/](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) Or if setup as a dev, you and setup a provisioning profile for their phone. 
If you have a paid developer account just upload a release for Testflight, and invite your friends, and if you don't,you have to connect the iPhone to your mac and run. Although setting up a developer account is a must. Even if it's not paid. If you run the application connecting to your mac and you don't have a paid account, you will have to give permission to the account as a trusted account to run the application.
Thanks for the reply. I've stepped through what you've suggested and am still having no luck. In the class containing the CollectionView I've created a variable named 'selectedImage' of type 'UIImage'. I've added the 'didSelectItemAt' delegate function and configured it as follows: &gt; override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) { &gt; // GET CELL &gt; let cell = collectionView.cellForItem(at: indexPath) as! GalleryCollectionViewCell &gt; cell.GalleryImageView.image = selectedImage &gt; &gt; // SEGUE TO TARGET VIEW CONTROLLER &gt; self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "GalleryImageViewSegue", sender: nil) &gt; } In the target ViewController I have created a 'selectedImage' variable of type 'UIImage' and assign it to the UIImageView using the following on the target: &gt; override func viewDidLoad() { &gt; super.viewDidLoad() &gt; GalleryImageView.image = selectedImage &gt; } Other relevant code in the 'source' ViewController with the CollectionView is as follows: &gt; override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell { &gt; let item = galleryItems[indexPath.row] //array of URLs to provide to Kingfisher to download and assign to cell &gt; let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "GalleryCollectionViewCell", for: indexPath) as! GalleryCollectionViewCell &gt; configureCell(cell, with: item) &gt; return cell &gt; } The referenced 'conifgureCell' method is as follows: &gt; // FUNCTION TO BUILD CELL &gt; func configureCell(_ cell: GalleryCollectionViewCell, with item: GalleryItem) { &gt; &gt; // DEFINE CELL VARIABLES &gt; let imageURL = URL(string: item.imageURL) &gt; &gt; // ASSIGN IMAGE TO CELL USING KINGFISHER &gt; cell.GalleryImageView.kf.setImage(with: imageURL) &gt; } As it stands, when I run the project and click on the CollectionViewCell it loads the target ViewController but the image doesn't appear on the target UIImage. I'm not sure if I've done the right thing in 'didSelectItemAt'. Any further suggestions?
It's not the theories, it's about tackling more difficult problems. Sometimes, some of this theoretical knowledge could be useful in solving the hard problems. But the key in the OP's post is the word "small"; small apps, small gigs. To get really good, you need to practice a little bit outside your comfort zone. Many people who take computer science still end up doing nothing but small and simple things. So the key is not the reading, it's the practice. 
&gt; I am working on something to build up my portfolio. It's something I am trying to build the right way incorporating best practices Good, but I would focus more on the functionality of the final product rather than vague notions of "best practices". Product functionality and quality first. A product of high quality (doesn't crash, responds well to user interaction, doesn't get in the way, etc) with useful functionality is a lot more impressive than a simple project that adheres to "coding best practices" but doesn't do much of anything, or worse, crashes randomly and has poor UX. 
I use Diawi: https://www.diawi.com You upload an apk, receive a URL which you can send to your friend and they can download the app. To export an apk, in Xcode change the the target to general device, click Product -&gt; Archive. Once archived, you can then go to Window -&gt; Organizer and your archive should be there to click Export. Export for ad hoc distribution. Please note: in order for it to work, you need to add your friends UUID to the provisioning profile. This is done in the Apple dev Center (not in Xcode). Your friends UUID can be found in iTunes on the summary page when connecting the phone to the computer. Once their UUID is added, you do not need to repeat this process. They take up 1 out of 100 slots for testing devices.
I agree with the on the job stuff: I've been building apps for about the same time as OP, but its been full time, on large scale apps and the computer science part of what I do is small. The engineering part (maintainability, readability, testability etc) is much bigger The top level comment is spot on about interviews though, a lot of times its a completely different skill set to actually doing the job 
Nice work! Thanks!
I read through your long story, and I have to say that you definitely should be proud. Something like this is never a waste if you’ve had such a learning experience. Yeah it sucks what happened, but if you got that far once, you know you have the potential to do it again. Also, you’re open sourcing it, which is such a cool thing to do. Good job!!
Is that "thank you immensely, good sir", "thank you, immensely good sir", or both? :p
So TestFlight works even on an unpaid dev account? If so, that sounds like the best way to go
Checkout CAGradientLayer and CAShapeLayer.
Appreciate it! Yea it sucks, but it's just as rewarding to see people get use out of it as I imagine it would have been to release :) 
I don't believe `.isSelected`. is what you are looking for. You can use an IBAction to set what happens when the button is tapped. If you want to set it programmatically, you can set the button's UIControlEvent to handle whatever you need it to do. `.touchUpInside` is the normal tap action.
You threw your button in as a label but not an action. 
Ok thabks for the advice o think I found a way to use ibaction for what I want 
Yeah, I'm gonna change it to an action and try something, thanks for pointing that out.
...where by "programming in general" you seem to mean "commercial web development".
Such an amazing story! I would advise anyone using this repo to read the whole story!! Very inspiring, sorry to hear how it ended. It was one of those ideas that as I was reading I could see why you wont so many competitions. Hate the outcome but love the idea! We play music in our office and an app like this would totally be used!
Thank you kindly for your diligence, Paul!
You mean auto layout with constraint? If thats the case , you define constraints to a UI element (eg: UIView, label, button , etc) so that the auto layout engine can know where to place the UI and how big is the UI (width and height). Auto layout engine will calculate it for different screen size and also device orientation. In storyboard/ interface builder, you can hold "Ctrl" and drag the UI element to its neighbour or parent view to define constraint. I have wrote a series of post explaining auto layout / constrains here : https://fluffy.es/making-sense-of-auto-layout/ , hope this helps!

You can check if a path contains a point. I can copypaste code when I get back to the laptop. But a search for “.contains” in that context should give you about the same answer. 
Put a breakpoint in the didSelectItem function. If it doesn't hit that means the collection view delegate has not been set. In this case, in viewDidLoad make sure you have collectionView.delegate = self and make sure your VC conforms to the UICOllectionViewDelegate protocol... If not, pm me and we can figure out a way for me to get access to your code and look at it and help you figure it out...
&gt; cell.GalleryImageView.image = selectedImage Should be the other way round, selectedImage = cell.GalleryImageView.Image .. think about it why?

lol you might actually be right
Thanks so much! It's nice to know know I might've been on to something haha
You technically can do tile overlays, but that's typically used for custom maps (but the same location). So you'd need to use some real-world dimension and draw over an existing location.
I work at a remote-only mobile dev firm, it's definitely possible. We don't hire newbie's typically though, you may want to get some real-world experience first to increase you chances of landing a remote position. 
Would you say that’s probably a three year journey? One year ish to pick up some basic skills and a couple of years in a junior role continuing to develop.
I'd say that's a reasonable timeline. My company has hired college grads but they were typically people who had built their own apps, or had already been working with companies. My advise is to hustle as hard as you can now and build your own projects in your spare time.
Will do, thanks Do you think other careers would relate better to remote work
Thanks this is what I kinda had in the back of my mind. Sure people are doing it but how feasible would it be for me from a supply and demand point of view. It looks like if remote work is my goal. I’d be better off teaching English instead (even though it doesn’t interest me)
There is also the selector approach. But I prefer storyboard tbh.

Asset Catalog Creator on the Mac Store handles it all for you. You just drop an image into it and it makes the assets for all sizes need. I use it exclusively for all of my apps. There's a pro version but the free version does everything I need it to do. Best,
Dude, you could've put a bit more effort into the question... If I'd ask "can someone explain bonds to me" in /r/investing, then I'd get downvoted to oblivion. So fucking put some work in it. What have you read? What have you tried? What is your background? What did you understand so far, and what has you stumped? Are you a beginner? Or an old fogey that finds he must make the jump?
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asset-catalog-creator/id866571115?mt=12 Looks decent
I would bet that Automator can do this
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/
IMO, there's more than just the supply/demand part. Here's the deal: becoming a professional programmer (more so for iOS) is hard to do. It's not just that you want to, it's that you have to compete agains everyone else. Past that, you have the issue of how good would you be? When I was in college, there were a LOT of students that would dig thru the trash trying to find my code. We had to print out our code to give to the professor. My code was always known to work, so people would copy it. Point: People might want to be an iOS dev, but that doesn't mean they'll be good at it. However, if you are actually good at it, or will be, then you should go for that. The worse thing would be that you waste that amount of time.
Yeah good points. I think I’d be good at it because I studied graphic design so I’d be fine from a design point of view and I work as an analyst so understand sql and vba. I’ve attended a few excel and vba classes when I was first learning and I was always a quick learner compare to the room. Although the room wasn’t a room of programmers. I think my main fear is that I sink a load of time into something that won’t get me closer towards my goal of working remotely. When I could have put that same effort towards being a better analyst or even designer.
You can use C and C++ on Android and iOS
sorry I don't do C or C++, I can find my way in Java/Swift/Kotlin/Python. I want to know if there is any difference to performance between native iOS apps and native android apps for same code. Its important for my app to be as fast as possible, platform doesn't matter.
I just find iOS interesting because I’d want to make apps that I’d actually want to use myself. But if I’m honest my main goal is to work remotely. I’ve not considered backend dev or security. Why would you recommend either of those?
If performance matters, then you should be learning C and C++. Sorry, but those are the breaks. All of those are garbage collected languages, which will cause some (usually small) performance issues in all of them. But if every millisecond matters then you probably shouldn’t be developing on a phone anyway. So how important is the performance for you really? 1 - 10 scale. If it is a 10, then shut up and learn C. If it is an 8, then any of those languages will be fine.
The operating systems, language, and compiler technology are roughly similar. The hardware isn't. Compare common iOS devices vs common Android ones: [iOS Geekbench](https://browser.geekbench.com/ios-benchmarks) [Android Geekbench](https://browser.geekbench.com/android-benchmarks) &gt; Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). iPhone 8 - Apple A11 Bionic @ 2.4 GHz Single core score: 4217 Multi-core score: 10187 Samsung Galaxy Note 8 - Samsung Exynos 8895 Octa @ 1.7 GHz Single core score: 1961 Multi-core score: 6480 The Apple devices benchmark at 2 to 4 times faster, depending on how many cores are used. This is a huge difference on computation-heavy tasks.
&gt;So how important is the performance for you really? 1 - 10 scale. 11. Every millisecond counts, the app has to beat other traders. I have taken steps to keep network latency to minimal but I am contemplating on platform. My Clients need a good UI (which is important for them) and the app needs to connect to twitter stream to parse tweets and make the decision ASAP. Thats why I was gravitating towards iOS and android. I can develop an Mac desktop native app in Swift as it has good UI support. 
Our remote teams were in Ukraine, but we were largely an Objective-C shop.
Our server developer in dotnet lived in Costa Rica.
lol thanks for your honestly. Like what though 
Please don't randomly capitalize words. You're not typing for your own convenience. You're typing for others to read.
&gt; I have wrote a series of post explaining I have written* a series of post**s*** explaining : / 
just edited, thanks for the correction!
Is a server developer the same as a database administrator? Does it work with sql databases or is it more backend web systems like php or python 
&gt; https://fluffy.es/making-sense-of-auto-layout/ , While I appreciate the work behind this, please run this through an English grammar checker. It is very hard to read.
Why not just use coordinates of the image tiles as your way of storing the locations, maybe google has something you can use for this in swift. 
Yeah I agree it’s a minefield and while I know a lot about the types of languages there really is a missing link on how that translates to industry. I suppose taking my analyst career and trying to pivot onto something better would be a more strategical option. Python would allow me to move towards being a higher paid analyst or I could double down on SQL and try and go the database route. 
Thanks. Here's some more detail into the wonders of English. To properly use the past tense of `write` in English, both of these are correct. I wrote I have written What **aren't** correct are these forms. I written I have wrote Hope this helps.
&gt; Its important It's* important it's = it is its = the next word or phrase belongs to it : /
If you aren’t doing something computationally intensive it won’t matter. Cell phone network performance will be your bottle neck, along with human reaction times. Button clicks happen pretty quickly. Don’t get fancy with your ui, avoid all images, rounded corners, animations, etc (everything fun). Having had worked with programs in similar performance constraints, the problems are usually network latency or really bad code (both). Learning to write performant code is not simple.
I would say it isn’t by design. But an outcome of choices. It’s become a meme and a joke to talk about how slow Java can be, which it can be, but in the case of Android my understanding is that the binary is a bit closer to the VM and so doesn’t have major penalties, but there are still penalties as you aren’t running right on the metal. I am not sure of Kotlin’s Memory Management system but I would hazard a guess it uses the JVM Garbage Collector. As others have said Garbage Collectors do have a negligible performance penalties. iOS has always used reference counting moving away from manually managed to automatic which is part of the Swift Compiler. There have been different philosophies on multitasking as well. Android has pushed to be more *true* multitasking which allows multiple processes to run at the same time. iOS on the other hand has followed a *faux* method; making it look like multitasking is happening, but background apps don’t get much CPU time when they are allowed it. Which allows more CPU time for the foreground app. I think core Android has pulled back on this a bit, but the vendors can still change this. With that in mind, vendors/carriers can modify the OS for additional features which may eat up resources as well. Finally as others have mentioned, hardware for Android and iOS varies greatly and even hardware within the Android ecosystem itself can vary greatly. Up until the A11 at least, iOS hardware was much better at single core performance than SOC’s used for Android which helped the idea of foreground apps having more of the CPU time. *Of course all this is from my head and I could be totally wrong.* 
If you're interested in some tips and tricks, you may find mine and /u/CodaFi's talk from AppBuilders 2018 on Monday useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGJKsp-pZPk
Thank you so much! Just added that link to my pocket list :)
True. 
For instance: Let myString = “hello” Print(“\(myString), \(myString).”) // I want “Hello, hello.” 
But wouldn't you agree that most android apps are Java, and Java runs in a VM so its going to be a little slower than compiled languages?
This was a really enjoyable talk to watch, and I'm so impressed that /u/CodaFi not only submitted the PR during the talk but that it got [merged too](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15947)!
That's pretty simple, actually. extension String { func initialUppercased() -&gt; String { return String(self.prefix(1).uppercased() + self.suffix(self.count - 1)) } } print("\(myString.initialUppercased()), \(myString).")

Premature optimization is the root of all evil.... You haven’t written anything yet, but you’re quibbling over platform performance? Both platforms are capable of being fast, and both have their pros and cons. I’ve worked on trading apps on both platforms, and they are both capable as far as mobile devices go. Your issues will be with your skills and network latency, before any platform-wide performance.
And, on the rare occasion when they do have good content (like some WWDC videos), using them as reference is just a pain in the ass. And, using things as reference is mostly where I'm at.
Sure, as a pointer to new technology and ideas they can be great. Using them as a reference? No way! Even as a course I'd much rather have the text than a video.
You keep saying "same code". So, unless you're going Xamarin, ReactNative, etc. (which will cost you milliseconds), you're stuck with C/C++.
Not necessarily, a VM can be highly-optimized and code on it can run pretty close to native code speed. You have to be careful with certain things like garbage collection and such but we've come a long way since the old days of slow VM.
I wouldn't put too much faith in that website. If you look at the source code for some of the worst offenders there you'll find they can be written in an extremely naive and un-optimized manner. With a bit of work the performance differences would be greatly reduced. I'm not a Java expert so I can't speak much on wringing the last bit of speed out of a Java implementation but I do know Swift and the Swift code on that site varies greatly in speed optimization.
That comes straight from the wikipedia on Java performance. I'm a Java programmer. I can tell you that it could stand to be a lot faster. The VM is a lot of code, and something has to run that code. Running some code is slower than running no code. For performance, I'll take running on the metal every time.
I'm not saying that running in a VM will be every bit as fast as running without one but it's not a simple cut-and-dry matter that it will always be slower. Write your program in a VM, find out the slow bits, re-write them in an optimized manner. If this means you need to write a bit of native code and call it from the VM then that's what you do. I'd do the same in any language, including C. Although languages and compilers have gotten very good about producing great low-level code from a higher-level language there's still cases where hand-tuning a bit of assembly will give you a good boost in performance.
As a Swift coder, you should be glad you don't have to run on a VM :) Thats one of the things I like about Swift.
Right, I'm not advocating that we should all give up VM based languages, after all, I code in Java professionally. I'm not saying it doesn't have its value. I'm saying that for pure speed, a VM gets in the way a bit. 
Makeappicon.com Or Iconizer on the Mac App Store. Both are good. Iconizer is a bit more versatile 
thanks, fixed it. 
As somebody who has worked in cross-platform commercial game engines and needed to care deeply about performance, as a general rule of thumb, we avoid the JVM as much as possible. Standard disclaimers, when you talk about real world performance for your app, you need to understand what's really going on and what your real bottlenecks are. For example, it won't matter a damn if your CPU code runs 100x faster on one platform vs. another if your application is completely bottlenecked doing I/O. (And I/O in high performance situations can even mean something taken for granted like reading from RAM, meaning L1/L2 cache misses means you stall hundreds of CPU cycles to read a few bytes from RAM from main memory.) Disclaimers aside, the JVM is painful because garbage collection is very unpredictable. Garbage collection is a complex topic, but at the end of the day, if you care about low latency, you are usually better off avoiding it entirely. Additionally, there are multiple implementations of the JVM. The Sun/Oracle implementation is highly optimized compared to Android. Android uses their own written from scratch and in my experience has a lot of performance pitfalls. Some of this was necessary because there is far less RAM on mobile devices, but there are a lot of other issues as a consequence. So those who are serious about performance on Android, tend to bypass Java as much as possible and use the NDK which is designed for native code (primarily C/C++, but can be used for other things, including Swift). That said, you are writing a networking app. Ultimately, you will be going through the networking stack of the platform. Again, back to understanding your bottlenecks, you might be I/O bound all the time or limited by the platform's networking stack available to you. In the end, iOS/Android may not make a difference. Java/Swift may not make a difference. But hardware might make the difference. ISP might make the difference. Kernel differences in the network stack might make the difference. That said, I personally would approach it by writing it natively using either C or Swift, but writing it in a portable manner so I could run it on both iOS and Android. (Android Swift is still raw, so it takes some care and planning if you use Swift.) 
&gt; You haven’t written anything yet, but you’re quibbling over platform performance? Because I have limited resources and only want to target the fastest platform among android/ios?
The decision should be based on what you know you can do well and what the job market wants. IMO, iOS is too new. I can see a future where many businesses will have internal iOS devs for their own in\-house apps much like they do now for Web and PC based apps, but I don't see that happening right now. Once the iOS casino calms down, things should change, but even then, there'll be a TON of iOS devs out there, just like when DotCom crashed back in 2000.
Apparently I'm a bit wrong in that you can't turn ARC off like the flip of a switch for your entire codebase. However, you can certainly mitigate a bunch of the overhead associated with it. This is done through the use of [`Unmanaged`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unmanaged). [Friday Q&amp;A 2017-08-11: Swift.Unmanaged](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-08-11-swiftunmanaged.html)
&gt; I have choice of Android or Mac. I know Swift compiles to machine code whereas Android(which I am planning to write in Kotlin) runs in JVM ? No, it doesn't. I don't know where you got your architecture knowledge, but Android (at least since version 5, several years ago) doesn't run apps in a JVM. All binaries are AOT compiled. &gt; So relatively speaking for same code base, is Android app slower than iOS as apps runs in JVM? For android assume user has top of line Samsung device. They have different CPU speeds and quantities and functional units, different languages and runtimes and standard libraries, different RAM sizes and speeds ... there's no equal comparison to be made here. It's only in the world of clickbait headlines that you can say one is faster than the other for every task. &gt; I am trying to develop an network application for which speed is very important. Every millisecond counts as it will be used in online trading. Then tell them to get a desktop computer, because it'll beat either one.
First make sure it has isUserInteractionEnabled = true. Then add a tap gesture recognizer on the image. This should call a function to min/max the size.. image.frame = view.frame for full size and for small size just do a cgrect of the old size. You probably also want to do a uiview animation so it looks more natural.
Obvious to see for me now. Should be the other way because as it is it’s setting the cell image properly to equal the empty ‘selectedImage’ property. I’m clearing the image property instead of storing it. I’ll switch it around shortly when I’m back at my computer and see how it goes. Thanks for the pointer!
I've just added a trial feature in version 0.6.0. Simply install and you're good to go! Docs here: https://peripheryapp.com/documentation/getting-started/
Hello, yep, just switched them around and it works a treat, thank you! :D The code I pasted earlier is code that I hadn't done yet, but wrote based on your first reply. I was kind of hoping for some code examples when people replied but was also happy to be given the 'gist' of the right direction to take, like what you provided, so I could have a go at writing the code myself. I really appreciate your advice and time, thank you.
It´s quite easy. If you are working with the storyboard just find the tap gesture recogniser in the object library (same as where you find the uiview and stuff) and drag it on top of the image. Then you can select the this new added recogniser and control drag it like you would drag a button to your code and create an action. If you do it programmatic then go then just do this image..addGestureRecognizer(UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(setImageSize))) and add a function @objc func setImageSize()
OK, so I brute-forced this a bit because it seems there's not much in the way of Apple-supplied API for custom-shaped gradient curves. There may be better ways to accomplish this but I went for the quick-and-easy solution for now: import UIKit /** Maps values in the range 0..1 to 0..1 using an exponential curve. */ func curve(_ value: CGFloat, rate: CGFloat) -&gt; CGFloat { precondition(rate &gt; 0.0) precondition(value &gt;= 0.0) guard value &lt; 1.0 else { return 1.0 } return 1 - exp(rate + rate / (value - 1.0)) } class GradientView: UIView { var shape: UIBezierPath? override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) { guard let shape = shape else { return } // Draw successively smaller paths with a new color let steps = Int(max(shape.bounds.maxX, shape.bounds.maxY)) let stepFactor = 1.0 / CGFloat(steps) let shapeMid = CGPoint(x: shape.bounds.midX, y: shape.bounds.midY) for i in 0..&lt;steps { guard let copy = shape.copy() as? UIBezierPath else { break } // scale and center let scale = CGFloat(steps - i) * stepFactor copy.apply(CGAffineTransform(scaleX: scale, y: scale)) let copyMid = CGPoint(x: copy.bounds.midX, y: copy.bounds.midY) copy.apply(CGAffineTransform(translationX: shapeMid.x - copyMid.x, y: shapeMid.y - copyMid.y)) // generate color and set it as fill color let colorScale = curve(CGFloat(i) * stepFactor, rate: 1.0) UIColor(red: colorScale, green: colorScale, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0).setFill() // fill the shape copy.fill() } } }
Ok, thanks!
Get over yourself. 
If the object in the main/parent context is dirty (i.e. you’ve set the active property to false), the propagated changes from the child context will be “hidden”. In other words, the “saved” value will be the new value from the child context’s changes, but the dirty value won’t be changed which is the value that will be returned by the active accessor.
You should have an accessor called “addTo(parent’s name)” in your NSManagedObject subclass. I found this eliminated headaches of getting children connnected to their parent. And it was like “wow, I wasted a lot of time and coding when I could have just used this”. 
This was really nice, good job you guys! Are there any good recommended resources you could point to for learning C++? u/CodaFi mentioned that LLVM C++ is also a bit different, so some pointers on that would be great too
You want your app to slide in from the bottom rather than zoom in from the icon? Is that what your hoping to achieve? It's not possible.
LLVM has piles of documentation on the subject of their subset of C++. The root of that [is here](http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html). It wont teach you C++ though. I recommend reading that document and going to find some common components like the frontend, the parser, or SIL, etc. and seeing how it’s applied. I learned C++ from reading Bjarne’s book and the standard which I recognize is not going to work for everybody. If you’re more of a visual/auditory learner, then talks at BoostCon/CppCon, C++ Now, and on MSDN are a very valuable open resource. If you’re more of an experiential learner, I recommend struggling with a [Starter Bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7445?filter=10488&amp;jql=project%20%3D%20SR%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20component%20in%20(EMPTY%2C%20CodeCompletion%2C%20Compiler%2C%20%22Standard%20Library%22%2C%20Tooling)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20StarterBug%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) and picking up a fee for C++ as you go along.
Well, that's... not how I thought it would work. I was thinking that Core Data has a problem with Bools, as I haven't had trouble with any other variable. Is there anything I can do in this case? Or should I just resign and change the Bool to an Int64 and use 0 an 1 instead?
Don't really think it would be wise to post any code. Or useful, for that matter, it's a convoluted mess there. Everything else in the table seems to update ok, except the Bool value.
Will research this when I can. How does it help, exactly?
Its been awhile since I worked on this part and I’m more of a hack in that I can get things done but may not explain it well. But this wires it all up to the parent correctly. Trying to save the child as you would the parent, they must be in the same context and I remember there was some other issue as well. But using the accessor keeps it all happy and it’s easier. You just addTo and save the parent.
There must exist a root view controller to present one modally. So like others have suggested, make the initial VC look like the launch screen.
I'm a bit confused since you say you're not looking to support iPad but then you're asking questions. I'll assume you mean you do want to support iPad. There are several approaches, IMO that you can take, and which one you take will depend of the type of app you have. One of the things you could do is use a split view controller. I believe the Settings app, the Mail app and the Messages app all use these. Basically if you have a navigation controller in your app, the split view controller would have the root view controller on the left, and the rest of the stack on the right. It also has some automatic behaviors when the iPad is rotated. See more in the [UISplitViewController documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisplitviewcontroller). Another approach, which is a bit more involved is using Auto Layout and Size Classes. The use of these allows you to lay your view out differently depending on the size of the screen. Something else you can do, which I've never done previously, is have different view controllers and storyboards (if you're using them) for iPad vs iPhone, where some iPad views might contain a combination of a couple of iPhone screens. If you're using MVVM, this might not be the worst idea, but I'd probably recommend against going this route regardless. Without knowing more, this is all I can tell you for now. I'm happy to follow up if you give me more info on what you're thinking!
Well, ok, I'll try this first. I was going to change the Bool to an Int64 as a last resort, but I might as well try this too. Thanks a lot :D
Check out the website Udemy They have some awesome swift beginner and advanced programming courses for a range of different prices and projects including some are free lessons! 
I actually don't understand something if you have the time to reply.. in func getData&lt;T:Decodable&gt;(_ type:T.Type, .......) I understand that we're passing in a &lt;T: that complies with Decodable&gt; but why are we specifying T.Type ? what is T.Type? Decodable? 
This is a good start, after you get that working, you may want to look into UIScrollView (which can honestly be a pain to set up) for being able to pan around an image that doesn't fit on the screen.
You could redesign your UI to use fractions of the device’s screen size when setting the sizes of your views.
Thanks for the reply! Just ordered A Tour of C++, this should be fun
I get an error saying use of local variable setimageSize before its declaration. I added a tap gesture recognizer and linked it to the image view. I made sure to enable user interaction. 
I don't know of a specific problem with boolean values. I was just looking around for some samples but I've got so many damn tutorials and projects I can't seem to find any right now. This is what I would do: check the code that is generated from Xcode, the code they tell you to never modify because if you change the table it has to be regenerated. See if maybe that code is before any table changes. I'd be looking for something where Swift treats a bool differently from how ObjC treats it. Last I remember all of CD was in ObjC and I'm not sure if Swift's bool value is the same as ObjC's bool value. If everything else is working, maybe see if you read it as a 0 or 1 instead of a bool, then convert. I can't think of an easy way to see the raw SQLite value, maybe download an SQLite browser app, they're always handy anyways. One other test is to write a quick ObjC app just to access the file and update a record. I don't see why that can't be written inside of your Swift app, just all a single ObjC module and add 1 record, see what it does. What happens if you don't update, but add new? Is it the case that you can't ever update the value, or is it only when there is a record being updated?

convert the string to a numeric and do this: let myString = String(format: "%02d", 1) or find the string version of padding with zeros. Here's one that's an extension, I think the above one should have a string version, I just don't know all the formats. extension String { func padLeft (totalWidth: Int, with: String) -&gt; String { let toPad = totalWidth - self.characters.count if toPad &lt; 1 { return self } return "".padding(toLength: toPad, withPad: with, startingAt: 0) + self } } for myInt in 1...3 { print("\(myInt)".padLeft(totalWidth: 2, with: "0")) } https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25566581/leading-zeros-for-int-in-swift 
Adding new works. It's a case of updating the value.
Is optional a data type? I considered it to be a "type of type". Meaning that an int can be optional or not optional. Kinda like Weak/Strong. Weak isn't really a data type like a String/Date/Int/Long/Array.
[`Optional](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional) is a type, it's an `enum`: enum Optional&lt;T&gt; { case none case some(T) } 
Can it stand alone as a data type? Meaning that you can have a type that is nothing but an optional? I use the example of weak/strong they are modifiers to other data types. You can have a String data type and that String can be optional or not. You can't have a String that's also a Date. Date is not a modifier for String, but optional can be.
Ok, so you can add a new record in Swift and it has whatever value you want (True or False). However, when you change (update) it doesn't take the change and it doesn't report an error? I'm trying to make sure that this isn't a Swift/ObjC issue. Meaning you know as a fact that you can add a record in Swift and use BOTH True and False and it works... If that's the case, this is interesting because Swift works and then it doesn't work. I can dig up on of my tutorials and write a quick test, but I have a feeling it'll work. I haven't heard of this being a problem.
 import Foundation let dates = ["11/1/17", "11/01/17", "10/2/17", "10/02/17", "11/1/1917"] let formatter = DateFormatter() formatter.dateFormat = "MM/dd/yy" let sorted = dates.compactMap { formatter.date(from: $0) }.sorted().map { formatter.string(from: $0) } print(sorted) // ["11/01/17", "10/02/17", "10/02/17", "11/01/17", "11/01/17"] 
Part of the problem is that you're looking for iOS jobs in Germany. iOS is a casino language, meaning that investing buy into iOS apps on the hope they'll strike gold. It's not the same as getting a regular programming job because iOS isn't broadly used in business as a dev platform like web or other platforms. Once mobile gets to the point where businesses hire internal iOS devs for in house, full time work, the job market if iOS will start to spread out. It's kinda like saying you want a job as an actor, you'd want to go to LA for that. You want a job as a ski instructor, you have to go where there are ski resorts... You want to be an iOS dev you got to be near a mobile tech hub.
It's a generic, just like `Array`, `Dictionary`, and many other types. Any generic is a "stand alone" type (that's kind of a meaningless distinction) because the type includes the specialization. That's how generics work. It's 100% different than keywords such as `weak` and `strong`.
So I can declare an Array called myArray and add data to myArray. Can I declare an Optional call myOptional and add data to myOptional?
Sure. let myArray = Array&lt;Int&gt;([5]) let myOptional = Optional&lt;Int&gt;(5) 
Make one!
Kiddin, check this out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29500227/getting-error-no-such-module-using-xcode-but-the-framework-is-there
What do you mean? Moltin was installed using cocoapods; it’s in my pod file. I added a bridging header, including #import &lt;Moltin/Moltin.h&gt; but as I said the import does not work. Thanks.
That was the first one I checked, I tried those solutions including setting framework paths to SRCROOT
Pretty slick. Was there any exploration of using custom operators to automate the Function wrapping? Not that I love custom operators, but it would get around the inability to extend function types.
I originally included a postfix operator that promoted a Swift function a `Function` but ultimately decided to omit it in favor of the more verbose initializer. One of my intentions for the framework is to bring functional operations to Swift without the intimidating overhead of learning new operators (e.g. introducing `&gt;&gt;&gt;` for forward composition), so despite the syntactic convenience of an operator for wrapping, I elected against it. In practice, having overloaded methods that take Swift functions make wrapping reasonably unintrusive.
There are no `Optional` or `Array` by themselves. They are objects defined by their generic components. So an `Array&lt;Int&gt;` is like a `struct` that holds an `Int`, the `Int` is part of both of them. Effectively these are the same (not in actual implementation, but in concept): let foo = Array&lt;Int&gt;([2, 3]) struct ArrayInt { let first let second } let bar = ArrayInt(2, 3) They are both objects that hold 2 `Int` values. There's no need to treat them as anything special other than the semantics of how to act on those values.
Interesting, never thought of optionals that way. I always just considered it a modifier of other data types, not as a data type itself.
Yes, it's actually functioning amazingly well, I said that the code works fine in the post. What doesn't look right? Do you want the source code?
The problem there is you have a return in the middle of that scope. The code from there to the end of the scope will never be visited.
&gt; data else { &gt; completion(nil, .invalidData) &gt; return &gt; do { A curly brace got lost in the process when I was pasting. The code functions fine as I said before. I'm just asking about the very specific question of hardcoding array brackets around a generic variable T
Optional Int and Optional String are more similar to each other than Int is to anything else.
Here's a simplified example of what you're doing. This works just fine. If it isn't working with your code then what error is being returned? import Foundation func foo&lt;T: Codable&gt;(_ type: T.Type, value: Data) -&gt; T? { return try? JSONDecoder().decode(type, from: value) } let test = ["test"] if let data = try? JSONEncoder().encode(test), let value = foo([String].self, value: data) { print(value) // ["test"] } 
Here is a link to a pastebin, with all relevant pieces of code. https://pastebin.com/QYhKJrDz So this code works fine for when I use this apiURL jsonURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" with the jsonUser structure and I also hardcode @escaping ([T]?, NetworkingClientErrors?) and try JSONDecoder().decode([T].self, from: data) But when I want to pull an achievement with wowAch structure with at this url for just the title "https://us.api.battle.net/wow/achievement/2144?locale=en_US&amp;apikey=wh7sqpen5a5gps5sp9mjvp7s9tnrtbsf" the code throws me my .jsonConversionFailure enum error because I hardcoded it to expect an array when it's just a single object. My question is, is there a way I can modify this function so that if the URL happens to have an array it can give me back an array, and if it happens to be a single object, have it pass me back an object
I don't have it, sorry. I updated the simplified code to include a completion handler and it's all still working: import Foundation func foo&lt;T: Codable&gt;(_ type: T.Type, value: Data, completionHandler completion: @escaping (T?, Bool?) -&gt; Void) -&gt; T? { guard let test = try? JSONDecoder().decode(type, from: value) else { return nil } completion(test, true) return test } let test = ["test"] if let data = try? JSONEncoder().encode(test), let value = foo([String].self, value: data, completionHandler: { print($0, $1) }) { print(value) // Results: // // Optional(["test"]) Optional(true) // ["test"] } So where are the errors in your code, what's the result? Any errors, crashes? I think we might need more info, what's posted here seems to be ok.
No don’t do it 
Ahh, there's the problem! It will only decode the type you put in. So if there's a different type in there it won't work. When you call it, the method call determines the type - not the data. When you use the first URL you should pass in the type `[jsonUserObject].self`, with the second URL you should use `wowAch.self`. I see in your code that you're using the second type, how are you calling the first? 
I'm not asking about what's wrong with your code, just what errors are being returned when you're using it. The types `[Int]` and `Int` are completely different. `Int` is not just a special case where the data is at `[Int](0)`. If you try to decode a `[Int]` but pass in `Int.self` to your method it won't work at all.
Or maybe I don’t understand what you’re asking me? What do you think? Am I expecting too much? Why can’t I just use wowAch.self and keep the function as is with it expecting [T]
No, this signature should be just fine: public func getData&lt; T : Codable&gt;(asObject type : T.Type, with url : apiURL.RawValue, completionHandler completion : @escaping ([T]?, NetworkingClientErrors?) -&gt; Void) Call it like I have in the post above. I edited in the proper way to call it for each type.
You don't need to have `[T]`, keep it as `T` but when the JSON values are returned as an array you need to pass the actual type in as an array, like `[jsonUserObject]`
 jsonDL.getData(asObject: wowAch.self, with: apiURL.blizAchURL.rawValue) { (jsonData, error) in print(jsonData, error) } here is console log button press nil Optional(networkingProject.NetworkingClientErrors.jsonConversionFailure)
There was an extraneous `[T]` in there, I changed it to `T`. As I said, call it like `[jsonUserObject]` when the URL will return an array and like `wowAch` when it doesn't return an array.
so far success! jsonDL.getData(asObject: [jsonUserObject].self, with: apiURL.jsonURL.rawValue) { (jsonData, error) in print(jsonData, error) }
Exactly. For your code, when the JSON data returns a JSON array you call it like that. When it returns a single object call it without the square brackets.
Hmm.. Thanks a lot. I guess there is no way for me to program it to detect and based on the detection to return an array or single object?
Yes, there are ways to do that but it's usually not worth it. You should know the API you're calling into and know the types you're getting out of it. Dynamically changing types like this is often a bad idea in Swift.
I knew that I didn't have to hardcore it to accept arrays and I was just doing something wrong syntactically. 
Well I'm still a beginner and learning and I've just been putting a lot of effort into making json downloader that I can use for basically any project I want to work on in the future. I guess you're right and it makes sense. Thanks for all the help. 
what about my use of the DispatchQueue was that a good spot to put it in so that it wouldn't slow down the main application if there was a view depending on this information?
Harry Potter's gay ass cousin. And are your eyes two different colors? Seriously though two different colors? Did your mum get some DNA scrambled up during the gangbang you were created at?
Glad to help. The structure of the code is pretty good and it seems to work cleanly. It could be rearranged a little bit to be even cleaner. Changing this: if httpResponse.statusCode == 200 { guard let data = data else { completion(nil, .invalidData) return } do { let jsonData = try JSONDecoder().decode([T].self, from: data) completion(jsonData, nil) } catch { completion(nil, .jsonConversionFailure) return } } else { print("status code not OK... Status code : \(httpResponse.statusCode)") } Into this: guard httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else { print("status code not OK... Status code : \(httpResponse.statusCode)") } guard let data = data else { completion(nil, .invalidData) return } guard let jsonData = try? JSONDecoder().decode([T].self, from: data) else { completion(nil, .jsonConversionFailure) return } completion(jsonData, nil) Now your method exits are either in `guard` statements or are at the very end of the method. Less nesting of scopes and it's easier to read. Notice that I'm using `try?` instead of `try`. This is good because you were throwing away the exception message anyways, `try?` returns an `Optional` that you can test against.
It looked decent to me, I'd have to really give the code a whirl to test it out but I didn't see anything wrong with it.
Noted, didn’t even think of that. That’s pretty awesome. I’m sure it’s just because you copied the code from the OP but just to be sure, but you suggested that I switch the code from .decode([T] to .decode(T) thanks again man
Hah, yep. It's late and I keep doing that! I'll correct it in my reply.
Nice, thanks a lot. Thanks for taking the time out to help
Nah it’s fine just wanted to make sure, have a good night!
Sure thing. Good luck! And thanks for pointing out that Battle.net API. I knew it was out there somewhere but didn't know they made it so easily accessible. Might come in handy some day.
Yeah league of legends api is the same way basically. Thanks for pointing out that I wrote my function correctly and I just needed to pass in the correct object/data structure for it to work. Might come in handy some day. 
Why is this a failable initializer? init?(date: String, shotsTaken: Int) In fact, there's an autogenerated memberwise initializer if you don't declare any initializers: init(date: String, shotsTaken: Int) `NSDate` might not be `Codable` but `Date` works just fine and is a much better way to store the value than in a `String`. Take a look at this code: import Foundation struct ShotCycle: Codable { var date: Date var shotsTaken: Int init(date: Date, shotsTaken: Int) { self.date = date self.shotsTaken = shotsTaken } init?(date: String, shotsTaken: Int) { let formatter = DateFormatter() formatter.dateFormat = "MM/dd/yy" guard let date = formatter.date(from: date) else { return nil } self.init(date: date, shotsTaken: shotsTaken) } } let shotCycles = [ShotCycle(date: "04/1/18", shotsTaken: 15), ShotCycle(date: "04/11/18", shotsTaken: 22)] .compactMap { $0 } print(shotCycles) // [ShotCycle(date: 2018-04-01 04:00:00 +0000, shotsTaken: 15), // ShotCycle(date: 2018-04-11 04:00:00 +0000, shotsTaken: 22)] 
Let me look into types again... but did the kermit the frog meme work or no?
yes I was going to say name 4 types... but that's a bit vague: this is source - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/swift_data_types.htm
&gt; https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/swift_data_types.htm I guess I was wrong, Optional is a data type, I always thought it was a modifier for a data type.
That's exactly why I believe it to be a Swift issue. Another clue would be that ObjC's Core Data Bools would just be generated as NSNumbers, whereas Swift's Core Data Bools are generated as Bools.
So the 2 Questions for each of these videos are: 1. Did you learn anything? 2. Were you amused? If 1. does not succeed were you at least 2?
What’s wrong with names.lazy.map(..).map(..)?
from the readme: &gt; This seems nice, but we've introduced an inefficiency: in mapping over the array twice, we unnecessarily create an intermediate array. Here are a couple potential solutions: &gt; - Make the function calls together in a single map. &gt; - Use the lazy property. &gt; Option 1 quickly becomes a parenthetical nightmare, and option 2 often hurts readability because of the need to subsequently call the Array initializer. Function composition can solve this problem elegantly
I’m asking why you consider the lazy example less readable than the proposed solution. Side bye side, lazy seems much clearer to me.
I'm not OP, just pointing out they'd addressed it in the beginning my personal opinion is lazy seems less clear and also introduces other types which can complicate things 
I wouldn't be that hard to make an app that just wrote out a record and looked at the SQLite tables to see how Swift bools are stored vs ObjC. Because Core Data uses SQLite under the hood, an SQLite browser should give the answer.
I used UISplit View controller in my recent universal app. Basically, split view controller has two components, one is mater view controller and detailed view controller. In iPhone view, you only see the master vc, when you tap it will take you to the detailed one (assuming you have nav controller in place) In iPad, you will se both vc components side by side and also you can select the first item from the left master vc so that right detailed does show empty. Hope this helps!
I've been spending a bit of time reading about functional composition so maybe I'm biased the other way, i think they could update the example to have something like this to show where it might be less tidy: let nameLengths = names.lazy.map(lengthFromString) doSomething(withArrayOfInts: nameLengths) //compiler error doSomething(withArrayOfInts: Array(nameLengths)) //fine 
This example isn’t using lazy correctly so it doesn’t benefit from it. The problem is that it’s recreating the array. Maybe the problem is a misunderstanding of how lazy should be used. I’d give an example but I’m on my cell and it’s just too difficult to really do this subject justice. 
yeah i’ll admit i don’t have much experience using lazy, i was just following the example you gave
That's the thing, there is no moltin,swift file in my pods folder. There is a Moltin folder, containing a moltin.h file. Is that the problem? I have v3.02 installed.
We try to explain the motivation for function composition in the README to Overture, a library that inspired FunctionKit: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-overture/blob/readme-tweaks/README.md#motivation The short of it: function composition is far more general than loop fusion and provides the same benefit (and compiles more quickly: "lazy" is notorious for making expressions difficult for the compiler to type-check). Thinking in terms of composition also makes it easier to extract, reuse, and build up logic from small units outside the calls to "map". Overture takes a top-level function approach over wrapper types, which means code like this: xs.map(incr).map(square).map(String.init) Becomes this: xs.map(pipe(incr, square, String.init)) A benefit of bundling logic using composition is that you can easily extract and reuse it elsewhere. let computeAndStringify = pipe(incr, square, String.init) xs.map(computeAndStringify) computeAndStringify(x)

Thanks Stephen! It was mentioned upthread, but I'll say it again—for anyone interested in the application of functional programming concepts in Swift, Stephen and Brandon over at [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co) are doing awesome stuff.
I've just reworked the README to focus more on the concept of composition rather than just its use with `map`—hopefully it's clearer now.
You can find it within few hours.. App store now takes only few hours to review if you're lucky.. otherwise it may take upto 10 days.. Although I have 3 of my apps reviewed/approved within a day.
Very cool! What kind of app did you make?
It's a pretty simple app. It's just an app that lets users see the ranking of all songs of a particular artist in a tableview in one tab. The second tab generates two random song names of the artist and the users pick which song they like out of the two. I implemented an Elo rating system to rank every song to allow users to see a 'normalized' rating instead of a typical ranking system based on number of streams

no problem. I created an app that does this but with a 2.5 min buffer: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wyndr/id1244354719?mt=8 Took me forever to figure it out as i didn't have any core audio experience.
Thank you! 
Probably a good idea to post some code, tell us what technologies you are using, that sort of thing. Don't post images of code, post text instead. With text people can copy-paste it and try it out to understand what's going on.
That’s not an array, it’s a tuple. The Boolean would be accessed something like example[“key”].2, something along those lines? Or something like let foo: (Int, String, Bool) = example[“key”] Then just access the Boolean with “foo.2”. Sorry for the formatting, on mobile. 
No book will ever truly teach you to program. You need to pick a simple project and just start. It’ll be painful to begin with, but only once you actually have a problem to solve will books begin to help you as a reference.
I'm not sure. I'd say play with it to start
This is exactly what I need but I need much longer time frames. Any idea how you would go about making this work for an hour or even 24? Maybe save compressed files of 15 min in length and once the file count gets to 4 delete the oldest and start a new one.
Are you opening the workspace that cocoapods creates?
Dont forget you can name tuple members for better readability. let foo: (name: String, age: Int, isProgrammer: Bool) So you can access the Boolean with foo.isProgrammer
One more suggestion; if you have let tuple = ("aValue", 24, true) you can do let (foo, bar, baz) = tuple to get all three values into separate variables.
thanks a lot! Can I use your code &amp; update my blog post?
Cocoapods generates a shellscript which is placed in your project directory, in Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-YourProjectName. It's name is "Pods-ProjectName-frameworks.sh". You can find the exact name in Xcode: go to your target, go to build phases, and open the build phase "Embed Pods Frameworks". Search for "basename -s", not "basename --s". See if you can put in some extra lines that echo some more details.
Absolutely 
Cocoapods is for kids. Use Carthage.
Neat. Basically an adaptation of Haskell's `newtype`?
Sure thing
Honestly, this sounds like an overkill for a simple problem. It obscures what should otherwise be clear and straight forward code.
&gt; The following compiles, runs, and even reads reasonably at a glance: &gt; &gt; let subscription = fetchSubscription(byId: user.id) When's the last time anyone here saw such a mistake? I'm not sure this has ever happened to me. &gt; We've prevented a couple serious bugs at compile time! Yes, but so? Hanenberg's 2010 paper found (among other things) that programmers spent less time fixing their bugs in dynamically typed languages than they did placating the type checker in statically typed languages -- and the end results were just as good. It's true you've moved the issue from run-time to compile-time, but doing so neither increased reliability, nor decreased development time. At least Swift's type system has a purpose: it's designed to allow the compiler to generate fast executables. This library is pursuing type safety simply for the sake of type safety.
Ok I just put the code up there. Tell me if there is any other code you want.
I assume you are using SceneKit. You are probably best off properly setting the scale mode rather than doing the scaling yourself. I assume you’d want `.aspectFit`, this keeps the aspect ratio of your original scene but adds some letter boxing so the scene can fit. It also keeps all of the physics of your original scene without any worries about scaling them. [SKScene.scaleMode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skscene/1519562-scalemode)
Finally someone else that is willing to point out that "type safety" is a false idol.
So right now I am using SpriteKit for all of the game objects. However, my scene is an SKScene. Can I still use .aspectFit for that? Also, I did get the speed to 'scale' by doing bullet.physicsBody?.velocity and directly setting a velocity to the object itself. I imagine that if I keep using this method of scaling that I am using right now, other problems are bound to occur so it would be way better if I could just set these all to the regular values and just doing .aspectFit. 
Yup! Ideally Swift will get a `newtype` in the future that makes this a bit simpler (no need to create a tag), but it's nice that we have this till then!
We've been using Tagged in the Point-Free code base for months and it's regularly gated bugs we may have committed otherwise :) It's also just one extra line per "Id" type and conditional conformance makes it pretty ergonomic to use, so the minimal investment seems worth it to us! If you don't write bugs like this, feel free to avoid the lib :)
RawRepresentable is also a nice solution that ships with Swift. Tagged just makes this stuff a bit more ergonomic and easy to use/test since you get equatable, codable, etc., for free.
assuming this course is not for straight beginners? I have the most basic understanding of coding from an old visual basic course in the early 2000s, but haven't used it since. would I be able to follow and learn this?
Ha, it's only 100 lines of code or so, mostly proxying conditional conformance. You could copy and paste it into your codebase if you're worried about a dependency :)
This looks very useful and a level of safety I've wanted in languages for a long time. The more errors discovered at compile-time the better. Next I want arbitrary restraints on both variables and parameters (min/max values, string length, etc). You can do them in the setters, but then every method winds up requiring try statements. 
Some languages, like Idris, allow you to specify this in the type system! It's called dependent types and it's super neat. Chris Lattner mentioned something like this being added to a future version of Swift.
I'm glad you figured it out... Learning by discovery is far better than just asking for code and copy pasting it....
Pics or GTFO
It's called Xcode, not xcode.
Yes.
C++ has constraints and concepts, but I haven't looked into them deep enough to know if they are only compile-time checks or also runtime. And, of course, the syntax is hard. http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints
You just need to be creative and add something else that your app can do. They think it's boring, useless and doesn't offer anything to the App Store or its users. Just because your code is doing something differently, it doesn't really matter if the user interaction/what the user can do isn't cool or unique. 
The issue that jumps out me is that you’re covering just one musical artist. That severely limits the appeal of your app within the iOS user base. How comprehensively does this app cover that one artist? Why aren’t other artists included? How often will a user look at your app after downloading it? Does this appeal to users that listen to other genres of music? I think you should examine what you’re trying to achieve (both the promotion of one artist in particular, and succeeding at the app review process in order to launch an app), and try a new approach that satisfies both of these goals rather than just one.
There's also the problem that C++ concepts aren't yet standardized, though they are due to (finally) be in C++20.
&gt;tried but not working!
 I have seen a few errors in some of their docs as well. 
One problem here is really that you’re not using the functionality of the phone to do anything interesting. This could easily be a website, and would probably be better as one for wider appeal to your user base of “people who like The Weekend”. What they’re looking for to fix this issue are phone-specific features. Like hooking into the Apple Music API to allow users to actually listen to the songs they’re supposed to be rating. The other problem is usefulness. Once you’ve performed all possible matches , what can you do? I imagine you can’t rate matches again (skewing the results), or wouldn’t even if you could (unless you *want* to skew the results), leaving the only reason you’d open the app being viewing the latest rankings. Maybe if you could select another artist/band and do the same for their tracks. Or feature a new/different artist every week. Anything to extend the useful life of the app.
Thank you for your input. These are all valid concerns and i agree with you fully but check out the app called "either.io". this app, although a lot more aesthetically pleasing than my app, it seems to fall into all the categories you mentioned and it still successfully got into the app store
I don’t agree with your assessment. Without even downloading the app, based on the screenshots alone, Either has plenty of functionality and reusability. Users can login, submit their own questions (for a potential—in theory—unlimited number of matches), and post comments about any match so they can have a discussion about it.
Just did! Thanks!!

Fix what they sid was wrong.
“Just don’t lose”. Kk got it. Thx fam it solved my probs 
Apple rejects submissions often and inconsistly. Add something minor then resubmit. You'll have a different reviewer who will probably reject you for something completely different. Rinse and repeat-- AFAIK there's absolutely no penalty or consequences to frequent submissions or getting rejected.
I agree, and much more rewarding. Thank you very much for your guidance :D
They are pretty strict. Like I put the word "beta" in a app before and they rejected it.
As in the don’t want apps in there beta stage?
yeah. I said something like "this is app is kind of a beta, and much more functionality will be added in the future." in an about section 
Just finished setting up a backend MySQL server tied with Node.js. Next month I’m gonna connect it to my app which is only storing stuff locally at the moment to make the user experience more flexible, allowing them to log in and store their data on a private cloud. My app is for client-based individuals who need to keep record of profits, client lists, appointments, etc.
What would be cool is to use 3D Touch to allow a modal or another view controller to display links to Apple Music, Spotify, etc.. That would be separate and more for you to learn but it’s useful learning other APIs. It would allow users to listen to each song and rate them according to how they feel about it you know? I feel as if if you throw a song into a ranking system they may not even know about it.
huh. Like I said that’s an enormous amount of raw audio. So I’d recommend following Audio Queue Service’s ‘bucket’ scheme. Where you have three buckets: Recording / compressing &amp; storing / waiting If you google aqs then you can read up on apples guide for it. 24 hrs seems insane tho. My phone doesn’t have space for that unless you’re planning on compressing it to static. Good luck!
Well that would be true except I mentioned that I also set my sprite node's anchor point to 0,0. I originally did it the way you mentioned. Either way, it ends up a little bit off from the edge, and not in the corner. Also yes pretty sure that's the full height.
I had issues with sprite kit vs uikit and where centers were. I haven’t messed with it in a while but I think in sprite kit (0,0) is the bottom left of the screen. And in the center of a sprite while uikit is centered. I would fix this by setting a camera to 0,0 in skscene. 
How do you like UI design in iOS vs Android?
Very true! You could say that documentation/naming and static type checking try to achieve similar goals. In this case, we can leverage the compiler to be a linter of sorts for documentation, by documenting our types more explicitly.
That’s not even about being strict. That was a rule introduced years ago, because the App Store was becoming overrun with “Lite”/“Demo”/“Beta” apps and it was becoming a mess. But also, Apple wants you to properly test your app and not release betas to the public.
Wanna chill a little? Was giving an example. Play store is fine with the words. It comparison it is more “strict”. 
I don’t want to get in to an argument about the App Store review process, but this one is a pretty clear cut violation of the guidelines, and will get rejected quickly by any reviewer. The app has to _do_ something. Simple as that. This app is far too limited in scope and function.

Did you ever find out why the meetings just stopped though? And all communication stopped? Seems a bit harsh to just cut you off!
I think we often get bit by the _wrong_ abstraction, usually in the form of premature abstraction. The wrong abstraction obscures, the overhead has consequences, and it can make us wary of _any_ abstraction, but the _right_ abstraction makes it easier to see patterns and share ideas. I hope you'll consider that solutions like Tagged (that is, wrapping a value in a lightweight, constrained, semantic context) provide the means to do the _opposite_ of abstract: they allow you to _impart_ meaning to more abstract types (like `Int`s and `String`s). Abstraction is the forgetting of specifics in order to generalize across domains, while `Tagged` takes a more abstract type and locks it _to_ a domain: `Tagged&lt;Tag, RawValue&gt;` is abstract, `RawValue` is _more_ abstract, and `typealias User.Id = Tagged&lt;User, Int&gt;` is the least abstract. The overhead here can be learned very quickly and pays dividends by self-documenting constraints in the type-system and forcing them at compile time. We've experienced a lot of real-world gain from our use of `Tagged`. Your mileage may vary, but I'd encourage you to give it a try! As for validation, the nice thing about Tagged is it's up to you :) If you're fetching data from an API, your app may choose to trust this data is valid already and there's no reason for it to do the work twice. Tagged works with decodable out of the box, so you just swap `String` out for a tagged version and decoding should work just the same. If you're constructing these email types from user input within your app, you can extend `Tagged&lt;User, Email&gt;` with a failable initializer! The point of Tagged is mainly to make it easy to create these type-safe wrappers. You have the power to validate them however you want :)
There's been discussion on the forums from time to time, but no concrete plan. I think it could make it through the process of Swift evolution if someone took the time to make an implementation, though!
Well it was a while ago haha!
Congratulations on your first published app. It was great reading about your journey and then getting to this point.
I understand why I'm getting downvotes. I'm curios about your use-case. What is this snippet? ``` func fetchSubscription(byId id: Int) -&gt; Subscription? { return subscriptions.first(where: { $0.id == id }) } ``` 
You were on the right track in your first sentence, but then .. &gt; What they’re looking for to fix this issue are phone-specific features. Like hooking into the Apple Music API to allow users to actually listen to the songs they’re supposed to be rating. I don't think that's what Apple is looking for ..
I think it's self explanatory, really. You're building the app as a learning exercise. It's probably amusing for you, but in all liklyhood not many people would find it interesting. I would just take the rejection for what it is and accept that this kind of app is not going to be approved by Apple. If you really want to see how users react to it, try to turn it into a website.
Hmm, I had not considered this. I thought it might lead me to the solution, but the scene is equal to the size of the device. So changing the scale doesn’t really do anything. Oh well. I thought this should be a really simple thing to do but I guess not.
 haha, it’s tricky, do some debugging, print out sizes, you’ll see there’s a size mismatch
First experiences: it's not exactly easy to run. I installed it, and typed "periphery", and it printed the names of sub-commands. So I tried "periphery scan", assuming it would just scan the current directory. It told me I needed `--workspace` or `--project`. So I gave it the path to the project, in the current directory. Then it complained I was missing `--schemes`. I tried `periphery help scan` to try to learn everything that was required so it wasn't just printing errors forever, but there's nothing that tells me here which flags are required or not. OK, back to trial-and-error. Eventually I kept going and found that I need `--project`, `--schemes`, and `--targets` (though I don't know why it can't just use the current directory, the default, or the only one). Then it complained `error: Scheme 'XXX' does not exist in 'YYY.xcodeproj'`. I tried the UI name of the scheme, the full path of the scheme file, and the internal hash used, and it still complained the scheme doesn't exist. Strange. Eventually I dug through the documentation and found the sentence: "Important: In order for Periphery to find your schemes, they must be marked as Shared in Xcode's Scheme Manager". So the error message was a lie -- it does accept the UI name of a scheme, but it pretends they don't exist if they're not marked "shared"! I changed my project to make my app scheme "shared", and ran it again. This time I got some other dang error, and my patience ran out. The website says it's all about Swift, and it's for "command line junkies", and additionally offers "Xcode integration", so I figured it would be a plain source analyzer, but it's *really* Xcode-dependent. If you don't have an Xcode project/workspace set up like it expects, it simply won't run at all. I assume that despite Linux being officially supported by Swift, this won't work there at all, either. I tried it out as a curiosity, as I can't imagine I have much (if any) code which is simply unused. Is this a problem that many programmers face? I'd be curious to hear from others: if you could get Periphery to run, how much dead code does it actually find in your programs? Clearly someone has worked very hard on building this program, but I just can't see the use case.
The funny thing is, I re-contacted all of them two days before making this post *in hopes* that I could prove myself wrong, and maybe they had just forgotten about everything and were willing to reconnect... Nope, one of them literally left me on 'seen' in a Linkedin conversation lol I honestly have no idea why they did this. I wish I knew. 
We use it all over the Point-Free code base: https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=Tagged&amp;type= All of our database calls and API requests take and return data with tagged types. This means we can decode the user's cookie to get a `User.Id`, then fetch the current user using this `User.Id`, then fetch the user's subscription using `Subscription.Id`, which lives on the user. The code reads the same as it would with `Int`s, but it's far more safe and descriptive, and has prevented us from accidentally writing code that mixed ids up. We do a lotta experimental functional stuff, so not everything in here is gonna be readable to the uninitiated :)
That was an excellent write up, and high quality comment. 
I could see it being useful for huge migrations in large codebases but I’d be interested to see how it runs on projects that have 10,000+ classes. Also you probably won’t find those projects maintained by a team of 1 and $800+ for 20+ developers seems a bit pricey for something I’m sure a larger corporation could write themselves. 
This is on a fresh install of macOS? It shouldn't be crashing like that. What's the stack trace look like?
Pricey? $800 is roughly one day's worth of work for one corporate programmer. I don't know what's involved, but even without the fancy webpage and licensing system and online documentation, there's clearly a lot more than one day's worth of work here. If it solves a real problem, any corporation would be glad to hand over $800 for it. I'm just not sure it does.
Selenium is a tool for web browser automation. It’s most commonly used for running automated integration tests in the browser. 
Okay so its not really an iOS testing tool then i take it?
&gt; Is the XCode software this bad in general? Often, it is.
App Store. Latest version of Mac OS and Xcode. In the middle of reinstalling. If it still crashes I'll post the stack trace.
&gt; its not really it's* it's* = it is The rest should be obvious.
Tbh none of the terms you mentioned in your question is iOS specific. Agile andScrum are basically team/project management strategies. Depending on client requirements, deadlines, etc, a project manager would decide on a strategy on how to go on about with the project, how to organize it, documentation and how to involve the client during this whole process. 
Borderline "Hot or Not" app
I'm so used to open source tools that I just assumed this one was one until I reached the end of the page.

Just started going through the Hacking With Swift tutorials since I know nothing about programming. My goal is by this time next year to be able to create a basic app.
Thank you /u/twostraws I actually found Hacking With Swift through one of your posts on here
Awesome! Please let me know if you hit any problems – you can tweet me @twostraws or email paul@hackingwithswift.com :)
Author of Periphery here. First, thank you for the honest feedback. Even if only out of curiosity, you clearly devoted a fair amount of time to trying Periphery, and it's very gracious of you to share your experience in detail. &gt;though I don't know why it can't just use the current directory, the default, or the only one That's a fair assumption, I should certainly add a guided setup function. &gt;Then it complained error: Scheme 'XXX' does not exist in 'YYY.xcodeproj' Yep, that's a totally unhelpful error message. \+1 will improve! &gt;This time I got some other dang error, and my patience ran out. I'd love to know what this error was? &gt;but it's *really* Xcode\-dependent. Yeah, it's very dependent on Xcode at the moment, though it's possible I could make it work on Linux. I'd need to hear that a lot of people want that that first though \- not an easy task. Thanks for reminding me I need to detail system requirements. &gt;I tried it out as a curiosity, as I can't imagine I have much \(if any\) code which is simply unused. Of course it depends on the size of your application, but even with a fairly small app, you might be surprised at some of the things it can find. In general though, Periphery is more suitable for large projects where the team is trying any angle they can find to keep on top of complexity, build times or anything that might potentially turn into a road block.
I don't blame you for that assumption, I confess to say I've done the same in the past. The reason I didn't make it open source is: 1. Some parts are really quite tricky to implement, and so I saw some potential commercial value in that. 2. I wanted this tool to be around and working for a long time, I created it because I needed it. Open source projects have a tendency to languish and become kinda crappy. I see the commercial avenue as a way of ensuring that doesn't happen.
&gt;Care to share what you were trying to do that got rejected? I guess they are seen as trying to bypass the fees Apple charges.
Seems they are cracking down on minimal apps or apps that should/could be web pages instead of apps.
Oddly phrased question. Yes, they are strict. However, if you follow the guidelines you should be just fine. That is what they are for!
Some random blogger posts a video trashing something? Yeah, couldn’t care less. Swift is a strong and growing technology that’s THE direction being taken on an extremely popular platform. It’s not going anywhere soon. 
&gt; I'd love to know what this error was? I think it looked like something related to building the project. I'll try again later when I have some time. I'm curious to know what Xcode/swiftc-related functionality or entry points it uses. I've got at least 2 or 3 different versions of Xcode installed here, for example. Does it need the version of the compiler for this project to be the first one in $PATH, for example? (Do I need to go figure out `xcode-select`?) Is there a command line that it builds and executes, which I can try to get working here before I point Periphery at it? I've never built any of my applications from the command line before, so I'm not really clear on how that works. I'm rather curious what it finds in my application now...
Some apps do just this. That is why they need constantly updated when add ons are released for the games. If they pulled from a source they wouldn’t have to update the app but instead just wait for the source to be updated (assuming it’s not their own server where they would update it themselves)
I'd say the classic is the ToDo list as an exercise, but TBH you should pick a direction. A direction would be like games\-\&gt;3D games\-\&gt;2D games\-\&gt;social, AR, utility, business, etc... There's also the issue of what are you looking to do, get a job, build apps as a hobby, freelance, etc... One thing that can be kinda fun is to pick an app that you like, and clone it. Make it a challenge and figure out how they do each thing. Just one example: I like freecell, solitare, Jezball, and some trivia games. All of the jezball games suck, they don't do gestures right and it ruins the game. One project I did was a news feed reader. I wanted to have a customizable, multi\-source feed reader with data caching. So I built that. Give us an idea of what direction you want to go in. Are you trying to get a job from this?
I &lt;3 U.
Stop posting about her course. Thanks. 
My bad, I now realize how excruciatingly vague my request was. Really appreciate the well thought out response. My goal is to transition into a career in IOS Development or to create a profitable app, whichever comes first. Not really interested in games, so I guess my focus would be more along the lines of Media, Social, Data Manipulation, Platforms, etc. I actually really like the idea of trying to clone some of my favorite apps and will most likely work on that this evening. Again, thanks for the well thought out response.
&gt;I'm curious to know what Xcode/swiftc\-related functionality or entry points it uses. It uses xcodebuild to identify build arguments needed to pass to SourceKit, it also uses xcodebuild to check your project compiles successfully \(you'd get weird results if SourceKit tried to index a project that doesn't fully build successfully\). If you pass the '\-\-verbose' option to 'scan', you'll see the xcodebuild commands it executes \(ignore the ones that use the '\-dry\-run' option, they're only used for identifying build arguments, and won't actually build your project.\). 
I set content mode to aspect fill it works in view controller but in simulation its still same. Im not sure how to use that code
I’m learning to, trying to make a simple one button app that sends midi signal to both Mac and pc from iOS.. super difficult and I haven’t even tried wireless yet (Bluetooth/WiFi). Thinking webmidi might be easier than coremidi, give it a try and keep in touch if you’d like
Are you resetting the image programmatically or is it all set at runtime through storyboard?
Its all on storyboard, i didnt do any coding except linking pages together and adding buttons to interact
In that case, I would cover all the basics with a special focus on data \(getting, storing, displaying...\) and UI/UX \(making it easy to use and very functional\). I'd also think hard about the code. Don't go in with the mindset of "how do I make this work" alone, go in thinking that someday someone's going to pay you big coin to write code that will be a company asset. Something that others will jump in and modify. These things can be done with a Tic\-Tac\-Toe game or a complex mobile enterprise solution. Few other suggestions: look at a number of job listings and see what they are asking for. You'll see quite a bit of common things from unit testing to core data to core animation... You would probably benefit from a group project. I've tried to get a few going around here, but it hasn't been easy. Generally, they'll want to see that you know the teamwork tools.
Your attempt to call out a low-effort post is negated by your irrelevant search results about the health supplement.
What an interesting use of phantom types.
Did you set your constraints?
Ahhh. Gotcha. So then if that is the case, where the info is all downloaded when the app is installed, how do you go about getting all that info? You don’t really have to know about the game I’m speaking of, if you know what a game guide app is. They’re al pretty much the same 
Actually, I’ve never heard of a game guide app. But, I would imagine it would be downloaded pre-installed into your Documents directory, and then fetched using CoreData. Does that answer your question?
It's just our style guide. I used to always omit `self` but as we write a lot of functions _and_ methods, it can be nice to have syntax that differentiates explicitly.
Thanks
Oh, my apologies! I shouldn’t have assumed that. They’re just apps (unofficial) people make that contain pretty much all the information someone could hopefully need about a game. From quests, to armors and weapons, to locations, etc. Its pretty much a wiki website like [this](https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Monster+Hunter+World+Wiki) but in a mobile app form. So what I was wondering is how, if I wanted to make my own mobile guide app, would I get info from a website like this on to an app 
The example Mac app that comes with SwiftPriorityQueue includes an example of A* that you may want to take a look at. To answer your question below about whether it's a good implementation of a priority queue—it uses the very standard binary heap backing. This specific implementation is used in several other projects successfully and decently popular. I'm the author so if you have questions specific to it feel free to ask me. https://github.com/davecom/SwiftPriorityQueue 
His facts aren't correct. Why should I care about his opinions based on them? 
Except for the top result is the correct answer for the context. 
Agile = throw spaghetti against the fridge every week and see what sticks then have a scrum about it.
By grouping you mean that they replace old notification with new one? You can achieve that by using `apns-collapse-id` header in push notification you send from your server to the app. When notification with collapse id arrives, it replaces old notification with that id. Your collapse id can be id of user in given conversation. I don’t know though if Firebase allows to send collapse id
Thanks alot, I'll give it a shot. So, provided the firebase supports apns-collapse-id and I configure it properly, the iOS should do the grouping by id ?

Don't even think about it.
Yes, yes [it does](https://mobile.twitter.com/jenoxx/status/863778680279007232/photo/1).
I usually go with "Developer Tools".
swift is good for apple's environment. not friendly for other systems. that's sad. such a good language.
Most of the reception has been positive :) I find that forums in general have a few loud voices in the crowd that seem to rise to the top. The examples in the README are all real, recent examples, simplified, from the Point-Free code base. They are also representative of code that has appeared in some shape or form in almost every code base I've worked on, which, as they grow, are constantly refactored and added to. I've also worked in large, production code bases without static types, and confusing ids when passing them to methods has led to security issues and other bugs. This stuff is very common :)
These are really interesting. I haven’t looked at the code yet, but the end results are really impressive. Thanks for sharing! Now I want to make some 🤓
I don't know how important it is, but there is Server Side Swift supported by IBM and others. It's apart of TensorFlow and some other things too. IDK, how much impact that'll make.
TensorFlow for swift, I believe you can only run on Mac. therefore, only apple's developers care and who play with machine learning.
As exploration it’s fine. You wouldn’t really do a spinner/animated sprite that way though. It’s using an atom bomb to swat a mosquito. Look at the interface to CALayer for setting up an animated image if you want to do this for reals.
Strongly disagree with your assertion. CAShapeLayer and related CALayer subclasses are totally fine for this task. Core Animation runs on the GPU, which makes these very performant.
Not on your iPhone but on an iPad yes. You can download Playgrounds (I’ve not done it but it is possible to do).
Darn. :/ I just sold my iPad away recently 
The app SoloLearn helps you learn the syntax and basics for lots of programming languages including swift on the go.
Also he can try MIMO (formerly known as Swiftly). It started as a cute Swift learning app, not it has all kinds of IT tutorials.
Ah yeah that’s a good app too but it requires a paid subscription if you wanna go further into learning. SoloLearn is free if money is an issue.
Ah yeah sadly it’s kinda outdated. They recently updated the whole thing so maybe they’ll get to updated the swift course.
Thank you so much for this. I was making a huge work around. This is brilliant. 
Added support for live preview of markup documents in Xcode to [MarkupKit](https://github.com/gk-brown/MarkupKit): https://gkbrown.org/2018/04/19/markupkit-4-1-released/ Also added support for expressions in data binding. 
Swift also runs on Linux.
I think i understand whole simulation thing wrongly. I just find out you can choose which iphone model you want to work with. Selected iphone x and jumped right into it for a test app. View controller becomes the shape of chosen iphone model and if you try another simulation it obviously dont fit to screen. I couldnt understand if i have to start over for each iphone model but even if its thats the case im happy solving this problem because otherwise its impossible to fit all text places,buttons and image files in a single app for all iphone models
Lol all of the results shown to me were medical results. 
Using constraints allows you to change the shape and size of each element on the screen depending on the device or size of the screen. 
This is a good write-up for entry level programmers that want to build an app using one of the numerous async APIs for the first time. Going forward, it should be mentioned that concepts such as Promises and Observables are probably the way to go, at least if the system gets more complex, async actions need to be chained, etc.
Sure, it was related to code signing, but I don't understand why that matters for static analysis. I get why it would need a working Xcode project file (and I see it uses "xcproj" to parse this), but why's it trying to do any part of an actual build? The app's "Manifesto" says: &gt; For statically typed languages such as Swift, this can be even more frustrating as a single line of code can block the whole project from compiling successfully. Imagine your relief to discover that the awkward code is no longer used and can be banished to the underworld at the hand of the almighty Delete Key. This sounds great, and it sounds like if I get stuck because my project isn't even building, that Periphery can help me identify unused parts of it, so I can delete them and (potentially) fix my build. Clearly, though, that's not a supported use case. I need to start with a fully working project before Periphery will run at all. &gt; I’ll release a fix for that later today. Cool, thanks.
I don't know if this will help, but a search found that -67030 is the error code for "errSecCSInfoPlistFailed". Do you have anything that could be modifying the Info.plist during the build process? https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1574088-code_signing_services_result_cod/errseccsinfoplistfailed
I have become a fan of the [Siesta framework](https://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/). It's not perfect - it doesn't inherently handle chaining very well - and doesn't adhere to Promise constructs - but as a basic wrapper for cacheable URLSession stuff - it is pretty solid.
Yes, I knew it was a simple warning that I noticed right after I posted. Thank you. Yes, as soon as I posted this I thought that it was going to be a simple matter of removing `result.reversed()`, but of course, when I do that I get an output of : ["IPPLPPHHH_", "PNNFFRNEQS", "RLVKVKTKVD", "GEKTFGKNFN", "PNNYTQARIW", "LDLGKTNHAS", "PRLATLNTRD", "NFTTPTVSQN", "KHINWVRSVT", "ASWEKQEDNE", "AGIMTELWYT", "SESAIPFPHR", "YPYGGIMEEI", "EDVGAGMTVL", "MVKILEKLTE", "TVKKPIPETA", "KKTAFSIKLD", "KEILLDRSAG", "VVNFNTANFK", "WIDTTIFYSG", "IKKTDCKEFS", "LMNKSFPELG", "FHGGVDSLVD", "TTVHGYFSSI", "NITDNHGKNK", "LVLMTHFITK", "QNIAYKTDKD", "HGLVKLFNKW", "IFSVKKNMEI", "KLVDVPSKST", "NFGIIAAWKI", "FWAIRGGGGE", "LDRKSMGEDL", "AHLVNVDGKV", "TGLAADNIID", "GGGTGALMRN", "PTVGVGGHFS", "ENLSFPGGTC", "EVTTWINEKN", "AWVEAGATLG", "SIKIDVHSQT", "FVVVDLRNMH", "EGMSYISQVP", "IRTRSGGHDA", "ILCSKKVGLQ", "PSNNSHIQAT", "TTPKPLVIVT", "TIQNLRFISD", "DQLTMSILNS", "ANPKLVYTQH", "CFSKHIPNNV", "IANPRENFLK", "FFLSFHIQIS", "SFWFVCKIIF", "MNCSAF"] This is truly backwards, as `"MNCSAFSFWF"` should be the first element followed by `"VCKIIFFFLS"`, etc. 
This is kind of a lousy benchmark. - It doesn't check the output, even once. Do we know the output is correct? - It uses a tiny object, which is not representative of any JSON document I've ever had to parse. - It uses the same object every time through the loop. You might just be testing whether the inner loop fits in cache. That can be a useful attribute of a parser, but only if you're testing real data, and only if that's what you claim to be testing. - The test record has a UUID, a Date, a Bool, and a String. The "Codable" test parses the Date and Bool. The "SwiftProtoBuf" parses only the Bool. Each test does different amounts of parsing. Is it any surprise the winner of this test is also the one that did the least processing? Date parsing is notoriously expensive. The winning library won because it had the fewest features. It's not really faster. It's just delegating the most expensive part of parsing to the user, outside of the benchmark. Pull the date parser into your inner loop and watch it blow out your cache lines with this library, too. SwiftProtoBuf looks like a neat library but it's not really a competitor of Codable.
I've had good luck with [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit), for serializing asynchronous calls, including handing of return values. It does have its downsides, one of them being the [odd and incorrect error messages the Swift compiler spits](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Documentation/Troubleshooting.md) out when there is an error inside a closure. That's not the fault of PromiseKit, but it does make things harder.

I don't think he has direct experience technologies he's talking about. It's sad his channel has so many subscribers, a lot of people are getting bad info.
This might be a bit simpler: import Foundation extension String { func inserting(separator: String, every n: Int) -&gt; String { return self.splitBy(length: n).joined(separator: separator) } func splitBy(length: Int) -&gt; [String] { // Safety checks and early exits precondition(length &gt;= 0) guard !self.isEmpty else { return [String]() } guard length != 0 else { return [self] } var result = [String]() var start = self.startIndex // repeat until the guard kicks us out while true { // advance the end, break if it's past self.endIndex guard let end = self.index(start, offsetBy: length, limitedBy: self.endIndex) else { break } // add the current split result.append(String(self[start..&lt;end])) start = end } // finish any leftover characters if start != self.endIndex { // add remaining result.append(String(self[start..&lt;self.endIndex])) } return result } }
You're pretty spot-on for everything, just wanted to point out for others: &gt;The winning library won because it had the fewest features. It's not really faster. It's just delegating the most expensive part of parsing to the user, outside of the benchmark. This hasn't been true in my experience, maybe in this benchmarking example (since I think you're referring to the protobuf results), but not in general. Swift has a lot of hidden performance costs. A while back I tried switching my app over to Codable but stopped when I found it to be twice as slow than manually grabbing values from the dictionary. For my app that would be bad, since I occasionally deal with 2MB+ JSON files. I profiled it a bit and found (IIRC) something like 46% of the time for Codable was spent dynamically casting values. The point I'm trying to make is that performance can definitely vary a lot between Swift libraries.
Can someone give this more context for me? I’m just now learning swift and do not understand the application. 
Read the docs from iBooks or blogs. I’d argue if you’re new enough, you need to set more time aside to get fully engaged than on the go. Or you’re doing stuff that’s complex Enough that the phone is a pain in the ass? I mostly reas docs and blogs on the go. 
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this! 
I’m brand new. Just got the udemy course on ios11 swift dev. But was hoping there was a way to practice while I’m sitting at work or something 
No problem. Your new solution is interesting but creating an `Array` from a `String` could potentially be expensive. With this code I’ve tried to avoid copying data like that. I suspect this way is more efficient but in the end either way works. 
For your first question, if you're going to iterate over the array the new array is dependent on, try iterating over it like this ` for (index, value) in arr.enumerated() { ... } ` Using the index value, you should be able to figure out how to increment each value by whatever value you want. Regarding doing something for every Nth row, use modulo(%) on the `indexPath.row` in your table's`cellForRowAtIndexPath` method. Modulo basically divides and gives the remainder of the division. When you modulo by N and the value returned is 0, then you know that row is a multiple of that value. Examples: 0 % 3 = 0 //do something on this row. 1 % 3 = 1 2 % 3 = 2 3 % 3 = 0 //do something on this row. 4 % 3 = 1 5 % 3 = 2 6 % 3 = 0 //do something on this row. 7 % 3 = 1 8 % 3 = 2 9 % 3 = 0 //do something on this row. 
As a straight up newbie, I’ve no idea what you mean by that haha 
I find that doing a hard reboot of the phone solves this 90&amp;#37; of the time. Do the hard reboot. DO THE HARD REBOOT. I spent the past 10 hours troubleshooting an unreproducible bug for someone who refused to do the reboot. All problems solved on reboot. 
Easy CellforRowAtIndexPath(index path){ If indexpath.row % 3 = 0{ let cell = UITableViewCell(whatever) // custom cell code here } more checks Else if ... {} ... } 
But with this example there’s nothing to learn, other than the fact that there’s a few override methods on table views. You should know what each method does and how they work. All I did was present the method the OP may have been looking for. When you’re learning to develop on iOS for the first time, it can be hard to remember the little things. If OP is a programmer they know how to deal with the logic, it’s what method to use. 
Thanks for your comment. I may just not know enough enough about indexes, but the problem I'm finding is if I do something like the following for (index,item) in arr.enumerated() where index % 10 == 10 { print("\t\(index) \n \(item)") } /* 0 MNCSAFSFWF 10 KKVGLQIRTR 20 ADNIIDAHLV 30 NHGKNKTTVH 40 LEKLTEEDVG 50 */ It will give me an output that looks okay, but in actuality it's only giving me every tenth value of the original item. I need the second array to be completely independent of the first, it will only contains x integers \(x = number of elements in the first array\) in increments of ten. 
My answers were to two separate problems but you seem to be combining them into one here. For your iterating by 10 to fill your array, use this function and don't add the `where` part. for (index,item) in arr.enumerated() { // do something with index here to generate your desired value } The % is for your `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell` function. You said you wanted to do something every Nth cell, using % on your indexPath.row is how you can accomplish that.
Good points (though 46% of the time spent casting sounds a little crazy). Ultimately, "fastest JSON library" doesn't mean much without context. These aren't apples-to-apples comparisons. An application has data in format X, and needs to translate it to format Y. The programmer needs to decide if they care most about raw performance, or about convenience and maintainability. If the only goal is performance, we profile. That might involve a different JSON library, or using it in a way that does less parsing (do we *need* those dates as Date instances?), or using a different format for your data -- or something else entirely. There's no one best answer for all cases, and it's easy for a microbenchmark to hide the true cost of a library, especially if it's not benchmarking it in the same way that the application will use it.
Parsing JSON into data is a very common task that mobile developers do, for example when receiving data from an API. There are a few different ways of doing this parsing. This article benchmarks different third party libs and the built in support that Swift has, to figure out which one encodes/decodes JSON files faster.
You answer + compering it to u/phelp95´s answer teached med a lot about extentions. Thank you both!
yes, but lack of supports.
Welcome! Glad it helped you
I actually come from that world and saw it all evolving, which was great. I hope we reach that in Swift as well. However, due to guarantees regarding queuing and threading, the topic of async/await might be a bit more complex in Swift.
I mainly wanted to point out that the examples were real and the production bugs from ignoring them have been real. The more years I program, the less I think I "really" know how to program. :) I think identifiers are a pretty common thing to new-type, though if you have suggestions for improvements to the README based on your experiences, we're all ears and open source :D
Glad to help!
I think it would also be useful to have synchronous (blocking) methods for many async things. I guess blocking HTTP requests make little, if any, sense in client-side development, but they can be useful on the server side (not always, but sometimes there's really nothing for you to do but wait for an API result), for scripting etc.
"Ever" is pretty definitive. There are clear use cases when it should be used. If your object graph dictates that self will exist when the completion is called and you wish to avoid a reference cycle, then use unowned. 
That’s a slippery slope to go down. You can think “self will always exist here” until...it doesn’t. There are always edge cases that can fall through the cracks. If you get in the habit of using unowned self just because you think it will always be there, you are setting yourself up for some crashes. Even if you are right most of the time, iOS can be rather complex you could be wrong, plus you are setting a precedent for other teammates/peers that might not have the same knowledge or thoroughness that you do. Now I do think there are scenarios where maybe it would be ok. For instance, if it is a scenario where if self does not exist, then it’s better to just crash rather than leave the user in some undefined state. But even here, I’d rather just use weak self and a guard to intentionally throw a fatal error. 
Is it working after new build uploaded to iTunesConnect?
Yes. It’s not loading for me as well. Apple reported that it resolved the issue [here](https://developer.apple.com/system-status/). But still not working for me. 
A fatalError and an implicitly unwrapped nil value would have the same impact for the user here? Anyway, I wasn't suggesting getting in the habit of using unowned self "just because you think it will always be there". I'm saying have awareness of your object graph and lifecycle and choose the appropriate tool for the job. There are scenarios where you 100% can guarantee self exists, in those situations use unowned. In others use weak or capture self.
Awesome info! I’ll look into all of that. Thanks! What do you mean by hardcoding data into the app, and suggest against it? 
We’ve generally used unowned in (almost all) observable subscribes, for what it’s worth, due to the nature of DisposeBag’s. That’s been the only exception.
It didn't work :( This issue has been frustrating me for the past few days and I can not get support from apple because I'm not a member of the Developer Program
This is an overly complicated way of explaining closures. Way, way too complicated. The initial code is so poorly written that I can't imagine this would help anyone.
Let's say you want to be able to view the details of any item in Monster Hunter World in your app. The correct approach would be to build a generic "item viewer" screen in the app, which can display details for any item. In the application itself, you would have a list of the items to choose from. Clicking on one would do the following logic: 1 - Query for the item's details using its unique ID (using an API, DB, etc.). 2 - Pass the object's details into the generic screen. 3 - The generic screen will populate itself with the item's details, showing you what you want to see. This way, you program only one screen that can be reused everywhere versus coding one per item (hardcoding).
Agreed. Also halfway done, great course at 1.5x speed
&gt; A fatalError and an implicitly unwrapped nil value would have the same impact for the user here? Unless you think of your coworkers as consumers of your work as well as the level of documentation you leave behind. fatalError or assertionFailure always have a reason and demonstrate you are aware of the problem but think it's not a good state for the program to be in. Equally, there's very little harm in doing self?. instead of self. I've seen some weird behaviour in apps when they're monkeytested and / or in very crappy network conditions. For the layman I would always say "choose weak unless you really understand what you're doing" since the penalty in picking weak is so low.
Sole proprietor until you’re making some money. But def look into LLC because there are a lot of benefits in the tax dept 
Ohhhhh. I think I get what you’re saying. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
And yet, the top rated comment here, at the moment when you wrote that comment, was someone who already found it helpful. Score one for reality over imagination.
Does this means that google rewrote tensorflow in Swift???\
As of 6pm CST, yes.
That’s the error. I only have one apple id.
Create an another one it’s free. :) I have a few dummy ones. 
Sole Proprietor, mostly because I’ve not looked seriously into the benefits of an LLC.... perhaps I should!
Neither if you are looking for outside investment. Gotta go for a Inc. 
LLC or S-Corp is better. Otherwise you can be sued personally for patent or copyright infringement, errors in the software, etc. I used a local accountant for the paperwork and discussed the pros and cons of each business type with an attorney friend after reading Nolo's book on the subject. There are cases where a C Corp is advantageous. For example, it allows you to deduct childcare, health insurance, healthcare spending, a company car, etc. A good accountant can explain it all to you. 
Recently I was trying to work out how to implement a middleware stack that allowed both pre and post handling/intercepting of the centre function. In particular I wanted the stack to be dynamic, storing the middleware as an array that could be modified at runtime. I couldn't find any clear examples of how to achieve this, so I'm sharing my solution in case anyone else is also trying to work out how to do this.
Beautiful code, thank you.
I operate as a SMLLC (single-member LLC) - it is a legal LLC, but you use your own SSN as your tax ID and you basically file as an individual with 1099s. At least I think that is what I am. I actually have a state ID for my LLC, but I do not use that. I use my own SSN as an SMLLC. All of my checks are made out to both myself and my LLC name. I think I am doing it right, but if that is not what I am suppose to do, it would be nice to know. I don't usually spend money on tax / legal advice. https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/single-member-limited-liability-companies 
Sorry, I was able to log into TestFlight and check status, I did not try to upload a new build. 
I would say understand the language you are programming in and the appropriate use cases, rather than trying to create sweeping rules, that is a bad habit to get into. The harm is debugging. Coming from Objective-C, nil references can be notoriously awkward to debug, so I'd rather fail early with a crash during development because of an honest mistake and structure/re-structure your object graph appropriately so you have a solid understanding of whether to use weak or unowned. There is a reason the language has the two options at your disposal, they should both be used for different reasons at different times.
Hey sorry for the slow reply, little hectic today. I'll be working on fixing your crash tomorrow, I'll let you know when there's a new release to try. As for the Shared scheme, you can check the xcscheme file into your source control.
For now. Ever heard of skating to where the puck is going to be? Swift has both strong open source communities and corporate backing. There are rumors of Google adopting some sort of Swift support. It makes sense for them to do so as well. You are correct that it is at an alpha state outside of the Apple ecosystem, but give it time and you might be surprised.
Here is one example of how Swift might be about to become much more broadly supported https://www.theverge.com/google/2017/11/20/16681556/apple-swift-language-google-fuchsia-os-open-source
Actually, I realized after the fact that I could make it a lot cleaner: import Foundation extension String { func splitBy(length: Int) -&gt; [String] { precondition(length &gt;= 0) guard !self.isEmpty else { return [String]() } guard length != 0 else { return [self] } var stride = sequence(first: self.startIndex) { guard $0 != self.endIndex else { return nil} guard let next = self.index($0, offsetBy: length, limitedBy: self.endIndex) else { return self.endIndex } return next } guard var start = stride.next() else { return [self] } return stride.map { end in defer { start = end } return String(self[start..&lt;end]) } } } 
Okay I kinda get what you are saying, but I guess I don't really know how to know if I would want to have that retain cycle or not. When you say 'the object' are you referring to whatever object the closure came from? Or are you talking about the 'self' object? Thanks.
Thanks. Interesting how Hacking with Swift always uses it. I'm glad I know from other experience, but I feel like someone just starting out and using these tutorials might think that it is something everyone does all the time. I had never used it once until yesterday lol.
Thanks. What you guys are saying makes sense, the only thing I don't really know is, how would I know if self would still be around?
I was a sole proprietor when I wrote the one app I have, but became an LLC this year to separate my work from my personal banking. (Even though I don’t really make money.)
good point!!
I'm happy to help...
 Would maybe start with a table view to display all the entries and just hook up a standard view for your form. Should be too difficult. Then you could always add on a view and use map kit to display the users locations later if you have time to code it in before your project is due.
That question is somewhat backwards. The GoF wrote that book to give standardized names to existing patterns, and encourage people to create their own. When you read a book about English, do you ask "Does anyone have any useful examples of Prepositional Phrases, for science fiction stories?" Nobody works like that. The obvious answer to your question is: pretty much every "add" method there is a Decorator (subview, gesture recognizer, motion effect, etc). Are you going to be more effective at writing programs now because you know that some Smalltalk programmers in the early 1990's decided to call this the "decorator pattern"? Probably not.
Yeah, I was getting a 404 response as well in the browser but running the app shows the correct info using the json file.
No way, that's crazy talk. Writing custom tooling can be mega expensive.
No. QLPreviewController is rendered out of process, and there’s very limited hooks for customization. 
The use case is way more common than you'd think. If you are used to working on a project all alone, then it would be easy to not see the point. You are aware of every change happening and know when code is unused. Step into my shoes for a min: I work for a HUGE company and we have hundreds of developers. Our codebase is too big to keep the entire thing in your head, not to mention, the rate of change is so fast that if you get get up to speed on a section of code... the next time you come back to it, it's completely different. We're constantly running into cases where some new feature gets dropped in from a different team which then does something as simple as removing a call to a function. They didn't need that function any more but didn't remove it because sometimes it's hard to know if one of the other billion functions needs it (especially if using protocols). Now you have orphaned code. It's quite easy imo. Yes, there are ways to mitigate it, but those are also easy to overlook and/or not do. $0.02 Thanks for the tool /u/andheshatonaturtle. Testing now.
If it helps here it is with annotations. Feel free to ask about any of it. /** Splits a String into length chunks with remainder as the last element. */ func splitBy(length: Int) -&gt; [String] { // Negative lengths are nonsense. precondition(length &gt; 0) // See if length is a single split or shorter, // if so just return the String. guard self.count &gt; length else { return [self] } // Creates a Sequence of String.Index where each use is seeded // by the previous result. Ends when nil is returned. var stride = sequence(first: self.startIndex) { // See if last return was endIndex, // if so return nil to end the sequence. guard $0 != self.endIndex else { return nil} // Get next index at length away. If it's past the // endIndex we return endIndex. This uses the entire String. guard let next = self.index($0, offsetBy: length, limitedBy: self.endIndex) else { return self.endIndex } // Return the next index. return next } // Kick off the current chunk by getting the first value // from the sequence. It should be startIndex. guard var start = stride.next() else { return [self] } // Now stride is at the second value in the sequence. Make that // the end of the current chunk and use it to slice the String. // Then set start to end and repeat until stride returns nil. // Since this is in a map method it will create a [String], return it. return stride.map { end in // Use of defer so that we can directly return the value. defer { start = end } return String(self[start..&lt;end]) } } 
In explaining this out I just realized that Grid does the calculations of where the views should be. Thanks!
Wow, I completely understand it now after playing around with it in Xcode. Really, really well done. Are you a professional programmer? Using defer like that is awesome. Only improvement I could see is that you don't actually need that first guard statement since that condition will be handled by: guard var start = stride.next() else { return [self] } EDIT: What do you think about defining stride like: var stride = sequence(first: startIndex) { guard $0 != self.endIndex else { return nil } return self.index($0, offsetBy: length, limitedBy: self.endIndex) ?? self.endIndex }
A simpler explanation would be more useful.
I am a professional programmer, I've done a lot of professional C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift work. Thanks for the appreciation, just like everyone else I'm still learning some of the interesting patterns Swift has to offer. Defer is a very powerful tool. I use it a ton to do return values like this and it's great for resource allocation/deallocation pairs. The first `guard` isn't necessary, it's there to shortcut the execution so that you don't have to go through creating the sequence and using it a few times. It's purely an optimization. Oh, it does offer one benefit: an empty string will return `[""]` rather than `[]`. I think the former is a bit more correct. You're right, you could use the nil coalescing operator to handle that, it's syntactic sugar for just what I'm doing there. I didn't use it because I was trying to show the logic a bit more but it definitely makes the implementation cleaner.
Thanks - good point about the empty string return value. I'm a professional programmer as well, but have been working mostly with Python for the last 4 years. I've been getting into Swift lately and am in love with it. I don't really want to deal with Python anymore except for small scripts, and even there I think I might eventually decide to use Swift.
 protocol ViewDelegate: class {} class View { weak var delegate: ViewDelegate? } class ViewController: ViewDelegate { let view = View() init() { view.delegate = self } } The view's delegate must be weak because the view controller is retaining the view, and if the view retains the view controller we have a retain cycle. Weak is used rather than unowned because the delegate may be released from memory during the view's lifetime, so the property must be nil-ed out to avoid crashing. class Model { var valueDidChange: ((String) -&gt; Void)? } class Manager { let model = Model() init() { self.model.valueDidChange = { [unowned self] value in self.notify(value) } } } Self cannot be strongly captured in the closure otherwise there will be a retain cycle: manager retains model, model retains closure, closure retains manager. Unowned is used here because the model exists for the entirely of the managers lifetime, therefore using weak would not make sense and it would unnecessarily complicate the closure.
Great job!
I've not build my app yet, but I ran the fix with the solution from the teacher's edition, and it worked! Thank you for the help.
Well said, maybe I should quote you on my website 😆 If you run into any issues please email support@peripheryapp.com
I'm not used to any size in particular. I've worked for companies with tens of thousands of developers, and we had many problems, but this was never among them. Speaking more generally, it's *very* hard to fix an organizational problem with a technical solution. There are entire companies which sell 'enterprise software' to other companies where people never use it. I think the great software engineer Upton Sinclair had something to say about that.
You'd probably have a lot more luck asking on a Xamarin forum.
DispatchQueue.global... for your background function. Pop back onto the main thread with DispatchQueue.main. If this is a network library you’re using it’s probably dispatching to a background thread already. 
Haha I hear you. I’m glad you got there in the end. My entire goal of writing this was to hopefully prevent others from struggling through this as we did.
Inside your background thread, when it’s time to update the UI , perform a regular dispatch to main queue `DispatchQueue.main.async{ }`
So they move the same rate but different distances? And you want the same arrival time? Speed = distance/time. So determine your time you want and solve for speed.
Where and how will this data be used? If it's only for local use, Core Data will do the job. If you need to get this data to a server for you to use from many sources, that's different. Do you need to cache the data for a while, do they need access to the data off line? Give us more to go on and we might be able to help.
Nsarchiver for local use. CloudKit if you need to sync.
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o1FvJaklps0ndtz4iuawfzHGicL7sYBL here is what the output looks like, along with the outlets.
I need an simple Table which can be downloaded via Json so the Data can be used for other purpose like web applications
Any database (even a text file) is more than capable of this. It comes down to what's most convenient for you with your infrastructure.
Ok the way I do things like this is by directly changing the velocity of the object to what you want when you start (for example, CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 0) if you want it to start by going to the right). Then, change the restitution of the object to 0. Doing so will make the object never lose momentum when bouncing off the walls, this making it stay at a continuous speed, regardless of how far the distance is.
Also, correct me if I misunderstood anything.
Thank you very much, I will research and look for what fits the best. Thanks&amp; have a nice day mister!
If you used RxSwift you wouldn't have to worry about this. Just make a driver out of your result and the rest is taken care of automatically.
It has a lot to do with LLDB (Low Level Debugger) and LLVM. It’s an unfortunate reality. 
Is that allowed? What was the acceptance process like? 
: / 
&gt; What Database should I use for saving locations Data? What database* should I use for saving location* data*? Please. Random capitalization is bad. --- You can use most anything. You can even persist it in a dictionary or an array. 
It looks like the view outlet isn’t hooked up to anything. 
One tip is just turn on break on all exceptions :)
I actually had to talk with somebody on the phone to explain everything. The key importance was that you couldn't get individual accounts but everything came as a part from a larger contract. Imagine filling in a hour sheet for your company while using a commercial product sold to your company. The individual access isn't sold separately.
How do you do that?
Finally watched this talk! I got everything built and am playing around with the code base. I was wondering if I could debug using breakpoints. All I am trying to do is follow Erica Sadun's post on [https://ericasadun.com/2018/04/15/writing\-swift\-adventures\-in\-compiler\-mods/](https://ericasadun.com/2018/04/15/writing-swift-adventures-in-compiler-mods/) . I would like to provide a .swift file with the file and inspect variables with breakpoints in Xcode. Any tips?
You can absolutely do that, provided you build with Xcode. You can place breakpoints however you normally place them in Xcode.
You're nearly there. In your case, you don't need a completion handler since you're already dispatching back and forth between a background and the main queue, so you can wait for your function to finish and then use the result. I have updated your gist here: [https://gist.github.com/iStefo/1868c80ad694efef76f689ef52984ee4](https://gist.github.com/iStefo/1868c80ad694efef76f689ef52984ee4)
ok awesome thank you! just to clarify, no matter how long the count method will take, anything dispatched to the main thread after the count method will wait for the count method to complete before continuing? could you explain why please
Well, all lines of the program are executed sequentially, each one waiting for the line above to finish. The exception is when using an async dispatch. So the dispatch to main queue will only be executed after countTo has finished. Don’t be mistaken: the main queue *will* execute other code while countTo is running, but just not any code from the very block we are talking about which is currently busy executing countTo. I hope that makes sense :)
Okay I think I understand thanks a lot! 
LLDB doesn't really stand for *"low level debugger"*. AFAIK it's just a shared prefix with LLVM. 
&gt; As for the Shared scheme, you can check the xcscheme file into your source control. Yes, that's my point. In order to use this tool to analyze a project, I have to modify (the directory structure of) the project. I'm sure there's a technical reason that makes this implementation easier, but from the user's perspective it seems unnecessary. 
Especially when you involve closures, protocols and cross-module calls, Swift stack traces have a lot of noisy calls which are just "I'm calling this thing again but with a slight variation on the calling convention details". This is an Xcode UI issue, IMO, as these calls are useful to compiler engineers but not so much to people who just want to use the language. Objective-C and C and C++ don't have these type of frames. I have no idea what you're doing to get Xcode to step through assembly if you're not explicitly asking for it by Ctrl-clicking the step controls.
There's a valid technical reason, yes. But fortunately I just a found a way to work around it. Next version won't require schemes to be shared.
I think you’re probably looking at it wrong. The call stack is (somewhat awkwardly) in a drop down list, not a list view like in visual studio. Once you get the hang of things you’ll find that Xcode does some things better and visual studio does some things better. You’re just more comfortable (currently) in visual studio. I’m also guessing you’re using Swift. Swift does some name mangling like c++. This makes things compatible with straight C, but the name mangling makes it confusing when you don’t know what to look for while debugging. This will get better. Swift is still very new compared to c#, and it takes fundamentally different approaches to how things should work at a low level. IMHO for the better, but I’m not trying to start a flame war.
Can you give examples of what you're seeing? Swift call stacks don't seem bad at all, compared to some languages.
I haven't programmed on a notebook in a LONG time, but with that budget you'll be a bit hard pressed to get any notebook that works really well. What I did was built a Hackintosh from a windows PC. I bought a new MB, CPU, graphic card and RAM. The machine is about 9 years old and running very strong! If you need portable, I'd get a windows laptop and convert it to a Hackintosh. I would Google which laptops convert to Hackintosh best and get the most powerful one you can afford. Past that, I'd look at upgrades like SSD and more ram. [http://protechlists.com/hackintosh\-laptops/](http://protechlists.com/hackintosh-laptops/)
You’ll get more bang-for-your-buck with a Mac Mini if you don’t need a portable computer. Even buying the second tier Mac Mini, buying a decent monitor, and upgrading to an SSD yourself will cost you a little less and give you a better machine than the base MacBook Air.
The Mac Mini was terrible when it came out. Four years later, the spinning hard drives choke to death trying to run High Sierra. I had to tear my father's apart and install a SSD due to it being so trash.
Yes, but install an ssd and it has better specs than the Air at a cheaper price, even accounting for the monitor and ssd.
You can pretty much use any Mac that can run [macOS High Sierra](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP765?locale=en_US). An SSD would be nice, as would at least 8GB RAM.
Adding a question to this, is there a a way to see the value of a variable during runtime?
Get a used Mac. I picked up 2 used cheese grater Mac Pros for 700 bucks and have 24 cores in one of them. Mac Minis are overpriced. Macbook Airs suck and the screens are too small. You really need at least 16 GB of RAM and an SSD to use Xcode.
Go to the Breakpoint navigator and click the *+*, select *Exception Breakpoint…". It defaults to breaking on all exceptions.
&gt; Objective-C don't have these type of frames. ooh so this is why I didn't get this thread.

It now does run without crashing! The results are just as I expected: technically true, but not really useful. For example: - The convention in Swift is to make the first entry of an OptionSet to be `none`, which is the empty set for those options. In some cases I don't actually use this value yet, and Periphery flags it. It's true it's not used, but I'm not going to delete it. - In some cases I've replicated a UIKit interface (in an extension), because the AppKit version doesn't yet support something I need, and that included a `static let` that isn't used except in the interface. Again, I see no benefit to removing that. - There's some cases where it flags what I'd consider a borderline false positive. For example, `protocol P { func foo() throws }`, and `class C: P { func foo() throws { throw .notSupported } }`, and Periphery flags C's foo() as unused. That's sort of true, but to remove it, I'd first have to un-conform to P. Even though I don't use C as a generic P, I don't want to do that. It belongs in this folder with the other classes that conform to P, and it implements all the other functionality of P. It would be weird to define "class C (which isn't really a P, even though it's 90% the same as all the other P's here)". The correct solution is probably to split P into P1/P2, so this C can conform to just P1 (and the other 10 can conform to P1+P2), but that starts to become a design change, and not a simple matter of deleting unused code. And so on. In the end, there's nothing here that I would consider actionable. There's no dead code it found (in the 25% that the free version reports) that was at all surprising to me, or whose deletion would improve my codebase. Thanks for all the bug fixes, though, and good luck! 
Watch?
This isn't actually a problem. What is happening is that you're trying to load the root of the web service – `/`. But the web service that Apple designed for this application doesn't have anything at that location, so you are getting a 404 error, which means that it can't find what you are looking for. The application actually loads things from `/categories` and `/menu` instead. If you put `http://localhost:8090/categories` or ``http://localhost:8090/menu` into Chrome, you'll see the JSON come back that the application is expecting.
A lot of people are not big fans of buying used computers but in this case I think your best option is to get a 1-2 year old MacBook Pro (which you'll just barely be able to find for under $1000 with some looking). I'm writing this from a used MBP purchased from Swappa actually. Here's a few options to get you started: https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2017-13-notouch https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2016-13-notouch Currently the cheapest is 1050 but less than perfect model cosmetically could fit your budget. I use this laptop for work. It's an excellent little machine. Probably worth nothing these are USB-C/Thunderbolt only machines, not USB-A native so keep that in mind for monitor/keyboard/mouse/external drive connectivity. Or the previous generation (lots of acceptable options under $1000): https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2015-retina-13 Do you have a large monitor currently? Strongly recommend getting a 24 - 27 inch monitor if you can (or two 21" monitors, may actually be cheaper). Lots of screen space is more important than a 1-2 year age and performance difference in the computer itself (IMO - maybe debateable). You obviously *can* do software development with just a laptop but it's not the funnest thing. Good luck! I think with a little patience and research you can definitely put together a good Swift workstation on that budget.
New, yes. Used, it's totally doable.
Agreed, definately go used. Can you really find cheese grater Mac Pros for $350? That actually sounds awesome and leaves plenty of budget for monitor and accessories.
Hey, zeValkyrie, just a quick heads-up: **definately** is actually spelled **definitely**. You can remember it by **-ite- not –ate-**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.

That is correct :-) As the countTo method is synchronous it will be executed before returning to the main thread.
Without knowing anymore context, usually you want to make sure all UI changes are on the main thread. You can wrap the ui changes in a Dispatch-async block to ensure that. Hopefully this helps. 
Nope, I only checked if the user was valid or not in welcome. I actually solved the problem by deleting the segues and redoing them. Thanks for your response though! 
It wasn't clear from your code since you were calling Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeListener({(auth, user) in both Welcome and Browse VC. But it's good to hear your issue is fixed!
Additionally you can setup shortcut keys to run the simulator, just google, Xcode run shortcut. I set mine up to be cmd + r.
Are you going to use the YouTube apis to do so? YouTube makes money by running ads on their videos. If you follow their directions, it should be no problem. If you bypass their system in any way to allow for music streaming in the background, it will be against their TOS. The legalities are all outlined in their Terms of Service but a good rule of thumb is, if you are doing something not documented by then, you are probably breaking their TOS.
Yes, I would follow any guidelines just so I can create the app legally. I'm not trying to make a penny off the app. I will look into using their api thanks for your suggestion
I'll check it out thank you :\)
It's on one person's phone. The time frame is three weeks. The app can be bare bones, it just has to work. For some this is really simple, but for me, I have no idea where to start.
Thanks! Do you mind PMing?
Thank you for the input! 
Depends what changes you’re referring to.. if these changes are to a a uiview or some element that inherits from uiview such as a button or whatever... In that case you could make custom classes for each element you want to view changes for and make @IBDesignable and/or @IBInspectable. Either way if you’re a noob then having a read about these two attributes won’t do any harm. It enables them to be rendered in interface builder, you can also update properties in code and see near live updates without having to run simulator. 
So if i make a code change while the simulator is running all I need to do is close the app and reopen and I will see those new changes? I think I tried this and it did not work for me.
Yes. Run (command-R) will compile the new changes, quit the running app on the simulator, upload the new coders the simulator, and run it. 
Go back to Xcode and hit Command + . (Same function as the "Stop" button at top left", then Command + R (Same function as the Play button) and it will reinstall on the Simulator (That is still running).
No, you need to re-compile your app and launch it on the simulator again. You can keep the same simulator window open the entire time though, just hit the run button again in Xcode. Unfortunately it's not like webdev with hot reload.
And yet there are plenty of apps that do it and no one cares.
The creators of those apps are legally exposed if they are breaking YT TOS. Probably nobody cares because they do not get enough usage for it to be worth anyone’s time to care.
True
No need! It works now! Weirdly though it was blank but matching the colours of the rest of the screenshot
Get a used macbook pro 13 with an SSD and like 8-16gb, more the better. For getting your first job it'll be more than enough. Check if the screen has been replaced by apple (coating issues) and try a few benchmarks on it just to see that it doesn't turn off in high pressure and that's it. 
Not to be a Dick, but isn’t that the default?
It's a good idea to post your code so that we can see exactly what you're doing and then comment on it. There's a few ways to accomplish what you're saying. (Please post text, not images.) I think in your case the animation returns quickly and releases its ownership so a retain cycle is not likely. See this Stack Overflow answer which might be relevant: [Retain cycle with strong reference to dispatch_queue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46213399/887210)
Yes, totally confused running the app with resetting the simulator. I set a shortcut key on the sim to quickly reset if I need to. 
Wouldn't the countTo method be asynchronous since it's called in the async background thread?
Oh nice that’s clever! I should do that for the new user flow I’m working on. Would save me a good amount of time. 
Animation blocks and GCD blocks are two different things. Generally, however, you won't see a cycle in those scenarios because the reference isn't maintained beyond the single call of the closure. Once that's complete the reference is gone.
Thank you! This will be a big help
Hello, Animation Blocks, GCD, or any closure or block that is immediately executed will cause a retain cycle for a very short amount of time (milliseconds). Execution happens very fast and the block is deallocated after it runs, so we don't normally need to worry about very very short retain cycles. 
Not what I was expecting. Pleasantly surprised. What about alamofire, SwiftJSON and object mapper? 
Sent you a PM. 
No problem, let us know if you have any other questions along the way.
You’re probably better off waiting until closer to Halloween to promote this. At this time of the year I’m just not excited for it (and Halloween is one of my favorite holidays). You have a typo in one of your screenshots. (“Treat” is misspelled as “teat.” I pointed this out in your last thread.) In your screenshot showing a sample map, the location of the haunted house is actually a parking lot. It would be more relatable if you chose a real suburban location or created a fake map that looked more like a suburb.
Thanks, this alone is helpful. And yes i understand about the Halloween excitement issue. It's fine. I need to have the app submitted to Apple far before Halloween to ensure it makes it to the app store on time. So I know it will be an uphill climb to get testers. I appreciate your thoughts.
Hi there! I’ve been learning using swift playground and I’m trying to figure out an issue with some code I just wrote for it, may I send you a pm about it?
Depends on the size. If it's a few lines of code use the same. If not there's some sort of naming convention to call it `BaseClass+Protocol`.
&gt; especially if you're associated with a big company like VISA. Where did you get that they were associated with Visa? They've just slapped a Visa gift card graphic on their page. 
Sure, either point me to the Github or zip it and send it to me. jimistephen@gmail.com 
Why would people think that in the first place though? Is it solely because of the Flutter hype?
Thanks for the insight
So what you're asking is: Since these two guys stole and got away with it, can I do the same?
what i gathered is that the guy with the thumb down asked some friends in "top companies" and they said they weren't making any native apps. 
Maybe the problem is he's talking to big companies doing CRUD applications all of the time instead of startups still pushing the envelope. People are not doing AR or image filters in JavaScript. Or I must be completely underestimating the great C/C++ interop capabilities of Dart? In my opinion Swift on the server is not really going to happen unless some major players get behind it and roll out a solid infrastructure in terms of frameworks and tools. This could be IBM but who knows.
Native app development is losing market share to cross platform tools like React Native (which is not native), Xamarin, and Cordova on Mobile, and Electron on desktop. The number of native apps is decreasing while non-native apps are increasing, across all platforms, mobile and desktop. Taken in isolation, it would seem that Swift is losing market share, whereas the reality is that it’s really happening to all platforms. This doesn’t mean that native is going away any time soon, but it’s not going to stop clueless dweebs from drawing false conclusions either.
Is there a possible leap back to native once the limitations of non-native apps are realized? 
Not exactly. I don't plan on violating any of YouTubes TOS. I'm just baffled at how these two apps are still in the app store when they have so many users/downloads. But I should be fine with my use case as long as I follow the youtube guidelines for streaming videos with their api?
Actually according to app figures it’s actually going the exact opposite way, hybrid apps are declining. https://blog.appfigures.com/ios-developers-ship-less-apps-for-first-time/
Flutter is significantly different in the sense that it is using its own rendering engine written in C++ that compiles directly to native code. All the widgets you use have essentially been reverse engineered to look like the original platform widgets. Performance is never really an issue with it. My main gripe is that iOS widgets aren’t as fleshed out as the Material Design widgets so it’s easy to make your apps look way too “androidy”. Also the app size is pretty big right now, but that’s because they haven’t optimized for it yet and should get better. If it ever hits 1.0 and gets enough third party support it will actually be a viable cross tool that is better than both React Native and Xamarin, imo.
Honestly, who even cares what these videos say? If you have something to say, back it up with facts and code not talking heads. I feel these kinds of videos just exist to drive page ranks and revenue. Something I could read in a few minutes takes a video many more times that to get its point across. No thanks. 
Is the size really *that* big? I mean, in my own apps, it's a roughly 6MB size increase, which is sizable but not too bad. At this point IMO the main barrier to 1.0 is waiting for Dart 2 to be official. 
It’s not big enough to lose sleep over, but is something to consider. Dart 2 will be super nice once it’s official. I’ve had lots of problems with the compiler expecting a “new” keyword where it’s not necessary.
Er. People *ARE* doing AR and image filters in JavaScript. The whole WebGL push places more of the tools within reach of JavaScript. The heavy GPU intensive applications, like TensorFire, are experimental in an environment that transfers them to mainstream within six months. The coding aspect of the applications takes a smaller percentage of overall effort each year. It decreases as testing, market testing, graphical design, and UX increase. Performance is usually an afterthought: most speedups come from linking in the same natively compiled libraries. Regardless of the language of code, the goal of the library interface (API) is to be language agnostic at a correct level of abstraction. Consider the abstractions of TensorFire. It codes to any browser supporting WebGL, speeding up on those with decent GPUs. This means a farm of parallel trainers are managed by just pointing the machines at URLs. It seems hideously inefficient, but 99.9% of the processing time is in that inner back-prop training loop for which runs efficiently on the GPU. All the other overhead goes to zero by comparison. Swift advanced some ideas with Optionals and shortcutting certain errors in a syntax friendly way. It is always a reasonable bet that any given version will die -- what will Swift evolve or revolutionize into? 
Maybe we're talking about different things, but at this moment AR in optimized code in my opinion is not even good enough but getting there, doing it in JavaScript is slower and because of that even less useful. Same for real-time filters. Things like that just look nicer with higher FPS, more details, better face tracking and better physics. You can't eternally offload everything to external libraries without feeling a performance hit by not working with languages that are closer to the metal. JavaScript has come from very far but before it will become what native code does now it will have completely changed to something unrecognizable and in my opinion nothing but a compile target rather than the language you will actually write your code in. More similar to IML than human readable code, equal to C# or Java performance.
Non native development is increasing but their market share is not. It's just that more people are trying these new frameworks like back in the days when people were testing out Cordova before realizing it was a fucking garbage waste of time. If you're making shit apps, you've always been able to use Cordova and the shit frameworks around it though, now you just have a larger variety of shit frameworks to choose from. 
They've got a bunch of giant VISA logos on the page, above even the title or description or picture of the app. They specifically brag that the $100 you could earn comes in the form of a VISA card. What else would I assume? Why would anyone make their app webpage look like a VISA commercial, if it weren't?
Please stop. We don't need every random YouTube war repeated here. Nobody on r/swift was seriously afraid that Swift was "dying".
There's lots of little tasks on bugs.swift.org just waiting for some bored Swift programmer to jump in and help out! :-)
There's definitely some churn as developers try out hybrid frameworks then switch back to native. Sometimes it's a business strategy. The app will be built using non-native framework to get market quickly, which gives the business time to rebuild the native app. It would seem that the developers did a reversal, meanwhile it was the plan all along. The general trend seems to be an increase in non-native apps. If you try to predict how apps will be made 2 to 5 years from now, would you guess that the percentage of non-native apps would increase or decrease? Common sense would say that businesses choose whatever is most cost effective, in terms of development cost vs. income generated from the app. Over time as hybrid app frameworks and hardware improves, non-native apps become more viable, and it makes sense that businesses would reduce costs by not having to build the same app for each OS.

Stefan Mishook, the guy who says Swift is going to become a niche language, is not wrong. Swift is already a niche language. It's unlikely to ever replace C, C++, Java, or Python. Swift is good, but it's not enough of an improvement over existing languages to make it worth undoing decades and millions of dollars that companies have invested in those languages. Swift is not objectively faster than C, more versatile than C++, more malleable than Python, more ubiquitous than Java. Swift might have a chance at becoming the lingua franca, but it would need to do a few things first: 1. Run everywhere, including the browser. JavaScript already has that covered, so the next best thing would by being a great language to develop WebAssembly with. Technically this is possible, but the aesthetics of the developer tools and the environment, such as the package management system, make a big difference. Swift still has a long way to go. 2. Have an IDE that runs everywhere, or at least have toolchain that can be made to run everywhere. That means not having a single, stodgy, broken IDE that only runs on one OS that only runs on hardware from a single manufacturer. Xcode is Swift's Achilles heel. If anything is standing in the way of Swift's wide adoption, it's the dependency on Apple's ecosystem. Understandably Apple relishes locking developers into the platform, but at the same time, this is also restricting Swift's growth potential. 3. Have a great standard runtime library. Swift is built to run on Apple's operating systems. Some of Foundation has been open sourced and ported, but there's a lot that still does not work, and even more that still needs to be done. Compare Swift's libraries with Python or Dart. This can only happen by community contributions, which won't happen until Swift is available to a wide audience of developers, and not just people using an Apple OS to develop for an Apple OS. There's more to it, such as also having a hackable compiler (meaning one that doesn't take hours to compile), stable ABI (still to come), language interoperability, This is not to say that being a niche language is necessarily a bad thing. Even if Swift stays confined to Apple's ecosystem there will always be reason to keep using it. I think Stefan's assumption that Flutter (or something like it) can completely replace Swift is misguided. Even if Flutter lives up to they hype, there will still be reason to use Swift. Flutter inevitably needs to use the native system, which means having to write native code, using Objective-C, C, C++, or Swift. I think it's unreasonable to expect Flutter to implement all platform features equally, and sufficiently large hybrid apps will need to have native implementations for some features. Flutter, or any other third party framework, will always be a step behind, at least until the platform makers decide to support it. In Apple's case, it makes little sense that they would support a competitor's (Google) framework (Flutter), language (Dart), and design aesthetic (Material), while trying to push their own (Swift). The only way I see Flutter killing Swift, is if Apple partners with Google to make Flutter a first class language on Apple devices. Likewise, Swift's future outside of Apple will only happen by Apple releasing their exclusive ownership of the language.
+1 A languages success is nearly independent of how good it is and 100% dependent on tooling and libraries. Swift has 0 support anywhere outside of iOS and macOS. And it likely never will. It will always thrive on iOS but will flounder elsewhere. 
Like this you mean ? [barcode lookup](https://www.barcodelookup.com/api)
Those 3 seem to be on the way out. JSON is now a single line of code in Swift, I don't think Object Mapper is needed any more but I haven't specifically checked that one. I asked about Alamofire a few weeks ago and most think it's dead. The problem is that these 3rd party add ons have a place when they start, then Apple adds that functionality into the base product. I can say that 2 of those 3 have been replaced with the base product from Apple.
I’m a huge fan of server-side Swift after playing with it. There are good frameworks like Perfect or Vapor that provide great functionality, especially for REST services. The performance is great, especially compared to Node or Java. But you’re right, there needs to be a richer ecosystem. 
To be fair, he probably gets a lot of robospam and this adds an obstacle. But there’s 100 ways to stop spam without adding a pay wall. 
Have you asked them? Good place to start.
yes. No answer.
Thanks everyone for your help!!!!
great thanks
&gt; People ARE doing AR and image filters in JavaScript. People also pierce their dick.
How about connecting a Swift app to this tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7NVpxxmmgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7NVpxxmmgM) It's at video # 5, but hasn't got to the connection between an app and the backend. I'm following so many tutorials and wanted to finish this one off. Something like keys, access tokens, oAuth...
Right next to the visa logo it says &gt;"Enter for a chance to win a $100 Visa Gift Card If you deck out your home for Halloween, show off and enter for a chance to win" The App Store image says "Available Soon". Can you please identify the exact *"4 or 5 of their marketing requirements"* that we are violating? Beyond the text at the top of the page explaining the **Contest** is even more text below such as &gt;ENTER FOR YOUR CHANCE TO WIN A $100 VISA GIFT CARD The outside of your home, office or apartment building will be featured on the Halloween Map with a special icon showing it off as a great place to trick or treat. Upload photos from past years by filling out this form Do you suggest that we need a disclaimer saying "No affiliation with Visa .. blah blah blah" ??
If it uses BTLE you are fine. If it uses classic Bluetooth you need to enter the MFi program, which is a pain in the neck. 
Can everything be done with BTLE?
As long as you are designing the module to support BTLE, you should be fine. I think BTLE is still slower than classic Bluetooth, but I haven't been keeping up with the standard. On the plus side, it uses less power. 
One thing that works against that is the time to rewrite the code. Just as much as some argue the benefits of one source for two platforms being less code, moving from native to cross to native and back to cross is just making a lot of wasted code.
Thank you so much~!
Why are you building out a server yourself? Is there something that Realm or Firebase doesn't give you that you're looking for or are you just trying to do it to practice doing it?
Yes, you can do localized distribution through configuration profiling.
Quite a few jobs have been looking for "full stack" and I also know RDBMS very well. My background is client server enterprise systems and I'm now targeting mobile enterprise. Building a server from zero is just the way I've always done things.
This is the key difference, though strictly speaking it's not a cycle. ``` DispatchQueue.main.async { self.doSomething() } ``` is not a retain cycle, because `self` doesn't own `DispatchQueue.main`. The block *does* keep `self` alive until it is executed, though. You're 100% right that lifetime is the important factor. `DispatchQueue` is only going to keep the block alive until it is executed. And if it never runs your block, you probably have a much bigger problem than a memory leak.
&gt; I was literally going to comment about the millions of lines of COBOL still in production today, Millions? So there's only one COBOL program left? Cool.
Yes, this is possible if you have subscribed to Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Or you can just distribute it as beta, for example with Fabric+Crashlytics, but it also has some limitations (e.g. about how many devices you can add to your developer account).
I don’t like it because it uses strings to initiate navigation. Which is error prone. The data it passes along is also not strongly typed since the dictionary is of type [String : Any]. 
It might be out of your field of knowledge, but I thought I'd toss it out there. I'm looking at web dev to make APIs and haven't gotten to the point of setting up the connection between the mobile app and the backend. IDK if he's going to cover that or not, he's moved on to Flutter tutorials.
An appe?
&gt; u have to you* Spell the words.
&gt; All languages start off obscure, rise to niche and then go from there Some do. Not all. &gt; Swift, being entirely open source, has a good chance of expanding to the server as a next step. Server capabilities are being developed with Apple's blessing and currently largely being driven by IBM's partnership and investment. Apple still decides where the language is used, far more than the community does. Hopefully this will change. &gt; It's taking some work but there are a lot of iOS developers who like the idea of using the same language on the back and front end. That's still serving the niche of iOS development. Swift backends are largely going to serve Swift iOS apps for the majority. It's going to be hard to convince stakeholders to use Swift as a backend for other platforms. Java developers would rather use Kotlin because it's part of the ecosystem which they already use. University students are likely to learn Dart instead of Swift if it means a better chance at getting a job at Google. &gt; New languages do not get popular through the incumbent, established systems. Sure they do. Java replaced COBOL for mainframes and C++ for web services and desktop apps. A lot of code written in those languages was replaced by Java, even with the decades of time and millions of dollars invested in them. C++ and COBOL still exist and are widely used, but are not as much as they would be if Java did not exist. Java is already being superseded by JavaScript and Python. What benefit would Swift bring that those other languages do not already offer, on top of widespread adoption and a thriving ecosystem? 
Welcome to Reddit, where "u suck" is a better comeback than a reasoned argument. Non-native will lag. It won't always suck. Neither of these are by definition of being non-native, they're by definition of not being supported by Apple.
To me it really depends on the application and market, for basic form\-type applications things like reactive native can be a lifesaver. Personally though I always think applications like that would be better suited for the web \(PWAs now\) and would prefer for that route to become more popular and saving the app stores for richer more interactive applications 
I get a anti-native sentiment mid-level managers who don't understand technology, but who are responsible for technical decisions. They'll watch Stefan's video and use it as a basis for justifying something like Cordova. It's good that a rebuttal exists to put the brakes on when it does crop up.
&gt; Apple still decides where the language is used, far more than the community does. Apple decides because Apple chose to. Being open source, anyone can take Swift and decide to do something else. Apple having the will is not the same as Apple having control. &gt;That's still serving the niche of iOS development. It was an impetus for it to grow outside it's original scope, not an argument as to why it's not a niche. That said, iOS development is an awfully big niche. &gt; It's going to be hard to convince stakeholders to use Swift as a backend for other platforms. Again, the growth will not come from incumbent, established systems, but from the new. For example, many now popular social media platforms started on iOS. Any new ones in the next few years could now theoretically have a Swift backend. &gt;University students are likely to learn Dart instead of Swift if it means a better chance at getting a job at Google. Perhaps. Or perhaps it's because Dart has been out longer, is a more stable language, and been able to be incorporated into the syllabi of universities. And I assume you mean Universities in the US. I've never seen, nor taught a course that touches Dart in Australia. &gt;Sure they do. Java replaced COBOL for mainframes and C++ for web services and desktop apps. But were the languages replaced on incumbent, established systems? That is, was there a company with a large mainframe running COBOL and they decided to replace that software with Java? Or, as my experience tells me, do they just leave the well tested, functional code running and not take the risk on a rewrite? &gt;What benefit would Swift bring that those other languages do not already offer, on top of widespread adoption and a thriving ecosystem? No benefit is required, only familiarity. Do you know one of the big reasons Java is so popular these days? Because it's one of two native languages used for mobile apps. It's slap bang in the middle of a dynamic, exciting, profitable in a winning-the-lottery kind of way market. Just like Swift.
In some cases the business doesn't depend directly on the app. Think of a bank, or an online retailer. Their app can be poor, but will still be used by their customers who have no other choice. Some code bases are kept alive long past their expiry date. Sometimes they start out as a prototype that's never quite finished, and kept in a semi-dying state for years. At some point the technical debt becomes unsustainable and the developer's are forced to rewrite the app. At this point some clueless soul, with "chief" or "manager" in their title, pipes up and says: "I know, how about React/Cordova/Xamarin!"
The gist is, I don't think Swift is going away any time soon. I also don't think it's going to be as ubiquitous as JavaScript or Java is today, unless Apple changes their stance. I would love to be wrong. I write Swift code for a living, and I have enjoyed the benefits of being in a niche market so far, although it would also be great if my skills are in even higher demand in the future. I guess time will tell.
&gt; ...unless Apple changes their stance. What on Earth is wrong with their stance? At the moment it's basically: "Here, it's open source. Do whatever you want and we're happy to take suggestions. We're also working on making it work server side ourselves."

The language yes, the tools and libraries not so much. Pop quiz: - What’s the best IDE to use if you’re not on a Mac. Nothing is really well supported, and Xcode is not cross platform. - You want to write your Android / Desktop app in Swift, what do you use for the UI / calling system libraries. There’s demand for Swift on other platforms, but it goes against Apple’s culture. Imagine if Apple announced official support for writing Swift for Android. It would be a game changer. Technically possible even today, but how likely is that to happen? Sure the community could build this stuff over time, but what’s their incentive for doing using Swift instead of something else. 
&gt; it uses strings to initiate navigation true. Looks like they could probably just pass Type instead
I think you've confused Swift being comparatively new with Apple being a dick. Swift is open source, as is LLVM and Clang. Now you want an IDE and UI libraries for Android? Open source doesn't mean "We're going to do all the work you want for you. Just sit back and relax". Open source means "You want something else? Feel free". Only Apple could get criticised for their open source "stance". How dare they give us the labour of their software engineering for free, empower us to take it further and give us complete free reign to do so. The goddamned *nerve* of those people. 
Nope, I just realise there's more to the success of a language, than just the language itself. A language thrives or dies by it's ecosystem which includes amongst other things, the ability to use whatever OS you have to write and run code. Apple will need to invest in some of this stuff until the language gains enough critical mass to sustain new growth. I'm not saying they need to make a cross platform IDE, but putting some resources behind Atom or VSCode would help. They don't need to go and build CoreGraphics and AutoLayout for Android, but they could have officially supported language bindings. These things are less technical / resource problems, than they are strategic ones.
I still think you've confused Swift being comparatively new with Apple being a dick. Give it time.

I've been there. One startup I was at during the DotCom era had tech that was so old that it took us about a year to find someone to program it an the people we got in didn't have a clue. It was a database language and the "programmers" we got from the head hunters couldn't even open a database on a network.

Having a place in code to represent all possible routes will happen regardless weather the data is represented as an enumeration or a string, because either way that data needs to be represented client side. Having them represented as an enumeration makes it impossible for you to pass an unknown route, where passing a string you can easily introduce typos and point users to routes that don’t even exist. 
You'll want to create another class to help with this. Let's say you call it something like `UserAPI` or `UserHelper` or even `Session`. You can have a class function in here that will return your `User`. This can then be called from anywhere in your app. `UserAPI.user()`. Inside this class is where you can do the work to pull a saved user from `UserDefaults`. This same class could also be used to pull user data from firebase and store it in `UserDefaults` on app launch. 
How many people? I'm not 100% sure since I've had a developer account for a long time but you *may* need a developer account to build for a device and create an archive. If you have an archived build, you can distribute up to 100 copies for each device type (iPhone, iPad) that will only load on a subset of device UDIDs. If each person sends you their device UDIDs, you can enter them in your developer account's valid devices for a provisioning, make an archive with that provisioning profile and then they will need to install. We used to do this by emailing an archived app as an .IPA through email, or by letting internal users download the IPA from an internal web site and then synching the IPA to the user's device through iTunes. I'm not sure what the process is now.
You can use enterprise distribution or configurator. There are several methods which is why I posted no link. It’s easily searchable.

Last month I released interactive playgrounds demonstrating all the new features in [Swift 4.1](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-4-1) and [Swift 4.2](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-4-2). Because Swift continues to change quickly, I even launched a new site: [What’s new in Swift?](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com/) – I'll be keeping that up to date in the future. I also started a new endeavor: posting a new Swift tutorial every day until WWDC starts. You can track my progress at [Countdown to WWDC](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/72/countdown-to-wwdc-18), but here are a selection of the articles that you might be interested in: - [How to use the coordinator pattern in iOS apps](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps) - [Server-side Swift: Kitura vs Vapor](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/73/server-side-swift-kitura-vs-vapor) - [Controlling extension points in protocols](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/75/controlling-extension-points-in-protocols) - [How to find and fix slow drawing using Instruments](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/79/how-to-find-and-fix-slow-drawing-using-instruments) - [How to use @available to deprecate old APIs](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-available-to-deprecate-old-apis) - [How to test your user interface using Xcode](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/83/how-to-test-your-user-interface-using-xcode) - [How to move data sources and delegates out of your view controllers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/86/how-to-move-data-sources-and-delegates-out-of-your-view-controllers) So, this month I’ll mostly be continuing that work – there are still quite a few days until WWDC hits, so I have a lot of writing to do! PS: If there's something specific you'd like me to write about as a Countdown to WWDC article, just let me know!
Do you have any experience with ARKit or SpriteKit? That would be a great article.

The guidelines say not to modify the App Store button. Apple gives you the graphics somewhere (sorry on mobile). I don’t think it’s as big of a deal as the other comments, but you’re not supposed to do it

I'm learning Server Side Swift in the form of Vapor. I will be working on closing in on finishing my first app and shipping it. Right now I'm working on learning more about PromiseKit. I just had finished with setting up my own Jira + Agile server, along with my own GitLab server for source control.
