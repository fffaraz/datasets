It turns out I had mixed up some variables. It should be `FileManger.default.contentsOfDirectory' and not fileManager.contentsOfDirectory. 
I didn't know there was a chat feature :(

I worked with my iPT that I got in 2009/2010 when I started. I just upgraded to an iPhone6S for the ARKit, 3D touch and other things. What I found over the years is that it's really cool for your apps to run on a phone... but most of the work isn't tested on the phone unless you have certain types of apps. Camera, vision, ARkit, etc... ok... Otherwise I use the sim. Apple isn't shy about wanting your money, I was pissed when the iPT was left behind for a LONG time, then pretty much dumped. The iPT was a go to device for testers. Now the older iPhones are actually cheaper. The mini, pad, etc... that's an expense I don't need, you can layout on the sim and the code for the camera should be the same. Businesses can expense all they want, indies can't.
If you have an iPad the Swift Playgrounds are a fun, animated way of getting a grasp of the basics although I found it a bit cumbersome coding on an iPad. I then moved onto the books provided by apple - Intro to App Development with Swift and then App Development With Swift. I found there to be a lot of crossover between the two books so you could probably skip the intro book. I am now following Angela Yu's iOS bootcamp on Udemy which I am enjoying and really recommend. I got it for less than £10 so if you want to pick one of their courses up make sure you keep an eye on Udemy's sales which happen very frequently.
I really liked iOS course by Mike Price from Devalopes. Check it on udemy, wait for some promo sale. It’s a really great course and helped me a lot. 
I agree the Apple written books you mention are a great starting point! I teach an intro swift course and we use those as resources. I also recommend the websites you mentioned - RW and HWS cover a lot of ground and have great examples, mostly for free. 
I remember issues like innacesible objects/firing 😞
I remember issues like innacesible objects/firing 😞
That’s incredibly similar to my journey. I started in January this year with iPad playgrounds, and soon got tired of it as it was slow and cumbersome. I then moved to the Flatiron School’s swift course, which was ok but soon ended up in broken tutorials and github issues with the pull requests which were required to progress. Then I did the whole of Angela Yu’s Udemy course. Super fun, and absolutely loved it, it really gave me good foundations. Then I did Hacking with swift, Pro Swift, and now onto Swift Design Patterns (and 3 apps of my own in between). 
I used CD in a large project and I was having trouble with faults. It was years ago, IIRC, I couldn't access the data and I don't remember the fix. That's why I ask, I remember faults but I don't know if it's something you have to do something special with. I haven't seen faults in Firebase or Realm, but CD is still an important part of iOS.
I just looked it up and saw it’s on sale currently from $199.99 to $9.99. [Is this the course you’re talking about?](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) 
Second this, but you’ll probably want to learn some basics before hoping on this channel.
I can’t say much about this 
I put my code in Dropbox. Wait, wait, wait, I can explain! I put my git repositories so that my projects are always accessible on my desktop and laptop, in their latest versions. Otherwise I would have to make half-baked commits just to transfer my work, which was a pain in the ass itself. But when I forgot to do it before leaving home... well, that was no fun.

You should join a meetup or start one. That’s a good place to find a lot of people that support each other. If you’re in LA/SM, join our Learn Swift LA meetup. 
&gt; HTML is cool but it’s really a scripting language &gt; I’m a working professional web dev. (x) doubt
Lamba schools offers a free two week intro to iOS boot camp. I just took it and it’s a great way to start. 
Apple has some free books on iBooks 
There’s always a Stanford course in iTunes U
You should look at the [Navigation Controller](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller?changes=_4) and when you tap a cell do a push segue to another table view.
? 
It’s a markup language to render web pages not executable with logic and stuff like programming languages
Sure 
So, I know this isn't helpful, but I'm not sure at all what is wrong. I put your code into a playground in Xcode 9, and while it did require me adding a closing brace at the end of the file, everything else seemed to check out with regards to the protocol conformance. 
Yes that’s the one. If you don’t mind 10$ go for it. They also have a quite big discord group where you can get a lot of support. P.s. never buy anything on udemy for full price haha 
Its available on the App Store now. Enjoy! https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookplayer-audio-book-player/id1138219998?ls=1&amp;mt=8
It's a trailing closure. You can pass a final argument that's a closure outside of the parenthesis for the argument list. So instead of doing this: foo( a, closure: {} ) You can do this: foo(a) { } I think this was inspired by Ruby syntax...
Disclaimer: I don't have experience on Sprite Kit I searched Apple official documentation for the enumerateChildNodes function here : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/1483024-enumeratechildnodes . The `enumerateChildNode` function take in two parameters, `withName` and the closure (yes, the closure is the parameter passed into it). Normally you would do it like enumerateChildNodes(withName: "BADBOI", using: { (node: SKNode, nil) in ... }) Swift language has a shortcut for when a function take in a closure on the last (rightmost) parameter (the `using` parameter in this case), you can move it to the end of the function like this: // as a shortcut, you can move the last closure parameter to outside of function call enumerateChildNodes(withName: "BADBOI") { (node: SKNode, nil) in ... } Hope this helps! If you are interested to read in detail about this, I have written an overview about closure here : https://fluffy.es/closure-overview/#parameter
The ML in HTML literally means “markup language”. It is absolutely not a scripting language. 
Hi felixmaria! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift.

My bad. Corrected
&gt;teaching online course? 
that's very nice, thank you.
College. First classes were this week.
I would start off learning generalised programming fundamentals, it might seem basic but understanding the difference between an IDE and text editor is useful and so that you know the difference between a constant and variable. Then start reading the Swift documentation so that you get a grasp of the Swift language. You will be able to find a lot of YouTube videos providing information on Swift fundamentals (if you prefer video format). You will be able to learn this in the playgrounds. Once you're comfortable with the core concepts start looking for some courses, or guides so that you start creating projects and becoming familiar with Xcode and UIKit. I'd recommend the following: \- Standford course: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) \- Dev Slope Udemy: [https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) \- Angela Yu Udemy: [https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/) YouTube: \- Lets Build That App \- Jared Davidson \- Brian Advent Online reading: \- [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) \- [https://www.raywenderlich.com/](https://www.raywenderlich.com/)
Thanks!
Thank you!
This is great. I just joined. Thank you.
I’ve actually been using it a ton since the update especially! Fantastic application. Is there anything on the app which you’d like community help with?
And just to add to this, a closure is pretty much exactly like an unnamed function: closure: { (node: SKNode, nil) in if node.position.y &lt; -150 || node.position.y &gt; self.size.height + 150 { node.removeFromParent() } } function: func (node: SKNode, stop: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;ObjCBool&gt;) { if node.position.y &lt; -150 || node.position.y &gt; self.size.height + 150 { node.removeFromParent() } } 
Very nice!
This is awesome
So great to hear! If anyone feels like helping out, take a look at our current and upcoming milestones, write a comment and we’ll see how you can start contributing. Test the shit out of every feature and of course, having positive reviews on the App Store help a lot. We want to focus on accessibility so any feedback on things like VoiceOver or other parts are very welcome as well. And of course if you have feature requests we are always looking to improve 🙂
Glad to have you! 
As someone hoping to get in to the field eventually, thanks. 
&gt;hacking with swift nice find, didnt know about this, I am doing the Udemy iOS 11 course. Will be going to this also now.
Where exactly ware you getting this error? Is it a compiler error?
I've never heard of a situation in which an older gen processor is more performant under load than a new one that thermal throttles. If anything these packages have the same TDP, and would thermal throttle by the same percentage
Thank you!
The 7700HQ and 8950HK have the same 45 watt TDP, but the power consumption is much higher on the Coffee Lake CPUs. Performance per watt has been increased leading to greater heat output in an already thermally restricted chassis. My testing has shown the Core i9 being able to handle a synthetic CPU load while maintaining 2.9GHz, but that doesn’t include any GPU usage. If Xcode doesn’t max both the cpu and gpu, it shouldn’t throttle. 
How big is the project? My compiles don't take that long anymore since the Swift compiler got improved.
I think that is the wrong approach. The problem here is that people aren't familiar with one of the first things you should learn: pure functions. If your functions are pure(rer) then there's no need for functions that have a return value that you don't actually want.
Computers are fast now it’s not 2013. We haven’t needed to worry about specs on MacBook pros for awhile now 
There’s nothing wrong with this approach in my opinion. The thing is, this isn’t supposed to be used in 99% of your functions. It just fills a niche role where in some rare occasions it’s a nice to know. But I agree with you when you say people should be more informed about pure functions. One friend actually told me I should do a post about pure functions, side effects and SRP.
The error message looks like a good clue in this case. The sections are indexed from 0, so to insert a row into the first (and only) section build the index path with a section of 0 not 1: let indexPath = IndexPath(row: tableViewData.count - 1, section: 0)
Oh my gosh... you're right, that worked, thank you. Perhaps I was thinking that sections started at 1 instead of 0 for some reason.
Haha, are you working at Apple or what?
I’d love to read that :) Please message me if you ever do write that article.
At the moment the next two I’ve planned are related to help the overall experience when doing layouts by code and how to stop using useless container views. Also if you want to keep updated and never miss and article or videos related to an event called CocoaHeads Porto make sure you follow me at Twitter: www.twitter.com/pedrommcarrasco
Just Xcode itself is always running all kinds of BS as it tries to keep SourceKit from crashing :) Let alone compiling. I would probably not risk it with the i9, throttling is a fucking nightmare. It is the most frustrating fucking thing to have your fucking computer slow down to a crawl for reasons outside of your control. 
I think the use case for discardable results is something like networking where you have an object that can cancel, but in most cases, you won't end up using it and just use the callback.
There are some niche use cases indeed! :)
Will be doable. Just look at open source library Crypto for swift and encrypt everything when you write and decrypt when you read. The only tricky part you need to think about how you will exchange the keys with the user. Read up a bit on different AES encryption ciphers. You probably will want AES-CTR or AES-CBC. Good luck. 
Its mainly for learning swift. As far as for making apps, you can use it to test snippets of code. Thats at least how I see it so far, if anybody else has other uses, I'd like to know too.
What do you mean by pure functions?
Have you used AVPlayer in a UIViewController or an AVPlayerViewController as per your title? If it’s the latter I don’t think you’d be able to achieve this as you are not supposed to subclass AVPlayerViewController and I’m not sure how you’d be able to control the view hierarchy to achieve it. With an AVPlayer you could add a UICollectionView at the bottom easily, the more tricky part might be moving the playback controls up and getting the navigation to work correctly. Not sure as I’ve only ever used an AVPlayerViewController. 
Sorry, my bad, I used AVPlayer and tried with UICollectionView but I cant access playback controls.
The ABC News tvos app kind of does this with the live video. The gotcha they don't have player controls for the video. Try going with just a regular ol' UIViewController and embed a UIView that takes an AVPlayer. Then you can overlay a UICollectionView over the UIView and you should be good. 
It's a pretty awful API. I always try to use a wrapper around it. Every time I have to use it I have to slough through these annoying crashes again because it's just not intuitive.
Thank you. Will take a look at it. 
Thanks. I couldn't figure it out as well. I actually restarted the project from scratch and I'm not running into the error. 
Thanks. I will try this when I get a chance. I actually just rewrote the project from scratch (as I wanted to organize some parts better) and it seems to be working (the rewritten project) now. 
There you go buddy: “Pure functions are functions that do not possess any side effects; in other words, they do not change or alter any data or state outside of themselves. Additionally, they do not access any data or state except their provided parameters. Pure functions are like mathematical functions that are pure by nature. Pure functions return a value that is only determined by its parameter values. Pure functions are easy to test as they rely only on their parameters and do not change or access any data or state outside of themselves. Pure functions are suitable for concurrency as they do not access and change global data or states.”
You should check out all of the testing that's been going on regarding this situation, there's a few good posts on /r/apple. The i9 definitely throttles a ton more than the i7, to the point where the 7820hq in the 2017s are faster under sustained load that included ANY GPU stress at all. In a strictly CPU benchmark without spinning up the dGPU, you'll get better than 7820hq, but still less than the 8750h in the base model 2018. Coffee Lake throttles a lot heavier than their Kaby Lake counterparts. I could go really in-depth as to why, but it'd be a waste of time, as a lot of other people have made really good posts about it, like: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9090eh/whats_in_a_tdp_examining_the_thermal_issues_in/
BTW--You have an incorrect (or non-standard?) argument list for your closure. Use `_` for ignored parameters. So this: { (node:SKNode, nil) in ... } Should be { (node:SKNode, _) in ... } Also, Swift can determine the types of most variables and closure arguments without you having to specify them, so this probably works: enumerateChildNodes( withName: "BADBOI" ) { node, _ in ... } 
You'll have to post some of your code... Sounds like your tab controller is maybe inside your nav controller instead of the other way around?
Probably better to use let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "entryCell") as? EntryTableViewCell ?? EntryTableViewCell() instead of let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "entryCell")! as! EntryTableViewCell 
I was surprised to see that it works just fine like that but I guess it's valid. I would still use an underscore because it's much more common.
Writing code that appears to work is possible for a junior iOS developer. But getting it right... that's tough if you're not familiar with crypto. The very first problem is the hardest: How do the two users exchange keys securely? ECDH is a crypto algorithm that provides the technology to establish a shared key while only exchanging public data over the network. But how does Alice know that the's setting up a shared key with intended user Bob and not with evil user Mallory? The next problem is the actual crypto. I'd use AES256GCM rather than CBC because that adds integrity checking.
As a note, using this for UI testing has been extremely helpful. Many of our automation functions return values, but they aren’t always needed especially if we’re performing a quick smoke test.
Section 0.... 
There are cryptography libraries built on top of Swift but I'm not aware of one that specifically caters to chat platforms. If I'm wrong, then please let me know so that I can learn. The libraries I'm aware of merely provide cryptography features but there is more to securing chat than just encrypting a string. To properly secure chat you need to a way to securely share keys, [provide proof that who you are talking to is who they claim to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_millionaires), a way to provide [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), etc. I am personally a fan of the C library [libotr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) which is designed with all those in mind. When it comes to cryptography, there are many, many ways to get it wrong in subtle but dangerous ways. If you are going to implement encryption for a chat platform, then please read up as much as possible on the subject if you haven't already.
Well without seeing the agreements they are both just words, so couldn’t really say if it would be beneficial for you to change. My gut syays you would rather be an intern. 
Downvotes? Explain. Its really a lot faster
You should absolutely be concerned. The differences between being an actual employee and an independent contractor are vast. First of all, an independent contractor has far less legal protections in most jurisdictions. You can be fired more easily, they don't have to provide you with the same level of benefits, you aren't covered the same under their liability and other professional insurances. You'll have to file and handle the tax issues yourself. Generally, a company uses independent contractors as a way to trim their responsibilities down. They can make grand promises and then not deliver on them because many new independent contractors don't know how to get a proper legal and binding agreement. The company often has lawyers who are very good at writing these kinds of agreements to be against the contractor. The fact that they brought you in with the promise of an internship and then they pull a bait-and switch of "oh, you'd make a great independent contractor instead" speaks volumes to their intent. They probably planned this all along and are trying to play it up as a positive for you when there's pretty much no upside. Now, if you were a senior developer who was needed for a special project and you had years of experience at being an independent contractor then it would be a different story. You'd probably also have a lawyer to check the contract for you, you'd be able to demand proper compensation for not having health and other benefits that a permanent employee wound enjoy, they'd do what they could to accommodate your needs and keep you as long as they need your expertise. The balance of power would not be as tilted in their favor. Get a copy of that contract, have a lawyer look at it even if it costs you a bit of cash. It shouldn't be that much to consult one on this matter. Protect yourself, even the most benign company out there is going to very heavily stack the deck on their own side.
Oh that list is just hilarious! It's missing so many key Swift developers that you wonder how it was put together. It looks like someone just came across flashy UI implementations and said "ooo shiny!"
Agreed. The best developers are probably not necessary the ones making UI cocoapods. They are probably the people working on the compiler and doing more language specific tasks. Missing a LOT of notable people from the Swift.org forums. If this was framed as “list of developers and their contributions to open sourced cocoapods” that would be one thing. “Best developer” is just so wrong 
Some of those UI implementations are horrible too. Yeah they're flashy but if I saw them in a shipping app I'd delete it off my device in a hurry. A sure sign of a developer who values flash over substance. Use the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) folks.
When it was a bit more stable I used to use it when I would programmatically build UI. It’s been a waste of time lately.
Try using AVPlayerLayer. Just add your AVPlayer to AVPLayerLayer. AVPlayerLayer can be added to a view's background and you can layer controls on top. I find this much easier to work with for some reason.
Note they can choose your hours in some contracts, so your hourly rate may look amazing but they may only contract you 3 days a week. Also as others say, usually no benefits or protections. If you’re contracting to multiple companies it can work to your advantage as you’ll be pulling in money from multiple, equally risky companies.
A lot really depends on your location. If you work as a contractor and get paid as an intern- when you go to the next company they will want to pay you a similar wage.
You make have to create your own and adjust the position manually.

I believe Firebase is already end-to-end encrypted?
I recently discovered that i can import a playground file into an xcode project and test out any frameworks that are imported there. For example, Im using rentpath’s Atlas library to parse through json but something was failing. I imported a playground file, imported the Atlas framework and testing things put and found my solution.
This is interesting, my 1st thought is that contractor looks better on the resume. I'm guessing the internship was a paid one. My concern would be that as contractor, you're expected to know things, you're assumed to be a pro. As an intern, you're NOT expected to know things and are there to learn. It's kinda the bridge from student to professional where you get the real world experience. If you were qualified as an intern, you wouldn't be qualified as a professional. There should be a clear gap between the two. I would be concerned because you don't want a failure at this point. I can't see a valid reason for them wanting to do this other than costs and various legal reasons. It's a lot easier on a company to pay a contractor than it is to pay an employee. What size company is this and how long have they been around? Some startups use this as a way of stiffing someone for their work. They work you like a dog, at the end of a month they ask you to submit your invoice, then you get paid on it at the end of 30 days... next thing you know, you're 60+ days of work with no money to show for it. I've been there, had to sue some clients in order to get paid. As an employee, you have MUCH stronger rights to get paid. If they hire a bunch of people as contractors, they could stiff them all and save a TON on payroll.
Are you saying that the company was advertising for an internship position, selected you and now wants to pay you as an independent contractor for the internship period? If this is a student internship, that seems pretty normal. Students usually have health coverage already and are working for a fixed time (summer or a semester). Being an independent contractor does mean you have to pay employment taxes yourself, so set aside 30% or so. 
Read the above carefully and then get legal help. First thing to realize is that if you are going to be a contractor you will need to negotiate a wage rate at least double what you would like to take home. The reason is simple, you become responsible for taxes (you are effectively a business and should get such established legally), insurance and a host of other fees. You can easily see 50% of your wages going out the door in federal, state and local taxes if any, plus your insurance and incorporation fees and other business expenses. So if you think you can get by on $30 an hour (dirt cheap really) you need to be actually billing at $60 an hour. In any event do nothing until you get some information on how you would set up a business in your local. Look for SCORE seminars and similar programs aimed at people new to the business world. As for this company I'd run away as fast as possible, people that run bait and switch programs are never the type of people you want to be dealing with. This especially if the switch puts you in a really nasty position.
Most concerning are the liability issues. If you're an employee and something goes wrong with your code that results in a lawsuit you're fairly protected under the corporate umbrella. On the other hand, as a contractor you lose a lot of protections and can be held directly responsible for any legal issues that involve your code. To protect yourself you might have to get additional insurance, pay a lawyer, and so on.
Contractor really doesn't look better on a resume. I'd rather see that someone was an employee of a company than hire as a contractor, unless the work they did was very specialized and high-level. When I see that someone starting out was hired as a contractor it says to me that the company they worked for didn't have enough confidence in their work to make them a full employee.
I've never heard of this for student internships, at least not at a serious company. The only time I've seen this for a worker starting out it was usually at a pretty shady company. It's used as a dodge, a way to get workers but then be able to avoid paying them the benefits of a full employee and to be able to fire them easily when the work is done.
Yes, it's possible. :) I've done something similar recently. Here's the approach I took: Create your Firebase reference: &gt; let ref = Database.database().reference() **User 1** Create a new entry in the database for TestGroup: &gt;ref.child("TestGroup").setValue(true) Add the invited user's ID + group name to a list of invitations: &gt;ref.child("Invited").child("User2").setValue("TestGroup) **User 2** Make a variable to save the group name: &gt;var groupName = String() Listen for their ID in the invitations list: &gt; ref.child("Invited").child("User2).observe(.value). { (snapshot) in if snapshot.exists() { // Get the group name groupName = snapshot.value as? String } } User 2 sends their acceptance message: (if User1 needs to know when it's accepted, they can have an observer for this) &gt; ref.child(groupName).child("accepted").child("User2").setValue(true)
Looks like a different way of using it without adding side-effects to the main application functions. Would you mind commenting this in the post? So when people read the post they are able to see your idea &amp; usage :)
Avplayer does not provide controls on its own, so you’ll have to make them. As an aside, on tvOS, if avplayerviewcontroller is anything but the full display size, controls will appear but not be accessible. 
The reality is that you probably do not qualify as a contractor and the company is just trying to save money by not bringing you on board. Do your work. Look for another job where they value you.
Is a there a possibility OP is an intern who is being paid as an independent contractor for payroll purposes? Without knowing the terms of the contract, it is hard to say if it is exploitation. With every other post saying this is exploitation, I want to point out that this is not necessarily a bad situation—deciding this depends on details we don’t have. There is a big difference between paying a temporary student intern as an independent consultant and hiring starting positions as consultants. If the company is using consulting contracts for positions that should be permanent, that is definitely a warning sign. Another issue would be if the company calls starting programmers “interns”, and hires them on a semi-permanent basis, motivating them to accept low wages with promises of future advancement. (Whether as contractors or as hourly employees, this is exploitative)
"For payroll purposes" is exactly what I'm saying, it's shady and a warning flag about the company that would try to pull such tricks. Serious companies do not need to resort to these kinds of payroll manipulations. The ones that do it are probably skimping in all sorts of other ways and are not someone you want to work for. In most industries either have the payroll, work, confidence, and honesty to hire people as full employees or you're trying to get one past your workers. That's a recipe for disaster. It's one thing to have a specialist consultant come in and solve a thorny issue for you, it's another to substitute hiring people with this type of temporary and unstable position.
Happy you're enjoying Swift! :) I've done something similar recently and here's the approach I took in negotiating invites with Firebase: Create your Firebase reference: &gt; let ref = Database.database().reference() **User 1** - Create a new location in the database for TestGroup: &gt;ref.child("groups").child("TestGroup").setValue(true) - Add the invited user's ID to a list of all invitations. Each user will only look for their own ID in the list. Set the value to the group name. &gt;ref.child("invites").child("User2").setValue("TestGroup") **User 2** - Listen for their ID in the invitations list and save the group name as /users/User2/groups/TestGroup &gt; ref.child("invites").child("User2").observe(.value) { (snapshot) in *[insert line break here]* if snapshot.exists() { if let groupName = snapshot.value as? String { ref.child("users").child("User2").child("groups").child(groupName).setValue(true) } } } Now both User 1 and User 2 both know the name of the group is TestGroup, and all groups are found in /groups/*name*/ in the database, so they know where to read/write. As for the active group changing, you could do: &gt;ref.child("activeGroup").setValue("TestGroup") and have an observer for: &gt;ref.child("activeGroup") Then you can get the currently active group name and get its data from /groups/name/. Hope this makes some sense! Let me know if you have any questions. There's other ways you could do this and hopefully this sparks some ideas.
As posted above, can you please link to the google list that shows 'Yudiz' as the best app development company globally please.
My main concern about this is that OP won't be getting paid. I started a business many years ago, there's a huge need for companies that can't afford a full time employee, but need the work to be done. Not all companies have the ability to hire an expensive developer, yet they still have the need for something to be developed. In this case, the company had no business offering an internship then trying to convert. I'm thinking the OP should look elsewhere for a real internship or at least confront them.
I agree that both "intern" and "consultant" status are widely abused in the industry. On the other hand, using a 1099 to report student intern pay is not, by itself, a huge red flag. If this place has a cubicle farm full of consultant-interns, then that is clearly abuse. It their internships last more than a few months, if they hire interns instead of employees, if "serving" as an intern is a prerequisite to future employment at the firm -- these are red flags If it is a true student internship, a 1099 seems appropriate. A real internship is a sort of temporary vocational training undertaken for the benefit of the intern, without the expectation of future employment at the firm, and where the intern does not displace other employees. Students would have other sources of health insurance coverage. What would be the point in making them contribute to an employee health plan for a few months? 
Putting in the final touches of [BiggerPicture](https://biggerpicture.app), my little app for enlarging images using Core ML. I use mostly MVVM pattern to make it easy to support UI state preservation/restoration (that is, archive the ViewModel objects as an application state). However I found that Swift's `Codable` isn't too great for this use for two reasons: - Impedance mismatch with AppKit's `encodeRestorableState` functions that are based on `NSCoder`. - Codable doesn't support polymorphic types. That is, if I have a `[Foo]` array but really contains subclasses of `Foo`, I can't easily archive it using `Codable` and need to go back to manually archive the array via `NSCoding`. 
I think it’s somewhat encrypted but I can see the messages inside the database which means it’s not end-to-end encrypted.
Ah, yes. Good point.
Wow, really appreciate all the replies. A lot of super good info here. It seems as though a little backstory is in order on how this all came about. Basically I was contacted by this founder after posting on a conference job wall that I was seeking an IOS internship. They are a small startup, no funding, and the only meeting I had with the founder was informal. He mentioned that there would be no pay, but high potential for me to learn and gain experience. He said that there are a plethora of simple changes that they want to make, and that I could also potentially make changes/updates based on the direction I wanted to take my learning. I imagine this all sounds odd, but as a self-taught super entry level swift developer, getting my foot in the door, paid or not, is very appealing. We have since been messaging electronically about next steps, what they want to change/implement etc. While waiting for an NDA to sign, I received an email that they were "going to treat me as an independent contractor instead". Does this matter given that I'm not concerned about being paid? My only concern in this regard would be any legal backlash due to code I wrote. I'm meeting with the founder this evening and should have more info later, but want to go into the meeting with an idea of what I should and should not accept. Any additional insights?
When you are deleting Items from your collectionView you have to first delete them from the array that is storing the items. Not sure if this helps, but it would be my guess based on what you posted.
&gt; They are a small startup, no funding, and the only meeting I had with the founder was informal. He mentioned that there would be no pay This is a hard no. They are 100% exploiting you for free labor. If you're going to do this then work on your own app and be your own boss. This will have little chance of benefitting you in any way, not even as a resume builder. I guarantee that if you list this on your resume that other employers are going to know right away what this company is doing and they will write off your time there. People are pretty tight-knit in the software industry, they talk and they know about these kind of shady outfits. A bad reputation gets spread quickly and far. If you're going to do free work then at least donate it to a good, visible, open-source project that others can view the code and see your contributions. Your work there might even be used by others to make better open-source software and benefit a lot of people. Working free for a company like this will put your work into a closed-source nightmare that this company will sell at a profit, one you'll see nothing from. They're absolutely leaning on your newness to the industry and flattering you to try to manipulate you. Do not let them do this. And, yes, there could be lots of legal backlash if your work somehow breaks the law or causes injury. Suppose there's a client data leak and there's a huge lawsuit over it, as an independent contractor you can also be named in the lawsuit and you'll be fiscally responsible if there's a judgement against you. Even worse, if there's a criminal investigation you could also be held culpable. Of course these are worst-case scenarios but the point is that a real employee would be more protected from these legal concerns. Some reading for you: [Being an Independent Contractor vs. Employee](https://employment.findlaw.com/hiring-process/being-an-independent-contractor-vs-employee.html) [What’s the Difference Between an Independent Contractor and an Employee?](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/the-difference-between-an-independent-contractor-and-an-employee) [Employee or Independent Contractor?](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/177992)
I guess it depends on the platform your app will be running on. Without looking too far into it, I think it certainly is plausible to use the pre-fetch API, especially on iOS. You can’t really load 1,000 photos into RAM. If we take an average 15MP jpeg at 50% compression, you are looking at about 1GB’s worth of memory just for the photo data. Let alone other objects in memory etc. However handling an array with 1,000 strings and using the API’s to create/fetch when needed is a lot less intensive on the memory and make you a better citizen. Whack in an NSCache, some logic to handle loading/storing/clearing in that and you will be even better on the CPU. On macOS, it would make you a better memory citizen, but 1GB of RAM isn’t as much of an impact.
Thanks so much! I'm retrieving them from CoreData as filepaths stored as strings so I'm thinking that it isn't too much memory usage.
The speed difference from loading off the disc is probably very little. But it can also give you time to create the image at the dimensions on your collectionViewCell and be an even better memory citizen :)
Thanks for taking the time to respond. I am a big newbie still so i think my next concepts to really dive into are more advanced CoreData topics and best practices, mem management, and learning about threads and async things. so much to learn!
Basically everything that could might load a ton of data could be a candidate.
Does anyone else see a Medium link and reflexively downvote it? I mean, I'll then go on to check out the article and see if I should retract it but most times I come back and the downvote was deserved.
The code seems pretty solid. An interesting example, thanks for putting up a transcript too!
thanks :)
&gt; While waiting for an NDA to sign, I received an email that they were "going to treat me as an independent contractor instead". Does this matter given that I'm not concerned about being paid? This has happened because someone told the founder that he was opening himself up to a lawsuit by taking on someone and calling them an *intern* and then treating them as an *employee*. [The test of an internship can be complicated](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm) but the bottom line is supposed to be that it benefits the intern more than the company s/he is interning with. Now it's often the case that companies take on interns with a long view of it being a way to determine whether they would later be a good hire, so you get into some squishyness about benefit. But in those cases people are almost always part of a formal education system and connected with the employer via a formalized program. Your situation has none of that and someone pointed out that it would be more sensible to pay you than risk getting in legal trouble later. As far as a decision for you, I think if you were willing to do this for free then you should be willing to do it for pay. If you're concerned about legal liability - and I am unconvinced you should be - you can ask about being indemnified against liability to the extent that is possible. The bigger thing I think you should be mindful of is that you don't give away your talents for too little for too long. Junior developers get compensated less but that doesn't mean they don't have value and don't deserve to be paid market rate.
Man, IDK what's with the votes on this thread lol. I stand corrected, thanks for your links!
make an outlet for the textfield and set the delegate to self self.textfield.delegate = self
oh, I did create the outlets but didn't know that I have to set it as a delegate also. Thanks for helping
I guess everybody gets downvotes today, haha. No problem, enjoy!
Delegates man!
I think it's a great course with tons of great content, going back years. It's foundation building without any exact goals in mind. Can't think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from it, even well outside cs circles. 
It’s fairly standard to create a UIViewController extension in which to group your delegate methods. It keeps your code nice and clean. E.G. // MARK: - UITextFieldDelegate extension ViewController: UITextFieldDelegate { // delegate methods here }
Thanks! the problem has been solved
func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() for view in collectionOutletOfViews { view.cornerRadius = 5 } }
You should be more specific, you're asking in a Swift forum, so I guess we can assume your goal would be to develop in Swift. So most of Swift is for iOS, so we can assume you have a goal of developing for iOS using Swift. You mention other languages and I think they are all scripting. You haven't mentioned the specific goals. So, the course should be very helpful as a starting position moving from scripts to an OO language. I can see the benefit to that. However, I didn't see Swift mentioned under CS50 and you might have enough programming to get OO and Swift without it. Given that, I'd probably try a Swift specific course, which I don't think would be a part of any college, maybe Stanford offers one before the 193P, IDK. On the other hand, knowing what CS50 teaches is hardly a bad thing to know... We really need to know your specific goals here.
While I haven't taken the course myself, Its always good to understand programming theory. So when stuff breaks down while you code, you have an idea of what went wrong. Mostly memory management and error messages. Paying for learning resources though? Don't spend more than 50 bucks. Unless its a degree or official certification, its not worth anything more than the knowledge you gain.
Hey. My goal is to devote my time to learning swift, building IOS apps and at the end of the day transition careers. I’m ready to commit myself to it. I’ve been going through the “intro to app development” ebook by Apple and have been getting on with it fine. 
I got the forecast to return a json result. why do you have an extra "&amp;lon=(lon)&amp;appid=(apiKey)&amp;units=imperial").responseJSON)" at the end of the original request string? For one thing, if you look at the result in browser, you will see that the JSON structure is different in the forecast version than the current weather version. Open the result in chrome and you can see the difference. https://imgur.com/a/tqsMGil
Might be able to use for view in self.view.subviews{ ... }
I think it's a really good course. Most people will better off having taken it. If your self teaching, they will cover many ideas you likely hadn't connected yet. 
I'd say it would be worth it. I was kinda in a similar boat. I've been doing iOS since 09 and .net/client server before that. I wanted to be a full stack iOS developer. So my choice was Python or JS and some database like Mongo. I've so far studied 4 of them and seems like Node.js/MongoDB is a pretty good way to go. One of the problems is figuring out what languages/platforms to learn. I've been doing this for a long time, the best bet is to learn as many as you can that related to what you'll be doing. iOS is currently ObjC/Swift and Firebase/Realm/CoreData. They are asking for full stack (mongo/Node.js/Python/...) so these are all related. CS50 seems to be a good intro to languages, it's hard to go wrong with that.

But that is the issue I can not seem to find out how to get the weather from OpenWeatherMap for just the next 3 hour time span...
Check page 5 of the book. There's a download link there. https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=app-dev-swift-student-swift-4
Why downvote? Why was it deserved, in your opinion? 
The code was pretty clunky and really deserved more explanation. It was presented in a "Here's a bunch of code." manner with very little breakdown of what was being performed. Then there's gems like this: if newStatus == PHAuthorizationStatus.authorized { completion(true) } else { completion(false) } Why not just do that very simply like this: completion(newStatus == PHAuthorizationStatus.authorized) There were quite a few instances of this sort of clumsy programming which are simply bad practices and not a good teaching example. The topic is interesting but the execution was lacking. Overall, this type of article is fairly typical for what I see posted on Medium. Once in a while someone will post a genuine, interesting, well-written article there but overall I feel the site is a haven for posts that should not be held up as examples of good programming practices.
You can create a @IBInspectable extension for UIView. That way, you’ll be able to set cornerRadius or any other property from storyboard.
Unless the API has a way to get the very next closest 3 hour result, you'd have to do the calculations yourself. Somewhere along the lines of getting the current time, then rounding it to whichever is the closest 3 hour mark. There is a problem with the API if i remember correctly. The free tier plan doesn't have any options to get today's 3 hour results. The forecasts only start with tommorow's results and it starts counting a certain number of hours ahead of the current time. So its hard to program something consistent to grab certain 3 hour marks of the day based on the JSON's index position for that time frame. I also made a weather app with ReactJS using openweathermap API and I gave up at this point because, if i correctly recall, you can only get that data from the "paid" 16 day forecast. It lists "16 day forecast includes --&gt;daily weather&lt;--" for that API call, which the free 5 day forecast does not offer.
Hey, zerrule, just a quick heads-up: **tommorow** is actually spelled **tomorrow**. You can remember it by **one m, two rs**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Are you talking about Harvard’s CS50 with David J. Malan? That was my first REAL introduction to programming when I was about 16. I had learned what programming was with Visual Basic when I was 14, but CS50 taught me the underlying concepts and principals of basic programming. I loved it. It absolutely solidified my dream to become a computer programmer. I’m now a professional software engineer. If you are a newcomer to the world of programming, I think it would absolutely be beneficial. If you are experienced or a professional, I don’t think you’d really get a lot of value out of the lectures. You may get some value out of the homework projects just for practice with efficient algorithms and such. 
Thank you very much buddy! I suppose that download button was easy for me to gloss over since it was black and white like the rest of the page.
I was a little stuck on this same question when I started a few months back. The most important thing is just to start on any reputable course and see it through. Angela's course on Udemy is great, but it most certainly won't be the only thing you go through. Not because it isn't solid, but because you will need to learn things again from other perspectives. No one course has it all, and even if it did... you'd pick new things up by going through it several times... so might as well do that with multiple courses. Angela filled in some gaps for me, but I also appreciate some of the key things I only learned through other courses. Pick a good course: Angela on Udemy, Ray Wenderlich, TeamTreeHouse, [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com), or Hacking With Swift... and then just dive right into it. It's far more important to commit to any decent course to get some momentum going than to try and determine the "perfect" course. I got stuck a little too long trying to do that and regret it. Once you get some momentum going, you'll be glad you just went for it because it'll be easier to keep going at that point.
Apple has an exhausting documentation for Metal. Finding Pi is not a GPU task, because GPUs are meant for SIMD-suitable solutions.
1. Apple documentation/tutorials 2. Stanford's video lecture series on Youtube about iOS/Swift. (This opened my eyes to a lot of small things about Swift that my eyes glazed over while speedreading documentation.) 3. WWDC videos. 4. Udemy All valid sources of learning but I'd recommend them in that order. Don't anticipate the Stanford course will be especially difficult to follow. It's patient, brisk, clearly-explained and I got my first coding job based directly on things I learned from those lectures. Also there are a ton of iOS courses on Udemy nowadays (at least last I checked). Do not for the love of God purchase any course at the base $300-400 price. Udemy rotates all their courses through "sales" that guarantee just about everything will be around $15 within a few months, so I always mark courses I want to take well in advance and avoid the more glitzy "BUILD A GAME IN A DAY" types. You probably already knew all this but if not I just saved you some $. :) 
I found myself able to dive straight into Swift programming coming from Javascript and after Angela's Udemy course. I did have to go back and look up some concepts though from Apple's Swift docs once i wanted to get some custom things done.
For some reason I didn't think of that but this seems to be the best way to accomplish that. Thank you!
I highly recommend taking a look at Apple’s App development with swift book. It’s free on iBooks and is very good. 
Please read the swift book by apple as many times as possibles once the basics are strong rest will be quite easy.Also keep practicing swift example problems rather than iOS stuff. iOS Will fall in place automatically.
Yeah this order for me. I initially started Udemy but quickly started wth apple material first. I can see already that it’s filling holes that I didn’t understand in Udemy bootcamp. 
How you finding it? I have some JS experience too? I’m really loving swift! It seems a lot more strict n concise than JavaScript. 
I'm finding a few things that are possibly relevant: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36741976/this-application-is-modifying-the-autolayout-engine-from-a-background-thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41203205/what-is-nsisengine It looks like you've somehow gotten your auto layout constraints into a bad state and when the engine checks its assertions it fails. Are you doing any of this code from a background thread?
NSAttributedStringKey.font 
So is there any other Weather API's that you know of that are good and reliable and can do what I am asking for?
Yooo I’d recommend formatting that code 
i highly recommend let's build that app youtube channel
The code should now be better formatted and I added in some more of it as well. Thank you.
thank you :) been wanting to learn generics I'm going to dive into this :) edit: also watched your "Dynamic gestures with UIKit Dynamics" video, great stuff :)
I’m working on learning swift and developing a chat app for the heck of it to, well, learn. Also since JSQ Message was deprecated, is there a good alternative?
[MessageKit](https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit) I think?
Not an expert by any measure here but if `directory` can be nil you should declare it as an Optional. If it’s String it’s either a string or the app crashes, I believe. Edit: I’m also not sure where you need to check for nil in that code. Are you talking about `for directory in imageDirectories`? If that’s it, `directory` will never be nil, so no need to check. Someone correct me if I’m wrong. 
Interesting. My app is crashing due to a nil value and I thought it was `directory` within the for loop. I guess I will need to make a new thread. 
Are you sure? What does the debugger say exactly?
I made a new thread/OP. I'm getting "Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping."
Then your problem may be here: `let imageDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!` since that’s where you’re unwrapping something. Try optional binding instead. 
I tried to compile the project but I can’t since the storyboard files are missing, so I’ll refer to what I said in the other thread. It’s somewhere where you’re force unwrapping something. 
You should start looking closer to the context of that error, not in the code you pasted above.
I'm printing out imageDirectory and images -- I seem to be getting the correct paths: file:///Users/amit/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06F45BD2-A619-4C1C-9818-C51829CE62CB/data/Containers/Data/Application/88E466F6-B097-4BC4-82EB-2B39FF1DDD25/Documents/Amit/ Optional(&lt;UIImage: 0x60c0000a8e20&gt;, {947, 947}) file:///Users/amit/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06F45BD2-A619-4C1C-9818-C51829CE62CB/data/Containers/Data/Application/88E466F6-B097-4BC4-82EB-2B39FF1DDD25/Documents/Kuni/ Optional(&lt;UIImage: 0x60c0000a8fa0&gt;, {947, 947}) file:///Users/amit/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06F45BD2-A619-4C1C-9818-C51829CE62CB/data/Containers/Data/Application/88E466F6-B097-4BC4-82EB-2B39FF1DDD25/Documents/Sayaka/ Optional(&lt;UIImage: 0x60c0000a9120&gt;, {947, 947}) file:///Users/amit/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06F45BD2-A619-4C1C-9818-C51829CE62CB/data/Containers/Data/Application/88E466F6-B097-4BC4-82EB-2B39FF1DDD25/Documents/Suni/ Optional(&lt;UIImage: 0x60c0000a92a0&gt;, {947, 947}) 
You are doing far too much force unwrapping and try! In this code snippet alone. Use more guard statements and if let blocks and you won’t run into this sort of stuff. It’s probably somewhere that you’re referring to ‘.first!’ in an empty array or something along those lines.
Also, use the do-try-catch syntax where you can instead of try! Unless you want the try line to 100% crash on failure. Even then you’re often better logging an error message and fatalError or something.
Hi.I'm not quite sure what you mean. I had this code working on an earlier build, but now not sure where the problem is.
FolderLabel.isUserInteractionEnabled = true is trying to call as static method on the FolderLabel class itself. But isUserInteractionEnabled is a property of an instance of type FolderLabel. Most likely you have created an instance of FolderLabel (maybe something like `let folderLabel = FolderLabel()`), and are mistakenly using a capital letter at the start of the variable name here, and thus calling a non-existent static method. Go back to your FolderLabel instance initialization (to make sure it exists). Then use its name in place of the capitalized "FolderLabel" that you are trying to set isUserInteractionEnabled on. edit: oh hey, since you provided a Drive link to your code, allow me to recommend using source control such as Github instead.
Hi. FolderLabel is actually a UILabel, which I declared within the same class (UITableViewCell). 
nah I took a look at your FirstTableViewCell, and you have: ` @IBOutlet weak var ImageView: UIImageView! ` ` @IBOutlet weak var FolderLabel: UILabel!` You declare properties but this doesn't initialize them yet. They are both null when you later try to set values on them. Also you should not start your instance variables with capital letters. That is how you reference Types edit: I'm assuming you are building all this in code. You're not using a custom nib for the cell are you?
It's really an issue of what you already know. I haven't done Apple's course since Swift 1.0. The Udemy course that I bought all had non-Apple stuff in it like Realm. So knowing Swift at the start helps. Don't forget to double check the Swift version when you get the Udemy courses and also they do have some crappy courses out there. Some are damn hard to hear. I personally didn't think that the Udemy course were great for starting out in Swift.
Hi, I initialize the values using function `setCell` which I call from class `FirstTableViewController` This is the function where `setCell` is called: func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell { let folderCell = dataCells[indexPath.row] let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "FirstTableCell") as! FirstTableViewCell cell.setCell(cell:folderCell) cell.delegate = self return cell } 
Thank you. Yeah, I will start incorporating these statements. Though, I'm using print statements often to check the values, and I don't see any nil values. 
no, that method is still trying to call methods on null pointer references. This is setCell(): func setCell (cell : FolderCell){ self.ImageView.image = cell.image self.FolderLabel.text = cell.label } this does not create the instances, it just tries to tell the ImageView/UILabel properties of this cell to do things. Those instances do not exist unless they are being loaded from a custom nib or they have been initialized (ex: `self.imageView = UIImageView()` also if you aren't creating those views pre-compilation in a nib, I don't believe those properties need to be @IBOutlets edit: also (not related to the original bug) you are using the term "Cell" to mean both " a UIVIew based object which contains an imageView and Label" *and* "the data used to populate the aforementioned cell". I would strongly advise against this as a general policy. One option might be to use the name FirstTableViewCell for the actual rendered view and FolderCellData for the class which you currently call FolderCell.
Is this the proper way to use guard statements: guard let documentDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first?.path else { print("NO DOCUMENT DIRECTORY") return []
Alright. Let me digest everything. I've mainly been following tutorials on Custom TableViews,: such as `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtO5QT2D_H8` and trying to follow the customary ways to create tableViews. I actually had it working earlier, but as my code got a little more complicated, something wet awry. 
think about it this way: there are two steps to setting properties of that imageView. First you need to declare it a property of the cell, which you have done (though you need to lowercase the capitalized first letter on that instance name). `@IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!` now the property `imageView` of this cell can be referenced from anywhere in scope, but all you've done is state to the rest of your code "trust me, when you need this particular UIImageView, you should look to this property here." The code doesn't know if the object that this property refers to exists yet (and in your case it does not exist yet). The solution is just to initialize the UIImageView and UILabel with: folderLabel = UILabel() imageView = UIImageView() contentView.addSubview(folderLabel) contentView.addSubview(imageView) somewhere early in the Cell's lifecycle so that when the Cell's are recycled automatically by the tableView, you don't have to remove the old and add the new views every time. Also I see that you are hinging this cell on code contained within `awakeFromNib`. Unless you are using a custom nib for this cell (which I don't see in your project directory), this function is probably not being called at all. I would throw a breakpoint in there to make sure it's even taking place. edit: and of course after adding those views you'll need to position them (you won't need to size them because both types have IntrinsicContentSize and will size themselves)
Quick question: it seems you are initializing the classes programmatically, but I was using the StoryBoard to create a UILabel, and UIImageView. On my StoryBoard here is how everything looks: https://imgur.com/a/9bAUYko I then used ctrl + right click (?) to connect the gui with swift code. 
I think there is a trick to get the Storyboard files to display properly. I need to ask my friend, who also initially had a similar problem and then got it to display properly. 
Please put your code under source control and send the link to that. Not google drive. That will make it easier to pull down and run to see what is wrong. 
it looks like your .storyboard files were replaced with .storyboard.xml files in your directory somehow. Remove the .xml at the end of both and they load again in Xcode. Also the connections between those two controls are somehow missing from the @IBOutlet property declarations. Add those again (the ctrl + click + drag you did before), and it builds without the crash. I also had to clear the value for `Main Interface` in the Project settings, and replace `Main` with `Main.storyboard`
Okay. Let me just figure out the steps via Xcode. 
It was surprisingly simple from Xcode. Updated OP. Thank you. 
Yes, though I’d advise against returning an empty array unless that’s a completely valid and expected scenario. If returning an empty array indicates an error, you should throw an exception.
learning Swift is easy. It steals good things from a bunch of other familiar languages, and its syntax is not very unlike JavaScript with the inclusion of strong typing and optionals. Learning to use Swift in iOS to make meaningful software is a lengthier task because there are so many layers to Cocoa. I wouldn't recommend starting with Javascript based frameworks like React Native or Vue, because while they're very advanced nowadays they intentionally abstract over the implementation of most basic things by creating their own post-compile native code, assuming that when you do need to tweak something in Obj-C, you'll know enough Swift, Obj-C *and* the Javascript framework to get over a hurdle.
So you don't get the Fatal error anymore? I will check out the connections. When you say Project settings do you mean, File -&gt; Project settings? Unless you are talking about the left-most pane, when in my case I already have Main.Storyboard" https://imgur.com/Ymhc2Qt 
iOS is fun AF. I learned old school pre-ARC objC iOS sometime after I learned jQuery. I’ve kept up to date on Node, VueJS, Express, etc. I also diddle with Vapor as a server-side swift tinker project. iOS has never been more accessible than ever thanks to swift. Your real pain point is going to be learning Xcode. (And Xcode is more accessible than ever, as well.) I recommend learning “vanilla” iOS dev. Don’t bother with Nativescript or ReactNative. Areas that will be learning curves: 1. Binding UI to code with interface builder. It’s easy, unless something goes wrong. And then you’ll be making a trip to stack overflow. 2. Concurrency / threads. JavaScript doesn’t really have this pattern. iOS does. You may not hit topic straight away. 3. Any hardware stuff you might be doing with cameras, 3D, Bluetooth, WiFi, AR, Face recognition, motion, audio. It’s just stuff that most web devs don’t do because browser support is lacking or inconsistent. Let us know how thing go on your new adventure. L
The label that you are referencing on that line has no outlet from the storyboard. It may have been removed in the past and not re-added. Youll need to reconnect that label and the Image view in `FirstTableViewCell.swift` https://imgur.com/a/lZIjYNE For more context, `@IBOutlet weak var FolderLabel: UILabel!` is the label declaration, it ends with `!` which means you're telling xcode that you guarantee that it will be there when you use it. When you access it to turn off the interaction its not there since its not created from the storyboard anymore. Thus you get a crash. saying that the optional was not there when it was used. `!` is an implicitly unwrapped optional. Also as an aside, variable names are typically lowercased for their first letter and camel cased after that. So `FolderLabel` should be `folderLabel`. The structure you're using is for Classes and other Types. `class FolderLabel` would be correct formatting for that. 
Yeah those .Storyboard references are still listed but they're corrupted somehow (for me they won't even open in XCode). Since XCode can't open them, it can't set the properties to reference the views in the storyboard. This is all you need to do: 1. inside the actual file directory (not the XCode sidebar), inside the Base.jproj folder, rename both Storyboards to remove the '.xml' at the end. They will both end with the .storyboard extension as it shows in Xcode. 2. Right click on both of Storyboards in Xcode and tap Open As -&gt; Interface Builder - Storyboard. 3. make the ctrl-click-drag connections from the UIImageView and UILabel inside your custom cell to the property definitions in the Cell class. 4. Build and it should take you to this https://imgur.com/a/ZkIvWJm

i think you can manually run the playground so itms not running every second. Cant remember how, but there’s a blue icon somewhere to turn it on/off
In terms of languages, Swift is much more powerful and enjoyable than Javascript (even better than Typescript). In terms of the GUI API, it's just different, but programming to the iOS GUI API doesn't feel too different from programming against the browser's DOM API. Though, if you've never directly programmed against the browser's DOM, it might feel alien. 
Do you have a mechanical hard drive in there or is it an ssd? Xcode hates slow storage. 
It sounds like you're describing a protocol. protocol ApiInterface { } class ApiImplementation1: ApiInterface { } class ApiImplementation2: ApiInterface { }
Gonna sound stupid, how do I check that?
Learnt and made my first Mac App! It's a dead simple app to add page numbers to your PDF files. https://pdfpagenumber.com , or Mac App Store link if you prefer : https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/numberer/id1407001685?mt=12 
Try setting the playground to run manually instead of automatically (by default the playground will auto run after every keystroke, making it slow af). You can set it like this: https://imgur.com/a/BDvp6tX
Be prepared to develop much much slower. Swift is super type safe and iOS is fairly opinionated. I would recommend researching the simplest things, even if you have enough syntax knowledge to get to point B. In general, try to learn the norms and styles of sound iOS code. That would be more beneficial if you’re actually trying to learn, as opposed to just quickly getting an app MVP out there. 
its fixed itself while still in auto mode so I haven't been able to see if this is helping or not, but I'm gonna keep it in that mode from here on in, cuz that makes sense
Yeah its a lot more structured. I find myself working with Apple's frameworks all the time now. You can't do anything without understanding how it will integrate with the iOS ecosystem. Early on, I tried making a scrolling images feature with UIScrollView using pictures from the custom camera and the app crashed because of memory issues. The vanilla ScrollView didnt reuse cells like the collectionView and tableView does.
I think most of them try to get you on a paid plan somehow. There could be other free ones, just google "weather API". I remember one that was an option but i went to their site and they've closed it for free keys. So yeah, can't help you with that.
In some ways it can be a bit harder, and there can certainly be more roadblocks like the type system and build tools, but in general I find the biggest challenge web developers face is unlearning what they already know and just accepting that things are different.
As someone who’s been building native apps since 2012 and who now has to learn web technologies to inherit a hybrid app codebase, I’d say do it. Even if there’s a learning curve, there’s a lot to like about Apple’s coherence in its developer tools and object orientation in code. Web front-end work and the lack of coherence in it just make me want to shoot myself in the head.
I'm not sure that's the issue. I removed all constraints in that View Controller, except for the cell (that's loaded from the xib file), no change. I'm still getting the same error.
Based on your technical aptitude, I’m gonna assume you’ve not opened it up. Apple Menu -&gt; About this Mac. What is it? We can assume based on the age of the computer, what it has in it. 
I had almost the same question a year ago and decided to learn Swift. Did the whole Stanford Engineering CS193p course and read the neccesary reading tasks also that they have. It took quite some time, and I still have to look some things and constructs up as I write code but overall it was just the right way to do it. Swift is in my opinion the nicest language ever, if you disregard the whole Optionals part (sometimes it’s just too much code to do very simple things), but that’s just my opinion. Be sure to look up and follow a certain architectural patternwhen you start with Swift (MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc), otherwise the code can get really messy.
Overall iOS is much simpler, simply because it's a closed system. Web development is very, very fractured and there's 1000 different ways and frameworks to do things. With iOS, the vast majority of people use the same tools which makes things much more streamlined. There are a lot fewer decisions you have to make as a developer, because Apple has already made them for you.
Can you share some screenshots of storyboard, simulator and device?
I thought JavaScript was weakly typed?
it is. I meant to say “it’s not unlike Javascript, *except* with the inclusion of strongly typed..”
I recommend learning “vanilla” iOS dev. Don’t bother with Nativescript or ReactNative. Why is that though? I’m starting iOS too but I’m still confused as to why React Native or even Xamarin are not better options? You can use some of the same code for both iOS and android. Isn’t that better?
React native will kill react native before Apple does. All the big companies are abandoning it as it proves to not scale well at all.
Much harder as not knowing the difference between compared and compare. 
&gt; iOS is fun AF. It sucks ass. Apple's docs suck. Xcode is a hate hate relationship. I don't know what you have been smoking, but fun? That's not the word. I've been doing this for 8 years.
Do you have anything backing your feelings? I have a hard time seeing this, although I'd welcome it. And, if they were to kill react native, what would you say about Xamarin and other cross platform solutions?
To be honest, if you hate that this much, why don’t you just switch to web/android etc? I switched to iOS+Swift from web+java and that was an upgrade for me. Xcode, compared to ides for other platforms (android studio, visual studio, etc) is not that efficient, especially when code completion/refactor fails, but have some pros over them also.
&gt; Inplying you want to support Android
Also, I don't like the way the apps work. The Airbnb app doesn't feel native, in my opinion. And that should be a high quality app using React Native. So in addition to not scaling well, it also doesn't look, feel and perform like a native app.
The react native libraries are obj-c and obj-c++. Apple would have to ban JavaScript processing via JavaScriptCore if they wanted to kill off RN. And good luck getting Apple to ban the ability to interpret JavaScript in apps. 
It would be better if they were sustainable over years. Xamarin hides too much complexity and device specific benefits. React Native has a dependency chain that is insanely large and unwieldy. Both of these make it hard to maintain large projects over time.
What are your thoughts on using storyboard vs just simply hard coding ? 
Gotcha!
An example of a project I recently worked on. I used ionic to do a simple gps tracking system but the precision wasn’t the best. Switched to native iOS and it was 10x better doing the exact same thing.
Totally agree. For web I use Angular and NestJS, both typescript. Recently got into Swift and realized how much more powerful it is, and enjoyable.
I think both have their place. My background is actually design (my degree is BFA!), so IB doesn’t bother me. Coding UI by hand becomes more appealing the higher the payoff: lots of onditional formatting, swapping UI controls, areas of very high reuse patterns.
I’m not a hater. If you love React native then please enjoy your code. I think staring native helps build a stronger foundation at a lower learning curve. Also, new SDK features will always assume “vanilla” patterns. Also, I think the dev community is, for better or worse, optimized around vanilla a bit more than React native or others.
Here’s an upvote. It’s easy to be smug about your comment — “this food is terrible! And there’s not enough of it.” But the reality is I think we all have had at least some days (or weeks, years) where Apple being Apple or Xcode being Xcode or Swift being too immature or ObjC being too clever or the SDK being a labyrinth. iOS development is not all roses. Apple is faaaaar from perfect. Especially about dev relations and dev tooling. It’s important that we iOS dev community stick up for ourselves and not “shoot our wounded”. I get that you’re suffering right now. I hope things improve. I totally recommend you hang out at your local iOS dev Meetup some and talk through your problems And I know it gets better. Stick with it!
I don’t think learning React Native or such is a bad thing, but I think you should try to nail down each platform’s native SDK first. Learning the concepts of each framework, such as Android’s and iOS’ Activity Lifecycles are going to be important to know whether you’re using React Native, or writing for each platform separately. 
Finally great to see someone from a design background here!
Well I did Google some stuff but I can’t seem to find one with a simple, up to date and can give data on the weather later on that same day for free. 
As the playlist name suggests, it’s video series for Beginners. You’ll learn only the basics. To learn advanced swift, I recommend www.hackingwithswift.com
Do you enjoy spending your time asking useless questions on Reddit or are you just karma farming? Bet you are from India too
There must be something wrong in your path. Your path determines where the IDE is going to look for libraries. I’ve had this happen to me before. Unfortunately this is usually when I ask someone to fix my path for me. I’m also even more clueless as to what the windows commands would be.
Oh those docs are beautiful compared to the Cocoa docs...
Well, in 1983, when I was nine, my mother decided computers were probably going to be a big deal and bought a Commodore 64. I started programming shortly after - crude text adventures, title screens for games I couldn't write, sound effects (yes, you had to program them) and other general mucking about. I did the usual courses in high school and then afterwards but got disillusioned when I realised the time when I could write professional software and/or games by myself had passed. The iPhone gave that back to us. I started again in 2010 and my apps can now pay the bills - but only just. Fortunately, I have a casual job as well and my wife works so we end up with a comfortable amount after the bills are done with. 
The ITunes U iOS 11 course from Stanford is a great place to start getting your head around the iOS platform in general. It’s geared toward both new developers and established Devs. It’s a great jumping off point. I’m a senior dev and still watch the videos because there’s always some small thing I pick up during each of the courses. Other than that, just start building your app and let stackoverflow help with questions you have. You can always ask questions here too. This seems to be a good community and there’s a lot of people willing to help. Just be willing to help yourself and others will jump in. Also feel free to ping people directly if they’ve agreed. Most professional devs actually like helping other people learn and build cool things. 
So what do you suggest then, Mr. Positive?
20 videos? Not even remotely close.
At university I was one of a couple students using a Mac in computer science. Most were using Windows and another couple were on Linux. We had a lot of time allocated for learning languages and platforms that we were interested in apart from what we were learning in our courses which were more general. I decided to learn Objective-C and build programs for OS X. It was very difficult at first for many reasons but in my second year or so I took a course in development for Android. It was very basic and pretty useless but that's when I figured out that I wanted to combine what I knew from OS X development with what I learned from Android development and start building iOS apps. I had an iPhone since the get go so it was just a matter of opening up a project and learn by doing. In my third and final year I decided to start looking for full time jobs to be prepared for the fall. One thing let to another and suddently I had signed a contract for an iOS developer role at a newspaper company. I had an exam to go as well as the scientific paper to get my degree. After the final exam I went home and the next morning I went to work for the first time. I was writing the paper with my best friend (today an Android developer at the same company) and he was able to shoulder most of the conclusion of the paper. I love him for many reasons and this is one of them. I'm really sorry to have made such rash decisions but it turned out great in the end. I did of course help but it's one of those things I regret in life. Shitty feels aside, at my then new job I was working with four iOS consultants. I made it my mission to learn as much as possible by picking their brains and one in particular taught me more in the first few months than three years at university did. I got to be a part of the digitalization of the second largest newpaper in my country and it was really exciting. During the time I was there we went from a simple web wrapper to a template population technique we stole from The Guardian and finally to a fully native experience. It taught me so much about iOS, agile methodologies, testing and programming in general. It was also extremely fun. After two and a half years there I quit my job and started a company. I've been consulting for about a year and I want to do this for as long as I can. Not sure when I started doing Swift. :-)
It’s a refreshing breeze. Seriously. Like CSS, auto layout can be shitty at the beginning, but then, it’s easy once you get the hang of it. It’s very cool to have everything made by one company, and the fact that you don’t have to teach the browser everything from the beginning, plus it’s an application and not a document, so navigation and modal dialogs are easier to do in my opinion. If you want to have JavaScript code, which is a good idea if you have to make an Android or Windows version, you can load your JS to a virtual machine (think of an invisible web page that only has JS) and interface with that VM. Cool thing compared to web development is that you don’t lose the virtual machine with a page change. Remember that it’s Apple, the same engine that runs JS in Safari is running JS in iOS. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore/jsvirtualmachine This is the equivalent of a browser. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore/jscontext This is the equivalent of a page in the browser. Now the bad thing. Swift is compiled, and even though it has a REPL that makes it look like a intérpretes language, it’s still compiled, so you can’t program line by line in a console/node like you can with JS. Also the same thing for AutoLayout vs designing CSS on the browser.
The only way for Apple to kill react native would be creating an real alternative to it.
You really have to make your question more clear. What sort of problem are you trying to solve here? You don't want the `SortType` enum exposed at all? How would you create `get(sort:)` without it?
Figured out what was wrong, had auto run on, changed it to manual and it runs great meow. Thank you though!
I don’t know but the amount of work Apple are putting in to making Swift accessible for all is pretty impressive... makes me wonder why and what the future holds for the language. IMHO react native will die by itself. These things come and go with JavaScript. 
I have the same opinion What I don’t like is, with RN the complexity of code maintenance keeps increasing as the app grow. 
Alternative cannot be possible as Apple don’t want to support cross platform development 
You can't just read some promises on a website and conclude its better. Go try to use them in an actual app which runs on both platforms and get back to us. And have native dev experience to compare it to.
Xamarin is really nice for enterprise apps. Fast but boring and repetitive apps with lots of business rules.
Then they won’t kill. IMHO, Apple is only dumb to not support cross app development.
The enum does not have a constructor so you can’t change its access modifier
If you hate iOS the answer is not to switch to Android. I am an Android developer. We have a lot of the same problems (IDE can be terrible) and more (support bajillion devices with their own weird version of the OS instead of 10 devices with the same version)
The issue is the `first!` call. That's a force-unwrapping, which will crash if the collection is empty.
Ray weinderlich has made an AMAZING book. In it you make many apps from scratch, and it explains everything really well. It's quite expensive, so I won't post it here, but if you want a pdf or epub including all included files, don't hesitate to dm me :) Learned everything I know from it.
I assume you're referring to Xamarin Forms? From what I've understood about Xamarin "native" you still need to "duplicate" the UI code for each of the platforms? And, know each of the platform frameworks. What I'm getting at is that you don't really save as much time as "advertised".
Alright cool, I guess I will start learning swift now instead of nativescript or react-native.
From what perspective are they dumb? We have an iOS only application at work which drives a fair bit of sale for iOS devices, i.e. Apple making more money. I'd say it's in their best interest to not support cross platform development. However, it'd be nice to be able to easily port an app to another platform.
Sound like it! Swift just get job done just like their other eco-system. Since I own macbook pro for a year, I feel like I get tons of job done which I can't say the same when using windows.
Thank you so much! It seems the IBOutlet's weren't properly connected to StoryBoard. I didn't have to perform step 2. It's strange that the IBOutlet connections weren't connected to StoryBoard as that's the first thing I remember doing. I will keep in mind to always check the connections.
Thank you , got it working! So: Classes, Protocols, : FolderLabel vars, constants, functions: folderLabel
Thank you. It seems I need to create my own "exceptions" and "errors" using enum? Is that the way to go? 
Apple is going to make a shit tone of money selling your company’s devices. Now if another company makes an Android only App, it’s Apple that loses.
If you have an iPad of a recent generation, you could start by downloading the Swift Playgrounds application at this Apple’s address : https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/ This will allow you to learn the Swift programming language step by step with electronic books and interactives playgrounds. I hope I have helped you. (I apologize for my English. I am Swiss 🇨🇭)
Yes, of course. However, Apple do "promote" user lock-in to their environment. And, in that spirit they'd never support cross platform development.
You took us through one hell of a ride there 
So it depends what you do. If you're able to manage most of it with Forms you're good. If you manage to do a lot with Native because you have a limited amount of often repeated controls you're also good. C# is a lot better for business logic than Java or JavaScript. Great IDE (on Windows). But usually boring projects, so I didn't continue in that direction. Which is a pity because Microsoft really has the greatest tools and frameworks out there.
Well, 10 years ago I went to the WWDC as an Apple System engineer with over 15 years experience in maintaining clients and servers in the Apple eco system. Saw the potential of iOS, or as it was known then as iPhone development, started in learning C on the Mac, followed by a Big Nerd Ranch course in 2010: Beginning iPhone Development. Started over as a junior developer learning a lot of development, first in Objective-C and since a year just in Swift. In the last years worked on several big projects for big banks and insurance companies. And a couple of health related app/sdk development for a major player in that industry. Learning every day, always been interested in learning and improving myself. Not just on a technical skill level, but also on a more personal level. Since a couple of months I now work for an enterprise reseller, combining my skill as a developer with the skills as an Apple Consultant.
Thanks for the reply, sure! Look at this, I just started to make a new app where I just added two labels and this happens: [https://imgur.com/a/V6OVnAU](https://imgur.com/a/V6OVnAU) as you can clearly see, the top label is to the left of the screen in the main storyboard If I use the iPhone 8 simulator then it looks same as in my storyboard [https://imgur.com/a/2yOic0g](https://imgur.com/a/2yOic0g) But then if I side load the app to my iPhone 8 it shows everything to the right of the screen [https://imgur.com/GlPLzuR](https://imgur.com/GlPLzuR) And this is without constraints, when I apply them the objects just disappear

Yup! That’s exactly the way to do it :)
You could add the line to the view of the cell itself. That line could be just a CALayer so you can modify anything you want.
Sadly, every tutorial seems to show you how to hook up to public APIs but don't show you how to hook up to your own. I assume you're writing the API yourself. They show you how to connect in a web page, but not in iOS. I've been building the backend part but they stop the tutorial when the get to the iOS stuff. One from Udemy even said they'd get back to it and never did. I've got a bunch of books and tutorials I keep working thru waiting for one of these to answer these question. If you can use Realm or Firebase, there's a lot of tutorials on that.
I thought this would be an attempt at a shittymorph comment reading the first few words.
Your English is fine. :) "I hope I have helped you" could also be "I hope this helps", "I hope this helped you out", "I hope I have helped you out". English is like Perl: Way too many ways to do the same thing. I do hope that the alternate phrases help you, because I've seen over the years non-native speakers stick to their languages syntax and grammar that is a little "off" for a native speaker. Really the same problem as learning C/C++, and then trying to pick up some of the newer stuff in Java/C#/Swift. You don't have to do it the "old way", but it's hard.
Hacking with swift 
Yeah, but i think they will “kill” it by keep improving swift. Baning it would not be a smart move.
The tick marks will just be telling the application to change font at that point. Seeing as you are writing the app, it would be down to you to parse the text and determine which bits need a different font. I think you’d be able to have different fonts in the same AttributedString. 
Check this out: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos
&gt;https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos thank you will check that out!
I had to slog on by downloading as much sample projects from the Apple developer/documentation site as I could, and then tinkering with them to understand how every feature worked. A lot of things are poorly documented or not updated for Swift (like Pasteboard/Clipboard/Drag and Drop stuff, though it may have improved since I last worked with it; currently focusing on iOS though I love the macOS platform, so many good features that come out-of-the-box with it that just beg to be used in your apps.) 
You are not going to get any answers with a broad question like that. How are we supposed to help you without any context like what kind of backend are you using for your API?
Hey, I saw this and wrote up something based on my own research and testing in a Swift project I made a little while ago. Let me know if this makes sense and works, as I modified some stuff to make it more general without testing it (specifically the error testing). It's written in pure Swift (3 I think?): https://gist.github.com/noahbkim/c090e39ba55bdf99135e05fc91009c60
Yes; all business expenses which can be very significant. I had my eyes opened to this attending a small business seminar which is why it is often suggested that if you want to earn X dollars an hour you need to actually earn at least 2X that number. Even 2X can be low if you are in a high tax state and have significant liability issues. I can't stress this enough once you become a contractor you are effectively in business for yourself, so anybody reading this that might end up in such a situation should carefully evaluate their exposure and the protections needed. Ideally with a good lawyer that understand business law. I also can't stress enough that the approach this company is taking is exposing this new programmer to a huge amount of danger. No one wants to end up holding the bag because some bad actors rigged the situation in such a way that they didn't have responsibility.
I use [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) API, you get 1000 free api calls a day and each additional call is $0.0001. I also use [ForecastIO](https://github.com/sxg/ForecastIO) cocoapod to easily download and parse the JSON. It’s probably the easiest and cheapest I’ve found
I think the only way they start blocking React Native is if someone abuses it in some way. Live reloading new code to do things Apple doesn't allow, opens some sort of security vector, something like that. Aside from that, it's unlikely, but always a risk for those sorts of frameworks.
Does your file name have quotes in it? That would be my guess based on the error at the bottom. 
Not sure if this is a clever ad or not Hmmmmmmm
Wow that’s super weird. Is the text alignment set to center? Can you share your project so that I can try running it on my device.?
Second Dark Sky, and if you build a good model you can parse the API’s JSON result right into your struct with Swift’s built in JSON coder/decoder functions. Once I put the model together properly it’s just one line of code to parse the JSON into a Forecast object in my app. 
Username checks out. Seems like a bug worth filing.
I know a few but idk if they are compatible with Swift /s
How about MongoDb with Node.js?
Thanks for this thread. I too and looking to do iOS engineering going forward. I’m primarily a JavaScript css html person.
Try to look at the identity inspector
I think they’re looking for an Answer like “JSON over REST” or “SOAP”, i.e. what type of web service is it?
I'm wondering this too!
There’s quite a lot that’s the same, Foundation, GCD, etc... the main differences you hit right off are around the UI. AppKit takes some getting used to. Still, some similarities with UIKit for some controls. If you know iOS development, just jump in, work through the initial awkwardness with lots of googling and you’ll pick it up fast.
[This objc.io issue](https://www.objc.io/issues/14-mac/appkit-for-uikit-developers/) is also a good resource though is more targeted at people already familiar with iOS.
I found [Open source Mac apps](https://github.com/serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps) to be pretty useful. Resources for macos development are quite lacking, but I've found some books that might be useful. - [Programming Swift Mac Apps by Appsmith](http://www.appsmith.dk/?p=656) - [Mastering macOS](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-macos-programming) - [Hacking with macOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos) Packt books are generally hit and miss, but I quite like Mastering macOS. Hacking with macOS is amazing, and /u/twostraws worked really hard on it, and it shows. Can't say anything about the first book as I haven't read it yet. 
In that case, JSON over REST. Most every tutorial I've seen has JSON over REST. Here's one of the videos from the series [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) I'm almost finished with this [https://codewithmosh.teachable.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course/](https://codewithmosh.teachable.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course/) But he doesn't do any connections with iOS.
Wouldn’t spend much time learning the Cocoa APIs, as they’ll be bringing the iOS APIs to Mac next year. https://www.imore.com/marzipan
I really enjoyed writing Hacking with macOS – the platform is so powerful!
Did you run it in Instruments? It will tell you pretty much everything you need to know. A "leak" is not the same thing as memory consumption. If memory is released and not inaccessible, then there's no leak.
This is cool! I just started learning how to code and decided to go the Swift route (not sure if that’s recommended ) but I am going to use your site as another reference. The app is sweet . I would def use that.
According to what OP is saying it looks like a leak. The number of variables he has declared during the execution of that code is always the same and the size of them is also pretty stable. If he is seeing the memory usage going through the roof then it must be a leak: memory that should have been released still being used.
You need to use autoreleasepool here. 
Except when it can‘t be released because the system is working to capacity due to the loop. It will clean up the memory after it has finished though. 
It isn't really a memory leak, but it kind of looks like one. Also, the fix might seem a little like black magic. Memory management in Foundation uses `autorelease` from time to time. This used to be quite common. What `autorelease` basically means is "release this memory later". This is does in the next runloop cycle; basically, when all your methods have finished. `replacingOccurences` allocates a string somewhere in it's code, and autoreleases it. It is never actually released within your loop, because it'll happen "later" (after you're done with all your stuff). If you had this code in an iOS app, for example, it would deallocate all that memory when the loop and all of your code is done running. But then again, your iOS app would probably also crash on the device, because it ran out of memory. So, fortunately, there is a way to trigger releasing of autoreleased memory: `autoreleasepool { someCode }`. The `autoreleasepool` function will run `someCode `, then collect all memory that was autoreleased in your code (In your case, it's `replacingOccurrences` that does the autoreleasing). So, to "fix" your memory consumption issue: for n in 1...5_000_000 { let numStr = String(describing: n) var result = "" autoreleasepool { result = testText.replacingOccurrences(of: "X", with: numStr) } print(result) }
True true. It needs an autoreleasepool.
Yes and the leak detection bar had green checks across the bottom. Still new to Xcode. I took that to mean it didn't see an issue. I'm stress testing a type. I would never assume it would be called more than a few thousand times in any run. But bad code is bad code. 
Exactly! looks like a leek but the Instruments were happy with it.
Jasemer! Thank you so much for this! Great explanation! I knew it had something to do with forcing garbage collection. just wan't sure how best to go about it.
I never responded to this, but I'm just going to wait -- or buy it at full price when I have the money! Again, your writing has really helped me and who knows, I may move back into the professional software development world again!
It's very similar, you can use back Swift for macOS, and many of the things are the same, like Foundation, UserDefaults, URLSession, GCD, Notification Center etc.. Main difference would be UI stuff, there's some UI that's only available to Mac such as menu bar, windows etc. If you know iOS development already, jumping to macOS will be easy for you. I did a presentation on this topic last week, here's the slide if you are interested: https://speakerdeck.com/soulchild/similarities-between-macos-and-ios-development
I used Ray Wenderlich's macOS tutorials to build my first mac app, their tutorials are quite good: https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos
Thanks for the info on the AttributedString. What Im still unclear to do however is parsing of the text. The app is drawing its app content from a JSON file hosted on Github so targeting specific words or blocks of text is something I dont know how to do. For instance, this Youtuber shows how to use NSAttributedString: [https://youtu.be/4WxrJhyb0oQ?t=837](https://youtu.be/4WxrJhyb0oQ?t=837) But as you can see the app content isnt hosted in a JSON file, but the actually app itself. Could you elaborate more as to how I'd make these changes?
&gt; in it's code in its* code it's = it is or it has 
I always thought autorelease pool was some form of black magic, but it's actually quite simple. Check out this great explanation: https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2011-09-02-lets-build-nsautoreleasepool.html

I can’t vouch for the Swift 4 course which covers MacOS, but I took Ro Percival’s Swift 3 course on Udemy and it was amazing. I do know the new one covers all the new features, including MacOS development.
I will take that course, it is on my udemy wishlist!, thank you.
I just got your course on udemy, loving it!
Thanks. I did, but I have a custom cell so I don't see the "line separator" Here is what I see: https://imgur.com/a/6fan0G6
Thanks. How would I add a layer to the cell? is there a built-in method within the class UITableViewCell that I need to use? 
Not important. Select the table view in the vc. You should be able to see separator options on the right side menu (first lines)
Cool guys! I’m working on learning Swift.....
Hey! I downloaded ur app and played it a bit. Here are my recommendations. The game itself is pretty good. I like that. There’s something about the setup that I don’t like. Maybe a full screen UI, of where the game covers the screen edge to edge. And there are still to many ads. Maybe do add every 4 minutes or so. Great game!
What benefit would supporting cross platform development bring them? They're already the primary platform; the one that some 95% of developers target. Supporting cross platform development would just benefit their competitors, making apps available on the other platforms. 
&gt;Now if another company makes an Android only App, it’s Apple that loses. The amount of these that are out there, and the amount of money they bring in is minuscule compared to the opposite, iOS only apps. 
Ah. I see the option. However, despite changing the option to single-line etched black, it's not appearing when running the app. Any idea what could be wrong? https://imgur.com/ZjL7VOi https://imgur.com/5Q0DpZj 
Just keep it clear, this is not actually garbage collection - it's still ARC (Automatic Reference Counting). The difference is that you define a smaller scoop for checking for auto released objects to get them released earlier. Mac apps used to be able to be compiled with garbage collection, but it has since been superseded by ARC. 
Apples documentation is amazing. Stanford has a great course on iTunes U and YouTube. Reach out if you get stuck!
Thanks! Will do!
Pm me if you want I am 13% of the way into that course. I’m totally new to coding as well. 
Cool! Will do! Thanks a ton
Please paste the relevant parts if you want any answers. "crashes" is super vague. What's the actual error? 
Thanks for the link.
I’m not sure about Auth, but the rest is just the same as you’d on web. Do POST/GET requests from your iOS app to your backend and that’s about it. You may want to use alamofire for that.
Depending on how complicated your text is it might be enough to search for start and end tick marks and then just change the font of the text in between. A simple way would be to loop through each character of your text and make note of the start and end points. Then simply split up your text and change the font on the relevant substrings. Something like a binary search would be faster, especially on large chunks of text. There's some good search algorithms on the [Ray Wenderlich Swift Algorithm Club github](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club), if speed becomes an issue. 
Sorry, I've updated the OP with the error. 
Thanks for the feedback and glad you enjoyed it!
This might hurt performance? If it's a performance sensitive loop you could do it in batches... say, 100000 per autorelease scope?
Is it worth the purchase on the App Store. I’m looking for something to replace the Apple weather app 
Its not a book but if you are looking for the best resource to learn swift I would recommend the iOS Stanford course. You can find it for free on iTunes U 
i will check it out thanks!
When you use commercial APIs like Wiki, Weather and others, they have you get a key and go thru a process to register your app. These tutorials have nothing about generating a key for the apps. If I were to make the above example from Mosh and put Vidly on Heroku or AWS, then how would you (or I) be able to use it in your iOS app? I'd have to have a process where you get a key, you'd have to make the connection, then you'd have to make the calls. I've seen quite a few tutorials that show how to do this with a public API like Weather, I've seen tutorials that show how to build the backend with Node.js and Mongo (linked above), but I can't seem to find one that gets into how to connect the iOS app to the custom backend you've just created. Even the web connection doesn't do anything for Auth, making keys or even a login routine. Most just stop at the "localhost..." connection where you spit out/ update records, etc...
Wait about one week and search Simple Weather 2 (shameless plug)
Check out the stuff by Ray Wenderlich. Hard copies or e-books. Good stuff.
This is the first time that I am seeing a wider variety of what Siri Shortcuts is capable of and I gotta day, hhhhrrrrrrnnnnnnggggg. 
+1 to Stanford course
In the console you can see "**\[testProduct.FirstTableViewCell handleTap:\]: unrecognized selector sent to instance"** The method to be called needs to have @objc above it. Change the setup to: **let** recognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: **self**, action: **#selector**(FirstTableViewCell.handleTap(recognizer:))) and all works. Having said that, for this case you really just want to catch taps on the cell. You could do all of this in a storyboard with a segue and no code.
Not /u/twostraws, so not self-advertising. He’s probably just a fan of the Hacking series (I’m a fan of it too).
I’m not looking for a job since I’m still learning iOS and preparing to become baby dev, but this post is awesome! 
I'm debating building an app in react native over swift. Can you explain more? I'm very familiar with react and fairly familiar with swift. 
Guess i was just ignorant
This works. Thank you. I actually have a question regarding the change in syntax as the original code I used was found on Stackoverflow. I just need to find that thread now :(. As for your second point, I agree. I figured out this wasn't way to go in the middle of this mini-project, but I wanted to finish it up to for learning purposes. Thank you!
I am in the same boat. I recently found coding with Chris. he's got small series or videos with a couple challenges at the end. I'm only on the 4th lesson so I can't say much as to how in depth it gets but so far its been good I think. Im going to be checking out the Stanford course too
I have the same issue. Have you filed a bug with Apple? I will do so after this comment. My code executes just fine, I just get errors when an image is referenced (and of course, no images are displayed).
Swift has changed rapidly, for the better, over the past few years and you'll find lots of old code out there. Best to specifically search for swift 4. I noticed your Xcode project was old. Unless you want to submit very soon I would grab the Xcode 10 beta and start using swift 4.2.
I’m not sure my sample code results in race condition. My assumption is if we use queues or locks, thread safety can also be achieved with class types. If using value types alone doesn’t guarantee thread safety, why are they recommended?
Thread safety has different parts. One part: avoiding deadlocks. Another part: ensure correctness when data is shared between threads.
Thanks! So to be specific, I should say the concern is about the second part.
Yes--you're concerned with "thread safe access to shared data". Structs are always copied, never shared, so no potential for issues. Also, to clarify my comment about reference types here: Reference types (structs containing a reference to a value) are also immutable and copied... but once you copy a reference, the original and the copy now both refer to the same value, effectively sharing it between threads! That's when you can get into trouble.
Is my sample code(method1 and method2) in my SO question “dangerous”?
Not sure it's dangerous, but I'm not sure it does what you want either. func method2() { var a = Account(balance: 3) { didSet { print("Account changed") } } func updateAccount(account : Account) { a = account } let queue = DispatchQueue.global() queue.async { [a] in var temp = a // since `a` is a struct, it will be copied into `temp` temp.increase() // problem: if your async hander is interrupted on this line, now `temp` here and `temp` on the main queue both have the same copy of `a`. They will both write new copies of `a` with balance incremented by 1, when you really want `a` to be incremented by 2 after both blocks run. updateAccount(account: temp) // write back print("global: \(temp.balance)") } DispatchQueue.main.async { [a] in var temp = a temp.increase() updateAccount(account: temp) print("main: \(temp.balance)") } } 
Do they do public bug tracking? If so link me to your report and I will star it. Otherwise I’ll file one too. I wasn’t sure if it was an error on my part but I can’t seem to get it working. 
It’s a sad state of affairs when automation on iOS begins to outpace automation on the Mac. 
That’s very clear! Really appreciate your help:)
Pardon me, just a second thought: If I use the same queue, it doesn’t matter if it’s class or struct? Then the question come back again: if queue+class and queue+struct are equivalent, what’s the advantage of using struct? 
thanks
That was the error. Thank you! I was following an Apple swift learning guide. 
It sounds really weird. It’s a very simple thing you should get for free using a table view. It’s difficult to help you in this way. First of all, try with graphic debugger to see what’s happening. Then, try to create a new vc with the simplest table view implementation you can get (you should be able to see separators because they are a default option) and diff with what you have already done
In provided example, struct does not really give you anything. You can have race conditions with struct too: func makeRaceCondition() { struct Foo { var value = 1 mutating func mutate() { value += 1 } } var a = Foo() for _ in 0..&lt;100 { DispatchQueue.global().async { a.mutate() } } } This is because declared variable `a` will be allocated on heap so that other threads can access it. But, you can use copy semantics to implement cool stuf for threading purposes, for example: /// If T is a struct, then this class provides thread safety, because all reads and writes happen inside queue. /// But, if T is very big, copying it may decrease performance. /// If T was a mutable reference type, this class would be basically useless. class SafeAccess&lt;T&gt; { private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "Safe") private var _value: T init(_ value: T) { _value = value } var value: T { get { var result: T! queue.sync { result = _value // entire struct will be copied } return result } set { queue.sync { self.value = newValue } } } }
Thank you. I have a question regarding “If T was a mutable reference type, this class would be basically useless.” If the access is sequential, why doesn’t it apply to reference types?
OP's code clearly seems like an example, but yeah, if your loop does something very light weight and is performance critical, it may be worth it to do batches.
Because inside queue.sync, you would only copy the pointer to the data. If you later modify that data it will not be inside queue and could result in race conditions, etc.
Mike Ash kicks ass :-) Of course it's not actually black magic, but if you haven't heard about autorelease(pools), the fact that this weird `autoreleasepool` line makes the memory issue go away kind of seems like "magic".
Working on my first tvOS app, video news. I’m still a begginer and this is really great experience for me.
Question 1: Say there are two threads t1 and t2 accessing a SafeAccess instance. t1 gets a copy of value and t2 gets a copy, t1 sets value based on its copy(+1 for example) and then t2 does the same, the final value will be +1, not +2. So SafeAccess is not safe in that case, is it? Question 2: If we use a reference type T, and we make the value in SafeAccess readonly, then we can mutate the object in a queue to use it safely, right? Excuse me...
I liked Hacking with Swift too. He has a free swift course to teach the syntax that you could probably skip. It is aimed at beginners but I found I could blast through the pdf pretty quickly and get familiar enough with apples frameworks to get started.
Q1. you are correct, for this you could use special method for read/write, where read and write happens in the same queue item: https://gist.github.com/szotp/b21dbfee1f4d6f66f8f5b434e76c32eb Q2: Actually, it's the opposite, you don't change SafeAccess class, you make your T class immutable so the only way to change SafeAccess.value is to go through the method.
If you understand how to send requests via a browser then that part is pretty simple. You just need to configure a request with the type and your data, send it off and wait for a response. There are questions on other sites that cover using URLRequest but as mentioned earlier, Alamofire is really useful. They have some good examples on their GitHub page [https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md) The Hacking with Swift Vapor book covers building server side apps in swift. I managed to put together an app with basic auth a while ago using it. The routes on your server app can deal with auth, e.g: /register route takes request object with a username and password, checks if there's a matching username in the database and returns a response object (success or fail) - your iOS app can look at the response and save the user details or ask for different ones if its a valid new user, the server app will save the (encrypted) details to the database /login route can take a req object with username and password, check they both match whats in the database and return a response object with a token if correct - your iOS app can save the token and use it for making get requests, etc. /get routes can take a request object containing a token (amongst other things). if the token matches a valid one in the database, the data can be sent back same for post, delete route You need to be careful and use encryption/password hashing. I too did a node course and was left utterly confused by this. Now I've covered the basics, I think I'll be ready to figure out using libraries like OAuth for more secure authentication.

You should learn about cqrs. It feels bloaty in the beginning, but improves maintainability by a lot, if the api you are working with is in fact, huge.
What’s cqrs, sorry could you elaborate on that please. Is it a book or 
Because you are junior dev it is always helpful to understand apples own networking api. Study material might be boring so I suggest u watch videos on YouTube there are tons of good videos on this subject watch as many as possible because each YouTuber has got his unique understanding of networking and I guess those videos should be more than sufficient then you can read Apple docs or find material on Raywanderlinch.com
Thank you guys for helping! 
Thanks for the detailed response! So the getting data to and from the web service is done with Alamofire or network calls, JWT (JSON Web Tokens for security) and OAuth for Auth. I've used all of those, but I haven't done the OAuth on the server or made any key for the client. I've used OAuth for other apps, but not when I made the backend with Node/Mongo. Kinda sad that the cert program that I just finished didn't cover these things. I see that you can use a number of sign in services like Google and LinkedIn, but for some reason this was fully left out of the cert program. When you say : \&gt; You need to be careful and use encryption/password hashing. You're talking about JWT? \&gt; I too did a node course and was left utterly confused by this. Now I've covered the basics, I think I'll be ready to figure out using libraries like OAuth for more secure authentication. I'm glad I'm not the only one, what source are you using to study the OAuth?
Can you suggest some videos to watch?
Yes, getting data to and from the server can be done with alamofire. It’s good practise to not store the users password as plain text. Instead you can store a hash of it. JWTs can, amongst other things, be used like a cookie in the browser. If the user has a valid token they don’t need to send their password with every request. Depending on your use case, you may want to encrypt data that you store on the server and / or data that you’re sending over the network. I’m working on a SpriteKit game for now so not going to dive into auth for a while yet.

I would look at the examples for AFNetworking and AlamoFire for simplified versions of the iOS networking interface. https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire Additionally, here is a good best practice video from Apple: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/711/
Networking itself is pretty easy and high level for iOS devs, unless you are doing something other than REST/HTTP. What would help is understanding how GCD, operation queues, and general async programming works on iOS. A major chunk of networking layers is basically dealing with async code and creating even higher level abstractions over what the SDK provides. 
You can only develop apps in Swift on a MacBook or an virtual machine with macOS on it.
Test it on the weakest supported device type without debugger attached in both cases.
Why would singleton be a terrible habit? I’m curious if there is another simple way to do it. 
Dependency injection is a good practice to follow
As an older dev, I find it useful to really understand how IP networking works underneath. Stevens “Unix Network Programming” is the bible. You should also learn about proxy servers (Charles Proxy esp) for debugging, how DNS, SSL, and DHCP work, command-line tools like traceroute, ping, dig, nslookup, etc. Bonjour is sometimes useful for iOS apps too. For example, if you’re sending live audio/video you might want to use UDP instead of TCP, something many junior devs have never heard of. You don’t have to learn this all at once, but getting an overview of what’s under the hood is really helpful for debugging. 
It is a pattern of sorts. Command-Query-Response-Separation. I’m not aware of any books. Basic idea: for a given object type (e.g. member), one file holds all of the functionality for GETTING those objects (query), and another for UPDATING (command). The idea can be pushed further to background services for all commands (I rarely need that). For what you need, for iOS networking, none of that. It is more of a backend pattern that would be useful with the php side of things. My suggestion: learn how to use some of the desktop http/rest client tools. I like Insomnia. First figure out how to make the calls using that, then write the corresponding code in iOS. But then you have a good idea the call works already and you don’t have to worry that you messed up something in your code.
I believe every use case can have a different answer. Here are different approaches I see: - A database - The UserDefaults - Why not in the top level view controller? - Singleton can be fine - A file
structs are for uses where you want your data to be copied (treated as a single value) when it’s assigned to another variable. because of this restriction, structs also get you automatic implementation of Codable. And since Swift knows a struct is immutable (generally) you can get cheap copies... For example, a struct that’s immutable doesn’t have to be copied, it can be shared since it will never change. 
Singletons are looked down upon because they introduce global state. It may be simple to you since you are the only one working on a specific project. However, if you are in a team of developers introducing global state for an object can cause confusion, and objects state being changed that shouldn't be. 
Hmm, will take a look at it
The official one is a good start: [https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) There aren't a huge range of resources that will scale with you from absolute beginner up to expert. The Sanford course might be great, but most other resources will aim at beginner or intermediate or expert level.
Thank you very much 
Cheers 
This is good. Thanks 
I think you are right on this. As for now, I’m familiar with downloading stuff on the background queue and update the UI on the main thread. Cheers 
Sounds like you have a long list of things to study, same here.
Personally, I think the Ray W Swift 4 from Udemy has a networking section that's worth the $10 all by itself. You get all the rest for free and there's a bonus of some 200 training videos on top of that.
I have the Ray W subscription. I’ve seen they have videos on networking. I will check them out. Cheers 
IIRC, is a mature lady that teaches the network series and she was awesome. https://www.udemy.com/ios-and-swift-for-beginners-200-hands-on-tutorials/ Session: Networking With URLSession
Yh those are the videos 
What I’ve done for years is just make an empty swift file with no classes or anything called variables and because they’re not in a class or struct or anything, they’re global, and they’re all in one place. Then it’s easier to use UserDefaults to save them. 
And when I say “this” I wanted to focus on just the “mirroring” of the label not the gage.
Thank you! Saving this to browse through and learn some new stuff!
Really enjoyed the article, thanks! 
Neils, thanks for this. I'll keep it in mind.
try this `self.view.layer.transform = CATransform3DMakeRotation(CGFloat(π), -360.0, 1.0, 0.0)`

Can you tell me if Udemy is a good way for learning Swift or its just a website without anything behind.
This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! Thank you sooo much!
Currently going through a Udemy course on Swift myself and it has helped me a lot. It really depends on who the instructor is. Really recommend Devslopes. 
Ok good to know. If anyone else can tell me what you think. Thank you
Looks good, some tips from a purely personal perspective: When I am looking at intern level resumes, I usually am trying to gauge how much coaching they will require when they join. If you are trying to secure an iOS internship, you may want to break out the skills for iOS into more detail. What versions of swift have you used, what frameworks have you used? (Networking, core data, collection views...) I know the technologies my projects use and don’t expect an intern to join with experience in them, but if your resume checks a few boxes for tech we already use, you have a good chance of being shortlisted. Another couple things you may want to study up on are strengths and weaknesses of MVC pattern (google: massive viewcontroller) a passing knowledge of MVVM or VIPER can be interesting. Unit tests, they suck as they feel like a waste of time. For intermediate to senior positions many know the right answer is to say they are important and why, but few actually use them and can explain best practices. Last piece of advice for this as well as any position you apply for, try to tailor your resume as much as possible for the position posted and send a cover letter. Some managers don’t even read them, but a good cover letter can be a foot in the door and should be customized for each position. It is your chance to explain why they should interview you over any other candidate. Best of luck! A job in IOS programming can be quite enjoyable!
This is awesome! There looks like there is some good stuff. Thanks for posting!
I think the best thing for you to do would be to start to find a groove mentally as far what *type of situation* asks for which *type of data storage.* At a high level, yes, you have a good view of the choices. Which are basically... 1. Pass a value to the view controller, allow the view controller to send an update back up if the view controller modifies the data 2. Store the value as a singleton everyone can access and touch Sure, behind these storage methods maybe you got your data by fetching from an API, or by reading from UserDefaults, but that I believe is more specific to your use case. So between creating an instance of the data model everywhere, or passing the data around as a segue, maybe you could use this as a framework... **If** **you have super-shared, not-really-owned-by-anyone data** (Like, maybe, some data about the API endpoints you want your front end to request from, or a "requests manager" that does specific HTTP things you like, etc, **store that as a singleton or, if you can get away with it, static variables that don't even need to be initialized to be accessed.** **If you have data that is being examined in detailed contexts** (like, maybe, a notes app where you have a master&gt;detail situation with a list of notes, and then you push in view controllers where you can edit the notes, or a similar thing where users have a set of projects or a single project and modify different sections in detail view controllers, **become familiar with "delegate" patterns so you can pass the data to a child view controller, set the parent view controller as the somethingSomethingDelegate of the child view controller, and allow the child view controller to call a function on the delegate methods of the parent view controller to really precisely send back up the updated object so the parent view controller can save it, refresh the list, etc.** Try different things and follow your intuition! You're probably right :)
You should check out the book [iOS Apps with REST APIs](https://leanpub.com/iosappswithrest)
Thanks. It turned out that it wasn't showing up when testing with the simulators, but when I used a real phone the lines were showing up. Thank you for your help!
Thank you. Looks very useful. 
first time app is run* 
Even more weird. Never happened to me! 
The way I usually do this is to store some variable in `UserDefault`. In your code you'll need to check if the variable exist, if not you set it and run the rest of your function, if it's there then it means the function was already launched once. 
This is why singletons are good.
Ah. Thanks. 
As long you don't let your singleton become one massive global, there isn't much wrong with it. Keep it specialized.
Also you can just check if the folder is there before creating it.
This is the correct way of doing it. 
If you’re looking for paid, Udemy’s course has been really good for me. I went from literally knowing jack shit into programming apps within 1 week. Angela (the lecturer in the course) explains a lot of things to in detail and shows the practicality of each method. Plus she sets challenges at the end of each module and you get to get over them. Plus you can ask questions and she responds within 1-2 weeks. It was on sale for $10 USD and it really helped me get the foundation in programming in a OOP language 
Why isn't this the top reply?!
You don’t want to add segues for a tabcontroller. You should instead be adding the viewcontrollers as children. When you double click on the arrows going to your tab controller what do they say? For reference, here is an example of how to use a tab controller: https://www.raywenderlich.com/160521/storyboards-tutorial-ios-11-part-1
Read up on: - scope - retain / release
A class instance contains properties. Those properties can be object instances.
If something is nil, then how do you expect to call a method within it?
I found this article with a simple Google search, I think it answers your question. [https://learnappmaking.com/shuffling-array-swift-explained/](https://learnappmaking.com/shuffling-array-swift-explained/)
The only property of animal is `isGoodBoy`, lion and doggo and monkey are variables of type `animal?`. The first two are nil, because you set no value. The last one holds an instance of the class animal, aka. an "animal object". (Exactly like the debug area prints). `var lion: animal?` means exactly the same as `var lion: animal? = nil`. `var monkey = animal()` means exactly the same as `var monkey: animal? = animal()`. 
You example var cell: UITableViewCell? basically means that the cell object is of type UITableViewCell and the questionmark tells the compiler that the object cell could have a value but it is not necessary if it doesn’t it is nil
&gt; Here _lion_ and _doggo_ are the properties of of type _animal_ and could potentially be the properties of some other class. _monkey_ on the other hand is the object of _animal_ class. I apologize if I have misunderstood, but the this statement leads me to believe that there is a fault in your understanding of `Optional`. The `?` character after your variables’ type annotation indicates that those particular variables are `Optional`, which means they’re allowed to have the value `nil`; it has nothing to do with the those properties’ underlying class.
I see. Why to use variables instead of objects when both of them have access to the properties and methods of a class. Like the `UITableViewCell` example.
I see so var `cell: UITableViewCell?` is equivalent to `var cell = UITableViewCell ()` but `cell` can be nil?
Yeah, i did explain myself right there. I am just trying to understand why people do this `var cell: UITableViewCell?` instead of `var cell = UITableViewCell()` most of the times. Could you explain this?
There are some more basic concepts of object-oriented programming you don't seem to understand yet... For example, in your code: var lion: animal? // "nil" in the debug area var doggo: animal? // "nil" in the debug area var monkey = animal() // "animal" in the debug area Here you define three variables, lion, doggo and monkey. All variables in swift have a type and a value. In the first two cases, you only assign a type, and the value is nil (nothing, empty, you name it). In the last case, you define a value, and swift knows that it's type must also be animal. Actually, what you wrote is shorthand for: var lion: animal? = nil var doggo: animal? = nil var monkey: animal = animal() The question-mark here is to make it possible to assign nil, it makes the variable's value optional. You can assign a value to it later if you need.
I did not explain myself well there, I understand the concepts. But could you answer the crux of my whole question.. Is `var cell: UITableViewCell?` is equivalent to `var cell = UITableViewCell ()` but `cell` can be `nil` ? That is `cell` is the object of `UITableViewCell` in both the cases?
I understand. Your specific example is a little difficult to work with, so let me provide another example. I recently implemented a class as part of a logging framework. The responsibilities of this class included writing to a file, with the OPTION to have a “max file size”, such that a new file gets started whenever the current log file grows beyond X number of bytes. When instantiating this object, the `maxFileSize` parameter is of type `Int?`, meaning the caller is free to provide either a concrete `Int` value for `maxFileSize`, or otherwise nothing at all (i.e. `nil`) if they don’t want file size checks to be performed to at all.
&gt; When instantiating this **object**, the &gt; &gt;maxFileSize &gt; &gt;parameter is of type &gt; &gt;Int? So this is written as `var maxFileSize: Int?` And you used the word, object to explain the process. And that was my query. Meaning `maxFileSize` is not a property but an object..right? So could you have written it as `var maxFileZise = someClass ()` ?
Pretty soon it will be built-in: [shuffle()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2994753-shuffle) Until then your best bet is a [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24029847/887210) extension MutableCollection { /// Shuffles the contents of this collection. mutating func shuffle() { let c = count guard c &gt; 1 else { return } for (firstUnshuffled, unshuffledCount) in zip(indices, stride(from: c, to: 1, by: -1)) { // Change `Int` in the next line to `IndexDistance` in &lt; Swift 4.1 let d: Int = numericCast(arc4random_uniform(numericCast(unshuffledCount))) let i = index(firstUnshuffled, offsetBy: d) swapAt(firstUnshuffled, i) } } } extension Sequence { /// Returns an array with the contents of this sequence, shuffled. func shuffled() -&gt; [Element] { var result = Array(self) result.shuffle() return result } }
In Swift 4.2 you just use [1, 2, 3, 4].shuffled()
&gt; var monkey = animal() means exactly the same as var monkey: animal? = animal() not exactly, because monkey is not nullable when assigning it an animal(), right?
Oh thank you very much!
Oh thank you very much!
Intro to App Development is a very nice book! I also recommend: “The Swift Programming Language “ which is available for free in iBooks. You can also have a look at: https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/141-your-first-ios-app/lessons/1 (also free) 
Ah, yeah, of course.
Variables give "names" to objects (well, to "things" in general). `animal()` creates an animal object. But you can't access it, because you don't have a name for it. Therefore you do `var monkey = anmial()`. Now you have a variable, `monkey`, which you can use to access the `animal` object. The two are separate concepts and not exchangable. `var cell: CustomCellClass?` says "let there be a variable called cell which can store objects of type CustomCellClass or nothing (aka. nil)". By not assigning a value to it, it gets the default value nil. `var cell: CustomCellClass = CustomCellClass()` says "let there be a variable called cell which can store objects of type CustomCellClass. Create a CustomCellClass object and assign it to this variable. (that's the `CustomCellClass()` part)". You can leave the `: CustomCellClass` part out, because the compiler is smart enough to get that the variable should store `CustomClassCell`s, because that's the thing you assign to the variable. 
His implementation is a little bit convoluted to a newcomer but it's very efficient. It basically does what I explained but uses distance from the front of the array to get a random index and then swaps the current index with the random one.
They are not equivalent. These are equivalent: var cell: UITableViewCell = UITableViewCell() var cell = UITableViewCell() When you do this: var cell: UITableViewCell? = UITableViewCell() You're now saying that `cell` is an `Optional` value. It's actual type is `Optional&lt; UITableViewCell&gt;`. An `Optional` is a "box" that can either hold a value of that type or be empty, also known as `nil`.
Thanks for explaining. It really helped, however, when we do `var cell: CustomCellClass?` and haven't assigned a value or an object to it, we still use it to (or syntax similar to this) to work things out, all the while never assigning a value to the variable. For example, later down in the code, one could use `cell.aProperty` or `cell.aMethod()`, where `aProperty` and `aMethod()` were defined in the `CuscomCellClass()`. And since it is often the case, my query is, why not simply create `var cell = CustomCellClass()` and then do `cell.aProperty` and `cell.aMethod()` then? Thanks
Look around in the code, there is a some other place where an cell object is assigned to the cell variable. Calling methods on nil does nothing (or crashes the app, depending on whether you use ? or !). As for why not do `var cell = CustomCellClass()`, usually it's because 1., cells are usually loaded from a storyboard/xib, and that doesn't work with `CustomCellClass()`; and 2., tableviews reuse cells, so when you need a new cell it's bad practice to always create a new one; you are supposed to check if there is one that you can reuse.
I think the developer is using [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
Reverse image search brings back angular JS but I don’t think thats right, I thought that was a red icon with an A in it. 
&gt; I did not explain myself well there, I understand the concepts. But could you answer the crux of my whole question.. I don't want to be rude, but sorry: no, you don't understand the concepts. If you did, you could answer your own question. 
&gt;Look around in the code, there is a some other place where an cell object is assigned to the cell variable. Calling methods on nil does nothing (or crashes the app, depending on whether you use ? or !). I did and this explains a lot. Virtually any thing that was defined as `var something: aType` , was later assigned to something and only then utilized. I also tried some stuff on playgrounds and as mentioned, calling a method on a variable when it is nil, does nothing...as you said. I also tried to declare it as object and then force downcast it to the desired class, and then after removing the "?" the project worked fine. So far, I have come to the conclusion that we define the variable and not the object because it is a convention or a good habit rather than a necessity. Would I be correct in saying that?
What's the name of this course?
Nice! Now, only if you could help me.
Welcome 
I just bought it. Thanks 
In both cases you define a variable, you do that as soon as you have the `var`. You only have the choice of assigning something to it immediately or not. In general, you should prefer having a constants (`let foo = something`) to variables (`var foo = something`). However, having a variable and not assigning anything initially is not out of convention or because it's a good habit, it's done because it's necessary in some way.
&gt;In both cases you define a variable, you do that as soon as you have the `var` . You only have the choice of assigning something to it immediately or not. I get it now. Thanks for working with me! Been a great help.

AVPlayer doesnt have any controls? Do you mean AVPlayerViewController?
&gt; but you'll still have to fill your View Controller with things that are not supposed to be in it, such as constraint code Is this really the case? Personally, I will generally constrain all the sub-views of a VC’s view within that view (I.e the parent constrains it’s children) Is there a reason not to take that approach when working in a programmatic way?
Yes, sorry
Honestly, the API should not mix types. It should have a definite and predictable interface. If you can't ensure that then you'll have to encode and decode manually, detecting the type and choosing the appropriate value. [Encoding and Decoding Custom Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) If I get a chance later I'll write up a sample implementation.
Thank you, I would appreciate that!
That is 100% Cordova, Cordova is JS/HTML/CSS compiled into a webview (There should be an Xcode project that is created with a WWW folder that contains the code they wrote for the app) Send me a message if you have specific questions I've worked extensively with this awful product... 
Okay will implement this and test it out. Thank you. 
What public API changes types? That's really odd, I can't even imagine why they would do that.
yeah, it is likely a bug. But until they fix it I want to find a workaround if possible so my app doesn't break.
Got it down, thank you.
The easiest way would be to make a type that has an enum with cases `int(value: Int)` and `string(value: String)` and a single member of that enum type. When you read the json in, set the member to the correct enum case with the given value (probably using an if-let), and finally have a computed property that gets you the status.
Overriding `view` was a very common trick in the Objective-C days but it got a bit harder with Swift. I think it's actually easier to just create a `let` called `customView` and assign that in `loadView` so your linter doesn't start swearing at you because you're force-casting.
 import Foundation public enum Status : String, Encodable { case pending, active, locked, disabled, deleted, inactive, unknown, offline, online, failure, inprogress, success, warning } extension Status { static let allCases: [Status] = [ .pending, .active, .locked, .disabled, .deleted, .inactive, .unknown, .offline, .online, .failure, .inprogress, .success, .warning] init?(value: Int) { guard let index = Status.allCases.index(Status.allCases.startIndex, offsetBy: value, limitedBy: Status.allCases.endIndex) else { return nil } self = Status.allCases[index] } } extension Status: Decodable { public enum StatusError: Error { case badValue } public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws { let container = try decoder.singleValueContainer() if let value = try? container.decode(String.self), let decoded = Status(rawValue: value) { self = decoded return } if let value = try? container.decode(Int.self), let decoded = Status(value: value) { self = decoded return } throw StatusError.badValue } } struct Foo: Codable { let status: Status } let test = """ { "status" : 1 } """ if let data = test.data(using: .utf8), let value = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Foo.self, from: data) { print(value.status) // "active" } 
This looks like Extension-Material, very nice!
I mean, it is all done in extensions already. I didn't bother with coding keys because it's just an example, fit it to your own use case. Honestly though, it's best to have the server produce predictable interfaces rather than play a guessing game. This kind of trial-and-error JSON decoding should only be done if you have no choice.
Would need to be a var, and then you have to remember to set in two places. My preferred set-up these days: var myView: MyCustomView! { return view as? MyCustomView } override func loadView() { let myView = MyCustomView() // set-up view inputs/outputs, nested VCs, etc. myView.addGestureRecogniser(...) view = myView } Similar semantics to the default view property so slots in cleanly. To generalise, I guess you could also add a setter, so you don’t risk forgetting to set the view property at end of loadView, and then standardise on the view naming, so: var baseView: MyCustomView! { set (view) { self.view = view } get { return view as? MyCustomView } } override func loadView() { baseView = MyCustomView() // set-up view inputs/outputs, nested VCs, etc. baseView.addGestureRecogniser(...) }
From what I gather, the author really wants to keep all view related stuff out of the view controller. So he says: even if you would move all view related stuff in a custom view, then still you'd have to set up constraints in the view controller. He really, \*really\* wants a clean and tight view controller, so I can see how constraints are an eye sore. Which he fixes with loadView().
Good trick, quite obvious now that you mention it.
Yay, AudioKit! 
Yes, that's my point: you shouldn't *need* to set-up constraints in the View Controller either – so your view controller can be even lighter. If a view is responsible for all its children – in many cases – it can also be responsible for setting up the constraints of its children. For me, this is a view responsibility. For the constraints of the outer view (the view vended by the View Controllers `view` property), there are two possibilities: 1) In the case of the root view controller, these are set when the view controller is assigned to the window, so it's a non-issue 2) For contained view controllers, these should be set when they are added to their parent View Controller, in the parent view controller. Even in this case though, I generally add methods to the Container View Controller's view that establishes these constraints. Therefore the VC remains mostly clean of layout code.
I agree as everybody else that it's bad practice to write that kind of API. Maybe its several versions handling the same endpoint? Nevermind. I made the code [reusable](https://gist.github.com/Limdi/d6a4f8bf7c0f428b5eac1cca81ba66cf).
The thing is that if you don't use something like loadView(), someone will eventually have to constrain the parent view to the View Controller's default view - likely the VC itself. This is something that is subjective to each architecture, but I personally like having the VC not have to bother with this kind of stuff, making this a cool trick since loadView() automatically constrains your view to the VC's edges.
Yes, you should leave the responsibility of constraining a view controller's view to the *parent* view controller. If you want to be rid of almost all layout code in your view controllers, then specifically, you should leave the responsibility of constraining a view controller's view to the parent view controller's *view*.
It's pretty specific to be made into a protocol like that, probably overkill. I'd prefer to keep that on a case-by-case basis. If I have a bunch of types for which I need that code then I probably should think about the API I'm connecting to and find something better.
OK, now I see what you mean. To be honest, most of the view controllers that I have created (and have reviewed) take the approach of just gathering a bunch of standard classes, setting a whole bunch of properties and actions, and then laying constraints over them. You seem to be creating a lot more custom views. I don't think most people do that.
Must be at least the 6th time I’ve recommended this, so that suggests how good it is: check out Angela Yu’s Udemy course. I picked it up for £10 and it is fantastic! You learn by doing, and making actual apps. It was the perfect way to learn my first language. If it’s your first language, I’d recommend taking extra care and actually repeating the bits that she suggests you to. Happy learning!
&gt; It's pretty specific to be made into a protocol like that, probably overkill. That may be so. Doing this does however help me learn what the important parts are and to have an easy accessible example which I can refine as needed. You having the ability to just write it down in a few minutes don’t need it, but I do until I have it down. &gt; Also, why make the error fileprivate when the protocol is public? I don’t handle errors this specific. If the json API is so bad that even the BinaryDecodableEnum decoding fails, I’d rather think the endpoint is bad and handle that elsewhere.
It's a good pattern for the most part, putting stuff in protocols for reuse. Just like most things, it can be done too much but I see your point in saving it like this. Even if you don't use the error it's still a good idea to give it the proper access level.
To start with, Java objects are all reference types, so if you pass an object into a function and then modify it then the changes will be visible anywhere else that has a reference to that object. For instance: ``` let foo = { id: 3, name: "Romana" }; const bar = baz =&gt; baz.name = "Fred"; console.log(foo.name); // "Romana" bar(foo); console.log(foo.name); // "Fred" ``` Whereas structs are value types, so whenever you modify a struct passed into a function, only that function's copy of the struct is changed. ``` struct Foo { id: Int, name: String } func bar(_ foo: Foo) { var foo = foo foo.name = "Fred" } var foo = Foo(id: 3, name: "Romana") print(foo.name) // "Romana" bar(foo) print(foo.name) // "Romana" ``` The closest thing in Swift to JavaScript objects would be `class`es which are also reference types. In addition, all JavaScript objects are effectively a dictionary of [String: Any], (foo["name"] is exactly equivalent to foo.name, and you can even add new properties like this) so it's very easy to dynamically add properties to any given object. Properties in Swift can only be added to a type as a whole, and stored properties can only be placed in a types main definition. If you want a more thorough guide to how types and variables work in Swift then I suggest you read the [language guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read).
I mean if you don't plan to develop games you can, but I would maybe get a more powerful second-hand Mac honestly
Sort of but not quite. In Swift there are 3 main object types: `struct`, `enum`, `class`. They are wrappers around properties and associated methods. The differences between them are: - `struct` - can have a synthesized initializer method - is a value type: when passed around you get a copy and not a reference - can not have a property of their own same type - `enum` - preset instances which can not be changed - they can have a default raw value of another type - instances can hold associated data if they do not have a default raw value - can have a associated data of their own same type - is a value type: when passed around you get a copy and not a reference - `class` - is a reference type: passing around an instance creates a reference - can have properties with their own same type All the Swift types are fixed at compilation time, they can't have properties or methods added on the fly. Now my JavaScript is very rusty. However, from what I remember I'd say they all fulfill some of what JavaScript objects do, with `class` being the closest since both a Swift `class` and a JavaScript object are reference types. 
Great explanation! 
I updated the gist for you. :-)
Works perfectly! Awesome job, thank you :)
Ok, I'm gonna be straightforward here, the keyboard SUCKS ASS, and if you are going to code, pleeeease go to an Apple Store an try to code 100 lines and test it; if you manage not to throw the computer at a Genius face. Then Buy it. I code (python mostly) and do some light pentesting, I spend 90% of my time in the terminal, therefore keyboard is extremely important to me. I sold my mac got myself an X1 Carbon and installed Linux, I couldn't stand the god damn keyboard. Just please make sure you test it thoroughly. Don't make the same mistake I did.
JavaScript is not Java. (Your first sentence)
Gah, thank you. I can't believe I let an obvious typo like that through.
😇
TBH the if you are going to code, the MBA has the best keyboard. Macbook Pro keyboard sucks. The only thing that would worry me is the screen real estate, unless you use an external monitor. The Macbook Pro have the worst keyboard ever, then again you can use an external keyboard. It's up to you to see what you want to sacrifice in terms of mobility. Eiter you can live with 1440x900 resolution, or have better power and resolution but having the worst keyboard ever. As /u/dingir- says, if you don't need to use graphic intensive apps, it should do. Be sure to max out the RAM, XCode can get hungry.
I have a 2017 pro and I love the keyboard. Just takes a little getting used to. 
I did spend time on my MBP and never got used to it, maybe cause at work I have Bluetooth Apple keyboard, and spent more time on it rather than on my Mac but, every time I got back home, it felt noisy, the lack of key travel was annoying and sometimes I had the "feeling" It wasn't typing at all. Although I've been told that the new keyboards suck less, after the fiasco of the 2017 one getting damaged with dust. https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/macbook-pro-keyboard-problems-3653458/
one thing to add to `enum`: * cannot have any stored properties, only computed properties
Good call, there’s a bunch of little details like that. To add to this, you can have type stored properties but not instance ones. 
Is the mat lab code complex? Could you recreate it natively?
My best idea right now is to implement the trapezium rule or some alternative in hard code, swift, to get the desired result. This is within my limits, however I’m interested to see if there is an elegant solution from MATLAB
No? ```class CustomViewController&lt;CustomView: UIView&gt;: UIViewController { let customView = CustomView() override func loadView() { view = customView } }```
I understand. I remember looking at this, albeit briefly, a few years back but didn’t find a solution then. I’d be interested in what you work out!
Thanks, hope it helps.
This is bad practice from the API but there's a work around. I had to do this when consuming services that returned "null" occasionally for integer fields and that blew up the decoder. I can't share that code exactly, but the trick is to use JSONDecoder().singleValueContainer().decode(T). First try to decode a field as an int. If you catch an error there, try to decode as a string. Below is a working example that does something similar with Date Strings. First it tries to decode timeless dates, then it tries datetimes: https://github.com/UberNick/CodableTester/blob/master/CodableTester/DateString.swift That same folder has a test suite to demonstrate how it's used. You can use that demo project as a starting point to test your stuff. Feel free to submit pull requests to add examples.

This answer is much smaller and less comprehensive than the others, I came from JavaScript too. If you’re looking for a variable that mimics ‘Object()’ you can use ‘[String:Any]’ but it becomes a bit gnarly because you have to do some casting when retrieving data from it.
They are similar in the sense that you have a bunch of values (properties) referenced by a single variable. aVaraible.aValue = “hi” But in JavaScript you build the object on the fly. Attaching chucks of code to dynamically allocated properties. In swift you define the class ahead of time and the compiler handles all the “building”. You don’t get the dynamic behavior. (Unless you work for it, but it gets messy fast.) 
TakePhoto is an IBAction, you of course can't round an action. You have to round the IBOutlet of the button
No. The reason you don’t do this is because views should be instantiated lazily - they can be quite heavy - so that the view controller can be initialised without consuming a ton of resources. Imagine you’re loading a tab view. You don’t want to initialise the view for every tab when you initialise the tab view controller. The way view controllers are designed means the view is only loaded when the view is actually inserted into the view hierarchy.
This is hard to answer without getting super into a lot of details. The short story is: nothing in Swift is *the equivalent* of JS objects. (I'm going to ignore inheritance and a few other exotic Swift features for simplicity.) JS objects are weird, amorphous things you reference and can add properties to on a whim. If I ask you for "an object", I have no clue what you're giving me. So generally I have to ask you for, "an object but make sure it has these properties". You can put more properties on that object than I ask for and it's fine, but if you don't give me exactly the ones I expect stuff goes wrong. And I don't have a really good way to tell you that other than documentation. I can also choose to add properties to it. If I tell you that, you can use those properties. No problem. And if I stop adding those properties without telling you, you're hosed and may not know. Swift structs are defined ahead of time, and are not reference types. (More on that later.) The important difference here is even Swift classes are defined ahead of time. You don't add properties later. So when I ask for a `Person`, it has to be a specific `Person` struct with specific properties. You can't give me anything else. Your code won't even compile if you try. And if I want to add some properties to the `Person` you give me, I can't. I have to return some different struct with a different name so you know, with guarantees, what properties it has. JS sort of makes an equivalence between objects and dictionaries, which is why this works. Swift doesn't have that kind of context. Now, the distinction between "value" and "reference" also matters. Let's say I have a Swift struct called `Apple`. I'm holding it in my hand, it's an apple. Now let's say I want an apple in my other hand. I have to grab a different apple. Maybe it's the same kind, weight, shape, etc. as my first one, but it's important that there are two hands holding two different apples. There is no way I can hold one `Apple` in two hands in this metaphor. It just doesn't work. This is what we call a "value type". Structs *are* the values they represent, and every variable refers to a unique struct. JS objects are reference types. So if I have a JS `Apple` in one hand, it's more like there is a crate with many apples in it somewhere, each numbered. I have a piece of paper in my hand with a '3' on it. So if you ask me which apple is mine, I tell you the one numbered 3. Metaphorically, I hold the apple in my hand, even though realistically I hold a piece of paper. Now, imagine I get a new piece of paper and write '3' on it, and put it in the other hand. Now, each hand holds something that represents an apple. But both hands represent the *same* apple. That's how reference types work. The variables are not the thing itself, but instead are more like the address where that thing lives. So for reference types, you can have many variables that share the same underlying thing. Swift classes are reference types. So they are more like JS objects than structs. But it's still true that both structs and classes are predefined things with a fixed set of properties and functions. If you try to pass something that isn't EXACTLY the type a function expects, Swift won't compile. JS is a lot more wishy-washy. Classes exist, but they're just a formality over object construction. It's only through tools like Typescript that JS objects start to feel like Swift structs/classes. 
Yeah sure, that would work as well. Actually inside of my UIViews I load subviews always lazily. The main point is that if you flip it around like this you don't have any forced casting anymore.
Per my knowledge, MATLAB coder is still available as effectively a toolbox you can purchase, but I believe it’s quite expensive. Alternatively, if you don’t want to rewrite the code to be native Swift, MATLAB also offers the Compiler toolbox, which you should be able to use to create an executable and distributable version of your tool, with the notable exception that you’ll need the MATLAB runtime (free) available to run it. This toolbox is also pretty expensive. If your code isn’t too complex, I’d recommend just translating it to Swift directly. It’ll be cleaner in the long run, and probably more performant. 
Ah! Interesting. First time using button as both an outlet and an action. Thank you!
Yes, that works. Generally, I’d agree it pays to be mindful when employing forced-casting, but in this case it’s mirroring system behaviour; view is already a forced optional.
I don’t think there’s a straight conversion, but you can rewrite it in Swift using the [Accelerate Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate). 
Thank you for the advice. Yes MATLAB Coder is expensive, I have applied for a trial so we’ll see how that goes.
Ahh this is very helpful to know about, thank you!
And the best advice is: avoid doing this Swift is a strongly-typed language, avoiding that is fighting tons of advantages the language gives you like compile-time checking, type safety, generics, and so much more. Swift is not JavaScript, don't try to force it into the same programming patterns. You'll have a very difficult time working with the language and frameworks if you do.
I know, I’m very excited about the changes coming in 4.2 :-D

That may change with Swift 4.2 and [Dynamic Member Lookup](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md), you could probably have an object backed by a hashmap into which you can dynamically add and remove properties. &gt; from what I remember I'd say they all fulfill some of what JavaScript objects do, with class being the closest since both a Swift class and a JavaScript object are reference types. I'd agree with that.

Is this advertising? 
In terms of usability, I think it’s fine. Runs Xcode and compile project without much problem. Haven’t used it on larger and more complex projects, so if you aren’t looking at that, then it’s a rather capable machine. I even have a coworker using the 11” MBA from a few years ago, so you can definitely get by with it. But having a better screen and more compute power will make your workflow and learning way better. At this stage though, I personally won’t recommend anybody to buy it even for casual use because it’s really due for a refresh. But if cost is your main consideration, then by all means, go ahead – it’s a fine machine to run Xcode on. I recommend you look at the refurbished MBP, might be able to find one that’s from 2016/2017. 
It's affiliate spam.
Thanks! Removed as spam.
Do you use Nibs/xib files to setup MyView? Do you have a custom initializer which you call on viewDidLoad to play around with @IBLoaded variables? Or do you do it it some other way, I would be interested how you call it after it is inserted in the view hierarchy.
Any current MacBook can run Xcode with any problems. Since it’s all you can afford, then go for it. If you’re learning at home, you can always get a monitor later if the screen is too small. Another option is a refurbished MacBook on Apple’s site. I have bought four of them over the years and never had a problem. They arrive looking new and function just as well. Good luck on your Swift adventure!
Dingir is correct. Also remove “AnyObject” as the parameter. You can just call the button directly in the function.
The types are still fixed at compilation time, you're just adding syntactic sugar to a subscript lookup. You can do the same thing right now, this proposal just makes it cleaner to perform. Like most things it can be abused. You're generally best off keeping to the strongly-typed design that Swift is based upon and using this kind of flexibility for interoperability with more dynamic languages, as it was intended.
You usually don't override `performSegue` (and I don't see a reason to do that either), instead you invoke that method. What you override is `prepareForSegue` to send data to the destination view controller.
I ve found a solution. If you are writing simple code or trying to learn swift, open through macos rather than ios. The ios simulation crashes I dont know why but this solution worked for me
I recommend using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) instead of MATLAB. It is much [faster](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/), open source and it supports [HDF5](https://github.com/JuliaIO/HDF5.jl) file format, which can be read by MATLAB and [Swift](https://github.com/alejandro-isaza/HDF5Kit). Julia, can also link with other [LLVM](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/devdocs/llvm/) and [C](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/c/) language libraries.
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

What I really like about Swift is the community that has built around it. I don’t tend to see many podcasts and YouTube videos discussing C and otherwise in such depth and with such enthusiasm.
What’s the difference between slack and discord? 
Great question! Slack costs money at a certain point, while Discord is always free. Discord is also less of a massive memory hog than the Slack desktop client :)
YMMV. OP says it's less of a memory hog, but I find Discord often maxes out my CPU when doing even a small amount of work. Both Discord and Slack are pretty terrible for performance, though!
Googling “barcode scanner Swift” should get you started

Funny enough, they’re abandoning React Native in favor of native.
Ah i saw this pop up on a website, if its so good i will have to give it a shot, cant complain for a tenner. Thank you &lt;3
Thank you so much for the help, i will be checking all of this out &lt;3
I never knew that detail about pricing. That explains why more and more online communities are flocking to Discord even though it’s pretty clearly geared towards gamers.
I'll second this approach. I'm currently wrapping up a new feature that's about 6 person months of code, all coded UI, and it's got just one view controller which is only 40 LOC. That's a bit extreme because it's a very custom layered UI rather than a nav stack or tab bar that forces you to use VCs. However, I really like not having VCs. All the views are custom and do all their styling and constraints in init. It feels a lot cleaner than doing all your view work in views rather than something that's not actually a view. It's also pretty kind of nice for debugging complex UIs when you don't have a bazilion generic UIViews.
one big difference is that discord on safari doesn't support voice. which makes it not a very apple friendly place to hold apple discussion.
Can you explain what you've tried and what not working? Have you tried creating an empty text view and ui image and setting their values when the user performs an action, stuck as clicking on the image?
imagemagick 
I'd be curious to know more about your specs / the situations you see that. It's definitely not the norm and something we'd be happy to investigate/fix.
Bit confusing to me when we have multiple of these ... Not affiliated, but when I was looking through reddit earlier I found another Swift Discord @ [https://discord.gg/R7KSZS](https://discord.gg/R7KSZS)
Hi, are you saying I should include this within the performSegue method? Thank you. 
That's your `prepare(:_)` code. I just thew in the navigation part. If you replace your `prepare(:_)` code with the above, that should take care of that particular issue. 
Ignore this. I just ran your code. There's another issue. I'll PM you.

I still use a 2013 and found no reason to upgrade so far. But maybe I'm just not living right. I've been working with ARKit a lot lately but that needs the phone to test anyway. 
They all use Electron which is a horrible resource hog. (Also, greetings from Bristol!)
I guess you can have another case (e.g: `case other(Int)`) and implement Decodable yourself, it's just a big switch-case.
Electron is a horrible resource hog if your not aware of the way it works, and you don't combat its behavior. We put a lot of effort into ensuring our client is optimized (including things like implementing parts of our app in native libraries), and generally you'll see that payoff (thus my follow up on this thread). I'm personally in around 40 servers, 20 of which are quite large and my app sits at around 300Mb memory (on a modern linux kernel), which is quite reasonable imo. Additionally in my day to day use (keep in mind we use Discord to build Discord, so we see a lot of activity) the client sits around 1% CPU on my i7-4930K. Generally when people see performance or RAM issues its due to a bug, not the inherent behavior of the client.
I'll make sure our native team takes a look at that! The fact your seeing all that CPU time in helpers is certainly suspicious. Thanks for the info.
I...hate...Cordova....
I would be kind of upset (actually very upset) if I paid someone to make an app and they did it with Cordova instead of natively...
Thanks. I'm actually running into another problem now. " Could not cast value of type 'Fish.MainNavigationController' (0x1047ce4a8) to 'Fish.PreviewViewController' (0x1047ce838)" I deleted my Nav controller, and then embedded the PreviewViewController UIImage into a Nav Controller. Now the app is crashing after taking a photo (It crashes before I get to the "save" button). 
Are you running it in a simulator or on an actual device. The simulator won't simulate the camera. 
They paid them a good bit and a company also bought the app for a lot of money and I saw the cached/multitasked logo and I was like wow, this guy just made a lot and did not even write it natively. I was going to ask the guy about his project and mention Swift but he would probably be very lost. lol
iOS makes it hard to get a device id for privacy reasons, but you can generate your own value and store it in the keychain. That will persist even if the app is uninstalled. [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain\_services#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP30000897-CH204-TP9](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000897-CH204-TP9)
Thanks! Were you able to segue into the Tableview (after hitting save button)? I was originally able to take a picture, segue into previewlayer which has a still of the image taken. However, I couldn't connect the save button (or the PreviewLayer) to a segue into Tableview. After embedding the PreviewViewController into a Navigation Controller (as you suggested), my PreviewController is the one crashing now (the layer before the tableView). So it was originally working, so it must be something with the embedding step. Yes, I'm running the app on an actual device. As for unwraps, I followed along some tutorials to get the camera working, so I wouldn't know all the details of why he used forced unwraps.However, I don't think at the moment there is a problem with the unwarps as it working perfectly for a couple of weeks I've been tweaking and testing. 
Confusion I have: Since my PreviewController is embeded within a Navigation Controller, does that mean my segue from first screen needs to lead to the Navigation Controller or the PreviewController? 
What type of barcode are you trying to read? Apple has some built-in solutions. If not one of those there's a bunch of readers on GitHub. Let me know and I can help you look. I have some down time this week. 
He probably would have. I have a little story regarding this topic... I was on a team once of web developers who were trying to do mobile with PhoneGap (which uses Cordova) and, I kid you not was instantly pegged by them as "not knowing mobile development" because I didn't know jQuery which the one guy said was "essential" for mobile development. (Maybe this is my experience but I've found many web developers live in a bubble and think if you don't know web languages, you don't know anything). Now, normally I'm pretty passive but these guys kept throwing me under the bus to my new boss telling her I didn't know how to code, so my second week there I spent the weekend rewriting the app they spent 3 months on in native code. It ran faster, it was a MUCH smaller code base, it didn't have any of the weird visual bugs, and it build correctly without strange random errors every time (something their app was afflicted by) and I showed my new boss and explained that I wrote it in Objective-C (Swift didn't exist yet) and showed all the benefits of coding natively. Long story short we moved forward with my native project, the team was dissolved, crapware tools like Phonegap, Xamarin, etc were banned, and I wrote the app and all future apps in native code. 
Can’t he use associated values like that?
Short answer: Firebase is not the right solution to this problem. You need a real backend with custom code where you could implement the filtering logic (and other methods). There are real security and privacy issues here. But if this is just a learning project does it even matter? What is your goal in doing this project? Will anyone else use this app? Is security and/or scaling something you should even be concerned about at this point.
Hey there 👋🏼 check out GeoFire: https://github.com/firebase/geofire-objc It’s built with objc but fully supports Swift interoperability. You can post keys to your database with whatever other data you want to store as well as the current location as values and then search through stored keys sorted by distance. Also has some other cool location-based features you might be interested in 
Invite expired?
One of the concepts in Object Oriented programming is safety. Methods that can't act on an instance, shouldn't get past the compiler. When you use more universal types like Any, you add risk. OOP is really helpful, but it takes time to really know how to use it well.
Sweet man! I just started learning swift and python, first languages ever. It sucks when you have an idea but can’t make it. How long did it take you to learn what you needed to make your first app?
Thanks for the kind words! I got similar questions in my original post in /r/iOSProgramming so I'm going to copy/paste my answer here, but if you have a follow up question or want to know something more specific, feel free to ask. \-- I have some prior experience building web apps with programming languages like php and javascript so that provided a nice knowledge foundation for me. When I finally decided that I was going to learn Swift and how to develop a native iOS app, I started with following the Swift Tutorial from the apple developer site: [Link](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1) That got me to point where I could code something and see it working on my phone. Play with the code and see how my changes affected it or what errors it produced. Then I started building out my vision for the app. From there I did a lot of googling on the specific problems I was trying to solve, a lot of reading on stack overflow, some watching of youtube videos. A lot of trial and error. Rinse and repeat on the googling, reading, and trial and error.. until I finally had something to show you guys. \-- It took me about 6 months to get from starting that tutorial to submitting the app to the store, but I would say that 80% of the functionality was completed in the first 2 months. Then it took me a bit longer to polish it, fix bugs, add "nice to have" features, refine the UX, until I thought it was ready. After I finally submitted it to the store, it took another couple weeks going back and forth between the app review team to finally get their stamp of approval. This was a bit of a slow process because it would take a few days between submissions before I got useful feedback that I could use to correct what they thought was wrong with it (some legitimate, some not).
I don't know what's more terrifying. Having a function with twenty five arguments, or needing to curry said function.
If that’s what you call code porn, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to see what you consider porn porn. 
Yeah this is the opposite of code porn. This is code hell. 
To be honest, it's more like Code BDSM. Not everyone gets it, some people just eats them up. 
This guy gets it
what about parse?
Burned how?
Why are the tests for it commented out?
I went through a dev agency that claims to vet their developers and only hire the top 3% of freelancers. When I interviewed the developer he lied about his skillset and what he was capable of. When he was developing the app, he was late on milestones and wanted to cut out features he originally said he could do. Long story short, I had the dev agency look in to the code he was delivering and they discovered that something fishy was going on so they terminated the contract.
I just read this article the other day. If you’re able to use Swift 4.1 then perhaps it will help... https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/8-conditional-coding
Unfortunately all the ones that are shown on google aren’t very helpful for me. Maybe I’m just an idiot and can’t figure it out... 
Thanks 
Yes it does help; however, it only showed me how to make one type of barcode. I would like one that can read all types (code 39, code 128, QR, etc). 
Thank you! I found some links that I’m going to follow and will contact you if I run into difficulties. I was looking into making a scanner that can read any type of barcode (QR, codabar, code 93, etc) and link it to previously stored information to retrieve some specific items. 
Thank you! 
&gt;swift and python, first languages ever Two absolutely fantastic choices. 
At the beginning I thought hired dev just has been bad at project management but from the comments it seems indeed it was shady developer. Congrats on making the app!
Could you please elaborate or give an example please if you don’t mind?
How much do you know about machine learning algorithms?
I posted one years ago that looked like a character from space invaders and it was the code for the space invaders game. They have a contest for this, most are written in C. What language is this?
That's actually one of the best "burned by a dev" stories I've heard yet. I say that because you actually had the company step up and do something about it. Did you lose any money?
yea, that's rather a slight bruise than a burn. :D
The backing company should be thanked for stepping in. There's only one "top 3%" company I know of and it's Topal. [https://www.toptal.com/](https://www.toptal.com/) There's so many stories about losing lots of money, it's nice to know there's a company out there that stops it.
I feel like being part of a marketing plot :D
Naw, I'm not with them, it's just that so many of the bad stories you get from Fiverr and others end up with never getting your money back. I've been looking for a solid company that holds devs accountable, IDK if their prices are top end or not, but I'd like to know what kind of money is made there.
&gt; What language is this? based on the sub this is in, I would say it is swift
Many of us hate Xcode. I've been using it for nearly 10 years now and it's about as bad as it I've seen it now. I have to wait so damn long for code completion that it's hardly worth it. It wasn't this bad before. I type "in" and wait for code completion and I have to go down several choice to get to Int. Xcode isn't smart enough to see that I NEVER pick anything BUT Int and I have to type 3X as much compared to NO code completion. Yea, it sucks. However, it has all the "widgets" for UI, core data, and the Sims. There's better options, but I don't think VSC would be one of them. I think it's from JetBrains. [https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/features/swift.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/features/swift.html) VSC doesn't seem very advance, I use it for Node.js/Python/etc... It works fine for code, but what about building UI and Core Data stuff?
Very cool thanks!
Xcode is such a crap software Apple has to redesign it completely... It's almost 100 years behind best IDES like intellij / Android studio
[Here you go](https://discord.gg/NgEbt6k)
Thank you! :)
Xcode has been progressing a lot lately. Faster compile times, a new text editor, the return of "refactoring". Of course you don't get a JetBrains level of REAL refactoring but it's a lot faster. Use CMD+SHIFT+F and CMD+SHIFT+O a lot, otherwise you're ignoring it's strength.
Thanks for sharing the link!
Adding up to this, Xcode 10 feels like a big improvement, I've been playing with it since the first beta. It's not JetBrains level, but it's good.
Is* Apple working on improving Apple is a company, an it, not a they. "Is it working". As a thing, Apple is an it. it is they are That's how it works in English.
Yup.
Spotted the guy who hasn’t used early versions of Xcode! Seriously it’s not the best but it’s far from the worst
Do you feel a bit better about your life having said that?
Yea, it definitely wasn't as bad as it could have been and I've heard worse stories. I was lucky that I had a technical background and was able to catch what was going on. I was also definitely salty at the time because of the time wasted, but in the end I think it worked out because I learned a new skillset and was able to make adjustments and small pivots more freely without worrying about costs.
You pay a premium. $80 - 100+ / hr.
Yes,I'm the guy you just said...I have been an Android and spring developer throughout.. Lately started with iOS from xcode 9. It's one of the worst tooling that a platform can have..
Thank you!
I thought /r/swift didn't allow app store links if the source code wasn't shared?
That’s how it works in American English but British English considers company names to be plural. 
AppCode (jetbrains) is your best bet, but it’s relatively expensive and it still links back to Xcode when required
I usually hate when people make the grammar corrections, but don’t mind it this time. “Apple are” just sounds atrocious to the ears. Like, which apple? How many apples are we talking about?
Yeah, coming from Visual Studio there’s a lot that I miss already. Don’t get me wrong, Xcode isn’t completely awful, but it definitely feels like it’s lagging behind the rest of the modern IDEs
As someone who has seen it change very little in over 5 years: No. Try AppCode.
Dude! How can you not mention those and not [this](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/)?!
It's paid and not free
Yes and a company is 'they', being a group of people. Idiot.
Do you feel better for having said that?
I think this is a difference between US English and British English. In the US, companies are considered singular nouns and it’s something tested on our college entrance exams (SAT/ACT).
👍🏼
Just lol. If you are a developer, you should know beforehand that there is no IDE that can serve you to run any language in a ver comfortable way. That said, IntelliJ is amazing for Java, same as Eclipse for using plugins for specific technologies (for example, Apache Sling) and Xcode is amazing for Swift either backend and mobile. Seriously, read again what you wrote man.
You act like American English is the only English.
Xcode most certainly is free. 
Should be amazing for being a paid product. I’m gonna try the trial version.
Code rape maybe?
Why did this get down-voted?
These downvotes... come on, for the sake of demanding progress, let’s be real. As another developer coming from Android Studio / Visual Code / Sublime, the change to xcode was, for lack of a better word, just baffling; the lack of multicursor, monochrome console font coloring, cryptic broken constraint messages (one of these bajillion constraints is broken), mysterious bugs fixable by just restarting xcode (a common joke amongst my team), the refactoring (little more than a search-and-replace, and project-wise for some reason), the lack of a true debugging evaluator (po is okay I suppose), flakey wireless debugging, But man, do I love xcode’s emulator. And swift of course, most pleasurable language I’ve worked in to date. Do try AppCode, as someone else mentioned, my coworker pays for the subscription and it looks awesome. 
Or early versions of MPW, the Classic predecessor.
OP asked specifically about "non Mac/iOS". So the storyboards is a non-issue. I've been using VSCode with swift a good bit even for iOS work as we don't use storyboard or core data. You can easily make build scripts to launch the simulators. The only extension we rely on is: https://github.com/RLovelett/vscode-swift Which actually uses source kit under the hood via a language server: https://github.com/RLovelett/langserver-swift
I would say that as a code editor it is lacking. It can do the chore but lacks the finess of a real code editor. However it is not just that. It also builds project files for you and is quite apt at interface design, something that is just unavailable in AppCode for example. People tend to forget that Xcode actually is quite a big system also due to the fact that it needs to support four similar but different operating systems and two different UI libraries. That it is not a lot more buggy than it is is actually quite a feat. 
Sorry, what does each of the commands do?
That is honestly awesome. lol
I object to your class of pun. 
Ya it’s gone from bad to good back to bad just seems to be a role of the dice when it comes to the next version I would not say it’s the worse though. But Xcode being from Apple I would have higher expectations 
Project search and find class. It's blindingly fast. Other IDE's have the same function but have this....latency....both opening the pane and searching that just doesn't exit in Xcode.
I jumped on the MacOS bandwagon with Tiger 10.4 so I missed out on MPW ;) I never was a fan of MacOS Classic
Fiverr is really the bottom of the barrel, if anyone had great skills, they wouldn't be there. I put out a job there and was flooded with bot answers. Most don't even read the job. I did the same with upwork, it's really for low end stuff.
Time is really a funny thing. I just had some people ask me about a project they said would take 3 months, now they're saying 1 month. Estimating software project is very hard.
Visual Studio is a mess. Idk how anyone could miss that. Unless you're talking about VS code.
I'm actually surprised you're asking this. It's very clearly written in Swift.
“Apple are” is correct as well. In British English this is standard. 
I've been using the playground a lot ovet the last couple of days, and I must have had to force-close and restart Xcode fifteen or more times because it's got stuck on 'Running'. The first couple of times I waited for ages, ten or more minutes, but I quickly learned that when it gets stuck, force-closing and restarting, and hence restarting the simulator fixes the problem.
From which viewcontroller are you presenting the childviewcontroller?
Interesting you mentioned intellIJ, I was a little anti java for some time, used to disagree with all the JVM idea, to me, native development was the way. I am now getting into Java and have already changed my mind in every aspect, and now about the IDE... I always said Xcode was a superior IDE, my main feud with the Java counterparts was that they had awful interface builders and as I am not used to build interfaces in any way, I am a COBOL developer, the idea of having to do such a repetitive thing with code felt wrong. But now that I used both I can only say that JetBrains focused on what matters, the code capabilities, you have shortcuts for everything, inserting stuff like constructors and so on, and now about the ‘intention actions’, when you do alt+enter on stuff, it’s insanely productive. I am a still a basic user of it but it’s so intuitive that it already blew my mind, everyone should just take notes.
I came from web and using VSC. It's not something you would want to use in place of Xcode unless you know most of the APIs by heart. The code completion/intellisense is just too useful in Xcode and not there in VSC. You can get a lot more done, faster, in VSC... but only if you really know all the syntax by heart.
I started with this route, then immediately moved to Angela Yu’s Intro to iOS development course on Udemy. Good stuff. Will probably move to HackingWithSwift next. 
It all depends on what you’re doing with it I guess. For the work I do, Visual Studio has some very useful tools and functions, but it is a mess in plenty of other areas. Xcode is very clean, but lacks so many little things I’ve come to expect from VS. VS Code is good for a free tool, but has plenty of limitations just the same, but for a free, cross-platform IDE it’s great. 
&gt;People tend to forget that Xcode actually is quite a big system also due to the fact that it needs to support four similar but different operating systems and two different UI libraries. That it is not a lot more buggy than it is is actually quite a feat. The number of OS's it supports shouldn't make it more or less buggy. The swift compiler is cross platform, like C or C++. Compare visual studio, which supports more languages and more platforms (windows, macos, android, iOS, windows phone). Granted it's buggy too, but these OSes are much less similar. 
No. They're repurposing their entire software development to a new feature called drivemoji's that drives a car by facial expressions. It will only work in cars that have carplay. Apple is absolute shit now.
Not really free if you are REQUIRED to own Apple hardware to use it. 
By that logic, no software has ever been, or ever can be free.
I came from Visual Studio + ReSharper which is even superior to JetBrains own offerings in term of functionality as well as "Interface Builders". But there's a certain sluggishness to both IntelliJ and VS that Xcode doesn't have. Sure I miss being able to factor out functions on the fly reliably, extract Interfaces and so on.
Xcode also supports other languages but that is not the point. The chance that there are bugs in code increases with size. Visual Studio supports multiple operating systems? Yeah. If you want to drink the .Net Koolaid. Not to mention the fact that VS is slow as molasses and continually tries to pull you into the Microsoft environment. 
Google: “swift outline UIView”
Look at the header for `CALayer`, there are properties for border colour and width.
let object.layer.borderColor = .red
This is the Voynich Document written in Swift.
Yes.
&gt; object.layer.bordrWidth object.layer.bord**e**rWidth*
Android studio is free too...it is almost a century better than xcode 
Did you just create an account to troll Apple sub.?
Good catch. !redditsilver
You can scroll if you have a table view. If you don’t, just change the vc size to “free form” in the identity inspector
Well played.
It's decent and will be very familiar if you've used IntelliJ or Android Studio. Otherwise it will take some getting used to. You'll still need Xcode, but if I'm writing a lot of new code I prefer the experience in AppCode. Plus it doesn't handle editor tabs idiotically.
Absolutely nothing but please explain however you can so I can do some research. 
THANK YOU!
Not just classes but also files, functions, properties, etc.
I worked on an old Objective-C project I created years ago and the Xcode experience with an Objective-C project is so much better. It seems to auto-complete almost instantly and compiles way faster. I wonder how much of XCode's problems are related to Swift being relatively new?
updated the post. 
Weird. It almost seems like iOS is using the unscaled resolution of the screen. Is this also occurring on devices that do not have hardware scaling? Like iPad, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 (but not plus), iPhone 7 (but not plus) etc.
I am running it on iPhone 5s
I was wondering how does the design part works as Xcode does? When writing code I find the IntelliJ experience to be satisfactory.
Thanks!
Hi plurp911! Unfortunately, the link to the App Store you submitted has been automatically removed from /r/Swift. This is because – generally speaking – compiled products are not relevant to /r/Swift (even if the app was originally written in Swift). If this is an app you have written, congrats on your acceptance to the App Store! A great way to promote it would be [Reddit advertising](https://www.reddit.com/advertising). If you would like to release its Swift source code, we would gladly accept a link to that. If the content you were submitting *was* in fact related to the subject of Swift programming, please [message the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswift&amp;subject=Please%20review%20my%20removed%20App%20Store%20submission&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/92hb0i/created_puzzle_game_in_swift_from_scratch/) to have it reviewed.

Was hoping to get feedback on the application itself mostly...
Thanks, I’ll take a look and give a review when I get a chance. 
If you mean Interface Builder you have to use Xcode for that. Honestly it's not an ideal situation but sometimes Xcode as an editor is just so bad
Like all new keyboards, there’s an adjustment period. Once you get there, it’s great. 
Xcode is an IDE for Swift and it does work offline - what are you referring to?
You should see a "+" and "-" near the bottom and you can use that to zoom in/out. Otherwise, scroll mouse works. There's a small button at the lower left of the story board screen that opens an object browser. You can see all your views there and when you highlight one, it show up in the other window. This makes it easier to find things as they get complex.
Why start from scratch my friend? This accomplishes everything I need for my social media app. Video and all. Flash, Front/Back Camera, Zoom.. Lightning adjusted. https://github.com/Awalz/SwiftyCam
Controversial opinion I’m sure but I kinda miss (I think it was Xcode 6) where the view controllers in storyboards defaulted to a more square shape. It made you think more about your constraints and size classes and what’s going on when the views are laid out instead of what they’ll look like on the phone. 
Setup your scroll view with 0/0/0/0 constraints, then set the height. Then place another view inside also with 0/0/0/0 constraints. You’ll see blue lines pop up on the right side, click those and set priority to lowest. After that ensure that vertical alignment for all elements are set from top to bottom against each other. This enables you to scroll up and down on your simulator/phone.
sometimes I dont have my mac on me and i want to code a little bit
Well, knowing that, I think I will give the AppCode a try for Vapor since the Interface builder is not needed at all. The bummer is that costs 200 bucks, it’s a bit expensive compared to other software products.
Ahh, well this is a Swift subreddit. It's about the code really.
As a former iOS engineer who know does system level stuff - I would give my left leg to have a development environment 1/10th as seamless as Xcode. 
The horror.
I am running it on iPhone 5s
Xcode is one of main product of Apple. Every single AppStore developers practically need to use it. So, of course Apple is working on improving Xcode. Otherwise, how will it support the developers? However, whether the work is good enough or not is another discussion. :)
I think they want an IDE that runs on the iPad/iPhone
sometimes I dont have my mac on me and i want to code a little bit
What's the app you're talking about? You need a compiler, and that's not available on iOS. Surely this "app" needs access to a remote server to compile Swift, and show you the results. So, no local compiler means you need online access. 
It’s called “Sedona”, I didn’t know that a swift IDE need an online compiler
XCode is under development and always will be!!!!!! Note Swift is a compiler XCode is an IDE. Swift has similar issues in that it is under rapid development. What does this all mean? Simple things will get better and their will be regressions. Apple is all in with respect to Swift so you can expect that Swift the language and Swift the compiler will improve every year until it is stable. After stability is hit expect yearly refinement.
Look up Charts on GitHub. There’s a few different cocoa pods that should give you what you need
On IPad it does mainly because of Apple stupidity with respect to what apps can do with processes. Ultimately an app like Sedona might be able to implement a swift compiler as a thread but I'm not sure IOS devices of thsi generation have the resources to do that well. Strike that; I just remembered Playgrounds which is effectively an example of what an IDE could do on iOS. Baring some other infraction of Apples regulations I don't see why an IDE with a built in compiler couildn't work on iPad. All it would take si for somebody to write it. Personally I don't see such a tool as being very useful on iPad until Apple stabilizes the ABI and includes .so's with an iOS release.
While I slated Xcode's development above, the visual editor is the one part of it Apple got right; really right - I'd say it's the best integrated UI editor I've ever seen. As u/tylerjames says; AppCode doesn't attempt to match this (they tried once but that's another story) and so you should use Xcode for the UI editing and AppCode for the code editing. This may sound awkward but given how both Xcode and AppCode sync so seamlessly from changes made to the project in the filesystem, it's actually a surprisingly comfortable workflow to just tab between Xcode and AppCode as the UI and code editors. As for the price? If you're just an iOS hobbyist the cost may not be worth it, but if you're doing iOS Development professionally, after a week or two of earnest use it'll seem like a no-brainer.
Hey buddy, good night! Are you using a secure IPV6 connection that complies with apple and facebook restrictions? Your fb developer account is properly set and registered? I had a similar issue for not using the correct environment. Then I had to change some values on the app configs. 
We could talk through pm and I could send you my swift2 code that used facebook api, how does it sound? Today it would not be possible, but tomorrow is fine!
Charts seems to be the standard. IIRC, it comes with all the code, so you can modify as you need.
Thanks! I guess I will probably end up using something like this for my project, but now that I'm in so far, I want to get the flash working. 
Try this: http://dringend.cc
Looks like a customized UIPickerView
THANK YOU!
I’m a software dev with 31 years under my belt and been exclusively iOS since 2010 (when interface builder was a separate app) I’ve worked with hundreds of iOS developers, most of them using dark themes but the consensus is that only 10 to 20 percent actually like appcoda. And usually these guys come from web technologies. I’ve heard the pros so many times refactoring is better is the most popular. My question is how much refactoring do you actually do? and if it’s a lot then maybe your coding level is basic and needs improving. I find Xcode pleasing to work in day in day out it feels very Apple esque where as AppCode looks like you paid a lot of money for Eclipse. There are annoyances though. Playgrounds auto run needs to be switched off to make it usable but if you map ctrl + r to execute it works nicely. Apple are always working on improving Xcode, that’s a given. The question is the definition of improvement itself. More like a Java based IDE for writing Java derived code? Never going to happen but to some this is their idea of improvement. 
Fucking props to you man! I had to make a production ready app using React Native for a CS class, and let me tell you: I'd rather use Cordova. At least with Cordova you can use HTML and CSS, which are well documented. React is poorly documented and riddled with bugs, it's a hot mess. Made me appreciate my background in Swift programming so much more. &lt;/rant&gt;
Looks interesting, but 11months without an update makes me hesitate to purchase. 
if isEndless == true {} ‘== true’ is redundant. You should use if isEndless {} (and for false: if !isEndless {} )
&gt; That’s how it works in American English but ~~British~~ English considers company names to be plural. TFTFY

Out of interest, why are you not just using autolayout?
why not Unity?
To smooth the line you have to use spline interpolation. Either hermite or catsmul-rom. First is easier to code, second looks better. 
Unless you are planning to use 3rd party c++ libraries go with full swift.
Somewhat experienced is not well defined tho. Please leave more info 
They were also not working so i thought doing it programmatically 
vC2 is not covering the entire screen because it's frame was not set to do so and/or scrollView does not cover the entire view. You added vC2.view as a subview of scrollView. So vC2.view.frame is being expressed in scrollView's coordinate system. If you're trying to achieve the effect of swiping left and having vC2 cover the screen, make sure you set scrollView.frame = view.bounds, then: 1. Set scrollView.contentSize = CGSize(width: 2 * view.bounds.size.width, height: view.bounds.size.height) 2. Set vC2.frame = scrollView.bounds and then 3. vC2.frame.origin.x = scrollView.bounds.maxX 4. scrollView.addSubview(vC2.view)
ObjC can interop more easily with C++ and a lot of game dev stuff is in C++.
Is this your first language? Swift is relatively straightforward if you come from something like Java or C#. It’s good to check out all the features and see how the pros use them for how to use stuff like optional chaining well.
I know C, C++, and Java a bit.
I started working on OS X and not iOS. I found initially it was hard to figure out how to do certain things because most guides are for iOS and they are different enough that it wouldn't work for OS X. That being said I used every resource I could find and I found I was learning why you need to do it a certain way not just how you need to do it. tldr: what I that was a bane to learning became a boon
Swift is my first language and I’ve been developing with it for two years. 
Maybe I don't understand your question but you can do: switch photoSetting.flashMode { case .on: print("on") case .off: print("off") case .auto: print("auto") } To check the current flash mode on an AVCapturePhotoSettings instance.
it worked thanks
One book that really helped me get past the "intermediate" level was [Advanced Swift](https://gumroad.com/l/advanced-swift). It goes into quite a bit of detail on really useful topics that YT and Udemy courses seems to skip over in favor of quick results. When it comes to CS concepts, I only really needed them for interviews. So I used [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). It helped me focus on the concepts I needed to get hired (which is really all I cared about). If you're looking for something more, I'd recommend edX's [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures) course. I'm not sure if their certificates are worth anything in the real world, but the content definitely has value. Good luck on your continued learning!
I did exactly that a few months ago at work. Charts is a good solution, but we're not allowed to use 3rd party libraries due to security issues. If you're in the same situation, here's a quick breakdown of what I did. First plot your CGPoints and get them to show up where you need them. Once you've done that, just refactor your code to create a UIBezierPath using those same calculations while setting the control xPos halfway (or near that) between the points and set the yPos equal to its CGPoint's yPos. That creates a smooth curve from one point to the next. I'm sorry I can't post the code here since the company owns it, but hopefully this will get you going in the right direction.
Started learning in December. Now I own a custom data transmission protocol. It’s a great language. I should’ve learned years ago when it was released, was just too young to know about it. 
The weakest part of using Swift, in my mind, is the help files. Visual Studio always gives you code snippets on how to use whatever it is your looking for. Apple, it seems, still has an attitude that nothing should come from outside the company. I think their documentation sucks on purpose.
Probably i can help. I need more details
Hey buddy, I am interested and an experienced iOS developer. Please let me know more about it. 
You're welcome :)
Stanford’s CS193p course, which is free on YouTube, paired with the assignments on the corresponding Google Drive were super helpful imo
Google CS50. I’m about to start that after finish intro the app development 
There's obviously quite a bit of code in there so I'm not going to go over it all with a fine-toothed comb. It looks pretty good but you have quite a bit of repeated code that can be refactored. For example, in GameController.swift you can trim `paymentQueue(_:updatedTransactions:)` down to: private func buyCoins(_ amount:Int) { coins += amount coinsLabel.text = "\(coins) ❂" let coinsDefault = UserDefaults.standard coinsDefault.setValue(coins, forKey: "coins") coinsDefault.synchronize() } func paymentQueue(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, updatedTransactions transactions: [SKPaymentTransaction]) { for transaction:AnyObject in transactions { if let trans = transaction as? SKPaymentTransaction { switch trans.transactionState { case .purchased: SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction as! SKPaymentTransaction) switch productID { case REMOVEADS_PRODUCT_ID: removeAdsButton.isHidden = true didRemoveAds = true let didRemoveAdsDefault = UserDefaults.standard didRemoveAdsDefault.setValue(didRemoveAds, forKey: "didRemoveAds") didRemoveAdsDefault.synchronize() case TIER1_PRODUCT_ID: buyCoins(buyTier1Coins) case TIER2_PRODUCT_ID: buyCoins(buyTier2Coins) case TIER3_PRODUCT_ID: buyCoins(buyTier3Coins) case TIER4_PRODUCT_ID: buyCoins(buyTier4Coins) default: break } case .failed: SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction as! SKPaymentTransaction) break case .restored: SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction as! SKPaymentTransaction) break default: break } } } } Just taking the repeated code and putting it into a method cuts down your code considerably and makes it so that you reduce your chances of having a bug in one of the cases. You notice I also took out the `if..else if..` construct and replaced it with a `switch` statement. The other major thing I see is you have a ton of code that sets up various UI elements. It might be best to simply serialize out the settings into a file and read them in when you need them. You'll trim your code quite a bit and have less complexity, in addition you can easily modify your game just by changing the data files. This means you can provide content more easily. For example with a simple change of data files you can re-skin the game, change languages, modify levels, fix bugs, and so on. One other quick thing I noticed, you're using some force unwraps in your code. Those are bad because they can create runtime crashes in unexpected places. Most of them are easily removed: lazy var quitButton: UIButton = { let button = UIButton(type: .system) button.backgroundColor = UIColor1 button.setTitle("QUIT", for: .normal) button.setTitleColor(UIColor2, for: .normal) button.titleLabel?.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 20) button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false button.titleLabel!.textAlignment = .center button.titleLabel!.numberOfLines = 1 button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleQuit), for: .touchUpInside) button.isHidden = true return button }() Safer: lazy var quitButton: UIButton = { let button = UIButton(type: .system) button.backgroundColor = UIColor1 button.setTitle("QUIT", for: .normal) button.setTitleColor(UIColor2, for: .normal) button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleQuit), for: .touchUpInside) button.isHidden = true translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false if let titleLabel = button.titleLabel { titleLabel.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 20) titleLabel.textAlignment = .center titleLabel.numberOfLines = 1 } return button }() Even if the chance of a crash is very small it's still worth it to remove the force unwraps. They're a bad pattern to follow and it often takes so little to remove.
I written C, C++, java, python, and lua, professionally for over 20 years -- all this before I picked up Swift so I'm not sure my experience will be useful to you, but I prefer Swift over all those other languages (although python is a close 2nd). If you want to write for iOS or MacOS there's really no other choice (well, objective c, but at this stage unless you have to use it it's just better to not). So the question should be: what is your target OS? (Python and some others are pretty platform-agnostic, so depending on how much you are interested in GU?I that's a factor too). 
I used to develop on a 2-cores cpu 2013 13” macbook pro and was fine. In my case it became really slow though when I started using it with an external display, but hopefully yours should be fine anyway.
Not slow at all for most projects. Honestly, any slowness will mostly be due to bugs in Xcode or the tools and it will happen on nearly any machine. The only real reason to have a very fast computer is you have a massive codebase, for most apps you can use a machine even 8 or 9 years old without a problem. I develop on a 2010 MacBook Pro and a 2012 iMac without any issues.
Is there support for Unicode’s Roman numerals ([https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/Roman-numerals/](https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/Roman-numerals/))? Ⅺ might not be recognized as XI.
Reading Cracking the Coding Interview made me feel like I had an CS interview cheatsheet. 
You sure can, I’m still using my 2012 MBP daily, it’s still going strong. [Here’s a benchmark you might find useful.](https://github.com/ashfurrow/xcode-hardware-performance/blob/master/Readme.md)

I guess that's how I would class myself. I am relatively experienced programmer in terms of years (18+) but just not that experienced with swift. 
Agreed. There’s a good ones specifically for Swift called [iOS Interview Guide](https://iosinterviewguide.com) by a developer at Reddit named Alex Bush. This one also helped a lot. 
yeah me too :( got a first gen rMBP, still works too well. Considering buying a new one, but looking at apple.com right now 15" mbp is 2800 Eur at lowest specs, so more like ~3500 after customization &amp; usb adapters &amp; whatnot. Way too much money for the luxury of having a better CPU.

I’ve noticed that, throughout my life, anyone who says “lets take this into pms” on the first message, or “i can do this with you tomorrow,” have been the least helpful people i’ve ever interacted with. They have tried to sell me stuff, tried to ask me unrelated questions. So many things that just ruin my experience in my attempt to solve a problem. I don’t know if this is you, Origami, but it it is not, i recommend you use different phrasing that doesn’t sound like you are going to fuck with them. 
Yeah, I know the feeling. I'm considering the 2018s as well, but I can't seem to justify that much money for basically the better CPU. I'll probably use this one until it breaks in some way, since they don't even repair them at Apple anymore.
Nah, I got no intention to sell stuff. I just wanna send the source code. I dont know if reddit supports it so I would send through mail or such. 
The “tomorrow” stuff was because at that time I was ready to sleep. In Brazil it was late night. 
OOO - thanks should of thought of that! Version 0.2 on it's way!
Yes!. This works.However, I can't seem to figure out how to switch flashMode. I had tried something like this: ` let x= AVCapturePhotoSettings.flashMode.on' switch x{ case .auto ...... } print(x) I was getting the error: t "Enum element "auto" cannot be referenced as an instance member` 
My choice. Proved and tested. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swift
Although I didn’t get the main objective, the game looks pretty good and well made (maybe an initial tutorial could help beginners like me). I only have a few questions for you: 1) Did you use SpriteKit for this game? 2) How did you manage the tiles? Are they simple views arranged by AutoLayout? 3) Which library did you use to put ads into your app? Thanks in advance.
Just assign the new value. For example, the default value for `flashMode` is `.off`. To set it to on, just do `photoSetting.flashMode = .on` 
Depending on the game, you might find a lib written in one or the other. Example: if you wanted a blackjack game, you might look for a base game that's already done and open source. It might be written in only one or the other.
Thanks. I will try again. If I remember correctly, changing it directly has having no effect. I was able to get it working with a enum, switch, case, and a custom function, but it's a little complicated for me. So I will test out your method again once I finish up a couple of things. Thank you =)
Thanks for checking it out! 1) Nope, didn't use any libraries 2.) Yep, all the tiles are just a views/buttons 3.) I decided to use AdMob
Wow! Thank you so much for looking everything over, all of this helps very much!
I use a late 2015 MBA and it’s fine for Xcode and learning swift. Only gripe with it is the small SSD (128GB) but if you only install the essentials like Xcode, pages, numbers etc and keep your music and photos on an external SSD you’ll be OK
$130, nothx 
No problem. Like I said, the code looked pretty good other than the verbosity. If you can get in a habit of reuse of code you’ll find your projects are a lot easier to work with. 
They always put a high price so they can put a 90% reduction on it. Udemy's marketing vision is weird. 
That teaser video is too much lol

Do you want it to stop updating? If so, why?
Perhaps it's best if you make a minimum example and then show some code.
It sounds like either there is a flaw in your logic or something is not being refreshed that should. You’re going to have to post the code for that viewController if you want any really help. 
Pretty much all the active languages update. Swift is updating faster now because it's a very young language, as it matures it will probably become more stable.
It’s a pain in the ass right now due to ABI instability. But it should be fine with Swift 5 because they’re finally decided to (concentrate on binary interfaces)[https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABIStabilityManifesto.md]. So all future updates after version 5 should be more less painful. On the other hand, Swift is very young language and all recent changes are more than welcome. I personally appreciated them and will love new languages features even more after ABI stability goal.

The Swift compiler does not guarantee 100% correct execution order regarding multithreading. So if you have to work with locks and semaphores, you might be better off with Obj-C. Just a caveat to be aware of. This might be interesting if you plan to use AudioUnits.
is `imageDirectory` an Optional type? 
appendingPathComponent does not return an Optional. You don't need `if let...` just use `let`.
Should be .first?... That will make it optional. 
Some of these are repeats of the others. I bought a few last year and there was a lot of overlap. Look at the subjects for each lesson and see what you need. I wish there were more specialized one that don't repeat what others have already done. Cookbooks are cool, but going deep with things like networking, core data, RESTful, GCD... and making a larger project seems to be more real world.
Dude. Fortran and COBOL still update every now and again.
Even python updates and it’s pretty old. Here’s a better question though: which languages have stopped getting updates after the four year mark? Answer: languages that died before becoming four years old.
Well , Conan the barbarian is the teacher, so...
How would I check if the full path exists or not though? That's what I was trying to do 
I think it's something like: let path = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent(directory!, isDirectory: true).path if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) { ... } though you could do something like: extension FileManager { func documentsFileExists(at path: String, dir: Bool) -&gt; Bool { guard let path = urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first else { return false } return fileExists(atPath: path.appendingPathComponent(path, isDirectory: dir).path) } } Then do: FileManager.default.documentsFileExists(at: directory!)
This is a cool idea and a great way to learn about swift. Nice job!
I am.
"Quick fixes"?? There are no good quick fixes in software development - there's knowledge, experience, design, and hard work. If you need a "quick fix" for your iOS project then you should probably go back and learn how to do it right instead of putting a bandaid on it.
I've learn many programming languages during my career as a programmer. My main programming language is (object) [Pascal](https://pak.lebah.web.id/pascal5.html). I'm now studying Swift as a hobby since I'm no longer a professional programmer. Learning a programming language, any kind of programming language, or programming in general, is **not** easy. But it's **not** hard either. I believe everybody is capable to be a good programmer. It's all depend on how well you comprehend logic and data structure. However, the hardest part of programming is not the syntax (the rule of the language), but the implementation of the language into a real application. Once you know the syntax of a language, learning another language would be quite fast and easy. But the way you build an application in one language is quite different when you switch to another language. Building a real application requires you to also understand how to utilize the RTL (runtime library) and common SDK (software development kit) that come along with the language. Every programming language has its own pack of RTL and SDKs with their own rules of usage that sometimes are more complex than the language itself. Learning them is the real problem. 😊 
excellent 
Just quit a job where the other “senior” dev always wanted the ‘quick fix’. The code produced by dev was/is full of code smells , spaghetti code and un-readable. The problem is/was he speaks managment language. So they love that dev. So glad I’m no longer working there. 
There are a few steps. First, you want to create a UIButton. Then you want to add the button to your subView. Finally, you'll want to create a method for when it's pressed. Here's a basic example to get you started. This code should be in a method and called on your other button press. //Create the button let newButton = UIButton() //Create the button's dimension. newButton.frame = CGRect(origin: CGPoint(x: 100.0, y: 100.0), size: CGSize(width: 100.0, height: 30.0)) //Set some basic properties newButton.backgroundColor = .black newButton.setTitleColor(.white, for: .normal) newButton.setTitle("Press me", for: .normal) //Create the target action newButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonPressed(_:)), for: .touchUpInside) //Add to subview. self.view.addSubview(newButton) This will be outside your method. //The method called when the button is pressed @objc func buttonPressed(_ sender: UIButton) { print(" Button Pressed") } 
link to the google drive? 
What's in the 'Hacking with Swift Frequent Flyer Club' section? It would be a complete dick-move if they're just ripped-off someone else's content that users would otherwise pay for (the Hacking with Swift Frequent Flyer club includes content that is available to people that buy books from the author). I'm sure that stuff's available illegally anyway, but adding it to your own course and selling it? If that's what this is, then this Udemy course really is garbage.
You should instead create it ahead of time along with all your other UI, whether that’s in code or storyboard etc, and hide it before the view appears. Then simply unhide it when the desired event happens.
well, it was pretty easy. the language has relatively few surprises and you can write "primitive" swift pretty quick after a few days. but then again I worked for 15 years as a C++ and Obj-C developer before so for a beginner it might be different
yes, you can. my office machine is a 15" 2013 MBP. just don't try use a MacBook (the small machines without a fan) to run Xcode lol.
You mean macbook air? Ive been using xcode on it for a while. No issue so far
No, not the air. These ones: https://www.apple.com/macbook/ The Air is fine for development. Had one myself and I wish Apple would update the model line because the small MacBooks are just not powerful enough for Xcode. (And my desire to have another MBP just for working at home is minimal).
Opinions about MVC are like a-holes. Everyone has one ;)
How're you doing it now? inserting on click? 
looking very nice. going to suggest to my friends and colleagues
Yes, inserting on click, but getting the rowIndex to correspond to the correct city/country is difficult.
[swift.org](https://swift.org) and apple documentation is the best resource.i hope so but there are some more such as [rewenderlich.com](https://rewenderlich.com) and [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) and [Udemy.com](https://Udemy.com) also.
This is more Udemy spam – /u/lyinsteve, please do your thing!
I've reported this as spam, because that's what it is. However, for your reference: I'm the author of Hacking with Swift, and the chap behind this course is the only person who has my approval to produce my content in video form – including the Frequent Flyer content.
I think it needs a way to indicate that a row has sub rows, and also something to show that it is open/closed.

Thanks!
This is a great App idea. Looking forward to it's release.
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1-TWZDChwwzkiGzt78QlPZDzN-j82JfR6) That has the lecture slides and assignments. If you follow the course uploaded by Michael Deiman on YouTube, the About sections of each video include other good links and tell you when to do what assignments
Is CS50 app devdlopment? I thought it was general compsci
You will need to share the declaration of your ContentClass.Section But that error usually means you are trying to assign a value where either side is optional and is not being handled as such. You could always try something like: if let section = ContentClass.Section { LabelOne.text = “Section: \(section)” }
all of the variables are Integers. unfortunately when i do that i get the error: Initializer for conditional binding must have Optional type, not 'Int'
That suggests that the label hasn’t been instantiated then. Which would mean the text property of the label is nil. If let labelOne = LabelOne { labelOne.text = “Section: \(ContentClass.Section)” }
The original text would have been "Section: 1" Unfortunately this doesn't update the text on the label
Because it seems that your label is nil, which is why you are having the crash. If you log the label, you will see that it will output something like &lt;Optional&gt; { nil } So your label hasn’t been created at that time.
Years. There's always something new to learn, some new trick or way of doing things. In programming if you ever stop learning you're left behind.
Label has been created, it is then in a slide out menu(second controller) that it is changed.
It’s not staying around, otherwise you wouldn’t be having this issue. Your original error shows that you are trying to unwrap a nil object. We have determined that to be the label itself, especially as the text is not updated when doing a conditional binding of the label. With the limited code you have provided I can not give you a definitive answer. Just that is looks like your label is nil.
Where do you set LabelOne? Is it in the view controller initializer or do the storyboard handle that? I guess that you have something like this in your code `var LabelOne: UILabel!` If that is true it is probably not set when you call select.
Well, it mostly depends on how many hours a day you spend, if you have any previous experience with programming, how easily tought you are. If you mean, how long it will take to be able to work as a Swift developer? Then the answer is above. I know people whom have been hired as developers within half a year of learning to code, for others, it's taken 3-4 years. You can never know everything in programming as there's always more to learn or more effective ways to code. Just practice, grind, cry a little, grind some more and have fun!
Use different colors for the drop down items and for the toggler, open and close list when clicked. Looks great so far!
I was trying to do this exact thing, this is how I solved it, https://github.com/jay18001/SwiftUtilities/blob/master/SwiftUtilities/StringExtensions.swift
[Permanent](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/#press-y-to-permalink-to-a-file-in-a-specific-commit) GitHub links: * [jay18001/SwiftUtilities/.../**StringExtensions.swift** (master → db742cb)](https://github.com/jay18001/SwiftUtilities/blob/db742cbec4eccc7f845a3922462940c849f850a0/SwiftUtilities/StringExtensions.swift) ---- [^delete](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=GitHubPermalinkBot&amp;subject=deletion&amp;message=Delete reply e38ugo2.)
in the ViewController it's set as @IBOutlet weak var LabelOne: UILabel! then in the viewDidLoad LabelOne = "Section:\(ViewController.section)" LabelOne = UIFont(name: ContentClass.Font, size: 15) LabelOne.textColor = .black LabelOne.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false LabelOne.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leftAnchor).isActive = true LabelOne.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.topAnchor).isActive = true
Wow, this is one hell of a complete example. Kudos!
&gt;LabelOne = "Section:\(ViewController.section)" I don’t think that’s doing what you want it to do, which would be: LabelOne.text = "Section:\(ViewController.section)"
Sorry that’s actually just a typo in my reply rather than the program itself
Thanks so much for answering me! The app ran smoothly in my iPhone 6S Plus and I didn’t find any bugs or things going in an unexpected way. Congrats man! You did a great work with it! How long did you take to finish it up?
A little side note: Swift doesn’t actually have any built in regular expression support. What you’re using is NSRegularExpression, which is part of Foundation. Foundation is an Apple framework written in Objective-C. Swift can however seamlessly interop with ObjC and C libraries and frameworks, and importing Foundation allows you to access its types and functions from a Swift program. If the documentation is lacking, you should blame Foundation, not Swift. Or, you could blame Swift for not natively supporting regex in its standard library, I guess. 
hey underscore_at, Thanks for the suggestion. That was a lot of fun. Added support for Roman Unicode characters. added: **New:** A default to select if the returned strings are in normal alpha characters or in Roman Unicode: public static var defaultUseRomanUnicodeChars: Bool **New:** An enumeration for Text Case. public enum TextCase: String { case Upper, Lower } **Updated:** description to return either alpha characters or the extended Roman unicode characters based on default selections. public var description: String **Updated:** The property asRomanString is always returned as an alpha string. public var asRomanString **New:** The property asRomanUnicodeChars is aways returned as RomanUnicode. public asRomanUnicodeChars: string **Updated:** Added support for Roman Unicode characters for input from string literals, etc. Added the ability to override the default case. public static func convertToRoman(_ value: Int, useRomanUnicode: Bool = defaultUseRomanUnicodeChars, textCase: TextCase = defaultCase ) -&gt; String **New:** Added Unit test for Roman Unicode support. func testRomanUnicodeCharacterSupport() **Updated:** Updated the conversion unit test to include Roman Unicode testing. func testConversion() 
It doesn't stop, really. If you have a certain goal, you can learn just enough to get to that goal. If you want to be a programmer, you won't ever stop learning. APIs, languages, platform changes... it never stops.
Thanks!
Leaning Swift (the Language) is actually the smallest part. If, for example, you're aiming to develop iOS apps, you will need to learn a whole lot of concepts and frameworks that have nothing to do with Swift, and everything to do with the platform, like UIKit, CoreData, Networking, UserNotifications and many many many more. As others have said, that can take years until you're really proficient.
I just want to learn enough to make a simple but decent app
Do you have a source with more info about this? Would like to learn more.
Your code could definitely be more readable. Fix it up man, if you want prople to help you.
Thanks for the kudos! 
Sorry, I copied + pasted from another text editor, and didn't realize the format got all messed up. 
Then not years. Use storyboard to your advantage and tutorials tutorials tutorials. Ray wenderlich ones are great. BUT theres a catch. Do NOT make something generic. Simplicity usually leads to generic but it doesn’t have to. Find some sort of ridiculous niche that relates to one of your passions and then make something that doesn’t exist at all. Then it can be simple and successful. Making the app is half the battle and then getting it out there is the other half. 
I was planning on making a tic tac toe a00, mainly because nearly all of them are “glow”, “lite and pro”, and I even found a basketball one. Too generic?
Learning software development is like learning chess. You can learn it in 20 minutes but it takes a lifetime to master. Many of us will never truly be masters but those who are have spent a lifetime becoming so.
Honestly, it’s kind of annoying seeing you keep asking the same questions about the same problem when I gave you a solution. I follow a Twitter account that automatically tweets posts here. You’ve been on my timeline way too many times with this. The answer is in the Github project I reference on your first question. Even if you just use it, looking at the code is helpful. When people TRY to help you, at least consider the resources you’re given. 
Yea probably. But its still a great learning exercise. Plus if you can put some quirky spin on it that relates to a niche community then you can probably make it work. 
Thanks 4 advice!
No problem, glad you enjoyed it! Not sure how long it took exactly, but maybe total a month or two but working off and on, several hours a week.
I did look over the code you gave me. I spent an hour WITH a friend going over the code, to see if we can solve the camera problems. You are making assumptions that I didn't look at the code. You are throwing a huge github opensource project at a beginner, with tons of features and variables which all seem to be connected in a complicated manner and seem to be expecting that to be the be all end all solution to all AVFoundation related questions. Just because you can parse huge projects and solve all of your problems via this method, please don't make those assumptions about others. "you keep asking the same questions about the same problem when I gave you a solution" I'm not asking the same questions. This question has nothing to do with my other question regarding tutorials/resource on how to implement the thumbnail. This is a VERY specific question I'm asking based on what I read in the documentation, stackoverflow and an answer someone suggested in a another thread on reddit regarding the camera flashmode. Just because I'm asking camera related questions please don't assume all questions are the same. The github you gave me didn't even use photoSettings for flash mode ( from what I could parse as a beginner), and instead used `lock for configuration` and captureDevice which have been deprecated since ios10 according and not the preferred way in Swift 4. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings/1648760-flashmode If my posts are bothering you that much just ignore my questions, or if possible block me. If the board is active my questions will move on to the next page. From my limited time here I see people asking the same questions over and over, for resources geared towards beginners, but those questions don't seem to get any flack nor does it bother me. Just ignore my posts. I do acknowledge that I've been asking a lot of questions, but as far I know this reddit is also beginner friendly. I don't see any "learnSwift" as there is a "LearnPython" 
Thanks, I just tried this but it doesn't seem to be working: https://old.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/92xnms/camera_flashmode_not_turning_on_despite_setting/ 
You will want to round (or truncate) before printing it out. [Here's Apples documentation on the round() function](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double/2884722-round) 
Use [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) import Foundation if(segCurrency.selectedSegmentIndex == 0){ let dollar = NSNumber(value: peso / 18.62) var formatter = NumberFormatter() formatter.numberStyle = .currency formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "en_US") formatter.maximumFractionDigits = 2 formatter.minimumFractionDigits = 2 lblMoney.text = formatter.string(from: dollar) }
I would definitely say learn Swift over Objective-C right now. I recommend watching some free youtube tutorials and following along with them. That’s how I started to learn Swift &amp; XCode.
Rounding will give you an integer value. Even if you use the trick to multiply by 100, round to integer, then divide by 100 you aren't assured of getting a value that's perfectly representable as a decimal unless you also use [`Decimal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/decimal).
Really appreciate your response. Should I learn XCode as well? Both at once or do you recommend learning one over the other to begin?
Nope.
I would learn them at the same time
I am currently learning swift through a combination of Apple’s free eBook App Development with Swift, Let’s Build That App on YouTube and Ray Wenderlich. Give those a try and you will be off to a great start. 
Awesome! Great job man! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thank you very much, I will check all of those out. How long have you been learning Swift and have you been able to program anything you are excited about or proud of yet? 
String(format: “$%.02f”, decimal) should format the string the way you want it.
No worries mate! I have been learning for about 6 months, doing a part time course that is run by one of the universities in Australia. It’s based off the Apple eBook which is awesome. I have built a number of small apps for assignments and tutorials like guessing games etc but I am gearing up for my big final assignment now. The eBook is perfect for getting the basics and the best practices. When you get more comfortable, Let’s Build That App has great tutorials on recreating popular apps like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube from a guy that has worked at big companies and will teach you how to build your user interfaces completely in code which is a god skill to have. I am at the point now where I feel I can start working on my own ideas and end up with something decent! 
Solved! This was the easiest answer for me to use. Thank you!
Congrats and good luck on your final assignment! That must be so exciting to feel comfortable enough to work on our own ideas. Im stoked to start delving into it all! 
This solution is simple but it won't do stuff like locale-specific decimal separators, thousands separators, currency symbols, negative values, and so on. You can certainly handle all of those yourself but it's easier and more proper to use the formatter that's built-in to Foundation: [NumberFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter)
Xcode is the IDE where the language, Swift, is written. 
Thank you for clarifying that. Definitely good to know!
I know you don’t want to waist time, but do be patient with yourself. This is a skill, and skills take time. Anyway, I would checkout the Stanford online iOS classes. Developing iOS 10 apps with swift on iTunesU were great for me (I used them years ago when everything was ObjectiveC)
Thanks for the tips, I’m definitely gonna try to take it easy and enjoy the process instead of rushing it. With everything changing so much I’m sure it’ll take constant learning to stay up to date. Thanks for the course suggestions, I’ll look into them for sure 
The first part, of really learning to program, to think about execution patterns, that doesn’t change. We just morph that thinking from pattern to pattern. That part stays, it doesn’t change. Ui frameworks change, language change, storage changes, but not how we think about solving problems with a computer. That is also the hard part that takes the most time. I started programming at 10, I really started understanding what I was doing at 30. Now at 43 I understand I have no idea what I’m doing (circle of life right there). Just keep learning.
When I hear about people learning at 10 and people like Elon Musk learning programming when they were so young and all that, it is a bit intimidating because I’m 25. But I figure it’s just a set back and obviously still possible, just gotta put in the hours and sacrifice a few goats 
You’ll be fine. And male goats with nice horns...2 of them.
It will be done my Lord 🐐 🐐 
Turns out a bunch of API changes were made in Swift 4 and not a easy problem to track down due to lack of documentation (but someone on stackoverflow had the answer). The camera flash can only be implemented when a picture is taken, so you have to set the flash each time you take a picture. @IBAction func TakePhoto(_ sender: Any) { let settings = AVCapturePhotoSettings() if flashButtonImage.currentBackgroundImage == imageLiteral(resourceName: "icons8-flash-off-48") { settings.flashMode = .off } else { settings.flashMode = .on } photoOutput?.capturePhoto(with: settings, delegate: self) } 
I’m about to have a year by learning Swift and I consider myself an aficionado of this beautiful language. The thing here is to keep practicing and reading. Honestly, that is the best part of the language.
You should look into geohashing and probably make use of the geolocation features in redis.
I don’t mind the posts asking for coding help if they show some code and effort. The ones that get me are where there are inane questions like some of the ones you mentioned. The other set of posts I dislike are the ones that are basically advertisements for bad blog posts.
Elitist much?
If it’s like every other group I’ve seen that’s halfway technical, you need ten noobs at any given time to get one that sticks with it. Although, The noob’s questions of this week should be answered by the noobs of last week. And their answers should be checked by the noobs of the week before that. The noobs of last year should roll their eyes and say “again?!?” but not really chime in. This helps reinforce the material. :D
yes, please. this makes this sub unbearable. I had to unsubscribe to not flood my feed with "how can I change a button label?" style questions that could be answered by looking at the documentation. and most of the time those questions aren't even related to swift directly but about UIkit. other language specific subreddits don't have that problem. mods, maybe create a "r/swiftbeginners" or so and ruthlessly send people to there?
OPs point is valid. People can’t bother to Google the absolute basics but want to program
This is unrelated to swift the language. This seems to be an API issue. Please refer to the API's documentation.
don't force unwrap stuff unless you want the result you're getting
If you're completely new to programming: No idea, it's an individual issue and it might take from weeks to years. Depends on you. If you already know a programming language: A few weeks. Most work will be done on learning the APIs. If you know programming and Apple's APIs: A weekend.
I’m a recent grad and started learning swift during my internship during the summer (NZ Nov-Feb) and prior to that the only programming experience I had was from university studies. I only have experience doing Java and some JavaScript, but basically just the basics of programming as a whole. I’ve been an iOS developer since and honestly it wasn’t difficult getting to know the language, but learning the different frameworks, architectures and patterns was probably the more challenging part. I’m still learning and it’s actually been really fun! I hadn’t programmed in this way before so it was interesting learning it, and I think I can honestly say it’s been one of the best languages I’ve learned so far!
Are there resources in the sidebar that we can point new developers to and have mods restrict those kinds of posts? I agree half the posts here or on iOS programming are related to “what do I need to learn to get a job” 
I joined the sub not too long ago and this was the first thing I looked out for. There are no sticky post for newcomers. Nothing. So I think this complain from OP is down to moderation. There are no weekly threads. Nothing. 
I think people asking noob questions and not even bothering to find the answers on their own first are separate problems.
in labels* Don't randomly capitalize words. English doesn't work that way. Use an NSNumberFormatter. 
What kind of weekly threads would be the most helpful? What would you want to see more often?
Is there some reason we don't have a FAQ or noob section? At least then the questions would be there and we wouldn't have as many repeat question. TBH, Reddit doesn't search as well as the classic forums do. Reddit can be a source of fast answers when compared to a classic forum, but it's really not as good otherwise.
\+1 for FAQ page
This usually happens when outlets are not connected.
This is valid, however the reason i asked my question was because i just wanted to see where to go next, i had seen Angela Yu's Udemy course but i wasn't sure if it was a good place to start. but I'm all for a FAQ page with resources to start. I would have gone there if the resource was available.
Sidebar resources would be nice. I’m new and settled on - Angela Yu’s Udemy Course - Pro Swift by Paul Hudson - Stanford CS 193P Course - Apple’s Everyone Can Code Books - John Sundell’s Blog - Apple Developer Documentation, Samples and Resources
Posts like this bring on mixed feelings as there are no completely right answers and frankly the density of stupidity isnt that bad. Such posts are actually useful if you are a hiring manager because it is easy to thin out the self starters or the people that put in a little effort. Many of the posts ive seen would immediately disqualify a candidate as being lazy, unable to even put in a little effort before posting. The only posts that really bother me are from the people claiming to know "programming" and yet cant find their way around the internet to get questions answered. You are left with the idea that they are complete failures looking for the next position they can occupy for awhile. Sadly strong demand likely means they will find a job some place. As some one else said it basically is all about effort. Show some code or maybe ask an intelligent question about an API. The real learning comes from a bit of struggle and a helping hand from time to time. I really dont want to see learners driven out of this forum nor do i want to see it become an unfriendly place. As for getting upset due to posts from what amount to complete morons; why read the posts in the first place? Seriously if you are bothered dont read them. 
We need a weekly "beginner's thread" or "Moronic Monday" as r/investing calls it. 
Thanks. That is a valuable information.
A weekly questions thread would be great! /r/android has a "Moronic Monday" questions thread where every question is allowed. Something similar to that with a less aggressive name could be really beneficial
It was a comment by an Apple dev on the developer forum. Sadly no more info was given :(
This is why I love RSS. Once marked read, it will never show up in my feed again, and it's trivial to ignore the low effort posts. If only Reddit had a way to disappearate such posts after being marked "read," they would quickly end up in the dustbin (downvoting doesn't seem to be effective enough). 
/u/joebro123/ has mentioned a perfect one... Honestly mods needs to just clamp down harder. I’m probably a victim of posting these types of questions but if mods were more vigilant then OP won’t be complaining. But an important one to have is a thread that’s sticky with helpful answers to frequent questions. 
Odds are you know this, but Reddit has RSS feeds. I've been slowly moving *everything* I check with any regularity to to RSS – Reddit feeds, YouTube subscriptions, Twitter lists. It's awesome. 
Oh, absolutely. RSS is the Front Door of Reddit for me. It would be intolerable to use without RSS. Since RSS is so uncool amongst people these days, I was merely suggesting that if Reddit has some RSS-like features, it might benefit by effectively hiding low-effort posts. 
I am new, but not completely. I had 2 awkward encounters with programming. last year, I tried with an unhelpful yt course (Swift) and another with one of my friends (C++). 
Swift 4.2 is not out, the most current Swift is 4.1.2
It’s in Beta. I surely we should know about it. 
There could be a mention of it, sure, but 4.2 not a released version.
Please post code as text, not as an image. It's much easier to answer questions when you have the text since it can then be copied into a Playground and tested.
Solved! Thank you! 
It’s up to the sub to educate their subscribers on this lol. Do you see what I mean? 
[`UndoManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/undomanager) A quick web search: [UndoManager Tutorial: How to Implement With Swift Value Types](https://www.raywenderlich.com/187940/undomanager-tutorial-how-to-implement-with-swift-value-types)
Permanent FAQ Thread and AutoMod removes any new posts with titles relating to what OP stated.
I can make a Twitter list a RSS feed? You are a beautiful person. Life changing. 
I said this a while ago and got downvoted but seriously. The noob posts make me not even want to collaborate here. 
Other programming reddits often split into a general discussion and a learning Reddit. For example /r/Python and /r/LearnPython Though it does require an active community of people willing to help the learning Reddit. I don't think the swift Reddit is active enough to do such a thing unfortunately. Another one is making a sticky for ask anything.
I like the idea of an FAQ. Maybe some extra rules to try to manage these types of posts - like: Search first. Check the FAQ (presuming one is developed), etc.
Great idea! Can I up vote this one more than once?
Actually this is news to me. I had not even thought to check to see. I guess I am a little thick. Thanks for the tip! Up Vote!
AppCode has some nice features; it's not perfect but pretty decent and in some ways better than Xcode. It has a free trial so you can test it out and see if you prefer it. See https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/ for an overview.
So, OP... HoW LONg wiLL IT Take Me to LEArn the SWIFT?
Hi.Interesting comment! I'm curious as to why Swift is your preferred language? Have you used Swift outside of iOS programming? Currently, I only have experience with Python but Swift feels kind of verbose compared to Python. However, this may be due to Apple's APIs. Traversing directories, accessing hardware seems to be very verbose, and sometimes difficult (again maybe just Apple's problem).
You need a loop and you shouldn’t need a switch at all. Use a variable as the key to the dictionary instead 
Just to clarify on the title, you still need to have Xcode installed. That said, JetBrains IDEs are awesome, and although I have not used AppCode for some time now, I recommend giving it a try.
Why do you recommend it, if you haven't used it in awhile?
Refactoring is much better.
 func frequency(numbers: [Int]) -&gt; [Int: Int] { return [Int: Int](numbers.map({($0, 1)}), uniquingKeysWith: +) } Maps each value into a pair of `(value, 1)` then makes a `Dictionary` out of those pairs with each repeated value adding to the already-existing one.
You can use [`init(_:uniquingKeysWith:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/2995340-init) to do this. Just map each key into a pair like `( key, 1 )` and then use an addition operator to add duplicates.
Pros: - Vim Plugin is better - Tabbed UI is more familiar/traditional than the Xcode Assistant Editor and tabs scheme - Better themes (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui) - Files load instantly, in Xcode there's always a little lag before a file is displayed in the source editor Cons: - I usually have to build to see errors (Xcode is good about highlighting them quickly - before I build (might be a bug that just affects my setup though)) - I can't get the SwiftLint plugin to work correctly (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9175-swiftlint), seems to be a bug/issue with my configuration 
&gt; That one probably seems silly, but when I first used AppCode and switched back to Xcode I realized that I tend to lose focus when switching files due to the delay What kind of computer are you on? Ive loaded storyboards with 30 VC's In them instantly between tabs. (I've since refactored them all out using storyboard references though :)) Granted I'm on an iMac. 
Anyone know if they fixed the bug where auto-complete didn't work with some 3rd party libraries? Like for example if you have SnapKit and type `label.snp.` there were no suggestions at all.
Thanks! I tried this, but why isn't it working? `func frequency(numbers: [Int]) -&gt; [Int: Int] {` `var occurences = [Int : Int]()` `for num in numbers {` `if num == 1 {` `occurences[1] += 1` `} else if num == 2 {` `occurences[2] += 1` `} else if num == 3 {` `occurences[3] += 1` `} else if num == 4 {` `occurences[4] += 1` `} else if num == 5 {` `occurences[5] += 1` `} else if num == 6 {` `occurences[6] += 1` `} else if num == 7 {` `occurences[7] += 1` `} else if num == 8 {` `occurences[8] += 1` `} else if num == 9 {` `occurences[9] += 1` `} else {` `occurences[1] += 0` `}` `return occurences` `}` `}`
I think I was wrong on that. I guess what makes it faster for me with AppCode is the vim bindings (gt/gT) to go backward/forward through tabs.
Why not: occurences[num] += 1
Swift is a great language but poorly adopted outside of the iOS/MacOS app world. There are moves to build back-end services with Swift but that's still in the early stages. Compared to JVM languages or C/C++, Swift is fantastic, well built and easy to read. If you're coming from PHP/Python/Ruby, you'll need to practice building complex data structures with generics. It takes some getting used to but there are amazing videos by Apple and others. For instance: [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/)
I don’t know if you omitted it from your paste but I would have expected an import RCS statement. You may also have a spelling error on your UIStoryBoard(withIdentifier:) I would recommend wrapping identifiers in an enum with their string values. Write once as a string, no potential misspelling issues :)
That does make it better. But, it's still not working.
I wonder will people looking to take this on as independent study who aren’t in school anymore be able to.
where can i find more of these nice and clean habits?
Since you're obviously working on it and not having success I'll show you two compact ways to do this: The first way is like this: Dictionary(numbers.map {($0, 1)}) { $0 + $1 } I'll break it down: // generate a sequence of key-value pairs // the values represent one occurrence of that key let pairs = numbers.map {($0, 1)} // make a Dictionary of all the keys // adding up each occurrence when there's a repetition Dictionary(pairs, uniquingKeysWith: { $0 + $1 }) And the second way: numbers.reduce(into: [:]) { $0[$1, default: 0] += 1} This one iterates over each key in `numbers`. It creates an empty `Dictionary` and if the key does not exist in the Dictionary it inserts that key with a value of 0. Then it adds one to the value associated with the key. So the first time a key is encountered the `Dictionary` gets it with a value of 0, then adds 1 to it. The second time it adds 1 again, and so on.
