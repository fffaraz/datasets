Another reason to go with Dataflow: you can limit concurrency in your graph (thus limiting memory usage) while still having an asynchronous pipeline. If at some stage you have to change the processing, you add a block in the pipeline.
This ain't no joke, buddy. Sure it can be done with separate regex. However since this is a complex problem it requires the power of MoreLinq. public static void Main() { var str = "ThisIsAStringThatSaySomething_010"; var pattern1 = @"[^_]+(?=_)"; var pattern2 = @"(?&lt;=_)\d+"; var result = Enumerable.Repeat(str, 1) .SelectMany(s =&gt; GetMatches(s, pattern1, pattern2)) .Batch(2) .Select(m =&gt; (str: m.First(), number: int.Parse(m.Skip(1).First()))).First(); Console.WriteLine(result); } private static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; GetMatches(string str, string pattern1, string pattern2) { yield return Regex.Match(str, pattern1).Value; yield return Regex.Match(str, pattern2).Value; }
According to this page, the paper and eBook editions are only out later in the month. But if you purchase it directly from Manning you should be able to read the "livebook" and PDF versions immediately.
I would try to avoid putting it into one method. As a general rule of thumb, I don't like to have to scroll to read a whole method, and I use a slightly larger font because I'm no longer young, plus the output pane at the bottom. I've heard others advocate for anywhere from a 10 line to 30 line length on methods. Personally, I don't think it's an absolute, which is why I go with "don't make me scroll". Robert Martin makes the case that any given method should be human readable to the point where a BA or other non-techie could figure out what's going on. To do this, he suggests refactoring to other methods with meaningful names, repeating until it's all pretty tight. My experience leads me to believe this isn't usually strictly possible, but it also serves as a good rule of thumb. Ask yourself, "How can I make the code more readable to someone coming in cold?" Comments don't count. :) Without seeing the code, I'm not sure I can give better answers.
Do you know if Stream Deck works on Linux? Would be awesome to have that for coding in Rider.
all right my method later today or tomorrow and I'll post the code of the method. I'll have everything with usable names rather than push the entire application..
The hardware does, there's OSS libraries for working with it - but I don't think there's a decent UI for programming it and feeding keypresses etc.
Glad it was useful. One caution about leaning too heavily on third-party APIs is that they really do have to maintain backward compatibility, so they don't grow as organically. Presumably, the architects planning things out have enough experience to eyeball things, in advance. You will, almost certainly, find some odd things, though. Their design goals and constraints are not yours. Use pragmatically. Now, if you're creating an API for external consumption, that's a different ball of wax and you won't be able to be as organic. I get a lot more picky about the contracts on REST APIs, for example.
&gt; If you want it done in the CompanyService, then inject the db context to that class instead of passing it to a method. Honestly, I've been reading up on DI for a while but I'm still having trouble grasping the basics. Really not sure how to do this. The idea of passing it to a method was actually to inject it though I always knew that's not how DI works but I don't understand how to do it properly.
He can be a doctor as long as he writes code. PhD in Software Development maybe. Dr. Dev has a nice ring to it. 
Awesome! After getting a new 486 I purchased myself VB6 from my school bookstore as well. At the time mostly because it came bundled with NT 4 which really interested me but I also was really surprised at how much VB had evolved. My first DOS was actually MS-DOS 3.21 and later on I found a MS-DOS 1.0 floppy in a pile of rubble left behind after a business was demolished. I took it home, cleaned all the mud and sand out of it and amazingly it still worked! If only I still had it! Later on I got a copy of 2.11 and 4.01 from friends. From what I remember, 4.01 was sooooo slow on my 8088.
/r/learncsharp 
But where is the "commit all and force push to master" button?
Then skip DI and just make use of IoC alone. Just create an instance of `CompanyService` yourself, and pass the `ApplicationDbContext` in the constructor. Don't keep a reference to the db context in your page, but instead of your service.
I would take the fluent api mappings out and rely on convention for most of this. I think you've messed something up in the the modelbuilder mappings.
If you like C# and StreamDeck you should take a look at this: https://github.com/OpenMacroBoard/StreamDeckSharp (Disclaimer: I'm the author)
I saw this actually! I'm thinking of making my own replacement software for the streamdeck to replace the offical one since it's so limited using this library.
This and the dependency injection book as well. This will be fun over the next month.
&gt; Their design goals and constraints are not yours. Use pragmatically. This is something that I'm just coming to terms with as a beginner. There's no 'one size fits all' architecture, even for applications which are similar, as you need to account for what the user's original intention as well as what coding practices they prefer.
I'll share a simple example when I'm home in about half an hour
Lol Run, yeah F5 is hard to remember, hehe.
After I'd done the annoying ones (CTRL+K, D to reformat text) I was just filling in the gaps with things I did frequently xD
May I suggest 'Collapse to definition' (to collapse all methods) and the others, those are the ones I often forget.
I have been eagerly waiting for the printed book, read the first couple chapters online and it's a great revision
You are multiplying the index not the value of the element, like this.
Are you sure you're not trying to do: b[x] = a[x] * 2; The number in the brackets is the array index. Since your array only has 3 items, when x = 2, you are trying to access index 4 which doesn't exist.
Oh I see thank you!
Oh wow. I have to try that to see if it works. Still reads a little awkward, but sort of getting there… and would enable stuff like `is (ErrorCode.OK, var result)`.
Ok thank you!
I've been checking Manning almost daily for these two books. It's a great day!
Just remember the shortcuts in your head and save some money. 
The reason I wrote SteamDeckSharp was because I wanted to replace the original software and allow for plugins that span over multiple keys, etc. But at the moment I'm pretty busy so I released the library on it's own.
I didn't touched anything in Fluent. All I did was set up the models, then `add-migration name` and then `update-database`. I haven't modified anything in the Migration files.
I actually want to do things like a better plugin system for handling press+hold and animation. Cpu usage graph etc. 
Well, with regular MVC Razor, I always thought Areas were pretty fucky and needed some, to me, BS boiler plate code, whereas adding a folder requires no effort. Not sure if it is the same in Razor Pages.
The hardware is a HID (Human Interface Device) so it's definitely possible but I haven't tried it. I think this lib works on Linux: https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck
But what is a million reputation on stack overflow. I mean, pretty much everyone has that, right? It's really nothing special... (yes, I am totally kidding, I know that he's the only one) Also, I bought this book some time ago :)
I've been looking forward to finally getting this book in the mail. Can't wait for it to arrive!
&gt; Nothing would have prevented the team from adding the same solution to `System.Tuple`. That's my impression as well, but I couldn't find any discussion of this in `roslyn` or `csharplang`. Maybe nobody has brought it up as an idea?
&gt;English is my second language. Then you're gonna learn to love Latin as your third language, which "per se" is. ;-)
Lol
That is actually brilliant
I mean I doubt anyone would go out to and boy one specifically for visual studio. I personally think this is a really neat idea if you already have one
I was wondering that. All (except opening VS and VS) are hotkeys I have memorized except maybe set breakpoint.
Hmm, well I can say that I'm definitely eager loading 1-to-1's (mapped with .WithOne()) in .ThenInclude (multiple levels down of .ThenIncludes as well). For example: https://i.imgur.com/a/5famZVR.jpg 
As someone fairly new to git I got this joke.
They wanted to add a `ValueTuple` for performance reasons. Adding the same functionality for `Tuple` would mean they need to add a way to distinguish those two. They just skipped that effort, as `Tuple` is a shit type that should never have existed in the first place.
Dude this is dope. 
Would this be a good book for an entry level c# programmer looking to improve? Should I start with a different book? I'm def not a beginner in the sense that I know what the features of the language are (for the most part) but more so dont know when I should implement each one. 
It’s not clear to me what the point of shipping Tuple without any syntax was. Seems useless.
Sweet dreams are made of these
C# 8 is around the corner. RIP
For those looking for C# 8 info (I was replying to a comment that was deleted lol), here are some tidy bits from the book: He talks about C# 8 in the last chapter, but not that much in depth: &gt; There’s been a lot more text than code in this chapter, mostly because I don’t want to present too much code which will become flat out wrong by the time C# 8 ships. I very much doubt that all the features I’ve described will be present in C# 8, but I think it’s at least very likely that some of them will. I’d be very surprised if nullable reference types or the pattern-related features didn’t make it into C# 8. He covers the most important stuff (nullable ref types, default interfaces, array slices, etc) that was added to in v8 by the way. 
Decided to do what I probably should have done in the first place: went with a list. Made everything go much easier and it works perfectly. Thanks for your help, sir!
Yes, you're a perfect case for it. 
You should post your proposal on the csharplang github repo. [https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues) This is where all language proposals are discussed.
Why do you find this exciting? I work 6 years already as developer. Do you think it will still be interestong to read for me? 
Honestly, yes. This book is so good at what it does it's an excellent read for *all levels* of C# experience. I absolutely did not get LINQ until I read this book. Skeet does a good job getting into nuts and bolts and demonstrating not just that things work, but how they work. I sort of ignore features until I've seen how Skeet explains them now.
Ok... this is epic
Did you order the epub?
The physical + ePub.
I made my own replacement using this and the icons from material design toolkit as it was easier than creating my own, you can also find the files for the visual studio icons and directly use them.
Great article, I'm waiting for part 2.
Jon Skeet's book is pretty much interesting at all levels. He is really in depth. I went into his book at a novice level and learned a shit ton, and even looking at it again with the light bulbing still shining, it was still really interesting and pushed me further. I think in a year I will still be able to look back at it and learn something new.
I've worked 3 years full time as developer and I'm still eager to learn new stuff. Unless you know the content of the books, I guess you can't know if you'll learn something new. 
Thanks, I have a bunch of other to-read books. That's why I'm asking ..
I think one org for your whole corp should be fine. You can create "teams" and assign the teams permissions to projects. Naming is probably up to you. I just call my org my company name.
Thanks, will deliver soon.
The PDF version, is it literally just a PDF that I can copy on all my devices "no strings attached" or is it tied to some software that allows you access to it? 
We started using these this way, but we ended up moving to `Either&lt;TSuccess, TError&gt;` to prevent bad co-habitations, eg: `(false, successResult)`.
The PDF I downloaded can be copied freely, it just has a message "Licensed to &lt;name&gt; &lt;email&gt;" at the bottom of each page. 
Could you elabore a bit on the &gt; query the list of hashes that are not in the server database part? How do I find out which hashes are not in the server db? The only thing that makes sense to me is that you pull all server hases and find out which hash is not in the db. Then you can push the difference. Is that what you mean? &amp;#x200B;
Thanks for this!
Well, no idea what caused it, but I wiped my entire database, and deleted all the migrations, and re-created it from scratch, and now it works. Probably one of the migrations caused something that corrupted the maps. If anyone cares, here are all my migrations (just the migrations, nothing else): [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bonXQNbwnu0Qf35UpnoTVUz93lkPd6Dk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bonXQNbwnu0Qf35UpnoTVUz93lkPd6Dk)
f9. haha. Pretty dope if you haven’t memorized them already.
Actually I meant the other way aroud, as I assume you would have more record in the central dB than in local. You would submit a list of hashes to the server. The server does the comparaison and return the unmatched
I wrote basic physics solutions as general functions. was fun. didnt do the more advanced ones but say you were trying to measure the coefficient of friction but had all the other data, just not hte cooefficient dump it into my function and result. helped with mandated online homework too
stealing this for the future if i even teach people about arrays
Shortcuts for computer games and shortcuts for dev environments are two different beasts altogether. Videogame: Quicksave = F5 Visual Studio: Open Javascript Console: CTRL + ALT + V, C
I don't know if this really warrants a program. Let's say 4/3 * pi * a * b * c = V. Let 4/3 * pi = φ φabc=V. a= 1 * r; b = 2 * r; c = 4 * r; ( V / (a*b*c*φ)) ^(1/3) =r = ~2. x, y, z = r*a, r*b, r*c = ~2, ~4, ~8. Instead of calling the object "Size", I'd call it something like "Ratio". This is just an algebra problem.
It gets funnier when somebody actually does it and you see panic break out in the office because 3 days of work has gone missing 😂😂 
time to try it and see the chaos :)
I feel like this proposal does not do the primary thing that default interfaces are meant to do: allow additions to a published interface. If I wanted to add a \`bool IsEmpty { get; }\` property to the \`ICollection&lt;T&gt;\` interface, with the current proposal, I can do: \`\`\` interface ICollection&lt;T&gt; { // existing members bool IsEmpty =&gt; Count == 0; } \`\`\` With your proposal, I could not do that, as it would break every implementation of \`ICollection&lt;T&gt;\` until they added an interface default themselves.
yeah, definitely not
I could name u 20 vs / resharper shortcuts without big thinking...when u work 7h a day with them u get used to it so quickly
I have a very basic experience with c# but I learned Java and Object Oriented Programming somewhat decently at University. Is this a good book to start up on C#?
You're welcome! To be honest, I feel like you can easily over-use the named tuples, since for most cases a simple type can make a code much easier to read and maintain. But sometimes it's really useful to be able to declare and set multiple variables at once, that's why I like the deconstruction a lot. However don't over-use it too ;)
I'm getting a uterus installed so I can have your babies.
So what about the other 480 that you don't remember? That you use infrequently? That's where things like this come in :)
Aaand this is why I suck at math. Object oriented programming is super easy - I've converted wpf hmi mimics to dwg, I've generated visio and excel files, all super-easy. But this twists my mind. How is V defined by using abc that aren't defined yet? How are abc defined using r which isn't defined yet? How is r defined using abc which are defined by r? Circular... How are x,y,z defined using r,a,b,c that define themselves? "Just an algebra problem" ... that I'm unable to make into a function I can call.
Then feel free to submit a post with the results of your research in your post description. 
What does the Internet think about using ValueTuple as the key into a dictionary (instead of Tuple)? var myDict = new Dictionary&lt;ValueTuple&lt;T1,T2&gt;,T3&gt;(); I find that myDict.Add((val1,val2),"sugar"); is much more readable than myDict.Add(new Tuple&lt;int,int&gt;(val1,val2),"sugar"); 
A console application does not have any hooks to detect mouse gestures.

For REST APIs, I usually use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to define my APIs, then export stub server code. While their new OAS3 version only supports about 8 server stubs, the Swagger2 interface specifications can export server stub code in a couple of dozen languages &amp; frameworks, including some native to .NET. This approach has a number of benefits: * Beautiful, interactive interface documentation is automatically produced from the specification * The documentation includes a live testing sandbox * Your users can review the specification online and export their own client stubs in a variety of languages.
Everything you mentioned is pretty cool. My own life path required a lot of math. Everything above is just algebra. I saw your response during the day, and was thinking about it. I was kind of hoping it would require some iteration, but it seemed to be straightforward. When I got home I just wrote it down on a piece of paper. I was thinking of just putting it into a Google Spreadsheet, since that's all it really warrants without knowing how it fits in with everything else. I'm not truly defining V anywhere. I'm just doing algebra. Here's a sloppy implementation. I typically don't try to draw relationships between rectangles and squares, but in this case, the ellipsoid seems to be a special case of a sphere. If you asked for surface area, I'd most certainly separate them and have no connection between them whatsoever. using System; namespace Ellipsoid { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Ratio ratio = new Ratio { a = 1, b = 2, c = 4 }; Ellipsoid E = new Ellipsoid(ratio, 268.08); Console.WriteLine(E.StringAxes()); Console.ReadKey(); } } public class Ratio { public double a, b, c; public Ratio() { } } public class Ellipsoid { public double r; public Ratio a; const double thing = 4 * Math.PI / 3; public Ellipsoid(Ratio a, double V) { this.a = a; this.r = Math.Pow(V / a.a / a.b / a.c / thing, (1.0 / 3)); } double GetVolume() { return a.a * a.b * a.c * Math.Pow(r, 3) * thing; } public string StringAxes() { return $"{ this.r * a.a}, {this.r*a.b}, {this.r*a.c} yields a volume of {this.GetVolume()}"; } } } 
 I haven't had a chance to read your post yet, but I've added it to my list. You may find this link interesting - it's where I usually refer developers who want a deeper understanding of `async`/`await` behind the scenes. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/seteplia/2017/11/30/dissecting-the-async-methods-in-c/
Does your interface code startup and then run for a long time, monitoring events in one or both SaaS platforms? If so, one of my preferred patterns (in Windows Environments) for interfaces of this type is to implement it as a Windows Service. If it needs a user interface, I typically expose that via HTTP (or REST)! If this is a mission-critical interface that requires high availability, it is easy to define Windows Services as a HA resource in a Windows Server Failover Cluster, so that your service will remain operational in the event of a cluster event. On the other hand, if your interface is occasionally invoked by an outside event (say, a REST call or a timer) which causes your code to do some interface work and then quit until invoked again, you might consider taking a different approach: Author it to run in a cloud "serverless" environment. I like Amazon Lambda, which supports .Net and is cheap, high-performing and reliable. You an configure an Amazon API gateway to receive the REST call and then launch your .Net code as a Lambda microservice. For small projects with relatively few invocations, this will likely be entirely free, and your interface can run without any servers to manage. Handy!
'if I don't use them I don't need them'. Okay then, if you're that short sighted about the different shortcuts resharper and visual studio provide, then any attempt to reason with you is futile.
HERO! I'm setting up a profile for mine as we speak.

To add to this. A class named functions or utilities is usually a code smell. Smaller projects may morph classes and functions much easier than larger ones. So as he said, don’t worry about being so final/absolute about everything as you can change it the smaller the project. Being mindful of organization is the takeaway here. 
I would assume he was referring to a game like World of Warcraft where you can have multiple keybindings. (Ctrl + q, alt + q, ctrl + shift + q, etc...) You can always bind your own shortcut instead of using the defaults if they are not to your liking. I personally like to blend the keywords in the shortcuts. E.g. ctrl + o, ctrl + c (open, console)

Removed: Rule 4.
Can you supply some sample output? Are you expecting it to output fractions?
&gt; My fundamental issue is that interfaces can include private and static members, which is getting away from what an interface is meant for. If this is a fundamental issue, perhaps you can dive into it a bit more? What is it about inclusion of private/static members on the interface that's an issue for you? Do I understand their usage correctly that these belong to the `IMyInterface` type and don't have an impact on implementors? Maybe what is your perception of "what an interface is meant for" that creates this conflict? And why is it a Bad Thing™ for interfaces to enhance their usage?
Using integers in division is problematic. Check out this example https://repl.it/repls/ComplicatedAthleticCamel
Just use dotnet core and the new span and memory APIs.
static vs dynamic and strong vs weak typing is a pet peeve of mine. so many people get it wrong.
You are trying to consume REST interfaces more generically or in a more graceful way,. In terms of liraries there I'd [check out ServiceStack](https://docs.servicestack.net/csharp-client) sharp clients, it has a bunch and they are pretty easy. The real way to do this is with an Enterprise Integration System like MuleSoft or ws2o (this one is free). Microsoft logicapps has connectors for many prioprietary web services and will let you use XSLT for any transformations, not my cup of tea but? If you are looking to transform data there are tools like [Altova pretty great MapForce i](https://www.altova.com/)s , code free drag and drop mapping, has loads of built in transformation capabilities and its visual mapping, schema to schema, REST to csv, REST to DB, DB to CSV, DB to rest, Excel, Xml, json, almost any format, etc. You can do the whole transform and export it as C#, Java&lt; XSLT or Built in Altova format. If you want to use Altova's format they have server tools. 
I don't know why all the downvotes. &amp;#x200B; The OP sincerely asked about passing references to variables in functions. That's what I did. &amp;#x200B; Regardless if it is a horrible way or improper way to handle said functionality, really doesn't matter. &amp;#x200B; What matters, is it is a "way it can be done". &amp;#x200B; For example, lets say you did &amp;#x200B; `Dog.WashDog(theDog);` and theDog is the reference, it would work without doing: &amp;#x200B; `theDog = Dog.WashDog(theDog);` or `theDog.WashDog();` &amp;#x200B; it's just a different way to accomplish the same thing, regardless of efficiency.
If you haven't already, I would suggest filing feedback on each issue after you hit it. The top right in VS has a "File Feedback" icon. It may not be an immediate sollution, but it does help vocalize that you're hitting problems and contribute towards the area getting better. You can view other feedbacks at [Developers Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com) and +1 if you're hitting the same thing. 
What is a pbook?
Paper/physical book.
I use it all the time, it's great.
I completely tuned out on DIM for any kind of OOP/compositional/traits benefits when I learned that "inherited" default methods are explicitly implemented rather than implicitly. I don't see how it has any benefit to OO design this way. I *especially* don't want them to mention anything like "traits" anywhere *near* this proposal; because it does not resemble any traits implementation I've ever seen. I'm still fine with it as a feature for supporting backwards compatibility/adding new members to existing interfaces.

Can’t you protect a branch in git? I’ve only dabbled in git, but my 9-yr web platform is all in SVN. Even if someone on the team I run tried to commit directly to trunk... it wouldn’t let them.
Is this an internal or internet facing service?
This is the book that I finally learned from how linq actually works. This along with Clr via c# are the two best books I have read on .Net. Anytime I feel overly confident in my c# skills, I read Mr. Skeet's blog, crashes me right back to the ground
Thanks for the support friend.
&gt; https://github.com/nlkl/Optional Promises and maybes. Haven't used those for a while. Seems interesting :) 
So do I, I have not tested it, but assuming ValueTuple is a value type, while Tuple is a reference type, equality checks for the key will also be improved
Internal, I don't think my company want this product to be a SaaS in the near future (or ever) 
Ok, but how can I use swagger to make a gateway for multiple services? 
I had nothing but problems with Xamarin, it felt like most of my time was being spent battling the buggy framework. Gradle was somewhat difficult to learn but now I'm extremely happy developing Android apps in Android studio. I greatly preffered some of the features of visual studio, in many ways AS feels rudimentary when compared to VS. Still, my time is more productive in AS. Your may vary.
You can but sometimes you need the force push option.
*on
The point is that Dog is a class and hence all method invocations automatically are pass-by-reference. You don‘t need the ref keyword as there is no copy of dog but only of the pointer to dog on method invocation. If you add the ref keyword you create a pointer to a pointer to dog and hence could point the initial pointer to a different dog. But you don‘t want to exchange the dog by a different one but just wash it. That means you don‘t need the ref keyword. If dog would‘ve been a struct you‘d be right as method invocations are pass-by-value and hence there is a copy operation involved which would create a second dirty dog that is washed inside the method but the first dirty dog is still dirty. Then you‘d need to use the ref keyword in order to pass the struct by reference.
Yea, no way, we're limited to NET Framework 3.5, because of some finicky clrhost wrapper done by someone who long left. But this implementation is very different to every other around for FoxPro, that we can not migrate. Because it would **a)** take a long time **b)** will introduce bugs (already did some tests)
You're not supposed to multiply the index

var combined = results.selectmany(x=&gt;x.result);
You could either loop through all the elements var outputList = new List&lt;Item&gt;(); foreach(var list in lists) foreach(var item in list) outputList.Add(item); or just use LINQ like this: var outputList = lists.SelectMany(t=&gt; t).ToList()

To fix this error either change the JSON to a JSON array (e.g. [1,2,3]) or change the deserialized type so that it is a normal .NET type (e.g. not a primitive type like integer, not a collection type like an array or List&lt;T&gt;) that can be deserialized from a JSON object. JsonObjectAttribute can also be added to the type to force it to deserialize from a JSON object. Path 'results', line 1, position 12.'

So in this case you don't have a List&lt;List&lt;Item&gt;, unless you deliberately combine them like that. Assuming that the json you provided is surrounded with { } to define the root object, and you add the property to Category public class Category { public string Name { get; set; } } then this gives me a list with 1 item in the end string stringWithJson = "{\"results\": [{\"result\": [{\"Name\": \"Test\"}]}]}"; List&lt;Category&gt; flatList = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Results&gt;(stringWithJson).results .SelectMany(r =&gt; r.result) .ToList();
&gt;.results .SelectMany(r =&gt; r.result) .ToList(); &amp;#x200B; This seem to work, but right now in every model class file I have. There is a 
You can make the outer containers be generic I guess. For example public class Result&lt;T&gt; { public List&lt;T&gt; Results { get; set; } } Then you can reuse that one and not redefine it all the time.
You can do a trial of the enterprise license. I believe it’s 60 or 90 days. 
With a Godzilla icon, please.
I still prefer Albahari Nutshell books. They put much more focus on new language features.
Great news! Loved the previous edition
[Like this?](https://i.imgur.com/QD2G53Q.gifv)
There is also `.Restart`, which resets and starts.
Private members seems like a really weird thing, given what "interface" means. In Swift, protocols (same as interface) can include both static members and notably constructor requirements. That last one is quite powerful.
Honestly, you're better off buying a beginners C# book instead of asking these questions here all the time.
'Build apps 100x times faster' Is that 100x benchmarked and documented or is it another 'we-lack-credibility' type of thing?
so its a suite of UI components ? I've used Infragistics and found them to be inflexible
All these "Drag &amp; drop an application together a bazillion times faster" shams like OutSystems, BettyBlocks and the many, many other ripoffs like these are fun for your typical CRUD application or simple CRM package. For the rest: meh.
Here is a coupon code for today [https://www.retailmenot.com/view/manning.com?c=8942326&amp;redemptionChannel=online](https://www.retailmenot.com/view/manning.com?c=8942326&amp;redemptionChannel=online)
Should I create an own file for this ?
Removed: Rule 4.
Know of any free solutions out there that would allow someone with almost no C# skills to throw together simple prototypes?
OutSystems is free to a certain amount of 'blocks' (components you use in a project) which is good enough to try it out.
Would you recommend this book for someone that uses C# in Unity?
Thanks - going to play around with it this weekend. I hate wasting our devs time on stuff like this.
C# and java are pretty similar, you shouldn’t have any problems. I would pick up a course on Udemy, I really like Mosh Hamedani’s courses.
Yeah you want to surround only the parts you want to time with a stopwatch instance. Right now you’re also timing the Xamarin Forms code that executes between when it calls your event implementations. 
Any idea of there is a good guide that explains these subjects? 
Awesome, thank you will do. Are you familiar with WPF?
Watching the very limited promotional videos, this feels very similar to other drag and drop web design apps, and is also a bit reminiscent of WebForms programming. That doesn't sound fun to go back to. However, it is really hard to tell much from what content they have on their site without trying it (and I am too lazy). They really need a few longer demo videos... maybe one showing how you would use this to build an app that does some basic CRUD at a minimum.
In the different models you’re trying to deserialize to do you have a root node specified? Looks like you either don’t have one or you have the wrong one specified. Because the error you’re seeing is that the element it’s looking for at the root doesn’t exist. 
I tried it. It's actually very similar to Windows Forms, the designer is much better compared to web forms 
Don't use xamarin.
If I cast it to a known model, then the root node is found and it works as expected. I only get that error when it doesn't know the model...presumably, because in an unknown model, the root element isn't there.
Been a dev for 20 years. I hate computers. And people. And visual studio. Kill me. 
If you are able and have access, take a look around your environment/network and find something you want to improve. I work in at a small location company as the only developer (Junior, myself). A lot of my job ends up being reading my boss' old code and tweaking it and fixing it. Other than that, I try to talk to my users to see if they have any tasks that they would like to have automated (making a 30min task into a 30sec one). Creating your *own* things is definitely more exciting than just creating someone else's. &amp;#x200B; The experience you're getting from that job is going to be invaluable. But I will tell you what I told our Sysadmin right before he left- *If you don't like your workplace then it's best to find one you do like.* &amp;#x200B;
So, a book then. 
I’ve worked on a single MVVM pattern WPF app, so I’m familiar with the framework, but would still rely on stack overflow for anything but the basics.
1) Override .ToString() class MyClass { public string Name { get; set; } // other members public override string ToString() { var sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.AppendLine($"Name: {Name}"); // write to sb for additional props return sb.ToString(); } } Then just call `.ToString()` on an instance of `MyClass` and print the string result to console. &amp;nbsp; 2) Json Serialization. Add a nuget reference to `Newtonsoft`. var myObj = new MyClass(); myObj.Name = "FooBar" var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObj); Console.WriteLine(json); Should note that XML serialization is also an option. &amp;nbsp; 3) Reflection. This example would be lengthy so just look at many of the replies to [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/852181/c-printing-all-properties-of-an-object). &amp;nbsp; Hope this helps.
is there a hardback?
You can use the \`xsi:type\` attribute in XML to specify the type to deserialize. The XMLSerializer must be constructed with all possible types though because it needs to generate code for them; use the constructor with the extraTypes parameter.
Going from Java to C# should be easy. Just look up how to do properties, events, and lambdas and you should be able to pick up the rest as you go. I would suggest finding a course on MVVM with WPF to follow. There is a bit of a learning curve there so you'll want a guiding hand with it.
With some helper code you can deserialize XML to a C# dynamic object. 
For really small projects, start with everything in a single namespace, with no sub-folders. And give that Namespace a meaningful name like `TheBoyPj.ProjectName.App` or just `ProjectName.App`. The `Functions` as a name is way too generic. Once you get up to 20-30 classes, you're going to start seeing patterns like: - These classes are my data models, put those in a `Models` folder. - These are my view model classes, put those in a `ViewModels` folder. - These classes are service classes. - Those look like classes that call external APIs. etc. Eventually, you may get to the point where you want multiple assemblies. One for the App (GUI), one for the core data models and classes that might also be used by a different front-end interface, etc.
Given that they only have 4 "case studies" and I've never heard of a single one of them, I'm going with #2.
Thanks! It's very useful to see how you would subdivide and categorise your codebase as it grows.
As Mark Twain once said, there are 3 types of lies: Lies, damned lies and statistics.
These things have not and will never work for non-trivial applications. They lock you into a specific way of doing things, won't support everything you want to do, and generate unmaintainable piles of garbage. 
Whoa, underrated comment -- THANK YOU! Code **mlagile13** took my discounted subtotal to $27.99.
That mostly comes with experience, and looking at big open-source projects with lots of maintainers. The organizational structure should make sense to the project maintainers. There is no "one true way". It's also a fuzzy categorization and you can over-categorize. Less is often better at the start. Modern IDEs (JetBrains Rider, VS, etc.) all make it easy to move things around and update namespaces and "using" statements. Which means it matters even less that you get it right from day zero. Or at least, it's "moderately inexpensive" to fix naming and organization mistakes later.
Don’t know why you need that level of accuracy but yes, you need to make a new stopwatch. Your constructor gets called first, you start your timer, then you stop it, there is going to be time between starting and stopping. So either declare it as new, or reset it before using it again because stop keeps the current timing, reset zeros it out.
TIL that books used to be made with "paper", a raw material produced from trees! In fact, books produced this way are still available for purchase!
Five years ago I hired a developer to work on WPF similar to the situation you are in. After accepting the position he realized that the amount of effort he would need to put into that versus learning something new that is in high demand (Angular/React at the time) wasn’t going to be a good career move. I respected his honesty and obviously knew even back then Microsoft wasn’t investing in it and he was making a smart decision . I seriously would look at other career options if you are being asked to learn WPF or XAML from scratch now. It wont take much effort to find many former Silverlight or WPF advocates who would give you the same advice.
Downvote him if you wish, but yes on to something. The GC is really bad.
4 case studies is 4 more empirical examples than 99% of programming arguments. not bad! &amp;#x200B;
The first screenshot has a radio button with a check - - proof enough, to me, that they are untrustworthy.

It's the result of Microsoft reflecting on where .net has been and where technology is headed. It's leaner, faster, more compatible, and designed for async off the bat. Object modeling is still object modeling, core didn't change the Earth's orbit. But it is a large change and eventually you'll be a dinosaur if you don't learn it. Akin to the guy in 2005 writing classic asp, or the lady in 2020 using .net 2 webservices and asp.net forms.
It is a framework that allows you to write .NET applications that run on both Linux and Windows. It matters if you need to run apps on Linux. You don't need to do too much different unless you need something Windows specific (in which case it won't be available in .NET Core)
With 3.0 there shouldn't be very much left, maybe ancient things like remoting...
The easiest fix is to change all of the `int` variables to `double`. That will prevent integer truncation from occurring to the values you get from the division. Change the `int.Parse` to `double.Parse` while you're at it, so your users can enter "3.72354" and it not crash (and also they'll get a reasonably accurate answer).
You can look at Event Sourcing (think each change to your data is a delta event)as a logical architecture and you can continue the existing dB engines as storage engines. Shifting from traditional update in place to Event Sourcing (you can think of this as cdc) will make your replication and conflict resolution much simpler and mor easier to deal in your business logic. The great about events is that you don’t have to worry about duplication hence you can freely replicate them. HTH Alex
1. Excel is *old* and there are tons of things that rely on it being able to run existing VBA macros. 2. Excel users are *old* and set in their ways. 3. VBA, being *old*, can integrate with COM objects. That's why you see the derpy mix between dynamic and static types. It also means that you can do *anything* in VBA, since you can do *anything* in C++ and make a COM library out of it. Integrating .Net would actually be a small step *backward*. 4. Excel is *old* and is basically in "maintenance mode" at this point. It's a spreadsheet. There's been nothing new or remarkable about spreadsheets for a few decades now. Microsoft isn't going to invest a crap-ton of money to change the scripting environment of a dead-end software package out from under its established (and paying!) user base. Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. I'm sure there are more.
Where? The only place I see a radio button and a checkbox is here: [https://wisej.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/homepage-image-hero-04D.png](https://wisej.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/homepage-image-hero-04D.png) and they are very clearly two different controls, the radio is selected on the left one, and the separate control on the right is checked.
Employers will want people with 5 years experience in core in about 2 years. Joking aside, it's just replacing the .NET Framework. Eventually you'll probably have to use it unless you're retired in the next 2 years or you work at a company that rarely upgrades their development platform.
 If you're using rest, yes, just use ocelot. It's very simple to setup and it's trusted/used by a lot of companies, which means it's production hardened. However, as you mentioned GraphQL, no, you don't need ocelot. Ocelot does well at forwarding requests, which you don't do in GraphQL. If you're wanting to use GraphQL, just write a regular web service with the post url accept and split the request schema to the respective microservices, ocelot won't help with any of that. The most used graphql library for dotnet is just [GraphQL-Dotnet](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet), which I've used and works very well and has a nice [conventions library](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/conventions) that allows you to write descriptive code.
Swagger is a documentation engine, it will not help you build the gateway. It makes it easier for others to understand how to use your API.
Some things not mentioned by the other comment.. 5. Microsoft put of a feeler on python support in future versions, no idea where that landed 6. I work in finance so we're 100% forced to work with Excel. We use ExcelDNA to run a ton of c# code in excel.
[ASP.NET Core Vue Template](https://github.com/danijelh/aspnetcore-vue-typescript-template) I am preparing 1.0.0 release of .NET Core multi-page template integrating Vue as a multiple mini spa's within razor. There's also a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@danijelhdev/multi-page-net-core-with-vue-js-typescript-vuex-vue-router-bulma-sass-and-webpack-4-efc7de83fea4)
&gt; VBA can't make its mind up about whether it wants the syntax to be statically or dynamically typed, That's a benefit for macro languages. Data in cells aren't going to be statically typed.
&gt; nor can it maintain any consistency about whether it uses 1-indexed or 0-indexed things like arrays and collections. Hate to break or to you, but it's worse than that. Arrays can have any starting index. This can be useful, say for an array that runs from 1997 to 2017. If you don't like that... well too bad. Excel automation is based on COM so you are stuck with non- standard array indexes no matter which language you choose. 
[WmiSharp](https://github.com/lzinga/WmiSharp) \- I learned about another library after I made this but still doesn't hurt to have another i'd say. It was also my first time adding a package with nuget which I think is awesome, even if for my own personal libraries that I don't think anyone could find useful.
What would a modern macro language look like? Certainly not C# or another C inspired language. Too much ceremony and legacy cruft for the casual programmer. Probably it would look like modern VB, minus the clear mistakes such as ON ERROR and using + for string concatenation. 
same reason they don't do a lot of things that a company of their size could conceivably do: backward compatibility with data and scripts created by older versions in use by millions of high-value customers &amp;#x200B;
I downloaded vs2019 and set it up for blazor, tried to build with out changing anything and it had errors. I am **very** excited for Blazor even though its still pretty early in its development.
Because *fuck Excel*.
FU VBA is awesome. \+ Strong or weak type \+ Compiles directly to p-code \+ Built for applications/integration \+ Lightning fast \+ Handles literally any object you could want it to. I mean I wouldn't write a standalone app with VBA but it's fucking awesome for outlook access and excel.
All of those are good reasons to keep VBA... but they're not good reasons to not add other options such as C#. And sure, Excel is mature and not having features added regularly... but it's also not going to disappear in the near future either. It's nowhere near dead.
I guess I have lot to learn about vba and excel. Thank you for the response.
I'd wager it's pretty difficult to add a second in-app scripting option. Microsoft already did the next best thing: [VSTO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/create-vsto-add-ins-for-office-by-using-visual-studio?view=vs-2017).
I suggest you to utilize this [Excel](https://www.officecomponent.com/products/excel) library. It is very easy to use and have great resource. You can easily spread sheets into .csv file by using it.
Becsuse Micro$oft ia the shittiest company in Earth... with the possible exception of Facebook.
I would love Microsoft to release Excel 2 that has minimal backwards compatibility. Streamline it, make it more of a database type application, and use C#/SQL. Like Access + Excel but actually good. It will never happen. 
Use [ExcelPro](https://www.officecomponent.com/products/excel) third-party library for c#.You can easily use it to write code for read excel, sort and write records.
They did. It's called Power Query and it uses the [M language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/power-query-m-reference)
If microsoft decides to use (or add) another to excel, I think it would be JS (or ts) rather than C#... because then the macros work in excel online too
Check out unknowncheats.me there's plenty of guides there that should help you out
why are you trying to cast? this is what would be a simple way to do this for an WPF/WinForms app, though same concepts: you have a Type collection, that is initialized somewhere else: public ObservableCollection&lt;Type&gt; ModelTypes { get; } and the selected ModelType is stored into this property: public Type SelectedModelType { get { return _selectedType; } set { if (value != _selectedType) { _selectedType = value; NotifyPropertyChanged(nameof(SelectedModelType)); } } } and the xml you want to deserialize in another property: public string ModelXml { get { return _modelXml; } set { if (value != _modelXml) { _modelXml= value; NotifyPropertyChanged(nameof(ModelXml)); } } } then you can deserialize like so: var xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(SelectedModelType); try { object model; using (var reader = new StringReader(ModelXml)) { model= xmlSerializer.Deserialize(reader); } } catch (Exception ex) { // do something with exception (show error dialog to user) } The model class may require annotations (attributes) for the serializer, if the model type (or properties within it) are abstract/interfaces Types.
*ring ring* "Hello?" "Hello. This is 1995 calling..." Oh, it's for you.
Spreadsheets and databases have two very different purposes. Sadly many office worker type people abuse the hell out of Excel to make it try to do database-like things....poorly 
\`using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel\`
&gt; get off their lawn with your fancy objects and structured programming. I started out with VBA, realized pretty much immediately how fucking trash the language is, but it works well with office products. Two years later I come back with C# experience and I try to automate some more stuff with OOP structure as a mindset. It's actually possible but holy hell - the VBA IDE fights you every step of the way. Error handling?
Fucking awesome? I'd describe it more like "it gets the job done" or "adequate."
That's exactly what I'm talking about 
I’d wager it’s not.
Adding C# support doesn’t mean removing VBA.
 The instant you crack open VBA in excel and code business logic, you've lost the game, from a business perspective. This is one reason why VBA is stagnant; it's not a Best Practice for businesses. If you see someone writing VBA code in excel, you should set their feet on fire, metaphorically speaking. It is almost *always* bad for the company. Data needs to live in databases, not in 50 copies of the same spreadsheet that get passed around. Which brings us to Power BI, which lets you properly maintain business systems while still providing the familiar excel interface. The business reason VBA is stagnant is because using it, or any scripting in excel, is a Bad Practice. To be clear, if your company is using Excel spreadsheets to contain business logic, that is a failure on the part of the IT team, the CTO and everyone above him. The same goes for any data that lives in a spreadsheet instead of a database. The vast majority of a CTO's job is to identify exactly that sort of Bad Practice and eliminate it. By extension, it is an IT department's job to do the same.
Well I mean yeah. It makes me feel like a wizard writing in an arcane, incomprehensible script
I'd vote for typescript. I loved working with it.
/r/lostRedditors
Excellent. This looks like it's what I'm needing. I'll give this a try on Monday. Thanks to all.
&gt;So *why* hasn't Microsoft done anything to replace VBA in Excel? Most likely because of the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of VBA macros that have been written by who-knows-how-many customers over the last 25 years. They aren't broke, so why fix them? There would be no benefit, and a lot of risk, of rewriting them all in C#. End users don't care how they were written, as long as they work. If you want to use C#, take a look at [Visual Studio Tools for Office](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/visual-studio-tools-for-office-runtime-overview?view=vs-2017). &amp;#x200B;
*laughs in open office* https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Scripting/Scripting_Framework
As for automating Office products - I'm currently using COM objects. If you have the application installed then you can reference the type library in Visual Studio and call the C++ code from C# It works, but it's tacky. If your app crashes then the invisible processes keep running in the background with the file open. And the processes constantly steal window focus, even if you do all you can to make them not behave like that, so you can browse reddit while you wait for the process to complete - the browser will constantly lose focus. The only real option, I think, is to make a proper [Office addin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/walkthrough-creating-your-first-vsto-add-in-for-excel?view=vs-2017) so you can access it within Excel. Yes, it's still COM, but it's way less tacky than invisible processes that you cross your fingers will release all their resources when your function exits.
User: "don't worry, I'm just testing something, it's not business critical, just makes my life easier" [5 years later] CEO: "OMG! Why is everything broken and why isn't IT fixing this excel macro ?!?"
Why Threads of Tasks?
At least VBA's Round() function uses banker's rounding. Excel's =ROUND formula always rounds away from zero.
You can still reference windows apis via the compatibility package if that is all you need and you will still get the full benefits for the core runtime. Although it isn't like that will magically make them work on Linux as they are still windows apis.
&gt; The only real option, I think, is to make a proper Office addin so you can access it within Excel. Yes, it's still COM, but it's way less tacky than invisible processes that you cross your fingers will release all their resources when your function exits. Yep. I suppose in theory you could bundle Roslyn into your addin and get the ability to execute snippets against Excel like in regular macros.

Starting with Excel 2016, you can use JavaScript to write add-ins, but the API is so limited you can barely do anything with it. I think if they were serious about that effort, we would have seen something more by now. The Excel Product Team did an AMA last November [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9uqzrs/we_are_the_microsoft_excel_team_ask_us_anything/), and Python support seems to be the most popular request. The Excel team couldn't make any commitments, but said any announcements would be made on the related [UserVoice topic](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language).
You can already somewhat use C# instead of VBA... 
I thought they were added Python 
Backwards compatibility, people would lose their shit if their VBA suddenly stopped working and people writing excel macros are rarely professional programmers, unlikely to learn another language.
that baconatorizor thing looks... interesting
I'm reading Xamarin In Action, it uses MvvmCross. I haven't used anything else to compare it with, but the author mentions it's one of the best out there. It works with WPF, UWP and Xamarin.

&gt; ExcelDNA Huh. Gonna have to check this out. Thanks!
&gt; It’s leaner, It comes with most of the existing .net framework, which isn’t. &gt; and designed for async off the bat. It comes with most of the existing .net framework, which mostly isn’t. &gt; But it is a large change From what? From 4.2.7? Not really, not right now. I find them very similar right down to exactly the same language. &gt; eventually you’ll be a dinosaur if you don’t learn it. Yeah yeah sure.. speak for yourself.
And not so ancient things like the entirety of WCF. 
&gt; You can still reference windows apis via the compatibility package Windows C++ APIs maybe, but not WCF.
&gt; Eventually you’ll probably have to use it unless you’re retired in the next 2 years or you work at a company that rarely upgrades their development platform. While I also like to use it, you are misrepresenting how businesses work. It’s not about “rarely upgrading” as if it’s because they don’t want to, it’s about the huge effort it might take to change a million line system into another platform that might not support the APIs you need. 
Many people starting off with VBA in Excel share your opinion, but then reality creeps in along with its 25 years of historical baggage. There's even bugs in Excel that cannot be fixed due to the fact that many people rely on the side effects or erroneous values generated by them in their macros. Microsoft's philosophy tends to skew heavily toward not rocking the boat for developers. This is why you end up with API calls with names CreateRemoteLocalHandleSomewhatSpeedilyExW with a parameter list a dozen structs long. Learning how to leverage COM is worthwhile, as it's still widely used in Windows. It's been around for over 25 years, and its method of IPC and componentisation is underpinning of all manner of Windows components and other Microsoft software, like WinRT, DirectX, VBA, OLE (shudder), the shell, IE, MFC, WMI, to name but a few.

Sure, but from the OP &gt;I get it that I can access an excel spreadsheet from within a c# application, but the people who use excel for a living often aren't real developers, and I think there's a real use-case for modernizing excel macros.
Serverside no, clientside is open source
If they've architected right with discreet services it won't be do bad. If it's a shop that builds monoliths that's their own fault.
Sorry for being a bit smart ass about it. I just think your post was pretty exaggerated about the current state of netcore.
Yeah *now* you can say that, but they are plenty of monoliths around from 10 years back.
Right.. I mean, open source isn’t really the point, availability is, more. But yeah, client side is there, true. 
Heres is some sample output: x1: 5, x2: 2, y1: 2, y2: 4 This produces the number 0. 
I don't disagree with the point you're making about the importance of a "Single Source of Truth" but disabling VBA doesn't stop that, it just stops the automation of it by clerical workers. As long as Excel is available you're still going to have the problem of people using it as a data store, with or without VBA.
&gt; I get it that I can access an excel spreadsheet from within a c# application Could also be powershell. 
Existing RoutedCommand are flawed by definition when using MVVM as you need to register the command with a UI type, either coupling your handlers with the UI, or coupling your ViewModel logic with the presence of WPF library types. Just use the boilerplate [RelayCommand](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/20c06b/icommand-and-relaycommand-in-wpf/), or Install-Package Prism.Wpf and use the DelegateCommand (basically same idea as RelayCommand) That will allow you to make normal properties you can databind your buttons to.
One word: Prism
What about it do you find arcane exactly? I'm genuinely curious. It's got a lot of things that people might find "quirky", but I think these are largely a product of its age. The language draws heavily upon BASIC and all that entails, sure, but the APIs were excellently documented, and the barrier to entry for VB (before .NET) and VBA has always been exceptionally low. 
Have you figured out why every single framework implements their own navigation system? I never used the built-in navigation functionality, but why isn't it good enough?
ExcelDNA +1. A wonderful piece of software. You can write your own UDF as well. Supports the full .NET Framework.
isn’t that msaccess?
Python, JavaScript, or PowerShell are the only viable options. F# if we're dreaming. Python/JavaScript - ubiquitous and commonly known by non-software-engineering coders. PowerShell - It's what Windows uses for scripting and exists on dotnetcore now, so maybe it could be made to work cross-platform in Office? F# - A modern, powerful language with access to the full .Net framework. The Functional paradigm flows naturally into Excel use cases. It already has a scripting/interpreted implementation.
They did. It's called Access. And then they made it not suck, and renamed it SQL Server.
Haven't Microsoft tried for ages to create and facilitate the possibility to create these sorts of apps? "Now even sales can customize their own something something productivity" Never catches on, cause it's still *work*, and you gotta *learn* stuff.
I think JS would win over TS just because of the dynamic nature of Excel data. However, modules implemented written in TS should work just fine in a JS context.
You’re over generalising there. VBA isn’t the problem there, that’s code whereas you’re talking about a data problem. You can have VBA and data from databases, a single source of truth (and other data sources), both being used in Excel.
I won't miss both of them. Remoting is an child of its time with his inbreed cousins of AppDomain and MarshalByObjRef but WCF is an overarchitected mess IBM would be proud of it. Tons of config, no IoC, a layer cake without any need
You can technically use any language you want, so long as it understands COM automation.

I wish that they would just add .NET support and VS Code's language interpreter. Then we could use VB, python, c#, or whatever. 
The F# syntax is way too esoteric. Remember that most people are going to be recording keystrokes and modifying to suit. Even JavaScript is pushing it, but at least instructional material is easy to find and it is dynamically typed. *** As far as being "modern", both JS and F# bring a lot of baggage that I wouldn't expect in a new language designed with intent. I don't know PS well enough to have an opinion. 
M is hardly a scripting language. It's a query syntax, I'm not sure if it's even Turing complete, and I don't thing it can do much within an Excel sheet, just in a query.
Yuck.
Caliburn.micro!
&gt; The F# syntax is way too esoteric. Yeah. That's why I put "if we're dreaming" in the first bit. It's a near-perfect domain fit, but just not accessible enough to the existing crop of Excel users. &gt; As far as being "modern", both JS and F# bring a lot of baggage that I wouldn't expect in a new language designed with intent. Designing a new language "with intent" is a great way to build a field of dreams that nobody ever actually uses. VBA was Visual Basic, and had the advantage of nothing being entrenched and there being no alternative.
IDK for like 40$ its the MUST BUY book for any C# dev professionally IMO If you do unity for fun, maybe not, but if you are trying to make games and get paid/publsih them professionally, might be worth it.
Some say even "books" made this way can last for centuries! Then they can be digitized to be lost in the nether bit rot void!
I disagree with your suggestion that VBA users are not real developers. At our company we write whole applications with VBA - it's a very powerful tool. Niche developers maybe, but "not real" is verging on offensive. 
VBA is a nightmare. You end up spending a bunch of time writing functions that do the most basic stuff. Who wants to waste time writing a function to determine if a file path exists or not?
I mean, I've dealt with the pain of using VBA for file manipulation but nine times out of ten I use it for something native to microsoft office, the second I need to do something outside of office I jump to another language. 
It's not simply a data problem. The problem is two-pronged. One is about where and how the data is stored. The other is about how the data is used by the business. Regarding the second, part of the problem is code management. The code isn't under source control, so in some cases, one person's mistake (or death) can lose it. You could loosely categorize this as siloing. Another part is that business processes are hidden from the company, which might still fall under siloing, but is really a bit broader in scope, because it potentially has SOX ramifications. Related to the fact that the business processes are hidden, they aren't *verified,* which is also a legal liability, because the company won't be able to prove due diligence if it needs to. When SOX auditors (internal or external) come do an audit of IT, *this is what they are looking for.* If they fail to dig through spreadsheets and ding departments for any excel spreadsheet that has grown into a business process, you need to consider a different auditing company (or retrain/remove them if they are internal.) The single greatest indicator that a spreadsheet has grown into a business process is the presence of scripts. It's like "code smell," but for a whole business.
"Just a query" that has navigatable steps that can be reused on other datasources, where the can have any sort of data massaging you would do in Excel, only power query virtualizes the data so that excel doesn't even break a sweat regardless of data size. Sure, you can't create an application by trying to use it as a programming language, but then the question it what kind of sorcery are you trying to achieve in VBA that necessitate it in the first place, and couldn't be better solved by either an addin or standalone application. For data wrangling and massaging, power query is superior in every way.
Easiest way: Use Update method and be sure the company has the ID (key) set. 
I'm not sure how having discrete services helps when APIs are not supported. At my company, the most important part of the code **needs** .NET Framework APIs (in `Reflection.Emit`) for which there are currently no plans in .NET Core. We can't throw it away, we can't migrate : at this rate, we'll still need to support .NET Framework five years from now.
I said "often", and I stand by it. There are exceptions as I knew full well when I said it.
&gt;What do I have to do differently because of it? Nothing. 
&gt; Reflection.Emit what's that
Typescript or lua would both be good fits. 
$20 on "not".
If anyone can make a run at it then it would be Microsoft. There's a lot of weight behind Office. And from what I hear, Go is doing well.
We have a domain-specific language that emits optimized IL at runtime . There are two ways to generate IL in C#: - Using `System.Linq.Expression` to describe an expression tree, which can then be compiled to a delegate. - Using `System.Reflection.Emit` to create a new assembly, a new type and a new method, and generate the IL for that method's body. The first approach is supported by .NET Core (and is how many common libraries, such as serializers, create specialized code just-in-time), but it has limits on what it can achieve (in particular, it cannot define new types, implement interfaces, etc). The second approach is significantly more flexible, and is almost completely supported by .NET Core, the main problem is that, to debug the generated code, the most effective way is (as is always the case for code generation) to save the assembly as a .dll and use PEVerify, ILVerify, dotPeek and similar tools to inspect/decompile your IL. Sadly, .NET Core does not and will not support saving assemblies, which means the only way to retain our ability to debug our code generation is to keep .NET Framework support.
Yeah, I’ve used WCF a lot which makes it much easier to deal with, but yeah it’s flexible but definitely over engineered. Where I work now, we use it a lot so we can’t easily switch to core. Purely done in code, no config needed, by the way. 
I'm not taking any shots at power query here, I do think it's a powerful tool. But it's in no way a replacement for VBA as a general scripting language for Excel. 
Or just For Each and forget about indexes.
As someone who's constantly writing VBA junk in excel to accomplish fairly large projects- I actually think vba isn't a terrible kicking off point. No it's not nearly as powerful as C# and what not, but for very simple things I think it's a LOT easier for a layman to learn. Loop syntax comes to mind as something that comes to mind. ``` For i = 1 to 40 stuff next i``` is a hell of a lot more layman friendly than ```for(int i = 1; i &lt;= 40; i++) { stuff }``` I'm someone who got into programming through vba/excel on the "there's got to be a better way to do this" train of thought, and while I can see now how VERY useful a real language is, and why such things are done, as a beginner who was just trying to reverse engineer the macro recorder code while pouring through pearson documentation, I found vba's readability a godsend. 
They did a new JS based addin system project for Excel Online. Not sure how it went.
Powershell is cross platform. Has been for a while.
TypeScript is certainly better than Javascript, but it still has a lot of rules to remember like semi colon placement. BASIC was chosen in part because it is case insensitive and has realatively little syntax that needs to be explained. Teaching a for loop in C based languages is hard because it looks scary and has a weird syntax.
I'll just say that as someone working at a company where the CTO/IT team don't even know what a database is or does(basically), the ability has been a godsend. I'm now setting up full SQL databases to get a datawarehouse going with some consultant help, but we're a company that does a billion in gross revenue a year and our IT wouldn't even be leading edge in '99. Point being that there's MANY companies out there that don't even understand just how horrible it is to do this sort of shit, but at the end of the day the ability to do it still keeps them productive enough, and allows the few like me who get it to start showing off what COULD be done, and start walking them down the road to sanity....sorta.
They could replace the system with C# or something similar and do a conversion of VBA to C# when such code is entered and prompt to upgrade existing projects. The language isn't that complex that it would be hard to make a converter for it.
You never worked with Caren who fucking kill you if you ruin her bob macros.
I hope it gets replaced by PowerShell
No way! They bought sql server from Sybase in the 80s. When they were working on os2. They bought access in the 90s some time. 
ReactiveUI
The editor itself is pretty arcane, in appearance anyway. It functions well enough - breakpoints, watches, stepping, etc. It just looks super old, throwing a vs/vs code look on it would make it feel way more modern. Note: I don't know if such a thing already exists, and I haven't developed VBA in a couple years now.
Ostensibly, I think it would make more sense to go with VB.NET than C#, simply because the old paradigm is VB. Even then, adding support for a new language in addition to an old language is actually a lot of work. Windows has to do this kind of thing all the time, and it is a huuuuuge pain in the ass to engineer, let alone get right. You don't just slap on the new thing and leave the old thing in - there are all sorts of dependencies and things under the hood that would have to be updated regardless. Adding .NET support would be huge - but also a huge amount of work in and of itself - making all that also backward compatible with VBA? I think you'd have to come up with a really compelling business case for that to go anywhere. tl;dr backward compatibility... 
Removed: Spam.
That makes sense I guess. I came to vba from the opposite direction, and compared to modern, mature programming languages vba looks like the redheaded stepchild. When I started with it I saw a language that has some syntax it shares with many other languages I've worked with, meanwhile lacking the consistency those other languages have. Its fucking weird and I could probably rant for a solid 20 minutes about the weird inconsistent syntax despite only having spent about an hour writing with it casually. These answers are really helpful, though, because I'm starting to understand the value and reasons behind vba.
I wrote my own, works great 
Don't get me started on this trend for "zero code" BS. Take MS Power Apps for example. Yeah you can easily wire up an app to an ERP or CRM system. Problem is it'll be against their live environment. No fucking way I'll touch that without adequate sandboxing in a non production environment. No version control / DevOps workflow. Good luck branching and merging your work from other team members. Your shitty drag and drop app has functions scattered all over the fucking place. Buried behind button events etc. No way to see your code as a cohesive whole. Everything is buried behind the UI. It's a massive step backwards that reminds me of the days of visual basic 6 (yes I've been coding for that long). Zero-code is not intended for programmers. 
Thanks
&lt;serious&gt; I do have a strong sentimental attachment to paper books, and own somewhat more than my fairly small condo can accommodate. But the advantages of digital books are too great to not making them part of my life too. Having immediate access to hundreds of books wherever I have a digital device, searching within books, and last but not least, instant gratification when I want to get a new book. But I agree that the fragility of digital information is something we should take more seriously. The threat of a "digital dark age" is real. &lt;/serious&gt;
ReactiveUI
&gt;Office.js This was going to be my reply. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office)
And MacOS. Linux is obviously more relevant for servers but MacOS is more relevant for dev machines.
Should be PowerShell
Look at Visual Studio and SQL community editions. They are free and Microsoft virtual academy has some great learning tools. There are plenty of good free leaning videos out there also &amp;#x200B;
I think that's what you need: https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatNETDevelopersOughtToKnowToStartIn2017.aspx
Try making a slope variable that is of type float. Might need to cast the ints as floats to do the math with them.
&gt; vs/vs code look on it Just because it's old doesn't mean it's hard to use. Most of the people writing VBA aren't developers. And for what it's worth, it does have a VS look :) It's based off MSVS 6 which shipped the last version of VB in 1998. 
I did what you said and it worked! Thanks for the advice. Here is the code BTW: https://pastebin.com/HmQ2aQXD
99% seems accurate, but I have no empirical evidence for that. ;)
After further testing, I have discovered that it often outputs the wrong answer, especially when using negative integers. Any ideas? For example: x1:-2, X2:5, Y1:-7, Y2:3 produces m = 1.428...
It paves the way for projects like CoreRT that turn C# into native code opens up quite a lot of doors like applicstions running on embedded hardware etc.
Just dynamically assign the starting point of your array. Name a variable for the index and print it in the stack to detect the starting point. Then you have your "zero."
I agree, I didn't find the IDE difficult to use, just not pretty. It's relatively trivial. Haha, so its old enough to drink, then! 
There are only 3 classes you need to implement: ViewModel (the base class that implements INotifyPropertyChanged), Command (that implements ICommand) and Messenger (used to send messages between different view models). As a helper for view models I use the Fody.PropertyChanged nuget. It allows you to define auto properties (without backing field and without raising the PropertyChanged event - it's done automatically). This really cuts down on the amount of boilerplate you have to write.
 Option Base 0
Exactly. We are still targeting Windows XP. 
Are they going to kill it off in .net standard as well? That would the brakes on moving over.
That looks right to me. What answer are you expecting? I should have been asleep about three hours ago, so my math could be fuzzy. Check (https://youtu.be/hsbuBzujUYg)[this] out.
Ya I looked into it some more, I'm definitely getting one to switch between programming and music/video recording.
There are couple of ways you can deal with it. If you want to add brand new product, then don't add full company, just add company id, for example do p.CompanyId=2. That should work. But if you think logically, you are adding product to a company not a product with company. So what you can do is, get a company from context, then do company.Products.Add(product). Hope this helps
And what if I want for example execute a command when user is moving his Mouse over a button? 
Time is valuable, I'd switch jobs to work in something modern instead of waiting for MS to modernize Excel. 
Not every office has an in-house programmer, but EVERYBODY can understand VBA and write macros for it There's really no need to add significant bloat by introducing a new programming language I to it that fewer people can use.
That's so wrong in every single way Excel is the best program of its type, it's not old, everybody uses it for their spreadsheets, no matter what age they are. VBA is the easiest language to use. Not every office has a programmer, but they all have somebody who can write a VBA macro after a couple of hours learning.
Maybe I don’t understand it, but if you are really needing advanced functionality why are you relying on excel and not Sql Server, dapper, and closed xml to create your .xlsx? 
Lol how would switching to a Mac solve any of this? Hint it wouldn’t. 
This. A millions times this. Spreadsheets are not data stores. Use a database. Need to view data? Stop using excel and use Tableau. 
That was the reason I installed squirrel.... 
I'd argue linux is more relevant to dev machines, since you're likely running Windows and Docker for Windows, and Docker for Windows works by spinning up a Linux vm if it's not using Windows containers (and you're probably not using Windows containers).
Everything you said here is completely incorrect and I sincerely hope that you’re not in a position where you’re making any critical decisions. “If you see someone writing VBA code in excel, you should set their feet on fire, metaphorically speaking. It is almost always bad for the company. Data needs to live in databases, not in 50 copies of the same spreadsheet that get passed around.” Yes, critical data should be stored in a database. However, VBA is not a database and has nothing to do with housing data in a spreadsheet. Are you suggesting that every single thing a user enters into a spreadsheet be entered into a database instead? “Single Source of Truth, and that should never be a spreadsheet, EVER. Which brings us to Power BI, which lets you properly maintain business systems while still providing the familiar excel interface” Joe the plumber might record his business transactions in Excel. However, assuming we’re on the subject of established corporations since you mentioned IT audits, 98% of the data that lives in spreadsheets came from a report ultimately stored in database. What is the point in having data if it can’t be used for analysis by end users whether it pushed into Power BI, Excel, or any other spreadsheet/local BI application? Which brings me to my next point. writing a script to automate a task such as fetching data from said database using VBA is no different than using Power BI to fetch and manipulate the same dataset. Both tools can be used to accomplish the same job of pulling data from a database. “To be clear, if your company is using Excel spreadsheets to contain business logic, that is a failure on the part of the IT team, the CTO and everyone above him.” Logic is a set of principles that drives a specific process. Whether that logic is driven by VBA, c#, Python, or Karen’s fingertips doesn’t make a shit bit of difference as they’re just tools with the common goal of automating a repetitive task. 
FileSystemObject.fileexists(path) That took like a whole 5.3 seconds. 
That’s what I meant by over generalising. A lot of business processes don’t go through that level of audit and might not be involved in finance and SOX at all. And I’ve even seen where the audit would have preferred any code because it fulfils having a repeatable and documented process rather than an ad-hoc process that only Jim in Finance can do. Like all things it depends on the situation. Of course I wouldn’t want a crucial business process that has significant risk to be automated without software developers being involved. But who’s to say the marketing department can’t do their own sums for their own report? Or that Mike in HR who recorded a macro to add special formatting to their charts shouldn’t do that. It’s unrealistic to think all business processes need to go through a full development process just because someone might have written a little code. Usually a good review of the output by another subject matter expert is fine - just like if there was no code written at all.
yes,java and c# are basically identical syntax wise and they both obey OOP principles so if you know c# you won't jave many problems with java.
They didn't though. Everything they said is correct. The bcl's has been massively changed, which gives a big performance increase straight away. Common classes like List have been reimplemented with performance in mind. It's better by pretty much every metric and cross platform. A load of features from c# 8 will be core only. That alone should show you how things are going.
NOT known with it. But I heard they added JavaScript support I to excel. Unsure how it works though. 
The "save to assembly" methods are not part of .NET Standard, but you can keep your code in .NET Standard and run it in .NET Framework when debugging. This does prevent you from using anything that is not supported by .NET Framework. But in discussions of .NET Framework versus .NET Core, I find that .NET Standard just adds unnecessary complexity anyway.
&gt; Microsoft isn't going to invest a crap-ton of money to change the scripting environment of a dead-end software package out from under its established (and paying!) user base. That's funny, because that is exactly what they're doing.
&gt;&gt; and designed for async off the bat. &gt; &gt; It comes with most of the existing .net framework, which mostly isn’t. Initially the left out the non-async methods where they don't make sense, but due to peer pressure they reintroduced those methods again.
Probably because C# 8.0 is not done yet. I love those books that are released for frameworks that are not even done yet, then these books are obsolete because things changed in the frameworks.
Especially on Android side. With iOS you can probably get by.
&gt; Probably it would look like modern VB, minus the clear mistakes such as ON ERROR and using + for string concatenation. ON ERROR in VBA/VB6 for sure... but VB has had the ampersand as a string concatenation operator since VB2.
VBA is pretty much Visual Basic 4-6 being used as an extensibility platform. The main difference, of course, is that VBA continued to be supported and developed for Office going forward. The likely reason for that, I suspect, is that Microsoft couldn't bring themselves to tell all the enterprise customers that relied on VBA that they were fucked, since they would just not upgrade to the new version because they always have some business critical thing in VBA/Excel or some weird hodgepodge of glue code between Access and Excel solutions.
Version 1 UUIDs are pretty trivial to generate these days, and will give you sequential ordering. Pretty much every programming language/platform have a defacto package for generating these types of UUIDs without having to roll your own code, these days. 
In short, java is identical to c# except on the following points (non exhaustive): Not on .net so different tooling No auto property No Linq Really long nomenclature Some weird details on pass by value vs pass by ref The rest you'll learn but that's the things I find most important in terms of language difference. 
Ah right. My stance that anything is a replacement for vba. Shutting down the computer and taking up woodworking is a proper replacement for vba.
Prism if your a traditionalist. ReactiveUI if you wanna use a modern Reactive programming approach (warning if you've never done Rx you're gonna struggle a bit before realising the power of ReactiveUI).
The c# and Java is pretty similar and the transition shouldn't be difficult. If you learned modern concepts mv-x, learning mvvm shouldn't be hard. Now when it comes to WPF and ide, that might be only things that will drain some of your time and even those are pretty simple (depends on the depth you will need) 
Yes that did the trick!! Thx!
It's such a strange hack, but it works xD
It's kind of related to how bool is processed in dotnet source code right?
Right.
&gt; They didn’t though. Everything they said is correct. Well, not in my experience. &gt; The bcl’s has been massively changed, which gives a big performance increase straight away. I didn’t argue against internal changes or performance increases. &gt; Common classes like List have been reimplemented with performance in mind. Sure. &gt; A load of features from c# 8 will be core only. I’d argue a few, since I don’t think C#8 has “a load” in total, but yes, I know. &gt; That alone should show you how things are going. Didn’t argue against that either. Did you guys read the same comment?
Oh, we’re deprecating Win 7 target soon, so it’s 4.7.2 with use of net standard packages. So not too bad :p. 
Set the click behavior on the button to hover.
Easiest to use how?
Thanks. Now it's more clear for me. 
Did not know this. That’s awesome!
Because running macros was a big mistake and nobody wants to touch lying shit. Hire real developers. 
There's a big difference between creating a pivot table vs. using vba to code out a business process. Excel has facilities to pull data from a database without resorting to vba to do it, and moreso, if the data has to be manipulated via vba to be useful, then really that manipulation should have happened before it reached the spreadsheet file. In a perfect world, data analysis would not happen in a spreadsheet. Sally from accounting would recognise the fact that she needs to be able to prove her data and she'd fire up RStudio rather than Excel so she can analyze data in a repeatable and provable way. Alas for Sally, and the company she works for. But since we don't live in a perfect world, we have to make sure Jim from HR doesn't pull some console cowboy vba nightmare off of Wikihow that neither he nor Sally understand to get Sally's job done for her. Because even if it somehow works today, business requirements change, and Sally just knows that when she presses that button, magic data pops out. Three years later, Jim has moved on and the password-protected vba code he wrote performs the wrong business logic. Sally has been further altering the data by hand because she recognized that it wasn't giving her what she needed, but what she's doing to the data is completely undocumented, because it's a business process that is not under any sort of change management. Change Management? Whatthehellisthat? Oh, did I mention? Sally just got ran over by a bus, so the company is screwed. This might be fictitious, but this kind of disastrous behavior is so common, I'd be amazed if I didn't just write someone's actual story.
I spent the last five years becoming comfortable with c# / WPF and build plugins for a niche market. I’m not a programmer by training but would like to transition to programming more general-purpose apps. Is there a technology or platform that you would recommend at this point ?
I agree, though I find that C# In Nutshell also provides great coverage of Linq. I guess that's appropriate for a book written by the creator of LinqPad! Overall I'd say that C# In a Nutshell is more comprehensive in covering every little detail of C#, whereas C# In Depth in more conceptual in its focus. They complement each other quite well in my opinion. I have an electronic copy of CLR Via C# that I've been neglecting. I've been hearing about it on here often enough that I may have to bite the bullet and start reading it too.
&gt; No Linq They have streams now, which is a poor mans versions of LINQ. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html
Pretty much. Java just feels like a more verbose C# for basic things today. Very easy to switch between. 
Agreed. It's impossible to keep track. MS documentation online is a much better resource. And keep getting updates. 
Is mvvm for wpf kind of like mvc for web stuff? Whats the benefit for mvvm wpf apps?
I'm curious. How's the stability of Excel with that. My company uses tons of VBA and SQL and excel crashes hard regularly. Vb7e.dll full on crashes. 
Even so e sport of Power Shell module integration like with 365 would be good enough
You say that like that stopped them abandoning vb6 which was the most used programming language in the world at the time 
Honestly I would determine the salary range you want to target and what makes you happy. Front End UI pays the worst but it can be the most satisfying as people can see your work.
- async/await - generics
I was to lazy to actually do the math. I was using an online slope calc. I suppose it is possible that the call is wrong.
There is a 3rd party add in to Excel which you can use in this way (I have used it before, but not for a couple of years) : &amp;#x200B; Add-in express for windows office &amp;#x200B; Not that this really answers your question, but I found it a reasonable workaround (I used it on msft project to import/export data) &amp;#x200B;
Yes, and lots of mistakes are avoided when you use &amp; instead of +. Even in C# I've seen bugs caused by using + for both. The same goes for overloading == to mean both value and reference equality. While always problematic, it gets worse in a dynamically typed scenario, which will be common for macros. 
I'm go into more detail when I get to a computer but it's great. The only instability I've had is due to mistakes in the C#
Mvvm is Just another design pattern like mvc. It Just helps with making maintainable apps. 
Well the vba instability above is mostly due to bad vba code, but alas I'm not responsible for their code.
The important thing is that the bad vba code crashes the book, while bad c# code will just return errors
That's music to my ears.
&gt; FileSystemObject.fileexists Ah that looks pretty reasonable. I think I was referring back to VB6.
Ok now that I'm at a computer I'll go over a few points in depth with Excel DNA other than the niceties of actually writing in C#. Being able to write your code in C# instead of VBA means a few things 1. You can hook in your proprietary logging/diagnostics much easier. You can catch every exception and log it then just return an excel error value. I never have crashes related to C#. 2. The version control offered with a C#/ExcelDNA setup is vastly superior to VBA. In VBA you have the version tied to the specific workbook and have to import/export modules. With ExcelDNA you just drop new DLLs in to the add-in. It doesn't matter if someone uses a copy of the workbook. 3. A big thing for us is you can have unit tests on the functions, so you know you're not breaking anything. VBA changes are sort of a crap-shoot. One thing I'd caution however is that ExcelDNA doesn't handle nullable types as inputs and excel treats every parameter as optional. So if you have a primitive input like double and the user doesn't fill it in, it comes in as a zero. This is tricky if you need different behavior for a zero and a null. However, if you make your input parameter a base object you can parse it and get full info on whether the input value was an error type, empty, etc. This also adds nice functionality like custom inputs in a broad sense. For example if you parse in the c# well, users can input f("3/1") and you can interpret it as if they input f(DATE(2019, 3, 1))
It's been a really long time, but I'm pretty sure we referenced something from VBA, and called the exact same function in VB6.
I'm the maintainer of NetVips. Here's a brief introduction on the use of the .NET binding: [https://kleisauke.github.io/net-vips/tutorial/getting\_started.html](https://kleisauke.github.io/net-vips/tutorial/getting_started.html) &amp;#x200B; I think you're looking for image pyramids. The libvips documentation has a chapter explaining how to make image pyramids: [http://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/Making-image-pyramids.md.html](http://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/Making-image-pyramids.md.html) &amp;#x200B; If you need further information, please let me know!
[NetVips](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips), the C# binding for [libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/). It's a lazy, streaming, demand-driven image processing library. I'm currently working on the 1.1.0 release of this library (due in a couple of weeks). The next release contains the pre-compiled libvips binaries for commonly used distros.
Thank you very much for the answer. I'm sold on ExcelDNA. 
You have a variable called counter that is never declared, why is it used? 
What about Roslyn and code evaluation? https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Scripting-API-Samples
Microsoft's documentation is generally excellent. There's also Pluralsight and Microsoft has some training material of their own.
I like [Jamie King](https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja/playlists?shelf_id=5&amp;view=50&amp;sort=dd), I watched all his C# videos when I was learning. His videos are short and sweet, and on point, but still manages to go in-depth.
I wonder how many struct foo { int x, int y } storage and throughput you'd need before this was a practical solution to this specific issue haha
He's probably writing an averager
I can't see why that wouldn't output 15 as expected. I suspect op is mistaken with the measurement of sum 
If you fix the couple of syntax errors so that it can at least compile, it works fine: https://i.imgur.com/bwassXt.jpg
Wouldn't it be faster to check if any aren't in the target? List1.Any(x =&gt; !list2.Contains(x)) Or something? Will be much faster if list2 is a hashSet too. Sorry about capitalisation etc, on phone
Thanks! Bought it with this code :)
That will never compile are you sure you're not running an old build? Try "= new int \*\*\[\]\*\* {" and most people use \`foreach(var v in arr) { sum+= v; }\`. Actually most people would simply write \`var sum = arr.Sum()\` 
You could look up git submodules and build all repetitive code into a classlib? Im not sure as what you intend to do,but thats how I'd approach it. Sadly,Im in a same pickle as you and this solution sits at the bottom of my very long todo list,so I can't help too much. Until someone comes here with better idea,look up submodules. Either way ,Im too ,interested in other solutions for same issue and would like to hear how other people would/do solve it!
Ideally you would need to publish that code to Nuget packages, which you then consume across all of your own projects. How you do this, depends on whether you want that code / packages private or don’t mind other people using them. Personally, most of the generic code I write I don’t mind sharing on an MIT license. I use MyGet.org that has webhooks triggers from my Github projects. That triggers a CI build on MyGet and pushes the packages upstream to Nuget.org. If you want a private feed then obviously don’t publish them upstream. You can then add the Nuget feed into Visual Studio and consume you own private feed. You can also use Azure DevOps CI Pipeline as well which supports private feeds for up to 5 users. You can also have local feeds on your own machine as well. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview
That would be my approach too. Submodules is the way to go.
Why does this exist? Bragging about the number of tests doesn't mean anything if you can't first show why the ORM meets some need. Examples: * NHibernate handles deep object graphs * Entity Framework handles deep object graphs with better performance than NHibernate. * Dapper focuses on performance at the cost of no deep object graph support. * Tortuga Chain offers reflection over the runtime database schema, allowing for SQL generation not normally available without massive amounts of configuration. * MicroORM shows of VB/C#'s dynamic typing capabilities for academic purposes *** If you do exactly the same thing as another library, and that other library is known to be buggy, then test metrics matter. Otherwise no one is going to care.
When I first posted about RepoDb, people are looking for the tests. It seems to be the requirements. The library "may" not be stable without covering most scenarios. The reason why there are so many tests written in RepoDb, is that because it is now covering so many scenarios. May I ask you a question, have you ever tried look at the features of this library? If yes, then you might understand why do we need write much more tests.
@grauenwolf You are being unfair. This sort of work should absolutely be applauded and encouraged.
Source code: [https://github.com/JoaoBaptMG/PathRenderingLab](https://github.com/JoaoBaptMG/PathRenderingLab)
Publish a nuget package to a private feed (like "C:\MyNugetFeed") and reference your nuget package in the projects that need it. Do not use submodules as others have suggested. Do not add the project to a solution and use a project reference. Do not directly reference the DLL *file*. Build -&gt; .nupkg -&gt; private nuget feed -&gt; nuget reference.
I've no idea about how does writing an ORM looks like, but was difficult it to make Expression Trees to work?
https://dotnetfiddle.net/q69FNQ
It is not that difficult, but it is a bit tedious. Expression trees are one of the most time-consuming development (specially when doing a lot of compiled expressions).
C++ and Java are conceptually extremely similar, and syntactically they're sufficiently similar that being able to program one tends to let you read the other clearly.
What's that lambda / sql tab?
The UnityEngine will let you export and import packages that can be easily re-used between projects if that is your only need.
using System; using System.Reflection; using System.Collections.Generic; namespace GHM.FIFO.SPARTA.Utils.Reporting { class Person { public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public string City { get; set; } public string State { get; set; } } class ConsoleTest { public static void Main(string[] args) { var persons = new List&lt;Person&gt;(); persons.Add(new Person() { FirstName = "Joe", LastName = "Blow", City = "Los Angeles", State = "CA" }); persons.Add(new Person() { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe", City = "Charlotte", State = "NC" }); persons.Add(new Person() { FirstName = "Peter", LastName = "Piper", City = "San Antonio", State = "TX" }); printToConsole(persons); } public static void printToConsole(IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; persons) { var properties = typeof(Person).GetProperties(); printHeader(properties); foreach(var person in persons) { var field_values = new List&lt;string&gt;(); foreach(var property in properties) { field_values.Add(property.GetValue(person).ToString()); } var line = string.Join(",", field_values); Console.WriteLine(line); } } public static void printHeader(IEnumerable&lt;PropertyInfo&gt; properties) { var header = new List&lt;string&gt;(); foreach (var property in properties) { header.Add(property.Name); } var line = string.Join(",", header); Console.WriteLine(line); } } }
Take a look at Azure API gateways. You can also replace certain calls to your API with Azure functions, for example a GET request that gets called a lot (cheaper than the web app). https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/
For EF optimized bulk inserts check out EF Plus or Entity Framework Extensions. https://entityframework-plus.net
Hopefully this will help you.. To start I added the shared projects to each of the specific solutions within the same folder structure. This helps when your still building out the shared projects that haven't been stabilized yet. After they're mature then break them out into separate repositories and then reference them via nuget or bin reference. Don't know what your project looks like so sorry if this is redundant or anything. But what really works great for me is a solution with just POCO models. Then a solution with just utilities, helpers etc.., data layer solution, business layer solution (managers). Here is my repo with all the code in subfolders. https://github.com/bluesektor/TreeMon If you check it out, navigate to the service folder to the web app solution. You can see how all the sub projects are added. You can then look in the clients folder, i believe the solution is treemon.client. This is a Windows forms project that references the same core projects as the API (code reused! Yay!). I broke them in separate repositories (private), which represent the major projects i.e. services, mobile client, forms client. I could break them down even further for each solution but it may be a little confusing. Cheers. 
Looks like LINQPad.
Don't even pay attention to him. He is always promoting his own ORM solution and shitting on anything else. Really likes the smell of his own asshole. You triggered him. And I love you for that.
I think he wanted to point out that you should advertise features of your code and not how many unit tests you have. Because unit tests are nothing that I am consuming as nuget consumer. So your advertisement could be: “Almost as fast as dapper but with the flexibility of EF and some additional features.” Currently the only feature you advertise is that you have unit tests. Also unit tests are a necessity and not a feature from my POV and in my company we often follow TDD/BDD approaches where this amount of unit tests is not unusual or for a whole service rather on the lower end. And much more important than the number of unit tests is code coverage. And much more important than code coverage (but also really hard to track) is the number of untested code paths. Also I would say for such a package the two most important parts are usability and performance. I looked quickly through your documentation but usability looked rather familiar and performance is missing some nice graphs to make a better impression. You are fighting against some big players. I wish you the best on that journey.
Consider using CQRS. It helps you think about this kind of thing. Imagine you have an API that takes the upload. The API is responsible for checking that the type of the file is allowed, that the size of the HTTP request isn’t too big etc. You inject a command into that API controller say AddFileCommand. It takes a request that contains the basic data about the file from the upload and the file contents as a byte array or a MemoryStream. I prefer streams because bytes arrays moved between different layers of an app keep on herring copied and recreated. You command has a FileRepostory injected and responsible for saving the file data to the database. Use DDD with an aggregate root called File or StorageFile of you don’t want to continuously choose between your object and System.IO! Any Bau was logic concerning the file itself, goes in there. For example, if you have rules that different file types have different file size permissions then do that there. If you need to process the file later then you’d call a method MarkAsPending() to set the processing status and the date for example. It also has a FilesystemService injected which is responsible for saving the file bytes/stream somewhere. This could be a provider so you can save the file locally to disk for development or to Azure blob storage / Rackspace File for your remote storage in production. You probably want to run everything in a transaction and on any failure you rollback any database changes or file writes. 
You’re basically talking about replication. There are a number of solutions out there for SqlLite replication. 
The features are documented well in the 'readthedocs', and the people of 'reddit' is annoyed of me sharing that to them before. Someone even saw code-smell on RepoDb which I fixed a month after. I posted this it's because it is not easy to write and cover most of the scenarios. My library is getting big, and I hope you felt the same way. If you notice 'RepoDb' memory utilization, that is something that need *NOT* to get ignored. Remember that this library has a massive ORM features that you do not need to write your own SQL, but still managed to maintain the performance and efficiency of the memories. A bit hybrid as per our Enterprise Architect (Technical). I personally disagree with you in the TDD/BDD approach. We use Specflow as Regression Test, but we still **need** to write Unit/Integration Test. This test is very necessary to ORM library, as this is testing the **features** and the same time **integrity** of the data.
My personal favorite library for this is ServiceStack.Text on Nuget Then you can do: ``` var myComplexObject = someRepository.Get(); Console.Write(myComplexObject.Dump()); ``` And it dumps it out to JSON. 
If you’re using NInject then make sure HttpClient is objected as a singleton. Then watch out for these gotchas: https://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/08/2016-08-27-httpclientwrong/
If you want to have a method that takes a bunch of arrays and finds duplicates between them but also needs the name of the array(s) where the duplicate(s) exist then you could use a dictionary of type &lt;string, int[]&gt;. The string key of the array being its name. 
This is probably one of the most useful things I've come across, and I'm super excited about this once it goes full release
The download part is pretty easy. Either use HttpClient or WebClient or my personal favorite RestSharp to download the contents of the GitHub file. Then to execute the Powershell script on that content, you’d need to do something like this described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11120452/run-powershell-script-from-c-sharp-application Make sure you set the execution policy as that can catch people out since the app might be running with different permissions to what you expect. 
Are you talk g about getting a distinct list of companies? If so System.Linq is your friend. ``` var companies = new List&lt;string&gt; { “Microsoft”, “Dell”, “Oracle”, “Microsoft”, “Amazon” }; var distinctList = companies.Distinct(); ```
Dependencies are hierarchies. So you can create a circular reference if you tried to add a reference to a project that links to another one that has the circular reference. 
Perhaps I lack tact (ok, no perhaps about it) but this is what he needs to know if he wants to be taken seriously. I'm a journalist. It's my job to tell people about new libraries. But to do so I need a headline that's better than "has lots of tests" or none of my readers are going to pay any attention to it. 
Came here to say this. Single responsibility principal. IdentityServer4 is awesome. 
This isn't about me. If I were jealous I wouldn't tell him how to promote his library. Yes, I'm proud of my work. But my job, as in how I make money, comes from promoting other people's work.
https://www.linqpad.net/ A must have tool if you work in .Net, imo
Curious, which ones were faster/slower?
Resharper for its lovely suggestions and NCrunch for continuous testing. 
He isn't trying to discredit the work involved (I hope, anyways). He wants to know why someone would consider using it. That's something I can't find by reading the website or in this Reddit post. It doesn't have an established user base and doesn't seem to enable any use cases that aren't covered by competitors. What benefits does it provide? Why should I remember the name and consider it for my next project?
Try the same request in Postman first to check you have the call correct. Now use whatever library you want to make the POST request in your app. Run both side by side with Fiddler in the background. You should see both requests and you can compare them. I do a lot of REST and SOAP integration work. This is my go to for fixing discrepancies between expected requests and actual requests. P.S. Fiddler takes a little setting up before you can log HTTP requests from console apps.
Maybe it's because nobody cares or/and it is not remarkable? :-) I have been using xunit and nunit - didn't saw the difference.
Yeah, I did end up figuring that out. I was trying to reference a proxy in my main project that references a service that references the main project. So really my only option was to move that part of the main project to it's own separate project. I should have realized it, but I was already exhausted from a crappy weekend that just compounded every day into an awful week. Stress plus not enough rest is a bad time.
I think the reason this information might not be as prevalent is because often times, when it comes to unit testing frameworks, performance is less important than feature set, usability, and integration features. I'd be interested to know the results myself. At my shop we used to use MSTest, and switched to xUnit a few years ago because we prefer the feature set and utilities. I'm not sure if FluentAssertions works with MSTest but we started using that around the same time and it's great.
This is exactly what I was thinking
This should give you a pretty good idea of how to use List.RemoveAll(): https://dotnetfiddle.net/CBQvvX
Glad you figured it out. I always separate generated code into a separate project so that it can be easily excluded from code coverage on the build server. I don’t want code coverage on Microsoft’s shitty code!
Which Castle repository? They have a number of useful things - a dependency injection (IoC) container, a runtime proxy generator (trap calls to code and replace/augment with your own code), they have an MVC framework for web applications and they have a utility/architecture library with logging and other cross cutting concerns. Useful stuff! Go read the github pages, they have documentation 
I ended up using C++ as I couldn't get C# to work, but thanks!
From reading your problem I think this might be because you have your entities 'eager loaded'. This basically means that when you load Model 1, the attached Model 2 entities will also be loaded completely. Now the above could be the cause of your problem, and disabling eager loading is very easy. You simply have to make the properties that define the relation virtual. Below your example code updated: class Model1 { int ID { get; set; } public virtual List&lt;Model2&gt; Models { get; set; } } class Model2 { int ID { get; set; } public int ParentModelId{ get; set; } [ForeignKey("ParentModelId")] public virtual Model1 ParentModel { get; set; } } I also added the property ParentModelId in Model2 since it seemed to be missing.
The git readme links to their docs, with their vision, goal, and feature list. It's the first one I can recall seeing with query hints, which is actually very interesting to me
No, but that doesn't matter. What does matter is that I'm in the same situation as you. And since I know more than you about promoting libraries, I do have advice. You compare yourself with Dapper. Do it right and use their quickstart/readme to show your solutions to their user cases. Trust me, it's been the second most effective way of promoting my ORM. 
That is something, at least, but its certainly not a differentiating factor when picking an ORM. Looking it over some more, I might see value in the inline methods for updating an entity with a DTO or partial set of fields, and the wrappers around bulk inserts. I think the dev needs to spend some time thinking about the marketing if they have a goal of increasing usage or pull requests, but I wish them luck.
And Linq2db, faster than ef core.
Thanks! I wanted to include that one, but I couldn't remember the name.
A number of popular packages depend on Castle.Core... Moq &amp; Unity come to mind. An install of either of them will result in an install of Castle. So take the sum of those two packages and you already have a ginormous downloads rank. As for usage... I think it provides a number of reflection/virtualization functionalities that both moq and Unity are based on.
Probably that how array implements each interface: bool IList.IsReadOnly =&gt; true; bool IList&lt;T&gt;.IsReadOnly =&gt; false;
Would a submodule accomplish what your looking for? https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
Query hints are something I'm looking into as well. It's not hard to bolt them on for one database, but I would like to do so in a semi-agnostic fashion and that requires a lot of research. 
Kind of this is usually called Continuous Integration &amp;/ Deployment. Not quite 'no manual steps' but push to GIT and your project would be built. Not exactly the scenario you describe but really the question your question raises is \*why would you want to\*? Unless you had a bunch of unit &amp;/ integration tests you'd be trusting the remote machine to build correctly and really couldn't debug (easily...there are ways but they're not totally frictionless).
&gt; and the wrappers around bulk inserts. Generalized wrappers? Or database specific ones that expose more functionality at the expense of slightly different APIs for each?
Not sure about VSCode but we did this all the time using Visual Studio and TFS. There were build servers set up that would do hourly builds, sent out email alerts on failed builds, etc.
Array is broken for this interface. It is readonly because you can't add/remove items. But not readonly because you can replace items.
[https://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/11/icollection-isreadonly-and-arrays.html](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/11/icollection-isreadonly-and-arrays.html) tl;dr they changed semantic meanings when introducing generics.
&gt; It is readonly because you can't add/remove items You're thinking of IsFixedSize. 
Why does ExcelDNA do that? Is it a bug or a general limitation of addins? 
Taken from RepoDb/Extensions/DbConnectionExtension.cs: // Validate, only supports SqlConnection if (connection.IsForProvider(Provider.Sql) == false) { throw new NotSupportedException("The bulk-insert is only applicable for SQL Server database connection."); } Ouch, I guess not.
That's not a property on IList&lt;T&gt;, though maybe it should be.
Never seen any code use that property.
&gt; Trust me, it's been the second most effective way of promoting my ORM. Is the most effective way to be built by a recognizable name like Microsoft or StackOverflow? 
Have someone mail you a disc with visual studio? Go to a place with better internet, download a cached copy of VS to a usb drive? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/create-an-offline-installation-of-visual-studio?view=vs-2017
You should be able to download the .net framework and a text editor and go. You can use command line stuff to compile everything. It would be rough. Can you turn your phone into a hotspot? Or go to a library to download stuff? Visual Studio Code is lighter weight, but I am not sure if it needs the internet or not. Notepad++ and Sublime are good text editors to use for coding.
I really like the colors on that chrome logo
You can tether your phone to your computer and share the internet to it. Either wifi hotspot or over a USB cable. Failing that just download the ISO on your phone then transfer it over. VS may use all your data though, maybe go for VS Code instead
Perhaps remote debug is what you're after? As long as you have access to the remote machine, via RDP, VNC, ect, then you can debug locally an application built on another machine.
Do you know where the ISO would be available at? That seems like my only real option.
Just use VS Code
Wait, a nuget feed can be a simple directory?? Holy crap this changes everything.
Like he said, the first screenshot under Screenshots. https://wisej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Escreenshot-themebuilder-1.png 
Yeah I was looking at that but I wasn't sure what it is exactly. I really just need something to practice on, I don't care for making anything too big. Would I be able to start coding in c# right off the bat with VS Code? 
so maybe python? others here have mentioned that it was suggested and the excel dev team responded by saying they might consider it.
Yep! You’ll need to download the C# Extension for VS Code for code highlighting, and the .Net Core SDK for compiling your code. But I use VS Code everyday for my C# work.
You need to set the `Model1`'s related entities' `EntityState` to `Unchanged`. EF will then ignore those entities during `SaveChanges`. ``` var mod1Entry = ctx.Model1s.Update(mod1); // set all related collection's EntityState to Unchanged foreach (var relatiedEntity in mod1Entry.Collections.SelectMany(c =&gt; c.CurrentValue.OfType&lt;object&gt;())) ctx.Entry(relatiedEntity).State = EntityState.Unchanged; // todo: set all related non-collection navigation properties' EntityState to Unchanged // you can use mod1Entry.References for the above ctx.SaveChanges(); ```
My question was in general. The reason I asked is that I need to implement bulk inserts for my ORM. But I'm more than happy to donate my code to this project as well once I figure it out.
Well no, but I'm limiting my advice to what's feasible. 
just today I learned something fucked up about vba. The following is not allowed: inputValue = CDbl(Inputbox(Prompt:="input a number: ")) It gets a reference error of some kind. However, casting it to a double on a separate line works just fine. Why the fuck does VBA do this when litterally every other language i've ever used that allows typecasting would allow for this? I don't fucking know, but goddamn is it annoying. Just another thing to add to the list of quirks that only apply to VBA and not the other 6-8 languages i've used.
Maybe. I don't know how well significant white space will work though. It makes sharing code harder than necessary. 
VSC and light weight? Are we talking about the same editor? Maybe more lightweight than Atom. Sublime is lightweight, notepad++ is lightweight. But no, VSC doesn‘t need an connection to the internet after the first setup, THOUGH after installation you need to download some plugins in order to work with it properly.
Just because a thing exists doesn't mean it isn't worth having an alternative. Just because there is no stand out difference doesn't mean that someone won't choose this one over the others for any of the smaller differences that surely exist.
Nice. Are the extensions and Net SDK in the same area as the vs code download location? Also would I be able to apply the extensions offline? 
Here is the Link for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Here is the Link for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) you’re gunna want the installer for what ever system your on. You will download the extension from within VS Code and install it (should be small) there is an extensions tab on the left of the app where you can search C#. You’ll have to be online to initially download the extension (along with VS Code and the .Net Core SDK) but once you set that up initially you won’t have to be online to use the extension, write your code, and build your app.
Unfortunately I don't have any other ways of obtaining VS. As for the first option I feel like I would get discouraged from learning to code using that method, but I'll definitely try it if all other options don't work. BTW, does anyone else have any experience with monodevelop and VS Code? Could those be better options for my situation? 
I never claimed the contrary. In fact, I have a hard time trusting a backend developer whose never written an ORM. When my career started it was almost considered a rite of passage. And really, ORMs by and large suck, my own included. No one has figured out the secret sauce so to speak, so there's a lot of room for research. 
Damn, I don't have any way to get internet on my PC unfortunately so I don't this VS code would workout. Do you have any experience with [monodevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/)? Is that a full IDE? 
I'd go with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp). Full VS would likely be a pain in the ass to get (and keep) up and running with no internet, and you'd be gaining more advanced features and larger menus and more to figure out. Not worth it for starting out. Those two downloads plus [.NET SDK Itself](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) are what you need to get started (and weigh in something like 10% full VS download). BUT ! Dependency/package management is where a workaround will need to happen: By default the dotnet compiler tries to hit nuget.org for dependencies, so you'll have to: A) manually download some nuget packages (depends on what you're doing) B) set up a local nuget cache for these downloads and tell nuget to look there instead. this random [search result](https://blog.bigfont.ca/dotnet-restore-without-an-internet-connection/) touches on it, but i digress. post about that if/when you need to heh. 
Hmm I don’t have any experience with that but it seems like it might be. There’s other IDEs out there like CLion too that have good reviews. Just doing a quick google I found this [LINK](https://vscode-offline.herokuapp.com/) to be able to download Vs Code extensions independently of the app. I’m gathering your plan is to go to a Library or something, download all this to a flash drive and then install on ur computer?
I only have my phone to download things, no other options. Thanks for the info though, I'll figure it out eventually.
&gt; For that, two primitive types are used, which I call triangles, curve triangles and double curve triangles. Hrm. 🤔 
 Nice, just the info I needed for my situation, thank you. 
I use it for parameter validation, on the very rare occasions my parameters are `IList&lt;T&gt;` instead of `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` or `IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;`.
That's probably the best answer, but another option is to copy the values into a new entity that doesn't have the child records loaded.
Man that sucks. I’d hate for something so trivial get in the way of someone getting into coding. If you have a DVD drive and a mailing address I will gladly burn a disk for ya and mail it wherever in the world you’re at when I get into work on Monday. Just PM me if you want me to.
I wrote my own called Tortuga Anchor/Sails. The reason I did this is that I wanted support for `IChangeTracking`, `IReverableChangeTracking`, and `IEditableObject`. These interfaces are harder to implement than one might think as they need to walk the object graph. If you don't need this, pretty much any MVVM framework is going to work. Though I really don't like MvvmLite because it tends to leak memory. (And last time I checked, the fixes for the memory leaks made it silently fail to send messages.)
&gt; MVVM is not dogma, it doesn't meant "never write code-behind." This! So much bad code has been written (by me) while trying to needlessly achieve zero code behind. 
Yes in the sense that it's a fundamental design pattern, but no in the sense that it is anyway remotely similar to Web MVC. (Also note that Web MVC has nothing to do with MVC.) Anyways, this article may help. https://www.infoq.com/articles/View-Model-Definition
I've just started to use EF in applications so don't have much experience with its behaviour yet, but I'm fluent in SQL. Could you give an example of a quirky join it generates?
In a normal SQL query, a left or outer joins results in a new set of columns that come from both tables. You may have heard this referred to as a "projection". By default, EF treats each table in the query as its own collection of columns. So instead of getting back (a,b1), (a,b2), (a,b3) you get (a)-&gt;(b1),(b2),(b3). Converting from how SQL sees things to how EF sees things is a major part of its performance problem. In this example, EF got three rows and created 4 objects of out them. But in other examples I've seen EF get back literally millions of rows from the database to only create a few thousand objects. *** Fundamentally the problem is that EF queries don't work the same way a database queries work. So a lot of fuckery is needed to mask the differences. 
Excel is old, in that it’s not new. The software has been around for decades. It’s maintained, but that does not make it not old
You don’t need a framework. Using a framework actually makes you less valuable compared to just learning the tools. WPF has everything you need in the box You just need to learn how the mvvm pattern works. If you only learn a framework, then you still won’t know how mvvm works
Makes sense - thanks.
There are online sites like https://dotnetfiddle.net/ or https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_csharp_online.php Do a search for C# online to find a bunch of sites that offer online compile and run for C# (and other languages).
Thanks for the suggestion, I am not using Unity I am using Godot. I think a more typical approach (one you would see in a general software engineering context) is more applicable to my scenario
Great thank you! This sounds exactly like the approach I would want to take.
Awesome yeah seems like a nuget package is the way to go. Thank you so much!
I will look into it, though it seems like others' suggestions of using a nuget package is more appropriate for my use-case. Still, submodules seems like a useful thing to know anyway so I appreciate you bringing it up.
Technically you can remove items from an array.
Have you tried sharing your phone's data to your computer, either through usb or as a local wifi hot-spot?

No, RepoDb may supports all DB providers, if you are using RAWSQL. We used it when querying data via ODBC (SAP HANA). However, you are absolutely correct for BulkInsert that it is currently supporting the SQL Server. In order for RepoDb to support the other DB Providers via object based queries, one must write IStatementBuilder for that DB Provider and inject inside the library. **Note**: RepoDb RAWSQL feature support all the DB Providers, as writing the SQL and passing the parameters is all done by the developer itself.
RepoDb offers: 2nd layer Caching, Tracing, InlineHints (Operations), MultiQuery (Poco, RawSql), TypeMapping (TypeConversion is new), Fields Mapping, Repository Operations, and many more specially for extensibility. I used to develop it that way, it is all a collective knowledge in using the other ORM and the actual challenges we are facing using them (in many years). Try to dive further in the docs (I hope) and you will see and built a lot of business cases through it. And of course, give us feedback. Thanks
This feature is one of the feature that makes RepoDb a bit DB coupled together with BulkInsert. We know that already :) However, remember that we support the IStatementBuilder, which means that the other DB Provider must have their own way of writing the StatementBuilder. It is written that RepoDb statement builder is currently for SQL Server. But definitely, the library is not limited to SQL Server if you are using RAWSQL.
Can you help me promoting my library? If yes, what should I do from this point in time.. Btw, the company (where I currently worked on) may adopting it and I heard they are aiming to bringing it inside (gossips and talks from our EA), but the RTE of our ART knows it already and he asked me to finalize everything before completely rolling it out. He knows that critica systems are running through this library. I am telling this, as this is where we are when it comes to promoting this library, and ofcourse through **csharp** sub reddit group.
Except it's the opposite.
The OP asked "why" not "how".
&gt; And really, ORMs by and large suck, my own included. No one has figured out the secret sauce so to speak What I've been wondering about is whether we actually know what the right problem to solve is. Do we know what jobs an ORM should perform? Are the various solutions out there even barking up the right tree? It seems like if we really had a firm idea of what the job of an ORM should be, it would be easier to say "yes, such-and-such is the best approach".
Is there a good solution for privately hosted Nuget packages? We're using submodules for a shared library at work and it's a bit of a pain (have to hack around a few things because visual studio isn't designed for it). 
Thanks for the offer man, that's really generous. Fortunately I still have a few amount reliable options I can try and I think I'll eventually get it to work on my own. Thanks again though. 
You’ll probably get better results if you don’t have to do the text-to-speech locally. Azure’s TTS has a free tier (up to 5 hours of speech per month) and Amazon Polly is free for 12 months (up to 5 million characters per month) and both are pretty cheap beyond their respective free thresholds. 
Try renaming your sum variable to something else
You have two options: * Use a network share. You can publish the packages to the folder by the NuGet CLI (hell, you can even copy the .nupkg file into it by hand). * [Use NuGet Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/nuget-server) At my job, we use a NuGet Server and it works fairly well.
[Yup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds)
I'm trying out IBM Watson, but idk if it has C# compatibility. Also I'm completely new to IBM Cloud so it's all confusing as shit. As for your suggestion I'll take a look.
&gt; There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. It makes sense because curve triangles encode one curve, while double curve triangles encode two curves. The latter is only used in some special cases.
I would love full svg support. There’s thousands of lines of svg reading and drawing code in my current codebase. 
This is the final objective (sans text currently). I have yet to decide how to handle the animations (because there are properties that can animated which impact directly on the primitive generation), but I’d like to implement everything SVG allows, such as the different paint servers, clipping, masking, opacity (hard to get right) and others.
how do you cope without visual studio smart intellisense 
Ok, fair enough, you have a valid point. Perhaps he needs to answer your question early on his GitHub readme and think at a slightly higher level. There are many ORMs out there, why this one?
If you’re investigating the cloud and using C# then Azure should be your first choice as they have .NET SDKs for almost all the services. 
thank you - exactly what I was after.
I agree with the other comments. Microsoft docs is usually pretty good and there is good training material out there. In additional to that have a look at [Productive C#](https://www.productivecsharp.com/) and the associated [Productive C# Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXflBJMuMQ7INty0hZCAvLg) if you want to stay current with the continuous evolution of the language and the .NET platform.
I like this for field initialisation. But I think should be avoided in method calls
PetaPoco maintainer here. I'm always happy to see new additions in this space. Sure, there's a fair few ORMs/MircoOrms out there, but that doesn't mean there's no room for more. Great work on having a rich feature set and documentation! I also help out with the [.net awesome list](https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet#orm), if you submit a PR and tag me, I'll get it on this list for you.
Wow, this is great @plebsori. Thank you for the offer. Will surely do very soon, after finalizing the wiki for all feature sets of RepoDb.
Hopefully they'll add some analyzer rules that says you should be clear about the type you're instantiation directly in the method.
I believe the maxim was extended to be _"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things and off-by-one errors."_
You should be able to use the &lt;inheritdoc /&gt; for this kind of things if I remember correctly? 
This is some javascript level consistency. /s
It doesn't work but with some googling I think I need something called "Sandcastle" for that to work. I am currently trying to figure out what that is...
&gt;The following is not allowed: yes it is. I just tried it and it works just fine Sub test() Dim inputValue As Double inputValue = CDbl(InputBox(Prompt:="input a number: ")) Debug.Print inputValue * 2 End Sub 
That would help yeah. My main concern is that with this feature,it could be a breaking change to add a new overload to a method or constructor. If you added an overload which switched one argument for another that also had the same ctor signature, the compiler wouldn't know which to chose and you've now introduced a breaking change without being any the wiser, until a consumer of your code alerts you 
I think &lt;inheritdoc/&gt; is provided by Resharper. Resharper is an extensive and expensive visual studio add on. Have a Google about it. They might even have cheap or free licenses for learners not doing production stuff and if so you can try it out. I'm not a fan of it tbh, slows down my workflow too much as it sometimes brings visual studio to a halt 
Alright, I tried your solution, and nope, still doesn't work. Maybe because in the actual implementation, it is the "Related model of a related model". &amp;#x200B; To be more specific, there is 3 model: Product, ProductDetailType1, ProductDetailType1Category The `ProductDetailType1Category` is displayed in a DropdownList. When I call the Update on the Product, it updates: Product, ProductDetailType1 (we are good to this point, both should be updated) AND ProductDetailType1Category and this last is the problem, as the ProductDetailType1 has a categoryId, the EF will replace all column in the Category table with NULLs due to the "empty model" that got POST-ed back. &amp;#x200B; Another thing that worth noting: I load the entire structure with eager loading: `db.Prods.Where(...).Include(p =&gt; p.DetailType1.Category);` 
Thanks, I have heard about it, but so far I have never felt the need for what it provides. And this case here is not such a big deal either. I also found open discussions regarding this so I guess I'll wait for that: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/pull/1749
Wouldn't it cause the EF to store the related model, and when I try to query those again, it will return this empty "stub" model?
So far we have 'tabs or spaces', 'to var or not to var', now time to add new argument we're gonna argue over at StackOverflow, blog posts etc... 'to use type in new or not'.. Can't wait with my popcorn..
&gt; We can also ommit the type duplication when we want to perform field initialization, but also inside field initialization when we are doing another field initialization and more. This is not field initialization... You're confusing it with the "Object Initializer" syntax. And in this example it's not even that, it's the Collection Initializer.
Indeed, adding overloads sometimes already breaks source compatibility due to ambiguous implicit conversions, this makes it much harder to fix such breakages.
I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do. 
Well, thanks! I hope you find it worth-sharing to anybody. Much better to have a small hands-on experience on it so you can better decide whether you really liked to share it or not.
I think it would much better if var were allowed for fields (like for instance with Swift). This is a bit of a mess IMO. 
C# in Depth. The current version was finally released last week, if you have the meap version. CLR via C# was good, but I haven't read it in 5+ years.
I don't understand your comment. Could you give a code sample?
I wouldn't argue it's a code noise reduction, because now *either* the lhs or rhs of an expression must be read to know the type for type inference. Life's better when you don't have "or" in your code. So it's one more team policy on top of other team policies.
I am so confused of why you seem to completely dismiss the hotspot/tether option if you have internet on your phone
I am so confused of why you seem to completely dismiss the hotspot/tether option if you have internet on your phone? 
Not in the case of a method argument. 
Yay lets reduce readibility of code to zero without IDEs to help with. I assume go to def on new() will work in VS but how I am going to know which type it is when doing a code review or just looking at code file? There is a balance between short code files and readability and I am concerned this new c# features just aim to make cs files shorter not easier to read
 var whatever = db.Mod1.Where(...).Include(p =&gt; p.ChildModels); // EF begin tracking both Model1 and all its Model2 //POST back data from UI db.Mod1.Update(mod1); db.Collections(mod1.ChildNodes).ForEach(m =&gt; m.State = Unchanged); //EF Still tracks them, but thinks that Model2s are unchanged var mod2s = db.Mod2.Where(...) // Wouldn't this line retrieve the "unchanged" "empty" Model2s from the the POST data? &amp;#x200B;
Added the PR, just now. Thanks!
Can you pass in arguments to the constructor or does this only work for parameterless constructors?
The correct answer is "do whichever, it's equivalent code and the important thing is the code is completed on time". But I guess the bikeshed won't paint itself that specific shade of red; carry on squabbling I guess.
I hope the feature will be cofigurable through .editorconfig so teams/project owners will be able to decide whether to use it, or go more explicit way.
At least, so far, most if not all of those features can be controlled through .editorconfig, so the project owner can choose/force a coding style. Hopefully, we'll get that here too. But I can already see the posts arguing back and forth about 'what's better'. I'm myself not sure which route I'd prefer and in what circumstances..
I'd argue that there are plenty of situations where the explicit type doesn't matter, when during code review. If you have a method accepting a simple POCO, where intent is inferred from the method name, it shouldn't matter. ``` CreatePackage(new( packageCode, packageName, packageAttribute); ``` That wouldn't really benefit from explicitly stating `new Package`, especially if typename would be something stupid long (which sometimes it is in .Net) Of course there are plenty of situations where explicit type would be handy and should be included.. So I guess it will be like `var` - use with caution to make code better, not worse.. we'll need developers to use common sense whether to use it or not.
Actually I was thinking it mattered in a situation like that, especially if code review included a change in that line. Previously it would be something like CreatePackage(new Package(...)) so I would know to go look at Package class to see what the new param is, if something else should be used etc. Now my only option would be to either already know the type is Package or have a go to def option where new goes to Package class or find CreatePackage method def first and learn the input type. This becomes a lot more important for option structs where it is less obvious what parameters are available and more likely that one might want to see what options are there. I don't see the argument where CreatePackage(new Package() { ..} is less readable then CreatePackage(new() { }.
That's because you gave EF those "empty" `Model2` after you called `Update`. If you want to use those `Model2` from the database, query them before you call `Update`.
It makes sense in the case of simple DTOs such as MyClassSettings where the class only exists to pass along optional parameters.
It's been a while since I've tried it but there's a few ways to get it done. Here's a nice series for a library management system: https://youtu.be/WTVcLFTgDqs You can follow his structure exactly or skip to whatever sections of the videos are relevant. Basically he uses Entity Framework to interact with the database and uses calls in the controller to query EF and load the data into model classes. Then the model is passed to the View and the View iteratively extracts the data and loads it into form controls through Razor syntax. He explains it much better than me though.
I would argue that method arguments should err on the side of verbosity. It's bad enough that you don't even know the name of the arguments when you see a method invocation, now you're magically conjuring up a `new()` object with no context. 
I will post another topics to discuss more about the features when I complete the Wiki page update. For now, if you care about the features, you can visit the documentation. If you care about the performance, please have a look on the latest run of FransBoumas: https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20190307_netcore.txt
Angular &lt;-&gt; Web API &lt;-&gt; Entity Framework / ORM &lt;-&gt; DB
I am using razor. 
I like this, but ***only*** for the case of inline member initialization. It applies the DRY principle there. All other use cases, unfortunately, decrease code readability and make things more cryptic. 
Doesn’t matter. All razor will do is create an HTML element: &lt;input type=“text” id=“Model_Field” /&gt; You could then use JQuery to manipulate client side $(‘#Model_Field’).val(‘Value’); If you rely on a controller to provide the data your page will not load until the database transaction has completed. If you use a client side driven framework and a lightweight API then you can keep your framework responsive. 
I would consider that ancient at this point... and very much to be avoided at all costs.
Without seeing your Write() method, it is hard to tell. But is there a chance that Write is an async method, and you are exiting the program before that async returns? If so you may be missing an await. Also, it looks like you are calling [Task.Run](https://Task.Run)(some async stuff), without waiting for that task to finish. This means that your app may exit before disconnect is done. You may need to add .Wait() to the end of that to make sure the app doesn't exit before that is finished. Note: If you are using c# 7 or &gt; I think... You can just make your program main method async. That makes it a bit less confusing, as you can just await anywhere you are doing async... vs switching from await to .Wait()... which can also cause some other issues if you aren't careful.
Holy literal hell I just noticed the 666...
Noise reduction. The fact that it's a 'Package' is immaterial as it's just a way to transport optional parameters. This is hard to see because you left out the important part, which is the parameters themselves. 
Yes, you can.
What do you mean actual SVG rendering? What's wrong with existing SVG rendering libraries such as this generically named one?
 var s = new XmlSerializer( new () { InferTypes= true, IgnoreNamespaces = false}; var s = new XmlSerializer( new XmlSerializerSettings() { InferTypes= true, IgnoreNamespaces = false}; In my estimation, being explicit just distracts from the parameters that I actually care about. The fact that they are shoved into an XmlSerializerSettings object is not interesting to me.
_Actual_ is referring to my project itself, which then only rendered single paths and restricted to a proprietary file format (just for test). The actual is emphasizing that I finally managed to make the project to read SVG and extract paths from it.
I wouldn’t say I was ever a super power user of visual studio so there’s probably features missing that I just don’t know about but the C# extension for VS Code seems to be pretty good about autocompleting functions for me, basic code snippets, and refactoring options. I would suggest giving it a try!
I just added Write at the end, it's not async Which [Task.Run](https://Task.Run) do you mean? I have there either await or continueWith - that's not it? Will there be any drawbacks if I make main method async? Does it mean than I could remove all other async keywords and just use await to wait for task to finish? Do I understand it right?
No drawbacks, in fact it can save you from some deadlock mistakes. It is always best to start async as high up as you can in your work flow. Once you do this, you can just use the await keyword in any of your async tasks vs Task.Wait(), etc. Also, a lot of people confused [Task.Run](https://Task.Run) with a regular async Task... [Task.Run](https://Task.Run) is really only needed when you want something to run on a separate thread. If all you are really trying to do is be async and not block the current thread, don't use [Task.Run](https://Task.Run). Instead... .Wait() your task (if you aren't in an async method), otherwise await. But if you start async higher up, it will be easier (so you aren't switching from .Wait to await everywhere.
But my point is there is now an extra step to look for what params are available without IDE assistance.
I'm doing some work on Text to Speech in Azure right now. It's very simple to consume. What exactly do you need to do? Feel free to PM me.
I guess I could make an exception for settings structures... but in the general case I would argue absolutely not for this pattern. 
Ill show you my code in an update later today, with a video and the error along with the fix and all.
I've already tried the code you've said doesn't work and it works fine. Any reference error you're getting isn't related to those two lines that you have said are "not allowed".
Like I said, later today I will give you the code in addition to providing a video of the error and the fix. At that point if you feel you can educate me, you are more than welcome. Until then be patient.
In your comment you claimed: &gt;The following is not allowed: &gt; &gt;Dim inputValue As Double &gt;inputValue = CDbl(Inputbox(Prompt:="input a number: ")) I've told you that that is factually incorrect - this is perfectly valid code. Any other code you feel you need to show me is simply moving the goalposts.
Like I said, I will, later today. I'm busy this morning ave afternoon and won't have access to a computer or my code until later today. You need to be patient.
I'll try and explain this in a non technical way which may hopefully make it easier to visualize. Threads are like train tracks and on that track your code executes. So imagine you add a sleep in an app with a ui. When you call sleep everything in your app just hangs and waits for the sleep time to complete. So in other words your app will become unresponsive and the user won't be able to interact with it. (most will think the app has crashed) Same thing goes for having a long executing function on a single threaded ui app even without Thread.Sleep() again your main ui will freeze. So using our example above we will need more train lines so that we can execute multiple code paths without any of them holding up the others. We give our ui one train track and create other new tracks for executing code. This all allows multiple actions while keeping our code flowing smoothly. So we manage threads to allow us to have efficient code execution. Threads aren't tied to security and I've never seen a security issue around their implementation. However it's totally possible any badly implemented code could have security ramifications. Hope the above helps. 
I don't need to be patient for anything; stop being so condescending. You said you can't pass the return if `inputbox` into `cdbl` and I'm telling you you're wrong. End of story.
Ive been kind and respectful thus whole time. I have not been rude or condescending to you. If anything I've said makes you feel like I was rude, then I'm sorry. Nothing you say is going to change the fact that I received the error I referred to and that I will show it to you later today. Please be more respectful in the future. I'd really appreciate it.
If you want to keep it simple you can use the built in scaffolding feature to automatically build the list, add, edit and delete for an entity framework model. There’s a nice tutorial here that takes you through it step by step: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.2&amp;tabs=visual-studio
I feel I have been perfectly respectful and it is you who is unwilling to acknowledge the content of my comments but instead seek to imply I am somehow being impatient. Any video of some other issue is not germane to the argument you have initially presented and which I have countered, and repeatedly refusing to acknowledge the content of my comments whilst telling me I need to be patient is, indeed, condescending. Whether or not you received an error within your code is totally unrelated to your claim that those two lines of code you presented are invalid code. They are not invalid and I have provided a self contained example you can run to see that they are perfectly valid.
[removed]
&gt; I feel I have been perfectly respectful Not only have you insulted me, you insist that my claim is wrong, inconsistent, and invalid. Stop it. Remain patient. I will respond to you properly later today.
Thank you! I'm going to try that. Where exactly should I put that "high level" async? On 'public MainWindow()'? I tried to make that disconnect Wait() and it's deadlocked. Is it right like this? internal async Task Disconnect() { await StopTask(); Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt; { if (_serial.IsOpen()) { _serial.Clear(); _serial.Close(); } }); } [Screen tasks](https://ctrlv.cz/shots/2019/03/10/dXXl.png) You are saying that [Task.Run](https://Task.Run)() is not needed. What about LightLeds() method? That is right or could also be written differently? And yeah, my only goal is to make my logic not to block main UI. I thought I need it to run it in separate thread &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
What a ludicrous thing to say! Where have I insulted you? I agree that I have claimed your statement to be wrong; that is not an insult. I was simply responding to a factually incorrect claim you made about 2 very simple lines of code.
Good analogy. Just to add to this... a lot of developers using C# 5 and higher accidentally use 'Thread' when they really should be using Task/async/await stuffs. Lot's of reasons why, but here are a few: \- Allocating threads using Task.Run() are more isolated which can help prevent you affecting performance outside of your app. They are also more efficient to allocate. \- Most of the time you don't need a new thread, you just need to not block things. Okay, since you are using the train analogy, I will piggy back on that. With async/await... you can essentially tell the train to move to the side (station side track). Man, I suck at analogies. But you essentially tell the train to step to the side and wait for a signal to go again. Then other trains can keep moving. Once the train is ready to go again, it signals and jumps back on the main track. Doing this can be more efficient because you didn't have to build a new full rail line. You just take turns using it, and get out of the way to let others use it when you aren't. This prevents your UI (or other operations) from being blocked and feeling stuck.
You should put it in your program Main method... that can be async now if you are using one of the more current C# versions. If you aren't... then you may have to do it the level below that. Also, I haven't written forms apps in a long time, but having your event handlers be async is also good. Yes, your new disconnect method looks good. Your event handler should now just be await Disconnect().
This is just a subset of several TUI features and tools that will all be included through future releases.
I might have misread, but I'm not quite following you here. It looked like this is just eliding the type name, so by the time the compiler is type checking the syntactic sugar has already been auto inserted for you. 
Well, maybe I should've mentioned this is WPF application, but I think I got what you meant &amp;#x200B; Yeah but now when I press exit it stays deadlocked waiting for StopTask() to end forever
This seems like an XY problem. What are you actually trying to do? 
This looks nice, might use it, but not sure what for…
Thanks for the great addition
Let’s say you have a bunch of customers or employees and want to print off a list of them with their first name, last name, and ID. You can feed all those values into a new table using a loop and it will do all of the organizing for you. Or let’s say you have a help command for your console. You can create and print a table with your command and its description using reflection and attributes. Or let’s say you have a Unity game, and your game has a developer console. Using this, you can print off a full table of players with the columns Name, SteamID, Ping, and Hours, which is great for reporting and tracking hackers. Or let’s just say you have an app that uses WMI and loops through several classes and methods, like in the picture above. Let’s say one of those components fails, doesn’t exist, or gives back a null value. Add it to the table then print it off letting the user or yourself know that several components could not be found or accessed. Or let’s also say your app has a log system that writes to a text file. You can include tables of important information inside your log files using the Append method. There are several uses for something like this. ;)
That is usually due to not awaiting something, or using wait ()/result() somewhere. Make sure any methods you are using tasks are async. Then make sure any task you make you await.
https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja This YouTube was the first that made it make sense to me. With practice of what he taught, I got a job as a software dev with a Fortune 500 company. Full disclosure: I was already a Systems Engineer with the same company, but I wouldn’t have been allowed to switch teams had it not been for what I learned from him.
Thank you, I will have at look at his videos. :)
This is dope but I there mobile website isn't
Like anything else I think it has its place and it would be foolish to have a strict rule against it. I’m on mobile and can’t show more, but objects like XmlNode which take child XmlNodes in their constructor are another good one. 
Simple Injector has been pleasant to work with
Looks really neat, reminds me of the Format-Table (aliased as “ft”) in PowerShell. :)
This is really sick actually, I have a project that this could benefit from. Could I have your GitHub username so I can follow you?
Thank you! I’m glad I’m able to help. My username is carverd12 or you can also look through my post history. Cheers!
Thank you! I put a lot of work and optimizing into this, I’m very pleased with my results.
GitHub link?
Thanks for idea for SCIO. I’ll still give credit tho.
It’s not up yet, but when it is I’ll be making a new post. I’ll be sure to tag you in the comments. :)
Yeah, this
Always glad to see people working with the console, it's a fun challenge to work with. :) I've been working on a library (.NET Framework, C#) that'll allow for quick and easy drawing/rendering in the Windows console (conhost). I've made a functional alpha, but I've been in the "I'm gonna rewrite this soon" phase half a year now. :P
I would love to learn about your project. It always makes me happy and to learn from those I help. :)
SpecialConsoleIO is a simple library for console that allows you to do cool things such as write colored/rainbow lines, write logs, get inputs with desired type. I’m currently working on it, I released sever versions on NuGet but it’s not totally done.
Thanks! A fun challenge it was that took me two weeks to finish. It would have only taken me a couple of days though it if weren’t for being so burned out. Best advice is to push through it and spend at least 1 hour a day working on it. :)
Sounds cool. Good luck with your project and future endeavors!
Yeah, definitely. :) Sadly, working in software development is a quick way to feel burned out when it comes to hobby projects. :P
This actually started as a hobby. I’ve been working on a private project the CIA is waiting for me to submit to them. Part of it was making tables. So I know how it feels!
&gt; started as a hobby &gt; the CIA is waiting for me Boy, that escalated quickly. :P But good on you for scoring such a gig! :D
Hahaha! And thank you! I’m also a whistleblower for the IRS, so if you know of any companies not following the rules don’t be afraid to share the info. ;)
You should look into contributing to PowerShell and optimizing the `Format-Table` command :)
Good to see this, Always love to try new stuff, how does it compare to [sqlKata](https://sqlkata.com/)?
Agreed for now, but I may change my mind later.
[removed]
I've been using var everywhere since the beginning and have never encountered a time where I regretted it. I have encountered times where it's saved me a lot of effort when refactoring. With this new syntax I'm more hesitant. 
This is exactly my opinion. All code has its place and its usage. If used properly it can help, if not, oh well
I’ll definitely look into it! But I can definitely tell you I don’t have high hopes of making something better than my favorite software company that is one of the most advanced, made my OS, and the framework we use! 
20 years in enterprise software development and I am adamantly against any sort of strict standard on this stuff. 
Well, except goto I guess :p
Hey if someone wants to show me why they think it makes their code clearer, and I am unable to find a more clear and concise way to code it, then I wouldn’t tell them “no” just because it’s some rule. 
True, true :)
I don't have those options. My plan doesn't include hotspot and from what I've heard about my data carrier, they seem to disallow tethering (I think something about ToS and termination). 
You too?
A far different actually, though I have not used SqlKata yet, but upon looking at their docs and github page, it seems to be a c# query builder. We in RepoDb are trying our best to eliminate the SQL Statements in C# (if only we can avoid), for basic ORM operations. Features and programming usability will be far different too. We tend to be more Hybrid when switching between lightweights and massive operations. And of course, every line of codes and new class instantiation inside RepoDb is observed heavily, we are very obsessed to retain the least memory usage as possible and make it as fast as possible.
Tag me as well
Will do.
I would like to know as well
I liked the article about how you discovered patterns. Way back when we had things called "Case tools". They sucked and no one used them because they implied you could get a dozen monkeys, teach them some patterns and have them assemble software on the cheap. (I am massively over simplifying, but go with it :) ) The GoF patterns are one step above an if statement. They are the little 4X4 lego blocks with wheels on. "If" is just a 4X4 block. You don't learn to build software by reading GoF any more than you learn to build software by reading the C# language specification, but there are times when you just want to be able to say "sod it, I'll chuck a facade in" without having to stumble on that solution. 
Why would you not use IDE?
I bet there will be a configuration in StyleCop and ReSharper for it
Will do.
 &gt; I find this pattern to be very useful when refactoring applications which have many different rules regarding how objects behave, particularly in our line-of-business apps which often have many different possible strategies in play. I did something like this with Dictionaries and Lists of ``Func&lt;T, bool``. 
But hotspot/tethering is a part of the OS on the phone, not through your data carrier? If you have a mobile data-connection on your phone you will be able to share through the system settings, they have no way to actually disallow that. 
What's the DI book called?
Obligatory downvote cause fuck the IRS
Damn should probably have waited till you had the repo ready to post.
Even when using an IDE, code reviews and remote code browsing (another branch) wouldn't have most IDE provided features.
Yeah the app and everything is there and you can technically make a hotspot and tether connection but the issues pop up when you try to load up a web page, thats where you get an error saying that it's not part of your plan. Maybe there's some other ways to bypass it but honestly, I usually always run into some kind of issues and in the end it can take hours of trying just to find out it won't work. 
Thanks
what is trigggering the update event?
I'm not too sure if I know what you mean. I'm using unity, and VS.
I am totally going to use this in my console app I use for work, thanks! Putting a pin in this!
ok, but you have a function called public void update(), i assume this is an event, which must be called by something. what is calling this function? what's the object which generates it? is it the same monobehaviour you inhereted the class from?
I just written it and basically it just happens all of the time, not just when the game starts. Its not being called I dont think.
you mean that it keeps going forever?
Yes
try CancelInvoke() before the return statement
Thank you!
Can you use spaces instead of dots? What does the in 0 ms part represent? is this part of the library? if so, the longest part of displaying stuff to the console is the buffering so i would expect it to always say 0 ms but take more than 0 ms to display.
Done
Pretty helpful analogy. And it pretty much wrapped up the threading base for me. If I have any questions I'll just google them. Thanks again!

The dots you see are called guide/grouping characters, you can use any character you want including spaces. I included this as a feature for those that want added readability for tables that have a ton of columns and entries. Also the 0ms is just statistical information. It is a measurement of how long the creation process took from organizing to building the final table. On a slow and lousy laptop I was able to build a table with 600+ entries in only 7 ms, pretty fast right? After the table is built, both the header and footer is stylized according to you, the time it took to stylize is not included in the calculation as that’s just a user setting.
Information splitting, also called the Column Margin is actually user defined. You can do *myTable.ColumnMargin = 100;* for 100 spaces between columns based on the largest cell in the column. In the picture above, the column margin is 2. Every library I’ve seen does not have this option for some reason so I’m glad I added it!
what does "build a table" represent if it's not the formatting or output to the console? The time to instantiate objects of the table type?
Take a look at the params keyword if you want to do this yourself. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/params
No. When you add columns and rows to the table, you at it to a cache list, before printing the list, the data in the cache list needs to be organized then stylized, so it gets dumped into a final list. The final list is the list that gets modified and manipulated. The cache list never gets touched though, but it does get tracked for modifications. So let’s say you build the table then print it, then print it again, normally the data would be rebuilt again for the second print, but for us, it doesn’t unless the cache was modified after being printed, then it would need to be rebuilt. This is an optimization feature that no other table has. So let’s say you make a table with 1000 rows and 10 columns, and it takes 15 ms to build. You print it. Let’s say you print it again, as long as you don’t add anymore rows or modify the tables styling, it will take 0 ms to build because the whole build process then gets skipped because no modifications were detected. Awesome right?
What about a jagged array? it looks like you deal with same number of elements really well, what about when there is different about of elements per line? 
Explain?

Wouldnt your app be holding duplicate versions of the data in memory then? I would rather take the extra processing time than only be able to hold half the data in memory: especially if I want to hold more data than half the size of my RAM. Or, I should say I would rather write my own ten lines of code to print the data than use your lib.
Well XML for instance say we flattened XML to 1 Attribute \ value per line This always leads to a different number of elements per line for the output. Can your tool handle this?
This isn’t the 90’s, we don’t have to worry that much about memory usage. Unless you’re planning on creating a table with several thousands of rows and columns, there won’t be an issue. Also if you have it inside of your own method and if you don’t hold onto the object, just use it one time, garbage collection will take care of it after it’s done being used. So no, it won’t be an issue at all and if you think it will be one, it’s very easy to disable this optimization in the code. And it’s a lot more than 10 lines of code, it’s 165 so far.
I think this is part of inferred type or explicit type argument. If you're going to infer type with var you would go all the way.
I think I get what you are saying. You’re talking about dealing with data that could have multiple columns at any given time. Unfortunately, my tool does not support such a feature but it will be one I will actively look into. For my table, the number of cells in a row must be equal to the number of columns. So if you have 2 columns, First and Last names, and try to add a row with First, Last, and ID, an exception will be thrown. Dynamically expanding the table is not a feature but is one I will definitely look into just for you, sounds like it could be pretty handy.
I like your honesty, and your explanation of what it can do. I will look into your tool further!! Thank you.
RemindMe! 10 days
Thank you! Hope it meets your expectations!
Same here, though none of them do what I really need: support multiple assert failures in one report. 
In my last project I wanted to hold 20 million items in memory and could not. Does your library save the table to disk to access it statically because that sounds like unnecessary and expensive IO calls. Or does your lib actually do low-level memory allocation to your RAM? That sounds cool but dangerous. 
I take it you’re new to programming? You should look into garbage collection, it’s a wonderful thing to have! Also I don’t expect any computer to hold that much in memory unless it’s a render farm, server, or clustered super computer. Also, if you’re dealing with 20 million items, which I doubt you are, I don’t know why you would want to display that into a console or save it into a text file? I think you would have something more intricate and cloud based to process all that information. I don’t think you understand the use of this library.
Well, I tried to put breakpoints in there and it stops here: internal async Task StopTask() { if (_modeTask == null) return; _cancellationToken.Cancel(); try { await _modeTask; // This probably causes deadlock } } Currently running task is this: internal async Task Static(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { while (true) { cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); _ledStrip.FillLedsWithColor(); LightLeds(); await Task.Delay(5, cancellationToken); } } I think I am still missing something in case of tasks. Should I also make those FillLedsWithColor and LightLeds async? How? I tried LightLeds() like this and it's still not working. Is this correct? internal async Task LightLeds() { if (!_serial.IsOpen()) return; await Task.Run(() =&gt; { for (int i = 0; i &lt; StaticValues.NumLeds; i++) { _serial.Write((byte) i, _ledStrip.Leds[i].LedColor.R, _ledStrip.Leds[i].LedColor.G, _ledStrip.Leds[i].LedColor.B); } _serial.LightUp(); }); } &amp;#x200B;
No, my dude, that is not what static means in the .NET framework. It is static because it cannot be instantiated, thus it has no instance. Try reading some documentation: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-class-members](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-class-members). And I am familiar with Garbage Collection, which is why your lib would be garbage for C#. If you had actually written a C-based lib to somehow override the garbage collector and mapped your own allocation to ram so you do not hold duplicate data objects that persist throughout the application. My target environment could not hold it all in memory and I never said it did. I said I wanted to, but could not and had to program with RAM limitations in mind. It had a considerable processing time and the end user would have liked to know the results in real time. I could have used something like this to print the results of what I did with the data, but maybe not because I wouldn't want to slow it down with unnecessary IO calls. Also, here are two functions that prints a table(or array of arrays of strings) to the console in under ten lines (not counting method names): `public static string AddBlanks(string data, int max){` `for(int i = data.Length; i &lt; max; i++) { data += " "; }` `return data;` `}` &amp;#x200B; `public static void WriteArrays(string[][] arrays){` `var max = 0;` `arrays.ToList().ForEach(x =&gt; x.ToList().ForEach(y =&gt; { if (y.Length &gt; max) max = y.Length; }));` `foreach(var array in arrays) {` `foreach (var data in array){` `Console.Write(AddBlanks(data, max));}` `Console.WriteLine(""); }` `}` &amp;#x200B;
As I said before, I think you should brush up on your programming before telling me how my library works.
Here it is in less lines: `public static void WriteToTable(Object[] objs)` `{` `objs.ToList().ForEach(x =&gt; Console.WriteLine(x.ToString()));` `}` `public string ToString()` `{` `return "var1 var2 var3 var4";` `}`
The update function is called from unity every frame, when the script, that inherits monobehavior is attatched to a game object, that is added to the current scene
It probably uses the icon from the programs top-level window.
I am not telling you how your library works, I am asking and speculating. " A [static](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static) class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be instantiated. " - Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) Not sure where I am wrong though because you give no references, but do give false information. Does your library classes have to be instantiated, even once? Then it is not a static class. Does it hold your data in memory twice for the duration of its life? Then its just inefficient. I am also willing to bet that the milliseconds you apparently save are lost in other parts of your application, like tracking changes or having to update two different objects every insert. If someone's purpose is to print the same table a million times, then congratulations: your library did something good. 
I would only make LightLeds async if it has some process that may take a bit of time that will noticeably block the UI (this is the general rule of thumb for any time you want to make a method async). If at this point, if you are awaiting every task, and you are not doing .Wait()/.Result() or anything blocking like that, I am not sure why you would be getting deadlocked. Maybe read [this](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html) and see if it triggers any ideas. Hoping someone else can point out something I may have missed.
LightLeds takes 7ms to send data to Arduino and it is being executed often so I think it makes sense Yes, I have .Wait() only on that Disconnect() method. &amp;#x200B; Anyway thank you for all your help!

Sounds interesting, is it open source?
I 100% plan on making it open source, once I've rewritten it. The current test implementation pretty much has all the code needed, but it's a complete mess and needs to be completely refactored. There're also some extra features I'd like to implement, like being able to set the RGB values of the 16 console colors in code, and (if the APIs allow for it) also setting the font face and size. OP's post has made me look at the project again, so I might actually start working on it again now. That is, if I'm not too tired after work.
What you just described sounds exactly like the time to instantiate the objects. Since you don't have the source posted yet, I can't see it, but "adding columns and rows to the table" is just adding objects to a Table type, right? like Table.AddRow(someObject) or Table.AddRow(someListOfStrings)? Your cache optimization sounds no different than just storing the entire thing in memory. Is it somehow different than that? You have made lots of references to optimizations that you've made and the comparable speed of your library to others. Could you provide benchmarks for this, and give some examples of competing libraries?
Why don't you just post the source since you're open sourcing this anyway? Your tone is very accusatory, you should work on your approach to community engagement.
As I said before, please learn how to program before coming here and telling me how it works. I don’t think you grasp the idea of a static object just yet, but I wouldn’t too if I wasn’t programming for almost a decade.
That’s not a table, but good try?

The parameters entered are put into an array. Arrays are confined by a maximum size (~2GB) and a max length (~2-4 Billion elements).

I've deleted my code so many times I don't even know anymore. public Form3() { InitializeComponent(); } int Counter = 0; private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { int secretPassword; secretPassword = int.Parse(textBox1.Text); pictureBox1.Visible = false; if () }

Good explanation there. One of us has quoted and linked to the documentation on Static Objects in C# by the people who made C#, but apparently you know more about their language than them? I've tried to give the courtesy of not making personal accusations towards you (something you have not reciprocated). I would not say I am experienced, but I do actually get paid as a Software Developer and am capable of reading and quoting documentation. Whatever level of experience you have means nothing in an argument where all you give is opinions against facts (sourced facts). 
You should break down what you need to do into smaller pieces... Maybe first start by creating an Image object and load an image file. Once you have that done try and see if you can display the image in your picture box control. 
Are you trying to say that an array of objects is not the same thing as a table or that this will not print out something similar to your posted picture?
It’s not similar at all, go troll another post.
TL:DR If you think you can do it much better then make your own library, I’m waiting.
Releasing it on Github without internet?
Update() happens every frame. It's Unity's game update loop. FixedUpdate() is similar but happens every n milliseconds - it does physics and stuff. He'll need to look at using DateTime, or Unity's Time.time float, to get it happening once a second. Or he could accrue... Time.deltaTime (I think?) until he's got a second of elapsed time.
Wait, someone just pointed out that I posted this on my cake day!
I'm not arguing for a *specific* "standard build process", I'm argueing for anything BUT "this build process".
Why would I make a library that I don't think anybody will need or use? And I already posted two different methods that achieve your table printing in under ten lines of code. I gave you my code. Myself and everyone here are still waiting for your code.
 int Counter = 0; private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { int secretPassword; int Counter; Counter = +1; secretPassword = int.Parse(textBox1.Text); if (secretPassword == 12345) { pictureBox1.Visible = true; } else { if (Counter &lt; 3) { MessageBox.Show("Try again"); } else { MessageBox.Show("Button disabled"); button1.Enabled = false; } I can't get the Counter function to work.
Okay, and there are several uses for this library and if there weren’t, 100+ people wouldn’t like it and I wouldn’t be having people ask for it. But that’s cool? And your code is as garbage as you and your comments are. You call yourself a programmer which is quite humorous considering the fact that my library is, as the title suggests, formatting table text. You provided code that just prints off pre defined values, as simple as a hello world program. Unless you are inquiring information about my library, or adding to it, jump off this post. You, and your trolling provide no value to this sub, or even this post. You are just an eye sore to the community. And I highly doubt you are getting paid to do any type of programming seeing how you don’t even know the benefits of static members, and garbage collection. You have been blocked.
No, waiting until I get home. It’s actually taking a lot longer than I expected. My apologies for the delay!
I agree with you. So many different frameworks and tools out there these days. What's wrong with plain old shell, cmd and msbuild :)
I'll make sure to link to this comment chain when you post the code so the community can decide who is an eye sore who insults others when asked for explanation. 
I justify my actions completely. He did not ask for an explanation but insisted and even stated that my library is garbage. So make sure you tell them that first, then post the comment chain so everyone knows why I defended myself, defended my library I busted my ass on, and blocked him. Cheers!
Actually I'm gonna have a busy evening so simply take a tip from 3rd person view. Even if someone calls your code garbage after you , you don't insult the person. If someone asks you a question, you either answer or you don't. You don't go "this isn't 90s blah blah blah" or "I take it you're new to programming". Do NOT be condescending if you want to be respected in open source community. Don't avoid memory optimization questions if you advertise this library as optimized. 20M objects is quite believable in certain data processing cases. You don't need a "cloud" to process that. There's a reason MSFT is going to great lengths to optimize such simple things like string processing and storage to speed up json output in asp net core. Good luck with the release.
This whole comment chain has made me lose respect for you. When I first saw this project I was excited and wanted to check it out. But seeing how you react to negative feedback is really off putting. You actually said you doubt /u/TinderTroll8 is a paid programmer when you know absolutely nothing about him other then he doesn't seem to like or understand your project. That's completely asinine all because he doesn't agree with your project. You really should learn to ignore people you believe are trolling you.
Https://GitHub.com/brettsschmidt/better tableprinter There is my GitHub project for this, where is yours? I'll admit I came off rough, but I have backed and supported everything I have said. You have just repeatedly attacked me personally and not supported any of your claims. It's mind boggling to me how you can read a quote from Microsoft and still think static classes are "instantiated once". Where have you read that? Considering you could not catch the implication that var1 and var2 are different variables leads me to believe that you are not as experienced as you say. We are also all programmers here. We can all iterate through an array of objects and format our own text. It would be more time consuming to learn a library that requires your dll which was made by someone who does not know what a static object is. If someone does not know how to iterate through an array or format text (like you I assume) then they should read documentation and learn it instead of using your currently non-existent library. If they wanted to they could even reference mine to see how it's done.

You should not feel intimidated to contribute code to PowerShell. It was written by mere mortals... [Some of the code for Format-Table](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d80154430d600a52a1d1e3a9f3ecf032b36185d4/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/common/BaseFormattingCommand.cs) I am curious whether you investigated creating a PowerShell runspace and using it to format your objects as an alternative to doing it yourself. Did you have a performance constraint?
I’ve never understood why I need Cake in the first place. My CI/CD (like Azure DevOps or Jenkins) should be doing the stuff it does. 
You can use regular expressions to accomplish this. Either on the client or server side. For c# it should be in the System.Text namespace. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex?view=netframework-4.7.2
IMO, your build process should never be tied to your build server. Your build scripts should be standalone, and your build server should simple invoke \`\`\`./build.sh ci\`\`\`, or w/e.
Build, yes ... I agree. But if you need some other than what you can do with hitting F5 in VS to build then you are probably doing something more complicated than you need to.

Each time you click button1 this method is called, each time this method is called you are declaring a new int named Counter. I think what you really want is a class level variable to keep track of the count. What you need to understand (and google) here is Variable Scope. The scope of Counter is completely contained within the curly braces of the button1\_Click method, so Counter is born in that method, lives in that method, and dies when execution hits the last curly brace of button1\_Click. You probably want something like this: public class MyClass { private int SubmittalAttempts; public void SubmitButtonClick() { SubmittalAttempts++; // do stuff } }
use the regex expression: \d{1,3}[Dd]\d{1,3} This socery works in the following way: \d{1,3} means it must find one to three digits, then [Dd] means it must find either an uppercase D or lowercase d, and then \d{1,3} means it must find another 1-3 digits. Thus 111d666 would match as long as it follows that format (1-3 digital, d or D, 1 - 3 digits). You can see how it works at the following url that I've created. https://regexr.com/49ucb Every piece of text that is highlighted means it found a valid match. You can enter different tests in the textbox.

Then what exactly is the MIT License for?
Here's a source you can use to help you decide: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/). Pay attention to the condition of including a copyright notice.
It's a little bit more permissive as far as I understand. 
There are many ways to accomplish this. C# has model validation built in that, combined with @theSeanage 's answer could possibly handle this for you. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc3/cs/adding-validation-to-the-model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc3/cs/adding-validation-to-the-model) but, My recommendation to someone at your level of understanding is to accomplish this through an abstraction. One of the main things you should be learning at this level is how to apply (or at least attempt to apply) the Single Responsibility Principle. All of those if/else statements that are validating the input live in a class that should only be responsible for showing a view. What if you had a class that handles this for you? Then this code would be much smaller and clearer. Something like public class DiceInput { private string _input; public DiceInput(string input) { _input = input; } public bool IsValid() { // check _input against all your logic or a regex or whatever } } &amp;#x200B; Then in your ViewModel or CodeBehind it is as simple as &amp;#x200B; var diceInput= new DiceInput(userInput); if(diceInput.IsValid()) { // do stuff } **Then write Unit Tests for DiceInput.** Yes, I know this is way beyond what OP asked for and way heavy handed for a homework assignment but for the love of Pete, we need devs that think about tests and testable code.
I would love to use this library.
I don’t understand the statement. Are you saying that F5 must be enough?
When using an older programming language. This book is a failure when it comes to teaching design patterns and the broader concept id pattern languages. I say this for many reasons, one of which is that it doesn't take into consideration how we need different patterns in different languages to accomplish the same goal. 
Thanks for the responses yall. This was basically what I needed: int Counter = 0; private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { int secretPassword; Counter= Counter +1; secretPassword = int.Parse(textBox1.Text); if (secretPassword == 12345) { pictureBox1.Visible = true; } else { if (Counter &lt; 3) { MessageBox.Show("Try again"); } else { MessageBox.Show("Button disabled"); button1.Enabled = false; }

Are you doing it from SQL or in C#? Are you able to use: Select Description from Entry_Booking_RoomLocation where description not in (select description from Entry_category_Ikp) or in C#, !Entry_Booking_RoomLocation_Ikp.Description.Contains(Entry_category_Ikp) or use .IndexOf(Description, String.Comparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) . Find whatever one you want.
I’m most of the time it is. I’ve seen very large projects (millions of lines of code) that have the goal of being able to clone the repo, open the solution, and be able to hit F5 to build. Hence I’m curious what you are using Cake to do. 
Open Office doesn't have a replacement for Excel. It is an alternative but it isn't even on the same level.
Build automation is not reduced to building a project. It usually includes pushing artifacts, deploying the application, generating documentation, executing tests, generating reports, running code analysis, calculating version numbers, and much more. 
If that is what you are including, then I stand by original assertion that I rely on my CI/CD to do those things. They generally have built in tasks to do a lot of what I want to, extensions for more, and last resort the ability to run scripts in my repo. 
See here https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/azlzqn/comment/ei98qij I’m not trying to convince you here. But there are reasonable drawbacks when using _only_ CI servers for BA.
Fair statements, they can be a bitch to debug when things go wrong. I’m not that worried about lock in, though. 
I like this better than using var, but I do worry it will be abused when used in a method call. As a general rule I think it is best to avoid used with a method call.
I highly recommend reading this article by Sarah Drasner, where she explains her method of learning new technologies. https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/

I agree with the LGPL. MIT means anyone can take your code, modify it, and never share those modifications with anyone else. LGPL would ensure that your library remains open and that you are properly credited.

You can have a look in [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/), it can be useful 👍
I don't get it. This is pretty simple to do with a for loop and a few statements. Maybe a single class. Pass in an array of objects a list of properties to "print", look for longest string of each property to determine column width, maybe truncate if Max row length... Maybe 10mins programming to get it mostly/completely working... 
I ran some basic tests, and it looks like you don't need to reload you entities. At least for me, the EF always queried them from the Database. The way I was doing: 1. Call Update() on root entry (Model1) 2. Foreach in db.Entry(mod1).References 3. Set each reference (related model)'s state to Unchanged This 3rd point was the problematic in my head. Since there is an "empty" Model2 in the collections (if EF has any) I was afraird that EF will return this empty when I query Model2's (to reduce Database calls). But in reality, it just simply reloads all Model2 from the DB (at least in my cases). Worth a mention that I don't do anything else in the same API call, and the data is re-queried in the next API call.
You'd be surprised at how much you can learn about a seemingly-complex project by picking a random issue or feature you're interested in and trying to figure out how to implement it. The process of merely configuring your environment and IDE to build/run/debug the project can grant loads of incidental insight into the high-level architecture that previously seemed terrifying and unapproachable.
Thank you!
It’s more complex than that, and the point of using libraries is so you don’t have to write the code yourself. :)
Net Standard 2.0 ships with lots of System.X assembly “shims”. I’m Presuming this one is included. You can expand the NetStandard package in your project and view everything that is included as part of that package. https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2016/nov/23/net-standard-20-making-sense-of-net-again
I think this shim is not included because the project fails to build in linux with this package installed.
Makes sense then. I would contact the project author to see if they can fix it, or if they aren’t willing to change it, fork the repo and fix it yourself and then republish your own version of the package to Nuget. 
happy microphone day buddy
The `System.Drawing.Common` is from Microsoft. What I fail to understand is why it would be included in .NET Standard 2.0 if it depends on Win32 package?
Because they are shims. Replacements for the original windows packages. Like CURL under the hood for System.Net.HttpClient on Linux. Based on what platform your build is targeting it uses the correct platform version. 
Sure, you can think what you want. It’s objectively not ancient, though, and is used widely still. Of course not much in *new* products, but most aren’t. 
I get it is more complicated than that with all the extra functionality, but the basic functionality which would cover 90% of uses, isnt that complex. Loading libraries makes apps bigger. A single file on github is a good way of doing it, a nuget package is good for easy access. I've had to do something very similar for a print out, it wasnt that much work, we used it in our unit tests to print out the results. basically a 20ish line function. If optimizing for speed sure it may be more work and more code. But if speed isnt super important (cos lets face it, unless youre iterating millions of objects a for loop wouldnt be that slow, millseconds).
&gt; I thought the idea of .NET Standard is a set of APIs that is common on all platforms? On all runtimes/frameworks, yes. The goal is chiefly to have a common baseline beteeen .NET Framework, .NEY Core, Xamarin, etc. Mostly, that also means working on all platforms those support. So if you reference it from a .NET Core project, you should get Linux and macOS support for free. But. Nothing prevents you from P/Invoking from a .NET Standard library.
Keeps going forever because Unity's function Update from MonoBehaviour is called every single frame, it will never stop unless you do gameObject.enabled = false, but the will disable de object 
Hey! I shared the same idea. Dude started personally coming at me. I think the mod deleted it, but his "extra functionality" is just holding your data in memory two more times.
Actually, it seems that I have the same issue with your method as well. I can't get the type of the model into SelectedModelType, despite using the fully qualified name. Type.GetType(obj) returns null, so I can never serialize the xml to that object.
Cheers for that. I have hundreds of classes (models), there are very few in there that actually have a constructor.
I'd recommend both, CLR via C# and C# in depth. I've mailed Jon Skeet about the "in-depth advice" about an . Where should I start? He replied like this &amp;#x200B; &gt; Hi Karthik, &gt; &gt;Reading the specification is a good start - see [http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter1/Specifications.aspx](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter1/Specifications.aspx) for links. &gt; &gt;Beyond that, experimentation and curiosity account for an awful lot... I like investigating corner cases. &amp;#x200B; Knowing how everything works is as important as experimenting the So, it's better get your hands dirty by experimenting code and knowing &amp;#x200B;

&gt; What's wrong with plain old shell, cmd and msbuild :) That you'll end up with a lot of boiler plate if you need the same flexibility that systems like Cake have?
&gt; Threads aren't tied to security and I've never seen a security issue around their implementation. However it's totally possible any badly implemented code could have security ramifications. On Windows, threads have effective users, i.e. they perform operations as some Windows identity that can be different from the process as a whole.
&gt; Will there be any drawbacks if I make main method async? No, doing that is essentially the same as: static void Main() { MainCore().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); } static async void MainCore() { // your main method } 
I didn't know you could make the main method async. Is there some special configuration you need? I'm pretty sure I tried once and got errors. Also, if you use .wait() would that be thread blocking?

You could use your phone as a usb tether / WiFi hotspot, and download the dotnet CLI, c# plugin and the code runner plugin for Vs code, then you are sorted.
Hotspot and tethering isn't an option for me unfortunately but I might be able download the extension from my phone and transfer it to my PC like I did with the the omnisharp c# extension. Do you know if the the downloads are in the Microsoft market place? 
Which platform are you on, phone and computer
Yes, it's provided by ReSharper. It doesn't actually do anything on its own, however.
&gt; After reading that, I would say I am not ready for such a packet It's not one, it's several loosely related packages.
Even more in Mono with int64 array indexes enabled. Though I've never seen anyone use them.
For the first question, I would say Math.NET Numerics could replace at least a subset of functionalities provided by numpy.

After quick look at [Math.NET](https://Math.NET) documentation I must admit that it looks promising.

The replacement for itertools in C# is Linq as for your third question, I think all of Linq is implemented with yield 
If you're new to programming, don't try to fight the system. Take the easiest learning path and follow the tutorials to the letter; then, when you are more knowledgeable, you can try to customise your coding environment.
I think I understand, so something like this then? public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page { private CompanyService _companyService; public void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { _companyService = new CompanyService(new ApplicationDbContext()); } private async Task AddTaskToAllCompanies(BusinessTask task) { var companies = _companyService.Load(); foreach (var company in companies) { company.Tasks.Add(task); _companyService.Update(_db, company, false); } } } public class CompanyService { private ApplicationDbContext _db; public CompanyService(ApplicationDbContext context) { _db = context; } }
In windows we prefer using multiple threads in contrast to initiating a new process (which takes too much overhead). Considering most modern processors are multi-core Thread objects allows us parallel execution as well. In most cases we use Thread objects to isolate long running tasks from the main Thread (think of frozen GUI waiting for code to execute). Thread.Sleep() is inefficient as it locks thread completely. Today we use mostly Task objects (TPL) which are nice way working with Thread Pool. In such cases Task.Delay() is preferred method of execution as it won't lock thread (CLR can assign some other task to the available threads while waiting). To my knowledge there is no security risk in using threads.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcallowverylargeobjects-element ** On 64-bit platforms, enables arrays that are greater than 2 gigabytes (GB) in total size.**
Why it is bad? It'd be bad if someone did something like that: result.Result.Length &gt; 0 then display
&gt;Allocating threads using Task.Run() are more isolated which can help prevent you affecting performance outside of your app No, we use TPL because it is just a nicer way of working with Thread Pool. Thread Pool gives greater efficiency and lower overhead compared to manually initiating Thread object.

Isn't ExcelDNA just for creating functions using .NET ?
Excel is "obsolete" ??? What ??? :) In what world you live in... 
Using COM to access Excel ? OMG... Excel is now using OpenXml standard, why the hell you want to use COM ?
You can always use VSTO, but only if you don't have any other option left.
It is something MS should have built 10 years while they were still holding huge NO TO OPENSOURCE sign. Don't use it unless you really have to. "old" .NET framework is still way to go for next few years.
Will do
I've been using .NET since 1.1 release and I still haven't moved to WPF. I simply refuse. My advice is that you don't waste your time on something which will most likely be obsolete in near future. Let me give you a historic review of all GUI technologies MS invented so far: Win32(Win API), MFC, ATL, WTL, WinForms, WinRT (Metro), WPF, UWP. &amp;#x200B; Learn web technologies, that is at least more or less consistent.
Removed: Rule 1, Rule 4.
Me too! :P
Do you want them both to run at the same time?
&gt; I thought the idea of .NET Standard is a set of APIs that is common on all platforms? That's a common misconception. .Net Standard is not (primarily) about being cross-platform but cross-framework. What it means is that the same library can run and be executed on either .Net Framework, .Net Core, mono (and other implementations of the standard). Sometimes there are also cross-platform, which is nice but not always. If they have dependency to platform-specific API, then either there is a re-implementation of that API for another platform or it stays platform-specific. In the present case, GDI+ is Windows-specific.
 public string Topping { get; set; } Is called an auto property. You can write it all out yourself, if you like private string _topping; public string Topping { get { return _topping; } set { _topping = value; ] }
does it automatically create : private string _topping; for example if i wanted to call _topping inside the class
Hey! Maybe it's easy to understand with an example. &amp;#x200B; Imagine you want to use the "Topping" property to set and get values of the "topping" string variable. &amp;#x200B; You can do something of the sort: Public string Topping { get =&gt; topping; set =&gt; topping = value; } &amp;#x200B; or the equivalent &amp;#x200B; Public string Topping { get { return topping; } set { topping = value; } } &amp;#x200B; and use any by: &amp;#x200B; (Setting topping to a new topping) Topping = "Cheese"; (Getting the topping) string whatTopping = Topping; &amp;#x200B; you can also do other stuff like: &amp;#x200B; float health; &amp;#x200B; Public bool IsDead { get =&gt; health &lt;= 0; } &amp;#x200B; If you ever called "IsDead" it would return true if health was equal or below to 0 or false if otherwise.
[https://i.imgur.com/pRto4FR.png](https://i.imgur.com/pRto4FR.png) [https://i.imgur.com/3R8QrsK.png](https://i.imgur.com/3R8QrsK.png)
It works like that internally but when using an auto property you only have access to that property, which means you access it just like how anything else accesses the value through the property: public string Topping { get; set; } private bool CheckIfToppingIsEmpty() { // Topping here is then the property above return Topping == string.Empty; } Not used to explaining how code works, sorry if the explanation is confusing
Auto getter/setter simply generates private field when converting to CIL. I am not sure if CIL converter would associate topping field with Topping property (you can check that out by decompiling your assembly to IL, check out ILSpy). But even if it does it's bad practice imho. What you actually want is either auto property with private setter so backing field is generated automatically and you don't care about it's name &amp;#x200B; class Pizza { public string Topping {get; private set;} } &amp;#x200B; or getter setter with explicit backing field &amp;#x200B; class Pizza { private Topping \_topping public string Topping { get {return \_topping;} private set {\_topping = value;} } &amp;#x200B; the second one is useful if you need to invoke some logic whenever property is changed &amp;#x200B;
Well, you can consider them as syntactic sugar for get &amp; set methods. ( With one difference being that the CLR interpret them as properties, but as a beginner you can ignore that ). &amp;#x200B; You can see it as the equivalent of having a field, and having a get &amp; set method for that field. &amp;#x200B; This `public class Pizza` `{` `private string _topping;` `public string GetTopping()` `{` `return _topping;` `}` `public void SetTopping(string topping)` `{` `_topping = topping;` `}` `}` &amp;#x200B; is the equivalent of this `public class Pizza` `{` `public string Topping { get; set; }` `}`
Does this make sense? Is there a better way to do this? private static IEnumerable&lt;IntervalMaster&gt; Unfold(List&lt;IntervalMaster&gt; listItems) { var index = 0; var nextValue = listItems[index]; while (true) { yield return nextValue; index = (index + 1) % listItems.Count; Thread.Sleep(nextValue.Interval *1000); nextValue = listItems[index]; } } public IntervalSetter(List&lt;IntervalMaster&gt; intervalMasters) { Subject = Observable.Create&lt;string&gt;(o =&gt; { foreach (var item in Unfold(intervalMasters)) { o.OnNext(item.Text); } //Incorrect disposal pattern return Disposable.Empty; }); public IObservable&lt;string&gt; Subject; } I can subscribe to this observable in some class I need. Kindly suggest
For the first question I would say \`System.Numerics\`: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics?view=netframework-4.7.2)
 class Pizza { public string Topping { get; set; } } is syntactic sugar for class Pizza { private string topping; public string Topping { get { return topping; } set { topping = value; } } } which is (kinda) snytactic sugar for class Pizza { private string topping; public string GetTopping() { return topping; } public void SetTopping(string topping) { this.topping = topping; } } 
Ah i see, Thank you for clarification
I'm not sure... Maybe? Because the func2 uses the func1 data, and func1 retrieves updates the data each day?
No, it doesn't. It handles that stuff internally, which means you cannot get a name conflict. In your example, the "topping" variable is never used, and even if you named it "_topping", it wouldn't be used.
is it just the same as declaring the attribute as public?
I would also avoid doing queries after \`SaveChanges\` on the same \`DbContext\` instance/lifetime. I'm curious how you're generating the \`Model1\` and its related entity when you POST back the data from UI. Why not query the related entities from the database there using their IDs? That may be more intuitive.
Are you talking about https://www.mathdotnet.com/? I took at look at the one you linked above, and it doesn't look like it has anything to do with .NET.
Probably be easier if you formatted the code, though ;)
I don't think the second one is useful in C#. You can invoke your custom logic on an auto-property as well, so there's no real benefit to actually declaring the field.
No! The public Attribute cannot be databound either and also you cannot have finegrained access control with a public variable. public string Topping { get; } ...allows the user of the object to only Access the value, but not to overwrite it. similarly: public strong Topping { public set; private get; } With variables, you cannot do that at all, they are either accessible of not. Also you can have setters that compute values instead of just storing them: public double TemperatureKelvin{ get; set; } public double TemperatureCelsius { get { return TemperatureKelvin - 273.15; } set { TemperatureKelvin = value + 273.15; } } 
&gt; I'm not sure... Then use the same lock object for both. This ensures only one or the other can run at any given time. 
The workflow is: The UI runs the: [HttpGet] IAsyncResult Edit(string model1Code) It queries the model by the code, then sends it to the Razor page, that displays the editor fields. The related fields are displayed in a DropdownList. When you press the Save button, all the Model1's field are sent back, because they was in an input. BUT... the related fields was in a DropdownList, hence only their ID getting sent back. &amp;#x200B; They arrive into a [HttpPost] IAsyncResult Edit(Model1 model) mehod, that calls the `db.Model1s.Update(model)` method. BUT... since the Update() will do a recursive lookup on the related fields (who knows why?) it will find all the Model2 that is related by the Model1. But since those Model2s came from a DropdownList, only their ID column has data, all other property is null. And since the Update() began to track all Model2, when calling SaveChanged(), it will update all Model2 with the "new" values. And since all the Model2s' properties are NULL except for the ID, it will set all column to NULL in the database too. &amp;#x200B; What I would need is an Update() method, that does NOT do a recursive lookup, but only starts to track the root model itself, and nothing else.
Hahahaha, indeed, didnt know one could do such a thing, dont mind my ignorance :p
Did you get a chance to post it up yet? Sorry if I missed the link somewhere. 
No. The {get; set;} syntax actually creates the methods, on compile. I’m not sure what your background is, but, if you’re coming from Java, the {get; set;} syntax (and properties, in general) really fill the same niche as the Bean spec. In fact, if you were to look at the IL, you’d see that `public string Topping {get; set;}` Actually compiles to `private string topping; public string getTopping() { return topping;} public void setTopping(string value) { topping = value; }` (Note: that may not be _exactly_ correct, but pretty close. There are some special characters involved that you can’t actually use in C#.) Because they really are properties, anything using reflection (say, Entity Framework or ASP.NET MVC wizards) to check for properties will pick them up as such. Additionally, if the application evolves to where you need a backing variables, guard clauses, or otherwise expand the auto property to a full property, you can without it introducing side effects.
Yep, just Reddit things.
But what's to stop someone from incorrectly constructing it? Or if you need more than just a "it didn't work"? These were the questions that led my team to move to Either as a safer alternative. We've found other benefits with this approach like being just step up a main entry point into a logic path and make that entry point responsible for orchestration via calls to Either's map, flatmap, bimap, do right, do left and "match" which reduces a union type to a single type (which I think is what Haskell's bimap does but we implemented bimap as taking two functions that go from TSuccess to TSuccess' and TError to TError')
&gt; You can invoke your custom logic on an auto-property as well Not really. For example, to use `INotifyPropertyChanged` on a property, you already cannot use `{ get; set; }` (without special tooling like Fody). You'll need to change from the fairly simple public string Topping { get; set; } To something like the rather convoluted: private string _Topping; public string Topping { get =&gt; _Topping; set { _Topping = value; PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(Topping)); } } You can refactor portions of that setter into its own method, but you _cannot_ use auto properties.
Will be posted at 5 PM EST today!
that's a bit brutal but true. In case of heavy-weight ORM it almost non-sense to use anything else except EF Core, it's hard to beat fact that it is maintained and promoted by MS. In legacy projects some data layer already exists, and usually it remains the same forever. For new data-layer libs it is important to have some differentiator, some niche where it is the best (hehe). For example, my lib [nreco/data](https://github.com/nreco/data) is good for schema-less CRUD operations and dynamic runtime-defined queries - (however it implements POCO-mapping like Dapper, but this is not a key differentiator of course).
I use Linqpad. It's a great little tool.
Fair point. I didn't meant to say more isolated (as it has nothing to do with security isolation or anything). I meant say it has better default resource management. Aka... when you create a new thread, it will keep allocating new resources (which makes it easier to exhaust available resources on the system). When you create a task, it may or may not allocate more resources, or reuse existing resources, or even queue up the work for when resources are available within your apps working set of resources. It optimizes all of this for you for the most part, making it harder to screw things up.
I didn't say it was obsolete. I said it was "dead-end", meaning that there won't be any further major changes to its functionality. I said it was in "maintenance mode", meaning that there won't be any further major changes to its functionality. I even said it was "old", but it *has* been around since 1985... In software-years, that's *ancient*. (And if you're wondering, software-years work kinda like dog-years.) 
Will do!
INotifyPropertyChange is an API for classes to notify others when a property in the class changes. Imagine you have a User class and want to know when a property (like Firstname) changes, you would do this with an event. The classes that want to know when a property in User changes would subscribe to this event and the event would fire with an argument that tells the subscriber which property was changed. INotifyPropertyChanged is just a generic interface that describes this kind of contract. It's used heavily in .NET UI applications when classes that model that data the UI is showing change, you want the UI to update. ----- I'm guessing you get a null type because the assembly that contains the Type isn't loaded (or able to load). Are the assemblies containing the types you want to create in the same folder as your app? That is easy fix 1. .NET loads/searches for assemblies in certain places in a certain order. Using the DLLs in the application directory first, then searching the GAC, etc. Another way is to be able to have custom directories your app can look in for these assemblies. (or obtain them some other way). You can change the way this is done by hooking into an event that is fired when assemblies are being searched for: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1561806/looking-for-net-assembly-in-a-different-place
1. For an itertools equivalent, this is the top Nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Combinatorics/ 2. Functions with yield are fairly common. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield 
Well, I'm actually doing Visio. I did write a bit of code to generate some stuff using openxml, but I never figured out how to get all the formulas calculated without opening the file with visio at the end using COM anyway, wiping out all the performance gains from generating the xml. People were opening the files with Visio Viewer, which didn't calculate the formulas, making the diagrams look like a jumbled mess.
On a phone and can't check right now, but if I recall correctly I think it is an encryption library for PGP. I could be wrong. Might've been BouncyCastle or something like that
I'd never take a job without them having to write any code in the interview. I mean, I work as C# dev, and I have to look the stupid SQL Joins up, always and every time.
That would be a "field", anything with a getter and/or setter is a "property". They have different language semantics. (Fields are common for internal class use and maybe in structs, Properties are common for public use of the class - there are other use cases, however, I just provided the very common examples). Getters and setters can have custom code to validate or do some other calculation or side-effect. See other examples in this thread. Attributes (the things you see in \[Brackets\] associated with classes, methods, fields and properties) are sometimes restricted for use on properties only and not fields (or even the other way around).
Amazing bit of code use it everywhere in fact.. :)
If they never even ask about other things you've done then it's probably a bad sign. I think getting questions like these are pretty fair though. They aren't too difficult and it's kind of just like gatekeeping so that they know that you didn't cheat/slack your way through the degree. I'd rather answer basic knowledge questions than do a mini project that requires some specific tricks any day. 
I have not tried it yet but pretty sure there is a plug-in for code.visualstudio.com there is one for everything else. I also suggest cs-scrpit.net it's what I use as well.
You can use LINQ without yield. Generating an enumerable sequence (`IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;`) using yield doesn't depend on LINQ - it's a C# compiler feature.
I always asked "is var type-safe?" I was surprised on the number of wrong answers I got there.
Great post, thanks for sharing! I've been using NUKE for the last year or so, and have since switched all my projects over. Being able to use the same tools to both configure my build and do the actual coding is a really helpful trait.
Well I was able to download VS Code and it's extensions via my phone and successfully transfered them to my PC. The problem came up when I try to install the C# extension (the main one, omnisharp) it says it can't connect to an omnisharp server and can't get something called 'downloadinstaller' or something like that. When I go and check the output window it would show an error as well, I think something about not being able to find path specified. One 'fix' (for the path specified problem) was to get the zip version of the extension, and unload directly into the user&gt;vscode&gt;extensions folder. That seemed to not show any errors but it would seemingly remove the 'net core' option, which I think is needed? 
You have 2 off everything, in this example you shouldn't need to lock anything. Unless both tasks try to work on the same data, no need for locking is required here is the perfect tutorial for correct locking: [http://www.albahari.com/threading/part2.aspx#\_Locking](http://www.albahari.com/threading/part2.aspx#_Locking)
Are these questions from the only interview? My company asks these kinds of questions during phone screening and maybe a first round interview to filter people out. Afterwards, it's all about articulating your accomplishments, real life problems you've solved, some whiteboarding and thinking through coding challenges, etc. 
Great for prototyping
 The func2 creates data by using data which was fetched by func1. But once in the day func1 updates its data. So I won't need locking? 
&gt; But what's to stop someone from incorrectly constructing it? I don't really feel it It's like "What's stoping someone from performing _context.Database.EnsureDeleted()?"
Pls use :) =&gt; [https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore)
Or maybe can we call Python in C#? Can we?
That's fair. It was something that *my team* wanted to protect against. Your team might consider otherwise. I think both are completely valid approaches to the issue, just depends on where you land on strictness (for lack of a better word)
Reddit gave me a push notification for C# properties ... Come on Reddit, you're better than that.
How? I am not aware of any syntax that allows you to run code on an auto property change.
You won't get naming conflict because compiler will generate complex name (something like "`&lt;k&gt;_topping_backingfield`" which is even illegal in plain C#). 
Also, you can change the protection of the variables with this. For example this variable could be read accessed by other classes but only modified internally. I use this for singletons in my Unity project. public float myFloat { get; private set; } 
As others have said it is one of those cases where people looked at all the typing you have to do when declaring a property with a backing store and said "You know what? This is the same thing every time. Let's make it easier for the dev to type and have the compiler write that out instead." &amp;#x200B; You can also assign default values in line with the property declaration. So for example you could have a class constructor that set the topping property to default to Cheese like this. &amp;#x200B; public Pizza() { Topping = "Cheese"; } Or you can inline that on the property itself like this public string Topping { get; set; } = "Cheese"; Accomplishes the same end result, but the second one is less typing by the dev. I imagine the IL looks about like the first example, but I've never really bothered to dig into what that looks like at that level.
i apologize!
Visual Studio. Stop hitting yourself.
[Here is the official documentation about this syntax.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties)
No special configuration. Just need to be using C# 7 or greater. Yes, if you use .Wait() or .Result() before the task is complete, it will block the current thread.

Like I said, don't feel intimidated. :-) Looks like a reference to one of a trio of similarly-named files that have some amount of consistency... * FormatAndOut_MshParameter.resx * FormatAndOut_format_xxx.resx * FormatAndOut_out_xxx.resx 
If you're interviewing for a position where you'll be doing full stack web development using C#, JavaScript and SQL then I don't see any problems with these questions. I wouldn't personally expect someone to exactly know all the details of all of these (how many people really ever use `private protected` or can list every single difference between classes and structs?) but you should at least be able to have a conversation about them.
Done. Thank you - wasn't aware that there was a standard .gitignore for this.
The answer is yes?
He didn't say that you have to yield yourself to use Linq, however Linq IS implemented using yield. This is what makes it lazy, and why nothing is evaluated until you call something that actually iterates on it. [https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/8750960d3fafa46a9b838c351e995a01fa8b599f/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Where.cs#L72](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/8750960d3fafa46a9b838c351e995a01fa8b599f/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Where.cs#L72)
I think your getting downvotes because you misunderstood my answer. I didn’t mean that you can’t use Linq without yield. I meant that the different Linq methods are implemented with yield within the .net framework's source code
I did contract work for a huge company, they migrated 100+ business spreadsheets from excel to open calc, so far we havne't run into many issues. The biggest is 3rd party vendor plugins, but everything in house was "easy" to re-write and get working. 
The answer is yes.
Good question
Can you explain what this patch does? str = str.Replace("445042", "444278"); 
This is a phone screen
For `numpy` I guess `NumSharp` is a good *numshot*. https://scisharp.github.io/NumSharp/
"var" ??? Why this question? In JS it isn't?
be careful of "can all variables be converted to object" - it is false
How is this not the top comment? it's the only one that actually answers the question asked. If I'm hiring a junior dev with any training or experience, they should be able to at least speak to all of these. A mid or senior should be able to handle these without missing a beat. Like above said, maybe they don't get every access type but at least the main ones. Obviously if there's a known gap (s/he doesn't have ____ yet but wants to learn) then you skip, maybe sub in some questions in the closest thing the candidate does have. 
I know that optimally I should be using visual studio community or VS Code but I don't really have those options for an offline PC (look at my comments in the thread). I'm not really trying to fight the system, I do wish I could take the easier routes. 
.net core is essentially just a newer, open-source version of .net It's not essential.
I forget how to debug a SQL Server stored procedure. Do you step into it in SSMS?
I always like, "What's the difference between a value type and a reference type in C#, and more importantly why do we care?" Goes directly to "Some method parameters are directly modified by default; some are copies of the data." Knowing which is which is fundamental for predicting method behavior. (Also the "Why do we care" part requires more than rote memorization of the definition; it requires application of the definition.)
I don't quite understand the question: Explain the type of access modifiers in C# Does this mean describe the different access modifiers, what they do and when to use them?
I've been bouncing around an idea in my head for a few weeks now: an expression-based, attribute-defined generic filtering library for enumerations and queryables. Something you could pass a string and value to (from, say, an Angular UI) and it would generate the Where() clause (or multiple clauses) automatically. Might be useful for UI-driven backend filtering. And it'd be a nifty POC exercise for me and first time making my own GitHub and NuGet packages.
He did say it was "light**er** weight". 
Ok, fair, I did misunderstand your question, but I think it's because LINQ operators are largely _not_ implemented with yield. Instead, the iterators are largely state machines that are implemented using `switch` statements: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/8750960d3fafa46a9b838c351e995a01fa8b599f/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Where.cs#L110
Why is this false?
To be honest, I thought you might be exaggerating about the offline PC; after all, you have to be online to post this. Anyway, [VSCode supports portable mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable). If you have access to another computer that is connected to the Internet, set up VSCode as you desire on it and transport it to your offline PC. Good luck!
Thank you for speaking with us today, but the job has already been filled, we will keep you resume on file.
C# is a strongly typed language, therefore - unless there's some ambiguity in which case you can't compile anyways - the type can always be inferred from the context when you use var. The benefits being writing less and the codebase needing less refactoring should a type or type name change. JavaScript isn't strongly typed so, var is just a variable declaration (though it has some other characteristics).
For an offline pc? They don't really require internet connection
&gt;How would you return multiple values from a method in C#? `return new Tuple&lt;string,int,string,int,double,char,float&gt;("magic_string",-1,"magic_string_2",42,1/3,'e',84f);`
Yes, absolutely. Removing VBA protection, at least in the simplest way, involves changing the vbaProject.bin file to break it. That is actually three hex couplets that designate the project protection key - "DPB". The replacement will change that to "DBx", which is a nothing key, causing the project to go through recovery the next time the workbook is opened. The recovery will not be able to find protection on the project, due to not having the correct key, and will strip it away. When the workbook is saved and reopened, the protection is no longer there. &amp;#x200B; Hopefully that made sense.
I don't think directly writing code is 100% necessary. I've been shown a piece of code, given half an hour and told "what's wrong with this code, why, and how would you fix it". Doesn't require you to write linked lists for the umphteenth time, and it actually requires some real critical thinking. I liked it much more than coding something from scratch.
Its not /always/ strongly typed. You could use a ´dynamic´ variable if you're fine with burning in eternal hellfire
The point is, these questions can be answered from memory, it doesn't mean the person can be an effective developer. Like I said, there isn't discussion about what I've accomplished and any coding.
In this case, yes, only interview. I missed one or two of them and got disqualified, but there was probably more to it. I didn't have good chemistry with the group.
Those are entry level questions for a junior position where c# is the main backend language so no problems
Roslynpad is good free alternative. But it has a lot less features.
"In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from Object. You can assign values of any type to variables of type object. When a variable of a value type is converted to object, it is said to be *boxed*. When a variable of type object is converted to a value type, it is said to be *unboxed*." Not sure what OP means, but he/she can explain. &amp;#x200B;
Yes
Oh right. I chose to forget that exists.
u/samofny Neither pointer types nor ref structs can be boxed. E.g ``` int x; object z = &amp;x; // error``` ``` object z = new Span&lt;byte&gt;(); // error ```
I think I said to return a Dictionary or List or Array, depending on what you want.
I have never felt Language Specific/syntax questions were worthwhile. These are things that take 10 seconds to google. I prefer conceptual questions. 
Haha i got a tool monitoring your GitHub account, I'll let everyone know if you were late ;)
Ok first of all if you use I ==3, it will only be true if i is 3. The problem is you are continuing Increasing I value and in next updates you if statement will be false. What you want is either check if I is above 3 if(i&gt;= 3), or increase I only if it is below 3. 
I would only have one question.... \&gt; **What's your Github username?**
Yeah that's pretty harsh. I use questions like these on a phone screen to weed out complete bullshitters. Doesn't seem like you are one. It's especially odd because government contractors generally just want a warm body, delivering a working product is not generally necessary for them. 
Actually dynamic is still strongly typed the thing is it will only have a concrete type at runtime
This is a perfect example of when comments are useful. 
Not all these questions are even C# questions. It looks like these interviews are trying to fill web development roles. The most popular job categories are going to get this kind of one-size-fits-all treatment. My guess is that this is just an initial interview that gets you to the next step. You should have a chance to talk about your code and accomplishments at a later phase. That said, as an experienced C# dev, the C# questions are pretty basic and unambiguous (except one), so it doesn't throw any red flags about the company for me. I don't like the dependency injection question because it relies on a vocabulary term you may not know, despite possibly knowing the concept intuitively. Unless of course the interviewer describes what dependency injection is. Other than that one, I think a C# developer should be able to answer all the C# questions. What says more about the company is whether there is any discussion after a failed answer, and whether there is any nuance allowed. If they run the quiz from a script, and mark you wrong even if you deviate slightly, run. Big red flag that the company doesn't know what they are doing. I understand the need to filter out the bullshitters, but it should be easy to do this with a low false positive rate.
The company I work for gives a pretty basic take-home coding challenge before the technical zoom interview. We start the interview by doing a code review of the solution, which generally gives us a pretty good idea whether the candidate knows what they're doing or not and allows us to gauge strong/weak points. This isn't a difficult challenge and it's fairly easy to recognize what we're trying to see, e.g. full stack developer should show some SQL/data access, distinct application layers, DI, tests, and some kind of front-end JS. The second part consists of a bunch of questions similar to your post. Those kind of questions are important because we get a better sense of how well they know the language(s) they'll be working with every day. I think these are all completely valid for an entry-level position and I would have strong reservations making a hire recommendation if a mid to senior level developer couldn't at least articulate some kind of answer for those because - minus the debugging a stored proc one - I apply the answers to all of those questions in my day-to-day work. I feel like we need to ask those types of "trivia" questions to be sure that the coding challenge wasn't just copy/pasted and that, if hired, the candidate could jump in and not be entirely lost from day 1.
Poor question. You are testing a vocabulary term, not real-world knowledge.
It's designed to be a pre-filter before the meat of the interview begins.
There was a group?? This is something I would expect in a one on one phone interview.
Oh jeez. 😂
