A lot of it depends on your end goal and future plans. In my case, my day job is writing C# code for various libraries. I also write OSS projects using Mono and Gtk# among other things. It is also my primary language and I have an unhealthy addiction to ReSharper. So, if I was doing more Android coding, it would be an obvious choice to stick with Xamarin. I also happen to be loyal to Miguel de Icaza because of his work with Gnome, Gtk, and Mono. It has nothing technical, I just believe in C#'s promise of Write Once, Run Anywhere. I also find C# to be an elegant language, more so than Java. Now, if you don't know any language, I'd say look at your goals. If you are only going to write for Android, Java might be a good choice. If you want to write for Android and iPhone, I would consider sticking with Xamarin. Since you like Visual Studio, that would be a good reason to also stick with Xamarin.
I also know C, so so far I like C#. Thanks for the reply, I'm now waiting for them to respond to my student pack application.
You're using C# + PHP for web development or separate on different sites? I'm just confused that you seem to be using both more than "a lot".
&gt;The Indie edition is *$25/month, not expensive at all! Per platform per month 
That's great! Didn't know that :)
 do { Console.WriteLine( "Do you want to end the quiz here?" ); Console.Write( "Please answer Y/N: " ); var answer = Console.ReadKey(); Console.WriteLine(); if ( answer.Key == ConsoleKey.Y ) { Console.WriteLine( "You've reached the end of the quiz!" ); break; } } while ( true ); Console.WriteLine( "Here I will begin a new DO loop" ); Console.ReadKey(); 
Where are you stuck? What did you try? Did you actually try to debug it? Step by step through the code, evaluating each expression if the value is the way you expected it? Did you try a pen and paper test? Take a piece of paper, take your pen and do the algorithm on the paper, again evaluating each step checking whether your logic makes sense.
 Console.Writeline( ("test").PadRight(10) + "test" ); Console.Writeline( ("testing").PadRight(10) + "test" ); There's also a PadLeft function, if you're looking for aligning on the righthand side. **Edit**: The output is as follows: test test testing test ********** &lt;- 10 asterisks, to show how the padding occurs **Edit 2**: I noticed you're not using a monospace font in your screenshot. This code (and the general concept of padding with whitespaces) will only work if you're using a monospace font.. If you're doing WPF, you should be using WPF controls instead of trying to manually align things by manipulating string. It simply won't work.
I tried that, no go, thanks anyway though
What do you mean by 'no go'?
... Not homework in the slightest. I'm actually on my vacation from College until January; thank you. And if you can't see the screenshot then I don't know what to say.
The lengths were all varying, I'm having trouble coming up with a way to calculate the correct amount of padding required.
Using linq: myStrings.Max(x =&gt; x.Length)
The real problem with Xamarin, is that while you would have Visual Studio and C#, you will use Android API anyway - Activity class etc, and you will use native Android UI XML. Which is suck, because you will have less cross-platform capabilities, and WPF would be much more comfortable to work with. But, yeah, it's probably very hard task to implement WPF rendering engine for Android (if you are not Microsoft, or Google), and you would loose all those Android features with different layout for different resolutions, etc. Also, some early versions of Xamarin, had problem with delay at application startup, but they probably fixed it already. But as other people say here, it's probably only real option to use C# for Android. It's shame that companies that make mobile platforms, don't try to allow people use any language/technology that they want, instead of one 'native'. But this is also maybe not very easy task. 
Sometime it's not about difficulty of learning Java, sometimes it's about efficiency and comfort. While being similar to C#, lack of delegates and other small features in Java is annoying, and Visual Studio with C# is much better than Eclipse with Java. Developing apps both on Android/Java, Windows Phone 7-8/C#, i had much better experience with Windows Phone, and especially with WPF, then with Android. Sometimes I just feel sad, that people who develop languages platforms, don't want to look at their competitors, and try to learn something, and make their platform better. And Android Studio, I believe it is still in Beta
Most of my projects are done in C#, but do create a lot of projects/sites in PHP too. Also, I don't use both languages for the same website/app to answer your question. I hope this helps clear that up.
Which would I apply that to? The left or the right? 
Look at the example. I even updated the original comment with an example of what the output will look like. It's structurally similar to what you're trying to achieve in your screenshot. **Edit:** I noticed you're not using a monospace font in your screenshot. This code (and the general concept of padding with whitespaces) will only work if you're using a monospace font. If you're doing WPF, you should be using WPF controls instead of trying to manually align things by manipulating string. It simply won't work.
Get a designer to do it in an SVG or PNG file. Embed it into a resource and load it at runtime.
Honestly, Java isn't too dissimilar to C# if you know C# already, you basically just have to learn the Android libraries and structures. Eclipse has a great plugin for Android: http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html If you know C# pretty well, I don't think you'll struggle picking up Java and Android.
If you guys are up for it, then i can recommend learning Blend for building the GUI and only using VS for code
Thanks for the clarification!
Int is a variable datatype, a primitive "object". Classes, such as Vector2 are more like a template, you have to instantiate them as an object. This allows the object playerPosition to be different from another Vector2 enemyPosition (for example). Classes don't just store the two values, x and y, they also can contain methods that can be called on the object. This is why if you typed "playerPosition." (Note the period at the end of the object), your ide's intellisence should have many () selections and your x and y
Definitely learn XAML and the MVVM design pattern if you're not already familiar with it. It takes so much legwork out of UI logic.
I can't say I've heard of there being a book. Maybe they have pdfs you could download? 
Currently Reading the Xamarin.Forms book from Microsoft Press 
I'd go through their tutorials. I got Monotouch .NET book a while back and hardly touched it. I learned a lot more by digging through their sample code and following their tutorials. I've only worked on the iOS platform and it was helpful to have done some work in Xcode/ObjC before starting it. Honestly if I had to start doing some Android programming I'd probably rather learn Java and do it with their native tools. EDIT: If you're more set on a book, this is the Android equivalent of the book I got: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Android-Programming-Mono-NET/dp/1118026438/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=14ABKDQZDNV9GXDZYJKA Do note though that in the world of Xamarin, 6 months is a lifetime of changes, updates, new API's, new design patterns, etc... A 2 year old book may not be that useful.
As far as i get this: Xamarin is more or less the only Tool to write C# fpr Android. But using Java would be better and cheaper especially cheaper
.... and they're calling the solid C++ code "legacy"... =(
Pluralsight.com. One month costs about the same as a book, and I learn alot more from their videos, than I would reading a book. I see about 9 to 10 hours of beginner/intermediate level xamarin related content on there, right now, that would help you out.
As a WPF application, I can only assume you could (either via built-in .NET functionality, or more likely by accessing the underlying Win32 API); not sure whether or not you would need administrator privileges. I don't have any more specific information than that, and if I did, I'd be hesitant to provide it (especially without more information about your intended use of it) because: a) as a user, I personally can't conceive of a use-case scenario from which I would want a 3rd party application hijacking my computer b) as far as I know, this could very well be the next [Royal Canadian Mounted Police virus scam.](http://www.computersquad.ca/remove-Royal-Canadian-Mounted-Police-RCMP.htm)
I'd like to give this a shot as well, thanks.
I second this. I'm pretty sure it's not all that hard, but I really want to hear your use case before I actively help.
@Phybere has a point. Download the Xamarin samples from github and take a look. A lot is still changing, especially with Xamarin Forms. But I would recommend Xamarin Cross Platform Application Development by Jonathan Peppers, just because you wanted a book. You can also watch through the Xamarin Evolve Videos on Xamarin HQ channel on youtube. But your best bet at understanding Xamarin is by experimenting on their samples and creating your own app. Having a C# background, I think it will be easy for you. But by making your own app, you will realize the limits of the platform and learn more by asking around and researching the Xamarin Forums. A lot is still being developed (especially for Xamarin Forums) so don't be easily discouraged. I use Xamarin at work for making iOS and Android apps and it's not easy but I believe it's faster than say, making a native iOS app using Swift/Obj C then porting it to Java. Good luck! :)
Nothing nefarious and for personal use only. I simply want to create something similar to the program I mentioned (Big Stretch) but with my own personalized touches.
No specific advice though I do encourage you to engage with /r/learnprogramming instead of /r/csharp; they have a strong community and far better resources oriented towards what you desire/need.
ah, thanks. What I figured, but wanted to check if there would of been some magical method out there :D thanks again
 var parts = "foo-12032014-0004".Split('-').ToList(); parts[parts.Count - 1] = (Int32.Parse(parts.Last()) - 1).ToString("0000"); string result = String.Join("-", parts); 
Thanks for your message, maybe you are correct about this post, apologies for the inconvenience and I'll re-post it to /r/dotnet then :) 
hey you did someone's homework for them, good job!
Why don't you post your question here?
lol, homework? i'm working on a tool that parses out perfmon location paths. when you read the object, it is seeing what the next location path of the dcs file will be, that's why you need to subtract 1 to get the last written location...le sigh
I think the first thing to do is read through Raymond Chen's thought experiment which talks about this EXACT scenario. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/07/426294.aspx
&gt;Mentoring me over Skype would be really appreciated. Ain't nobody got time for that shit. Post your goal. Post what you've tried. Clearly explain what isn't working as expected.
I've tested this out in a console application and it seems to work well enough that I think you can pick it up from here. It uses a string builder and does some character arithmetic to decrement the final character, carrying if necessary. I haven't actually tested whether or not this performs faster than other methods, but I would expect it to mostly because strings in c# are immutable, meaning that any other method requires copying the bulk of the string to a new location in memory before it can continue working. char numStart = '0'; string decrement(string s) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s); int index = sb.Length - 1; bool carry; do { if (index &lt; 0) { throw new Exception("invalid number"); } carry = false; if (sb[index] == numStart) { carry = true; sb[index] = '9'; }else sb[index] = decrement(sb[index]); index--; } while (carry); return sb.ToString(); } char decrement(char c) { return (char)((int)c - 1); }
Do you want people to hate your software? Because that's how you get people to hate your software.
I've done this. First off, your window needs to automatically resize itself, not just maximize. to do that, use WMI to read the resolution of each screen (warning, more than one video card will cause problems), then set your applications window size to this, and center it. Now make you application TopMost (simple) Then, you need to hook the keyboard. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/toub/archive/2006/05/03/589423.aspx has an example. Using the hook, you want to capture and cancel certain key combinations, like ctrl shift esc, ctrl alt del, alt tab, etc etc etc. Basically, just keep testing it yourself trying to "escape" it until you can't. Also... lessons learned... leave yourself a hidden exit key (something stupid like ALT+SHIFT+,) In case anyone is wondering why I did this, it was to prank a coworker. I created a program just like this that was transparent, so he could still see his desktop and things moving, just couldn't click on / do anything. After a short time, ned from Jurassic Park popped up in bottom right corner going "ah ah ah!" Needless to say, he was not pleased :) Oh, and don't forget to make your window borderless Also, the original reason I began looking into this was I was working on creating a kiosk application for a hospital. The prank part came a little later when I realized how horrible I could be with it.... :P
You're right my bad! will redo this. Thank you!
You're right my bad! will redo this. Thank you!
Chat over FTP... wat Why not just set up an IRC server that requires SSL?
Lol uwotm8?
Just a fun idea
Well you don't really need any input then, do you? If you're doing it for fun, go nuts. It's sure not going to be what most people would call useful though.
Would be happy to review the course, and provide honest feedback. Just pm me the coupon.
I read that as "subtract red from potato" ...
You should create a new desktop, then switch desktops and load your window. That way none of the tools from the existing desktop will be available. You just have to make sure that you are hooking all the key combinations that would allow you to escape (Ctrl + Alt + Del, Ctrl + Shift + Esc, and possibly even disabling the StickyKeys dialog from popping if you wanted to be thorough). There are some examples posted here about hooking already. Switching desktops is the most reliable way IMO, and it is not that hard. For window sizing, get desktop size and set window height and width accordingly, that way it will work on different resolutions.
A listener is something that accepts incoming connections - something you'd use in a server. &gt; Yet I am not sure how to implement this into a gui That's a good point, and the simple answer is: **Don't.** At least not directly. Wrap it in a class library, create good usable components that wrap all this heavy lifting and handling stuff. Write unit tests for these components. Then you can use this class library in a GUI project and you have better separated parts.
It's not very secure when every client can decrypt everything. Same reason why snap chat is silly.
I'm not sure if I would use sockets if I were you ([TcpListener](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.tcplistener%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) is easier to use) But to answer your question: I would create a class to handle TcpListener. This class should initiate TcpListener and start listening for clients. Each time it receives a client, it would create instance of another class, which would handle single connection (TcpClient and its NetworkStream) - listening for incoming data and be able to send data to client. Once you have this simple design complete, you just extend these classes so that you can call some higher level function (for example void SendContactList(IEnumerable&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;) ) on them. For testing and fooling around, you can call these functions directly from UI, but in any semi-serious application, you should at least call them from other than UI thread and solve all the standard stuff related to thread synchronization.
I made an extremely simple chat program(basically what you are describing) a while ago. It isn't very good but it should get you started. I am not sure if it even works with more than two people/clients. Basically one of the "clients" is the host and therefore needs an open port and the other one connects to him. I believe it is TCPListeners that I have used. I can send you a link in a few hours if you are interested.
Sure, just register a hotkey for your application. Make sure it is not a global hotkey though, as it will probably cause the delete key to stop working.
Why not learn the difference and write in Java? aka. Are there benefits of programming with C# for this? 
Tcplistener and tcpclient are probably much easier. They are basically a wrapper for all that socket code. 
Considering that the last commit is **months** ago **and** they claim it only works in the **VS12** with **Roslyn Extension** (which is not supported anymore) or **VS14** version (which was back then an early CTP) it's safe to say: It just doesn't work anymore. Looking at the mess that the code is I'd say: It's better that way.
Well dang. I guess I'll have to figure out how to parse data from http://pokeapi.co instead. 
On your form set KeyPreview to true and wire up the KeyUp event handler. private void MainForm_KeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyData == Keys.Delete) this.Close(); }
See the other answers for how to do it, but... For a good user experience you might want to rethink your keybindings. Stick with what is common and known -- F5 = refresh, Esc = close dialog, etc.
One way to handle this is to place all of those controls into a container of some sort (panel, group box, etc) then you can just toggle the visibility of the entire container. 
well im actually doing it for school , and i have to do it this way so that i learn how to activate cancel button with other buttons 
That's a typical REST api.. **VERY** easy to access and parse.
Musixmatch have a pretty good API and they claim to have the largest database of songs, album art, info, etc. There was one more I tried a while ago but I cant remember the name. I will write back if I remember.
will patiently await your response vani_999 :)
The choices are rather limited in the poll.
I just want to say that I am terribly sorry for the quality of the code you are about to see. My excuse is that I was making it for a friend and he asked me not to use MVVM. That was the biggest challenge actually. :D But that also means that if you don't know MVVM it is going to be a challenge for you too - doing it with MVVM. :) The basic concept is still there though. http://www.mediafire.com/download/5corbvcvt29dqrq/TCPClient.7z
http://www.programmableweb.com/api/lyricwiki There it is. I also can't remember if it was that good but it sure did seem like it at the time. Good luck with your project.
I prefer dark. I find it puts me in a different headspace than when I'm using light or blue since white backgrounds tend to reflect when I'm looking at a word document or spreadsheet.
Yeah, I prefer the Solarized Dark that comes with the Theme Editor.
Am I one of the few that prefer the light?
Ah ok, my goal: I have a windows application that has several functions. I want to be able to call/start these functions from an iPhone. So first I looked at creating a TCP server inside the windows application, and a TCP client for the iPhone to send data to the windows application which would in turn activate/call certain functions. If this isn't the way to go, then should I perhaps create some sort of webservice, which the iPhone can consume?.. as data will be going from the iPhone, to the PC and vice-versa. I am not really sure? Azure? WCF? ASP.NET? REST? JSON? I don't know.. I am not sure which is the way to go for completing this project. 
Nope, I'm with you. I feel lost using dark. 
Default 
I don't mind light. It just feels so bright after getting used to dark. 
I have issues with eyestrain, and going with the dark theme solved a lot of it (well, that, and getting glasses.) Plus the dark theme looks pretty cool to the non-programmers that walk by, so there's that.
I'm sure most are already aware of this but if you like customizing your color scheme: https://studiostyl.es/
Since it's for school I presume they're making you use WinForms? If not, you may want to take a look at WPF. It's A LOT more powerful and versatile than WinForms. It has a bit of a learning curve, but definitely worth it.
Nope! I prefer light. Although it is light with a dark text editor(monokai), gives me that sweet sweet Sublime Text feeling.
I think parenthesis might make your point a bit more deliberate: lblCarHeader.Visible = (cbxLoanType.SelectedIndex == 0); lblHomeHeader.Visible = (cbxLoanType.SelectedIndex != 0); The code that is in parenthesis could be any expression that evaluates to true or false in this case. You can use the same concept to change other items in your label (or any other control) the same way. lblCarHeader.Text = (User.HasCar ? User.CarName : "Not Found"); Where User.HasCar is a property of type bool. The expression that I just wrote in the parenthesis is called [ternary](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ty67wk28.aspx). This should help you expand your horizons on how to make your user control code a bit more dynamic while keeping it clean.
I used to use dark until I started noticing how the lack of light was depressing me, especially in the winter. Now I use the Coding Horror light color scheme.
If I may ask, why no eBook? Is it a matter of legitimacy, that eBooks are by authors that aren't good enough to get their work published? Because the Yellow Book is a great piece of work for beginners, written by a university professor who distributes it for free. Skim through it and see what you think. http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/
You might want to check out Head First C# by O'Reilly. It was my first C# book and I felt like it explained the concepts pretty well. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027812.do
Another option is to take an instructor lead course, the Microsoft Technology Associate exam 'software development fundamentals c#' is a good one that covers all the basics.
I love this book and, he updates it every year.
I recommend this a lot.....but consider a month long subscription to Pluralsight. The problem with a book is that: 1) Not everyone learns from a book and 2) Not everyone (even those at the same level) will get the same thing from a book. Pluralsight has the advantage of giving you many, many, books worth of information -- for the price of one. You can bounce around topics as you see fit, and they cover both conceptual/abstract topics (programming in general) and very specific applications (like a C# course). 
I also love Pluralsight. Another site I usually reccomend is Safari, for the same reason... one subscription for tons of content (ebooks specially).
I like it, except for break; I prefer a loop control bool variable rather than a GOTO. While(true) generally makes me cringe. 8/10: would read again. EDIT: Things can simplify if if the "You've reached the end of the quiz" is AFTER the loop. do { Console.WriteLine( "Do you want to end the quiz here? (Y/N)" ); var answer = Console.ReadKey(); Console.WriteLine(); } while ( answer.Key != ConsoleKey.Y ); Console.WriteLine( "You've reached the end of the quiz!" );
I'm too used to Blue to switch away. 
I wrote this up for a friend. It might help. http://mays.co/so-you-wanna-be-a-software-developer/
thanks everybody :)
this.
My problem is floaters. Rapid eye movements makes them really distracting and annoying when I use a light theme. With a dark theme they are barely noticeable.
I hated this book. IMO it places too much emphasis on getting the reader to quickly build GUI interfaces (presumably to make the reader feel accomplished) without laying a good foundation first. There's a lot of "don't worry about what this code does right now, just type it in". 
there is a book called C# for students. It's a good starter book.
Can confirm. What really makes it good is the exercises. Do them all and you'll really learn the language. The english isn't perfect in places (the book is a collaborative effort with multiple authors) but you always understand. You'll become really confident as you progress from chapter to chapter.
My friend, you are looking for data binding. With this, you can bind the visibility of a WPF control to say a boolean property. Better yet, this would all be done within the XAML asides from a few things. You can even bind to properties of other elements within the same XAML file!
I use blue with either Son of Obsidian or Nightfall studiostyle, depending on my mood.
Nope, I'm with you :)
You can't mask ctrl + alt + del in user mode, I think. 
But setting = default(DateTime) does, and is what would happen if it were a field or if C# didn't have that particular requirement. 
I don't think that's such a bad approach, but it probably lends itself better to a structured environment (like a classroom) rather than self-study. When you're studying programming on your own, it's too easy to move on before you get to the "good foundation" while a class can force it on you once you've gotten a taste of a "finished product", even if you wrote barely any of it yourself.
When you are little more experienced, I'd highly recommend picking up Jon Skeet's C# Indepth http://csharpindepth.com/
After trying several books, i'm currently enjoying this one http://www.introprogramming.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Books/CSharpEn/Fundamentals-of-Computer-Programming-with-CSharp-Nakov-eBook-v2013.pdf . Easy to understand and has problems after every chapter.
I finished it a few days ago and I enjoyed every single page of it!
&gt;&gt; "You could pass a reference to the null object to DefaultIfEmpty. Then methods can act without knowing about empty collections." &gt; Is this a null object defined by me or just systems own null object? It is the **default** value. This means `default(T)`, which is null for reference types. There's also an overload where you can specify the to-be-used default value yourself. &gt;&gt; On out-of-range accesses, ElementAtOrDefault returns the default value for the type &gt; If my collection is my some personal defined type, what would it return? I get that if collection is int, the default will be 0, for string it will be nullstring, so what is it for all the other types. If I make an object class that is IEnumerable, and put a few of these objects in a collection. What would the ElementAtOrDefault return if the collection hadn't been populated yet? Here again, it's the **default** value. &gt;&gt; "Conceptually, ElementAtOrDefault can make a collection be infinite. It can make every possible index returning a valid value—the default value—if it is not actually present in memory." "....it eliminates the need for bounds-checking, but it could create extra complexity down the road if you need to add special casing for the default value." &gt; Why is this a problem? It's not really making the list bigger. The list isn't infinite. Also I dont get the second point, what kind of extra complexity. Can someone give an example for this? I think they mean if you have a while with an incrementing index it will never throw an exception when you use that method. Not too sure tho. &gt;&gt; The argument to First is a Predicate instance—it can be specified in the lambda syntax. &gt; This isn't true for FirstOrDefault as it simply returns the first value. But so does list.First() when used with no parameters. So why bother with FirstOrDefault? I'm guessing it has something to do with avoiding exceptions. But couldn't that have been added to First method itself, rather than making a new, kind of useless method? You're misunderstanding this. What they mean is that `.First(x =&gt; x.Name == "Bob")` (note that this is an overload that accepts a parameter) will return the first instance where this **predicate** is matches. `FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.Name == "Bob")` will return the first instance where this predicate matches, or the default value if none matches. &gt;&gt; While GroupBy can index elements by keys, a Dictionary can do this and has the performance advantages provided by hashing. &gt; What is Hashing? Hashing is a way to compute a checksum out of an value. The `object` class has a hashcode method, so has every other type automatically too. It's faster to compute a checksum and check for the existance of this checksum instead of iterating over all keys and comparing each all over again. There are plenty of articles about hashing. &gt;&gt; In many IEnumerable types, you cannot directly index a certain element. &gt; Does anyone have an example for this? It is further expanded as... With a list you can do `myList[5]` to directly access the index 5 (sixth element). You can't do this with an `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;`, as it has no indexer. &gt;&gt; If for some reason we only knew the type of the collection was IEnumerable, we could more realistically use ElementAt. &gt; If we don't know the index, then how can be call a certain index position? The sentence says nothing about not knowing the index. It says whether not knowing the actual type of the `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` (e.g. if it's a list, a collection or something else). When the underlying type is a type that supports indexed access (e.g. list) it will use this indexer. If it does not support indexed access this method will simply manually iterate over all elements until the Nth element (index) is found. &gt;&gt; " the Distinct method provides a declarative, function-oriented syntax for a typically imperative processing task." &gt; what's imperative processing? Line after line checking each value. Just try to write the stuff you can write with LINQ in a traditional way, then you see the difference. Again, plenty of Wikipedia articles on this. &gt;&gt; "The Except extension method provides a fast way to use set logic." &gt; What does it mean by set logic? Does it have to do with properties? In that case why is not get logic? We are getting a list that is except-ed of the undesirable elements. They're not talking about a setter of a property, but about the mathematical concept of a set: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) &gt;&gt; "The LastOrDefault method will never throw an exception on a non-null collection reference. It will return the default value." &gt; Is this a typo or am I just misunderstanding it? Isn't that kind of redundant. This is not redundant. When you call it on a collection that is not `null`, it will always return a value. Calling `Last()` will throw an exception. That's the big difference.
Also using a loop over array of Control -'s instead of 10 separate lines helps readability
This one is awesome: http://www.introprogramming.info/english-intro-csharp-book/ Also C# step by step by John Sharp (2013)
This a thousand times. Also the English in the book is not perfect because the book was written in Bulgarian originally.
I like this. I've enjoyed the nuget approach to smaller web apps (except having to upgrade the whole thing every time a single package has a security issue). I'm just trying to wrap my mind around converting a 80-project enterprise app to this kind of stack. Here's hoping they provide good tooling to assist with that! Moving forward, though, this is the way to go.
I recently had this issue, and ended up creating a 3rd class to join them. From what I did read previously it is not possible to have additional properties on a joining table without creating the 3rd class. Here is a StackOverflow answer that might be of use: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7053393 Here is a Google search that you can use to maybe find if there is another way: https://www.google.com/search?q=entity+framework+code+first+many+to+many+additional+fields
High, its not available as an attribute to set this up, however it is possible using the fluent interface. Here is a video that goes over the configuration. This series is fantastic. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6fx9-5VkyU Edit: Adding link! Edit 2: The actual link showing how to do it using the fluent interface 
Now, one thing I am thinking of is how this will revolutionize enterprise code/module sharing. I have several DLL's and packages I have to create custom installers for and then upload to a sharepoint directory where other teams can consume them. I now envision creating an enterprise nuget endpoint where I can upload these packages, and teams can consume from there, eliminating dependency issues and such. Now that could be revolutionary. I guess it's possible with today's technology, but it sounds like it will be the default soon enough. That could balance out the initial growing pains.
&gt; From what I did read previously it is not possible to have additional properties on a joining table without creating the 3rd class. Of course not. How would this even work? How would it be designed? The payload ("additional properties") needs to be somewhere.
&gt; But how would I approach if the relationship has an additional attribute like a Attended date attribute? &gt; Am I now forced to program the 3rd class to handle the relation? Yes, you are. Because when you have have an additional attribute you do not have a true many-to-many relationship anymore. You have two 1-to-many relationships.
We don't have a nuget server installed, but we put our packages on a fileshare that everyone has access to and nuget can use that as a repository. It's a very low barrier to entry for us and you can start slowly by moving just a couple packages at a time. If your installer does more than just throw some DLLs into the GAC, you may need to write a powershell script to replace the logic, but once you have an example nudspec/init.ps1 it's usually pretty simple to modify them for new projects.
It's about [halfway through](http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-12-34/2783.Pic3.png). Looks like the base class library, runtime, app models, etc. Looks like any presentation layer or implementation level entities are in other parts of the stack.
&gt; So why bother with FirstOrDefault? I'm guessing it has something to do with avoiding exceptions. But couldn't that have been added to First method itself, rather than making a new, kind of useless method? This is a bit of a simplification for Single()/First()/Last() vs SingleOrDefault()/FirstOrDefault()/LastOrDefault(), but one way to view it is First() is for when you know you'll have a match, and FirstOrDefault() is for when you're not sure. It comes down to a semantic difference over what you're asking for. One thing to remember is exceptions are for exceptional events. First() means, give me the first element, and if you don't have one, that's a problem. FirstOrDefault() means give me the first element, but it's ok if there's not one. For example: Let's say I want to find the most recent order for a product class Product { public int ProductId {get; set;} public IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt; Orders {get; set;} } class Order { public int OrderId {get; set;} public DateTime OrderDate {get; set;} } var lastOrder = product.Orders.OrderByDescending(order =&gt; order.OrderDate).First(); If there are no orders for this product, First() will throw an exception. This doesn't make sense though, because a product might not have an order yet. So here you'd want to use FirstOrDefault(), and if there's no lastOrder, return "This product has not yet been ordered", instead of say, the order date. Alternatively, here's an example where you might actually want the exception: class Employee { public int EmployeeId{get; set;} public IEnumerable&lt;EmployeeEvent&gt; EmployeeEvents {get; set;} } // to keep track of things like hired, transferred, fired, etc. class EmployeeEvent { public int EmployeeEventId {get; set;} public DateTime EventDate {get; set;} public Status Status {get; set;} // EventType.Hired, for example } var mostRecentStatus = employee.EmployeeEvents.OrderByDescending(evt =&gt; evt.EventDate).First(); Here, it doesn't make sense to have an employee that has no events. They can't be an employee without having been hired. So if there isn't a first element to return, that's an error and it should throw an exception. &gt; What does it mean by set logic? Except() gives you all the elements in one collection, _except_ the elements that are also in the other collection. int[] original = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; int[] itemsToRemove = new int[] { 2 }; original.Except(itemsToRemove); // returns { 1 and 3 }, Just read it out like English: 1, 2 and 3... except 2... 
Holy crap. That situation sounds horrible. Why aren't you using artifactory? You get built-in nuget feeds that you can expose. 
You don't need a private nuget server. Just use artifactory. 
I'd rather have a 3rd class. It is cleaner that way IMO.
Are people really going to choose to run ASP.NET 5 (ASP.NET MVC 6) applications on Linux servers using a non-IIS web server? What does Microsoft have to gain from losing out on Windows Server and Windows SQL Server licenses or Azure revenue? Will Linux and Apache/nginx really ever get the support, documentation and first-class development that Windows and IIS will receive? Or will it be the "use at your own risk" experience with poor documentation that running ASP.NET MVC 4 is on Mono?
&gt;Are people really going to choose to run ASP.NET 5 (ASP.NET MVC 6) applications on Linux servers using a non-IIS web server? I think for more cloud oriented deployments, I would seriously consider it. It also opens up a lot of hosting options as well. It's certainly not for everyone, but I do think it has its merits. &gt;Will Linux and Apache/nginx really ever get the support, documentation and first-class development that Windows and IIS will receive? Or will it be the "use at your own risk" experience with poor documentation that running ASP.NET MVC 4 is on Mono? Deploying on Linux is always going to take more effort than deploying on windows, but it's a question of whether it makes sense for your application. I think you've got to have some knowledge, or at least some desire to gain the knowledge, of a Linux environment on staff in order for it be feasible. 
Though this is correct, I don't feel you should be calling this.Close() you should instead be calling your CancelButton_Clicked() function, this way you ensure any code that is normally called on cancel is called when the "CancelButton" is clicked, as this is what happens when you hit Escape by default.
In 2007 we pulled the plug early on developing our own in house CMS. We had at the time: 1. 1 15 project 300kloc web application which had been initially developed in VB.NET 1.0, upgraded to 1.1, converted to C# and upgraded to 2.0 2. 1 6 project 100kloc web application which served as a proxy to a gigantic powerbuilder codebase (hard to estimate size). 3. 1 14 project designed to enable rapid conversion of the powerbuilder code to C# several dozen other dll projects containing things like an out of process email service, a batch task processor, a SSO platform for internal use, etc We were EOLing the end user portion of the first solution (mature product designed for the static web of 2001-2003) listed to provide the market a CMS platform integrated with the 2nd/3rd solution (a similar project was a year in for the 2 -&gt; 3 case). And then we started to see the recession coming. This left us in the position where we had to make a few license sales on the CMS platform (which was 8-10 months out from being really production ready) and all we had at the time was a pretty dashboard interface that only worked when you clicked on the correct images (read we had NOTHING; we called the product demos internally "Happy Path" demos because if you didn't follow the script everything went sad...). And then one of our sales guys sold it. He sold it big. One client bought the whole license for enough that the company survived the recession on that single sale (there were still layoffs and unpleasentries, project 2-&gt;3 didn't make it, but we survived in a market we shouldn't have). Unfortunately we only had 5 months before they were either going live or leaving. So we had a meeting where we (the developers) laid out the fact that we wouldn't have our in house CMS and decided that the 2007 .NET CMS market didn't really have much to offer but DNN was there and appeared to be decent at least. We did not get any allowances to let any "business specific" code back into the OSS community so we couldn't really just take DNN and make the changes we needed at the time because they would all need to be made open if we ever allowed a client to self host. Instead for everything we could, we made separate dlls and projects that could be installed on top of a DNN instance. From DNN's perspective, outside of our membership provider and a couple other structural classes, none of our code depends on anything in DNN. So we are still here. We tried to play nice with the DNN community, filing bugs, providing patch files, etc. That didn't work out so well and now we need special approval for every OSS system we want to work with and the company doesn't allow us to actively contribute back (thank you dnn; I am certain we aren't the only company that has bad tastes from dealing with them and is left with corporate saying fuck no to allowing any dev effort to OSS). Still because of the licensing BS, we have a now heavily modified fork of VB DNN (partially converted now to C#). It is made available in an open license strictly in the terms necessary (MIT...). We didn't have to enforce such a strict separation of our code from DNN code, but since we did (it makes it easier for us to take DNN security fixes and what enhancements we desire and port over), we currently have 160 module projects and other packages we install to our 90 client sites alongside our own fork. I strongly suggest nobody develop a platform on top of DNN. While it has gotten better, plenty of alternatives have come up since 07 with healthier communities and a stronger effort to continue to get better.
&gt; Are people really going to choose to run ASP.NET 5 (ASP.NET MVC 6) applications on Linux servers using a non-IIS web server? As thing stand right now I would like to, because it's quick, automatable and doesn't cost $$$ to create some linux VMS, configure them and get them serving web traffic. And to throw away the VMs that you did that with last week. You really want this if you have a lot of load and frequent deploys.
It's an exciting time to be a .NET developer. 
Use a StringBuilder class to combine your strings. It is very efficient. Use StringBuilder.AppendLine() which will use the correct line terminator so that you can get your text on different lines. Also, do this: if (line.Contains("12345")) and while (!(lines[i].Contains("edit")) Contains() returns a bool, so you don't need to explicitly check the return value against True or False. The *If* and *While* statements do that check for you.
That's pretty cool, thanks for sharing. Usually though if it's a pretty simple API I prefer RestSharp
Windows forms supports this kind of binding out of the box. Create a view model and hand it to a binding source. Bind a panel's visibility to a boolean property on the view model. MVPVM can be extremely effective.
Even more maintainable: var isCarType = cbxLoanType.SelectedIndex == 0; lblCarHeader.Visible = isCarType; lblHomeHeader.Visible = !isCarType; Though I'd definitely put each set of controls in its own panel and overlap the panels and toggle only the panels' visibility. Much easier to manage in the designer too.
You should consider some of the free tutorials available online. I really like the tutorials offered by [this site](http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/Tutorials.aspx). Start with the section on C# Fundamentals, then move on to the C# OOP section, and then the section on LINQ to Objects. One book that I do recommend (but not for beginners) is [C# in Depth](http://www.amazon.com/Depth-3rd-Edition-Jon-Skeet/dp/161729134X). Consider checking that one out after you've gone through a few introductory-level books or tutorials.
Because you won't need new error codes at run-time I would recommend a shared project that has the file as a localized resource. It's very straightforward to add in visual studio (Resource File), then change the visibility from internal to public.
Yes I think a class library with a resource file would do nicely here.
Thanks. I'll look into it. I was looking at using a database table. It sounds like this is similar to a .properties file.
If you don't have to worry about globalization, it's fine to just hardcode a static dictionary in a class in a shared project. You don't want to do overkill. You can adjust this according to what you want to use as the key, here I'm using int'ss as the key, and strings as the value. public class ErrorCodes { public static readonly Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; _codesLookup = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; { { -200, "WARN_TRANS" } , { -201, "FAIL_TRANS" } }; } }
Could you please be any less precise?
This was my first blog post ever, so I'll be the first to admit it's not perfect. Thank you for the feedback.
Book or not, if you want to learn how to code you will only learn by trying. You can read 600 books on programming, but until you start practicing it will be useless.
Two of my professors called it Visual Studios. It drove me nuts. It's not plural. **Visual Studio**
Before I went to college to take a programming course this same question plagued me. Now that I have taken it in school it seems so easy, but it was hard to wrap my head around it. Like others have said, you use it to instantiate a new class. It sounds like you're just learning programming (sorry if I am wrong here) and you should read up on Object-Oriented principles. Knowing when to make something a class, and how to use the classes will really set off lightbulbs and "a-ha" moments. At least it did for me.
What about using the WebBrowser control? The WebBrowser.DocumentText property contains the rendered html after scripts have run. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.webbrowser.documenttext%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

Is the iframe on a different domain name? You will probably run into unauthorized cross site access problems, but you can get around them http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6778212/read-iframe-content-using-webbrowser-c-sharp
The wall of text from it seems like a bit much. I wasn't sure of the best way to go about it.
In a perfect world, you would already be using source control, and you could throw your assignment up on Github/Bitbucket/Codeplex/whatever. In the real world... https://gist.github.com/
Didn't know about these things, sorry. I figured emailing a zipped folder of the project to someone would have been easiest way. Wasn't sure what I should post on there, so I posted everything.
The first issue I am having is a NullReferenceException when you prompt the user for the name of their Health Insurance Company. This was the one thing my professor gave any feedback on and his idea did nothing to solve the problem.
iframes are a little tricky. If the iframe elements have a name property, you can use the solution listed here, to get the content: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20013498/webbrowser-iframe-access-causing-unauthorized-access 
so set a breakpoint a few lines above where the error happens (or preferably MANY lines above ) and step through it and watch each variable being set. you should reach a point where you see one of your objects is still set to NULL where you intended it to have a value work out where it SHOULD have been populated, why it didn't happen (may require setting another breakpoint and re-testing) , and fix it.
Here are a couple things I see that would result in points off if I were grading your assignment. I apologize if this list seems harsh, but I believe that honest and frank feedback is the best way to help you improve. ###Object Initialization As /u/sid_hottnutz already mentioned, you are getting a `NullReferenceException` because you didn't initialize `theBenefits` in your `Employee` class. In fact, it looks to me like you might have been given stubs for three constructors, and you forgot to implement two of them. After fixing this bug, it appears that your program works fine, although the formatting of the output could be a bit nicer. ###Default Values This line probably isn't doing what you think it is: protected string firstName, lastName = "NOT GIVEN"; This only initializes `lastName`, to initialize both `firstName` and `lastName`, you need to assign to each of them explicitly: protected string firstName = DEFAULT_NAME, lastName = DEFAULT_NAME; ###Named constants You should use your named constants rather than copying and pasting the literal string around. As in the corrected example above, use `DEFAULT_NAME` instead of copying the string `"NOT GIVEN"` everywhere. ###Inconsistent Naming Several of your method names do not follow [naming guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms229002%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) commonly used in C#. For example, `getStringInputValue` should be `GetStringInputValue`, `hourlyEmployee` should be `HourlyEmployee`, `AnSalary` should be `AnualSalary`, etc. ###Poorly named methods I have no idea what the difference between `calculateWeeklyPay` and `calculateWeeklyPay2` is supposed to be. ###Dead/useless code You override the `calculateWeeklyPay` method in your `hourlyEmployee` class, but the only thing it does is call the base class implementation. Your `Employee` class contains a field `wkPay`, which is never used except when you assign to it in the third constructor and in `ToString`. Yet you never actually read the value of `wkPay`, even in the `ToString` method. ###Truncating values If you were explicitly told to do this by the assignment, then ignore this one. But, generally speaking you should throw an error, and make the user correct an invalid input, rather than truncating it to some min/max value. ###String Formatting Your string formatting code is hard to read and prone to bugs. Use `String.Format` instead of raw string concatenation. ###Summary The object initialization error is the only real killer here, but the other things I listed are significant in showing that you don't understand the language as well as you could. The fact is that you turned in an assignment that didn't actually work. If I were grading this, I would give you the minimum passing grade based on the above. If the code worked, I then I would say your code would rate about a low to mid-range B.
Thank you for the feedback. It is much appreciated.
Pro C# and the .NET 4.5 framework.
I rewrote the program and now I have errors on the Salary and Hourly classes: Error Inconsistent accessibility: base class 'Employee.Employee' is less accessible than class 'Employee.Hourly' The classes are all set to public; could anyone tell me what it is I am missing? edit: link to the new code: https://gist.github.com/Wdlast/4bf199e1220d16773afa
Compile it and see if it runs and does what you want it to do and if it doesn't you did it wrong.
The link in the comment you replied to shows the code for the classes. All three of the classes in question: Employee, Hourly, Salaried, are all declared as public classes.
Are you unsure of your answers? Maybe you can ask about a specific question or write the authors?
yea i am not completely confident in my answers. it's weird to me that some sections have answers but the sections titled "review" don't have any.
Hmm... Well I gave your code a quick once-over and nothing really stuck out to me. You could try removing the access modifiers (public) from the class declarations. Another thing you could try is changing the namespace from "Employee". Maybe try using the title of the lab? Something else you could try is doing a clean and then a rebuild. Other than that, I'm stumped. :(
What the hell... Hit clean and the errors disappear and my code works. Never heard of that function before. No clue why the hell my code works now when it looks the exact same as it did. I was looking up fixes for that crap for like two damn hours and everything pointed toward something being private that should be public. At any rate, thanks so much!!
write the authors and ask them if there is an answer key? Or post the questions you are unsure of and ask this subreddit. If you update your post I may take a look

_A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_. It's brutal and accessible. Touches on themes ranging from religious guilt (particularly sexual guilt in adolescence), the development of artistic awareness, and love. If you aren't familiar with Irish culture, some references and phrases will be opaque, but it's nothing a quick google or wiki won't fix. If you'd prefer something contemporary, _An Artist of the Floating World_ (Kazuo Ishuguro) is one of the more moving books I've read.
You should pass the Dispatcher from the main thread to those classes. When tasks in those classes are done, use the dispatcher to invoke the method/s you need to execute on the main thread.
I hate BackgroundWorker, but it does give you easy access to the UI thread via the "ReportProgress" function. In a situation where I have multiple threads that all need to access the UI I would create a special thread just for checking for pending updates and invoking them on the UI thread. Look up information on how to use "Invoke" which will allow you to force the UI thread to run an update routine. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zyzhdc6b%28v=vs.110%29.aspx For example, if you have a textbox you want to update, you can pass the text to a volatile string variable, the update thread checks every few milliseconds if the volatile string variable has been changed and if it has, it invokes the UI thread to swap out the textbox's text. Lambda expressions are useful for threads because it allows you to pass something to the thread. For example: public class Form1 : Form { public delegate MyInvokeDel(); public MyInvokeDel InvokeDel; public volatile string MyString = ""; public Form1() { InvokeDel = new MyInvokeDel(RunOnMainThread); Thread t = new Thread( () =&gt; ThreadRoutine(this) ); t.Start(); } public void ThreadRoutine(Form MainForm) { //dostuff MyString = "BOB!"; MainForm.Invoke(MainForm.InvokeDel); Thread.Sleep(1000); MyString = "Chicken!"; MainForm.Invoke(MainForm.InvokeDel); } public void RunOnMainThread() { //Do stuff on Main Thread - change the textbox text to the new string. TextBox1.text = MyString; } } 
That's sweet! I hate having to have two declarations (variable and property) for a property.
Ok first things first. When you update a UI using data that originates from another thread you will cause an access violation. The reason for this is because your main thread (UI) cannot read directly from your update thread. Cross thread exceptions occur when you do this. Also for your solution, consider raising events in your classes that your UI listens to. So when your thread is done processing, have it raise an event. Your UI will listen to the event and then start processing your UI updates with any data that's been provided by the event. You'll need to get around the cross thread exception though as any data raised in the event still belongs to the thread that created it. To do this, use the InvokeRequired property. Like so: private void AnimalUpdate(object sender, MyApp.Zoo.AnimalUpdateEventArgs e) { if (InvokeRequired) { MyApp.Zoo.Park.AnimalUpdateHandler aue = new MyApp.Zoo.Park.AnimalUpdateHandler(AnimalUpdate); Invoke(aue, new object[] { sender, e }); return; } else { DisplayAnimals(); } } This was some code I found when I demonstrating Invoke a while ago.
*C# in Depth* takes you through new language features from C# 2 onwards and explains what they are and how they fit into the scheme of things. *C# in a Nutshell* is a survey of the language and framework that also goes in depth. It's quite a large nutshell but you can skim it the first time through just to get an idea of what functionality is available. Then when, say, you need to do some asynchronous programming, you can remember that the book had a section on that and refer to it. *Inside the Microsoft Build Engine: Using MSBuild and Team Foundation Build* will teach you how to extend the build process beyond adding postbuild commands in VS. You'll be able to understand what's going on in a .csproj file instead of just seeing a mess of XML.
Expression-body methods and string interpolation are my faves. I use these all the time in Scala.
It really is amazing what they have been doing with .NET in the past 2 years or so.
It'll be really nice to use all these features when my workplace moves to vs 2015 in something like ten years.. 
First, a few things... If you're not using at least [Visual Studio Community Edition](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs), get it now - it's free*. (tell your professor and class mates) Ask your professor to apply for a (free) class room license for [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/choose_edition.jsp?license=CLASSROOM). Hands down the best addon for Visual Studio. Resharper highlights common code issues, suggests alternatives and help enforce good practice overall. Resharper also has an integrated NUnit runner*. If you're planning to make a career out of C#, I highly recommend that you get yourself a [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/signup) subscription. It's an invaluable resource for quickly getting up to scratch on technologies and learning new things. I'm not going to repeat what @0xffff2 said, but instead I'll focus on more semantic issues and best practices. 1. Constructors *should* construct an object in a valid state. 2. Constructors should preferably not contain business logic or modify static variables (e.g. numEmployees). 3. Property setters should not default values unless it's logical to do so. Constraints should be enforced by throwing exceptions. (e.g. set AnSalary) 4. Express domain/business logic inside methods, not in properties. 5. Use enumerations and not value types (e.g. int, string) to represent well known states/values, especially if the value is provided via user input (e.g. DEFAULT_GENDER = 'U', ManLevel). 7. Keep your code simple and concise. The less magic the better. (e.g. Console.WriteLine inside salaryEmployee) 8. Comment your code to explain your reasoning, especially relating to domain/business logic. Always do this, even if you're the only one working on a project. Best of luck. 
[Resharper Ultimate: https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/)
When your code is built, the compiler generates "helper" files in the obj directory and the executables are output in the bin directory. I'm speculating here, but I think Visual Studio will sometimes not detect the changes you made in source code or will use the old files in the obj directory to build the executable. I've ran into problems like that before and typically use "rebuild" rather than "build" when I work. This is a similar question posed on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3095901/difference-between-build-solution-rebuild-solution-and-clean-solution-in-visua
ReSharper 9 for VS2015 is still extremely buggy.
You mean VS14 or VS2015.
Yeah that's what I meant.
&gt; StringBuilder.AppendLine works great! Thanks! 
Also thanks for the ! - made my code cleaner. 
For [the same reasons](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180860/public-fields-versus-automatic-properties) that autoprops are recommended over public fields.
[You can get around that.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9860595/prevent-changing-the-value-of-string-empty)
You can also change the value of the underlying readonly field of a readonly property.
It may be a software to expose something in a public place where you don't want anybody to access anything but your app. Like surveys for a show etc.
Run away.
But I have work life balance, and comprehensive benefits, plus you can't beat the pension. 
I was recently at a tech talk about asp.net and what they did there is pretty mindblowing. Crossplatform/not dependent on IIS, commandline tools for all the stuff so there's no dependency on VS, simple project files, custom runtime, built in dependency injection/IoC, new webstack redone from the ground up and so on.
I think using objects-as-values is a powerful programming technique; and it's one that's often cumbersome in C#. Unfortunately structs are often very slow; and struct semantics can be tricky when mixed with mutability (and immutable structs are verbose to implement, and require large constructors, which are hard to read in calling code). ValueUtils aims to make using plain-old-C#-classes fast enough for most use-cases; in some cases its faster than typical hand-rolled code due to better hash-mixing and tricks like avoiding the boxing conversion inherent in Enum.GetHashCode(). In any case - I hope other people find this useful too!
I wonder what all this short hand notation does to the actual processing speed. I wonder if it's faster, slower or same.
Ok, so .Net 4.0 rules out the async/await approach, but no problem. What are you using for your UI, WPF or WinForms? The example I linked to above is for WPF. The Data property on the Window is bound to a ListBox in the UI. Items are added intermittently from the BackgroundWorker in the ProgressChanged event handler. When these items are added, they're automatically displayed in the UI through the magic of WPFs data binding system. As long as the BackgroundWorker is created on the UI thread, the ProgressChanged event handler will be called on the UI thread. If you download the sample and put breakpoints on lines 130, 158 and 161 you'll notice the following: - On line 158 the SuperSlowWebService.FetchResults is called on a background thread. - On line 161, the ReportProgress method of the background worker is called, again this happens on the background thread. - On line 130, the event handler for ReportProgress is invoked. This is now happening on the UI thread. Enable the 'Threads' window in the VS debugger to see what thread is active when a breakpoint is hit. Unfortunately multi-threading is hard and requires a good understanding of a few different concepts which is why most of the material you're finding glosses over some of the things you're missing. Here's a WPF centric article that covers most of the bases: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163328.aspx
&gt; Whether that's true for private property getters or setters as well, I'm unsure. It has to be the same, the CLR is changing and it needs to store the data somewhere. 
Same. The CLR isn't changing so this has to spit out the same code you would have written by hand.
 public interface IDateTimeZone { string Id { get; } }
Also, I have some experience programming but not a ton. I work in IT and have a physics degree, but I want to learn programming and improve my career.
It probably depends on whether or not you're expected to perform by contemporary professional programming standards or only need to program for your standards. For example, I'll learn stuff from older materials which I later find to have been deprecated in newer versions of .NET. As a result, I'll be utilizing archaic and possibly overly complex methods to do things which have been simplified in newer versions. At the end of the day - you still have the MSDN reference site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff361664%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) which you should be able to use to navigate improvements to .NET after you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language.
Has a lot changed in 10 years? I have a lot to learn in regards to C# so it'll be a while before I'd program C# professionally. I also have a pluralight subscription, but I also like to learn from books sometimes.
I have no idea - I'm not a professional programmer so I don't care about the age of the book - just about getting done what I want the program to do. However, there are definitely a few instances I've run across of deprecated material while using older books.
Knowing the name of the book could help, but since you said you have a pluralsight account, you should check out the c# courses. *C# from scratch* is probably a good start, cos those "from scratch" type of courses are usually aimed at beginners. Plus the tools used in the vids are probably close to latest, so you will also learn the way around the IDE.
Pluralsight is great. I'd recommend starting on the 'from scratch' videos for C#, then move on to Scott Allen's courses. As far as change from 2005 to now, probably a lot. I don't have a list of changes but anecdotally I run into forums posts weekly where the proposed .net code is footnoted with 'hey you should use xxxx now since this old way sucked due to zzzz'. Honestly it is old enough to where I would not put faith in the text without double checking msdn to make sure it is still applicable.
I just updated to 2015 and also updated Resharper to 9 on Sunday, and it's been working good for me. (Resharper 9.0.0.0 on VS 14.0.22310.1)
I don't know myself either. But if you are looking at the web side of things, MVC is a big change that a lot of people seem to be getting on board with. As for learning though, I honestly think you are okay. You can learn the newer stuff after the fact easily enough.
If you have not programmed with c# before this should be fine - but don't get attached to winforms development and plan to research a few topics afterward to update the foundation provided by this book
If you are serious about improving your career then change your mentality about investing on it immediately. Buy a new book.
C# 3 was released in 2007. It introduced LINQ (absolutely huge feature you do not want to miss out on), auto-properties, object initializers, extension methods, and more. It's a huge difference. And if you're doing any asynchronous programming, C# 5 introduced async and await which drastically simplify things. There are more features too that have been added in the meantime, but these were the ones I know I use every day. Strictly speaking you don't need any of these, but C# is a much richer and powerful language because of them. EDIT: Oh and reading your other comment: two years ago I was a physics grad student who knew some basic python and C++. I've been doing software development since then, and I would totally recommend learning the new stuff, especially if you're looking to make yourself more marketable. I've actually had a whole lot of success trawling through C# blogs and StackOverflow to learn new language features, so books aren't the only way to learn.
Another option you could consider testing for serialization might be just binary serialization: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/72hyey7b%28v=vs.110%29.aspx I'm unsure if it would capture event handler subscriptions, but it might be worth a shot. Edit: This is a tutorial: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4abbf6k0%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
Local library? Ours rocks. I put in requests all the time on new titles. They also provide access to ebooks as well. 
This book would target .NET 2.0-- avoid it. Far too much has changed, including the actual .NET runtime. It's ancient in .NET terms. 
JSON.NET can do binary serialization. Its not the output that is the key problem. The key problem I see here is that the object GUID between session 1 and session 2 will be different. How will the serialization framework know which new object to reconnect the event to? What if the object it needs to connect to has not yet been deserialized and yet doesn't exist?
Definitely buy a new one. It depends on what you are doing, but you're probably missing out on a few important concepts. Examples: LINQ, generics, async/await, MVC, WPF, WEB API etc
Depends on the specifics, but generally? Yes. A lot has changed in 10 years. The fundamentals are still mostly the same (conditional statements, loops, arrays, objects, classes, methods...) but the *way* in which its preferred to write stuff today is a lot different than 10 years ago (especially for the web, where I mostly work).
I just tried binary serialization. It looks like it would work. [This](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a14aec1f3e6c06363d55) is my code. The first output of the program is: Top-level object saved. The second time the program is run, the output is: Top-level object loaded: Handler for bar1 called. ___ I'm not sure how Json.Net would handle that kind of a situation. Did you try it?
Thanks for having a crack, however I think you'll find it all falls apart if you've got a bunch of objects subscribed to each other in various ways. What happens in the case where Obj1 and Obj2 reference Obj3? Is Obj3 created twice or is some magic happening and C# knows that it has already deserialized Obj3 once?
I'm just speculating, but I think it depends on your top-level object capturing the references of everything. If the serialization thing (either with JSON or with binary) falls flat, you'd probably have to find some sort of way to maintain a list of objects created and use the [observer design pattern](http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer) for event handling. That could get hairy really quick.
I have [another program](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/362cced6a9748e6d0a80) that demonstrates it would work out in the end. :) Since I'm maintaining a list of FooBars, those are the only ones that would get serialized to the file. Things might break if I forget to add a FooBar to the list of FooBars. ___ For completeness, this is the output of the program when "3" and "5" were entered previously: Top-level object loaded: Obj0's trigger was called. Obj0 called Obj1 Obj1's trigger was called. Obj1 called Obj0 Obj1 called Obj2 Obj2's trigger was called. Obj2 called Obj2 Obj2 called Obj0 Repeatedly running the program will produce the same result until file.dat is deleted from the disk.
If money is an issue, Microsoft released a large collection of EBooks for free this year. I suspect there will be newer material here to reference, even if it's not specific to C#: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mssmallbiz/archive/2014/07/07/largest-collection-of-free-microsoft-ebooks-ever-including-windows-8-1-windows-8-windows-7-office-2013-office-365-office-2010-sharepoint-2013-dynamics-crm-powershell-exchange-server-lync-2013-system-center-azure-cloud-sql.aspx
I want to do web dev. What do you suggest for that?
I want to do web dev. What do you suggest for that?
Only one recently that was a book on asynchronous programming by Stephen Cleary - I had just seen some in house videos at my company to get trained up at first. Pluralsight is probably equivalent in terms of depth - they have done pretty good stuff there. 
It doesn't have to be that way. You can call the base class constructor at any point and the CLR won't balk.
Why C# specifically? If you want to learn programming in general, the book you have will be fine. But there are certainly better languages to start off with if you are a newbie to programming and want to learn the basics.
I actually got pluralsight yesterday. Thanks for the advice!
I'd suggest you read this article on MSDN: [How to: Create Graphics Objects for Drawing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y289054.aspx). For something more practical, read this article on Code Project: [Round Button in C#](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5082/Round-Button-in-C). When I just started out with C# I enjoyed reading articles on [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/). There's a lot of variety, although the quality of the articles differ a lot, the topics can be quite interesting. e.g. [Motion Detection Algorithms](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10248/Motion-Detection-Algorithms)
What type of web stuff? Front end (the graphics/visual interactive) or backend ( the database/data retrieval/formulaic)?
It's perfectly fine for learning the basics. Nothing has changed since .NET 2.0. Yes we've added a lot to the language, but there is nothing that you need to unlearn. That said, why not buy a used book from Amazon?
There is a bay, which has pirates.
Awesome! I think PluralSight is one of the greatest dev resources out there, especially when watching very talented devs write some cool little demo programs with the latest tech while explaining everything they do along the way.
Yeah. I should probably just do that.
Not having the constructor call of MyBase.New(...) as the first line in a derived classes constructor is a compiler error (it can be missing completely, and will be implicitly added, but you cannot have it as say the last line in the constructor to change when the base constructor is called). I ran a rather contrived, overly simple test with both; a base class and a derived class with instance and static field initializers (as well as method bodies, to see when the actual method body ran). I tracked execution by simply breakpointing every line of code. For Visual Basic.NET, the order of execution was as follows- I use Static rather than Shared to prevent confusion here. Derived Static Fields,Base Static Fields,Base Instance Fields,Base Constructor Code,Derived Instance Fields, Derived Constructor Code. With C#, the result was Derived Static Fields, Derived Instance Fields, Base Static Fields, Base Instance Fields, Base Constructor Code, Derived Constructor Code. I don't know of any way these orders can be changed through language constructs, personally, though I'm far less familiar with VB.NET 
&gt; Not having the constructor call of MyBase.New(...) as the first line in a derived classes constructor is a compiler error So? That's the compiler's decision. The CLR isn't so picky. &gt; I don't know of any way these orders can be changed through language constructs, personally, though I'm far less familiar with VB.NET Open up the code in ILDASM. Especially when the code has examples like this: ReadOnly MyList As New List(Of Int) ReadOnly MyListWrapper As New ReadOnlyCollection(Of Int)(MyList) You'll see the rewriting that VB does to move the initialization into the constructors. 
Or ebooks of IT, ...info Useful info
&gt; So? That's the compiler's decision. The CLR isn't so picky. Yes. I know. But I now understand what you are saying, which is that it was possible that C# could work the way VB.NET does. And of course that is true. I suppose I disagree that it is a "Stupid Limitation" of C#, but merely a different trade off; the way C# does it prevents you from calling instance members when writing initializers, which VB.NET allows, but in doing so it also guarantees that an initialized field of a reference type is guaranteed to be initialized in any user code. In particular, for example, a virtual method call made in the constructor, which is something VB.NET does not.
Pluralsight is probably better than any book. While I learned C++ and Python in school, I'm "self taught" in C# for my job and I learned more about C# from blogs than I probably would ever have learned from a book (once you have the basics of programming down). I've [uploaded an export](https://gist.github.com/nemec/a4682fbc4c0a1030f3ec) of my .Net RSS category, but some of the ones I recommend the most: * http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ * http://blog.stephencleary.com * http://blog.howarddierking.com * http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk * http://haacked.com * http://lostechies.com * http://ericlippert.com
For web stuff you absolutely positively need to get a current book. Web dev is moving so fast it's ridiculous.
There's nothing wrong with starting with this book, it will be good to know a little of C#'s history. You will need to get that up-to-date book at some point though. Having lived a little of C# 2.0 you will better appreciate and understand the syntactic sugar and new features that have come since in the newer frameworks.
If you're using GDI+, you can't draw a single pixel directly. This is because GDI+ is supposed to be resolution independent, so a nominal pixel may not render as a single pixel at all resolutions. Instead, you have to create a 1x1 bitmap, set its color, and then draw the 1x1 bitmap at the desired location. See "Draw a single pixel dot": http://www.bobpowell.net/pixel_dot.aspx 
The [Yellow Book](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/) exists - so you can learn the basics without spending money 😉
your length equation looks a little suspect.
Where does `length` come from in your `Normalize` method?
Things will be deprecated, but the solution to that would be looking it up on MSDN
perhaps you could post into pastebin your more complete code. 
Not a book but I'll jump to Pluralsight for the rest of my training.
Is "length" a property? I.E. private float L; public float length { get { return L; } set { L = value; } } Otherwise this won't work at all because your "Normalize()" function is depending on a variable that might change when you use "Scale()". "Length()" should depend on variables within the class... Your class object should be storing a value for x, and for y. You shouldn't have to pass these with a static function like "Length" unless it's a private static function. "Normalize()" doesn't have any clue what the variable "length" is because "length" is an undefined variable. If "length" is defined in the Vec2 Class object, because "Length()" is a static function, it won't be able to access the length instance variable.
I agree - OP can use this book to learn C# programming, but there is so much new stuff he'd have to read another book just to catch up. So rather than 2x the time and 1x the cost of a new book. Better to spend 1x on the new book and 1x of the time.
I'd like to point out that learning 2.0 will make learning 3.0 easier and make you understand some stuff better. I am grateful I learned C and Assembler and Java and C++. All of these things help me everyday writing C#. Not the syntax but the better understanding of what's going on under the covers. Don't become a 2.0 expert, but rather get started with it and then switch to a newer book. So I would say the answer to your question is to do both. (But you don't need books.. There's A LOT online). 
You have multiple ways to do raster graphics. No one of them is "the best". It all depends on multiple things. Your goal may be to: * Generate a picture into a file * Display generated picture immediately * Display whole process of generating picture (display a changing picture) Optimal solutions are wholly different based on this. If you want it just quick (to code) and dirty (to run), you can use System.Drawing.Bitmap and its method SetPixel(int x, int y, Color color); This will be extremely slow. If you want to make it faster, you can use Bitmap.LockBits() and Bitmap.UnlockBits() and modify BitmapData using marshalling - but it's not as straight-forward, because you are basically writing directly to the memory of the image. You can do something better by using System.Drawing.Graphics. You create new Bitmap and then use Graphics.FromImage(bitmap). Resulting Graphics object has nice methods to draw lines, circles etc. But not pixels, since this can be used on vector images also. (BTW you can generate sierpinski triangle by drawing triangles also, but that could not be what you're looking for) Each of these methods will give you Bitmap image which you can save. If you want, you can search the internet for a method to display it in UI (either WinForms or WPF), but you won't get high FPS from this - it's not built to do this. (Of course I am talking about displaying the image without the step of saving it to disk first, although that is certainly also possible) One framework (which is total overkill, but easy to use) I like is [Emgu CV](http://www.emgu.com). That is OpenCV in C#, and it allows you to work with images really easy and pretty fast. For true smooth animations however, you should try Direct2D through [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org/) or through [Directx4WPF](https://directx4wpf.codeplex.com/). These projects don't have the best documentation possible for a novice (myself included), but you can study the examples and google yourself through it, with just the right amount of pain and success. ;-)
The book is fine, there are a lot of cool features in later versions but the vast majority of stuff is for advanced programming anyway. If you are looking into getting the fundamentals of OOP a book from 2005 will be just fine. 
I disagree. I mean, Winforms can be drawn directly onto. Override the OnPaint method, grab the e.Graphics object and use it to paint. I've done it myself. Let's say you did this: 1. Make a winform. Make the backcolor translucent. 2. Override the winform onPaint method. Use base.onPaint(e) to keep what's there, then do a using with the e.Graphics and a brush. Use drawline with two points both set to the same co-ordinate. That's a dot. On the screen. Wherever you want.
-Lambdas &amp; expressions. (And always use the lambda /function version of linq over the long worded structure) -Unit testing -Dependency injection -Domain entity frameworks like nhb or ef -MVC -HTML/css/javascript 
Everything this. For example with linq you can do in one "line" what it used to take hundreds
Agreed but I would use the term server side over back end.
There is a very elegant way to do just this in WPF applications. The pattern is called MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and you can read about it all over the internet (combine it with keyword WPF). Basically, you create binding between property of a UI element and property of a ViewModel (your class), and changes are propagated automatically between these two. Of course you can control it in many, many ways, but this is imho exactly what you're looking for.
I'm a hands-on learner, so I would say to think of a medium-scale project you'd like to do (maybe a book or movie library that pulls information from the web), and dig into it. Start with a main form, add a few widgets, get it to do something simple, like maybe update one control based on the input from another. Then experiment with classes, using them to store information. Arrays and lists can allow you to store multiple things in one structure. At this point, you should work on separating the logic of your program from the logic of how to display the information. (model-presentation/view). At first, just have the program start out blank each time, but when it starts to take shape, work on persisting the data. Start out by serializing to XML, and then look at how to use lightweight databases. Next, learn how to consume a web service. Find one that allows you to submit an ISBN number, and it return some basic information about the movie or book. At some point, your application should reach the point where it allows you to enter ISBNs, it pulls some information about each item from the web, and persists it in some kind of storage. Now, work on your interface some, learning about how to present the data in accessible ways. Maybe you can break down some presentation logic into smaller pieces - for example, instead of having all the logic inside that main form, maybe you make a custom control that knows how to "display a movie" or "display a list of movies". Experiment with events to connect those controls together for interactivity. At this point you've learned some valuable lessons about what not to do. Now, refactor things - make it better. Learn about LINQ, iterative patterns, observable patterns, .NET library types that will make your life easier, etc. Can you persist data to the cloud, and make a phone app to access your library? Or what about two people who share a library? Can you add features like book/movie lending and reminders? I think if you get bogged down on a list of stuff to read about, you won't really understand what you're reading in a way that translates to "how to be a developer". As someone who hires jr. developers, I'm far more interested in what you last coded and your journey doing it than the trivia you know about a language. As a Sr. guy, I would be mentoring you in the latter through code reviews and pair programming. What I need are people who can solve problems and get past hurdles on their own - get stuff done, and a senior person can show you how to make it easier on yourself next time.
I don't know about events and JSON serialization, BUT If you serialize (and deserialize) using DataContractSerializer, you can use attribute [DataContract(IsReference = true)] on your data classes (or just the top level class). By using this attribute, the serialization engine automatically identifies which object is which and stores this information in serialized data.
Think of a server as just another computer that hosts everything. Of course a laptop can act as a server, but it would need to always be on, otherwise no other computer would be able to connect to it. You'd also want decent bandwidth since computers will constantly be reading/writing to it. I'd suggest paying a bit to get server space somewhere. Host your dB and app if it's a web service. Otherwise just host your dB up there since that's the guts of your program. As for optimizing, that's the beauty and the beast of developing. There's a million ways to skin a cat. If youre looking to optimize speed, that's something you can test yourself. If you want to improve some of your functions for logistics sake, that's not really something that someone can tell you is better or worse. Write maintainable code that makes sense. Congrats on finishing your first program. Mind sharing what it is? 
Here are a few added suggestions: 1. Types and assemblies 2. Arrays and lists - **Data structures. Try to build your own linkedlists, trees, dictionary, etc. You will learn a lot.** 3. Statements, expressions and operators - **If you know linear algebra, try to build a Vector/Matrix class. Great way to learn operator overloading** 4. Classes - **Polymorphism as well** 5. Structs - **Distinction between value types and reference types** 6. Members - **Look into fields vs properties** 7. LINQ - **Extremely important. It is a major language feature a lot of people overlook** 8. Program flow - **Architecture. Object ownership is a very important thing to understand for programmers (and many don't). Look into design patterns and try out different approaches to the same problem (architectually speaking). Being good at software architecture comes with experience.** Try to form some kind of small project for yourself. A simple little program that challenges you to formulate your own "task". Part of becoming a good programmer is being able to solve problems given the tools that you have. Small projects are a great in teaching yourself to think outside the streightfoward "task" box and solve issues that might not be so easy to google (since they maybe unique to your program). I hope this helps! Edit: Oh and the learning never stops. There is always some new approach to a problem or a new problem in itself. Keep yourself motivated and never assume you know "a lot" because there is a shit ton of stuff to still learn. That is what keep programming interesting!
LINQ is a little advanced, and I would easily forgive a junior developer for having no knowledge of it. But generics are essential. Interfaces should be understood even if you don't develop any yourself since the .NET framework relies on them heavily (see IDisposable). You should have some basic familiarity with common design patterns like the Disposable, Factory, and Observable patterns.
Yes, unit testing, very important and is commonly overlooked as a valuable skill. Maybe not so essential for beginners, but definitely underrated. A lot of people graduate from with SE/CS programs without being introduced to unit testing.
A rebuild is a clean and a build. The clean will delete the files.
Thanks.
I learned the basics of C# last year (2013) by reading this free e-book from 2007: http://www.charlespetzold.com/dotnet/ It assumes some knowledge in C or C++, but I'm not very confident in those languages. Newer features, such as LINQ, I have learned the usual way; by googling, reading MSDN and Stack Overflow.
I've taken two C++ classes, but that was back in college a few years ago. Is that enough to use this book?
Thanks for the information! I'll look it up later. Is it also possible to use it with WinForms? The application I want this for is a WinForms application and reqriting anything seems to be too much. :/
Any book that includes coverage of LINQ and Lambda's should do you just fine. The changes since 3.0 are relatively specialized or minor.
That's the trap. Large company: stable job, benefits, dull-as-mud workplace, politicking up the ass, tired, old-ass technology. Small company: hot, new tech, fun environment, goes bankrupt in 3 weeks.
Yeah my coworkers and I seem to use them interchangeably. Back end == server side Front end == client side 
A nullable can only wrap structs, rendering it practically useless for providing extra safety (as a struct cannot be null anyway). Further, a nullable does not expose a very safe API. The Value property can easily blow up, if you don't check for existence first. But you are not forced to check for existence. In that way, nullables might look similar on the surface, but they are conceptually quite different underneath. That being said, an optional can be used for more or less anything that a nullable can be used for, just in a more safe manner.
I don't even work in a company, I work for a federal government. Honestly I like it, I'm given the freedom to do what I want, use the technologies I want (Visual Studio version notwithstanding) I have job security and I work on interesting things. I also have great co-workers and at my level I don't have to worry about politicking. 
If you wanted a ~2006 language you should've chosen Java.
I do realize this would've been more accurate before Java 8.
For a more full-fledged functional approach, using C# 6 features, take a look at the interesting language-ext library: https://github.com/louthy/language-ext It offers a quite similar option type. Mine is a focused (and simple) alternative to all of us that use C# here and now, or people who don't want the extra functionality :)
You win one Reddit special snowflake award!
Use some kind of loop. This is ultra basic programming and telling you anymore would be doing the assignment for you, which I'm not about to do. You really need to be able to think through this yourself.
&gt; As it is I'm finding inconsistent results after each time I Build the project. Do you have any custom build actions defined? Generally, you should avoid that unless you really really need them.
You also can [create custom ones](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165394.aspx)!
You can also make your own which is nice for when you using a lot of onpropertychanged() events in WPF. I do that so I don't have to keep adding them to my setters all the time. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165394.aspx
Any developer worth his or her salt never goes back having discovered the miracle that is test coverage. Then you can do all sorts of fancy separation of concern things like moq. God I love moq. And if you're using visual studio and not using ncrunch you're doing it wrong.

Optimizing is a pretty broad term so it might be difficult to help without seeing code/structure but here are a couple things that come to mind. SQL queries: You can save tons of time/resources by learning how to build efficient sql queries. Simple things like filtering out large groups first in your where clause can drastically reduce time. Database structure: Make sure you are indexing and searching/linking off of those indexes. Code: Look into using different types of structures (loops for example). In different situations, different structures or combinations thereof may or may not be faster. As for the server; it's just another computer, you wouldn't necessarily need to install any software on the other computers except for the MySQL drivers if your doing a forms/console application. If your hosting a website then you should only need the drivers on the machine that is hosting it. (The beauty of web development).
didn't even think of that. brain fart
I've worked with this book, as well as other Gaddis books. I'd just post it here! We can gladly help!
looked. still confused. I have 4 .cs files. they all need to go into a single .dll how do I do that. i can't find anything about getting a .dll output over there-&gt; seriously, need eli5 type help here. everything i see talks about stuff i don't understand. is 'the command prompt' in Visual studio? or is it the actual system command prompt?
While that's good to know, I prefer CodeRush's `cc` command. When you type that you get constructor with all of the properties (and a checkbox to remove the ones you don't want).
Some sort of global variables system!
Either an ex-VB programmer, or a failed attempt at trolling :P
With the caveat that it will only remove files that would get copied in a build, not the entire folder. As an example, if you remove a copy local reference and there is still a copy in the bin folder, it won't get removed in a clean.
Personally? Eleven years of experience with winforms with tasteful, stylish results. [There are other reasons](https://www.bing.com/search?q=winforms+advantages+over+wpf)... I think WPF has strength in driving home the MVVM pattern (you can be lazy with windows forms) and also in graphical flexibility. 
... of course, if your files don't build, or you need references you don't have, you'll have to learn a whole lot more than that.
My favorite shortcut is cw for Console.WriteLine(); But I still use most of them pretty often, loops, props, try-catch blocks, etc..
Tab and Space. Nominees for the most used keys when VS is open :) If you haven't yet, check out ReSharper.
With resharper, alt-insert. Also automatically can generate parameters that set variables.
Based on my recollection, DrawLine with the same start and end point doesn't work. So, I tried it and confirmed that it doesn't draw anything: protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { base.OnPaint(e); // Single pixel line - won't work Point pt1 = new Point(50, 50); Point pt2 = new Point(50, 50); using (Pen p = new Pen(Color.Red, 1F)) { e.Graphics.DrawLine(p, pt1, pt2); } // 2 pixel line (for comparison) - works Point pt3 = new Point(50, 75); Point pt4 = new Point(51, 75); using (Pen p = new Pen(Color.Blue, 1F)) { e.Graphics.DrawLine(p, 50, 75, 51, 75); } // Alternative method: FillRectangle - works // (NB: Don't use DrawRectangle. It will draw a 2x2) e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Green, 50F, 100F, 1F, 1F); }
Thanks I will definitely test stuff out concerning the hosting. As for the optimizing I would mainly like for people to look over the code and give me pointers on how to improve the basics, for example stuff I could change to clean up the code, stuff I could to do improve expandability, etc The program holds personal info of people that visited an event, there are 4 "functions", first one is to create a new event, where you have to input an event name and after that you can input personal info, here you can also check if people would like to receive a newsletter and if they would like to be notified on facebook. Second is to add new people to and already existing event, so people can continue inputting fi they've accidentally closed the program. Third one is to edit all the info, entire db gets loaded into a datagrid where you can change or delete anything. Last is a function that outputs the data to an excel file, currently creates a file containing all the data of the selected event, a file that holds the first+lastname of people that want to be notified through fb and an csv file that can be directly imported into gmail containing the first+lastname and email address of everyone that wants to receive a newsletter 
Queries: could you give some examples as I'm not sure what you mean by this? DB Structure: currently I only have 1 table holding all the data, I've already noticed massive flaws btu due to time constraint I couldn't improve this at all because I don't have much knowledge about this. DO you by any chance know of any good tutorials etc where I can learn more about this? Currently I know how to create a DB with constraints, I also know how to work with PK's and FK's although not much. But I never ever used a DB in a c# program before, so I really need to learn more on that. Server: The beauty with sqlite was that I didn't need to install anything on other pc's, problem is that I can't connect multiple pcs to it. Aren't there any DB's where you can connect multiple pc's to but where you don't need to install anything? On the other hand is it possible to auto install the needed drivers for mysql, as in can I include the needed drivers with my program and just install them when I first run it?
I am mostly interested in OOP and database. My current application is programming Crestron Control Systems using C#. I am trying to figure out the most efficient way to handle the hundreds of different button presses that can come from the UI in the system and how they interact with various devices in the system. I thought that approaching it from a different point of view, like an actual software architect/developer instead of a typical audiovisual programmer might lead me down some new and interesting paths to solving the problems with a new approach. 
Related: You can store code in the Toolbox panel when in code view. There's only so many code snippets I can remember the shortcuts for, so I store a handful of code blocks in the Toolbox.
Draw Arc and Polygon take points, do they need to be closed?
FYI they're called sniplettes 
&gt; Do you have any custom build actions defined? No.
I was watching a Scott Allen Pluralsight vid today and caught the same tip. 
&gt; Snippets
Another fun little one is if you're call a method that doesn't yet exist you can right click on the call, select generate method stub and VS will auto generate a stub using intelligent guessing of the parameter and return types as well. Another one I imagine most everybody is aware of, but just in case you aren't - when you implement an interface in a class click on the interface name in the implements syntax area and you can automatically generate all the stubs, with implicit or explicit implementation available! All the auto generated methods also come with a nice little NotImplementedException thrown when called making it really easy and pleasant to get a skeleton frame of your code up and compiling in seconds.
In the past couple of weeks, I've been reading [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8). If you understand MVC and design patterns in general, it is a good reference. The bulk of the book consists of the design patterns catalog, but there's also a chapter that lays out the reasons for using patterns in broad strokes, as well as a case study involving reasons for applying multiple design patterns in a project. More than just describing the patterns themselves, some of the book focuses on the interrelationships among different design patterns. As a caveat, it references C++ and Smalltalk in its code samples, but the concepts of structuring objects and their dependencies transcend languages.
These are great advice! I have problems comming up with projects though so would love some suggestions.
We all ready have an option type for C#, it's called System.Object. What we need is a non-optional type.
Also propg for a private setter property.
&gt; A nullable can only wrap structs, rendering it practically useless for providing extra safety (as a struct cannot be null anyway). Correction: It can only wrap value types, not only structs.
Hard to say, but if you're pretty comfortable with C-like languages, it should work pretty well. Just try it, and google the parts you don't understand.
Don't forget Alt+Enter with ReSharper.
Well, isn't the distinction a bit vague? Certainly, it can wrap primitive types, but as far as I know these are considered "structs" as well - even though it isn't possible to re-implement them as structs yourself. [SerializableAttribute] public struct Nullable&lt;T&gt; where T : struct
You could add DOS commands in Pre-Build Event Command Line to remove all of the files and directories in the build directory. Granted, this can be a pain sometime.
This depends, but it will be pretty error prone. The biggest issue with switching ORMs is that the amount of ORM specific workarounds necessary/in place makes it tricky. If you're using an old NHibernate, you probably have a strong dependency on Iesi.Collections - the newer version uses the collections available in .NET 4 e.g. HashedSet&lt;T&gt; -&gt; ISet&lt;T&gt;. If your models depend on Iesi.Collections, I don't think it would be possible. It sounds like you're using MS SQL Server due to your struggles with LINQ. If that's the case, you should have gone with EF from the start. You might be able to get away using a DevArt ADO.NET driver for better NHibernate LINQ support, but you'd have to test it extensively first. I'd suggest that you keep everything as is (using NHibernate client side) and using Linq-2-SQL where necessary. 
&gt; it can wrap primitive types, but as far as I know these are considered "structs" as well A struct is a value type, but a struct is not a primitive.
I also like to use cw and tab twice for Console.WriteLine("");
People often make this comparison, but it's easy enough to secure a RESTful API, it's just not part of the pattern and guidance. HTTPS/TLS provides transport level security You can control method level access and general access control with API keying in headers You can provide verification signatures in headers. The only perceived negative is that these things aren't part of a locked-down spec, so can vary in implementation. WS-Security is nothing more than these things in a spec, bundled on top of SOAP. (The transports are the same, so it's by default no more or less secure). 
Maybe you should give /r/dotnet or /r/programmingdiscussion a shot.
I just checked. There are no ReSharper updates available, but I still get this: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xngmiCE.png) This is only because of ReSharper. During initialization, when I just opened the solution, it's shown as it should be: blue, with no error. Once ReSharper analyzed the project it shows this as an error. When uninstalling ReSharper it's shown correctly too.
dB means decibel :D
You don't even need to reach for mouse. Type the method name, type params, press Ctrl+. (ctrl and dot) and Enter. Voila! The same goes for objects from namespaces that aren't yet imported - type "var r = Regex rgx;", Ctrl+., choose "using System.Text.RegularExpression". Or if you typed name of the class that doesn't exists, Visual Studio will offer to make a class for you. Then you can make methods for the class in the same way... Ctrl + . (ctrl and dot) and Ctrl + , (ctrl and comma) are your best friends in Visual Studio.
I'm hearing a lot of people say good things about ReSharper. I'll have to look into it.
I'm a `while (true)` kind of guy, myself.
This article points out one aspect, XML vs JSON, of why SOAP lost, but there are several, far more important aspects to why SOAP lost. First, if SOAP lost, then what won? REST won, and it won because of scalability issues. Having a massively available API built on REST is much more feasible than on SOAP because the caching mechanisms already implemented for HTTP requests could be reused, while SOAP didn't offer much in that respect. Add to that the bloated payload of a SOAP message and its makes a huge difference for a massively available API such as Google Maps. Second, SOAP is about contracts and defined types, where the languages that were more focused on consuming all these APIs are all weakly typed, if not dynamic, languages. This simply creates a barrier for those languages to consume those APIs, which makes consuming a JSON API a much easier task . Lastly, the tooling surrounding XML in languages like javascript, Ruby, and php are very tedious. So constructing the XML for the request or parsing the response are a complete pain (does anyone feel like learning XPath?). The JSON support is much more robust, just because its much simpler to deal with. Not to mention I wouldn't be surprised if the JSON parser is faster in most cases.
&gt; HTTPS/TLS provides transport level security You can control method level access and general access control with API keying in headers You can provide verification signatures in headers. Mostly agree. Message-level security is also important, especially in situations where the TLS is terminated at the load balancer. The message remains encrypted while in transit internally. The locked down spec *is* important, because people rolling their own will lead to mistakes and inconsistencies and are a waste of time, particularly if another framework will do it for you as a configuration instead of code. Agreed JSON is not at fault, but there is no standard spec equivalent to WS-security or WS-trust.
This is an excellent book, considered by many to be *the* reference on Design Patterns. [Head First Design Patterns](http://books.google.ca/books/about/Head_First_Design_Patterns.html?id=GGpXN9SMELMC&amp;redir_esc=y) is another book to consider, definitely a secondary source to the GoF, but much easier to read. 
yep, this is very handy. One that I've created myself that I find immensively useful is something to declare the member variable, public property and wire up the RaisePropertyChanged. I wish it could be done via an attribute so I wouldn't have to have all this extra stuff but the snippet removes most of the pain.
Sure, I can name a few advantages to equality provided by ValueUtils over that in ReSharper: - The client code is a lot shorter and easier to read - unlike resharper, ValueUtils doesn't need to insert a lot of boilerplate code into your source. - Your classes are robust to modification. I maintain a large code-base, and custom `Equals` and `GetHashCode` implementations have been the source of nasty bugs on several occasions. Essentially, if you ever edit that class to add a field - that new field won't be considered by the statically generated code, nor will you receive any warning - your code will just break. - Superior hash mixing algorithm: resharper mixes in 32-bits, ValueUtils in 64-bits, and resharper uses the same prime factor for each stage. In essence, resharper is using a hash mixing suitable for a stream of arbitrary size, even though it actually knows exactly how many fields it contains. Also, the choice of constant 397 is slightly risky - because the number is so low, bits from adjacent fields aren't mixed very well (you're essentially affecting bits at most 9 to the left, and ideally, you'd affect them all). - You don't need a resharper license 
Yep, that helps a lot but I really just don't like having to do int _someThing; public int SomeThing{ get { return _someThing; } set { _someThing = value; RaisePropertyChanged(); } } Lot of extra cruft when normal properties are down to one line
After asking around to some of the other devs at my company apparently they all use Ctrl + . frequently. I can see how that is immensely useful.
With my larger projects I like to do Interception Policy Injection. Properties stay auto and code is built around them using a dynamic proxy at run-time. This also helps with logging and security. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff660871%28v=pandp.20%29.aspx
Awesome. Much better pitch :)
You could probably implement this pretty easily. I guess it would be the same as the toolbox for a WinForms application. Perhaps take a look in the visual studio add on gallery? 
As /u/carny666 said, the Toolbox when you're in code view. I store a lot of snippets in there because (1) I can remember only so many keyboard shortcuts, and (2) I hate to clutter up intellisense.
Thanks! To be honest, the real reason I use this (and wrote this) is simplicity. Plain values are so short, so easy to reason about - it's a boon. Even if the alternative is automatically generated - do you actually enforce that at compile time? At test-time? How can you tell it's generated code? Not to mention that bugs in equality implementations are really subtle and often are only triggered in data-dependent scenarios. How quickly are you going to notice when that 8-th field isn't considered for equality? How many people know that `struct` hashcodes can are in practice sometimes completely constant, leading to catastrophic performance? Really, I'd want a proper record type, and this is my band-aid. But heck, better a band-aid than nothing, I say :-).
If OP is new to coding I would say your estimates are generous. It's one thing to have experience learning the news version of a language but if it's your first rodeo there can be a steep learning curve. I agree though, better to get an updated book. OP if you are an experienced coder C# In Depth is awesome. It's not going to make you a .NET stud but one read through with some basic comprehension and you'll be leagues ahead of other entry level C# coders.
What do you mean "opening up each button"? You mean without attaching/writing an event handler? EDIT: Also, you're on [thin ice](http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/2msoya/high_school_programming_help/cm77ukd?context=10000). Tread carefully.
I WAS JOKING! :( and yes thank you that is what I meant.. 
So close to that record class in C#6, yet so far :)
Can you use a debugger? It will help you figure out what's wrong. I think your if is missing the parantheses, and the check only covers the Console.WriteLine and not also the next statement. if (inputString != null) { Console.WriteLine(inputString); grades[count++] = int.Parse(inputString); } 
Thank you! any chance you could help me again? why isn't this piece of code working? if( (button1.Text) &amp;&amp; (button2.Text) &amp;&amp; (button3.Text) ); 
Every piece of code works. It just doesn't do what you want. There's a difference. What is it supposed to do?
Once more I have edited it and errors are still occurring: if( (button1.Text == "X") &amp;&amp; (button2.Text == "X") &amp;&amp; (button3.Text == "X") ); 
Semicolon denotes end of statement. Your next symbol should be an opening curly brace. {
Thank you 
thank you
What IS the difference between Parse and TryParse?
It says right there in the link: &gt; The TryParse method is like the Parse method, except the TryParse method does not throw an exception if the conversion fails. It eliminates the need to use exception handling to test for a FormatException in the event that s is invalid and cannot be successfully parsed. In other words TryParse is safer because if it fails it will just set your out parameter to null, which you can handle in your code ( if (result != null) do stuff... )
Since I'm also a beginner I need to ask: Is there a need for algorithms? I don't see anyone mentioning algorithms. Anyway, if you do care about them I suggest the book [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844).
Cool project! A few observations: - You might want to consider what it means to create an `Option.Some(default(string))` - option, as is, doesn't actually prevent nulls, it just makes intentional nulls more obvious. - You can use an implicit conversion operator with a special `OptionNone` type to avoid the dirty `Option.None(meaninglessValueHere)` parameter. If you're interested in a collaborator, I'm in :-).
I'm in a similar position as OP but I want to get into ASP.NET. Do I need to know something else besides the list you mention and the obvious (ASP.NET)?
Strange, I knew that instantly as the answer to the question, but suddenly realised I've never used it. I hate building new snippets, even when I remember how to, I never remember my shortcuts after a while, I am amazed it never clicked to utilise the tool bar THAT I KNEW ABOUT! Stupid brain. I'm off to clutter up my nice, clean, text tool bar now.
This is clearly spam, especially for a **C# language** subreddit.
Actually, TryParse, returns false, since you can't set value types null.
It might seem a little intimidating when you're first starting out, but MSDN is a great reference that you'll reference often regardless of your skill level. When you're starting out, it might be a good idea to just browse it and get a feel for how its laid out, especially because it includes so many examples. Even for an experienced programmer, a large part of coding in .NET is simply being aware of what's available.
He's the best!
Hmmm. I started web development back when all those personal websites and game community sites were popular. Making something large and complex is not a good start with ASP.NET if you are just starting off. If you have a static website; ie were the user doesn't manipulate the data, you can start by replacing the front end strings and variables with one's on the backend (on the C# side rather than HTML). Then you can start manipulating data you display little by little, say, displaying today's date using the backend, until you start being comfortable. With time you can start making more and more complex pages using dynamic data. Start with static data for now. I hope this helps. I am not sure if I gave you a very clear answer.
Fantastic! I'll have to grab the trial. 
What spawns your child thread with the TCPListener? I think if you spawn that thread from your UI thread then Dispatcher.BeginInvoke() should work.
Solved it; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2663070/how-do-i-get-the-ui-thread-dispatcher Application.Current.Dispatcher has the UI thread Dispatcher I needed :)
It's App_StartUp originated call. However, I found Application.Current.Dispatcher has the UI thread's Dispatcher. So that worked fine :)
Does anyone know if it's possible to create custom JavaScript snippets? Edit: Figured it out, just set the language to 'JavaScript' in the definition and import as normal.
You will have to do a if statment like this
 if (progressBar1.Value + 3 &gt; progressBar1.Maximum) { //Filled up MessageBox.Show("Filled"); } else { progressBar1.Value++; }
If this "if" is supposed bo be checked every second, it should be else { progressBar1.Value += 3; }
It was just a quick code snippet i made, so i didnt think about things like that
In general, it'd be better to just set it to what the maximum actually is, but you should also try to make sure you only set acceptable values. In this case, you could do something like bar.Value = Math.Min(progressCounter, bar.MaxValue); If you don't *have* a known maximum, you shouldn't be using a "determinate" progress bar (ie. one that has a filled part and an empty part), but an indeterminate one - for example setting its style to Marquee or something.
What are you doing in your delegate? You should be able to update your vm from any thread without having to worry about. It's only a problem if you try to call a method of the view from a thread other than the other end that created it. The binding shouldn't care what thread raised the PropertyChanged event. 
It's the way you're getting to the vm that's causing the problem, not setting the value. If you were to pass that in as a parameter when you start the background thread, it wouldn't complain. If that's not easy you could use the dispatcher to grab the vm on the ui thread and then just hanging on to the instance in a class variable or something. Going through the dispatcher every time you want to set a value is a lot of overhead. Maybe it doesn't matter I am this case but it's not a great pattern. 
await, async.
I'm not entirely sure the UI thread is even done/available at the time the "server"-thread is started. App.xaml &lt;Application x:Class="CCApp_POC.App" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" Startup="App_Startup"&gt; &lt;Application.Resources&gt; &lt;/Application.Resources&gt; &lt;/Application&gt; App.xaml.cs void App_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e) { CreateServer(); } private static void CreateServer() { ... //create a tcplistener, etc. and when a connection occurs, update VM ... } MainWindow.xaml.cs public partial class MainWindow : Window { public MainWindow() { DataContext = new CustomerViewModel(); InitializeComponent(); } } 
I'm pretty new to the concept of relational DB's, however I've learned about it in theory. That also means that I have no clue how to use it in practice. But now that I have no time constraint to improve the program I have decided to learn about it. I have multiple questions about it: - I'm planning to split my DB up in multiple tables (I'm a sucker in naming tables), Event_Table Event_ID| Event_Name ---|--- 1| Party 2| Afterparty Info_Table User_ID| First_Name| Last_Name| Zipcode_ID ---|---|---|---|--- 1| Liam| Smith | 1 2| Mason| Johnson | 2 3| Alexander| Williams | 1 4| Ethan| Jones | 2 Zipcode_Table Zipcode_ID| Zipcode| City ---|---|--- 1| 20004| Washington 2| 10007| New-York Data_Table Event_ID| User_ID ---|--- 1| 1 1| 2 1| 3 2| 1 2| 4 - My first and imo most important question is, is this DB decently formed? I know this is a very broad question and it depends on what I plan to do with it. So please feel free to ask about anything and everything. If you would prefer me to fully explain what I want to do with the DB please tell me and I will try and type it out in a different reply. - Is there any point in making a 'Zipcode_ID', can't I use the 'Zipcode' as PK, if I set it to 'UNIQUE' and don't make it 'AUTO-INCREMENT' - How do I know what is connected to an ID, for example I want to see every user that has been to the afterparty, currently while using 1 table I select all data that has been to an event called afterparty. I think I need to var select_event_id = select 'Event_ID' from 'Event_Table' where 'Event_Name' = "txtInput.text" var select_user_id = select 'User_ID' from 'Data_Table' where 'Event_ID' = "select_event_id" and then input that data into a gridview? - Is it possible to auto fill a textbox with 'City' from 'Zipcode_Table' when someone enters a zipcode that already is in my table? - What is the best way to ensure that the event names are unique, currently I've made the column 'UNIQUE', but this only ensures its unique in the DB, in my program I input all the 'Event_Names' into a list and compare the input with that list. Is this a good way to do this or are there more efficient, easier ways to do it? - Follow up to the previous question, currently when you add capitalizations or spaces in front, behind or randomly in the 'Event_Name' it registers it as a new input, how can I prevent this? I've been thinking about making everything lowercase first before anything happens at all, so make input lowercase then get select data from DB, make that data lowercase, input it into a list, then compare. But this doesn't solve the issues with spaces. - Similar question as the one above, how do I ensure that every 'User_ID' is in fact a unique user? I think I just need to make some sort of boolean that gets set to true when fnameinput = 'First_Name' and lnameinput = 'Last_Name' - And for now my last question, is it possible to make some sort of suggestion list? With this I mean, if i type the name "w" into my firstname box is it possible to get a dropdownlist with every name that starts with "w"?
The problem is that you're instantiating your VM in the constructor of your view where nothing else can get to it without going through the view (which must be done on same thread the view was created on). I slapped together a little example of a better way to do it that avoids having to worry about threads at all. (Edit: made the thread a background thread so it doesn't keep the application running after you close the window) App.xaml.cs: public partial class App : Application { public VM VM { get; private set; } public App() { VM = new VM(); //Kick off a thread that increments a counter every 1.5 seconds and set // VM.SomeString to that value. new System.Threading.Thread( () =&gt; { int i = 0; while (true) { VM.SomeString = i++.ToString(); System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.5)); } }) { IsBackground = true } .Start(); } } VM.cs: public class VM : INotifyPropertyChanged { public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged; private void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName) { if (PropertyChanged != null) PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } private string _someString; public string SomeString { get { return _someString; } set { _someString = value; OnPropertyChanged("SomeString"); } } } MainWindow.xaml.cs: public partial class MainWindow : Window { public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent(); } protected override void OnInitialized(EventArgs e) { base.OnInitialized(e); DataContext = ((App)Application.Current).VM; } } I just hooked this all up to a textbox in the MainWindow.xaml like so: &lt;TextBox Text="{Binding SomeString}" Width="50"/&gt;
Doesn't look like I'll have to make many drastic changes.. I'll see if I can move my variables around to get it to work like that. Get back in a jiffy! Edit: If I tried to access the VM variable from the CreateServer function, it complained that I had to access an object reference of it, rather than directly. So I had to use ((App)Application.Current).VM there as well. But now I won't have to use a delegate :) Thanks! 
Yes- but you either have a fixed maximum value or you don't. If you do, you're fine. If not, you shouldn't be doing anything like this in the first place. ;)
Hi there, assuming txt_Search is your TextBox, you want to use txt_Search.Text to access and/or modify the current Text in the TextBox.
Thank you, that did it! This is challenging to say the least.
From looking at it; here are my suggestions: * Call your tables what they are, for instance your info_table actually seems to be a "user_table" and data_table is not very descriptive as everything in a database is essentially data. * You should be fine keeping your zipcode/city/state inside info_table. Try to keep things relatively simple as you are just learning about databases. * To find out what is connected to the id you can use a query like this Select first_name, last_name from data_table where event_id = '2' left join info_table on info_table.user_id = data_table.user_id This will pair the event and data tables together and show only the users who have been to the after party. Also, this is easily accomplished if you are using object oriented programming and can assign an id to each of your objects, otherwise you may have to query off of the user name to get their id (Select user_id from user_table where first_name = 'liam' and last_name = 'smith') * autofill is possible, if you put your zipcodes in their own table you could have a query similar to (select city from zipcode_table where zipcode = yourVariableFromThe TextBox) * I would compare the new event name to the events in the actual database and not a list that you have previously populated. You want fresh data, Imagine if you extracted a list from the db and used that while the program was open without refreshing it from the database and someone else added the same event. * Next question is all about validation, lookup the Trim method to remove whitespace and run the string through a custom function that makes sure your data doesn't contain any special characters. Also look up regex if you need specific formatting. * to ensure that every user is unique, you can query your database for the first/last name of the new user being entered, if you find matching results then don't allow it to be saved. * Last questionL: aquick simple way is to use the SQL's LIKE (select first_name from user_table where first_name like '%whateverTheUserIsTyping%') The % signs are wildcards so any word the has text before or after the specified search value will be included.
Do you have to be signed up with xamarin to be able to access it via nuget? cant seem to find it in extensions and updates on VS.
The maximum value is fixed, however the amount that is added to progressbar1.Value each tick is not fixed. My problem is that i want to trigger something when the progressbar is filled, even if it surpasses the (set) max value of the progressbar.
Then your bar's max value is wrong. What's the process you're trying to represent the progress of, and what values are you currently using for max and increments?
hey! Use checkbox for some criterias, then filter the animals like this: List&lt;Animal&gt; animals = VP.Where(p=&gt;p.IsVaccined == cheVaccined.Checked); for other criterias, use textbox (for age or weight), then compare the values like this VP.Where(p=&gt;p.IsVaccined == cheVaccined.Checked &amp;&amp; p.Weight == Convert.ToInt32(teWeight.Text) &amp;&amp; ... check for nulls, empty strings, etc edit: typos
No, but it'd help if you stated up-front that there WAS no process and you were just bullshitting. :p Use Min() like I said in my earlier post. Edit: oh, and, you don't need the A and B variables at all.
My life has changed.
I know right, I just discovered you can do this with a lot of things: if, else, try, switch, prop, propg, propfull, do
Ask your friends to test it? Post it to github for people to download? http://www.centercode.com/testers/
More thank likely this is just syntactic sugar, which almost never changes compiler output.

I'm a .NET developer that also had my passion sparked by making AOL progs in VB3/4/5/6. If you ever have any questions about software development, c#, or whatever, feel free to PM me.
It was part of this idea that I wanted to make something simple (I.e. this was a small library with not a lot to do), and make sure I can do it correctly before I move on to bigger projects. This by any means is not meant to be groundbreaking or anything. I'm starting a job in January as a C# developer, and wanted to do a little something to make sure I have my chops in terms of "properly" coding. Also, for the app I'm making, it'll be a little easier without code just flying around everywhere, and using a library like I would any other. 
oh like that. Well you have the enterprise mindset down. Overengineered, overdocumented and way too much code!
What changes would you make to this? In regards to the too much code thing, what would you change?
I'm trying to understand what it does and where to place it, but I'm having trouble. And I thought I understood how to program in C# :P EDIT: I'm using a ComboBox for the menu criteria they can use to search.
&gt; I do my own **unit testing** of course but I'm afraid of bias. So wait, are you expecting to get people to write _unit tests_ for you to avoid "bias"?
Programming should always be a constant challenge. You're forced to learn and progress as a developer. You'll look back at this exercise in 6 months and roll in the floor laughing at how difficult you thought this was.
That always happens and it's really nice to know how far one has come, not saying that this final appointment is difficult for you guys, but for me it really is.

I know that there is an edit and continue function, I was just wondering if anyone knows how to make the process faster. Ideally it would be like eclipse. You edit the code, not in break mode, and the changes will be applied to the running app.
I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with you on the over-documented claim. I think the project is well documented, not to mention MonsterAbe here is actually using "using" blocks where he should be. While I do agree that this may not be deserving of its own entire library (perhaps a class inside a library that contains more like this?), it's still a pretty good solution and I'd probably write something similar. I'll go over it and see if I have any suggestions (which I'll do like 0xffff2 is going to do; pull requests).
Way too much documentation, which doesn't have to be bad. I am not sure that this is really worthy of a library but whatever floats your boat. Also, I like your coding style :)
Just received it, thanks! I'll look at it when I get home. Input is SUPER appreciated!
For future reference, you should either ensure your code is formatted properly, or better yet put your code on GitHub or a similar site and just link it. Here's the properly formatted code: private static void CalcNetSales(string[] names, double[] grossSales) { double[] salaryRange = { 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 }; double[] netSales = new double[10]; double nSales = 0; foreach (double sale in grossSales) { if (sale &gt;= salaryRange[4]) { int x = salaryRange.Length - 1; while (x &gt; salaryRange[4]) { const double COMMISSIONRATE = 0.09; const double PAY = 200; nSales = COMMISSIONRATE * sale + PAY; --x; for (int s = 0; s &gt; netSales.Length; ++s) { netSales[s] = nSales; Console.Write(netSales[x] + " "); } } } } foreach(int sale in netSales) { Console.WriteLine(netSales[sale].ToString("c")); } }
You don't appear to have actually asked a question either, or even told us what's not working. We're not just going to do you homework for you.
The main pieces I'm stuck on are passing the calculated net sales to a new array, and how to use an "array of counters" to determine how many salespeople earned salaries within specific ranges. I know how to create a range array, just don't know how to use it. As for the formatting, it looked fine when I typed it in, not like the mess that appeared when I posted it.
I'll show you how to get them back in the next episode. Stay tuned.
You are using a for each loop, with an if statement with a while loop with a for loop. Some restructuring should occur.
No need to decompile the String class anymore :) http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/string.cs,8281103e6f23cb5c
That's right and I'll be covering it in the next episode.
BTW, if you're interested in Reference Source, you might be interested in a project I'm working on: http://sourcebrowser.io. It takes C# (and soon [VB .NET](https://github.com/CodeConnect/SourceBrowser/pull/47)) projects and turns them into HTML. Search isn't up yet, but I should be merging it into mainline tonight or tomorrow.
What would the testers do specifically? If you've devised your own encryption method, then you need to get it peer-reviewed by industry professionals. Making secure encryption schemes is basically impossible without specific training in the subject. If you're using an existing algorithm, then a suite of automated unit tests should cover most of your cases. 
Sent.
I've tried to get it peer-reviewed. I've emailed many cryptographers. One replied and said I should read a book on the topic. Maybe, but I'm not a novice at programming. I've been a programmer since 1985, asm originally. The app does use Blowfish a bit. But not AES. I have a white paper I wrote on my web site which hopefully explains it in detail. Testers would run it on their own system, which isn't mine. Try to use it and give me feedback. If you have any peer review ideas I've love to here them.
Well, the title says what it's talking about, nobody said it's particularly important: you chose to watch it...
You're on reddit, complaining about wasting time? 
[Overview of Custom Storage Providers for ASP.NET Identity](http://www.asp.net/identity/overview/extensibility/overview-of-custom-storage-providers-for-aspnet-identity)
IdentityReboot is not another implemented of ASP.NET Identity 2.0, it's an alternative way of identity handling.
Identity 2.0 is by far not dependent on EF. There simply is a provided default storage implementation that uses EF.
Funny how multiple people work on exactly the same project at once. :-)
Not spent too much time on looking at the code, but saw this majestically piece of code: for (int s = 0; s &gt; netSales.Length; ++s) Take a close look at it. Go through it logically. How often will this execute?
Well, they're just wrappers for number types (byte, int, etc)...
Can someone summarise the video?
Which part don't you understand? Take a string, split it by specific characters, for each splitted-group you take the length, transform the length integer to it's ASCII character representation and concat those characters. Take a closer look at the strings. They contain non-printable characters that are used for this *magic trick*. They first string contains 1079 characters, the second string contains 1 character. You can write the same code like this, when using printable characters: string.Concat("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".Split(new[]{"b"},0).Select(a=&gt;(char)a.Length))

I don't think OP needed it explained :P
Too late, he's flagged as a noob now.
== calls the static member string.Equals whereas .Equals is a instance member and will throw a NullReferenceException.
I recently decoupled Identity 2 from EF in a project. its fairly strait forward. you will need to create a custom user store class which implements the interfaces which are relevant to to your project, I used: IUserPasswordStore&lt;ApplicationUser, int&gt;, IUserEmailStore&lt;ApplicationUser, int&gt;, IUserSecurityStampStore&lt;ApplicationUser, int&gt; then in your user manager class create a new instance of your user store in the constructor: public UserManager() : base(new CustomUserStore()) { } Hope this helps, let me know if you need more detail.
Yes, the "Gang of Four" book is still the masterpiece to learn a modern approach to OO software design. Don't look at it as a simple list of design patterns: it will give you a mental approach to problem solving in OO languages that will be helpful in every domain you will encounter in the future. Starting from that book, I suggest you to take a look at AGILE/Extreme Programming approach: "Test Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck is the preferrable starting point (but UI programming is not the best domain for TDD learning). From this 2 main points, the next step is up to you, really. There so many paths starting from them to refine your knowledge of modern sofware design (i.e. lately I discovered BDD as an interesting approach).
Hey guys, @_InternetGuy: Currently, Telerik UI for Xamarin is distributed only via Telerik.com. At some point, we may start supporting a NuGet feed, thank you for your feedback. @issafram: Apologies if the title caused a confusion, it was not deliberate. Originally, the blog resides at blogs.telerik.com where "Telerik" is not something necessary, and right next the title in reddit it is pointed out that the content comes from a Telerik source.
I personally prefer a more robust approach: 1. Abstract an e-mail sender and (mail) message. 2. Implement a SMTP e-mail sender using [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) for dev to check via [SMTP Imposter](https://ssfd.codeplex.com/). 3. Implement a Mandrill e-mail sender for production. 4. Configure which to use app.config/web.config (default to SMTP) and use xdt:transform to switch to Mandrill for production when doing a publish. (You can use [SlowCheetah](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/69023d00-a4f9-4a34-a6cd-7e854ba318b5) to transform app.config on release builds for non-web projects) Now that you've got your structure in place, the 'templating' part is an implementation detail. You could easily use [RazorEngine](https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine), but I prefer [DotLiquid](https://github.com/formosatek/dotliquid) as it's easier for non-devs (although most of my sites use a custom templating engine I wrote that's even more user friendly). This is the 'general' approach I use, although in projects that require scheduling I use a table based database queue to benefit from transactions, as transactions typically trigger e-mails and e-mails shouldn't go out if the action failed and always if it succeeded.

The thing that bothers me the most is passing an integer instead of StringSplitOptions
Try it and see.
Well damn. after decades of OTB I find Allman pretty hard to read, it requires a mental reformatting.
Same here, but at least when it is good code it is usually easy to read regardless.
my eysies they burn!!!!! seriously tho refactor that before someone gets hurt
Someone get that guy a copy of resharper!
Line 89 is not 1TBS (omits braces) 
In addition, I'd define that literal as a constant.
Yes. But that doesn't invalidate the point.
Hehe, I use Allman exclusively and have a hard time reading 1TB. In 1TB I always have the feeling, that something's missing. This is especially true while reading javascript... Also in Visual Studio, it makes more sense to me, if highlighted braces are on the same column. But maybe that's just me.
I won't start a formatting religious war here, I'm old and set in my ways (and OTB is more natural if you have to do a lot of javascript, for example). Seeing that Allman is basically how VS formats out of the box, it's natural that it's the most used. ^^^Allman ^^^is ^^^still ^^^wrong ^^^though! ^^^Embrace ^^^the ^^^OTB!
If you want to be able to chain methods (aka avoid null errors), you can setup a ".SafeEquals" string extension method. A useful shortcut, especially if you have a custom equality comparison method for a plain old class.
You shouldn't need to. *Inherited* satisfies the requirement that it "is a" *base*. If we cast *Inherited* to a *base* then we must expect it to behave like *base* is expected to. You should never have downwards dependency in inheritance. *Base* should be completely agnostic to whether or not it is being inherited. 
Does Type.IsSubclassOf do what you're asking about? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.issubclassof.aspx ObjectToTest.GetType().IsSubclassOf(typeof(Base)) will return true for the inherited one but false for the base class. 
Abstraction matters. Inheritance doesn't. If you don't seal your class, the derived class has the same "interface" plus some more (maybe). So the answer is: There is no need to distinguish.
Ya, I see what you're saying. I very new to all this (used to be an English major), so working through code really forces me to think differently. I like the challenge but sometimes I get so wound up in a problem I can't see what the hell has gone wrong. :) I can work through it most of the time, but there's something about arrays I just can't wrap my head around. The only question I could think of last night was "What the fuck am I doing?" :P I started over, and am making (slow) progress.
It'll also return false for any other type.
This seems to work, with passing it other types.
What if there was a need to distinguish, the IsA because an issue. someMethod (obj As Base) someMethod (obj Is Base) The second would require an explicit cast to be used by an inherited type.
I don't have an answer for you, but are you using WinForms, WPF or something else?
Well then add a check to see if it is the type of the base class and you will know for sure.
To do that the right way, you would implement multiple interfaces (x is A &amp;&amp; x is B) or (x is A &amp;&amp; x is C). So it would be an exclusion case. To do it dirty, you would require reflection. EDIT: Also perhaps have a look at the double dispatch pattern, it might solve what you need.
WinForms
Yea but that's what I'm trying to avoid, pressing pause then editing code. I might just look into making a plugin to try and come up with a better workflow.
Can you show how you're calling it? I've tested this code and it works. Likely the code you're running differs in a slightly different, _but significant_ way.
Your color picker control needs to have Control.Capture set to true. Now when you mouse out of that controls rect you'll still get mouse move events on that control. See here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.capture.aspx. There's a lot of edge conditions where you can lose a 'Capture', or another form/program can take the capture away from you. If you want a truly robust system, consider setting a global mouse hook. But don't write it yourself, using something like http://globalmousekeyhook.codeplex.com. The benefit of the global mouse hook, is maybe you want to let your user click and active another window to pick a color from. 
Thank you. I was pretty sure I correctly remembered how this worked but I wanted some confirmation without having to watch the video, and you provided this.
lol wat?
&gt; lol wat? I'm trying to get the edit and continue to function work without having to manually pause the program. Kinda like how eclipse works.
Oh, perhaps I misunderstood your comment. Were you saying that this code "works just fine with other types", or that it's producing incorrect results with other types? EDIT: If the latter, can you copy/paste your actual implementation code of `IsBase&lt;T&gt;()`, and copy/paste the _actual_ code you used to call it?
https://gist.github.com/epels/4259eb0fbd24bfa5e839 Whipped this up. Simply subscribe to the MouseMoved event.
i'm not sure of how you're gonna run this, but this is wildly expensive code to run. if you don't mind putting an extra class in there, you can gain a lot using something like: void Main() { Base a = new Base(); Base b = new Inherited(); a.IsBase.Dump(); b.IsBase.Dump(); } class abstract Base { public bool IsBase { get; protected set; } public Base() { this.IsBase = true; } } class BaseType : Base { public BaseType() { this.IsBase = false; } } class Inherited : BaseType { } --- I'm using a similar 3-class approach here, to get around the double typeof() reflection. void Main() { Base a = new BaseImplementation(); Base b = new Inherited(); a.IsBase.Dump(); b.IsBase.Dump(); } abstract class Base { public bool IsBase { get; protected set; } } class BaseImplementation : Base { public BaseImplementation() { this.IsBase = true; } } class Inherited : Base { }
i think i'm with you. the fact that Base in the example above is non-abstract base class to multiple other classes seems to be a code smell to me.
When I walk around my office I see about half and half between light and dark. Don't seem many other random ones.
What have you tried? There are [plenty of resources](https://www.google.ca/webhp?gws_rd=ssl#q=C%23+xml) for you use, and various ways of reading XML in C#. Pick one, try it. If it works, great. If it doesn't, come back and ask a _specific question_ about why your _specific exact code_ doesn't work.
Seeing what bug you have there, the best advice I can give is to draw on literal paper what you want (not in code) and check line by line if it matches what you are doing. Also, have they taught you how to use a break-point yet? If not that is something to look into as it lets the interface show you step by step what is going on.
This. Actually, let me go a step further: if you're asking this question, you're clearly still learning about OOP in which case I have a piece of advice: Avoid inheritance entirely, **especially as a beginner**. It's rarely necessary, and it leads to all kinds of terrible designs. Instead, start with plain classes and use **interfaces** to abstract common APIs. If you've done that for a few years, then come back and take a critical look at inheritance.
Note for the curious (just in case you didn't know): operator `==` works on Types as you'd expect. There's only one instance of a given type, so even code like the following returns true: `ReferenceEquals(typeof(List&lt;&gt;).MakeGenericType(typeof(int)), typeof(List&lt;int&gt;))` If you think about, due to the semantics of static fields (namely one field per type), this approach is rather logical since at some level the type needs to be made unique in any case.
In light of the other answers here, I'd like to point you towards "Head First: Design Patterns", which really helped OOP and related principles "click" for me. 
Very thorough book! Cover is awful, but don't judge the book by it!
You should take a look at mouse hook events. It's basically like the standard form-events (on mouse move), but for the Windows os. It enables you to get mouseposition even if the winform is not a active window. http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7294/Processing-Global-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Hooks-in-C
Github link isn't working for me.
Based on the error message, and the fact that the program works on one environment and not another, it sounds like the connection details are not correct, specifically the host name. Check the connection details are correct the on the environment where the program doesn't work. There maybe firewall restrictions on the environment, or you may need to use the IP address instead of localhost. Hope that helps
Your code link is a 404, but this means basically what it says - your application cannot connect to the database. I don't know what "PHP site" you are referring to, but this means one of two things: either your connection string is incorrect, or you cannot connect to the server on the port MySql is running on from the machine your application is hosted on (sounds like your local machine from the description). Try a telnet to the MySql server hostname and port. If you cannot connect via telnet, then it's a connection issue - possibly the port isn't open on your end or theirs. If it works, then look to your connection string. I can't remember if the MySql connector will throw this same error for a bad user / password, but if so, that is a third possibility. Do you have a valid login to the database and is it being properly set in your connection properties?
I think the hostname is correct. I just copied from the site which has the mySQL Server.
That's right. If i press the button where my programm should connect to the mysql server i get that exception.
Ok, so it works both locally, and on a server. What is the scenario where it doesn't work and you get the conenction error?
It works on my local mysql server and it works with the php site connecting to the online mysql server. This is what i do: I start the program: http://puu.sh/dsIHt/40c797e2dd.png If i press on "Get data" this happens: http://puu.sh/dsILN/b9719a3ac7.png
So it doesn't work if you are debugging your application and trying to connect to the remote (online) MySQL instance? If that is correct, I would guess that is normal behavior. When setting up a website, you wouldn't make the database publically available. It would normally be only accessible to computers on its own network (i.e. the web server which is hosting the PHP website). Of course, there can be exceptions. Does the operator of the online MySQL database state that the database is publically accessible? Do they provide a public IP address? 
Yes there is a public Ip for the mySQL Server. On the site is also a tab for "Remote mySQL" where i can put my IP adress in. But it doesn't help.
Assuming your web server and database are running on the same computer, I'm guessing MySQL isn't set up to accept remote connections. Also, remember that connecting to a database directly from a client application is a terrible idea - you may know this already, but just in case.
It's pretty silly throughout, but they're doing that on purpose to help you make it stick. :p
IIRC in mysql.d you have to enable non-local connections manually. I don't know whether you're on a VPS or shared account, but what I would do is contact whoever is providing you hosting. If you're the admin, check this out: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-enable-remote-access-to-mysql-database-server.html
Creating an interface for a pure data object generally isn't useful, however, it could be useful in this situation.
Strictly speaking, creating an interface for a pure data object is *not possible*, since interfaces can only contain functional members (methods and properties) and not data members (fields).
Correct, which is why you can't define ~~members~~ fields in an interface. Funny thing is though, a property compiles into one ~~function~~ method/behavior for the getter and, if present, another for the setter. So properties are actually parameterless behaviors that return a state, yet are grammatically equivalent to a ~~member~~ field/state.
The big question I think is, "Are these objects equal and not just equivalent?" That is, if a field gets added to the EF model, is it possible that the other two models would not need to be updated? Alternately, if the business object needs another field added to it, is it possible that the EF model will not change? If they're that closely tied, I would think you should have a class library project that is included in each layer with a single implementation. If differences can arise (which has been more common for me, but mileage may vary), then what you're probably looking for is a type conversion via constructor. This can be done with a regular constructor, or you can use a static constructor and the explicit or implicit keywords. [Relevant MSDN.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288476\(v=vs.71\).aspx) All 3 will factor the conversion logic to a common location.
No one uses field-only data objects in .NET though.
Thanks for the tip. I'll check those out :)
Yes, I'm learning that I really need to take my time going through the logic before I start actually writing the code. I tend to want to jump ahead all the time! I haven't used break-point before, but I think my teacher did mention it in passing. Thanks for the advice. Learning something new is always intimidating, so I really appreciate the response!
Especially when starting, please use break points to debug your code. Stepping line by line takes the guess work out of everything. Are you currently using Visual Studio to develop?
I have used both libraries on projects and tend to like the Postal experience more. I liked the documentation for Postal and felt that it was more fluid to work with. There was nothing wrong with MvcMailer, though...you won't go wrong with either.
Go with automapper.
After calling SetLeft, try calling UpdateLayout() on your mainform before you call GetLeft again.
Ask yourself how you're keeping track of the data in the backend. Do you have tables/records of these objects set up to mirror a schema? If so, do these fields need to stay unique for that "row" or dataset? 
On my phone but I think you want to have a global random instead of one for each instance if I recall correctly.
If at all possible, it's best to only ever have one instance of a random number generator in an application.
cool. I will remember that.
:) I'm pretty new to this myself but it was something I already came across. Glad it helped you!
One day I'm gonna "map" the knowledge of that amazing plugin. Aaaayyyoooo!
Automapper: Used it (like many, many others, seriously, it's big) and it's awesome. You can even use it (after jumping through some hoops, stackoverflow helps) with DI if you don't want to use the static `Mapper` class.
That doesn't matter. You can define an interface that contains function members that expose data. You can't define an interface that specifies that data itself.
The simple guide to a "correct" 3 layer/project application. Presentation Project (Views and ViewModels): * Dependency on Business Project and Data Project. * Instantiates all Repositories/Factories in a single class (App.xaml.cs for WPF) known as the "composition root" and injects them into viewModels/viewModelFactory * Outside of the composition root, only interfaces from the business layer are used. Business Project (core logic and definitions): * No dependencies on other layers * Defines interfaces and provides implementations for all business objects and engines * Provides interfaces but not implementations for repositories Data Project (database interop) * Dependency on Business Project * Provides implementations for repositories * Repos gets objects from database and returns them as interfaces for consumption by the other layers. Test Projects for each layer * Start testing now if you don't. * Implement the business factory interfaces with Fake/Mock factories and inject them into your production business engines etc. * Implement business engine interfaces as Fake/Mock engines and inject them into your production viewModels etc. * This is the reason you use interfaces everywhere, so you can inject fake implementations during your tests. This is basically known as dependency injection. I recommend the book Dependency Injection in .Net by Manning Publishing. It did wonders for me as a developer; transformed my entire view and increased my skill 10 fold. I also recommend doing this without any 3rd party tools besides EF at first unless you want to become another poor/average dev who is just getting by... Good Luck!
One *per thread* for the Random() class :)
Yes, this precision is really important, the Random class is not thread safe, and any concurrent call to the Next method of a Random instance would damage it. (already encountered the case of a random generator shared between threads without ensured thread safety, within a heavily loaded web app. Resulted in the random instance working for a while, until a concurrent access occurred... It then outputted only 0. Be careful and don't do that) 
Friends don't let friends use automapper.
valueinjector is another project along these same lines.
If you can't telnet then like I said, connection. Can you ping the host? If so, either the outbound port is closed on your end or the inbound is closed (at least to you) on the host.
It looks like all your randoms are getting seeded at basically the same DateTime (which isn't that accurate). You need to use a static Random so that it uses the same one and gets different numbers. 
It introduces its own pain points for sure.
That's the default behavior. The issue is that DateTime.Now has a fairly low resolution (15 ms and up) which means the same seed will be given to a bunch of instances. edit: my bad. The default implementation uses Environment.TickCount. So it will actually be the same for a full second.
In respect to automapper: in my opinion it's a tool that seems very useful because it saves you some time writing mapping code. I however is of the experience that the mapping code you write, even if it's 1:1, is very useful when maintaining the project.
Another option is thread local storage. In theory it will be faster since there is no sharing or lock contention, but you have to test it to be sure.
Why not post this on stackoverflow, so that a year from now, this question and answers can easily be found. 
It works as I expect with other types. If ```T``` is ```base``` then return true, else if ```T``` is ```inherited``` then return false, otherwise return false
This question was already answered on SO. I'm sure it was already plenty of times.
Does the style used affect the coding meaning of the code?
Ahh, excellent! Sorry for the misunderstanding and I'm glad you got a working solution. :D
When I read the OP, I was reminded of how I *used* to do it. There really isn't anything gained by making three different objects to represent the same domain object. God, the pain I used to go through to do it this way, and there was really no benefit. The way you have described it really is the best way I have found. If you need a view model based off of your domain object in the business layer, extend the business object. If there are certain fields that the user shouldn't be seeing, don't populate those properties. If there are transformations that should take place between business and presentation, again, extend the business object with viewmodel properties. IoC and DI methodologies have saved me and my team a lot of annoyance.
Do you have an article or personal experience you would like to share regarding the negative aspects of automapper? I have used it in the past, and feel like I ran into some issues, but honestly can't remember what those issues were.
I know you already have your answer, but I'd just like to add my reasoning here. I use [Environment.TickCount](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.tickcount%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) as the seed number. It is the number of milliseconds which have elapsed since the system started. If I am initializing just one Random class this always meets my needs. However, if you are initializing an array of Random classes, this can be problematic as they will all most likely contain the same seed value. Random rand = new Random(Environment.TickCount); 
I ran into the same problem making a silly password generator. Try using the "RNGCryptoServiceProvider" function under System.Security.Cryptography 
There is a very nice solution to this problem (global provider), from Jon Skeet of stackoverflow fame. http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter12/Random.aspx 
Rapid cross-platform development with .NET requires no platform-specific mobile development skills. Ready-made templates and components. True cloud-based architecture. Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VydBF3Th1RY 
Is this like Xamarin or is something like a wrapper?
There needs to be some more information here rather than buzz word bingo. * How is this better than Xamarin? * What additional features and functionality does Ubiq Mobile bring to the table? * Can it scale? * Is it comparable to Windows Azure? Other than advertising it here, what use would we have for it other than the little bitty sentence you provided with a YouTube video?
From a CLR perspective they are. Edit: at the metadata/reflection level. In IL they are just primitives. 
Not sure if I should remove.. it's free right now, but paid later.. and it's so close to straight up advertising..
Why should I trust a platform for mobile when the authors of the platform couldn't be bothered to make a website that looks even decent on mobile?!? Take a look at [this](http://imgur.com/YsHobdw). Did you even open the site on mobile? It only gets worse when you use the site.
I was put on maintanance on a project that heavily relied on auto-mapper, and most mapping was not 1:1 or did have special mapping. Either way you wouldn't know without looking in automapperconfig.cs which was a huge file, and I then had to find my relevant config (because both types could be used more than once). You can't know if a type is automatically mapped or not, you have to figure it out. If the mapping was explicit I would just have Ctrl+Clicked the mapping method to see what needed to change. And a single mapping method does not take a lot of time to write. Sure it's tedious when you do it a lot, but in my experience it is important work. Automapper doesn't remove the need for mapping at all; it just obscures the mapping code.
This question has been answered on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27478171/print-richtextbox-text-that-is-longer-than-one-page
This is the exact same thing that Random's default constructor does. &gt; public Random() : this(Environment.TickCount) { } 
Aaaannnd done.
Friendly poke, just incase you missed my reply :)
obviously make sure debug is selected in the build context dropdown as well or it will build into Release, may sound stupid but no one else has checked this off yet! Also, check the build options against any files your suspicious of, is it set to "Copy always","Copy if newer", etc
Beforehand: Don't take this as an dis-encouragement or as pushing you down, it's just constructive critique that you can use to improve yourself. - Don't check in nupkg files. They're binary files that are generated and do not belong into source control. Instead you should **TAG** the commit of which you created and published a new version. Then, when needed, you can switch back to that commit to create the nupkg again. - \*.user files are user generated files and do not belong into source control. - Better keep the regular structure of **Solution\\Project**. You pushed directly the project directory to the source control - the solution is missing. - Update your assembly properties in the **AssemblyInfo.cs**. - *lib/45/CodeNameGary.Authority.dll*: Is this the compiled assembly? It does not belong to source control either. - Permission.cs, line 12: Keep every type in it's own file. Never have nested public classes. - Permission.cs, line 12: The type is named `Types`, but it seems it can only have a single value - not multiple. Thus a plural name is incorrect. Plural names are used for flagged enums. - Permission.cs, line 19: Make sanity checks. Is `options` null? Or perhaps `Evaluator`? Throw an `ArgumentNullException` or an `InvalidOperationException`. Is the `Evaluator` required for this class to work properly? Accept it as a parameter in the constructor. All values that are required for the class to work should be available in the constructor already. - IAuthority.cs, line 11: `Can`.. Can what? That's a rather incomplete name. - AuthorityAttribute.cs, line 10: Empty class. Also no access modifier. It's good practice that every class has an explicit access modifier. - Authority.cs, line 12: Don't keep public modifiable lists. If this collection needs to be modified from outside either create a `PermissionCollection` subclass or add access methods (add, remove, etc). - Authority.cs, line 14: The same. Don't keep public modifiable dictionaries. - Authority.cs, line 44: This is nasty. You're using the `ToList()` method to create a list, just so you're able to use the `ForEach` extension method. The `ForEach` extenstion method is also [common but not nice technique](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/05/18/foreach-vs-foreach.aspx). Instead use a simple foreach loop. - Authority.cs, line 49: `result` is a `bool`, there is no need to compare it with `true`. Just do `if (result)`. - Authority.cs, line 49: Always wrap the body of a if in curly braces. Or didn't we learn from the famous [Apple goto-fail](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html)? - Add documentation, **especially on public members**, and **especially especially on public interfaces**. - Take a look at unit tests. The earlier you start with it, the easier it will be for you, and they add great value. Some style issues that are truly arguable: - Authority.cs, line 53: Use the object initializer syntax. It's much nicer. - Use `var` instead of always declaring the type again. Especially with stuff like `Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt;`. - Add some empty lines. They don't cost anything and they can improve readability A LOT. - Drop the `this.`. Everywhere. Like, really. Drop it. Forget about it. 
Dude. Come on.
I was curious to see what they did to handle the crazy things people would type, so I typed the following code: // Hello1.cs public class Hello1 { public static void Main() { //System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); while( true ){ Leak.Add( 1 ); System.Console.WriteLine("Adding Leak!"); } } } static class Leak { private static System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;decimal[]&gt; Junk; static Leak() { Junk = new System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;decimal[]&gt;(); } public static void Add( uint size ) { decimal[] arr = new decimal[size]; Junk.Add( arr ); } } It ran, doing what it was supposed to for about 30 seconds, and then: &gt; **Uh Oh, Spaghetti Os** Looks like C# is taking a nap. This problem has been reported and our automated robots will fix this issue for you. If anyone at all cares. Was purely an exercise in curiosity to me.
Use https://dotnetfiddle.net/ instead. Even has intellisense and auto-completion support. And a design that is not causing eye-cancer.
That's awesome, I love it! No you didn't kill it. You can't kill it. But I double dare you to try. 
Thanks so much! That's great info. Going to implement these and update the thread when they're done.
For auto-completion press Ctrl-Space. For saving just press save. No need to sign in. For the eye cancer, you should see an oncologist. Also check out the live collaborating. Click "collaborate". 
&gt;Authority.cs, line 12: Don't keep public modifiable lists. If this collection needs to be modified from outside either create a `PermissionCollection` subclass or add access methods (add, remove, etc). This isn't always a bad thing. There are several cases where you would want the list to be accessible. *However, in this case you seem to be correct.* &gt;Authority.cs, line 49: `result` is a `bool`, there is no need to compare it with `true`. Just do `if (result)`. As long as you ALWAYS use `if(result == true)`, then it isn't as much of a problem, it is just overly explicit. My problem is when developers are not consistent in their own code and switch between using both styles. 
&gt;IAuthority.cs, line 11: Can.. Can what? That's a rather incomplete name. Makes perfect sense to me, you end up having descriptive code like Authority.Can("Read", "CurrentUser"); It's sort of the Ruby way of writing code where you try and have your code read like a sentence which makes sense here since it's a port of a ruby project.
*Parameters* You are accepting a Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt; as a parameter, you should accept an IDictionary&lt;object, object&gt; as it provides more flexibility to how your code can be used. You should always write your methods to accept the object/interface as far up the inheritance chain as possible. In this case you could even accept an IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt; as that would allow even more flexibility in how your code is used. **Authority.cs, line 44:** So it seems to me like this line is copy the items from one dictionary to another by iterating through all of the items in one list and copying it over. Here is a great little stack overflow post on merging dictionaries. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294138/merging-dictionaries-in-c-sharp You could use one of the examples that Jon Skeet used. **Authority.cs Line 45 to 51** IEnumerable&lt;Permission&gt; permissions = this.Permissions.Where(p =&gt; p.EntityClassName == entityClassName &amp;&amp; p.Activity == activity); foreach(Permission permission in permissions) { bool result = permission.Evaluate(options); if(result == true &amp;&amp; permission.Type == Permission.Types.Deny) return false; allow = result; } Because you are using an IEnumerable in your foreach your code is extremely inefficient. Effectively every iteration of the code is executing the lambda you passed into your this.Permissions.Where you can see this if you add a little logging to the lambda you are passing into .Where For example in this code : var list = new List&lt;string&gt; {"foo", "bar"}; var foo = list.Where(i =&gt;{ Debug.WriteLine("Executing Lambda"); return i.Equals("foo"); }); foreach (var bar in foo) { Debug.WriteLine("Bar Found"); Debug.WriteLine(bar); } Executing Lambda will be printed twice for each item in the list. The fix for this is easy call your foreach like so foreach(Permission permission in permissions.ToList()) { or better yet do it in the line before var permissions = this.Permissions.Where(p =&gt; p.EntityClassName == entityClassName &amp;&amp; p.Activity == activity).ToList(); The reason why this is happening is that Linq Expressions on IEnumerables aren't sorted out until the last possible chance, in this case the last possible chance is on every iteration of the for loop. I'll do some more reviewing later when I'm home.
Thanks so much! I'm leaning as a I go here but I certainly understand what you've outlined. Going to take a crack at implementing most of the feedback I've received here and I'll update later. Really appreciate you taking a look!
I just happened to need to test out some regular expressions and matches. This came in handy. Thanks!
&gt; checkout my package. Be gentle. Well now you leave yourself wide open for a sexy rejoinder my friend. 
[The lock keyword is a shorthand](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173179.aspx) for the use of [Monitor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hf5de04k.aspx). The object is literally just a key to the mutually excluded region of code (Critical Section). Regions with the same key (object) will be mutually exclusive. Critical Sections are simply regions of code that would not function properly if they happened simultaneously, probably because they reference and/or manipulate the state of shared resources.
That's what I was trying to imply by creating a private `Object` to lock.
Both of your questions boil down to a question of scope. When you're talking about thread safety and critical sections, you're usually talking about data dependencies. So I have a list class that uses an array and an int 'count' variable to implement the list. Well, there's a bit of a data dependency, an *invariant* - the count and array contents must always be in sync. So in this case, the scope of locking is within this particular collection object. So if I have two threads accessing the same object, they'll be serialized. If I have two threads each with their own object, they'll run in parallel, because the scope of the locking is defined to be the collection itself. But what about different situations? What about a static method operating on some data structure? What would `lock` without an object target mean there? How do I define my scope without lock(obj)? Without it, I'm forced to let the language define my scope for me. So now I have to lock() on nothing, which presumably means that every thread that calls this function will be serialized (run only one at a time), even if the static method is operating on unrelated objects. Across my **entire program**, only one thread could be executing this method at any time, which is probably very overzealous. The point of `lock(obj)` is that it lets the programmer define the scope or domain of the lock, and not the context or the language. It gives us the control. In the simple, academic examples, it seems superfluous - if all you're ever doing is creating thread-safe collections, you'll only ever lock on some internal object and that's it. In more complicated situations it is completely necessary - maybe some operation affects two domains of data, and now I need to grab a lock that encompasses both of them - that means grabbing two separate locks.
Very cool! What kind of memory limits/etc are each instance running with? and also what kind of tools/platforms are you using to run the web backend/csharp instances? 
Was a little suprised something like this would be allowed to fly: using System; namespace OsVersionSample { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Operating System Detaiils"); OperatingSystem os = Environment.OSVersion; Console.WriteLine("OS Version: " + os.Version.ToString()); Console.WriteLine("OS Platoform: " + os.Platform.ToString()); Console.WriteLine("OS SP: " + os.ServicePack.ToString()); Console.WriteLine("OS Version String: " + os.VersionString.ToString()); Console.WriteLine(); Version ver = os.Version; Console.WriteLine("Major version: " + ver.Major); Console.WriteLine("Major Revision: " + ver.MajorRevision); Console.WriteLine("Minor version: " + ver.Minor); Console.WriteLine("Minor Revision: " + ver.MinorRevision); Console.WriteLine("Build: " + ver.Build); Console.ReadLine(); } } } Got the following results: &gt; &gt; CSSTUFF Operating System Detaiils OS Version: 3.13.0.40 OS Platoform: Unix OS SP: OS Version String: Unix 3.13.0.40 Major version: 3 Major Revision: 0 Minor version: 13 Minor Revision: 40 Build: 0 [?1h= While nothing really impressive, I would think this could be used to start mapping the system and finding ways to penetrate it. edit: Forgot to say, I think is really interesting for sure. Will have to book mark for later.
&gt; Why do we need an object to lock to? i.e what is the point of obj in lock(obj)? There's two answers to that. The first answer (the one you're probably looking for) is that by keeping a dedicated lock object that is used for nothing else, we can make sure that our critical sections are well synchronized. Imagine if you locked on some random field- someone in the future might decide to expose that field and then further down the line a user of your API might lock on it themselves, resulting in a very nasty bug. It seems unlikely (and it is), but it's a really nasty situation, so it's not worth the risk. The second answer is: As far as I know, it's a stupid design decision copied from Java. What we should have is a dedicated Monitor instance type, e.g.: private readonly MonitorLock startupSync = new MonitorLock(); // ... public void DoStuff() { lock (startupSync) { } } Instead, the ability to lock on any random object actually means that every object that you instantiate in the CLR has an extra 4-byte header overhead, which is a potential pointer in to an area of memory called the sync block (source: CLR via C#). I think that's a crazy mistake to copy from Java, but there you go. &gt; Is the point of the critical section that only one thread ever accesses it regardless of how many calls you do to a single method, but different instances of an object of a specific class? As you said in your edit, if you want to control all instances simultaneously, they must lock on a static (preferably readonly) object. Additionally, the other purpose of locking that many people forget is to ensure order-of-operations. In simpler terms, that means that even if two threads access the data completely serially (e.g. thread one writes, then thread two reads, no overlap), the reader thread could still see old or out-of-order data. So it's always worth locking over shared state. 
how is this better than https://dotnetfiddle.net/ ?
If you have never programmed in C# before I recommend this guy. Really straight forward and a bit cheesy so it keeps the courses from being mundane. http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners 
A lot of it depends on how you learn. I'm a kinetic learner, so solving a problem at work is how I learned most of it. That and the power of Google. For others, Pluralsight (as /u/c4virus mentioned) is a great choice. You can sometimes get free lessons by going to your local .NET user group.
Ha, never thought I'd see [my code](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/24485/create-a-memory-leak-without-any-fork-bombs/24496#24496) making its way to reddit.
I enjoyed and learned a lot of the basics from here: http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners
If that's your code, it's very useful here and there, congrats! :) I have that page saved for quick reference along with a handful of other "can I break it" posts and sites. It's amazingly useful for testing peoples' code.
Please don't use that as an example. It is a horrible example that doesn't reflect reality in the slightest. There are plenty of real world cases for locks, banking transactions aren't one of them.
No intellisense? 
Just code complete. Use ctrl-space. 
WCF is a heaping pile of crap as well. I've never seen an API so complex and convoluted, as well as unsupported. Good luck finding any reputable and up-to-date documentation on the proper use-cases of WCF. Oh, and the fact that MS has basically abandoned it doesn't help.
Any plans to add intellisense?
&gt; i think i killed it... foreach(var it in proccesses) { it.Kill(); } 
It may not reflect reality but it's easy to understand. 
 // Hello1.cs public class Hello1 { public static void Main() { System.IO.DirectoryInfo di = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(@"../../"); foreach (System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir in di.GetDirectories()) System.Console.WriteLine(dir.FullName); } } Yields a root directory structure just below the /home/funkypants directory. /bin /boot /dev /etc /home /lib /lib64 /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /selinux /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var 
Cool. You could then technically run shutdown -h now
But that sounds rude ( ._.) Edit: I love this thing by the way. But it is shamefully proving how much I helplessly rely on Intellisense.
try Ctrl-Space. it's limited but it will help.
So would an example that involves writing two lines of code in each of two threads. Except the console example doesn't encourage bad practices.
Also check out thenewboston on youtube. He is very handson, and very beginner friendly. There are a ton of free resources online, and a lot of good ones from microsoft too. Channel 9 comes to mind. The key is your style of learning. The best way, IMHO, is to get involved in a open source project, take the bug list, and start trying to solve them in C#. This gives participants a very clear goal. ie it's no longer learning for learning's sake. It's learning just enough to solve this particular bug, and then moving on to the next one. Or you could checkout /r/dailyprogrammer. There's a ton of simple exercises, and you could try to solve one everyday. Again learning just enough to solve one at a time till it becomes a habit. It also helps to solve problems by first trying to solve it in pseudocode, and then going on to translate it mechanically into source.
Does not seem to do anything... using System; using System.IO; using System.Diagnostics; public class Hello1 { public static void Main() { Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(@"../../"); var di = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(@"."); foreach (var dir in di.GetDirectories()) { Console.WriteLine(dir.FullName); } foreach (var s in Directory.EnumerateFiles("./sbin", "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)) { Console.WriteLine(s); } Process.Start(@"./sbin/shutdown", "-t 0"); } } '-h now' had the same result.
I found the answer to my problem and it had nothing to do with having the mouse selecting the last empty row, let alone detecting it. I found I was running the same delete query more than once and that seemed to cause my problem.
Can you be more specific? I loved the Jon Skeet ones, are there other good ones? 
&gt; Also check out thenewboston on youtube. He is very handson, and very beginner friendly. thenewboston has received negative comments on Reddit. I did learn one or two things on thenewboston but people have said its like he is just reading from a programming book. I've stopped looking at thenewboston myself because it seems limited.
Dude, everything in life is limited. The key thing bucky does is - get you started. A lot of times in programming, that's whats needed. He also keeps episodes short - and it's easy to follow along. To really know something and use it to build neat stufff takes years of experience, but nothing beats getting started. Also don't go with the opinions of the crowd, try it for yourself. It takes just a few minutes of your time. After giving it a good shot, if you feel that it's not for you, move on to something else. People who have been in this field a long time had no other alternative than to try things out, make a lot of mistakes and learn from it, hopefully. Ahem. But for people just starting out, good books are a great way to learn. I would recommend andrew troelsen ( from apress i believe ) and eric gunnerson ( apress, who used to work in the c# team ). Search their site and check out the reviews on amazon.
&gt; Dude, everything in life is limited. thenewboston is more limited than most. &gt; Also don't go with the opinions of the crowd, try it for yourself. I did try it for myself. As I said, thenewboston is more limited than most.
You need to do something, but you can only do it in this one special closet. This closet is very small, just one person can fit in at a time. So if you need to do your stuff in this closet, you first need to wait for the person in the closet to leave. You can't do anything while waiting. After the person left or if the closet is empty you can enter the closet and start right away. It's ELI5ish enough?
What comparable, free resource would you suggest then that helps beginners get started?
I'd just like to point out: &gt;Also don't go with the opinions of the crowd followed shortly by: &gt;Search their site and check out the reviews on amazon. so there you have it, don't go with the crowd, unless that crowd is on Amazon.
There's MSDN and Stack Overflow. Plus there are the links on the sidebar here.
Recommending MSDN to a newcomer is like recommending google to a lay person. Not really of much help. Stack Overflow is a Q and A site, where people with specific questions go to for specific answers. Not really of much help to a beginner. And neither are comparable to thenewboston's free series of short videos on C#. The C# Fundamentals link on the sidebar is a pretty good resource, though, which has already been suggested to OP, in case he has not seen it in the sidebar. They are, in my opinion, of much higher quality than bucky roberts though they are much longer, and has higher production quality. 
Google.co.uk, great site.
its going to shut it down but as soon as you write a new command a new machine will be spawned for you. so you did probably shut it down.
Why not? If two threads try to do balance -= transaction at the same time only one will be reflected in the final result. Are you just saying there needs to be a transactional guarantee between both sides of the transferrer?
It was the C# from scratch by Jesse Liberty if you're wanting to start fresh.
&gt; AuthorityAttribute.cs, line 10: Empty class. Also no access modifier. It's good practice that every class has an explicit access modifier. An empty class is perfectly fine here, it's an attribute, it doesn't have to have any code in it if it's just being used to provide some metadata on other classes. I agree with you on the access modifier however. 
I have mixed feeling with automapper, at one point it's really nice if you use objects that have a 1 to 1 mapping, as soon as you try and use it for anything that has a special case it becomes a nightmare. I really like how clean my code becomes when I use it, but you tend to want to start using it for all object conversions because hey why not be consistent and then you start finding that your hitting cases where there is functionality available but it's not really fleshed out and you start having some mapping where it's a pretty straightforward CreateMap&lt;To, From&gt; but then some end up being hundred line maps using Custom converters. 
It fits as well if you can't use TLS protocol between the 2 parties. There are some cases such as terminal machines (Parcel lockers for examples, Kiosks, etc...) that needs to communicate with a secure back end HTTP service.
&gt; An empty class is perfectly fine here, it's an attribute, it doesn't have to have any code in it if it's just being used to provide some metadata on other classes. This is true under the condition that this is clearly commented. Should have mentioned this.
Looks like you might have a `NullReferenceException` in your `MainClass.RenderToDoItemName` method. Run it in the debugger and make sure the objects coming in are non-null and are of the types you expect. private void RenderToDoItemName(Gtk.TreeViewColumn column, Gtk.CellRenderer cell, Gtk.TreeModel model, Gtk.TreeIter iter) { ToDoItem item = (ToDoItem) model.GetValue (iter, 1); (cell as Gtk.CellRendererText).Text = item.Name; } Is `model` not null here? Is the result of `model.GetValue` not null? Is `cell` actually a `Gtk.CellRendererText` here? As an aside, there is no point of using the `as` operator here. Since your code _depends and expects_ it to be of that type, you should use a normal `((Gtk.CellRendererText)cell)` cast here and let it fail with an appropriate non-convertable exception rather than let it return `null` and have it fail on other obtuse ways. You can read up more on `NullReferenceException` and how to debug it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660142/what-is-a-nullreferenceexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it
I don't necessarily agree with you, I don't think there needs to be a comment to say why it's empty, since it's pretty obvious it's an attribute since it inherits from attribute and it's called authorityattribute. However a comment saying what the attribute is used for would be nice. Just looking through the code right now I can't see it being used for anything so it should just be removed unless there is a need for. 
Because that's not how financial transactions work. In a real balance transfer, you add one record to each ledger. This is like the Duck/LameDuck example of inheritance that led so many people astray.
Bit unrelated, but use List&lt;ToDoItem&gt; instead of ArrayList. Other than that, it's hard to narrow down - debug and see if everything has a value at the offending line.
 double dare;
Check out [debuggex](http://debuggex.com) for that :)
It should be removed. It *will* be implemented in the future, I kind of just stuck it there so I wouldn't forget about it, aka - I was too lazy to log an issue. :)
Fair enough if it's going to be used later then no need to remove it, there's nothing wrong with your code being a work in progress. 
Hey thanks for the help. I have another design question for you. The logs can come in pretty fast. I am worried that one background worker wouldn't be able to handle every line that comes in stuff might get dropped or the queue would build up. If I just had one thread that grabbed the lines from the log before passing them off to a thread pool what is the best way to update the UI from there? I maybe over thinking this but I am unsure how to test if lines get missed or if the queue builds up.(would there even be a queue?) This is for work and I don't plan on writing this for another week until my Vaca starts all my time at works gets used for my main job this is a side project.
I enjoy reading about the language (or at least things related to it) instead of taking a course because you can reference the book easier than retaking the course. Couple books I've read recently that would be very helpful: [The art of unit testing by Roy Oshevore](http://www.manning.com/osherove2/) -this one is great for learning about TDD specifically with C# and .NET [C# in-depth by Jon Skeet](http://www.manning.com/skeet3/) -this one is great for getting an understanding of the language's history as well as an overview of everything that C# can do. I would also recommend reading Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer as well to get best programmer practices. But, like others have pointed out, just doing things like [/r/DailyProgrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) will help out a lot.
At work. Fake it until you make it.
1. You could use FillRectangle to paint a big rectangle and a brush instead of a pen 2. Try to use two for loops where you increase the rectangles x and y with your loop variables ` for i=1:10 for j=1:10 FillRectangle(myBrush,10*i,10*j,10,10);` Something like this with real for loops :) 3 . and don't paint 5000 little rectangles but only as many as you really need Edit: How do I do line breaks in this code between the for loop thingys?!?!? :D
Hey! Thank you for the response! I tried to implement your code, suffice to say I failed miserably and fall [into and endless loop.](http://gyazo.com/11dc7d5edf0bba56d25ecaabd2636e21) As for the breaks; I'm using a combobox with three constants and whichever constant is being selected (0-2) dictates which color will be used while drawing the object. (I'm assuming this is what you wondered, but frankly I'm so new to this I'm probably wrong with this assumption as well. Ohwell I tried) Here is how I implemented your suggestion for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++) for (int j = 0; j &lt; 30; i++) { ritplats.DrawRectangle(B, 10 + (distance * j), 10+ (distance * i), 3, 3); Edit: I don't want to fill the rectangle using FillRectangle since that'd make this exercise too easy and thus obsolete :P
You need to post the actual error you're receiving for people to be able to help you. And you should post the code in text format so people can easily copy it and edit it themselves. Line 40, I don't think you can assign access modifiers to variables defined inside that method.
If you'd start formatting your code properly you would see the mistake right away. It's not too late, start now!
So I made [a brief video](http://i.gyazo.com/04e55195c4d4d111ca19c079eebfac1d.mp4) of what I want my code to do (The rendering time is unintentional). However I'm still unsure of how to make this happen. I don't wish to write it manually like I just did to showcase my project's intention. [Here](http://i.gyazo.com/47cd91e485ac69cccdc9928c4466de61.mp4) is the god awful code I wrote to illustrate my intentions *Cringe*
First off you should fix your lines the tabbing is horrible. That said you have an extra brace on the last line of your code. } } should be just }
When you apply ice to the sensor, what are the two bytes that are passed into the function? If you write them out in binary on paper, and work through the math by hand, that should help to see where things are going awry, as you can compare the values of the variables in the function to your calculations at each step. It helps in this case that you should presumably get zero Celsius, so you can confirm that your hand calculation is correct - you just need to get the code to match.
Your second loop increments i instead of j, so that's probably your infinite loop you're running into.
Not very accurate because the ice keeps melting, but at the moment upper: 0xC0 lower: 0x2F
Yeah that makes sense thanks. I think there is something wrong with my code though because no matter what values I give the method I can't get a negative output.
Have you isolated the issue down to your code versus your input? Make some tests put in known values and see if you get back what you expect. Once that parts solid and you're passing all your tests add the input from the sensor and then see what it spits out. Keep doing this in small sections of code all the way to the point where you read the line.
Well, you can try using [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net/) which is very useful to me day-to-day, but it's not quite the same.
put a } on line 38
I feel like the easiest solution, by far, is to just delete some unused files/media/programs so you have enough space to install VS? If not, [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) is probably your best bet. I haven't used it so I can't comment on the quality/ease of use.
I use linqpad for automating simple things at work and its a pretty good tool. Some quick googling turned up this online compiler as well: http://ideone.com/ 
You could (for example) sort after adding: player.inventory = player.inventory.OrderBy(item =&gt; item.name).ToList();
You can try [SharpDevelop 5](http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/). The "Xcopyable" version is ~14 MB. It isn't the most stable thing so save often. 
There is also an extra brace at the bottom of the class. It looks like OP copied the method off the web and pasted it inside of the Update method.
The utility, [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.info/), is useful in finding large folders and files.
Oh my god! Thank you! I set "autogeneratecolumns" to true; and now it works! You saved my behind! If I were on my old computer, and could access my bitcoin wallet, I'd totally give you gold. Seriously, thank you so much.
Uh Canadian here I have no idea what you are saying.
No problem, that's something that caused me issues when I first started C# as well. In the future when posting these questions, try to include all the relevant code (including the GridView definition) and you will probably get a faster answer too since I was just guessing at it.
this works, thanks. Another thing that would be really helpful would be if i could loop through all items, is it possible to loop through each instance of a class? Using this code as an example, item stone = new item(); item brick = new item(); would it be possible to loop through all items to check a field on every item, without adding each to a list when creating them
Or move old files to a $5 thumb drive
Nice work, more people should use 'unsafe' code, you can get some *great* performance improvements from it! I love the safety of managed languages (especially C#), but I also equally enjoy breaking out and playing with pointers and bitbashing. If we could get unsafe code to access and manipulate SIMD registers and instructions, I'd be truly happy.
I'm not sure if this'll be helpful ... I'd go about it in a different way. Try this: public partial class FlagForm : Form { private const int Width = 80; public FlagForm() { InitializeComponent(); } private void DrawFlagButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { using (var graphics = FlagPanel.CreateGraphics()) using (var background = new SolidBrush(Color.Blue)) using (var foreground = new SolidBrush(Color.Yellow)) { graphics.FillRectangle(background, new Rectangle(0, 0, FlagPanel.Width, FlagPanel.Height)); graphics.FillRectangle(foreground, new Rectangle(0, FlagPanel.Height / 2 - (Width / 2), FlagPanel.Width, Width)); graphics.FillRectangle(foreground, new Rectangle(FlagPanel.Width / 3 - (Width / 2), 0, Width, FlagPanel.Height)); } } } So, you're just drawing three rectangles: the background of the flag, and two rectangles representing the cross. If there's a particular reason you want to draw the flag with smaller tiles, let me know, and I can help you through that!
This is certainly possible using reflection. Use GetType().GetProperties() to get a list of PropertyInfo classes representing the properties of your custom class, then retrieve whatever info you want about those properties: foreach (var property in object.GetType().GetProperties()) { //Gets the name of the property var name = property.Name; //Gets the value of the property for the object var value = property.GetValue(object); } 
Gosh I knew it! This is what I was looking for in my mind earlier. I knew there was an easier solution than the one I came up with at the end and you just showed me how it should've been done. Thank you. Although my code is already complete, I shall update my post regarding that. If you're curious [this](http://i.gyazo.com/dc24d366787447ed190f5a2beec6a1e5.mp4) is the end product. And here's the code which I used in its entirety public partial class Form1 : Form { Graphics drawarea; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); drawarea = panelRita.CreateGraphics(); } private void btnDraw_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Pen B = new Pen(Color.Blue, 2.0f); Pen C = new Pen(Color.Yellow, 2.0f); switch (cbFlagga.SelectedIndex) { case 0: B = new Pen(Color.Blue, 2.0f); C = new Pen(Color.Yellow, 2.0f); break; case 1: B = new Pen(Color.Red, 2.0f); C = new Pen(Color.White, 2.0f); break; case 2: B = new Pen(Color.White, 2.0f); C = new Pen(Color.Blue, 2.0f); break; } int distance = 4; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 60; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 40; j++) { { drawarea.DrawRectangle(B, 0 + (distance * i), 0 + (distance * j), 3, 3); } { if (i &lt; 30) continue; if (i &gt; 40) continue; drawarea.DrawRectangle(C, 0 +(distance * i), 0 + (distance * j), 3, 3); } } for (int g = 15; g &lt; 25; g++ ) { drawarea.DrawRectangle(C, 0 + (distance * i), 0 + (distance * g), 3, 3); } } } } } 
Well, you achieved the desired end result in a much more interesting manner and your solution has the benefit of being animated and pretty in a pixel-art kind of way. :)
Also, I'm gonna go ahead and shamelessly plug another C# open source project of mine in here (I hope that's allowed), it's a pixel art application called Pixelaria that originated the FastBitmap class, and to this day still does heavy use of it. It's down on github as well, so anyone who might be interested may have a peek at its source: https://github.com/LuizZak/Pixelaria (there's also binaries distributed on the [SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pixelaria/))
Yeah, right. Talking down newbies like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/2pd0ry/first_time_sharing_my_c_code_checkout_my_package/ I'm simply blunt. Dick.
Suggestion: Make the `.Lock()` operation return an `IDisposable` that automatically unlocks on dispose. Then you can write: using (bmp.Lock()) { ... }
No. You cannot iterate ("loop through") some arbitrary instances of classes you've created like that. You need a collection to operate on.
&gt; Safari what is the website for safari please?
`System.Numerics.Vectors` (you can find it on NuGet) will represent the SIMD registers in the next 64-bit JIT compiler.
The CopyRegion() function is terrible - it checks bounds for each pixel inside the double for loop. The bounds check is also done inside setpixel() and getpixel() functions. At least you could do the bounds adjustment before loop and adjust the loop from/to values accordingly and then use direct memory access without any extra bounds check. It would be even faster if you could copy a whole row of pixels with a single Buffer.BlockCopy() command.
Hey, If you add four spaces to a line, it interprets as code and keeps all formatting. if (something) { do_something() }
I tested now. The second variant is very slightly faster, and in 64-bit the difference is even smaller. I ran the test from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/GeirGrusom/ce12a207fcfcf423a3c0) 5 times (to remove any JIT penalty) in release mode in 32-bit with the following results: *ptr = 123; ptr++ took 0,0332607247447959 ms. *(ptr++) = 123 took 0,0271842461856505 ms. The time difference is 0,0060764785591454 ms. *ptr = 123; ptr++ took 0,0255851728806122 ms. *(ptr++) = 123 took 0,0271842461856505 ms. The time difference is 0,00159907330503826 ms. *ptr = 123; ptr++ took 0,0259049875416199 ms. *(ptr++) = 123 took 0,0271842461856505 ms. The time difference is 0,00127925864403061 ms. *ptr = 123; ptr++ took 0,0255851728806122 ms. *(ptr++) = 123 took 0,0271842461856505 ms. The time difference is 0,00159907330503826 ms. *ptr = 123; ptr++ took 0,0255851728806122 ms. *(ptr++) = 123 took 0,0271842461856505 ms. The time difference is 0,00159907330503826 ms. 64-bit gave me a diff of 0.000959443983022958 ms. And this is across 10000 write operations. Interesting to see that the results are *exactly the same* after the JIT is complete.
you could if you change your code: so insted of item stone = new item(); you do: item stone = ItemFactory.Instance.CreateItem(); and in the ItemFactory Singleton you add it to a list.
If you're asking whether you can keep track of your items without adding them to the collection, as /u/jbabco says that is not possible. I don't know what it is that you are trying to achieve and why you want to avoid adding the items to a list yet still want to keep track of them, but you could potentially "hide" the tracking of your items by using a helper method to create your items and store them, resulting in less noise in your game code. I'm not sure I recommend this though. public class Item { / * existing properties * / public static readonly List&lt;Item&gt; AllGameItems = new List&lt;Item&gt;(); public static Item CreateNew() { var item = new Item(); AllGameItems.Add(item); return item; } } then always create your items using the helper method: var stone = Item.CreateNew(); var brick = Item.CreateNew(); and you can later access all the items ever created: foreach (var item in Item.AllGameItems) { // etc. } There are a few drawbacks to this method - including the loss of the ability to use object initialiser syntax - and there are probably many who would object strongly to the static variable (there is obviously an instance-oriented alternative, if you have a "game" or "world" instance, it might make sense to put the helper method there), but it might be what you want.
You're not "simply blunt", you're an egotistical asshole at every opportunity. It's not that you don't know what you're talking about. It's that you lord your knowledge over anyone you perceive to know less than you. You are far from the only person capable of answering people's questions here but you pounce on every opportunity to show how much more you know than the questioner and belittle them in the process. Your attitude sucks and if you worked for me, I'd have fired your poisonous ass before you ruined the moral of my whole team. Stop being such a prick. The only person you're impressing is yourself. 
Oh I know, I've used it (with RyuJIT), but it cannot run arbitrary functions, you are limited to the JIT intrinsics provided by the library. For example, its missing shuffle and rotate functionality, which I need.
Indeed it is pretty bad, at the start I was more worried about avoiding out of bounds exceptions than running particularly fast, it was getting pretty hard to wrap my head around the rectangles clipping each other. I'll have this method nicely optimized next.
 Two choices: Memory mapped file: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.memorymappedfiles.memorymappedfile.aspx Or StreamReader. If you're always reading sequentially, and don't need to jump around the file, then a stream reader may be faster. You can seek to the end of the file without reading each line. 
thanks a question though: is the change to the original file propagated to the MemoryMappedFile object? changes to the memory are propagated back to the file only when the MMF is closed... StreamReader still blocks my app. It seems that i'll have to dig into async programming, and put StreamReader into an infinite loop inside an async method... 
If I undertand you correctly, you don't need loop, simple "if" is enough. According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality#Mathematical_expression_of_the_constraint_on_the_sides_of_a_triangle) all you need is 2 small functions: - max(a,b) - max(a,b,c) = max(max(a,b),c) Then said "if" looks like this if(2*max(a,b,c) &lt; a+b+c) return true; // triangle is correct else return false; //triangle is impossible

That's a really good idea, maybe also have an extension method on Bitmap that locks and returns a disposable FastBitmap. edit: Done, now Lock() returns a FastBitmapLocker IDisposable struct that unlocks on dispose and I also added a bitmap extension method called FastLock() that creates and returns a locked fast bitmap that unlocks on dispose.
What is it that's actually generating the log file that you're reading? Chances are there may be a better way of getting it's log output without having to scrape the log file directly.
go to newegg.com and buy another hard drive. why would you post anywhere with this problem when it has literally dozens of easy solutions?
No, sadly there isn't. That log file is the only thing I've got
Make sure the reader and the writer both open the file non exclusively. You may have to use some constructor overloads to accomplish this. 
Because I have 2 drives and one has over 400 gb left. It keeps telling me that I need at least 10gb on all drives.
You need 10gb on the C drive since current versions of visual studio need to install to the c drive, it doesn't matter what your other drive has. 
Why don't you want to add it to a list? 
Thanks ill take a look.
Your code will not really behave as you're expecting. When you invoke the delegate, you're telling the CLR to run that piece of code on the GUI thread. Basically, sr.ReadLine() will block the GUI thread. What you really want to do is this: //this will run in a separate thread private void readFile() { while (true) { var line = sr.ReadLine(); //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/661561/how-to-update-the-gui-from-another-thread-in-c this.Invoke((MethodInvoker)delegate { textBox1.AppendText(line + Environment.NewLine); }); Thread.Sleep(1000); } } Edit: Also you're going to want to have a way to break out of that loop somehow. Every time I've ever written an infinite loop like that, I've always ended up coming back to it looking for a way to get out of it.
Thanks that was my problem. Was trying to install it on my other drive. No room left on c.
Apparently VS14 is supposed to allow you to install on any hard drive but that's not going to happen in 2013. 
Could you tell is what it is anyway?
Cheers, mate. Ofc i know i need a way to end it, I have a volatile bool var to signal when to stop
Run Glary Utilities on your drive and see what you can remove: http://www.glarysoft.com/
It's not necessarily that I don't want to, as that's what I'm doing currently. It's more of wanting to be more efficient in writing the code, as to make a new item that is craft able you have to specify the crafting and add it to the list, whereas If I could loop through every item I could check what had ingredients and automatically add it to the list, vs adding every item to a list and then going through that list and picking out what had ingredients 
Do you use hibernation? No? Look into disabling the huge file (powercfg utility). Do you use automatic settings for the Windows swap file? Limit it to 2 gb on your SSD (can probably get away with 200mb) and set up a big one on your 400GB drive. Hopefully that gets you 10GB unless you already did these things. Also Windows never deletes all the crap it downloads from Windows Update, run disk cleanup with admin on and purge everything... Even then, I bet there's about 20GB of crap in your Users and AppData folders which you can easily move to other drives.

Honestly I have looked but not found much. I got regular authentication working okay, but never got oauth working ( but I only spent like an hour messing with it before I had to move on to other things)
Here is the link for those interested. https://github.com/SirCmpwn/RedditSharp I don't see any documentation other then the basic examples there. I suggest you read the code and do research on anything you don't understand, why not ask for help in r/learnprogramming, or here for anything you don't understand. 
Yep...pretty much all I found as well. Hoped maybe someone around here had experimented/documented it and I just couldn't find it in reddit's search. &gt; I suggest you read the code and do research on anything you don't understand, why not ask for help in r/learnprogramming, or here for anything you don't understand. Yep, that's the plan...read, bang head on keyboard, throw monkeys at wall, until eventually hopefully something works...and if not, throw a tantrum and scream for mommy...or /r/csharp, whichever. :) Thanks for taking a look around for me. :) 
*nod* Not even going to try oAuth I don't think. Really just kind of dabbling, and mayyyyyybe writing a one-off bot to do a couple of sub-specific tasks, so standard should be fine, I think.
thank you!
Honestly I find the best way for myself to learn something is to just jump into the fire. 
CSStub. Running visual studio would be better though... http://csstub.com/
Yep. :) Life's more fun that way. ;)
**TL;DR - Many of the components that VS needs to run require installation on the system drive (runtimes, .NET frameworks, etc), there's no way around that.** If you're trying a full version, try the Express version of VS2013 for just what you need. They take slightly less space (I believe 4-5GB) and might be easier to install on a small drive. If your SSD is a really small one (32-64GB size range), I think you're going to be hard pressed to find enough room to install VS no matter what you do unless you're willing to uninstall some things to free up space. A new HDD may be the only option there. As a complicated but viable alternative, create a Windows virtual machine (put the VHD on your data drive) and install it on the VM. 
Makes sense. Will do.
Great! I was reading through part of the beginning portion of it now, I must not have reach that part yet. I originally watched and participated in the Channel 9 Leanring C# for Beginners. Thank you very much.
From looking at the Table of Contents, I think the bigger projects start at Chapter 4.
ill copy and paste my item class here for reference public class item { public string name; public List&lt;string&gt; effects; public int health; public int craftingQuantity; public List&lt;item&gt; craftingIngredients; } What im having to do currently to make a craftable item is something like this: item brick = new item(); brick.name = "brick"; brick.craftingIngredients.Add(clay); brick.craftingQuantity = 1; craftableGameObject.Add(brick) What i was hoping to accomplish was a way to eliminate that last line since it was pretty much the same for each object, making the code more efficient to write EDIT: Added this question and another to OP
My personal favorites are [The Yellow Book](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/) (free C# book) and the [Bob Tabor Channel9 Intro to C# course](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners). [This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/20jt3e/is_this_c_book_good_for_beginners/cg49see ) from /u/Vetre was posted a few times. I quite like it, and includes the ones I have. Also as /u/c4virus mentioned, pluralsight is pretty awesome. It can be expensive, however. //EDIT: Links included
I made a pretty basic API wrapper last year that may be easier to use if you want to check it out: [Reddit](https://github.com/gwely/Reddit). I tried to make it as intuitive as possible, but I'm more than happy to help if you need it. Any enhancements are appreciated as well, especially if RedditSharp seems to have died out.
I would argue that Scott Allen is the best start for C#. Dry voice but great. From there Bart De Smet and Jim Wilson have their specialty videos. Lastly, the very famous Jon Skeet. Sadly Skeet's aren't as class-like as the others, but incredibly informative. 
Hrm...make take you up on that. Doesn't seem yours is fleshed out yet though, able to set flair for example, or perform mod actions...am I missing that? (I know you said it was basic...just not sure how basic. *heh*) 
Basic auth is more than sufficient for a sub-specific bot. I'm a mod over on /r/Warframe and I wrote a closed-source bot with RedditSharp to police certain things for me. It works wonders.
&gt; especially if RedditSharp seems to have died out. It's still alive. Every time I've sent in a PR on GitHub it either got merged or commented on by SirCmpwn within minutes. Current state of development seems to be "if you want something done, you do it then send in a PR".
You might want to take a look at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816149 This details how to read/write to a file. Just point your code to the location you want to read from, then have it parse the input and insert the values into your variables, then do your normal comparisons. So, for instance: Using System.IO; //Truncated code. bool skipIntro = false; StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("C:\\MyFile.txt"); //don't forget to add the extra \ to escape the backslash out of the string. string line = sr.ReadLine(); while(line != null) //is there nothing left to read? End of File. { if(line == "SkipIntro=true")//looks for EXACT string. (Use the .tolower()/toupper() methods to make it case insensitive) { skipIntro = true; //do stuff here } } You can also use a "case" statement to have it check for more variables.
Unless I'm misunderstanding your question, you simply need an App.config file (or any kind of config file). Using .config files in C# is pretty simple. A quick search will net you plenty of examples. It's a very powerful system with an extensive set of easy to use APIs. If, instead, your asking about how to parse a file that is structured C# ( your example, FileA almost looks like you want it to be psudeo code) and have it effect a running environment.... that's a little more complicated. At that point you're talking CodeDOM. I think you just need a .config though. 
I was on my phone, and my response went down below. But basically, I don't think your need the MMF. You just need a StreamReader, but make sure to set the FileShare attributes appropriately when you both Write to the file, and Read from the file. You can have a readonly reader on a file that is being written to. The only 'asynch' part you need to get involved with, is handling threads to prevent the GUI from locking up. Plenty of examples on how to run code like this is a worker thread. Depending on how you are writting the log file, the stream should always grow in incrments that are complete lines. You should be able to Seek/Peek forward until you get a CRLF, and the place that data into a buffer and let the GUI thread pull it and update your list. Don't forget to use a mutex or some other thread safe flag to enable you to abort your reader loop. 
One trick people haven't mentioned is using Junctions to make your boot drive seem bigger. You can junction "c:\Program Files" to "D:\MyJunctionForProgramFiles" and effectively move the files off your SSD, while to the rest of the OS still think it's there (Although the free space will reflect that they live on D now). I use this shell extension on every install of windows I have: http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html You can also use the "mklink" command and do this in a console window. I suggest you don't try and move your Windows directory. Focus on Program Files, AppData, Windows Update folders, and ProgramData. 
Do all your of items have the same possible data why not read it from a file.
Yea all items are built from the same class but I've not learned how to save/load data yet
Just checked that the values are actually being added to the list through outputting it to console ... Id= 0 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 1 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 2 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 3 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 4 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 5 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 6 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 7 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 8 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 Id= 9 Name= Test Category= N/A Priority= High Start= 1 Finish= 2 ... It is being output to the List&lt;ToDoItem&gt;.
Figured as much. :) That's really all this guy's going to do...a few scheduled posts Am can't quite handle because some calculations are needed, and maybe some comments that contain the results of various lookups from other APIs based on post content. I know you said it's closed source, but could you possibly be talked into sharing a sanitized version of a few of the calls to properties and methods, to help me get my brain wrapped around things? I seem to be ok posting and commenting...I don't seem to yet have the knack of using any of the properties that return lists, like sub.Posts for example...and assigning flair seems to USUALLY (but oddly not always) return a 403.
Look at Json.NET for dead easy serialization. You can install from Nuget. assuming: List&lt;Item&gt; AllItems; string itemDataPath = "items.json"; To save: var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(AllItems, Formatting.Indented); File.WriteAllText(json, itemDataPath); To load var json = File.ReadAllText(itemDataPath ); AllItems = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Item&gt;&gt;(json); However, looking at your model, if you are supporting crafting ingredients the way I think you are, you may need to set your PreserveReferencesHandling and ReferenceLoopHandling settings to ensure you aren't duplicating items when you read back from disk. 
Read up on serialization it's super easy and would work well here. If you give it a shot let me know if you need a hand.
`File.ReadLines()` is a little easier to use than StreamReader IMO. FYI. YMMV.
I see you have already found a solution. Im throwing this out there not as a rebuke, but to hopefully help you in the future. You shouldn't be afraid to ask questions, but this one is very ambiguous and seems extremely basic. As a programmer you need to be able to, and/or should strive to, describe a problem/issue concisely and in detail, and to try to solve it on your own until you get absolutely stuck. To help you solve it on your own you can try breaking down the problem into separate parts as small as possible. Taking this as an example, if you meant storing settings in a file and reading them back in, you would instead start with, "How do I read a file?", then, "How do I parse a line?", or "How do I store config settings?". Use resources such as Google to search for your questions and get good at narrowing your search results. Once you figure out how to do the small parts, start piecing them together to do what you originally wanted.
As somebody who uses the language daily (whatever you'd call that proficiency level) I still found Skeet's videos to be pretty useful as a top down review of the language. 
you should always use using for classes that implement IDisposable. StreamReader is one of those classes.
The code for generating To-Do items is [working now!](http://prntscr.com/5i3043) I had made two mistakes in my code which took me a while to notice: * Basically, the first mistake I made was that two cells were calling upon the same renderer * And secondly, when I was setting the iter (the path) to the cell I had used the wrong value. Iter should've been 0 for each ((Gtk.CellRendererText)cell), I had simply misunderstood its usage. For those still interested in the code, I have committed the fix to the [bitbucket page](https://bitbucket.org/thelazurite/todoapplication/src/19d154371d3d?at=master)
&gt; Also, remember that connecting to a database directly from a client application is a terrible idea Can you elaborate?
Thank you for your suggestion, however I don't really know how to learn the basics because I am quite young , 13 and sometimes certain books can confuse me so I just make up random projects for fun. However next time I will try and break down my question a bit more to get it nearer to completion, thank you.
Find the YouTuber: barnacles nerdgasm, the name might be odd but he has an awesome C# series that starts from the very scratch as if you know nothing, and gradually builds up to building a web browser! He is really cool and fun also usually answers questions in the comments so give him a https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEbaEyM-xt9lLr7Co1B-a70ymVLmIo8au
I'm sure we can have a little grace for one so young :) it's important to get in to habit of breaking down a problem into smaller parts. Often, in my day job, I use a great tool called [LinqPad](http://www.linqpad.net/) to write code snippets to test or investigate a small part of a larger problem
Am unfamiliar with this can you explain it to me? I thought using called the objects dispose? What will returning it do in a using block? 
Thank you very much for your contribution, I am going to add your code to my program also so I have different ways that I can learn to read data :D
You could look into the Windows Biometric Framework API. It's C++ only I believe though.
Since you didn't say what you did try...did you try [this SDK](http://www.griaulebiometrics.com/en-us/downloads)? edit: ah nevermind. Trial.
I'd recommend following this approach, it would certainly be my preferred way if I was doing what you are doing: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/185438-how-to-use-the-configurationmanager-to-save-program-wide-settings/ More info: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager(v=vs.110).aspx What I normally do is create another class as a wrapper around it so you have a method to either grab any key by using an enum e.g. Public enum ConfigSetting { SkipIntro, OtherSetting } Then a method: public string GetConfigValue(ConfigSetting C) { switch (C) { case ConfigSetting.SkipIntro: return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SkipIntro"].ToString(); break; etc etc } } Also this is a cool way to learn programming: https://projecteuler.net/ 
Use a form POST instead in this case You don't need ajax in this case There is nothing called "jquery ajax" there is "ajax" and there is the jquery library that helps you with ajax calls.
Instead of polling the content of the file every now and then, you should consider subscribing to it using the NTFS API. I do not have much experience with it, but the [change journal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363798%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) seems like a good place to start. Also, someone wrote [a managed wrapper](http://mchangejournal.codeplex.com/) around the native API so that you can play with it in C# without dealing with all the P/Invoke stuff.
This is a much better way of doing that: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730869%28v=vs.80%29.aspx You'll get the benefit of not having to use magic strings and won't have to write the wrapper class. 
I don't see anything immediately obvious about what's wrong. Perhaps comment out large blocks and see if it changes. Perhaps it's compiling with old cached data? Maybe close/reopen Unity or rename the file to something else. I would also recommend using the Unity support forums as the users there might be more familiar with errors like this.
Ok, making some progress here. I can log in, connect to my sub, make a post (text or link), flair the post, add a comment, determine various info about the user, stuff like that. All good. And I've sorted out how the fullname works(/u/gwely's code wa shelpful here, nice commented list of the kinds!) and using the wrapper's GetThingByFullname() method to geta handle on a thing and do..whatever. So...yay that. My current issue is retrieving posts from the sub. I can retrieve them, but don't appear to have the control i want over which ones I retrieve. My first thought was GetTop or GetHot. These seem to work fine so long as : .sub.GetTop(All) And using .Take(int) works to limit the number retrieved. Ok, fine. But then things get weird. GetTop with any FromTime of .week or larger...week, month, or year, seems to work fine. But .sub.GetTop(FromTime.Hour) AND .sub.GetTop(FromTime.Day) Return a single post from 12/15...3 days ago... (There are no posts within the last day or hour). This DOES happen to be the most recent post...so...maybe that's it?? --- Was thinking perhaps sub.Posts might be a better way to go about this...but can't for the life of me figure out how to filter it at all. Right now it's a sub with 27 posts...not a big deal...but down the road...ugh. **EDIT** Ok, weird...just happened to realize this is probably just pulling the Top/hot/Whatever results same as clicking "Top" in the sub. (Yes, i know, this just dawned on me..I'm not a smart man). Reddit is returning exactly the same 3 day old post for top this day and this hour. So...the wrapper's not borked...but this still makes no sense....
OP, your error is pointing to line 13 of your code. It's very likely complaining about the lack of access modifier on `float offsetZ;` - try making it `private float offsetZ`, as per FireFromTheWire's suggestion. Normally, C# doesn't require access modifiers - it will default to `private` - but Unity might well use a less accommodating compiler which doesn't make these defaults. edit: also, learn not to rely on your text editor's error messages. Read the error messages the compiler throws at you - they always give a line number, or a stack trace if an exception occurs. In this particular case, the (13, 13) part of your error message is the compiler saying "I encountered this error once I got to the 13th line, 13th column. (I.e, to the end of the word "`float`")
I found another problem but it seemed in my range! So I thought about it for a while, did research and a bunch of testing and it worked. Your advice helped a lot. :D
I see, thanks. That was very clear appreciate it a lot!
Go to Micro Center or newegg.com and get a dev machine.
They use the mono compiler. It's not required.
C#? To Javascript? Woah. That's bonkers. Absolutely batty. Completely preposterous. One has to be absolutely out of his gourd to make a thing like this work. It's a million-to-one chance they'll ever get it to work properly to begin with. Exactly million-to-one, as a matter of fact. So it just might work.
Try [CSharpPad](http://csharppad.com)
Great writeup! I am a big fan of c# to javascript, and a huge fan of Saltarelle. I have used it for many of my personal projects, and twice in a large production app. Its nice to use over typescript mostly due to the tooling of typescript being subpar, but also just because of its incredible support for complicated c# constructs like generators, and async. I recommend it to anyone who is interested.
It could be a weird character displaying as whitespace between the ; and the float. Try selecting everything between the ; and the word float and deleting it, and then reformatting it back to how it was. 
Exactly. This is like converting a car to a bicycle.
and then competing in the Dakar rally.
Well, one, if you're writing codebehind in wpf, you're doing it wrong, wpf is meant for mvvm and bindings. &gt;* What the heck is a Reflection? Reflection is the .net method for discovering the properties of an unknown object at runtime. * How can I make my Code less ugly and less buggy INotifyPropertyChanged, {Binding...} expressions, zero codebehind, mvvm, true view models. Edit: What is the actual message of the exception, saying it's a target invocation exception is meaningless. Edit 2: Your math.round +"%" is wrong. Figure out why.
so it got the value of the Slider before the slider got created? yea, that makes sense. -- I don't quite get the part of the making-less-gargabe-part, should i just turn of the Expeption-Alert? I think i misunderstand that, because that wouldnt solve it...
Put ShowButton_Click() back in the code behind file. In ShowButton_Click() call a method on the controller.
Don't use the click event, look into implementing the Icommand interface and creating a relay/delegate/xxx Command (people name it many different things and bind the Command property of the button to that command
this was actually pointed out to me today so thank you i didnt even realize that
It sounds very interesting... My only concern would be the little "gotchas" all languages seem to have... The weird little quirks that show up and make life miserable. I'm sure you know what I am talking about. "Why doesn't this compile??!". "I clearly set the sprite to do X. Why the hell is it doing Y?" Usually solutions are a few google searches away (unless God forbid, you are trying to install some Minecraft mod), but this seems like it would be a little more... difficult to find support. Have you found this to be true? Or is it fairly straight forward?
All of /nSoftware's components have proxy support. http://www.nsoftware.com/ The IP*Works suite has an FTP component. 
Yeah good write up! I have used Script# / Saltaralle before. I liked it, however I am surprised that you were able to make something on this scale! Great job with the game, it is actually a lot of fun to play. I need to work out how to kill those bloody spiders!!
So you're saying there's a chance?
This is the straightforward approach. Any saves or whatever funtionality you need should be passed to the controller from the event
Hey nphekt I think I hit that 1 in a million. Erik Kallen should however take the credit though :) Erik has done an exceptional job and the tool is very stable. Most of my C# 4.0 code compiles to JS without any problems. Postbug is a prime example of what can be done with this technology: [Postbug game](http://postbug.hemingwaygames.com) 
Hi CaptainIncredible, good point on the "gotchas." My other concern is performance limitations that might arise from the translation (since I'm writing games). For this reason, I use a subset of the C# language (eg avoid yield statements and lamba expressions) and I also like to wrap Javascript libraries (eg Pixi.js). I found a performance hit with 2d arrays so I created my own implementation named FastArray2d :). I don't work with the DOM (ie I instead render with WebGL), so maybe someone else can comment on this aspect. Also keep an eye on the Javascript which gets output, which I do when debugging. Regarding Saltarelle support, the github issues page should be your first port of call: https://github.com/erik-kallen/SaltarelleCompiler/issues 
&gt; Calling CreateList&lt;Point&gt;(50) in older versions of C# will return a list of 50 Point objects, however, each point will be invalid since the X,Y and Z properties will default to zero. &gt; With C# 6, all points in the list will have the desired initial values for X, Y and Z. &gt; &gt; There is a bug in this feature and it doesn't currently work quite as expected. There's not a bug, this is intended behaviour. It's the same deal with `var x = default(Point);`. List also uses `default(T)` and this is not supposed to call any constructor.
Thanks for your interest everyone. Source-to-source compiling is an interesting area and I don't see any reason why a language (whether it's Javascript, C#, c++, java etc) should be bound to a particular platform. The extensive list of languages that compile to JS maintained on the [CoffeeScript's wiki page](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js) shows the interest in this area. I mentioned asm.js and the LLVM / Emscripten toolchain in my blog post and they are gaining serious momentum. Firefox are leading the way in implementing targeted optimisations for the Javascript subset and Unity have taken on the ambitious project of exporting their game engine with the toolchain (Unity 5.0). 
Hmm, lambdas are native to Js, or is it so slow?
I think he is referring to the c# 6.0 behaviour. The `CreateList&lt;T&gt;()` method in the example uses `new T()`, not `default(T)`. 
Setting up the scope of a lambda has performance impacts in js. It can also lead to memory leaks in js with circular references if not used correctly. I have always tried to avoid them in performance critical method, unless they are really required. I'm happy to be corrected on this...
It has to set up the arguments variable etc. Just because it is native doesn't mean it is fast, ie eval()...
It's a Discworld reference, really. While I still think you should be in a mental institution, this is extremely impressive. 
I wouldn't worry too much about performance until you need to fine tune your code. The browsers on desktop are very fast with JIT. When you want to fine tune the performance, run the Chrome profiler. This is how I found a performance hit with 2d arrays (hence the need to create FastArray2d). My biggest concern however with Javascript performance would be the garbage collector (which isn't related to source-to-source compiling). ie I'd try and avoid creating too many objects (eg 2d vectors) during a critical loops such as a path finding algorithm.
A closure is a variable, with its own local scope variables held in memory. Very powerful and very useful but can quickly lead to issues if not used correctly. Garbage collection and closures have been a source of problems. Hence IE Drip. Great to use, but use wisely...
Oh, that's a relief. Do you have a source I can go read up on? Thanks!
But in the context of wpf, it's a bad methodology. Wpf is designed for bindings, mvvm and inotifypropertychanged
Cool, thanks for the info.
I don't really need an information trade but I'm somewhat uniquely positioned to help you learn whatever you need. I've been working with a FX group at a private investment bank for 18 months now doing development in support of their currency hedging business, so not stocks or options, but markets and trading nonetheless. Feel free to pm me or ask questions you have in here. 
While I appreciate your willingness to learn, I don't believe this post is appropriate for the **C# language** subreddit and as such it has been removed. I encourage you to repost it to a more relevant subreddit, perhaps /r/learnprogramming, /r/coding, /r/programmingdiscussion, or /r/programmingbuddies.
The bug is that it uses the constructor for the first instance and then doesn't for the following ones. I continue to remain convinced that no struct datatypes should ever have constructors.
But having constructors allows for immutable types, whose values get set only at construction.
What I was thinking, ideally your viewmodel shouldn't know anything about the view.
Without bindings and inotifypropertychanged, aka, the winforms standard, it's almost impossible to separate views from view models.
I heard someone mentioned that VS 2015 Preview can be installed on other drives other than C. Or you can create free trial Azure account and create a VM with VS 2013 image. You can use that account for one month.
You can have immutable structs without constructors (which are never guaranteed to be called): public struct MyImmutableStruct1 { public int Value { get; private set; } public bool Initialized { get; private set; } public static MyImmutableStruct1 Create(int value) { return new MyImmutableStruct1 { Initialized = true, Value = value }; } } It is really a pedantic difference (that create method could just as well be a constructor): public struct MyImmutableStruct2 { public int Value { get; private set; } public bool Initialized { get; private set; } public MyImmutableStruct2(int value) : this() { Initialized = true; Value = value; } } But remember optional paremeters? You can do this (valid C#5): public struct MyImmutableStruct3 { public int Value { get; private set; } public bool Initialized { get; private set; } public MyImmutableStruct3(int value = 0) : this() { Initialized = true; Value = value; } } What is the value of `new MyImmutableStruct3().Initalized` (and does this change when compiled in C#6)? I prefer to not have any constructors on structs as a rule because I generally do not have immutable structs in my code. I also tend to not use structs for anything remotely complex because I've never come up with a situation where the semantic differences between a complex reference type and a complex value type outweigh the burden of knowing you are doing so.
Exactly that.
This is likely the best solution on this thread.
Love it! I must read some of Terry Pratchett's books. 
You absolutely should! I myself like the Guards and Death the most, but you could start anywhere, really. Here, have a [chart](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/22600000/Discworld-Reading-Order-discworld-22614060-1280-960.gif).

Once again, I love this comment nphekt. I've quoted you on my blog in the footer :)
Does this make me internet-famous? Where will I be able to collect my internet money? Am I going to have to answer questions about jackdaws now?
ex-VB. Still getting used to C#'s trust issues
when using the stream reader, would it be considered good practice to only use it inside of a "using block"? instead of calling close when you are done with it? or would this be bad form? Edit: Sorry, didnt read Robenheimer's comment before i posted this.
If someone links it, I'd love to see it. I was able to set it up for building projects on my linux box, but I'd love to get it going for C#.
But how much do you get per year?
Yea. If you don't mind telling. How much do you make a year? Or how much does a C# programmer make?
This will give you an idea of where you can go with experience. http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=C%23+Net+Developer
Even an entry level job with little experience should make more money than Walmart will ever pay you (unless you go into upper management at Walmart). That said, programming has to be treated as a craft to really get good and make really good money: It's something that will take time to learn, but then takes additional years of actually writing code and building things to master. It also changes constantly, so there will always be new things to learn. 
If it's just the basics you're looking for, GH has its own tutorial that works really well: https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/ and an interactive one here https://try.github.io//levels/1/challenges/1 I also wrote [a quick primer on Git](http://blog.tankorsmash.com/?p=406), maybe that'd help you a bit
There are several things wrong with this. I don't know how you declared your timer, but usually you give it a period (I.e. 1 second) and the event handler is called for you periodically so there is no need to have a loop and restart the timer in your loop (unless your timer was non recurring). For your specific problem you have a loop that does 60 iterations but you set your counter variable to 60 and decrement it by one on every iteration, so it will never go below 59, if it makes sense.

Pro tip #1: It's college with an e. :-) Personally, I'd recommend both. Teach yourself and go to college. You'll make tons of networking contacts at college. The professors might be able to hook you up with job prospects or you can start businesses or get referrals from you classmates.
Thanks
Read the documentation. It seems like you don't have an upstream repository configured for the project.
Pro tip: If you're using VS2013 or VS2015 the git integration is fantastic. I rarely use git bash now. I think the GUI of the Team Explorer when using Git really helps visualize the concepts of using git, particularly committing changes.
I suggest you try /r/learnprogramming, and if you're thinking about careers, /r/cscareerquestions.
I do not believe this is appropriate for the **C# language** subreddit. I encourage you to repost it to a more relevant subreddit, or perhaps a StackExchange site like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [SuperUser](http://superuser.com).
well, thinking about it, that also wont work because you would still be setting your counter to 60 every 1 second, I guess you need to move the "int counter = 60;" somewhere else, like right above your Intialize Component()....
....declaring your counter (just to show you where I would declare it)...... public partial class Form1 : Form { public int counter = 60;//This is declared at the beginning of your program, //if it is the only counter you could leave it named //as this, if it is one of several counters consider //renaming it to something more appropriate public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); ..... then your timer tick method... private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (textBox1.Text != "0") { counter--; textBox1.Text = Convert.ToString(counter); } else { this.Hide(); Form SetChoice = new SetChoice(); SetChoice.Show(); counter = 60; } } if you don't want your count-down to start immediately you could stop the timer at the end of the else statement and restart it whenever you are ready within the SetChoice form. basically you don't need the for loop if you have the timer firing every 1 second. Every one second that the timer it is on, it will evaluate the if-else statement and act appropriately. Edit: Also I keep editing this because i come back and realize what was i thinking there is an easier way to do this, like I said before I'm also a beginner, however I think this addresses your problem appropriately, hopefully we can get a more seasoned programmer to let us know. Cheers
Github for Windows is stellar as well.
Have a look at this [C# Fundamentals](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners) series, it's a fantastic introduction.
Have you tried running disk cleanup in admin mode to delete things like old service packs? Also, have you disabled hibernation? Have you moved the pagefile to another disk? Have you disabled everything but C# while installing Visual studio? Have you considered uninstalling something else, or moving it elsewhere? How big is this boot ssd? If all of this doesn't work, I'd recommend either getting a bigger drive, or simply not bothering. LinqPAD is great, but it's not really a visual studio replacement, just a nifty extra tool. And there's no real comparison to visual studio. Wasting time chasing every last byte probably isn't worth it; pick a different experiment I'd say. Similarly, learning C# without trying one of the key features - the IDE - is not spending time efficiently.
That's not going to work either, because readline blocks, potentially indefinitely (unless you know the log file will constantly grow) - any termination condition checking code simply won't run. You'll need to use an async read method.
 Console.WriteLine("Date"); Console.ReadLine(); //to keep the console window open Take a look at [these tutorials](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners) on Microsoft Virtual Academy
Even a starting position will pay more than retail. I wouldn't say that it's a *hard* industry to get into, but if your expectation is that you'll just read a book and get hired, however, you might be disappointed. Whether you get some kind of certifications (CS diploma or MCSE or something like that), or you just prove yourself by creating your own projects, you will need to invest a couple years into the process before you start seeing any returns. That said, if you can achieve competency, you have excellent opportunities and security as long as you continue to care.
Dp you happen to know of any videos I could watch to show how to set up and use the VS git integration in an actual project?
Workout seeing your code, i can't actually tell you anything for certain. Are you actually referencing your control from the main page?
Can you share the code for your form/control/widnow? There shouldn't be any issue with naming a column "Name"
Without looking at the contents of the file being read by theDataFile, but my first guess would be that a line in that file doesn't end with something that triggers .ReadLine() to see it as a line. Maybe a line is lacking a CR+LF or something like that?
Seconded: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
The best way would be to create a class to represent a task and then have a collection of those tasks in a generic collection that you could bind to a listbox. class PomoTask { public Datetime TaskDate {get;set;} public string TaskDescr { get; set; } public int PomodoroCount { get; set; } } private List&lt;PomoTask&gt; Tasks = new List&lt;PomoTask&gt;(); 
For the list, /u/cuscutis has the right answer. For saving it into the executable, that is highly discouraged and impracticable. You'd have to recompile the program every time you save. Which requires a compiler. Which is more than one file. If you want a quick and easy way to save and read stuff, I usually just serialize an object or list to an xml file. The downside is that this is not very scalable and as you get more data this will quickly become bothersome. The better way is to use any form of database. There are very nice built in functions for generating them out of classes and interacting with them. 
Both. I've found that a combination of both makes the best programmers. There are a lot of "teach yourself!" Online academies and websites. The truth is that they will teach you to make basic apps and some programming basics. Colleges on the other hard will teach you how to make software properly (if it's a good college). They will teach you advanced topics that you will miss on your own, namely data structures, design patters, optimization etc. But they won't teach you everything. My college carrier is mixed between doing course work, job work and personal projects. I always try to find something to code. You should use your college education as a platform and keep adding on top of it. I think that is the best way to get "the most" out of learning to become a programmer (and the learning part never stops!)
This is a great answer. OP, keep in mind that depending on your objects, you may want/need to implement IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;. 
For implementing a tic-tac-toe AI player, take a look at the _minimax_ algorithm. 
Before your for loop, declare a long to store the total size. long size = 0; Inside the for loop, you can just put the following: size += files[numFiles].Length; Also, keep in mind your method for "counting" files is a bit unnecessary. You could just use Console.Write("Total Files: {0}",files.Length); at the end, and it would give the same value. `numFiles` shouldn't really be used to count the files, but rather **only** as an index to look in your `files` array and the get the size of each file. Let me know if you have questions!
You've probably knocked the db into offline or suspect mode. Try connecting to master instead with the same details. If you get in try dbcc checkdb. You can also get hold of SSMS free download which will give you the full gui over sqls and enable you to mess with security. I'm told sql data tools for VS can do this too.
Thank you very much, i have done what you said it works perfectly, i've come across another issue though, I'm trying to display the name of the largest file along with it's size, but this is what it keeps telling me: http://imgur.com/A1uj811 Sorry for being a pain, thank you for the help.
No problem! Where are you first initializing `fileName` and `largFile`? Also, inside your for loop, if you set the new maximum, you end up adding to the total size **twice**. What you should have is something like for(numFiles = 0; numFiles &lt; files.Length;numFiles++) { size += files[numFiles].Length; if(largFile &lt; files[numFiles].Length) { fileName = files[numFiles].Name; largFile = files[numFiles].Length; } }

I've been learning for a year and a half and have indeed only used it once.
What kind of array? You mean native arrays like: double[] doublearray = new double[10]; Or do you mean List&lt;T&gt;, Dictionary&lt;T, T&gt;, etc? Or do you mean all of them?
I have a trouble thinking of many class objects I write where I don't use an array, which is why I'm confused by your statement... I guess it depends on what you're programming...
I am first initializing it at the very top of the code just under the static void main bit :/ Edit -- Ahh i fixed it! i just had to put something inside of it! :D e.g. string fileName = "test";
*Anyway, I would have one array for questions with a custom object for the questions allowing it to be marked "special":* public class Question { public string QuestionText; public bool SpecialFlag; } Question[] Questions = new Question[150]; *and a second array for the answers:* bool[] Answers = new bool[150] *Use a public variable for the "Browse question" number.* public int QuestionNumber = 0; public void Save(object sender, EventArgs e) { ///Get the previous answer and store it in the Answers[QuestionNumber] part of the answers array. QuestionNumber++; /// Run a routine to update the screen to the new Questions[QuestionNumber].QuestionText string }
Well I think the biggest problem is that they want to cram as much theory as possible in the few hours they get and assume you'll practice on your own. Only problem is that I can't think of any exercise myself. This is also the reason I'm using /r/dailyprogrammer as much as I can and I'm learning a lot by just checking the solutions of other people because they use stuff in ways I could/would never think of.
Find something fun to program in your spare time. Download Unity and make a dorky game or something - anything to help challenge you to set out and discover your own answers to problems and push you to learn more. I assume you frequently reference the C# library on MSDN? If you don't have a passion for it, have something you want to program and are learning to do in your spare time, actively applying the theory you're learning, you're probably going to struggle a lot. Arrays are a core principle in all programming and are used extensively in nearly any kind of program. For your particular problem, I was imagining you could make a text file with all the questions then you can StremReader.ReadLine() through the file and fill in the question text in your question array to have it in active memory for your program. Maybe in the text file you can end each line with a SP or something and then check the end of the line if it's marked as a "special question." 
One day I was making a class (for fun) that converted height maps to tangent normal maps. Then I got annoyed that there wasn't a control that was really good with images - like the image browser that comes with Windows. You can zoom a picture box easily, or drag it around or autoscroll it, or have it fit to the control easily. Next thing I know, I'm spending a few hours writing a completely new control object that gives me a universal imageviewer control object I can include in forms: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KM5HIZxJb1qWBI1xnr8NUkopBK8zNMbKtHfVfg7jJ8Q/pub Point is, if you find something you want to program, it will lead you down tangents that expand your horizons. Even if you don't finish it, you will have chased enough tangents that you've learned stuff in the process.
Currently I'm making programs for friends/family. I've recently completed my first program for someone that organizes events. Problem is 90% of the code is copy paste from google, although I know what every line of code does, I couldn't come up with the solutions myself. I will definitely check out unity! I've literally never used an array in anything I made, I simply cannot make the connection of a problem with a solution containing an array. I considered using a textfile but I want to be able to just give people the .exe without any extra hassle.
You can't really "teach" the kind of problem solving thinking it requires to be able to construct systems of logical operation. That's something that you kind of pick up from doing enough math or coming up with some sort of way you "visualize" parts of a computer program in your head. For example, I visualize arrays in my head as a bunch of square boxes which hold whatever I'm stuffing in them with little arrows pointing to the current box symbolizing: ArrayofBoxes[arrow];
I've started making random stuff as much as I can, but I keep running into the same problem and that is that I try to solve everything with stuff I know. But the stuff I know is very limited so I find myself googling the most simple stuff. Now some stuff sticks but I find myself googling some issues over and over again and alway stumble on the same sort of solution. I can say with 100% certainty that I'm learning something new daily but it just feels that some stuff can't stay in my head :D
&gt;Problem is 90% of the code is copy paste from google, although I know what every line of code does, I couldn't come up with the solutions myself. How far did you study math? There's a lot of solutions I couldn't come up with on my own. When I wanted a noise generator, I learned how the Perlin algorithm worked and then adapted it to my needs by rewriting it for use in my program. Some advanced concepts are usually copied by people, like Perlin noise which requires a decent amount of math knowledge and intuition to spontaneously come up with. But you should be able to figure out how to put together a few arrays and iterate through them - if this is a serious kind of block for you - you might be studying the wrong thing because there's just some people in the world who don't understand how to put together algorithms at all - just like there's some people who, no matter how much they study math, won't be able to do well in it.
So basically make as much exercises as I can that I know for sure that contain the stuff I have problems with until it becomes second nature? 
public static string[] Questions = new string[]{ "This is not special", "This is special", "This is also special", "Not Special", "etc" }; public static bool[] Specials = new bool[]{ false, true, true, false, false };
Or if you want to be crazy, you might be able to do it with a KeyValuePair: public static KeyValuePair&lt;string, bool&gt;[] Questions = new KeyValuePair&lt;string, bool&gt;[]{ new KeyValuePair&lt;string, bool&gt;("This is not special", false), new KeyValuePair&lt;string, bool&gt;("This is special", true), ... } 
Put it this way, I've never taken a single programming class in my life - not one. I have no idea how to work with SQL in C# because I've never tried that. But what you described as a program I could come up with easily and I've only been off and on programming for like a year. How can I do this? Because I come up with the idea for a project way bigger than I'll ever finish, and I start working at it. When I hit roadblocks, I do research and learn something new, then I keep going. I chase down tangents and create objects way too general for the use I'm making them for with the idea that I can later copy and paste this code into a different project for something else. Practicing lots is how you get the hang of how programs fit together.
I don't know what you mean with how far I studied math? (English isn't my first language) But math was and is still one of my best + easiest course. I have no problem at all making small programs. But when I have to make something bigger I just choke somehow. For example a program needs to do a, b, c and d. I think of a way to code a, b, c and d. But it's extremely hard to make a, then make b, then make c, then make d and then add everything together. I've spoken with my teacher about the issues I have and he said I have a problem with cutting up a program in manageable pieces.
Ah, now I understand. I might even try to do this with multidimensional arrays after i got this to work. You have been a tremendous help and I couldn't thank you enough!
Yeah, I really have no idea how to give someone an answer for something like that. You could try getting some sort of flow chart maker and that might help you plan and learn to organize your thoughts better.
When I was programming in C++ I used a flowchart maker to keep track of inheritance hierarchies of header files.
Ah so it's not just me that can't remember anything, that's a relief. I've also never literally copied pasted stuff into something I'm making. However I will regularly copy paste stuff into a new project and play with it to figure out exactly how it works. Once I'm confident I know everything about it, I'll rewrite it into the program I'm making.
That's also an array, it's just an array of KeyValuePair objects.
So it's an array that exists of pairs containing a string en bool value? Instead of 2 arrays separately?
Been experimenting with this recently, I basically make a flowchart on paper before I start doing anything else. Sometimes it's very easy, sometimes it takes me days. I guess it's just a learning process.
Yea, guess so. I just thought it was weird how I have these humps with some other stuff as well :) and it just started to annoy me after a while.
Some people have greater or lesser procedural intuition. I have no idea what differentiates people like that. When I was taking calculus some students took it way more seriously than I ever would and held study sessions and went to tutors and spent hours doing extra problems from their homework - and they'd still get a C on the test. Other people would do half the homework and skip a third of the entire semester and ace every test.
So as to use our example I can just as easily use public class Questions { public string questionText; public bool specialQuestion; } public Questions[] question = new Questions[143]; question[0].questionText = "Q1"; question[0].specialQuestion = true; question[1].questionText = "Q2"; question[1].specialQuestion = false; Instead of keyvaluepair
Yep, and if you add a constructor to your Questions class: public Questions(string text, bool special) { questionText = text; specialQuestion = special; } you can initialize it like this: public Questions[] QuestionArray = new Questions[]{ new Questions("question 1", true), new Questions("Question 2", false), ... }
Slowly grasping the possibilities of arrays. Once again you've been of tremendous help and I can't thank you enough!
here's a way to make a multidimensional array: double[][] multiarray = new double[][] { new double[5], new double[5], new double [5], ... } Or you can make a List of Lists: List&lt;List&lt;double&gt;&gt; ListofLists = new List&lt;List&lt;double&gt;&gt;(); for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { ListofLists.Add(new List&lt;double&gt;()); } for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { for(int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) { ListofLists[i][j] = Random.NextDbl(0, 10.0); } }
As a software engineer with about 7 years of experience (and a 4-year degree), I don't use arrays very often. If I need to store an arbitrary number of something, I tend to use a list. You may want to google when to use arrays vs lists and the pros/cons for both. [This](http://geekexplains.blogspot.com/2008/05/array-vs-linked-list-advantages-and.html) is a good article outlining when to use them. The article is written for C++, but there is a lot of carry-over to C#. With only 1 and a half years of programming experience, you might not be familiar with linked lists but they are basically the same as the C# version of the list. \--- As for your program, I think you're on the right track. I would define my own class to store a string for the question, a bool for the correct answer, a bool for the answer the user picked and a bool to indicate whether it is a special answer. I would use a list to store multiple question-answer objects. In more advanced programs, the list of question-answer objects would be known as a [data model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model). 
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; [**Data model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20model): [](#sfw) --- &gt; &gt;A __data model__ organizes [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. Since data elements document [real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life) people, places and things and the events between them, the data model represents reality, for example a house has many windows or a cat has two eyes. [Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) are used for the accounting of these real life things and events and therefore the data model is a necessary standard to ensure exact [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication) between human beings. &gt;Data models are often used as an aid to communication between the business people defining the [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements) for a [computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_system) and the technical people defining the design in response to those requirements. They are used to show the data needed and created by [business processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process). &gt;Precise accounting and communication is a large expense and organizations traditionally paid the cost by having employees translate between themselves on an ad hoc basis. In critical situations such as air travel, healthcare and finance, it is becoming commonplace that the accounting and communication must be precise and therefore requires the use of common data models to obviate risk. &gt;==== &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/DreY3GH.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Data_modeling_context.svg) - *Overview of data modeling context: Data model is based on Data, Data relationship, Data semantic and Data constraint.

Style the DataGrid. http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/586132/WPF-DataGrid-Custommization-using-Style-and-Templa
Yes I know I should style it, but I have no idea how to get the ListView look. Is there a cheat sheet or something with styles? :) And I want the default behavior with the mouse over effect, basically to look *exactly* like a ListView.
Holy shit, you spend 1 and a half year **NOT** programming at all? Why are you even trying to learn programming at this point, you should be looking at a different career choice. You're absolutely not motivated at all to do any programming if you're still stuck on this problem after 1.5 years. Programming IS NOT for everyone. If you want to prove me and everyone else that we're wrong, then pull your weight and actually program something. It doesn't matter WHAT program, just make anything. For an example, Instant Messenger (Experiment with encryption if you want) Extensible Notepad (Adding new things to it on the fly.) Create simple MVC Website Make a bloodly simple XNA game It doesn't matter WHAT IT IS, just LEARN SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN! FFS! Downvote away, you fucking cunts. 
Thanks for the links, I'll definitely check them out! 
You can't if you don't have money..
Sure does, because I actually try to make a positive contribution at work and there's always a fucktard like you being the villain at work and fuck everything up intentionally. You have to realize that at one point, PROGRAMMING IS NOT FOR YOU. And be rest assured, I did fired a lot of people like you and have them blacklisted in several companies around in my city. So if you come across with me, your programming career is DONE.
You are not helping, that's not because he sounds young that you have to tell him "go find somewhere else" If you know the answer reply, if you don't just shut up That's not because you have 9541212454 degrees that you have to act like god,i hate people like you
Never use the c:\Windows directory for testing!
C# doesn't allow you to access a variable unless it has been initialized. Since your assignment of "fileName" happens inside of an if statement the compiler detects that it **may** not be initialized (for example if the directory contains no files at all it would never be initialized) so it gives you that compiler error. 
Also, maybe try to get your money back.
Going to slap this here. You could consider the [DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles();](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd383574\(v=vs.110\).aspx) I have found it useful for directories that contain a large number of files.
No. People need to learn to ask proper questions first, right away. This is part of the progress to learn to help yourself.
You need to pass it along to it when you create an instance of Form2, or initalize it somehow. Is Form2 the same type as Form1? Shouldn't you have some constructor for your Form you can use? Couldn't you just do: Form Form2 = new Form( Form1.username ); Something along those lines.
Yes it is the same type. I am initalizing it by typing Submit Submit = new Submit(); But I can't pass variables through it... Whenever i put something like Form1.username it say's the same thing, that constructor doesnt take 1 argument... This is quite annoying :P
Well it should have some form of get and set methods.
That's kind of like asking how much a baseball player makes. If you're me, nothing, if you're awesome, 25 million a year. There's no question the potential rewards from programming are going to be substantially better than virtually any position in retail. Why? There are fewer people who provide the service and fewer still that are good at it. That said, I've been doing it for 30+ years and in my opinion it's not a job you can do well unless it's something you love to do. Like, you'd be doing it anyway even if you weren't getting paid to do it. It requires enormous patience and it can be like working on a 10,000 piece puzzle. If that's a challenge you enjoy, if you like working in an arena that changes constantly and requires that you are always learning, then it's a great career. If it's not something you really enjoy but want to do for the money, you'll hate it and honestly, you won't be that good at it. 
Sorry for the formating I'm writing on a phone no code features 
I didn't, I'll have a look and see if I can use this. Thanks man! Edit: just tried it... It's fairly buggy :(
Okay, Now that i've made the constructor, how do i define a variable from what has been passed? I have public Submit(string username) { } in Submit.cs, and Submit Submit = new Submit(this.username.Text); so in that constructor, how would i make the "username" variable that is passed, a variable in Submit.cs? is it something like this? public Submit(string username) { InitializeComponent(); string passedUsername = username; } and if it is, how would i now use it somewhere else? (like if i need to check what it is. ive tried this.passedUsername, Submit.passedusername but it isnt working...) 
U created the passedUsername variable inside the constructor so it's scope is only the constructor u can't use it outside of it U can declare it outside the constructor as private string passedusername; and it will work or use the second option with property it will do the same 
I fixed it nevermind :D YAY I've done it guys! Only took a few hours and A LOT of help!
Then you should absolutely do it. I don't think there's ever been a more exciting time to be a programmer. If you get good enough you will have plenty of opportunity.
Thank you. It's good to have some positive feed back. It's a hell of a long road to go. But everyday it gets more and more easy for me to understand that this is what i need to do...and want to do with my life.
It would be nice. I'd like to see traits in C#. Also D does not support multiple inheritance, but it has mixins.
This....would actually be really nice. And as you say, it could be implemented as just regular code transformations. If it doesn't make it into the language then maybe it could be implemented as an extension with Roslyn.
Yeah, was thinking you could quite easily add this as a language extension with Roslyn. Alternatively, you could do it with a bunch of T4 magic. The only problem I'm seeing is that a lot of the classes I want to proxy, use types that are sealed or have private constructors - so the point of proxying it (testability, in my case) is a little defeated. 
Already did and currently doing the 2nd yea for free. Although I think it's worth the money, it's just this one teacher that's severely lacking.
50 dkp minus for putting { on the end of the line. 
I couldn't figure out how to do that properly, even though I already have SSMS. So I deleted the database. But when I tried to create a new Service-Based database with the same name I had the same problem. So I created the database with a slightly different name and the problem is gone. Should I have deleted something else when I deleted the database? I'll have to look for a good tutorial site so I can learn how to do what you suggested.
I can see that you've already got a fix for your problem, but now might be a good time for you to read about some of the patterns that professional programmers use to overcome these sorts of issues. These include the Model-View-Controller pattern that's widely used across many object-oriented languages, and the Model-View-View Model pattern used in WPF programming. Both of these try to separate information entered by the user (the model), from the way it's presented (Form1, Form2 etc). If you adopted one of these approaches, Form1 and Form2 could both be separate views of the same model, and when the submit button is pressed, Form1 could simply pass it's model to Form2 (perhaps as a constructor parameter).
I code all my wpf pages in raw xaml for one reason: it forces me to have a nearly complete conceptual layout of the form in my head before i start. It also has the added benefit of avoiding the ultimate wpf layout copout, margin. Everything is in grids. I also don't start developing the page until the backing class it's defined along with all its commands and property change notifications.
Are you gonna use source control from now on? I use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), which is free and offsite.
The problem with this is same as the problem with every AI attempt ever. Living beings experience time as a continuum, computers can only experienced it as finite time slices. What happens if the conditions defining appropriateness change after you've checked them? At what point does your system have enough information to truly decide that a thought is appropriate? Consider a high throughput, life and death situation, my favorite is a Formula 1 race. Think of how many conditions a driver has to recognize, prioritize and consider during every second of the race, you may say that in a practical sense, the computational speed of modern computers makes this irrelevant but what if a condition affecting the outcome of a decision comes in while that decision's distortions are being processed, or worse, after the outcome of a decision has been computed but not yet executed. How do you interrupt one decision execution with the execution of another decision's conclusion.
Good news, this is the perfect time to learn CIL (formerly MSIL). You can use ILDASM which comes with the .NET platform (I believe, it may be a VS thing) and disassemble your .NET exe into the CIL and from there you could take this as a double learning opportunity or if you don't want to do that, I'm sure there are tools that convert CIL to C#.
This might help you. http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx
Blend, although it's not too different to the Visual Studio IDE. What is so difficult about using Visual Studio? It's pretty straightforward drag-and-drop + manual editing.
I have had great success with [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/). It's free, works great, and in the cases I had to use it on, preserved proper names of methods and variables.
Same here on writing it in raw xaml. I really like the control coding in xaml gives me over the details of the view.
There's nothing wrong with the best bracing convention ever created by humans.
Oops, made a mistake with D there. I also can't find the reference for the delegation syntax, though I believe it has one. I'll just remove the comment for now. If you can point me in the right place (docs) I'll add it back. Though it isn't necessary for the article, it's just an example list. 
I use [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/). It's free, open-source and it works. I found myself in the same situation at work with an operations tool that I wrote. ILSpy worked like a charm.
It was one of those off the cuff sideline projects, that I did, and thought I wouldn't need again .. and it sat in my "DEV Projects" folder ... then i deleted the VM like a muppet. But yes, that is a lesson learnt, and I'll check out BitBucket :) 
I'll check that out now ... It sounds like a good path to take from an educational point of view. 
Ya, it is a much longer path and doesn't give you direct results but it is interesting. I started a subreddit dedicated to this /r/learncil there isn't much there but it can get you started hopefully.
I think for a lot of people with experience in HTML, doing the XAML by hand comes very natural. I usually struggle with using the designer, because it's not always consistent in what output it produces. &gt; ultimate wpf layout copout, margin I hadn't even thought of it like that (as a copout). Someone told me they were fine with WPF/XAML. When they gave me the result I understood why. They just used the designer to essentially do WinForms in XAML (margins and full code behind).
&gt; if (textBox1.Text != "0") &gt; { &gt; counter--; &gt; textBox1.Text = Convert.ToString(counter); &gt; &gt; } &gt; else &gt; { &gt; this.Hide(); &gt; Form SetChoice = new SetChoice(); &gt; SetChoice.Show(); &gt; counter = 60; &gt; } Sorry for the late reply. This almost works, but it counts down from 60 in two at a time rather than one at a time. Any idea why? Much thanks for your thorough response regardless.
[ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/) is pretty good for this if you have the assemblies. 
https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/ , Free + "Exporting decompiled code to Visual Studio projects"
Over simplified, for sure, but wouldn't a small enough time slice solve that problem?
Even better, check out Github, get the hang of git, and then move to BB.
&gt; It was one of those off the cuff sideline projects &gt; it took me months to write the first time I don't understand how could the two be true at the same time.
Doesn't [DynamicProxy](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) already solve this?
use ilspy if you have the assemblies.
And super tiny
Thanks, Ill look into that! I ended up using a constructor :) but yeah, I'll defiantly be researching all of that :) 
https://www.piriform.com/recuva/download Run this and try and recover the VM :)
DotPeek works well, better than ILSpy IMO. Although it sometimes doesn't know how to decompile optimizations and puts gotos in those places.
Github doesn't have free private repos.
&gt;However, I have read that it is smart to ignore most socketexceptions. Where have you read that? The purpose of exceptions, in general, is to let the programmer know that something exceptional has happened (something that isn't expected). If you ignore exceptions then you are missing areas where you could log errors or otherwise retry a connection.
It might do this, but their documentation seems to lack and overview and simple examples. I couldn't figure out exactly what they provide. In any case, it's something that I'd like to see at the language level.
Which exceptions are you getting, specifically? Generally, you should do your best to try to handle exceptions gracefully and let your program take the appropriate actions when an exception is generated.
https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/6874837-proxies-for-type-composition
I used effort but was hard to get working due to the lack of documentation. Once I did get it working, it was great. Is it out of beta?
This is a... no? I said Roslyn discussions board. That's a much better place for something like this nowadays.
Just a note, you can get 5 free personal repos with an .edu email.
I assume that's an extension used for educational insntances but i've never seen one (and yes, i'm a student). Maybe it's more common in america (or the place where you do live) but what you're suggesting is not really an option for 'free' private repos for most people.
We unit test everything up to the external interfaces - i.e we don't try and unit test webservice clients, or database repositories. Our argument is that they should be purely mapping and control code for the external interfaces, they shouldn't contain any business logic. Trying to unit test for every path that could happen is a giant pain in the hole. We mitigate this by having integration tests written that cover all the normal operations to a real instance (trying to cover for situations like network timeouts or latency or config level things such as SQL Authentication is even more of a pain). 
I think it's still in beta. It was cool for loading up CSVs and that data being reflected. Documentation is definitely lacking.
I got mine a couple of days ago ... they sent me 4 of them. I don't know why, but I'm lousy with those little guys.
Code monkey?
Yeah, probably Three methods over two classes. interface IDataRepository { TypeA GetDataFromTableA(); void LogResult(TypeB); } class DataRepository : IDataRepository { // implement } class FooProcessor { IDataRepository _repo; public FooProcessor(IDataRepository repo) { _repo = repo; } void DoThing() { var resultA = _repo.GetDataFromTableA(); if (resultA == null) // whatever { _repo.LogResult("blah"); } } } Then your unit test for FooProcessor looks something like this (if you were using Moq and NUnit): [TestFixture] public void FooProcessorTest { [Test] void ShouldLogResultWhenResultAIsNull() { var repo = new Mock&lt;IDataRepository&gt;(); repo.Setup(s=&gt;s.GetDataFromTableA()).Returns(null); var instance = new FooProcessor(repo.Object); instance.DoThing(); repo.Verify(v=&gt;v.LogResult(It.IsAny&lt;string&gt;()), Times.Never(), "Should never have been called"); } [Test] void ShouldNotLogResultWhenDataReturned() { var repo = new Mock&lt;IDataRepository&gt;(); repo.Setup(s=&gt;s.GetDataFromTableA()).Returns(new TypeA()); var instance = new FooProcessor(repo.Object); instance.DoThing(); repo.Verify(v=&gt;v.LogResult("blah"), Times.Once(), "Should have been called with 'blah'"); } } (excuse the typos/syntax errors/mispellings/etc - writing this on my lunch break on a non-dev machine) The next question that comes up is "Right, but that becomes unmanageable if you have a lot of dependencies". True, it does - but that's an indicator that you're trying to do too many things and that you should probably re-think how your code is structured. 
Picked up mine at the visual studio launch. Good product, high cost though :)
I looked for a discussion board, that's what I found. Do you have a link to what you're suggesting? 
https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/topics/5998/c-language-design This is where the writer of the C# compiler and the designer of the language are nowadays.
If you want, use my PerfCopy library, it's kinda designed just for this. (it's on nuget)
Well, expert robotic drivers could come in handy. Plus, this discussion only uses that as an example, the solution could apply to vast swaths of AI challenges. 
Try breaking everything up in pieces. You don't specify what kind of information you want from the external website. Are you calling an API? Do you need a web crawler? 1. You can for example create a program as a windows service that run a function every hour. 2. Store it in a database. 3. Create a web application (webforms, mvc, whatever you like) and deploy it in IIS You're asking for a lot of stuff here, so as I said, try breaking it up in pieces. Perhaps start with the first one as a console application which you know a little about, and then rewrite it as a windows service when you're done with 1 and 2. Then start looking up how you build web sites and try getting a couple of charts up etc. 
When you're using a DB in your VS projects it is slightly complicated by the fact that they can be managed and deployed when you build depending on how you go about it. When you use the (LocalDB) instance I find this is the best route. Giving control to your solution means you can fully rebuild the db from sources along with your code project. When you have a seperate sql server instance that is shared for testing or prod then of course you don't want to be trashing it. In this case VS can work out diffs on your DB and generate ALTER if you want. Edit: latest vs database tools can also do data compare diff/merge as well as schema diff/merge It's a powerful approach. To do this add a sql server database project to your solution, then add a database reference to your code project. A lot of new stuff will become available not the least debugging of sql code! But all that said, first learn about database attach/detach operations, online/offline and add/delete from ssms.

AI is hard. Very hard. There's a ted talk by a neuroscientist who describes the left brain as a serial processor and the right brain as a parallel processor. Highly recommended (although slightly off topic). http://youtu.be/UyyjU8fzEYU I think the way we try to model AI is fundamentally flawed, although very useful in some limited scopes. To produce a generalized thinking machine we need to understand a lot more about biology and quantum effects in the brain.
Success at last. I managed to bring the database back online in Visual Studio. Thanks very much for your help phunkygeeza.
This is the way most socket and connection issues are resolved. Make a connect function that you call when you get an exception and handle retry logic in here. This way you can call the same function at initialisation etc.
thanks for reply! right now i don't know how to make program run every hour. Do i need to rewrite my console application to ASP.net or use something like CRON? Wich type of hosting will simplify this task?
You can use Windows Task Scheduler to execute your console application every hour
Monkey.Robotics ?
As far as I know, no _official_ way of doing so. There are [a few 3rd party utilities](https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=metro+apps+in+a+window) that let you do this. I haven't used any so, good luck experimenting! I believe in Windows 10, running metro apps in desktop windowed mode will be a native feature. Also in the future, you may want to try more a relevant subreddit like /r/windows
Thank you. https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/576122
As sextagrammaton mention, you can use the Task Scheduler for this. I expect you to get a Windows Server with/or an SQL server for the database stuff, which means you can use the same server for everything. Otherwise, you can look into Azure. They also have a task scheduler. It could aslo make it easier for you to sort out the hosting parts. There are tons of information if you just search a bit regarding the task scheduler, so check it out!
First, take a look at this SO post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13429129/task-vs-thread-differences If you have any more questions, please ask.
I guess its not for everyone. But I use visual studio online. Its free too for 5 users. 
Yes, both snippets do essentially the same thing in that they run code on a ~~thread-pool~~ thread. (ok, not a thread-pool thread, but a different one from where it's called anyway) Everyone seems to be moving towards using Tasks/Async/Await (eg. HttpClient). I would recommend it since it keeps synchronisations contexts in WPF/ASP.NET projects easy to manage and makes asynchronous code much easier to follow. NB. Using tasks/async/await doesn't necessarily run code on a threadpool thread, however, but since you used Task.Run(), your Work will be run on a thread-pool thread.
Grab a C# book and learn some C# first, please. Then you'll understand what that error is telling you... `availableRooms` and `currentRooms` are most likely both `null` when you access them.
