Hi all, I am the developer who started the ImageSharp library and it's really good to see a vigorous dialogue surrounding our decision, a little negative for my tastes, but hey, them's the breaks. I made a mistake when I published the original blog post and omitted some vitally important text (closed the tab by accident when composing, thought it was saved) regarding the license changes. I've updated the post but I'll comment here also. The commercial license model we are considering has two paths. 1. A subscription license, per developer, per year with unlimited usage. This would be renewable for a maximum of 3 years before you automatically receive a perpetual license for unlimited developers and usage. 2. A one time payment to receive an perpetual license for unlimited developers and usage. We will offer free commercial licenses for not-for-profit organizations and cheap licenses for indie developers. As I said in the post, we're gonna be cheap, almost painfully so, in order to hopefully not drive away users. We're talking less than most people would spend on coffee per year. We didn't make this decision lightly. In a perfect world we would get corporate sponsorship and continue with the license we have but that simply does not seem to be on the radar. Over the last few years we have been gratefully accepting donations from a generous few totalling up to $3,515.61. I'm sure you would agree that this isn't enough for us to continue to dedicate the time and resources to continue to maintain the library; graphics libraries are a very difficult subject to tackle and require a lot of intensive study to develop and maintain. If you want to change this situation, please help there. [https://opencollective.com/imagesharp](https://opencollective.com/imagesharp) Cheers James &amp;#x200B;
Tiff support is coming and our jpeg decoder is much better now than it used to be. https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/tree/tiff-codec
See my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ajsbzx/imagesharp_are_switching_to_nonpermissive_licenses/eezdth4/)
&gt; PrincipalContext(ContextType.Machine); That looks right to me. But I admit that AD code gives me a headache. 
I have two questions 1. Is it OK with you if the community tries to create some noise around this in an attempt to get some corporation to notice? 2. I guess you have thought about it but are you OK with some mixed mode thing. Keeping the core library free but selling additional features in side libraries. I think ImageResizer.NET functioned this way.
1. Absolutely ok with that, make as much noise as you like. 2. We could potentially extract out some of the extension functionality into separate libraries and have a Core ImageSharp product, but it would be difficult determining where to draw the line. I'd have to discuss that with the team. 
We spoke about it a lot in our gitter channel. 
/u/grauenwolf maybe an article on the subject would help raising awareness? Also any volunteers to spread the thing on twitter during the work week and tag some community figures?
If you go into your windows event viewer and look under application are there any errors it’s giving you there? That might be the best place to start since it just crashing could be a million things. 
Hi selfwalkingdog, Thanks for commenting! I build the entire system from scratch using C# for the backend and javascript / jQuery in the frontend ( obviously I used some existing opensource libraries, but had to write all the code to have it talk to the backend system ) The very first time i built it i used the telerik controls, however since I wanted to make the CMS open source I had to re-build the entire CMS including all the widgets from scratch using jquery. I even built a custom template parser with custom "ShortCodes" to interact with the backend System / CMS, which in-conjunction with the Razor Engine runtime compiler provides a level of flexibility not seen in many CMS's out there. One of the best features is the ability to create fields in the CMS and then pull it in to the HTML by using a ShortCode ( {Field:\[FieldCode\]} ) and / or write Razor Code ( C# ) and have it update the frontend of the site right away without any build process. Instead of programming directly in the CMS you can use an include ShortCode "{IncludeFile:'\[Path-To-File\]'}" which allows you to load a cshtml file, which will be executed at runtime, without any build process, kinda makes your workflow similar to PHP, simply make your change and refresh the page. Thanks again for your comment!
Had to do a bit of poking as its been a while. You are missing a step, your application does have the context of the user the application is running under but you have to call it out using the correct API call first and then act as that user. var user = System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent(); Once you have the running user's identity you should be able to do operations as that user such as see what groups they are a member of (assuming they have that access). Your queries to look up groups is going to be different depending on if they are an AD or local user. Have you looked at any of the docs on MSDN yet, they cover most of this but its not the easiest to grok. I usually end up using a combination of that and samples scattered about. 
We are getting Error 1168. That is the only error it is giving me.
Define good? 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

My dream is Avalon. It fixes many of the bad design decisions that we have in WPF.
Have you gained consensus among your 66 contributors regarding the relicensing? In lieu of a contributor license agreement, which I could not find in your repo, the [inbound = outbound](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) rule applies which makes relicensing [difficult](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1620). The reality is that you no longer hold the exclusive copyright to this work and are therefore not entitled to change the license wholly without consensus among the 65 remaining copyright holders. To proceed as stated you'll need to "carve out" parts of the software for which you can gain consensus among copyright holders, which should be fairly easy as most of your contributions are distributed among a small number of people.
I wrestled with it a long time today. Old way I did it was much simpler but when machines had trust issues it would fail. Boss man wants it to work regardless since it’s a local group so I gotta make it happen. 
Perhaps I'm missing something. I don't see anything about a license change.
Truthfully no msdn. Just hodgepodge of stack overflow and trial / error. I’ll add in what your doing and see how it shakes out. I basically need to always checks. A local group for current user .. which may be local or domain. 
Every time I touch AD its like that. The code will appear to work, then break because some machine has a weird configuration. All I can offer is my condolences and wish you good luck.
you don't need to pay for MSDN to use the resource, their doc base has always been public. 
Here is a video with step by step instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGCuYwVzPFM Even though the title says VS2015, I have used it successfully in multiple projects to create MSI installers from Visual studio 2017, for my windows forms projects.

There’s a CLA that appears and requires signing when someone creates a PR. 
bookmarked that, thanks!
hah....glad I'm not alone in my struggles :) Mind sharing where you're at in your career w/programming? I'd say I just wrapped up my first year of somewhat knowing what the heck I'm doing. I did IT for about 8 years and got into scripting and some light python stuff. That led me to make a utility for work, which more or less got me my gig as a software engineer. I re wrote python thing in C# and now focus on writing in VB / C# on a daily basis. I absolutely love the field but feel like I'm way behind the ball being 33 and not having nearly as much experience as others in field
I can see it now after some digging. You should be good to go. You might want to place a copy of the CLA in your .github directory or link it from your contribution guidelines.
I started working professionally in 1997. So sorry, AD doesn't get any easier.
P.S. Have you ever noticed that all of the jobs ask for "5 years of experience" in a given technology? That's not a coincidence. If you don't know what you're doing by year 5, you'll never learn. And by year 6, we'll all have moved on to the next thing. Here's a quote by Bill Gates, &gt; Bill Gates: No. I think after the first three or four years, it's pretty cast in concrete whether you're a good programmer or not. After a few more years, you may know more about managing large projects and personalities, but after three or four years, it's clear what you're going to be. There's no one at Microsoft who was just kind of mediocre for a couple of years, and then just out of the blue started optimizing everything in sight. I can talk to somebody about a program that he's written and know right away whether he's really a good programmer. Most of what I know is worthless now because the technologies are no longer in use. But those foundational skills I learned in my first 5 years are still used every day. 
The blog announcement says specifically that donations don't pay the bills. https://sixlabors.com/blog/beta-six-labors/
I find it extremely funny that WPF supports Windows 7, 8 and 10 while UWP (which means Universal Windows Platform) supports just Windows 10. Very "universal"!
Here's the relevant blog post: https://sixlabors.com/blog/beta-six-labors/#licensing-plans
Why do you think you're entitled to other people's hard work? If your own project is open source, there is virtually no change and if you don't ever operationalize your project (e.g. just personal stuff), you aren't even bound by the license. The only case where you pay for a license is closed source software. Whether commercial or non-commercial your closed source project is taking from the community and giving nothing back, I have a hard time finding sympathy for that.
thanks for both replies man. I work with a guy that is clearly the most talented dev at our site. He came from out west and has worked for some major companies. Talking to him gives me legit terror about working anywhere else. I've typically done pretty well in the IT field but most of that comes from just being an easy person to work with and willing to keep trying stuff until something works. At my current gig I can still kind of ride my own coat tails for doing fairly well in the IT world. IF i were to go anywhere else I'd have to stand on my programming legs alone and I'm just not that confident. It's awesome to run into someone that's been doing this for as long as you have. I hope the careers treated you well and again thanks for the input!
So what's to stop people from creating a fork based on today's Apache licensed version? Are there any current contributors who are considering that option? 
Thank you.
With JPEG I meant the format itself, not ImageSharp's usage of it. We needed pyramids, compressions formats, and embedded clipping paths.
There are a few like SkiaSharp, Cairo, OpenGL/Nanovg, and so forth. I am now forking off ImageSharp and plan on reorganizing the project to maintain Apache 2.0 Licensing.
Ah right, sorry I misread. 
I severely dislike you, lol
People like you are the reason we’re having to change the license. Good luck supporting it. 
I’ll explain. You are so unwilling to support the current developer community i.e the project you should not try to build your own. 
You can't retroactively withdraw the version with Apache 2.0 licensing for previous versions and I plan on continuing the aforementioned Apache 2.0 licensing on this fork. And I have no problem supporting this project with my experience and expertise, I have worked across developing compilers, P/Invoke wrapper tools, transpiler, writing a book, taught various students on graphic programming and low level programming. If my action frustrate you, then you need to realize that this license change have consequences for people like me and you shouldn't blame me for taking steps to work around it. Have a good evening, James.
Feel free to laugh at me, but wouldn't it be easier to just use input.ToUpper() or input.ToLower() to make life easier, then compare this to a single "SELECT" OR "select" statement? Or am I missing an important point here?
There is lambda like syntax all over C# now, but it’s not a lambda i.e it’s not turned into a delegate instantiation (or expression tree) by the compiler. 
I don't see a problem here. If you're doing open source, use it. If you're profiting from closed source, pay a little. As he said he's "offering a one-time alternate perpetual license that would be unlimited for both developers and usage." This all seems very reasonable. We should be aware of our entitlement. It's fun and easy to just "nuget install someones-hard-work" and it makes our app biggest faster stronger. But it's reasonable to pay \*and value\* things that provide value.
&gt; Is there any other tips you would give, generally speaking, when using reference types as Keys? Yeah... don’t. It’s generally not a good idea, at least unless your class is immutable. 
&gt; There is nothing wrong with using reference types as keys There kinda is, if they are mutable. You can break the dictionary by accidentally changing a field. 
Async main just creates a shadow main which GetAwaiter GetResults the main you write. 
You can, however, include various plugin executables that will run during installation and that can do things like copying and editing files. But MSI is pretty powerful on its own and can for instance construct ini style settings files on the fly. 
Be aware, the RazorEngine library is basically unmaintained and has 100+ open issues. Could you compare this CMS to Umbraco?
I don't because we still consider .NET Core work in progress. My employer still uses the policy Windows software, .NET Framework, UNIX/Windows software, Java. And we aren't planning to change until everything we use on .NET Framework is able to run on top of .NET Core.
Great! What address should I send my household bills to? 
You already put out a version that you worked on for free via Apache License 2.0, you should have considered that forking off your work is entirely possible under that license and that license cannot be retracted on the version that you distributed with that license. On the plus side, you don't have any obligation to work on my fork and thus neither of us owe each others anything. Thank you for working on ImageSharp project, I really appreciate your effort on this project. Again, have a good evening, James.
Glad you found it useful. 
Yeah Electron, fuck your users! Who cares about UX..../s
Meh, it'll be fine. We just need to fork ImageSharp.
&gt; I have a perception that you can do more with a smaller memory footprint in WPF. LOL. By smaller you mean 300kb vs 1,4 GB ?
This obsession of remaining compatible with pirated Windows 7 boxes in China gives so much laughter. Enterprise is one thing, but then you have a customer, not statistics of installs.
Fuck Middlewares, get proper engineers.
wat? Smoke less please.
That's because you're expecting a "mobile" app to be a 1990's piece of software, with root access, unlimited CPU time and 200GB of hard disk just for you. The "mobile" development model is here to come, and for good reason. 
Never make public software. Keep your web-slow-disgusting-nonaccessible web shit out of the real world. I know, add even more layers. My record is 500 ms from typing a key to text appearing on screen.
Web people don't understand extension and expansion. Either you have a stupid language that CAN'T protect you from yourself, or you have a 30 layers frameworks on top of that shit. There is no solid framework to extend the base classes and add custom functionality. All you have is more dependencies. 
So telling facts is related to smoking in this subreddit? XD
You could write using (var db1 = new DbContext1()) using (var db2 = new DbContext2()) { } So you don’t have to indent twice. But world only if you don’t have to do anything between :)
“Enterprise” software mate, if only I could hah. Fucking lines of garbage.
It would be easier for sure. The whole thing is absurd though, not only the array of "special cases"
Shoot.... an acqui-hire to their . Net core team seems like a reasonable option. I wonder if the old Apache 2 license scared them off.
You, I like you.
Just because something isn't open source, doesn't mean it can't be freeware.
When you do, I'd like to get it. 
Excellent idea! I tweeted at 2 people from the .NET Foundation I heard on DotNetRocks a few weeks ago. Grassroots! https://twitter.com/Zombittack/status/1089150363880558592 
oh frick oh god
So I would use a service like twilio. It abstracts sending emails a little, adds some tracking, and I believe you can provide it a hook it will call with responses.
My word I have developed that people actually interpret correctly. One day it will be added to the dictionary.... one day.
Removed: Rule 3.
Yeah it got removed from the post I linked. It was there initially.
Nobody in the gitter chat talks about it and this library is not your everyday ASP.NET Web API stuff. My guess is that relatively few .NET devs have the required skills to maintain this library.
My personal problem is not the price of the library (although who knows, the price is not announced yet). I simply don't want to think about the legal consequences of adding the library into the project, I don't want to have to discuss it with people on the team and so on. As I see it Microsoft or other corporation in the .NET ecosystem can sponsor the development simply to reduce the amount of issues working with .NET.
There are good reasons to consider .NET Core work in progress and not migrate yet, but even if you don't have this problem today you'll probably have it in the future.
The problem with getting the place you work at to pay for something is not simply the money you will pay. It is the hoops you have to jump through. This is why permissive licenses are so popular.
Ditto on either this or Amazon SNS. I've had very poor results in running email integration with Gmail even with all of the restrictions removed. It would work in development but fail in production. 
I was thinking about some organized tweeting on Monday when people are at work with this link - https://sixlabors.com/blog/beta-six-labors/#licensing-plans
I use [postmarkapp.com](https://postmarkapp.com) for this. Sending emails from azure servers (and I assume aws etc..) hits the spam filter more often than not. There's integration for receiving webhooks when a user responds to the email too.
By saying Onion/Clean _versus_ MVP/MVC, you’re creating a false dichotomy. Onion is a way to structure an _application_. MVC is a way to structure a presentation layer — it’s one of the outer layers of a larger Onion application. In very, very simple apps, you might end up with a view model that matches the domain model that matches the persistence model. In general, though, as soon as you have validation for user input, you need to separate the presentation model (M in MVC) from the domain model because the presentation model also needs to have the ability to coherently present the error messages. For simple apps, your breakdown would be functional. My biggest concern, though, is that you should _never_ have business logic or make calls to the persistence layer/framework (EF context) from the controller. Going to SRP, the controller’s single responsibility to convert the presentation to/from something usable by the domain services/core.

Nice try, Stallman!
Lots of transactional mail services will do this for you, and provide a webhook/queue/serverless function for the incoming messages .. Amazon SES, SendInBlue, Mandrill, SendGrid, MailGun, Postmark. I'd hazard a guess that Amazon SES will be the cheapest, but if volume is low some offer free plans.
Yes, that is why I said "mostly". There are always exceptions to the rule.
Yes that is true indeed. But on the other hand, it isn't really fair for the developer to use is hard work to implement something and then not be allowed to monetize it just because some companies have too much bureaucracy. But I know that the world isn't black and white and (to me at least) looks like they are trying to balance keeping the library open source and still getting payed for their work and other expenses they might have. 
You should try out JetBrains Rider. MonoDevelop is basically dead since Microsoft bought it.
You named your library after the famous chat client?
I don't think "fair" has anything to do with it. Fair is what is in the license and they are thinking of changing it, that's fair. My point is that if say Microsoft wants to make .NET better for devs and companies using it they better pay these guys to work on the library than hire one more person for the Xamarin team or one more person for the ASP.NET team. Obviously this is an opinion based on my personal experience but I think high-quality image library is needed for all kinds of projects and benefits a very wide range of developers. With this post I am hoping a big company (MS or someone else) might step in to sponsor the project enough to keep at least the Core library under permissive license.
Thank you for the comments! &amp;#x200B; I have no experience **yet** with transactional email services but will look up what they are. &amp;#x200B; In the meantime I have found the [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) project and experimented with it a bit. &amp;#x200B; Both Smtp based send and Imap based message poll/filtering works when sending from and polling a gmail account. &amp;#x200B; At this point I am inclined to go with registering a gmail account for the web-app, and sending email via WebKit-SMTP and filtering incoming response-emails directed to the WebApps email address via WebKit-IMAP. &amp;#x200B; The mail traffic will be minimal, a few emails (1-2-3) to like 100 separate Invitee-email addresses. &amp;#x200B; Could somebody plz elaborate what the advantage of transactional email services are compared to the above described SMTP/IMAP approach? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
yep, God bless them. --written on my iPhone
I don't have experience with incoming emails, however if you would like to get your emails past the spam filters, you should use an email service rather than SmtpClient. Amazon SES is the cheapest, and perhaps the most painful to work with. You will have to comply with their rate limits, and you'll have to set up an endpoint to receive notifications of bounces and complaints, and the docs for doing so are extremely poor. SendGrid is more expensive but incredibly easy to use. Takes minutes, rather than hours, to configure.
It still does what I need. I have tried Rider and while it is a really good product, I can't spend money on it since I do smaller projects in it which doesn't require a full ide. Basic debugging is all I am after 
Head first C# - O’Reilly You build little games to learn programming. 
I have successfully used the official Gmail API to retrieve selected emails from my Gmail account from a C# program. [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet). I might be able to share code if that would be helpful.
This is the kind of shit I really enjoy! Very well written!
Udemy has several ways you could go about this. The Unity Engine uses C#, some of the beginner 2D things would be great and you would be learning two skills at once (Unity and C#.) The Brackeys channel on YouTube is another great way to learn Unity, and I believe he has a series of videos that is specifically for C# beginners if you want to avoid the Unity to start. 
i know it, but it is a bit old, its published in 2013 :( 
I wrote a CRM system that handled tens of thousands of messages and emails a day. It was a fucking nightmare. Like other people have said, I'd recommend going with a pre-canned solution and using their API.
The principles haven’t changed, just the tools that are available. You’ll learn about the tools more as you learn the foundation. Don’t get caught up too much in the latest and greatest. Many people have seen success learning from this series and I reference this book all the time to remember certain explanations that are provided.
Thanks bro, i will check it :)
I would recommend attempting to contribute to https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore Find some feature you think it should have and create it. Working on the framework itself will really set you up for your future.
every two digit numbers\*
do you mean Head first C#? :D 
you are right thanks, i will check it :D 
If you want to move the first number to the last position you could convert the two digit number to a string and then swap the chars.
James removed it because the information in the release notes was outdated. Now I have added a link to our blog post at the end.
You could do something with AWS and make a serverless app with C#. You can do a lot with the free tier. 
Yeah, but i don't need it in char , i need it in a real number tp make some calculations after
 int SwapDigits(int i) { if (Math.Abs(i) is var tmp &amp;&amp; (tmp &lt; 10 || tmp &gt; 99)) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(); // or don't. Depends what your use case is } var a = Math.DivRem(i, 10, out var b); return (b * 10) + a; } 
I would use reflection for that problem.
Removed: Rule 4. use `string s = number.ToString()` to convert to a string, then you can pull out each digit using `s[0]` and `s[1]`. Finally, you can combine them back in reverse order and use `Int32.Parse` to convert them back to an `int`.
You can convert an char back to an int, but when I am looking at comment below this looks much more mathmatically correct :-)
Developer response here: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ajsbzx/imagesharp_are_switching_to_nonpermissive_licenses/eezdth4/
What about something that takes source code from one language and converts it into c#? 
As people have explained, the licensing they're proposing is fundamentally incompatible with certain projects. Many companies have policies against using anything without a permissive license. .NET Core needs an imaging library you can use without involving your company's legal team.
I think the problem with this approach is that many companies have policies against using anything without a permissive license, regardless of how cheap it is, so you've left .NET Core without an imaging library for many developers. How do you plan on handling permissive forks from the current version?
Prefer statically typed objects 99.9% of the time. Use dynamic only if you're trying to support multiple extremely similar objects at one api endpoint (also not advisable but bosses gonna boss). If you still think you need this functionality, call and deserialize it into a specific object type using: `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;mytype&gt;(dynamicObject.ToString())`
I’d love to see a new/updated modern RabbitMQ client with async as a first class citizen! https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client 
Some features are useful but many syntactic sugar changes begin to feel kind of pointless. I feel like there is a point of diminishing returns. I would consider myself a fairly average programmer. I use C# as a tool to make APIs, websites, simple libraries, etc. There is a point where the cost of remembering how things work exceeds the cost of helpfulness and I think we're beginning to reach that point. I could be wrong though. I do have a really bad memory after all.
Thanks, could be helpful. Did you use just the example code, or are other modifications needed?
How would this impact performance of the process you're recording?
I have suspicion that the donations might increase once the library loses the beta tag. Obviously not if they embrace the dual license.
You forgot Windows XP and Vista 
Sorry for offtopic! This is my new mindblow news app. I'm sure you haven't seen anything like this. Linkme: Feedster
Eventually, but then I will just pay for an ImageSharp license, because the developer's work is worth it.
Can you run WPF apps in Xbox One, IoT,ñ or phones? 
With the added benefit that it will work with a full version of SQL server should the need arises. 
my thoughts exactly, i was like OMG did they resume the project and launch a new version?! no, disappointment...
How does that work? Presumably there's a gatekeeper who looks at a contribution and says "Nah, we're not doing that", or OKs it?! I have extension methods that I think everyone would use, e.g. string.ToInt(). Does AspNetCore include extension methods? Could I add it as a native method?
What about SkiaSharp?
We have been using resharper at work for several years and I was also using it at home but over the past few releases VS performance has and continues to tank when used with resharper. I installed a 30 day trial of CodeRush for home and while not as feature rich as R# it is, for me, lightning fast and has the functionality I use on a day to day basis. I bought a license for $49. We still use R# at work but it is painful. Oddly enough their stand alone IDE Rider is wicked fast but a bit pricey for me to buy for home use.
Uhh. IT is a fast-moving field. The lesson to take from that is not “I shall only learn the latest and greatest”, but rather “I shall teach myself to be highly-adaptive to ever-changing technologies”. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if the book is, gasp, six years old. Nor does it even really matter which language it is (you probably shouldn’t start with COBOL, though).
Bullfuck. So much misinformation in this thread. UWP is a cancer and all the hate it gets is completely justified. The strawman argument people use is Windows 10, but that's not the problem with UWP. The problem with UWP isn't that it only works on Windows 10. It's that it's a less capable API than the one that was there before. WPF was fine because it could do everything WinForms did and more. UWP is not fine because it can't everything WPF could do. Look at this C# program: https://zdoom.org/wiki/Doom_Launcher It lets you launch Doom giving you a GUI to select WADs and maps. I can't make that simple fucking program in UWP because it doesn't even let you use the win32 APIs needed to run programs. Fuck you Microsoft. The SIMPLEST fucking programs can't be created in this shitty new API. What's so offensive about it is that, if you read between the lines, what Microsoft and most of these shitty companies are actually trying to do is kill the desktop PC. They don't want you to be able to make launchers or shell replacements or anything actually productive because they want to turn computers into fucking cell phones that don't let you make anything for yourself so you have to pay THEM to get the real applications. Notice how none of the applications that are actually important (Visual Studio, SQL Management Studio, etc.) use UWP. It's BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T WORK. The other thing that irritates me to no end is idiots who say that UWP is so much better/more updated than win32. UWP fucking uses win32 behind the scenes. Everything on Windows is ultimately win32. It's the base API that everything ultimately uses. FUCK UWP. Release an API that lets me do as much as I could do before or fuck off and die.
Yes, gate keepers. Are your extension methods specific to asp ?
&gt; Are your extension methods specific to asp ? Oh, probably not.
As I’ve explained but you’ve obviously not read. We’re adding exceptions to bundle alongside open source projects with permissive licenses. If a company has a policy policy against using it then that would indicate to me they are happy consuming but not contributing back. They shouldn’t need to involve a legal team, just put their hand in their pocket and pay for something that is worth paying for. 
I'm not sure if you've never worked for a big company or corporation, but that isn't how it works. It's not about the money, it's about adding massive complexity to something that use to be a few clicks in Nuget.
&gt; that a switch is a block of limited goto labels, But in this case it isn't. It (very likely?) compiles down to a series of if-else.
Shouldn't even be on you to promise that. An enum is a clearly defined set of labels. The compiler shouldn't be forbidding code that doesn't handle cases explicitly not part of the definition of the enum. That's interface-leaking, IMHO.
very cool project. congrats on the .0 release!
Companies should learn to pay for projects they profit from. Developers should encourage their employers to be good citizens. How do I plan on handling Beta6 forks? I find the idea distasteful of course (copying someone’s hard work because for some self entitled reason you don’t them to use their efforts to provide for their families) but there’s nothing I can do to stop them. I’ll be surprised though if they last any time to be honest. In 3+ years we’ve had 66 (I think) contributors; that’s really small consider it’s a well known library with nearly 3K stars. Developing a library of this complexity takes a lot of time, a lot of specific domain knowledge, and a lot of skill. I’ve personally spent 1000s of hours working on the code, burning the candle at both ends, my evenings and weekends dominated all in the while promising my incredibly supportive wife that one day it will be worth it. I’m not all that sure individuals who want to fork it appreciate fully what they are taking on. Beta6 is in great shape but it’s unfinished, we know where the kinks are, others will have to discover them. 
In you experience... I have worked for big companies and in mine they’ve paid for some and chosen not to use others. Depends on the library and use case. 
Sure, companies like Microsoft and Amazon and Google should make it easier for their devs to pay for the software that they need. But that isn't the reality we live in, no matter how much I personally want to support the project. In addition, there's nothing wrong with wanting to get paid for your work, but changing licenses right before the release of 1.0 comes across as extremely underhanded. It feels like a bait and switch, regardless of your intentions.
But if I just want to encode a PNG. Looping in the legal team and PM team and the people responsible for purchasing licenses and having meetings about your dual license isn't as easy as clicking a few buttons in Nuget.
Murach's C# 2005 is another good option.
I would recommend what someone else in this thread recommended. Have a core library for simple image functions with a permissive license and put advanced features in the dual license.
basic implementation of extension properties var name = string. Empty; name.Props().CreatedDate = DateTime.Now; // a few lines later.. if (name.Props().CreatedDate.Year &gt; 2000) { } 
Nice write-up! Have never realised that you could use extension methods on enums. Removes the need for helper class anti patterns 👍
The medical world is always in need for software solutions, though it might be a little hard to get into without a semi-medical background
Yes, it's incredibly helpful! I also use an extension method to get enum's display name (e.g. when showing in UI).
Interesting. Is `Props()` returning a `dynamic` object?
&gt; so you've left .NET Core without an imaging library for many developers. It is not his job to make sure .NET Core has a good image library. If anyone should take care for this it is Microsoft.
Good article. I have seen the pattern of attaching extension methods to interfaces before, and it works well. You can keep the implementation compact, will supplying common overloads and helpers for all of them.
Nice, thanks for posting. I didn’t know that extension methods could be written for enums. 
Indeed it isn't. However, ImageSharp reduced the pressure to create one because one already existed. If ImageSharp didn't have a permissive license from it's inception, then there would likely be more competition in this space. There's nothing wrong with wanting to make money, but their license should have reflected their intention from day 1.
It is not dynamic, Props is an extension method. I'm not in the office, but I'll share my implementation.
Now the pressure is back and there is quite good codebase which can be forked if the pressure is enough. However I really believe MS should pay them. I mean the pressure is mainly on MS isn't it?
In f# you can create extension methods with generics and constrain it to enums. 
I don't disagree with that. I like ImageSharp. If they want money they should have money. My only issue is with swapping licensing right before release. It makes it seems like they were being intentionally underhanded.
I normally avoid base classes when I can but i would much prefer them to extension methods for an interface for new code. I can appreciate the utility for legacy code, however.
Starting with C# 7.3 generics can be constrained to enums.
are these solutions related to computer vision? please elaborate. 
Sure, it's my field. Some aspects will be related to computer vision and/or image processing. Lots and lots of research is being put into getting computers to nearly diagnose you based off of a few scans. Hospitals also have an inordinate amount of administrative work that needs to be handled. Big software companies tackle these with Hospital Information Systems (HIS). An example of such a business in the US would be Epic. A third example of software in a hospital would be getting information to the patients and visitors and how you do that safely If it concerns PII. But it could also be as benign as showing how long a wait you have in the ER based on current occupancy and triage codes. All of these could be things to look into, if your college/university has a medical faculty, you could possibly shoot them a message. 
Even if it was their intention (which frankly I doubt) it is still fair game.
Really? I didn't know it, that's great. 
You can use the api as others have suggested, also check out selenium if the api doesn't cut it.
This looks really cool
Nice! I've used attributes for that on the enum values but I can see extension methods useful for that too.
It's really difficult to gather what your code is doing from that rough description.
This is what we used In our first programming class in college [book link](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Problem-Analysis-Program-Design-ebook/dp/B00C1UN5KY) It will teach you everything you need to get started. From data types, escape characters to SQL, interfaces (I think that’s what they’re called). Hell, it even teaches you how to start analyzing a programming problem. Probably one of the best $200 I spent. 
sir simply have to display data from database in that tables if it greater the 14 rows data must shift to new tables means sequence wise 15 to onward. 
But then you run into the lovely anti pattern of large shuns with dozens of switch case extension methods :)
Hi imdrunkwhyustillugly, Thanks for your comment! I will see if i can find any alternatives to the RazorEngine library, if you have any suggestions, please let me know. The only time i looked into the Umbraco features was prior to me building this CMS, at that time Umbraco did not provide the flexibility that I was looking for in a CMS, hence my decisions to build this CMS. You can look over the CMS guide, hopefully this can give you an idea about how the CMS functions: [https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS/raw/master/WebApplication/Admin/media/docs/FlexDotnetCMSGuide.docx](https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS/raw/master/WebApplication/Admin/media/docs/FlexDotnetCMSGuide.docx) Thanks! &amp;#x200B;
Always the pessimist huh? 😉 To solve that just (re)introduce physical punishment to those morons that add to enums without any thought...
Are you upset
&gt; Whether commercial or non-commercial your closed source project is taking from the community and giving nothing back I'm guessing you don't know how open source software tends to work. How do you think thousands of other MIT Licensed (and similar) projects are still running? The general expectation is that the community uses them for free, and contributes in return. Or in some cases, foundations are developed which offer "enterprise" level support which help fund the project or large corporations sponsor it. &amp;#x200B; Based on your logic, we should be paying just for the privilege of using C# itself because people have put hard work into it. &amp;#x200B; These guys have every right to commercialize the code they have spent time on. I guess I'm just disappointed that c# no longer has any viable image manipulation support that is free to use. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm surprised that Avalonia (https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) hasn't been mentioned. There are differences compared to WPF but the advantage is that Avalonia is open source and cross platform; I would say that, with the active development it has, it's a safe bet for the future (it is only at version 0.7 but it's considered stable enough for production).
&gt; but their license should have reflected their intention from day 1. I agree. These guys definitely deserve money for their hard work, but I don't like the whole bait &amp; switch thing. They should have made it very clear on the Git Repo that this was intended to be a commercial product after launch so users could more accurately weigh their options. This might have encouraged more competition libraries that were actually free to use. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Hi! I am someone who works for a giant corporation with very conservative and often meaningless policies .... ... and also an ImageSharp core contributor. (The one who's usually working on the hardcore memory and optimization stuff.) On one hand, I sympathize with the idea of permissive OSS with all my hearth, because I know what it means to use OSS in large corporations. On the other hand, I know for sure this is not the way to turn ImageSharp into a sustainable project, and I will never be able to leave world of those idiotic companies. I also believed in the idea of having a permissive core for a while, even tried to convince James about it. But I had to realize this does not work. We need to charge for simple common use cases as well, or the money will be insufficient to maintain the project. The only sustainable solution to make both sides happy is to get funding from Microsoft.
&gt;Companies should learn to pay for projects they profit from This seems to go against the open source philosophy to me. There are lots behemoth projects like MySQL, Postgres, C# itself, that companies are making millions off of without paying a dime, and almost every other programming language has some variant of open source image manipulation libraries. &amp;#x200B; I have no problem with someone building a commercial library. You absolutely deserve to be paid for you work if you choose to. What I find a bit distasteful is that this project wasn't clearly advertised as being a commercial product, which a) builds up users who invest time implementing the project into their products, then suddenly they are asked to pay, and b) potentially weeding out any competition. People wouldn't see the need to start an actually free open source library. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. The library is still open source and the Free part of FOSS means free movement not fiscally free.
Ummm… time to get off the meds? lol. Seriously go have a beer or something. Peace.
I'm using the following almost everywhere: public static class ________________________________NumberExtensionMethods { [MethodImpl(256)] public static byte Clamped (this byte value, byte min, byte max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static sbyte Clamped (this sbyte value, sbyte min, sbyte max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static short Clamped (this short value, short min, short max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static ushort Clamped (this ushort value, ushort min, ushort max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static int Clamped (this int value, int min, int max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static uint Clamped (this uint value, uint min, uint max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static long Clamped (this long value, long min, long max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static ulong Clamped (this ulong value, ulong min, ulong max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static float Clamped (this float value, float min, float max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } [MethodImpl(256)] public static double Clamped (this double value, double min, double max) { return Math.Min(max, Math.Max(value, min)); } }
An enum extension initially sounds very useful, but the fact that it has to be defined in a top level static class can be a dealbreaker in many cases.
I think lots of people start w/ the yellow book. http://www.csharpcourse.com It is a legit college course and free.
If you use generics, your enum extension methods can also work for a range of enums too, for framework libraries
&gt;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ why 500 underscores?
Sadly only works with reference types
My IDE is not smart enough to hide the class from the autocomplete suggestions. With the underscores I immediately know the result is not relevant.
Came to say this. .GetDisplayName() FTW
Man, extension methods ..I just have. Mixed feelings. 
&gt; This seems to go against the open source philosophy to me. It's released under an OSI approved license. This is not a matter of opinion. If your projects are incompatible with AGPL, *you* are the one going against the open source/free software philosophy. But don't take my word for it, Richard Stallman is the expert: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html
I think they understand that FOSS means free as in freedom, not free as in beer. But what they have a problem with is a library being positioned as FOSS with a \*permissive\* licence, and then experiencing a bait and switch when the library is suddenly taken non-permissive years later, after the community has trusted it to be a permissive open source library. Also, I've been reading your other comments here since this announcement and if I were you I would take a step back from the keyboard and think before you post these things. I don't mean that in a threatening way, and I genuinely understand your perspective with the work you've done on the library, but you should try to understand the perspective of the users here. The way you're acting towards people here is unprofessional and frankly, embarrassing. It was enough for me to cancel my monthly OpenCollective donation. You're obviously a competent, hard worker, and you deserve better than what you're setting yourself up for by acting this way here.
I'm fully aware that open source doesn't automatically equal free financially. I was just providing counter examples to your claim that "Companies should learn to pay for projects they profit from" since there are thousands of example of companies using free software, and people willing to maintain it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just important to remember, from the moment you add your 2nd extension method, think hard about if you instead maybe want a class and get instances of it via enums.
Cool i have that one too. You can also use IComparable instead of overloading for each type
Why? Can you elaborate what those cases are?
Private enums inside classes/structs cannot be extended like that.
I've specifically typed out every type, since there are only 8 and it provides the best performance.
I started with yellow book, it is indeed great book, would recommend it.
I reprogrammed your program but made it much shorter because it is easier to find problems if you don't have to look through 543523 lines of similar, repeating code that may have copy and paste mistakes in it (and we don't even have the entire code). Maybe if you try to tighten things up, the error gets more obvious while debugging or disappears entirely. But it should be much easier to find it for sure. &amp;#x200B; Code suggestion, read comments for explanations and/or feel free to ask: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Data; using System.Drawing; using System.Linq; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.IO; namespace WindowsFormsApp5 { public partial class Form1 : Form { private PictureBox[] _cards; private int _cardsValue; private Image[] _cardImages; private int _cardCounter; private Random _rand; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); //init stuff _rand = new Random(); _cardCounter = 0; //store picboxes in array to avoid repeated code and allow access via array indexer //through _cardCounter (many lines of code saved) _cards = new[] { picboxCardOne, picboxCardTwo, picboxCardThree, picboxCardFour, picboxCardFive, }; //ignore Array.ForEach(_cards, c =&gt; c.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom); //gets all card pictures, mine were out of order cause "10s" was lower than eg "2H", //this caused a bug were a 10 were displayed, but a 2 was added.. maybe your pictures are just out of order, too //p.s quick hack, not supposed to be elegant (ignore implementation details) IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; files = Directory .GetFiles(@"..\Cards") .OrderBy(x =&gt; Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(x).Length &gt; 2 ? Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(x) : "0" + Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(x) ); //convert file paths to images (ignore) _cardImages = files .Select(Image.FromFile) .ToArray(); } private void btnDraw_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { //because we use _cardCounter as index, we risk an IndexOutOfRangeException, we want to assure thats not the case if (_cardCounter &gt;= _cards.Length) return; //random index 0-52, i don't get the 2-52 you did, but you get the point int index = _rand.Next(_cardImages.Length); //ez access of picboxes via _cardCounter _cards[_cardCounter].Image = _cardImages[index]; //index is 0-based, 4 cards per value, starting value is 2 //example: values of 2 have indizes 0,1,2,3 divided by 4 they are all 0 (integer woho) + 2 is 2 and so on (many lines saved) int value = index / 4 + 2; _cardsValue += value; lblPlayerScore.Text += $"[index: {index}] +{value} =&gt; {_cardsValue}{Environment.NewLine}"; _cardCounter++; } } } &amp;#x200B; (Not sure if i understood what your program is supposed to do, but it shouldn't really matter, it's about implementation, not some details in the rules, i guess. Try to improve your program upon this example, but don't just copy&amp;paste it. At the end, it should still be yours, not mine :P)
I have an extension class written in .net standard that I have been writing for quite sometime now, I’m always adding to it, whenever I have a project on and come across something that I see fit for it, I will add it, Feel free to add your own to it :) https://github.com/andreweberle/.NET_Family-ExtensionHelper
Ah yeah, that's a good point
well, if you insist.. #define good
That looks like a neat project, but it would be much easier to browse and add to if you broke it up into many different files. Currently it's all in one 1400 line file, which is difficult to search through.
What would you suggest?
Excellent article, thank you for sharing. This one is a little obscure, but you can use extension methods to operate on references that are null. Consider the following[:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71VT6oTto1g) class IntString { public int i; public string s; public string Text() { if (this == null) return "null"; return $"{i}; {s}"; } } The check in `Text()` will never return true; if you try to call `Text()` on a reference of `IntString` that is null, it will throw a NullReferenceException. The following, on the other hand, works as expected: class IntString { public int i; public string s; } static class IntStringExtensions { public static string Text(this IntString item) { if (item == null) return "null"; return $"{item.i}; {item.s}"; } }
Have one file for each type that you extend. I.e. one file for string extensions, one file for int extensions, ect. Although looking through the repo, perhaps in your case it would be better to split them by function. One file for xml-related extensions, one file for currency-related extensions, ect.
Simply put, great article.
Thanks for that, that sounds like a good idea
Never thought about this case before. Does VS (or R#) warn about the first one? Surely it should know that this == null will always be false?
Brake it up into many different files.
His is one of the only things I don't like about extension methods. Calling a method on a null looks weird and could cause some nasty bugs. I would rather use object?.Method()
VS doesn't warn you. Don't know about resharper, I don't use it.
Like I said, it's obscure. Usually it's not good practice, but in some situations you can clean your code up a lot with it, eliminating tons of null checks.
Cheers :)
thanks bro i will check it
its sounds good thanks i will check it :D 
I think you should rewrite this using arrays. The code would be much simpler. Which would make it easier to find bugs 
Attributes can help alleviate this, but yeah, even then, it's an inelegant solution (under the surface. The code which uses it looks nice, though)
It goes further than that - many of the best applications of extension methods come when you wish to extend some type that you not have the appropriate access to, e.g. BCL types, or any other sealed type. 
Is there a particular reason you're not using the `=&gt;` operator?
Oh, another thing: you should use [this](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore) gitignore to avoid uploading stuff like the .vs folder, the bin folder and the obj folder.
Thanks again mate, I’ll certainly be adding your suggestions :)
Thank you!
Format it properly using a code block, or use pastebin, hastebin or GitHub gists 
Perhaps \#learnprogramming is what you want?
Example two somewhat grates me. This method belongs on the domain object, not hidden away in an extension method. Extending typically unextendable types does add value, though. 
I also had this talk with my coworker and he shares the same opinion as yours. I don't think there's right or wrong here (I wouldn't ask the person to change it during review), but I prefer the extension method approach because it keeps the model really clean and defines that line between what's *required* to function and what's just *nice shortcut*.
Great. This was new for me
I think you came to the wrong subreddit. This sub is for C# whereas your code looks like C++. Not a massive problem, someone might still be able to help you but just so you know for next time.
I don't know your language's syntax, but I am pretty sure one lined comments can be done with //
You can have the period right after the last word in the sentence. See. Like. This. Same for the comma, here it goes. As for your question: Do you control the web server?
I'm not familiar with HWID licenses but somewhere here probably is, however, it'll be helpful to know what platform you're targeting. E.g., .NET Core, mono, .NET classic, etc.
no its a payment service am using there api ,
I don't know the context or the security but almost always it's good not to have the password hard coded into the program itself.
You need to set the CORS header server side. A client can't tell the server to accept whatever origin. 
You have to end the sentence with a period! This. One. Not this one: ",". How about this? [https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain](https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain)
I have no idea why am getting downvote , any way i solved the problem , all i had to is make a bridge , some thing like this : - var proxy = '[https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/)'; var url = "api url"; &amp;#x200B; // GET SESSION ID $.ajax({ // crossOrigin: true, url: proxy + url, &amp;#x200B;
A couple of enum treats public static TEnum DefinedOr&lt;TEnum&gt;(this TEnum value, TEnum defaultValue) where TEnum : struct, Enum =&gt; Enum.IsDefined(typeof(TEnum), value) ? value : defaultValue; public static TEnum NextValue&lt;TEnum&gt;(this TEnum value) where TEnum : struct, Enum { if (!(Enum.GetValues(typeof(TEnum)) is TEnum[] values)) throw new ArgumentException(nameof(value)); var next = Array.IndexOf(values, value) + 1; return next &lt; values.Length ? values[next] : values[0]; } And this one is great when using lists of tuples (but it would be made even better with some variadic generics...) public static void Add&lt;T1, T2&gt;(this List&lt;(T1, T2)&gt; list, T1 item1, T2 item2) =&gt; list.Add((item1, item2)); 
I always make extension methods for overloads with variations with method’s parameters (default values, etc). I makes the implementation of the interface cleaner.
You can do something like this var table = 0; for(var row = 0; row &lt; datarows; row++){ if (row%14 == 0) table++; tables[table-1] = data[row%14]; } Where tables is the array of your tables. YMMV 
.NET framework
You need to use selected item ot selected item index property 
What's a helper class anti pattern?
If the server doesn't allow cross origin requests, you'll be unable to do what you're trying to do from a web browser. You need some kind of middle tier like PHP, .NET, or Node to proxy the request from your Javascript to the payment processor. 
I write my own domain-oriented extension methods to extend Linq- &amp;#x200B; `public class Employee`
&gt; I have no idea why am getting downvote , Because you're on a C# subreddit and asked a JavaScript question.
Oh fuck , i thought am on jquery channel , lol :D , i have hide the question , hope this stop the DV storm .
As stated above you can do this by creating a separate selectedStation property in your view model and then bind the selected item property in your xaml to that (either two way or one way if you want it to be read only). You can then set that property in your viewmodel to have it selected in your combo box. 
I write my own extension methods to extend LINQ with domain-oriented extensions. Here's a simple example; public class Employee { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get;set; } public ICollection&lt;Job&gt; Jobs { get; set; } = new HashSet&lt;Job&gt;(); } public static class EmployeesExtensions { public static IQueryable&lt;Employee&gt; WithJob(this IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt; source, string name) { // Using AsQueryable() allows the method to be used in both queries and object collections return jobs.AsQueryable().Where(e =&gt; e.Jobs.Any(j =&gt; j.Name == name)); } } So you can use it like this; `return dbContext.Employees.WithJob("Developer");`
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EventSystems.IPointerClickHandler.html If you look at the documentation, IPointerClickHandler is a interface that inherits from another interface, IEventSystemHandler. If you want to create a class that is called when the user clicks on it, you just need to implement the IPointerClickHandler. If you want an interface that extends the IPointerClickHandler, simply use inheritance and make your new Interface inherit from the IPointerClickHandler to add whichever functionality you want to the new interface. You can do that with the other unity interfaces too like IPointerDownHandler...
https://garywoodfine.com/get-c-classes-implementing-interface/
I was just using that as an example, I want to create an entirely new interface which doesn't extend from others.
What drugs are you on? 
Haha, I figured as much. Good luck man.
Functions aren’t called on classes, they’re called on objects which are instances of a class. If you want to call a specific method on every instance you probably want to have an event and connect to it. It will be the reverse of what you want in a way since the objects will need to connect to the event and you can’t force feed it. Or you can make a parent class that always connects to this event and calls the method on an inherited class. 
Kelsey is a crazy guy that should not be paid any attention to. Really. Inform yourself a little bit more about that guy.
Watch it again, but this time imagine him talking about himself.
Excellent job! I loved it and it left me wanting more from you. Keep up the great work!
Doesn't ToString() give you the display name?
Removed: Rule 3. Try giving /r/cpp_questions a shot.
Removed: Rule 3.
 for(i = 0; i &lt; aCollumn; i++){ for(j = 0; j &lt; bRow; j++) { for(n = 0; n &lt; aCollumn; n++){ product = matrixA[i][n] * matrixB[n][j]; sum += product; } matrixAB[i][j] = sum; sum = 0; } } Fairly sure your first loop should be going until `i &lt; aRow`, and your second one until `j &lt; bCollumn`. Try it with a 2 by 8 matrix and an 8 by 3 matrix. You should end up with a 2 by 3 matrix, but it will either be an index oyt of range error, or an 8 by 8 matrix you'll get.
Looks great. Thanks for sharing. I agree with the suggestion to break it up into files based on extended types. Also, this is likely a matter of preference but those extensions which attempt to perform an action and return a bool indicating success or failure would be more descriptive with “Try” prepended to the method name. Ex: TryCreatFile. 
Yes it does, but what it returns is rarely good enough to display to the user, e.g. it would return `OfficeWord` but I'd prefer `Office Word document` instead.
Thank you!
Fair enough.
Cool!
Glad you learned something from it :)
Rewrite your code and create a class called ‘Card’ with 2 properties: string value and Suit s (you can create and enum called “Suit”) Then create a Deck class which has an list of Card as a property. The deck class also has a private string[] called values which = [“1”, “2”, ....”J”, “Q”, “K”, “A”]. In a method “CreateDeck”, use nested for loops to loop over the suits and the values array. Create a new card with those values and add it to the card list. Your deck can also have a method called “PickCard” which handles random card selection for you. When your form is created, create a new deck. Then, when you are picking a card from the deck, simply check the value of the card. There is no need for using a hardcoded value when the index is between X and Y. I’d add code but I’m on mobile. Good luck! 
Read up about asymmetric encryption. Your apps will carry the public key. When customer send a HWID to you, just create a simple JSON with required info (HWID, license period, organization name, allowed features etc), encrypt it with the private key you held, serialize it to base64. Send the string to your customer. Your app will then accept the string, deserialize it, decrypt it using the public key it carry, and decide what to do. 
I don’t know much about squirrel but my guess is to make sure all your project dependencies (.DLLs) are included in your installation source location. This is usually the problem when “it works in the debugger but not outside” If it is instead an application error, you could wrap the code in a try catch and print the error to a text file just as a means of figuring out what’s wrong. But my guess is still missing references 
The extension methods are just syntax sugar for a helper class, so you really haven't avoided anything. 
Way more harm than good.
Excellent write up but the last example, I have mixed feelings about. I've only read it once and haven't really had the chance to give it a whole lot of thought but it feels like it's against the Interface Segregation principle of SOLID. 
Use reflection to find all implementors of the interface, instantiate them, then call your method on all of them.
One way I'd to register those classes to a class that executes then. The other is to scan the assembly for them https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26733/getting-all-types-that-implement-an-interface
It's a bit ugly, but this will work: Func&lt;int, int, int&gt; fn = (int value, int n) =&gt; value * n; return (Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;)(Delegate)fn;
probably using older version that doesn't support it yet
in Haskell its called "rigid type error". You have assertion "for any T..." but returns not any, but something more specific.
I'm not sure I can restrict it, because the `T` may come from a third party and I have no control of it. A the very least I need support all primitive types and several third-party structs. I haven't touched Haskell in a long time, but I could probably create a type class for this function and all the necessary implementations, then restrict `T` to this type class. But this solution is probably impossible in C#, because I don't know no way to implement an interface outside the class.
Combine DisplayAttribute with extension methods to simplify that task even further.
Joe Duffy didn't get singleton right. In the code snippet, there's the possibility of `MySingleton` class getting instantiated twice. Does it matter? Maybe; it depends on whether the constructor has relevant side-effects. (Yeah, it's a post about memory models, but still I'd argue it's not a true singleton if there's a possibility of the class getting instantiated multiple times.)
What about ThrowIfNull() ? Super handy for constructors. Instead of this._a = a ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(a)); You could simply do this._a = a.ThrowIfNull()
Tell that to Linq.
The same thing also works if you replace `Delegate` with `object`. I think using `object` is slightly better, because the same technique also works on types other than delegates. But it's definitely just a minor nitpick.
Good point.
Well, yes, the method is supposed to return a \`Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;\`, and yet you are trying to return all sorts of different things. I'm not sure what you're trying to go for here.
Thanks, this seems to work! I guess I'll use this approach if there is there no solution more idiomatic than this.
You should not. This made it compile but it's not the right way to solve your problem.
Cast the returns though object to make C# happy `(Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;)(object)`; the Jit will drop the casts. e.g. if (typeof(T) == typeof(ThirdPartyStruct)) { return (Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;)(object)((ThirdPartyStruct value, int n) =&gt; value.SomeCustomOperation(n)); } Though it sort of breaks compile time type checking; but C# doesn't take the `typeof(T)` check into account. 
As I mentioned in the post, I need to accept such a function in some other generic class: class SomeOtherClass&lt;T&gt; { public void Foo(...some data, Func&lt;T, int, T&gt; func = null) { // ... } } Note the `= null` for the last argument. I want to find the default function automatically if `null` is passed. If I disallow this, the class usage will become more difficult and verbose (it is a utility which is used in many different places). That's why I'm trying to find a matching method based on actual type.
Thanks, casting it to a more general type seems to work (`Delegate` works as well as `object`). I'm going with this olution for now, unless I find something more idiomatic.
I've provided an example of what I'm doing [in other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/akdbme/casting_a_nongeneric_lambda_to_a_generic_one/ef43h6g/). Does there exist a more idiomatic solution for this problem?
I prefer to use attributes on the enums. That way the string value is defined in place.
I'd go with `object` as its more of a pattern the Jit recognises and can remove; going via another type will likely cause it to type check for both casts. Example prior art: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Numerics/Vector.cs#L567-L580 
SiteCore charges a fortune for their .net based CMS and they don't even support some of the features your CMS does, such as seamless Razor support. Thanks for making this available to everyone.
There might be a way to make this work, assuming I understand your requirement correctly, but the reason it's difficult is because it's a bad design and you're using the wrong mechanism for the behavior you want. It would be much better to use inheritance for this kind of thing. If the assignment insists you use generics, then I guess you can just cast around it.
To be honest there are a few code smells here and feels a bit like over engineering. It's not clear what your intent is (long winded Func params w/ dynamic typing) so straight off, I'd be looking at how to KISS. Hard to say what a viable solution would be without more context but scraping the Func helper altogether (helpers are a major code smell) and try to encapsulate the logic(s) you need in a injectable service, that you could then create a clean, sematic interface for. 
Basically, in my actual code `SomeOtherClass` is a definition of animation for objects in my game, it's intended to be used and instantiated everywhere. Since *any* property of type `T` can theoretically be animated, I want to include default interpolation functions for common ones (`int`, `float`, `Vector3`, `Color`, ...) while still allowing the user to supply a custom interpolation function for types which are not supported by default (or for rare cases where the user wants to override the default behavior). So, I'm not really sure how to do this without typecasting and without making the class usage more verbose.
As I mentioned in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/akdbme/casting_a_nongeneric_lambda_to_a_generic_one/ef48x5p/), `SomeOtherClass` is used for defining animations in my game code. Since *any* property of type `T` can be animated, I want to provide default interpolation functions for primitive types (`float`, `int`, ...), third-party types (`Color`, `Vector3`, ...) and also allow the user to pass their own function if they want to animate a custom type.
Thanks, this is good to know!
Back when I wrote it my IDE didn't support C# version 6, but I also prefer having all my methods inside brackets for consistency.
It sounds like what you want is an IAnimatable&lt;T&gt; interface which has some T GetForFrame(int n) member. If you like, then you can have an `abstract class Animatable&lt;T&gt; implements IAnimatable&lt;T&gt;` and has a field of type Function&lt;T, int, T&gt; that is set by the constructor and called by GetForFrame. Then you can have implementations in AnimatableInt and AnimatableFloat etc. What you're describing is basically a [strategy pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/net/strategy-design-pattern)
WPF already has animatable stuff, you should check out the `System.Windows.Media.Animation` namespace in the PresentationCore library.
As an aside, you should take a look at how Apple does [CoreAnimation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore) if you’d like some inspiration. A lot of what you just said sounds familiar.
That’s a good idea, I shell updates the names
Well said ^ Example: https://www.dofactory.com/net/strategy-design-pattern#net
You might be interested in a "Discoverer" class I wrote a few years ago: [Discoverer.cs](https://github.com/OpenIIoT/OpenIIoT.Core/blob/master/OpenIIoT.SDK/Common/Discovery/Discoverer.cs) The idea is that you use the `Discoverable` attribute to guide the code in traversing an object graph from a given entry point and it aggregates and returns a list of everything that is assignable from the type you give it. [Discoverable] public class MyThing { [Discoverable] public OtherThing[] OtherThings { get; set; } [Discoverable] public OtherThing[] MoreThings { get; set; } } [Discoverable] public class OtherThing { [Discoverable] public ThingImLookingFor Thing { get; set; } = new ThingImLookingFor(); } In this case, if you had an instance of `MyThing` named `thisThing`, you'd do `var instances = Discover&lt;ThingImLookingFor&gt;(thisThing)` and you'd get a list containing all of the instances of `ThingImLookingFor` contained within all of the `OtherThing` instances from both lists. You can easily use reflection to get all of the types that implement the interface you're looking for, but you don't get the instances of those types and this class solves for that. Keep in mind that there's still an element of "registration" involved in that the code needs to be able to hop around via properties marked with `[Discoverable]`, but there's no need to manage a central registry, which is what I was trying to avoid when I wrote this.
I'm REALLY sorry I'm only commenting/replying now... I just want to comment to say THANK YOU EVERYONE for commenting and suggesting help.. I will give your suggestions a go tomorrow... I don't have time to reply individually but tomorrow I should (Sorry about this)
Hi selfwalkingdog, Thanks allot for your encouraging words! You might also be interested in a jQuery library that I built: [https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/jquery-ajax-loader](https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/jquery-ajax-loader) ( This allows you to convert any standard website into a Single Page App, without having to use React or Vue ) I have used this in conjunction with the CMS and it works great and makes any website feel snappy as though it was built in React or Vue. Thanks!
That would be a privacy issue, so browser vendors are fighting hard to prevent any such fingerprinting. That article already explains what you should do instead, anyway.
you could hash and embed the IP address in the JWT when issuing the it, and 401 any request where the requesting IP doesn't match.
A pattern where a static class is used to expose globally available functions for usage in different locations of your code. Just Google on helper class anti pattern. Or follow this link https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/avoid-utility-classes/
Ooh, don't do this. I've know business environments where your public IP changes between multiple failover routes. Don't attempt to bind an identity with a routing address.
Any fingerprint you might obtain from the browser, an attacker could simply lie about. You can't trust the client to be honest. A cryptographically secure random session ID or signed token stored in a cookie with the HttpOnly, Secure and preferably SameOrigin flags is the way to go.
Current standards that use JWT, like open id connect, bind identities to clients (spec names, a client in this case is the SPA). What you want is to bind the identity to the user agent instead (in this case, the browser). This seems really odd, as there's no way to have the user agent provide proof of itself. I doubt your going to actually get any type of security benefit here from what you're asking. It sounds like you just need to reduce the token lifetime to reduce risk.
yeah it's not a great solution if you are load balancing between multiple ISPs.
Not entirely true. Consider the fact that you need to know if the existence of the helper class. If someone other than the creator of the helper class has the need for the functionality and he/she doesn't know about the helper class then chances are that he/she would implement it again. The extension methods appear in the intellisence of your IDE. Aside from this using the extension method results in a more OOP style of programming regardless of the implementation details.
I am not sure I agree. The extension methods only appear in intellisense if the name space for the static extension class has been included. The lack of a helper class has actually made it harder to find the method.
Tools like resharper help a greatly with that sort of issues. You can also declare the extension class in the same namespace that the extended class lives in.
For the life of me I can't understand why people store tokens in their web clients instead of using cookies to store them (even if they are the same JWT tokens). I do have an API with multiple clients and my mobile apps do store the JWT token but the web client uses proper cookie with the same function. And no, you can't do what you want to do.
Technically this answers his question.
If you keep reading in the comments of the blog post then you will see that there is a lot of disagreement on the OP's statements. Basically any way of storing some kind of access token in the browser is insecure. So you should ask yourself what kind of sensitive data you are storing on your server. By removing that sensitive data you can remove the need for securing your token. As an example: don't store the users password but store a hash calculated over that password. Use two factor style authentication for sensitive functions, etc. etc. This way you can get your application at such a level that makes it acceptable to store the token in local/session storage.
More or less the same thing other people suggested, but I usually find it useful to write methods like this as non-generic methods operating on a `Type` object, instead of generic methods. It's fairly trivial to build a generic wrapper (`static Func&lt;T, int, T&gt; GetFunc&lt;T&gt;() =&gt; (Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;) GetFunc(typeof(T));`) and the interior of the non-generic method (which would have to return either `Delegate` or `object`) could be reduced to a dictionary lookup on the passed-in `Type`: private static readonly Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; _funcLookup = new Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; { [typeof(int)] = (int value, int n) =&gt; value * n, [typeof(string)] = (string value, int n) =&gt; StringBuild(value.Length * n) .Insert(0, value, n).ToString(), [typeof(ThirdPartyStruct)] = (ThirdPartyStruct value, int n) =&gt; value.SomeCustomOperation(n), // etc. }; private static Delegate GetFunc(Type t) =&gt; _funcLookup.TryGetValue(t, out var x) ? x : null; In this case, though, because both the wrapper and the actual function are teensy, I'd probably go with one method: static Func&lt;T, int, T&gt; GetFunc&lt;T&gt;() =&gt; _funcLookup.TryGetValue(typeof(T), out var x) ? (Func&lt;T, int, T&gt;) x : null; What I'm *not* clear on is how the casts here work out in the JIT. I assume that they can *not* just be discarded, in this case, owing to the level of redirection through a dictionary. Might be a non-issue for your use case, though.
agreed, whenever I need a string value with an enum, I use attributes too and use my extension helper class to get the value from it easily 
Fair enough. I actually thought the same thing when I was first introduced to it, but I later decided it made simple functions more readable.
&gt; I really appreciate your effort on this project. Just not enough to pay him, right? ;)
.Net Foundation doesn't do funding according to their charter. They *did* hire James NK to keep ~~Newtonsoft~~ JSON.Net alive though.
Google do something similar in their API SDKs: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/blob/2df445ea9fce00868cf0a1ea010cb40ef6ed64a8/Src/Support/Google.Apis.Core/Util/Utilities.cs#L41
you could try a more OOP-style approach, wich is even less error prone, a bit longer, but also more handy. This implementation makes it easier to let the player draw each card only once (using a shuffled `Stack&lt;Card&gt;`) and gets rid of the problematic parsing of the imaging using various `Dictionaries` , which is a bit more complex, but safer, too (if the filenames are correctly, order is now irrelevant). (based on the belief that you use images and need to link the pictures with the right values somehow. i am still using [these](http://acbl.mybigcommerce.com/52-playing-cards/), both versions look more or less the same: like [this](https://imgur.com/a/qrAEXPE)) using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Data; using System.Drawing; using System.Linq; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.IO; namespace WindowsFormsApp6 { public partial class Form1 : Form { private PictureBox[] _picBoxes; private int _cardCounter; private int _playerScore; private CardStack cd; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); _picBoxes = new[] { picboxCardOne, picboxCardTwo, picboxCardThree, picboxCardFour, picboxCardFive, }; Array.ForEach(_picBoxes, pb =&gt; pb.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom); _cardCounter = 0; _playerScore = 0; cd = new CardStack(@"..\Cards"); } private void btnDraw_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (_cardCounter &gt;= 5) return; Card nextCard = cd.DrawCard(); _picBoxes[_cardCounter].Image = nextCard.Image; _playerScore += nextCard.Value; lblPlayerScore.Text += $"+ {nextCard} = {_playerScore}{Environment.NewLine}"; _cardCounter++; } } enum Suits { Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, } class Card { public readonly string ValueName; public readonly Suits Suit; public readonly int Value; public readonly Image Image; public readonly bool Special; public Card(string vn, Suits suit, int val, Image img, bool spcl) =&gt; (ValueName, Suit, Value, Image, Special) = (vn, suit, val, img, spcl); public override string ToString() =&gt; Special ? $"{ValueName}({Value}, {Suit})" : $"{ValueName}({Suit})"; } class CardStack { private Stack&lt;Card&gt; _cards; public CardStack(string path) =&gt; _cards = CreateStack(path); public Card DrawCard() =&gt; _cards.Pop(); private Stack&lt;Card&gt; CreateStack(string path) { Dictionary&lt;char, Suits&gt; suitConverter = new Dictionary&lt;char, Suits&gt; { { 'C', Suits.Clubs }, { 'H', Suits.Hearts }, { 'D', Suits.Diamonds }, { 'S', Suits.Spades }, }; Dictionary&lt;string, (int Value, string Name, bool Special)&gt; valueConverter = new Dictionary&lt;string, (int, string, bool)&gt; { { "A", (1, "Ace", true) }, { "J", (11, "Jack", true) }, { "Q", (12, "Queen", true) }, { "K", (13, "King", true) }, }; Random rand = new Random(); return new Stack&lt;Card&gt;( Directory .GetFiles(path) .Select(f =&gt; { Image img = Image.FromFile(f); string fn = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(f); char suitChar = fn[fn.Length - 1]; string valueString = fn.Remove(fn.Length - 1); Suits suit = suitConverter[suitChar]; if (!valueConverter.TryGetValue(valueString, out var vn)) vn = (int.Parse(valueString), valueString, false); return new Card(vn.Name, suit, vn.Value, img, vn.Special); }) .OrderBy(x =&gt; rand.Next()) ); } } }

Depends on if you want the visualizer to actually work, this is just a post effect in the video so its not really functional. You can have an animation and have text on top. But if you are trying to make it a functional visualizer I am not sure WPF is the best option. 
You are trying to cheat proper OO patterns (esp. encapsulation and strategy pattern). The correct way to do it is: ``` abstract class SomeOtherClass&lt;T&gt; { public void Foo(...other_args, Func&lt;T, int, T&gt; func = null) { func = func ?? GetFunc; // ... } protected abstract T GetFunc(T value, int n); } class IntegerClass : SomeOtherClass&lt;int&gt; { protected override int GetFunc(int value, int n) { return value * n; } } // etc. ```
Are you using… *Web Forms??* *checks current date* Uhhhh… /s On another note, why do you have database access mixed in with the code? Also, it’s rather hard to recommend SQL without knowing the structure of the DB. We would need a UML diagram or something similar for both the DB structure as well as the code functionality. If this is web based, is there any compelling reason why it isn’t MVC? 
To be fair, I didn't get paid for the work I did in open source either, I've been working on writing a book, a transpiler for CIL to LLVM IR, created P/Invoke tool and so forth out of passion for programming and for researching various technologies and concepts. When you put something out on a free and open source license, you have to expect to **NOT** get paid for it at all.
You only need to do it twice, once within the constructor for the view model - and once to update the entity with view model changes. With some well constructed inheritance, if you have multiple view models, you can keep it to a minimum - but the answer is yes. You gotta get those values from one object to the other somehow, even if there is some abstraction to accomplish that.
you can simulate discriminated unions in C#, so I thought I read on some article a while ago.
Its a winform. You mean the sql connection? I want the bookcode column fill in the datatable as well once I import an excel file that contain bookcode column thats why i put it along in that method. 
You should really be building a data access layer to implement an ORM to deal with database access. That way you aren’t mixing in SQL in with the regular code. What you are doing is really bad form for anything other than a very quick and dirty proof of concept. Which kind of an ORM you use - Dapper, NHibernate or Entity Framework, etc., - is mostly a matter of personal preference, but if this code will see any degree of serious usage whatsoever, you need to clean it up. Otherwise you will eventually end up with a nigh-unmaintainable mess of spaghetti code. If this is going to be any sort of a serious program that will need maintaining for anything more than a year or three, please, Please, PLEASE choose anything other than Web Forms or Winforms for your platform. Using either of those two is like choosing a horse and buggy as your primary mode of transportation - still fundamentally effective, but unless you’re an Amish, far from the best solution possible. Winforms is like heroin - super easy to get started on, but it seriously fucks you up in really short order. If you are building a desktop app, go for WPF (using an MVVM framework) to target all current versions of Windows, or UWP if you want to target only Windows 10. Trust me, you will thank me later once the project gets larger.
Check out [https://github.com/api2pdf/api2pdf.dotnet](https://github.com/api2pdf/api2pdf.dotnet) which offers Headless Chrome as one of the options. You should be able to get up and running in minutes.
Ummm. Might be a silly question but do you have the source to those libraries? If they’re .net 4.x you will still need 4.x installed...
Auto mapper! Check it out :) 
And when you use something for free, you have to expect **NOT** to get lifetime support for nothing.
I assume they are going to be two different frameworks. If you kept your UI / logic in separate projects, you should be able to create a new UI in UWP. From what I understand UWP uses winRT instead of the win32 library.
No duh, that why I fork off and maintain it myself from this point on.
I don't know how dependency injection works in unity, but if it's an option you could register an ilist&lt;IYourInterface&gt; to inject yourIoCContainer.GetAllInstances&lt;IYourInterface&gt; and then just loop through them. &amp;#x200B; Otherwise, some of these other options mentioned in this thread work.
You can use something like Automapper to reduce the amount of mapping code you have to write. In C# MVC you're kind of stuck with all this inefficient plumbing, at least on the write side, or else you're going to have maintenance issues down the road. If you break from CRUD and use commands with rich domain models, you can pass commands all the way from the action into your domain models with little mapping required (although then you have to make commands into domain model alterations). In addition, when reading data I prefer a CQRS approach where you read the data from the database in the shape it's going to be used on the page. This eliminates the mapping when reading data and has other benefits. There is no perfect answer to these inefficiencies and unfortunately MVC was built in a different era when passing your models all the way up and down the pipeline was considered good. This led to getting applications up and going quickly but led to maintenance hell (see the trash patterns scaffolding gives you).
[AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) was designed for this type of problem. It maps values from one object to another according to rules or conventions. Given the scenario described above the conventions-based approach would seem to solve most of your concerns with minimal coding. &amp;#x200B; It's available from NuGet, the documentation is pretty healthy ([Getting Started](https://automapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-started.html)) and specifically the [Conventions](https://automapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Conventions.html) page will help you quickly evaluate if it's a good fit.
Depends on which API your are using, not on the absolute version of .Net you are targeting to. In you are using Visual Studio, you should check that extension out: [.NET Portability Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ConnieYau.NETPortabilityAnalyzer) and run it on your projects/solution. That extension is open-source and the related project is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-apiport.
&gt; If my WinForms and WPF apps have a bunch of libraries that are currently targeting for .NET Framework 4.6, will it migrate with little to no issues to .NET Core 3.0? No. You or whoever has the source code to them needs to migrate those libraries. If they already compile against .NET Standard, you’re good to go, but odds are they do not. &gt; My initial thought was since .NET Core 3.0 would support desktop applications, migrating to it would be simple as pushing a button. That ain’t gonna happen for any non-trivial app.
I ran this extension and most of my libraries report as 100 under .NET Core. I assume this means that it is ready to migrate to .NET Core 3.0?
If you're looking for actively supported alternatives , you backed the wrong horse with .net. Node / express has tons and tons of supported options. Pug, ejs, handlebars, hell you can even go with vash if razor syntax is your thing. They can all be used similarly as how your CMS app uses razorengine. i.e. a transform engine. I find it puzzling that MS themselves never saw the potential to use razor in use cases such as yours.
The only thing that makes sense to me on the last one is if you are using code you don't control or there is some really strong reason you can't just modify your interface/service to support it.
Lucky you. I have some reporting 98% and those 2% are a pain to fix. Yes it should mean that it is compatible. Doesn't replace proper testing but gives a good confidence.
yeah, the types and methods themselves work fine, I'm talking about configuring a channel factory.
Good post, thanks. When you talk about restoring the internal state of the saga, where is that state being restored from? Do you typically prefer to store that in a database as well? Trying to think through the implementation, including making sure the operations / saga service can scale horizontally too.
Some db or cache, thinkgs like Redis will be extremely fast and scalable.
You're making them faster than I can watch them :) Good work :)

He's using .netcore 3.0 which includes [this feature from .netcore 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/06/28/announcing-net-core-2-0-preview-2/#user-content-reference-net-framework-libraries-from-net-standard) So he can absolutely reference .net framework 4.6.1 and above.

Why the heck would you call it there? What's your reasoning? Rule of thumb: Don't fiddle with the GC. Let it do its job.
the deserializedData is gen 2, consuming a lot of memory. By calling it I'm freeing almost almost 2GB of memory. But I'm not sure if it's worth it.
There are many ways, but add existing file with a linked file, in another project can help you ease the migration. Step by step
it is commented in the article that it slows between 10x and 100x and stopping kills the process. Hopefully it will get better.

He probably needs some reflection this.GetType().GetFields().First(f =&gt; f.Name == $"termin_{i}").SetValue(this, i+42); Best way forward /s PS: /s means sarcastic - don't do it. No.
Yes, that's me. Glad you liked it!
Because - for some reason - you need to wait for an asynchronous method in a synchronous manner thus calling Task.Run(DoAsync).GetAwaiter().GetResult(); unwraps the exception from DoAsync and you don't need to handle the aggregateexception
Which is wrong. It should be dispatched to an async worker queue which would handle the e-mail sending and await the result so possible exceptions can be handled.
Here is the source for the wcf libraries https://github.com/dotnet/wcf. You may have some luck creating an issue over there if the codebase doesn't support your use case. Out of curiosity what are you trying to accomplish with channel factories? Do you have a custom protocol?
Yes, but you can also call DoAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult(), cutting out the thread pool delegation. You should only use your proposed solution if the execution path of DoAsync() contains code that could deadlock.
On Linux and Mac it uses the open source libgdiplus.

Microsoft is already distributing and maintaining SkiaSharp. SkiaSharp is a .NET binding to Google’s imaging library that powers Chrome and Android: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/SkiaSharp It has a powerful imaging model, great support for vector graphics, very high performance implementation, great integration with native hooks and it has almost every feature a modern user would need. We keep up with Google, so when new capabilities are brought to Skia, we bring those to you in SkiaSharp. We make it available in NuGet form with its native dependencies so it works across the board on all major operating systems: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp Linux used to be tricky due to all the variations and our desire to keep the download small - we have addressed that recently: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/wiki/SkiaSharp-Native-Assets-for-Linux Miguel
The video is not from me. &amp;#x200B; I use VS2017 Community and the version in the video looks the same. Maybe it's VS2019 preview? 
im on VS2017 too struggling to load the project from https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/pull/160 thought there's some special config im not aware of 
This is dope, i'll try to run the tests tonight at home. You doing this for fun on your spare time or you working for Reddit?
Probably not standard practice but I avoid creating multiple view models by instead splitting my view up into multiple partial views, and these partial views can pull from different models by using Razor's RenderAction method which allows you to route to different controller methods from the view. This works for me because I'm using AJAX on these partial views anyway but it did feel like a cleaner way of doing things even before I was using AJAX. The downside to this is that your site would need to go through the MVC life cycle a fair few times depending on how many partial views you have setup on your view although I haven't noticed a significant performance drop.
Just me. Been awhile since I was employed by anyone lol. I started writing it because I needed it for some other projects. Then it just kinda snowballed from there. Not sure if it's worth mentioning in my resume, though, but that would be kinda nice I suppose. Thanks!
&gt; My main concern right now is making sure all the integration tests are passing for everyone. Why not build a CI pipeline? If the tests pass on Travis CI/Appveyor/Azure Devops they'll pass everywhere. I can help with this if you aren't comfortable with it.
I know that there are opinions that client side processing should not be used to optimize data access. However I tested performance with sequential loading and parallel threads and I do have 170ms instead of 210ms loading times so better performance for all tables combined in all tests. I know that doesn't sound much but we are very performance sensitive in our professional applications. &amp;#x200B; See: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13908993/how-to-use-task-parallel-iibrary-with-ado-net-data-access](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13908993/how-to-use-task-parallel-iibrary-with-ado-net-data-access)
Hey there, I tried it out for a little bit and here are some things that I noticed. # Well done * I really like the way that the UI is designed. You seem to pay a lot of attention to details which I find great. For instance, I really like: * that most buttons have tooltips * that you can resize the three main panels * the use of colors (not too much color, but in places where they perfectly synergize with the rest of the UI) * that it resembles the UI of Postman (this means that you don't have to "learn a new app", even though it has same purpose as the old one). * while I am not a fan of emojis, I like how you use them as placeholders in the middle panel. This makes the whole app seem more lively. * the overall use of Fluent Design guidelines. * The app supports what I would need for quick API calls. I can make requests, modify headers and see the responses. That is basically all that I would need such an app for. * Again, the attention to details are quite nice, even feature wise. For instance, I like how you can toggle different Headers via Checkboxes. Sure, this is a small thing, but I could see a developer forgetting something like that, because you could simply delete unused headers. # Points to work on In no particular order: * Now this may be hard for this type of app, but it would be nice, if it scaled correctly. When resizing it to the smallest size, the panels don't scale well (not at all, actually). Thus, the app becomes unusable at small sizes. I don't really know how to improve this (maybe vertical navigation for small sizes?), but an app being responsive is quite important to me, because it allows me to easily have two windows side-by-side. * Syntax-highlighting is a requirement, in my opinion. Ideally, the result viewer (be it JSON or HTML) would auto-detect the language and highlight the code. A nice plus would be the ability to auto-format it. * I am not able to move requests into collections via Drag&amp;Drop. This should be possible, otherwise collections are pointless. * I have not figured out a way to rename requests or collections. * The app complains about missing `http://`s if I enter URLs like `google.com`. That is tedious work for a user, so I would expect the app to automatically "fix" my URLs. * Regarding environments: It would be nice to have an in-app example of how to use the keys that I defined in the environment dialog in the address bar. In Postman, it works via `{{myKey}}`, but how does it work here? Sure, one can try things out, but an example would be nice. For instance, hidden behind a `(?)` button in the environments dialog. (if you get what I mean) * Even though I like colors in general, you should update some. For instance, this: https://imgur.com/a/t9ey0Uu is barely readable. This is something that I would totally expect: * In your privacy policy, you state that you are collecting anonymous usage diagnostics. I feel like people need a way to opt-out of this. Sure, it's anonymous, but I like to turn this off whenever possible. # Summary I like the way that you are going with this app. Sure, I think that this will not replace an app like Postman in the near future, simply because they have much more features. But if you don't view the app as an alternative, but as a small viewer for quick requests, it works perfectly well. I also like to see UWP apps, to be honest. Not that it's that important, but your app is much more lightweight than, say, Postman, which is very nice. All in all, I really like what you are doing. Good job, keep it up!
Some initial points for a code review after seeing it for the first time: If some of your fields have restrictions, enforce them in constructor. I.E.: MultiURLInput.cs, check the length of the display name and throw an exception if you are restricting to 50 characters always. I think you are using too much inheritance. A perfect example is everything inheriting the basemodel which inherits a request in the models folder. I'd rather you think about what interactions a model can have with a request, and then model that. Every time you need to adjust constructors right now you are modifying too many files. Also, the JsonConvert.DeserializeObject stuff in Models feels really fragile to me. Why not have that be a part of the ExecuteRequest as a generic? The things folder is kinda weird. I'm not sure you want to tag everything with Newtonsoft attributes, especially considering how it's being pushed to the side in future Core updates. I'm assuming that you are having issues with the property naming scheme, I'd look at having that be configured somewhere else. I can do more code reviews if you'd like later.
Haha :D.
I would mention it. I haven't perused the GIT yet, but as long as your responses to PR and stuff are professional-ish i would.
I mean, while I would love to make a browserless (kinda) Reddit client. I don't see any other reasons to use this other than making some sort of thread/keyword watchers.
Also, I think that subreddit stuff might be something else you might want to extract as an aspect and set up for context, making it invisible for each model. If reddit is consistent on the URI modeling, I'd expect your context to prepend the subreddit if it's been specified with one.
Hi blusky75, Thank you for your comment! I am a huge opensource proponent and always have been, I used to actually be a strictly LAMP developer a long time ago and even built my own PHP MVC Framework and CMS system ( [https://sourceforge.net/projects/macs-framework/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/macs-framework/) ) and released it in 2007. But then the financial crisis hit and I was layed off, the next job that i got was at a .NET development shop, I had to leave my anti-ms bias behind and I got sucked into the .NET echo system, and to my surprise I actually really liked working with C# and the Visual Studio IDE. I then when searching for a good .NET CMS system but there were really no good alternatives in the .NET world. ( Keep in mind this was before MS started embracing open source and even before .NET MVC version 1 was released. It was even before NodeJS was really a thing. I wish .NET Core existed back then because I really like what MS is doing with it and I could have built this CMS using it. ) This is when I decided to build my own CMS system. When I initially built it i leveraged the telerik controls however since I wanted to make the CMS opensource, I had to re-build the CMS again including rebuilding all the controls from scratch using jQuery. Another reason was because I wanted to learn, if all you do is use pre-build systems and solutions you don't really learn anything about how to use the underlying technology. After going through this technology shift, I have become language agnostic for the most part and simply want to excel in whatever language / technology I am using at that point in my career. Thanks!
Last thing I see off the bat: Anything that isn't a raw DTO, make readonly by default. Your life will be a lot nicer.
Wow good work! Very valuable for the C# ecosystem, gonna give it a try later.
I'll take a crack at it when I get home tonight
Or some stats, or bots or many other things.
I don’t disagree with you. Just saying I’ve seen that before.
What happens if 2 users book something at once? Is it going to break or do you only want to do price calculations and the like?
Partial dto class adding calculation.
Hi, there are plenty of sources in the Internet on how to use Events and how they are implemented so I won't go into details with that. Providing an event when a status has changed does make sense if a subscriber to the event does not have to decide if the status should be changed but should be able to react on a status change. In our project we usually provide such events and in addition some BeforeBeginRun and AfterBeginRun virtual methods that can be overwritten. That way one can decide in an override method if the status should be changed (e.g. in the BeforeBeginRun method) with a certain return value. You can do this with events too by providing an eventargs object that contains a return value but I do not recommended this. &amp;#x200B; Always keep in mind that there can be many subscribers to an event. All of them will be called. &amp;#x200B; Hope this was helpful.
In my demo that needs to be evaluated (perhaps in a later Version) when a commit happens to the database. Currently the demo will break as there is no constraint on that. Good point however, thanks! I don't get it how to combine JavaScript with the EF. Do you have a source for that to explain me?
YAAS! Daddy's going to have some machine learning fun with this!
I make software for the *task at hand*, not the users. If you want to live in user-facing app development land, go ahead and chase the ad-supported revenue stream. But most of the *real* money to be made is in custom "enterprise" apps which don't give two shits about the *user* and instead serve a job description that any person can be swapped into and trained for. My experience comes from WinMo development for a shipment tracking/handling app with barcode scanning and a huge amount of support from a web service talking to a database on the back-end. You have to cache scan events locally on the device and have a background process try to send them when signal quality is good, because you can't always get a cellular signal in BFE. Fortunately, the newest (but still old) WinMo devices don't have much trouble with storage. You can stick an SD card in them and get enough space (a few GB) to work with. Also, nobody even talked about "wanking off frameworks", so I'm really not sure what point you're trying to make there.
I'm not anti MS but I too have had first-hand experience with RazorEngine. I built one app using the library. A transform app to accept http post json data, transform it to XML, and fire off the XML data to a secure FTP (my client's ERP system isn't REST aware nor can it handle json so this middleware I wrote bridged that trading partner gap). In hindsight it was slow and did a poor job cleaning up any real-time assemblies it built. It did the job , but if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have picked c# / RazorEngine for my app. Problem with razor is it's designed to ONLY be used in the context of MVC. Hence the hack that is RazorEngine. Node templating engines don't have this glass ceiling. If I want to use pug or hbs to transform a model, I can do that without using any MVC at all.
This looks like a microsoft video which is a huge turn off to me. I didn't watch this video long enough to verify, but the format makes me think it's another video of two guys clowning around and occasionally teaching the subject. I don't want dry boring content but I do want focused learning without the clowning and laughing at their own attempts at humor.
Spoiler: The reddit API is pointless since it requires you to disclose your full legal name, and agree to a restrictive set of terms in the licensing agreement.
\&gt; I make software for the *task at hand*, not the users. &amp;#x200B; A different mentality, for sure. Not one that I agree personally. &amp;#x200B; \&gt; most of the *real* money to be made is in custom "enterprise" apps &amp;#x200B; I know, it's what kept me happily employed for years until I moved to corporate, user facing apps. It's also my main source of outside consultancy precisely because of people like you &amp;#x200B; \&gt; apps which don't give two shits about the *user* and instead serve a job description that any person can be swapped into and trained for. &amp;#x200B; Except the 90's are over. Having one piece of software on the factory floor is that's so bad it that loses you 30% total productivity. Even internal software is now a big market, because less shitty UI = less training time. It's business. Please, keep doing that marvelous job, while the rest of us pick your slack and develop proper software WITH ALSO proper UI. &amp;#x200B; \&gt; My experience comes from WinMo development for a shipment tracking/handling app &amp;#x200B; Seems like a nice project, with lots of places to go wrong but you seem to have taken it all into account. Kudos. &amp;#x200B; \&gt; nobody even talked about "wanking off frameworks" &amp;#x200B; OP was talking about Xamarim, nevermind.
Hi blusky75, I never intended to label you as anti-ms, sorry if that is how my comment came across. I was just providing you with a context on how I was anti-ms in the past and now embrace whatever language I am using in my career. I am sure all your points are valid, based on your experience. Im sure if i had found a job in NodeJS and my career took me down that path I would have built this CMS using NodeJS and express. As stated in my previous comment, my main goal is learning and excelling in whatever language I am using currently in my career / day-to-day life. But who knows in the future I might build a NodeJS and express based CMS system seeing how I built one in PHP when that was my day-to-day programming language :) Thanks!
I haven't used SkiaSharp in real world projects but for the purposes of image manipulation it seems like it has inferior API compared to ImageSharp at least when looking at the examples. Also there is value in having an image manipulation library written in .NET instead of a wrapper of some native library
It's a bit too coupled; the student could have many teachers and not necessarily care about all of their assignments. The objects can live separately and still subscribe to the teacher's assignments, no need to take the teacher object as an argument in the constructor. And your event should be a generic handler taking a specific EventArgs implementation, maybe something like this: public class Teacher { public event EventHandler&lt;AssignmentEventArgs&gt; HomeworkAssigned; public void AssignHomework(Assignment assignment) { HomeworkAssigned?.Invoke(this, new AssignmentEventArgs(this.Name, assignment)); } // all your code } public class AssignmentEventArgs : EventArgs { public string Teacher { get; } public Assignment Homework { get; } public AssignmentEventArgs(string teacherName, Assignment assignment) { Teacher = teacherName; Homework = assignment; } } public class Assignment { public string Subject { get; } public DateTime DueDate { get; } public Assignment(string subject, DateTime dueDate) { Subject = subject; DueDate = dueDate; } } &amp;#x200B; var teacher1 = new Teacher("Mark"); var teacher2 = new Teacher("Jen"); var student1 = new Student("Dave"); var student2 = new Student("Olav"); var completelyDifferentObjectThatLoveAssignments = new SomeLoggerMaybe(); teacher1.HomeworkAssigned += student1.ReceiveAssignment; teacher2.HomeworkAssigned += student1.ReceiveAssignment; teacher1.HomeworkAssigned += student2.ReceiveAssignment; teacher1.HomeworkAssigned += completelyDifferentObjectThatLovesAssignments.LogAssignmentToDatabase; // inline lambda subscription teacher2.HomeworkAssigned += (s, e) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(e.Teacher + " posted a new " + e.Assignment.Subject + " assignment."); &amp;#x200B;
It's very simple to break it down if you leave out the parts that are unrelated to the event. Teacher has an event to raise. Student subscribes to it. public class Teacher { public event EventHandler&lt;HomeworkAssignedEventArgs&gt; HomeworkAssigned; protected virtual void OnHomeworkAssigned(HomeworkAssignedEventArgs e) { if(this.HomeworkAssigned != null) { this.HomeworkAssigned(this, e); } // equivalent to the newer syntax that VS will suggest now: //this.HomeworkAssigned?.Invoke(this, e); // both of these do the same thing: only run the subscribed event handlers if there are any, but skip it if not. } public void DoTeacherStuff() { // gonna assign some homework now! HomeworkAssignedEventArgs e = new HomeworkAssignedEventArgs(); this.OnHomeworkAssigned(e); } } public class Student { private Teacher _teacher = null; public Student(Teacher t) { this._teacher = t; this._teacher.HomeworkAssigned += this.Teacher_HomeworkAssigned; } private void Teacher_HomeworkAssigned(object sender, HomeworkAssignedEventArgs e) { // do stuff } } Some simple, but informal "rules" for events: * The class that raises the event has the `event`. * The `event` is just an attachment point, not an actual function. You should call it through a `protected virtual` function, in case you want to wrap additional functionality around it pre- or post-raise, and in case any subclasses need to alter that functionality. * The subscriber needs to hold a strong reference to the publisher, otherwise the publisher could become a memory leak. (If all other objects stop referring to the event's publisher, but the event is still attached, it has "leaked" because the GC won't ever collect it. So keep a local copy of the publisher reference and/or detach events when you're done with them.) * You probably want to make an EventArgs subclass for each of your events. Most of the "easy" events are built-in to the framework, so you're probably doing the "heavy" ones and are going to be passing some data structures around. That's what EventArgs is for. So "HomeworkAssignedEventArgs" might include details about the assignment, due date, etc. You'll want to make those objects immutable, so all of that data gets passed in the constructor and then only implement the `get` property accessors.
Thanks for the help! I understand now why I should de-couple it and I also understand why it's beneficial to have a `HomeworkEventArgs` class. &amp;#x200B; However, I don't quite understand what is going on with `teacher1.HomeworkAssigned += student1.ReceiveAssignment`. Yes, I see that we're attaching a method (delegate?) to the Teacher HomeworkAssigned EventHandler. What, though, is the Student ReceiveAssignment? It looks like a method in the Student class? But how do we know which Assignment is in fact assigned? &amp;#x200B; Thanks again!
&gt; My point wasn’t that you shouldn’t use client-side evaluation when you need too There is no good reason to use client-side evaluation in EF, ever! [Nuke it from space](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbfMkh940Q)
No worries :) Depending on what aspects of the Microsoft stack I'm working on, I can be pro-MS one day and anti-MS the next haha. Love their OSS adoption with azure / docker / .net core...not too fond of their MS 365 offerings such as PowerApps. I enjoy working in dotnet core but the ecosystem for third party nuget libraries doesn't hold a candle to node/npm. Not to mention there are still many gaps still present in .net core (e.g. no printing framework since all that is win32 + system.imaging.\*) I was solely a c# dev up until a couple years ago when I had to integrate a customer with their enterprise document management platform (a SaaS document storage platform they subscribe to). The SDK docs and code samples for the platform were all Javascript based so I had to learn node by necessity to keep my budgets lean (I already had plenty of JS experience so node was a natural progression). I've come to enjoy using node as my go-to language. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
`ReceiveAssignment` is up for you to implement. Since it subscribes to the HomeworkAssigned event it must have the same signature: be `void` and have the parameters of `object sender` and `AssignmentEventArgs e` So it's up to you to decide what the student must then do with those objects - you can get the teacher/teacher's name through the eventargs object, and the assignment itself, and the subject. &amp;#x200B; What the student object does with that information is up to you, depending on what kind of application you're making. Maybe it's a proper curriculum management app that automatically inserts the assignment in the student's account calendar, and sends an email/sms notification if the student checked some box. That's entirely up to the purpose of your application and your classes.
You can use DescriptionAttribute, too. It's good to have both, in case you want to pop up a tooltip or something.
Classic example: That GDI+ image resizing and watermarking library that everyone that did ASP.Net WebForms has from 2007.
A really short explanation on what they do in layman terms: Delegate: Its like a variable which can store MethodCalls Event: Its like a list of Method Calls (delegates) and whenever a event is "fired", you just go into that list and call each function. 
&gt;Please, keep doing that marvelous job, while the rest of us pick your slack and develop proper software WITH ALSO proper UI. That seems unnecessary. It's a crappy WinMo app for crappy WinMo devices that I had no say in choosing. I'd happily dump it for Android in a heartbeat. (But I'd probably go with Xamarin, wankery or not, because I'm about eleventy times more productive in C# than in Java due to time spent familiarizing myself with it.) The UI for that app was kept simple on purpose, and the users had relatively few problems with it. That is, until we brought someone in to make it have a "better UX". Then it went to hell. It's inconsistent, it's *ugly* (but it's WinMo, so how could it not be?), and it's *slow* (again, WinMo). It takes a million taps on tiny little "pretty" buttons to get anything done. And I'm not allowed to change it because an "expert in UX" designed it. Nevermind the fact that the actual users hate it and their box-hauling sausage-fingers can't hit the buttons consistently. Less-shitty UI *does* reduce training time. But shitty UI isn't always the developer's fault, and hiring a "UX designer" isn't always a good idea.

Quality feedback. Well done. 
&gt; Is there a straightforward way of doing this? You can create your own custom class that mimics ReadOnlyObservableCollection and listens for CollectionChanged events. It's not even that hard because essentially all you do is catch the original event and repeat it as if it were coming from your read-only collection. All of the other methods/properties on your collection just forward the calls to the underlying observable collection, adding the necessary casts.
I still don't like it. Plus you lose the parameter name.
I've update the NLua to support .NET Core/Linux and to use the latest Lua 5.3.5 [https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLua/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLua/) . MoonSharp is nice, but is about 10x slower then p/Invoke the native Lua. 
Actually, someone did the statistics and NLua has faster Lua, whereas Moonsharp has faster C# API calls. Or was it in reverse?

I've tested the these core tests [https://github.com/NLua/KeraLua/tree/master/tests/LuaTests/core](https://github.com/NLua/KeraLua/tree/master/tests/LuaTests/core) hooking print to a C# method.

The other point is Lua has been developed for almost 26 years, I think would be better to rely on the legacy code base instead try to write your own VM.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** alphaglosined! ^(hug)
Makes sense, I'll give it a shot again soon.
Actually, I don't like an idea to render webpage and save it to disk. Perhaps you should load html-content only then parse it and seek that you need in there. Try [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=netframework-4.7.2), or [that](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=netframework-4.7.2). 
You could also look at StyleCop.Analyzers, which are Roslyn/live analyzers and codefixes, comparable to codemaid. BUT the Stylecop.Analyzers can be made part of the solution, allowing you to even fail the build (even on build servers without any extra software installed) on certain violations, if you want to.
Trying to understand the cleanest way to format and write this to my console app. Any insight is greatly appreciated. 
&gt;Teacher has an event to raise. Student subscribes to it. &gt; &gt;The class that raises the event has the `event`. I really like this -- helps a lot in thinking about where to place the relevant event code. &gt;The subscriber needs to hold a strong reference to the publisher, otherwise the publisher could become a memory leak. Very interesting! Thanks a lot!
Removed: Rule 4. Regarding formatting the output, look at the [interpolated strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated) language feature.
All fair points, thanks.
Try defining your own script in package.json. Something like ` ... scripts": { "ng": "ng", "build": "ng build", "test": "ng test", "lint": "ng lint", "e2e": "ng e2e", ** "build-prod: "ng build --prod"** }, ... `
Builders will change your life! Especially if you go down the route of generic builders, so you don't have to muck around with a ton of boilerplate.
I don't have an example on how to exactly implement the solution too of mind, but I think it has to do with the way you set the src attribute. I think you might need to set the image source property in the code behind instead of mixing the image data with the html markup... 
Probably it. But i don't know how to implement it. I saw a post suggesting a handle with a get on the id. Example: handler.ashx?id=&lt;%#&gt; and the tags, but i coudn't get it running. 
Don't disagree, but I'm saying that any classes the guy is using shouldn't allow setting data by default. Whether you use a factory or a builder or a raw constructor, I don't really care. Public setter by default for anything that's not a DTO is a pretty big code smell.
Depending on the usage throughout your app/clients, modifying the interface might be a bad idea as well. That's where the Interface Segregation principal comes in, you'd just create a new interface that uses old one as a base INewInterface : IOldInterface {} and have your new service use the new interface, that way you can freely add whatever you want to the new interface while keeping all current usages of the old one fully functional.
What would someone use this for? 
Just a heads up but your updated formatting got blown (markdown is a pain)
Make the SRC attribute a link to a separate action that gets the record from the database and returns a filestream. Let each &lt;image&gt; tag deal with its own request.
I don't want to sound like an ass, but this is an old video from 2013 with terrible audio and video quality. I'm sure there are plenty of better free tutorials out there.
Convert to base64 string and write that into the src attribute.
isnt that what a terminal is for?
I guess you think of JavaScript for an ASP.NET app. The demo is a WinForms app though.
&gt;Depending on the usage throughout your app/clients, modifying the interface might be a bad idea as well. I think this is the real reason there isn't a clear single answer. Each situation is different. 
I tried this now to add a partial class "Vorführung" for the calculation of the remaining seats. At a first glimse this seems to work as the calculated value gets displayed with the right value in the datagrid. However when I add another booking into the datagrid it looks like there is a new record in the Vorfuehrung table although the datagrid does not show any and I get a null ref exception. Therefore I added the code to check on null values and tested the app again. The values on the datagrid Vorfuehrung do not get refreshed when I add another record to the booking table. In addition it looks like I had another record in the Vorfuehrung - table that is not visible in the datagrid because when I try to commit the changes to the database I get an error at the .SaveChanges() call because this kind of new record? that I did not create seems to cause a conflict with ID in the table Vorfuehrung in the FK\_Buchung\_Vorfuehrung relation. This relation and adding another booking works perfectly fine however when I remove the new partial class that should calculate the remaining seats. I need your help. What is going on? &amp;#x200B; namespace DAO { public partial class Vorfuehrung { public long RemainingSeats { get { long remaining = 0; if (Saal != null &amp;&amp; Buchung != null) remaining = Saal.AnzahlPlaetze - Buchung.Count(); return remaining; } } } } &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
What *actual* problem does this solve? Why all the hack with the keys and WeakReferences instead of using strongly typed object references. This is anti-OOP without any benefits.
interesting
to utilize Reddit's APIs from a managed library
Does this actually work? I think you’ll need a WeakDictionary that actually understands it shouldn’t hold strong references to its values.
&gt; What actual problem does this solve? Memory consumption (and possibly leaks). &gt; Why all the hack with the keys and WeakReferences instead of using strongly typed object references. This is anti-OOP without any benefits. WeakReferences are strongly typed. This has nothing to do with “anti-OOP”.
Yeah but terminals are so limiting as to output. Students can easily make an interface and get better reinforcement in Forms. 
Is c# the language for this? I didn't think reddit's api was built for speed....
I know it happens a lot but imo teaching programming on visual studio is like teaching driving in an automatic.
 A criticism of the pattern comes from MVVM creator John Gossman himself, who points out that the overhead in implementing MVVM is "overkill" for simple UI operations. He says that for larger applications, generalizing the ViewModel becomes more difficult. Moreover, he illustrates that data binding in very large applications can result in considerable memory consumption. 
Learn on the tools you are going to use. 
Yes it' C#. Most of the endpoints take less than one second to complete.
I don't know if i got it correctlyi but in this case i would make another database request or something. My case it's the listview who makes the request for every itemTemplate. 
Yea I’d be winging it in WebForms. I’m not sure the right way to go about it. It’d be pretty easy to do in MVC with a separate action. If you’re stuck in WebForms, I wish you luck! If not, and it’s a new project, I recommend re-rolling in Core or MVC 5. I wouldn’t be starting any new WebForms projects at this point.
Ahhh ok. That makes sense. Thanks. 
I cannot thank you enough for this. Not only are the points you made extremely valuable, the fact that you wrote it out in such a manner and with such clarity suggests you spent some time writing this. For taking that time out of your day to provide this feedback, I truly thank you. Going to be working on all these as soon as I can. 
This. It'll provide a lot of value going forward as well
I was like you too and thought I can start to earn money with my first project after learning C++ in School. Back then in the year 1999 there was no C# so I started my first project with QT and C++ for the company of my father. It was a complete desaster. I developed everything on my Linux computer and the software was finished and worked perfectly on Linux. Then we tried to run the same Code with QT on Windows and we were shocked. The UI performance was so poor since we did a lot of UI stuff that worked fine on Linux but was a complete desaster for the Windows Version back then. I think it was Windows 95 or 98. We had to redevelop the whole software for Windows based on WinAPI. I never touched QT again after that experience. However I learned a lot about proper project management as such issues should be avoided with early prototype testing on both machines. After that experience I had enough of WinAPI programming and started to develop with Visual Basic and Microsoft SQL Server for another company. That worked fine until .NET came along and the software had to be redeveloped with [VB.NET](https://VB.NET). I decided to switch to another company that worked with C# and Microsoft SQL Server as I felt better with C# than with [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) for my future. That was in 2005. I think this was the right step to do and I am still programming C# and MS SQL Server as I love this programming language. So what I want to tell you is that you will do a lot of mistakes in the beginning. That is normal as you need to slowly build your experience in programming and project management. Don't expect this to be easy but you can earn really good as a programmer. If you love programming like I do then do it! You shouldn't do it for the money as the most important reason however but the most important thing is that you love programming. Otherwise you probably wont stay on course long enough when you experience your own first setbacks because you will make mistakes as I did. That's for sure. Try to learn from your own mistakes and build on the right attitude towards your own continuous progress. I wish you all the best!
I am confused by what you are trying to accomplish? You can set a value for a specific Cell by calling Worksheet.Cell\[x,y\] = value You can also specify a range if you want to put in a whole row at once. int rowNumber = 1; foreach (System.Data.DataRow row in dataTable.Rows) { Worksheet.Cells.Range[Worksheet.Cells[rowNumber, 1], Worksheet.Cells[rowNumber, row.ItemArray.Count()] ] .Value2 = row.ItemArray; rowNumber++; } &amp;#x200B;
That sounds like a great idea! I've never actually implemented CI before, but I'm sure I can figure it out easily enough. That being said, I'd rather not have to delay my release schedule, so I'd of course be grateful for lending your experience in this area. It would certainly save me some valuable time, at least. In your experience, roughly what would be involved in setting something like this up? Would any code changes be necessary for compatibility? I'll read up on this later on when I have more time. I still won't feel comfortable putting out a stable release until at least a handful of people have reproduced my test results in their own dev environments, but after that I wouldn't mind relying on a CI approach from then on, assuming it doesn't screw up my Git branching model, of course. Thanks for your help! 
Thanks! That's always nice to hear.
Thanks! Please let me know how it goes. I'm eager to find out if the tests are passing for other people.
I want the data in bookcode to be side by side with "3" column (updated the photo). I used the 2nd solution but it give me an error saying ExcelRange does not contain a definition for Range. I am not using namespace using.microsoft.interop.excel
I see. So if somebody asks me why they can't get their app to authenticate, you're saying I *shouldn't* tell him it's because his mother didn't love him and that he should go fuck himself?
There is a bit ambiguity here. The notion of strong and weak references has nothing to do with the types of the references objects. The garbage collectors considers an object in the object graph to be live when it is reachable from one of the root nodes via at least one strong reference (or a chain of strong references). Weak references alone will not keep an object live. Library code that keeps an unbound number of strong references in an internal data structure will eventually cause a memory leak if the client code has no way of freeing that data structure itself. That's why we used weak references for the internal data structure. It is then the client code's sole responsibility to keep the strong references as long as needed but not (much) longer. This concept is orthogonal to OOP.
I wrote a quick and dirty benchmark and memory consumption was indeed smaller when using weak references (about one order of magnitude compared to a dictionary containing strong references). Sure, we still keep strong references to those weak references themselves but if the size of the objects is much larger than the size of weak references this should not be a problem. Things get trickier when the keys are weak references too. I suppose in that case you will need something like a WeakMap in Javascript that has to be implemented at least partially in unmanaged code.
Well Turkish is a wonderful language but it is Greek to me.
I have the same question too. Some people sound quite enthusiastic but I just do not get it. What do you get out of reddit data? What interesting stuff is in there? 
&gt; Sure, we still keep strong references to those weak references themselves but if the size of the objects is much larger than the size of weak references this should not be a problem. Ah yes. That makes sense, thanks.
That's amazing! Nice job!
I’ve used the api and powershell to get data for personal use, I guess I was just wondering what a library would be used for and how people would use it. 
Wrong thread?
Dapper, I've not used it myself but had it repeatedly recommended to me and it appears to support MySql. I think it can be found here: https://stackexchange.github.io/Dapper/ 
cheerse mate :)
Its C
I got it. My code logic is just wrong. 
It's more than just retrieving data. You can also create new posts/comments/subreddits, view/send private messages/modmail, moderate subreddits, update your user profile/settings, etc. Basically, almost anything that can be done on the main Reddit website can also be done from any .NET codebase using this new library. This library can be used to create anything from a simple console bot to a fully-featured Reddit mobile app. 
You want people to watch an 8 hour video with no description or explanation why?
No problem, glad that this helped!
Uh... you're trying to make a control by using a ResourceDictionary? I think you need to go back to WPF fundamentals and learn how to use controls, then make a custom control or UserControl.
I just uploaded a video demonstrating the Example app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrOzg3IFr8c I recommend you enable subtitles before viewing. 
Thanks!
&gt;ive tried creating multiple labels based on the texted you want it to display and using dispatchers to move those labels' margin like an animation, but cant get the label working correctly There are such a concept as [animations in WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/animation-overview). And blend makes it pretty easy using the timeline. This is just silly.
Some nice syntax that would otherwise be a helper class anti pattern 
its ok, i don't blame you. Just want other "devs" to read that this though a solution, is a BAAAAD solution
Hi. I did see your other post. But a little more information for user's who didn't see your first post would be nice ;)
Thats right, but you never know for sure that a dev did his homework calling .ConfigureAwait(false) in all his libraries. We had a few problems regarding closed-source libraries, which were "optimized for Async" which did not use .ConfigureAwait(false) and offered Events to subscribe leading to many portions of our code needing workarounds until i contacted them and told them that their stuff does not work. But they insisted that it works in their unit-tests. Obviously since there is no SynchronisationContext.
Mods must be asleep/away, there's a lot of blog/tutorial spam ATM.
I'd hire you if you actually did do that in a joking way. I'll check this out tomorrow and send feedback.
RemindMe! 24 hours 
Hi again, you need an observable collection https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1427471/observablecollection-not-noticing-when-item-in-it-changes-even-with-inotifyprop public class CollectionViewModel : ViewModelBase { public ObservableCollection&lt;EntityViewModel&gt; ContentList { get { return _contentList; } set { _contentList = value; RaisePropertyChanged("ContentList"); //I want to be notified here when something changes..? //debugger doesn't stop here when IsRowChecked is toggled } }
Yielding methods are executed upon iteration. Async methods are executed immediately. What about yielding async methods?
 I'm sorry, man, I don't know Greek. 
&gt; (If all other objects stop referring to the event's publisher, but the event is still attached, it has "leaked" because the GC won't ever collect it. So keep a local copy of the publisher reference so you can detach events when you're done with them.) Don't you mean the other way around? The publisher has a strong reference to the subscriber because of the event subscription. So that means that the subscriber can't be collected until the subscription has been removed. The publisher can always be collected if there are no references anymore but the subscribers can't because they are referenced by the publisher. If the publisher will be long living and the subscribers short living, you need to make sure you remove the subscription when you are done with it. Otherwise the subscribers will "leak". If the publisher has the same lifetime as the subscribers, then it is not really needed because then the whole reference graph/island can be collected in one go.
Looks cool. It does however look like a lot of memory is being used for a small console application, do you have a memory leak somewhere?
I believe the method will be executed immediately and the result will be yielded.
you mean 70mo? 
I've submitted a PR, but here's the travis configuration (added to .travis.yml in the project root) for those curious: language: csharp mono: none dotnet: 2.1 before_script: - cd src - dotnet restore script: - dotnet build --no-restore --no-incremental - dotnet test Builds will fail on `dotnet test` due to the required account configuration so if this is something you want to pursue you'll need to rethink how that works.
Can you share an example? Because I don't think I understand where you'd like to end up with this.
OK, bear with me, this is a bit over my head, but I'm trying to learn. Do you prefer {get;} because state changes can cause complex side effects? Am I right to think that this would be a functional programming approach? What about changing the state of members internally? Or is the goal immutability everywhere. Basically I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on any aspect of this that you want to expound on.
Unfortunately, nearly all of the OAuth endpoints require an authenticated user. An app ID and at least one (preferably two) refresh tokens are required at the API level so it's not a requirement that I have the ability to remove.
This mostly applies to pre-condition checks. Here's an example: Bad code: IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; FilterOdds(this IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; source) { if (source == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(source)); foreach (var i in source) { if (i % 2 == 0) yield i; } } The issue here is that calling `FilterOdds(null)` will work just fine and **not** throw an exception, even tho an invalid argument was passed. That is because the method will only be executed once you start to iterate. A better solution is: IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; FilterOdds(this IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; source) { if (source == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(source)); return Aux(); IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Aux() { foreach (var i in source) { if (i % 2 == 0) yield i; } } }
There's a lot of raw API data being monitored here. You'll notice that's when the memory spikes occur, but I don't see any evidence of a leak. I could be wrong, but I think it's just that.
This is a test app for the [Reddit.NET library](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/aknbwl/the_redditnet_library_is_now_open_for_beta/).
Yeah I just realized that, as well. I've since added a comment with a link to the current thread.
I'm not suggesting that you remove the tests; you can add credentials to Travis as environment variables and fetch them from there (even using a pool of accounts if needed) or potentially create them on the fly.
Yeah, i'm learning MVC right now. Its seems no that hard and better structured than webforms. Thank you
I tried and keeps giving me an error of string or something. \~mooving to MVC. thanks for the reply
Yes, it is the other way around. But the practical point I was making still stands. It's hard to get an object to unsubscribe itself from a publisher it no longer holds a reference to.
Strange, this should work, you may need additional info as so: &lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhyAAiALM...DfD0QAADs=" /&gt;
&gt; but you can test your code using mocks without having to contact a remote server. Something to think about. It's something I've considered, but sometimes changes that don't break locally can sometimes cause unexpected behaviors from the API that would be breaking, and the only way I know of to reliably catch that is with live testing. I would be open to adding something like what you describe in addition to the existing tests, so long as somebody else does the work. I've made a conscious decision to farm test cleanup/enhancements/etc to the dev community. =)
big fan of dapper
I'll not be able to just put the binary there, because its a listview. I should use eval instead right ? 
I'd be curious to see what the memory usage is if you're not constantly monitoring a really popular sub. 
Hey a quick question. Your other post intrigued me but I just haven't had time to look. I'm still using the old api that reddit originally had. Can you use this to post via an account? Basically, I have a bot account for a sub I manage that handles posting scheduled stuff. Can you do that with this? If so I'm going to dig into it. 
Yes you can use this library to do pretty much anything the API supports, including creating new posts. Check out the main thread for more details.
I figured as much but just wanted to make sure before I grabbed the code. I've been wanting to redo my bot anyways. Thanks!
Awesome, I only scanned the video, but the moment I saw monitoring, I knew I had to check it out. Do you refresh on an update loop? Or is your app getting notified of updates?
What do you mean you “can’t gat a line of script to work”? Share more details of what went wrong
If you use data binding you should be able to just examine / update the properties of the view model for each row.
Don't buy into the mythos. I know great programmers who don't touch any of it.
Search and replace needs to done at the data layer, not the UI layer. Implement it as a method on your ItemsSource class.
It has the same behavior as non-async `yield`: your method code is deferred until the first MoveNext() is called.
Thank you for the clarification.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/unity2d] [Brand new to Unity, &amp; c#](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/al174o/brand_new_to_unity_c/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
This. A command should call back to the VM and the VM to some generic implementation for easier reuse across view models. You could also do this as a behavior if you wanted the ability to do find and replace plugged in via the xaml and have it divorced from the concept of the VM (useful if you are following "true" mvvm).
It shouldn't matter if you're using visual studio or visual studio code. If one has your preference you can change it by going to preferences in Unity. Can you explain a bit more of what you're doing and what is going wrong?
Yeah, if the state change is happening because you are doing something in the business logic, it makes more sense to keep it local to the class. Otherwise you have "managers" everywhere in the codebase. Any time you are dealing with multithreading, I think you need to be readonly, and giving out completely new instances of classes to be safer. I personally like immutability/ private by default.
The library uses an asynchronous event-based approach. The app developer simply calls the library's appropriate monitoring method then writes a callback function to handle changes to the data (like a new or deleted post). When the data being returned by the API changes, an event is triggered that calls your callback function and passes the relevant data (for example, lists of any posts that were added or removed since the last query).
In the video, you can see the memory usage before the monitoring begins. It seems to start pretty low, then climbs as I start pulling in more API data. Looks like it peaks at just shy of 30 MB before the monitoring begins.
I'm not sure what you mean. I thought the whole point if this static analysis is that is guaranteed, if you use it that way. So if you turn on this feature in your settings, and if you treat warnings as errors, and it compiles, doesn't that mean you are guaranteed at compile time that there will be no runtime null reference exceptions? Or are you referring to some strange edge cases where it is not completely guaranteed?
Yea I figured as much. I monitor a much less active sub in a similar manner and ended up just running my program every 5 min and pulling a max of like 1k comments or something. I found it to be a much more efficient use of resources and in my use case, the last 5k comments is always plenty.

Hi, I had observable collections created by filmBindingSource.DataSource = dao.mKino.Film.Local; See: namespace DemoKino { public partial class Main : Form { DAO.DAO dao = new DAO.DAO(); public Main() { InitializeComponent(); } protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e) { base.OnLoad(e); dao.Load(); filmBindingSource.DataSource = dao.mKino.Film.Local; saalBindingSource.DataSource = dao.mKino.Saal.Local; vorfuehrungBindingSource.DataSource = dao.mKino.Vorfuehrung.Local; buchungBindingSource.DataSource = dao.mKino.Buchung.Local; } Anyway I tried to understand the article you linked and the idea of MVVM but I don't get it what I should do with another observable collection. Also how do I convert (cast) the observable collection of type System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection&lt;[DAO.Film](https://DAO.Film)\&gt; created by mKino.Film.Local to the ContentList property type System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection&lt;EntityViewModel&gt; of the viewmodel? &amp;#x200B; This app is not WPF but WinForms. Is it still correct to use a MVVM pattern?
How new are you to programming? I am self taught and I recommend the resources Microsoft has online and the C# in a Nutshell books by J &amp; B Albahari. They continue to updated them 6.0, 7.0, etc.; but are just updates of one another. I wouldn't recommend jumping into Unity without first becoming acclimated with C#.
Our recommendations of the [best C# books](https://reactdom.com/csharp).
It's not clear from the original article, but according to your description this is basically an object cache / pool implementation, which also guarantees some memory management with the help of `WeakReference&lt;T&gt;`. Which leads to a conclusion that the article is presenting a "problem" without elaborating all aspects/requirements. The article is solution-oriented, spending very little time on elaborating the problem itself. To be more specific, according to my analysis, there actually 3 requirements which should be mentioned before jumping to the conclusion. 1. Pooling of possibly heavy weighted objects 2. Freeing up unused memory automatically 3. Controlling the construction of the pooled objects (eg. by hiding the constructor) I'm pretty sure that there are much better ways to handle these requirements together. In the form presented in the article, this is an antipattern just like Singleton. Presenting articles like this to beginners encourages bad programming practices.
&gt;Memory consumption (and possibly leaks). This is addressed by the `WeakReference&lt;T&gt;` itself. No need for additional "patterns" &gt;WeakReferences are strongly typed. This has nothing to do with “anti-OOP”. I'm talking about the consumer site. The consumer should "reference" the pooled objects with `string` keys. Strongly-typed becomes [stringly-typed](https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/). See my other comment too!
I currently have the idea to add another binding between an observable collection of the viewmodel and the observable collection of the datamodel. However I was coding for over 14 hours now because I started programming today at 03:00 AM in the morning, stopped at 03:00 PM and continued on this private learning home project until 6:30 PM. It is time to call it a day and try this another day.
You should not start with unity scripting. Write simple console stuff. Write a program that counts your mp3 files and stuff like that.
Removed: Rule 5.
Removed: Rule 4.
I've never seen await on for each. I'm trying to find examples online but I can't find any others?
It's because it's new. It doesn't compile in the current stable release of c#
It's new in the C#8 proposal. [https://github.com/Dasync/AsyncEnumerable](https://github.com/Dasync/AsyncEnumerable)
Is .NET Core 3 the most exciting thing to happen to .NET in years? Feels like it to me.
I can second this, I’ve been doing a lot of unity tutorials and such and man I’m just so lost that I quit unity until I get a better understanding of c#
I don't understand. They say "It includes new features in .NET Core 3.0 and C# 8" but then if you try to download the SDK it says "Supports C# 7.3". So which is it?
That's probably just not been updated, it works with the C# 8 beta just fine.
It's weird. On macOS I can't get nullable references to work: &lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;NullableReferenceTypes&gt;true&lt;/NullableReferenceTypes&gt; &lt;LangVersion&gt;8.0&lt;/LangVersion&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors&gt; &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; 
The setting changed to &lt;NullableContextOptions&gt;enable&lt;/NullableContextOptions&gt;
Do yourself a massive favour and learn mvvm with regard to wpf. It's pretty much how it's designed to be used and makes everything a lot easier than trying to work in the ui.
.NET Core was it already, even the first version.
 In [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) webform protected void SendEmail(object sender, EventArgs e) { using (MailMessage mm = new MailMessage(txtEmail.Text, txtTo.Text)) { mm.Subject = txtSubject.Text; mm.Body = txtBody.Text; if (fuAttachment.HasFile) { string FileName = Path.GetFileName(fuAttachment.PostedFile.FileName); mm.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(fuAttachment.PostedFile.InputStream, FileName)); } mm.IsBodyHtml = false; SmtpClient smtp = new SmtpClient(); smtp.Host = "smtp.gmail.com"; smtp.EnableSsl = true; NetworkCredential NetworkCred = new NetworkCredential(txtEmail.Text, txtPassword.Text); smtp.UseDefaultCredentials = true; smtp.Credentials = NetworkCred; smtp.Port = 587; smtp.Send(mm); ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(GetType(), "alert", "alert('Email sent.');", true); } } //In MVC &amp;#x200B; public static Boolean SendingMail(string From, string To, string Subject, string Body) { try { MailMessage m = new MailMessage("Uma&lt;test@gmail.com&gt;", To); m.Subject = Subject; m.Body = Body; m.IsBodyHtml = true; m.From = new MailAddress(From); m.To.Add(new MailAddress(To)); SmtpClient smtp = new SmtpClient(); smtp.Host = "smtp.gmail.com"; NetworkCredential authinfo = new NetworkCredential("test@gmail.com","password"); smtp.UseDefaultCredentials = false; smtp.Credentials = authinfo; smtp.Send(m); return true; } catch (Exception ex) { return false; } } 
Razor components sound super exciting, can't wait for weekends to get my hands on em
Thanks
Linq2Db support several RDBMs, incluing MySql.
 People usually learn more when they're enjoying it. I think it's perfectly fine to start with games. They won't be architectural masterpieces, and you'll probably start new projects all the time, but if it's what you find fun, do it. I know too many people that got recommended to learn console programming and now not only are they frustrating during the learning process, they're bored because it's not exciting.
isnt that just MVC with extra steps? 
From the little I've seen it looks like Angular/React but written in razor markup and C#. Great if you love SPA's but hate javascript. &amp;#x200B;
Sounds more like using Blazor without web assembly.
Please turn the little Github hearts off. Each example is posthumously punctuated. It draws the eye in a way the eye doesn't need or want to be drawn, to an element that doesn't expect the attention. 
Razor components are actually Blazor.
Taking a quick look I found this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/20066 Looking at what was said, [it's possible that upgrading to .NET Core 2.1 might help](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/20066#issuecomment-386910537) if you can.
&gt;I want the data in bookcode to be side by side with "3" column (updated the photo). You're calling `Fill` on `SqlDataAdapter`. It _will_ try to update existing rows, but it would need to know how to match them. Since it doesn't, this will implicitly create _new_ rows, which is what you're seeing. Quite a few possible solutions to this, including: * swap the code around: select the `InvtID` _first_ and fill an empty DataTable with it, _then_ iterate over its rows to add the corresponding row from the Excel worksheet. * set the `3` column to be the DataTable's primary key, then iterate over the result of your SQL query (using, perhaps, `SqlDataReader` instead, or putting it in a separate DataTable first), and call `Rows.Find()` (passing the value from the `3` column) to match the two. Either way, I don't see how you get around selecting _two_ columns (`InvtID` _and_ `Barcode`), because while your query does return only matching rows, it doesn't do so in a predictable order (unless you 1) explicitly do an `ORDER BY` in the statement, _and_ 2) know the Excel worksheet to be ordered as well).
They are _server-side_ Blazor. They use WebSockets to pass input events to the server, run the Blazor code on the server end, and stream the results back. The classic Blazor model runs on the client, and requires WebAssembly. This does not.
Yeah. When I first saw the embed heart years ago, it was cute; now it's just dumb.
:)
&gt; on the other hand it should be the same as a normal variable -&gt; the scope will be the whole function, isn't it? Late reply, but exactly, this shouldn't be confusing to anyone familiar to normal scoping.
That's the thing, I'm quite confident with C# and just make an assumption of how it works. Previously I knew that the scope of a disposable variable is limited to ”{},” now I’m guessing it (mainly because the example wasn't so good)
Yeah, Js has it's strong points and all but it is no C#. 
Excited for version 1.0! As a user of a library I really need to have better commit messages though, to be able to check the commits to see if any of them are related to a bug I might be experiencing, or similar. When looking at your commit history it is very hard for me to get any insight into what was actually changed in each commit. Example: [https://i.imgur.com/FdDBNC3.png](https://i.imgur.com/FdDBNC3.png)
Well it's one single connection between the server and client and a stream of binary interactions back and forth between them. I think there are some edge cases that will perform horribly (think tab with tons of content that adds/removes from the DOM = large transfer every time). But in most cases, it might actually be decently snappy and the bonus of keeping all your logic in one code base (that isn't Javascript) is very tempting.
Think of it more like partial views encapsulated in a function. The attributes/props are the function's parameters. It's pretty nice after having used React.
I agree it's annoying.
I wonder how easy it would be to convert web forms to razor components. 
offtopic, but I love MahApps Metro. Makes apps so much prettier.
Google failed me ok! When I googled it, it seemed like everyone on stackoverflow and else where was yelling "resource dictionary" instead of UserControls.
Half of my screen taken up by ads, no thank you
The tutorial is actually very good and easy to understand. Yes, the tutorial is 8 hours, but nobody told you to watch it in one sitting. If you’re trying to learn C# this is a great video to start with. 
Liked and followed!
Thank you for your support and feedback !
That is valuable feedback both for my writing and my coding. Thank you!
Heh yeah I can sometimes be a bit lazy on my commit messages on smaller revisions, especially where I believe it to be clear at a quick glance of the commit diff what's being done (gitk is really useful for this!). I've seen some devs waste surprising amounts of time typing up commit messages that are sometimes longer than the code, itself. I personally try to adhere to a more balanced approach that satisfies (or at least tries to satisfy) both concerns.
You need to understand the absolute basics (and way more) before you can enjoy coding games with an engine like unity.
Seems like a lot of work to go through just to avoid client side programmability.
Might want to ease up on the self-promotion, buddy. A little isn't bad, but when I see three of your posts in a row, that's probably not a good thing.
Ok sounds good I will keep it to one per day :) 
*\*WebForms Postback PTSD flashback\**
Thanks DasWorbs!
Why not keep only the em-tags instead of replacing? Why using regex? Regex is not the tool for the job
How can I do that? :)
Yes, I'm not asking for an essay in each commit, just a bit more than "tweak" or "wooops". :)
Can you explain a bit more? I don't understand the case.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Can I write this code in a better way? &gt; &gt;foreach (var highlight in [hit.Highlights.Select](https://hit.Highlights.Select)(d =&gt; d.Value.Highlights)) &gt; &gt;{ &gt; &gt;preview = highlight.FirstOrDefault().ToString().ToNoHtmlString(); &gt; &gt;} &amp;#x200B;
&gt;I guess you could add safety checks inside the upperX setter You got it there. It's called a mutator method if you want to do some reading on it.
What's the type of hit, and Highlights? I'd go for something like this but it's difficult without having more code. var result = hit.Highlights .SelectMany(kvp =&gt; kvp.Value.Highlights) .Select(highlight =&gt; highlight.FirstOrDefault().ToString().ToNoHtmlString()) .ToArray();
Validity checks, value conversion, event invocations etc can all be put in custom getters and setters. Also makes it a property, not a field. (But I'm not sure exactly what that entails) 
Are you able to get the results you want directly in SQL? I don't think this is a C# specific question. Once you have the SQL query it will be straight forward to convert. Faster to test that way too. 
A property is basically a Field with getters and setters. public int MyProp { get; set; } // basically Equals (iirc. you can even invoke the X_get and X_set using reflection) private int MyProp; public int MyProp_get() { return MyProp;} public int MyProp_set(int value) { MyProp = value;} &amp;#x200B;
You probably need `Grouping` and/or a custom `CollectionViewSource` for what you want.
For me personally, I find it useful for events, specifically for doing X when property Y changes, by implementing INotifyPropertyChange interface. For example, in a WPF application, if you want your app to be sorta “real time” and reflect any changes in your underlying property values on the screen, you’ll need to use that. There’s also something very related called “Data Binding” which also utilizes properties, although I’m not sure if you can do it via just public fields. 
I can't really tell by looking at the code, but it should be easy to debug. Print out sb.ToString() before you assign it to cmd.CommandText, and test it in SQL and see what results you get. Find one case where it's not showing the data you want to see, and dig around to figure out why. Keep doing this till all the data looks right, and put your changes back in your C# code.
I think the safest bet is to use an HTML-parser to walk through the HTML and process the text that way.
Next line { } in the preview pic, all I had to see.
Yes, because of my work, I have to use "software" built by people like you. Thankfully, that also keeps me employed, as the "pick up the slack and get something with a proper UI to replace that web shit".
Encapsulation and information hiding, future proofing. Using a property instead of a field lets you: * abstract the property out as part of an `interface` type * define the property to be computed, fire events, perform validation, etc without changing how it's used by calling code * control access to reading and writing the property value separately, e. g. `public int Foo { get; private set; }` * make the property virtual, allowing derived classes to change the implementation themselves Using a field lets you: * pass the field as a `ref` or `out` parameter. Given that the difference between declaring something as a public field and a public, auto-implemented property is pretty minimal, there's substantial advantages to using properties over fields in almost every case. I think the major case where fields win out is when it's `private`. `public` and `protected` data should probably be properties, by default.
Woops.
&gt;Yet, using it with a Private variable means typing twice the code If you don't know already you actually dont have to type all the code out. You can "prop" then press tab 2 times for a simple property. Or type "propfull" then press tab 2 times for a private backed property. Can also do this for for loops and some other pieces of code
Data binding only works with properties I am pretty sure, not public fields

i know bro ,but i can't do any thing about it , am gust consuming a service API, i have told the project leader , and he will talk to the service provider 
What do you mean?
 Foo() { } Instead of Bar() { }
Its not javascript, its c#
i know, that's why I prefer next line brackets
VS does this by default, just sayin
Are you following MVVM pattern and binding to ViewModel? Most of your "code behind" stuff probably belongs there...
The amount and quality of your questions is astonishing.
In addition to the reasons given by Canthros, using a property (i.e. `public int x { get; set; }`) can also allow you to define a custom getter and setter in the future while making it less likely to break compatibility (binary compatibility, compatibility with reflection-based code that uses the property, etc.). Changing from a field to a property is much more likely to break things.
This really, you should probably use the MVVM pattern, I think in a lot of ways it makes things a lot cleaner and a lot more testable but it may mean a bit more leg work in the short term. Using something like MVVM Light will make it easier. If you stick to the MVVM pattern it should mean that you end up with practically no code in the code behind and good separation between parts of your application (pages, user controls, etc). 
looks similar to how Dotnetify works. 
Ah, that's really useful to know. Thanks!
If I understand correctly what you are trying to acheive, then here are some libraries which may help https://www.nuget.org/packages/NMF-Expressions/ https://www.nuget.org/packages/OLinq/ 
A property doesn't necessarily need a backing field. At the lowest level a property is just one or two hidden methods.
Sometimes (when I'm feeling like a bad developer) I'll quick-wire a property to a member of a field. Like this: private Textbox _whatever; // gets initialized properly in ctor, ignore that it's null :) public string MyObjectHasTextButNotReally { get { return _whatever.Text; } set { _whatever.Text = value; } }
You should just do you query plainly first. Retrieve the data from the database, move the data into a list of objects in your code, then in your display logic check if the list is empty. Use that to show the “no data”. 
How does this work? Any movie for free or does it hook up to many other services and require logins?
A simple `if(dt.Rows.Count == 0)` near the end of your code should be enough to handle the empty DataTable as a special case.
Not sure how the titles are selected, but when you select a movie then it will use some torrent to download the movie. Depending on where you live this may be legal or not... &amp;#x200B;
If you're running SQL Server, it comes with SSRS. From there, you can use the ReportServer object (Microsoft.Reporting.Common, IIRC) to connect, run, and export a report in any number of formats, PDF included.
so much excite!! so many new awesome things being released consistently and frequently. it's awesome.
No login required, it uses the YTS API (torrent) behind.
I'm assuming it's at best legally shady in the US
PDFSharp has been around for a while, open source. [https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp](https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp)
Brave calling your own app brilliant. ;) It is good looking though!
From an architectural perspective, there is nothing different between putting your code in the XAML or code-behind. They are both going to be compiled into the same class. As a general rule, code should be separated as such: * Data models: Things that are purely data go into the models. This includes validation, calculated fields, and the like. Push as much as you can down to this level because this where unit testing is easy. * View models: This is where abstract things about the views go. Things like which item is currently selected. Keep in mind this MVVM concept: a view-model describes a view or set of views. * View models: This is also where integration components go because... well where else are you going to put them. * Views: XAML+Code behind. This is where you deal with the messy stuff needed for the UI itself. Event handlers, custom value converters, data binding infrastructure, dynamically loading controls, etc. You'll find that for simple applications, you'll have often have little or no code-behind. Often it is just stuff like opening modal dialog windows (which you could do in the view-model, but that technically breaks the pattern and makes testing harder). As the application gets more complex, you'll find that you are creating your own custom controls, either by extending existing ones or completely from scratch. These will require a lot of code-behind. 
I program mainly with C# and wanted to experiment a little bit with gaming. For what type of games is Unity (very) good and for what types (very) bad? &amp;#x200B; I have zero experience with Unity...
Unity is good for any type of game, it used to be that it was best for 3D games but now they gotten way to far into the 2D toolset, VR toolset, and they include support for almost every single type of platform. 
Looks like Dotnetify still uses a JavaScript client-side SPA framework like Vue. Blazor instead _is_ an SPA framework (in C# instead of JavaScript).
Are you going to use automated testing at the view-model level? This is an important decision. If no, then your view-models can 'know' about windows and dialogs. This makes designing your application a lot easier because VMs can just open things directly. But it also makes testing the view-models without the views impossible. So I wouldn't recommend it on larger projects where you have the time and staff for more comprehensive testing.
Looks like a decent way of hiding implementation details..!
https://github.com/itext/itextsharp Or if you can generate pretty HTML you can use Ghostscript to Concert IT to PDF. 
I mean the communication between server and client, DontNetify uses SignalR.
Thanks, sounds promising. I just programmed one game in a small team in college as a project. It was fun but only with the MonoGame-Framework. Should I know some things/differences between Unity and MonoGame before I start?
Because all your classes are in the same namespace
Can you screenshot or paste your code here? It would be easier to understand your problem.
If you don't mind me piggybacking off this: Do you know of any decent tutorials for setting up a bare bones 2d game with a civ like framework (simultaneous turn based game)? I was looking to just get a map down and build the turn framework, but hit a few snags, and all the tutorials I can find are either way farther down the line or assume you want to be making platformers and the like.
But now it uses sockets :P
Still no information about standalone single exe bundles with runtime embedded inside. This is the thing I want most but two previews in and multiple blog posts later we still have no details.
&gt;Giraffe I fail to see how this is so different from interfaces. If anything, this looks like a terrible example of the problems with oop.

I don't see the productivity gain at all. You'll be writing the same exact unit tests in F# as you would in C#. Logic is logic, no matter the language. It's how your language receives the logic is what's different between the two languages. Pure functions have nothing to do with your algorithms, and although they give predictability (maybe?), unit tests will guarantee a more bug free application. If you followed a more domain driven design (or onion architecture) then you should be pushing towards immutability for your valueobjects and logic in your entities (zero dependencies). Same predictability as pure functions. Bring in the failed OOP F# hipsters...
Is it actually expecting JSON in the URL? Or a bunch of querystring key/value parameters? If it is really expecting JSON in the URL (yuck), you probably need to URL encode it before sending it.
this is right, atleast for a readonly Property :)
Properties become methods. They can be inlined, but if they don't then they typically return a copy of their backing field (defensive copying). This is why you can't use them as `ref` parameters, because they don't return the backing field. Properties can return by reference, though. You might wonder why this matters. Well, methods calls on structs have a hidden parameter, which is the struct itself. This parameter is the struct passed by reference `ref`. However, properties are methods, and you can't pass a value by reference unless the method returns by reference. So, the compiler will put a copy of the struct (defensive copying) onto the call stack, and that copy of the struct will be passed by reference. The result is that the copy is modified, but the original struct is not. This implicit copying of structs is one reason why it's commonly suggested to not use mutable structs (unless you know what you're doing). I personally think this should throw a warning, but for some reason it doesn't.
As the person previously said - they are in the same namespace. Same applies to classes in different folders, you just have to keep them within the same namespace.
You can configure it tbf, to each their own
Seconded. If you're not patient enough to write a basic console program or don't find any pleasure in it, you are likely just one of many individuals seeking instant gratification without any blood, sweat, and tears. I've ran into too many "I want to develop games for a living" yahoos who could barely pass algebra class.
So what's the deal with WinForms-support? Are WinForms supported on every platform with 3.0 (like Swing from Java) or are they are Windows-dependent extension that ties the application to Windows?
If you work entirely with your own code, there's only a few edge cases where it won't blow up. However, if you work with libraries that don't use non-nullable reference types, there's no way to know what type of values they're gonna throw at you.
Have you tried the following? It may fix any encoding issues that might be occurring. var request = new RestRequest("edupro/apis/addstd/{json}", Method.GET); request.AddUrlSegment("json", json); 
I haven't, but it sounds like a good use case for razor pages.
The “using &lt;namespace&gt;” is required when the class/strict/etc. Is not in the current namespace or one of its parents. So if you put a `ClassA` in `NamespaceA` and `ClassB` in `NamespaceA.NamespaceB`, you can access ClassA within ClassB without a using statement, but you cannot access ClassB in ClassA without adding `using NamespaceA.NamespaceB;` to the top or specifying the full class name, which is `NamespaceA.NamespaceB.ClassB` (There is a small exception to specifying the full class name, and that is that you do not need to include the default namespace of the project)
Windows dependent
What is the cost of Azure in this case vs free at GitHub? I admit to having thought about doing this but the value isn't terribly high to me.

Having to deploy a backend for a static site is pretty wasteful and a lot of maintenance. A pure HTML/CSS site would be a more appropriate tool if the content really is static. If you want a CMS of some sort then it might make sense, but there are ways to achieve this just with a github repo and a static site hosted there.
I solved this case with a viewmodel containing a refreshable observable collection. Thanks for help!

I wouldn't use it for that. For static content like that I'd personally use something else like Jekyll. Hosting a static site is cheaper, so unless you need to do something server side, I'd keep it simple.
So unless you want to build it as a learning experience, use a CMS for this. If you want to go .net DotNetNuke is a good one, otherwise wordpress. 
Came here to say this. OP is mixing UI logic concerns with data access.
I had a personal blog hosted in .net core 1, but its MVC and it didnt cost me anything. mainly I didnt want to learn a new static site generator so I liked just having a _Layout.cshtml for all my "blog posts". Its been down for months though, hence my idea to rewrite in Razor Pages and host in Azure again, just because its so damn easy Although the only traffic was friends/family that I showed, so idk the cost if you hit like 1000 users a day.
could look into generating a PDF via SSRS
This makes me wonder how viable a .Net + razor based static sight generator similar to Jekyll would be. It seems we're all on the same page, servers cost money and it's hard to justify setting one up when you can run a basic static site off a git repository for free.
Since you said that 3d drawings are a goal for the project I would say that unity is the way to go. Yes you can use WPF to do 3d but its not really what it was designed for.
Just tried gitlab. it sucks. instead of lostmaterial.gitlab.io it has to be something like lostmaterial.gitlab.io/plain-html/ the last part of the url being whatever project you forked for gitlabs static site generation (like jekylll). doesnt look very professional.
Where were/are you hosting .net core mvc app for free? 
Look at Netlify for hosting, and use GitHub and a static site generator like Hugo. Cost=free. You get a build server, fast, almost zero maintenance, good security and a free CDN. 
azure. using the "shared" free plan. you have to have a credit card on file though. only drawback (and hence why I ended it).
sweet, i dont use github, use gitlab, but it looks like i can use that with their site
You can use a custom domain and/or don't need the project name in the URL. Look at group pages here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_one.html#user-and-group-websites
 https://wyam.io/ 
Yes, I use gitlab with Netlify and Hugo myself. Works great.
Same, I have been waiting excitedly since they first announced it
This social network-like crap on github is extremely unprofessional
If you have super small traffic, it won't matter much. However, as soon as you have a single post that gets some moderate attention, you'll wish you had gone static. It's just a matter of math. One article going viral (which you can't prevent) and your "basically free" dynamic site hosting is now costing you hundreds or thousands of dollars on something you're probably not monetizing. Best case scenario, your host just limits your traffic and you have bunch of angry readers bitching about your site being down.
If you're using Visual Studio, it can depend on how you created the class. If you create the class in the main project and then move it to the folder, it will be in the same namespace as the project and you can use it right away. If you right click on the folder and create the class, Visual Studio creates the class in "PROJECTNAME.DIRECTORYNAME" namespace, and then you have to use a "using" directive to use it. In most of my personal projects, I've created the classes and then moved them to folders so I wouldn't have to deal with the different namespaces. However, as I've been doing some MVVM courses, I've found that having the different namespaces can actually be kind of nice for keeping Intellisense clean.
I think the laziest way is to use auto-properties and not declare a field at all! `public string CoolestProperty { get; set; }`
Ok you won the lazy competition hehe and yes that’s correct !
Try to use DinkToPdf Library
App service?
The issue with that is that unity isn't going to serialize the property in the inspector, which makes it annoying if you want to be able to edit values in there. If you want that functionality you should do the same as the guy in the video, where you declare a private variable and create a public property, then add the \[SerializeField\] attribute to the variable if you want to be able to change it in the inspector. Note adding that attribute to the property won't do anything. Another thing to mention is that a property can be seen in the inspector if you put it in debug mode, it won't however serialize it.
C# has conventions that I strongly recommend you stick to, you filthy animal [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions#layout-conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions#layout-conventions)
Having maintained an SSRS instance for several years, that's been responsible for generating PDF reports, I'm going to have to disagree. Unless your happy with your PDFs looking like shit because the templating tool is terrible, or having to code in vbscript to do any further transformations on the data returned by your queries. Check out WkhtmlToPdf, if you can render your data in HTML and style it with CSS, then think of WkhtmlToPdf as a browser that instead of displaying the webpage in a window, it renders it in a PDF document. There's a wrapper for it called Rotativa which has a lot of helpers for rendering razor views of you want to use MVC.
Ah that does make a difference, I'm not too familiar with Unity. It looks like adding field attributes to auto properties was [introduced in C# 7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3#attach-attributes-to-the-backing-fields-for-auto-implemented-properties) though
I love itextsharp and it is my go to! Just realize, it may have licensing requirements depending upon how you use it.
Look at Gastby. It's a static site generator based on React. Easy to use, and it optimizes the pages for you so long as you follow a few conventions.
Only shame is you can’t map a custom DNS to it. 
The one thing I miss from C++ has been staring me in the face for years... 
I didn’t know using statements were a thing earlier today. I want them so bad now. 
Not a fan of that change. I predict it is going to cause more problems, with object (such as streams, transactions, etc.) not being disposed when they should (too late). Just for the sake of saving one level of indentation.
Most people made using statements span the entire method anyway, so this won't change anything. And if you prefer the old way, you can still use braces
If you are comfortable converting HTML to PDF, you can try out my service - built on AWS Lambda and supports headless chrome: https://www.github.com/api2pdf/api2pdf.dotnet
I'm having a hard time thinking of any example in my code where that will be an issue. Can you offer one from one of your?
Can you elaborate on what you mean by getting back 5.89? If you’re looking at the value of the int variable, that would be impossible (as you were expecting). 
I'm curious if this will eventually lead to elision of the using statement entirely, and readding it as part of the first pass of the compiler if your object can be disposed of 
&gt; I want them so bad now. You mean the new shorthand? Because the braces syntax has always been a thing, 
You lose readability and a clear delineation of when the resource is being disposed. I think it may also reinforce some bad behaviours, like capturing more processing and keeping the relevant resource alive for much longer than it needs to be. It's nice syntactic sugar, but I have to agree that it's not worth sacrificing that ability to save a few lines of code. But, I also agree that this works well in some environments, so I'm glad to have it.
The object is disposed when the variable goes out of scope. Am I talking about the old or new syntax?
It you need to await a separate process in that method call, and don't want your resource tied up as a result, it'll be better to use a using statement for the synchronous work, dispose of the resource, and then await after that disposal. This is used on a few systems I've had to work on that have limited resources and/or specific resources used for only a small piece of the objects life. The using statement allowed for easier readability, and implicit control over when the resource was disposed and freed up for the next object
Yeah, agreed. I'm guessing OP console writes the value of myDoubleVar (5.89) instead of myIntVar (5).
Put a free cloudflare in front of it and cut your hosting costs waaaay down.
That's a fair example. 
Is it possible use it for free?
For the actual game unity would be the most ideal. For any 3d art programs blender is free and has a lot of resources to help you.
Well done congrats!
The article in the link actually has good example where it would be bad: for example keeping a file open for too long.
But this will still be possible, they aren't getting rid of the using braces, just making them optional.
One of those actually exists! It's called Pretzel. I actually use it for my site. Here's Pretzel's GitHub: https://github.com/Code52/pretzel
Not _always_. Dotnet 1 (shivers) didn't have it from memory.
My assumption is I doubt it. I'm not sure what your usage is, to if they have concessions. 
For personality usage only, to do something simple like merging and splitting for personal documents I am curious about do I need to get license key for calling this library? I know some commercial libraries like telerik require license api key before creating dependencies objects 
And? The question was defining a use case you wouldn't want to use the new syntax.
They were introduced in C# 2.0. So it has been a while. Here is a 2004 article. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6564/Understanding-the-using-statement-in-C
The methods you wish to run are on already existing classes, or are written specifically to be executed from your command line?
VB didn't get it until even later, much to my annoyance.
I prefer to refer to the old syntax as "using blocks". I don't understand why people like referring to everything as a "statement" even when it refers to something that is clearly a container for multiple statements.
eh, it is a bit weird - but to be fair, that's what [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement) call it.
That's why I don't complain about it. I gently nudge people once in awhile to my preferred phrasing, but this isn't a fight worth having.
No, they are all grouped in different classes. So for instance, let’s say I have the command *r_draw2D 0*, “r” is the class which stands for Renderer, *draw2D* is the method in the Renderer class which takes a Boolean parameter of 0 or 1. I want to be able to dynamically call a classes containing methods and pass in the parameter. The way I have it setup is that I have a command base class, and each class containing commands is a subclass. Using Reflection I iterate through all the subclasses and add each method to a list as a way to cache the results instead of having to constantly use Reflection. I also use this list for command prediction too since it’s already there and populated. Once the command is typed, and if it exists in the list, I use Reflection again to invoke the command. But one of the issues I have with this due to accessibility and Reflection is that my command methods have to be static. I would prefer everything be private and only the input/parse method which is the first called method be static. This way I can use it everywhere and not have to create a new instance every time I want to run a command.
There's a lgpl version
Yeah there's a license file. You call a license register code api. If you run in evaluation mode you can only add like 3 objects to the page. Be it paragraph image etc. 
Yeah, that's more correct. Universal too.
I'm curious, If the GC deterministically disposed every IDisposable instance at the end of the scope, would that affect the optimization of the GC by breaking up the batches of collection that it was going to perform?
I would guess that in the compilers AST the block node is a child of the using statement node, so kinda makes sense.
Use an interface. You can have a method on the interface called Run(), all commands implement the interface and then you don't need reflection. Also look into Dependency Injection as that will be a cleaner way to obtain the list of all commands
what do u want 5.89 to 6 or 5 ?
Nope. The GC doesn't know about IDisposable, they are completely separate concepts from the runtime's perspective. *** Ok, if the object has a finalizer, the GC knows about it. And the dispose call is supposed to suppress finalization. *** Holding objects in memory longer by waiting to call dispose until the end of the scope could have an effect, but it is unlikely. 1. GC isn't going to run unless you are allocating memory (i.e. using the `new` keyword) 2. A lot of objects can fit into one page of memory, and it shouldn't run the GC before the page is full
I am using the following method in such cases. public async void GetValues(string queryString) { HttpClient client = new HttpClient(); try { jsonString = await client.GetStringAsync(queryString); } catch (Exception ex) { throw; } } and serialize that jsonString.
I wouldn't make anything static here. Instead of storing *methods* in your data structure, store class instances and make the Base command class abstract. The Class instances would then work as stateless singletons. ConsoleCommand class: public abstract string CommandName {get;} public abstract string[] AlternateNames {get;} public abstract string Description {get;} public abstract void Execute(string[] CommandArguments) You would then create a derived class for each command. (Of course Execute() would presumably take some central program instance- something the command can manipulate, like say a game state object). At startup you would index all the Types that are derived from the abstract ConsoleCommand. You would Create an Instance of those classes and add them to a Dictionary indexed by both their Command Name and their AlternateNames. When you evaluate a string you can then check if the first word is a command name by simply seeing if it exists as a key in the Dictionary. If it does than you can retrieve the ConsoleCommand instance of that command and call Execute with any other provided parameters. For say tab completion, you can access the Keys collection of the Dictionary for a full list of commands (Depending on the number of commands it might be worthwhile to build and maintain a tree based index referencing the command singletons (eg "a" contains another tree that contains trees for aa, ab ac, ad as well as references to all commands that start with a, but that's another discussion) 
Never tried Crystal Reports. We work with Microsoft Reporting Services and FastReport. If you want to "dump" data I prefer Microsoft SSRS with a subscription. Otherwise, I strongly recommend FastReport: \- Easy to use design "printable" pages \- Code behind support \- Easy to automate They are not perfect and have some bugs, but overall it seems like the best solution for our fits.
See that's interesting because the entire Unity sub would disagree. You see beginners getting into it through art and into programming every single day. Now how many stay with it, I don't know, but they love doing it, and most of the "look at my games" are people posting how they learned to program and make games in a year to release "x" game, so.
Wonder this too. Would it be worth sorting a big array for binary search or is it a better way?
And what do you want to happen should they be unequal? Stop or continue? Do you check each element against each other or what do you do? You need to provide more information
I thought braces were a ‘feature’ of C#? A lot of this version 8 stuff is getting quite unreadable because of the destruction of the braces.
Basically I am looking for a faster approach for this naive function: int IComparable.CompareTo(T other) { if (arr.Length &lt; other.arr.Legnth) return -1; if (arr.Length &gt; other.arr.Legnth) return 1; for (int i = arr.Length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {// compare each element and return 1 or -1 } return 0;// they are equal if we get here } 
So in this case each element has to match on the same positions? If the arrays are large, perhaps there is something to be done with Vector&lt;uint&gt; but I've never tried myself. Otherwise I'm not sure how to do a faster comparison. 
Even when i tried specified barcode, one with bookcode and one dont hv bookcode. it just print that 1 bookcode only and theres no 'Nodata' cell row 1. var barCodesstring = string.Format("'{0}'", string.Join("','", 9789830093819,9789830094205)); 2. SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("WITH cte AS(SELECT case WHEN InvtID IS NULL OR InvtID = '' THEN 'Nodata' ELSE InvtID END AS InvtID, Barcode, ROW\_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Barcode ORDER BY InvtID Asc) rid FROM InventoryCustomer) SELECT InvtID AS BOOKCODE FROM cte WHERE rid = 1 and Barcode In (" + barCodesstring + ")", conn);
To be nitpicking: you said the code quoted from AzureSignTool couldn't be written using the new feature - that's not quite correct, you just can't write it without the braces. But nothing is keeping you from adding braces around a code block to create a new scope in which you then could use the new using var feature. 
&gt; So in this case each element has to match on the same positions? Yes. 
I suspect not. I can imagine a number of cases,where you create something disposable and do not want it to be disposed at the end of the scope. Here is a slightly contrived example: TextReader OpenFile(string filename) { var stream = File.Open(filename); return new StreamReader(stream, Encoding.UTF8); }
But then you may as well use the old style using block.
Of course. It's just not correct to say that you couldn't use the new feature here. I wouldn't be surprised if some coding guidelines started demanding that you use the new feature causing programmers to use what I described in some places. 
Use unsafe code. Pin it and then do 64-bit compares.
An IDisposable will be garbage collected like everything else, what this does is essentially have the compiler insert the dispose call for you at the end of a function and in an exception safe way, so the GC isn't involved. The GC has gen0 that collects local values very quickly. I don't think it's quite deterministic but it's close.
Currently using aspose which is the bottleneck in the system. Taking over 8 seconds to generate the pdf. It is the fastest out of what we have tried though.
 double myDoubleVar = 5.89; int myIntVar = (int)myDoubleVar; System.Console.WriteLine(myIntVar); // Outputs 5 You're likely printing the wrong variable.
Maybe something like this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42502643/how-to-compare-two-byte-arrays-with-greater-than-or-less-than-operator-value-in
cant upvote this enough 
That's linear complexity. How much faster do you want it to become?
I am looking for the "fastest" way of comparison. `Linq` is the generally slower than anything else. 
Yet it gets downvoted lol. I love the braces aspect of C# (along with many other reasons in general for using C#) because it does make it so readable, it's clearly marks beginnings and ends of scopes.
It cannot, as there are many times where you want IDisposable objects to survive outside the scope.
I am just exploring alternative options to squeeze as much performance as I can out of this method since it is going to be called multiple times from other functions which will then be called many times. 
&gt; -HTML to PDF then printing this might be easiest (and cheap) solution if you don't really need enterprise-level reporting capabilities (like fully-featured end-user report designer) in your .NET app.
user.UserName = "bob@bob.com" user.Email = "bob@bob.com"
&gt;1. A lot of objects can fit into one page of memory, and it shouldn't run the GC before the page is ful So if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that, breaking up that page of memory by disposing a block of memory that's inside of that page, wouldn't disturb the final GC process? 
Thankfully it's optional! Make a linting rule for your team that they can't use this :) 
Well, it is technically a statement, since the block is encapsulated within the statement. It's petty semantics though.
I feel C# is getting ugly.
Have you tried wkhtmltopdf? I've experience when it was used for export of large table (about 3,000 PDF pages!) and it takes reasonable for this huge PDF result (several minutes).
This is a lot like `defer` in Go. I approve. :).
&gt;They were introduced in C# 2.0. So it has been a while. I just checked various specs, and it seems C# 1.0 already had them.
I'm so happy I mostly missed the .NET 1.x days.
Either just set it to a random string, to the email, or don't use the pre-provided `IdentityUser` and create your own one.
Guys. I’m an idiot. I was writing Console.WriteLine(myDoubleVar); rather than the int. This is only my third week in the class, if that’s not obvious enough. Thank you so much for your feedback. 
I was! Rather than printing myIntVar, I was printing myDoubleVar. Thank you so much for your help and making me realize what I was doing wrong, it’s greatly appreciated!!
I can reassure you that after nearly 2 decades programming, I still make that mistake occasionally. Once you get more confidence with what you expect to happen, it becomes pretty fast to debug. 
"doesn't seem to do xyz" is not an adequate error description. What's your test input? What's the expected result? What is the actual result? Come on, show more effort when asking for help.
simd compares with net core 3, 128 bits at a time
Braces are good in some places, but artificial and unnatural in the others. And this whole thing is very subjective too. Giving people more options to use the features they feel comfortable writing and reading is definitely a good thing.
If the object was being returned or passed in as a parameter, don't dispose it automatically. What would this not handle?
First of all, there is a lot of detail missing. What's your project? WPF, WinForms, WebForms? What exactly do you want? Just to send an email after a new item was added?
I’d recommend you to use one of the highlighters. They do exactly what you want and include it in the returned response. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html
So it's essentially a "I'll be using this until the end of this method, then I'd like you to dispose of it" instruction? I quite like that. Although it begs the question of why we even need the using declaration at all at this stage: why not just do this automatically for local variables at the end of their scope, when they implement IDisposable, and let us forget about it entirely? We'd still have an option to throw in an old-school `using {}` block if we want more control over the situation, and I can't think of a single scenario where I wouldn't want to dispose of a local variable unless it's either been passed in as a parameter, or is being returned.... in which case it wouldn't be included in the "local variables" thing.
And presumably the disposable variable would, at a higher level, be disposed of at the end of scope anyway?
Outside the scope of the variable? When? The variable doesn't exist, it's not like you can access it even if you want to. The only time I can see that you'd want it to survive outside of the direct scope in question is when it's either an `out` variable, or is being returned... in which case it would not be treated as a local variable, because it is explicitly being passed up the hierarchy. "Dispose objects at the end of their scope, unless they are returned/passed up to a higher scope" would seem the obvious (and intuitive) solution.
Pretty cool stuff. I hope there will be a way to mark a ref struct as being implicitly "using" so it will work as a C++ RAII container. For resources that must be released when the variable's lifetime ends this will make things so much easier.
&gt; and keeping the relevant resource alive for much longer than it needs to be How much work are your individual methods doing for this to be a problem? Almost any time I've ever used a disposable object, it's in a small "piece of work" method (get something from a database, write to a file etc), and therefore will be disposed of almost instantly when that piece of work is done. Sure, it could allow a few people, when not paying attention, to write a method where the resource is held too long.... but frankly, those people probably aren't using `using` blocks correctly already, so this would still be helpful.
&gt; why not just do this automatically for local variables at the end of their scope, when they implement IDisposable, and let us forget about it entirely? Mainly because factory methods exist, even for IDisposables.
Dunno about *ugly*, but it is getting to be a pretty large language, which has tradeoffs.
Bleep bloop, I am a bot. I like turtles and am here to collect some metrics. I will only comment once in every sub, so do not be worried about me spamming your precious subreddit! Goodbye, and have a nice day.
Scroll down a little bit, I've already answered this question.
What about `Span`? I have not yet had the chance to check what it does exclusively, mainly because netstandard doesn't have it yet, but do you think it can speed things up?
(Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.) Using forces disposal even if the GC reference count is &gt; 0. This is useful behavior at times, but definitely not universally or even predictably (for a compiler) desirable.
I’d do: var result = Task.Run( () =&gt; ReallyTimeConsuming() ); return result; Also make sure the wrapper method uses the async keyword. 
I sure hope so. I really love this class so far, but there are just so many intricacies to C#, it becomes easy to get bogged down and overlook the simplest things. 
I wanted 5, but turns out I was printing the wrong variable 🙈
but there would be now no difference if i use ReallyTimeConsumingFunction or ReallyTimeConsumingFunctionAsync since both will block the program until the function is done
This made me think of this discussion: https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/66
Assuming you mean https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/alk7sb/c_8_using_declarations/efew6qp/ I can see the argument, but that seems like a situation where you'd be aware of the difference and would "override" the default behavior with your own using block. There will always, with any syntax, be edge cases and niche scenarios where the developer wants to take more control - but in such a scenario, the developer presumably understands what they're doing and how it is different to the norm, so they can implement it slightly differently. As long as the option to throw your own using block around something, I don't see the problem. Similar to how you could potentially throw your own `try...catch...finally` around your code, if the current `using {}` syntax doesn't work for your scenario.
For the oddball cases, it seems more logical to have a keyword for those instead... But if it shouldn't be disposed, why is it Disposable anyway? It seems strange to implement an interface to dispose something, when you don't want it to be disposed... you wouldn't implement ISinkable for your Cruise Liner.
Right, I believe so. You actually probably know more about this than I do. My understanding is that to leverage async you need to have parallel processing somewhere earlier in the stack. Otherwise all it does is prevent the UI from freezing.
I've used it fairly recently for a .NET 4.6.1 service. If you can distill your code down to an example of just the basics of what you're trying to do it would help me and others.
You could always split your string using "&lt;em&gt;" as separator, then use the method on everything but the string containing '&lt;em&gt;', finally put them togheter with a loop. It's not the most efficient wait, you could probably speed it up with a StringBuilder - but it'll get you what you wanted and you can improve from that.
There isn't much to optimize in this code with the current context. Maybe, if you call this code multiple times with the same argument, you could cache the result?
That is a highly biased sample. It doesn’t tell you how many people quit because the learning curve was too steep. I wouldn’t say that it’s impossible, but you would get a very different answer in a more general population like /r/programming, and not because the average programmer isn’t interested in writing games... 
Ok here you go, this is probably the legit fastest way, some benchmarks: Using Linq, then using LinqFaster, then using Parallel LinqFaster, then using SIMD LinqFaster then using Parallel SIMD LinqFaster. SIMD Linqfaster will compare 128 bits at a time on cpus with SSE2 and 256 bits on cpus with AVX2 (and maybe 512 on avx 512? not sure if system.numerics does that) LinqFaster is a library I made, so you could use the SIMD version like so: `var same = myArray1.SequenceEqualS(myArray);` I just added SequenceEqual this morning when I saw your question, so you will need the code from github: https://github.com/jackmott/LinqFaster I haven't updated the nuget package yet. Method | TEST_SIZE | Mean | Error | StdDev | Gen 0/1k Op | Gen 1/1k Op | Gen 2/1k Op | Allocated Memory/Op | ---------------- |---------- |------------:|----------:|---------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|--------------------:| SequenceEqual | 1000000 | 14,064.5 us | 63.918 us | 56.66 us | - | - | - | - | SequenceEqualF | 1000000 | 2,286.8 us | 17.468 us | 16.34 us | - | - | - | - | SequenceEqualP | 1000000 | 722.5 us | 16.576 us | 17.02 us | 0.9766 | - | - | 4368 B | SequenceEqualS | 1000000 | 341.7 us | 6.754 us | 10.31 us | - | - | - | - | SequenceEqualSP | 1000000 | 269.9 us | 5.369 us | 13.76 us | 0.4883 | - | - | 3712 B |
ah this is really interesting. Iam gonna remove the async method because as it was said: users can write their own implementation for offloading. Thank you for posting this
&gt; what scenario is there where you actually want the resource to remain open HttpClient is the one that stands out. Which is to say, I wasn't thinking of weird hypotheticals where you implement `IDisposable` but never actually want it called. I was thinking of a specific, concrete example where Microsoft has already provided a class that implements the interface and best practice is to basically never `Dispose()` it. Which is gross and dumb and it's still the world we live in and kinda need to accommodate ourselves to.
If you aren't disposing your HttpClient, then you wouldn't be holding the instance in a local scope and it wouldn't be affected by this suggestion, unless I'm missing something?
Could be--I have mostly not had to deal with it. Wouldn't be the first time I had the wrong idea about something.
Will do. Cheers. 
Hmm. This is cool, but the idea of having "magic methods" - methods that have a special behavior because of what they're named - doesn't sit well with me.
There are a bunch of Libraries that do this well and in various ways, you could leverage one of them or just read the code to draw inspiration: [https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) [https://github.com/bilal-fazlani/CommandDotNet](https://github.com/bilal-fazlani/CommandDotNet)
They don't have special behaviour. They are just pattern recognised at compile time to be used in `using/foreach/fixed` blocks because that is the only possible way for them to be implemented. It is not possible to have `ref struct`s implement interfaces
They don't have a special behavior because of what they are named. They are still regular methods. Think of them as implementing an implicit interface. And it has always been the case since at least C# 5, not really something new. The compiler recognizes a set of methods to avoid having to pay the cost of boxing or casting to an interface.
It's wrong to think of it as "disposing memory". You are mostly disposing database connections and file handles. 
Hiding away implementation details can/will lead to hard to troubleshoot bugs. Maybe this example will help illustrate the point. HttpClient is a disposable class, but it is highly recommended to use this as a singleton object instead of disposing and creating new instances of it. You could initialize a new HttpClient object in your IoC Container to inject it throughout your app. If the compiler automatically included the using statement during this startup step it would not only break the app, it would confuse the developer because nothing looks inherently wrong.
C# has a long history of using magic methods, such as in foreach, collection initialisers and awaitables. This stackexchange has a bit of history of it. https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/253223/why-were-magic-methods-implemented-in-c 
&gt; since both will block the program until the function is done `await` operator does not block. It will return control to the caller until the Task finishes, at which point the called method will be resumed.
maybe i used the wrong words to describe it using this: var obj1 = ReallyTimeConsumingFunction(); Print(obj1); or this: var obj2 = ReallyTimeConsumingFunctionAsync(); Print(obj2); would make no difference since the print will only execute once the functions are done. If both functions run on the UI thread, will the ui freeze in the second call or not? 
`Span&lt;T&gt;` only exists in Core. It hasn't been added to Framework yet.
This keeps being repeated but it's not true. I use Span&lt;T&gt; in my full .Net 4.7 app and it's great. Just reference the System.Memory Nuget package. The .net core runtime has optimizations to make Span even better on core, but the "it only exists in core" line is just wrong.
Right, but it’s still an instance of duck typing. Behavior you can’t discover by looking at the declaration of the struct at a glance. This also exists for foreach and await. 
So I haven't yet made the jump from v2-&gt;v3 and it does seem like they've made some big changes in particular it seems they prefer task based return on an IJob and the GetScheduler of the StdSchedulerFactory is now awaitable. I seem to have modified your example a bit to get something working: `static void Main(string[] args)` `{` `try` `{` `// construct a scheduler factory` `ISchedulerFactory schedFact = new StdSchedulerFactory();` `// get a scheduler` `IScheduler sched = schedFact.GetScheduler().Result;` `sched.Start();` `IJobDetail job = JobBuilder.Create&lt;LoggingJob&gt;()` `.WithIdentity("myJob", "group1")` `.Build();` `ITrigger trigger = TriggerBuilder.Create()` `.StartNow().WithDailyTimeIntervalSchedule(x =&gt; x.OnEveryDay().WithIntervalInSeconds(5))` `.Build();` `sched.ScheduleJob(job, trigger);` `}` `catch (ArgumentException e)` `{` `Console.WriteLine(e);` `}` `Console.ReadKey();` `}` `public class LoggingJob : IJob` `{` `Task IJob.Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)` `{` `Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString());` `return Task.CompletedTask;` `}` `}`
I was going to mention you can use System.Memory but that's just pointless noise with no return, besides the ability to say "lol I'm using Span&lt;T&gt; in framework!" You get _none_ of the benefits of using `Span&lt;T&gt;` over `T[]` https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/issues/2581 &gt;&gt;&gt; The short answer is, yes. You can reference the System.Memory package (which was shipped as part of the .NET Core 2.1 release) and get access to Span/Memory along with things like Utf8Parser/etc. What you don't get, though, is all the other APIs that were added to .NET Core that accept and use span across the platform (things like span-based overloads on stream, since these are .NET Core specific). For a more detailed list of APIs that were span-enabled, see [dotnet/corefx#21281](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/21281)
&gt; They don’t have a special behavior because of what they are named. Well, yes they have. Via their name they get special treatment in using statements. &gt; And it has always been the case since at least C# 5, not really something new. It’s really only done for foreach and await. Foreach was done before generics, for performance. Await is also done for performance. Essentially, these things are done because .NET interfaces are too dynamic to be optimized efficiently. 
That's because the IJob Execute method is async. You need to define it as this: &amp;#x200B; public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
Your second example will not work and will return immediately. 
The code is being called with different values, it is BigInteger arithmetic class kind of thing. For instance `SubtractMod` calls it up to 4 times.
Hi. I did try that earlier, but then I then got a whole host of other errors. Cheers though.
Ah! That works! Thank you.
Well, that's how it works. Most likely you are not familiar with await/async.
What's the alternative? There isn't on
In this particular case there isn’t an easy way to implement it differently, due to limitations of interfaces in .NET. The alternative is of course not to add the feature. 
In which case you break `Span&lt;T&gt;`
You don’t break Span&lt;T&gt; by not being able to use using statements with it. 
No, but you do by removing duck typed `fixed` statements. And make it unimaginably more annoying by removing duck typed `foreach`
It's probably safe to say that it will never be fully implemented in .NET Framework. Anything that requires a CLR change will simply not happen.
&gt;This keeps being repeated but it's not true. It is absolutely true, it has not been added to the .NET Framework, but as you said it has been made available as a separate package. He did not say that you can't use it in an application targeting the .NET Framework.
You are ignoring the massive benefits of using Span (even in full .net) to do things like conversions from primitive types to their byte representation and vice versa without heap allocations: Replacing code like BitConverter.GetBytes with the new versions that use Span and don't allocate is awesome, especially if your code is sensitive to GC pauses and you are trying to eliminate heap allocations.
Thanks for the link, that was an interesting read.
He said it "only exists in core" which gives the false impression you can't use it if you are not on core.
No. While most list-like objects implement `IList&lt;T&gt;` and `IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;`, `Span&lt;T&gt;` does not. This means that there is no way to write a function that accepts both `Span&lt;T&gt;` and another list type. Why is it different? &gt; Ref struct types have a number of restrictions to ensure that they cannot be promoted to the managed heap, including that they can't be boxed, they can't be assigned to variables of type Object, dynamic or to any interface type, they can't be fields in a reference type, and they can't be used across await and yield boundaries. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1?view=netcore-2.2 Essentially the extra performance you get comes at the cost of losing functionality.
Duck typed foreach go (all the) way back and weren’t created for ref struct or anything like that. I’d argue that they can be harmful when considered together with the ever so loved LINQ. Since the latter is purely interface based, foreach and Select don’t always invoke the same iteration, to probably most people’s surprise. This can be a problem with certain legacy (pre-generic) collections. Sure, maybe it’s convenient for Span now, but if I had the choice between a language with stronger and more flexible interfaces and this mostly interfaces but some duck typing, I’d pick the former. 
I'm going through the code, that is a cool library, I found a couple of cool ideas I never knew about in there so thanks for sharing it.
I am, but it started erroring about not implementing something else. I allowed the "fix" and then it REALLY started going wrong, so I put it back to void, and started to make changes back up in the calling sub, and then got frustrated and came here :P
I consider your `ReallyTimeConsumingFunctionAsync` to be misleading. It isn't really async "all the way down", which is what I expect from async methods. If the caller wants to call your `ReallyTimeConsumingFunction` asynchronously, let the caller wrap it in an `await Task.Run(() =&gt; ReallyTimeConsumingFunction())`. The amount of time consumed by a method should typically have no impact on whether that method is made async or not. If the method has any I/O-bound work (file I/O, network calls, database calls, etc.), then it ought to also be made async (especially if the I/O-bound work is done using async methods). Otherwise, it should probably not be made async.
&gt; Span&lt;T&gt; only exists in Core. It hasn't been added to Framework yet you can use Span&lt;T&gt; in framework with the nuget package System.Memory
don't make something fake async if you do really need to (because say you need to give a Task&lt;T&gt; to something), you can do Task.FromResult&lt;T&gt;(T result)
So it turns out you *can* do this, as there is an implicit conversion operator for turning arrays into spans, the reason it wasn't working for me is due to generics making the type inference not work. So you can do `foo&lt;T&gt; (Span&lt;T&gt; span)` but to call it with an array you have to be explicit about the T: `foo&lt;int&gt;(intarray)` you can't cal it like this: `foo(intArray)` 
It isn't often useful on framework, as it is slow. But it can be nice for backwards compatibility at least. 
Interesting. 
Let's generalize this: Bar DoSomething() { var foo = new Foo(); return new Bar(foo); } Should you dispose `foo`? Well that depends on whether `Bar` needs to keep a reference to the open `foo` or just needs it temporarily. (e.g. something that wraps a stream vs reads from a stream.) 
&gt; Outside the scope of the variable? When? A good example is the way a stream wraps other streams: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/alk7sb/c_8_using_declarations/#efev7bw
He may be confusing it with VB. I think it didn't get the `using` statement until VB 8 in .NET 2.0
Indeed.
Make the program async all the day. Use await if you need to wait for the result.
Thanks for this! I did a different workshop as work sent me but would've loved to have done the Blazor one! Will check it out.
pssst. here's something from tomorrow's news that may interest you https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/02/csharp-defer
At which point the reference is being passed out of the scope, and wouldn't be disposed? To be clear, the suggestion being made is that items are automatically disposed at the end of scope **when not being passed out of the current scope**. If they are being returned (either directly, or as a child of the object being returned) or otherwise pass out of the scope (variable defined in a higher scope, out parameter etc), then they would not be disposed until the end of that scope.
But why do I need to introduce a new scope in the first place? The vast majority of the time I find myself using this pattern: return something from the database } //end of doubly nested using block (e.g. DbDataReader) } //end of nested using block (e.g. DbCommand) } //end of using block (e.g. DBConnection) } //end of function 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But if it shouldn't be disposed, why is it even implementing IDisposable anyway? 1. Bad design (e.g. HttpClient) 2. Self-disposing under certain circumstances (e.g. timers)
&gt; or as a child of the object being returned) The compiler does not have that information. 
If "using System.Drawing" gives you the red squiggles, you probably need to Right-click on the project references, and add it first.
I love this new syntax. As a game developer, it's really important to minimize the number of GCs that happen during gameplay, which means pooling and reusing short-lived objects such as collections that are only needed during the lifetime of a method call. To that end, I've created a number of "temporary" collection classes like `TempList`, `TempDictionary`, and `TempHashSet` that are subclasses of the System.Collections.Generic classes but handle allocating themselves from a pool and using Dispose() to release themselves back into the pool. Currently, I use these collections like this: using(var list = TempList&lt;int&gt;.Alloc()) { DoSomethingWithList(list); DoSomethingElseWithList(list); FinishDoingStuffWithList(list); } Which works great but is a bit verbose, causes extra indentation, and forces a scope where I don't necessarily want one. But with the new "using declarations" in C# 8, I can now do this: using var list = TempList&lt;int&gt;.Alloc(); DoSomethingWithList(list); DoSomethingElseWithList(list); FinishDoingStuffWithList(list); Which is less verbose, has no extra indentation, no unwanted scope block, and feels more natural and is closer to how one would create and use a non-temporary List&lt;T&gt;.
but what alternative could there be?
Do you have an easy method of rendering this data in HTML? I mentioned WkhtmlToPDF in another reply, and it really is an excellent tool. We just turned off our SSRS instance because the only thing it was being used for for PDF report generation, in favour of a web server running WkhtmlToPDF, we send it a page to render, it returns a PDF. A round trip is like 1 second. You could set up a similar app whereby you send it your serialized data, it builds your html, pipes it through wkhtmlToPdf, and returns the output.
Well, it’s up to imagination really, if the runtime isn’t supposed to stay compatible anyway. One way is to allow interfaces but disallow boxing. You can still call interface methods without boxing, on value types, but it needs to be done by generic, constrained, methods. This be expanded. Every design has tradeoffs. 
No you can't. `interfaces` are reference types and cannot be used on value types without boxing
I said if changing the runtime is allowed (and it certainly is, to some extent). Interfaces are not really reference types, or even types at all. The following method, when called with a *value type* which implements `IFoo` which contains the method `void Foo()`, will not cause boxing: void Method&lt;T&gt;(T x) where T: IFoo { x.Foo() // x will not be boxed here. } This is possible due to a prefix to the callvirt IL instruction called “constrained”, which is used for generic methods like that. Calling `Method(x)` doesn’t box. This is possible because the compiler knows the concrete type at compile time, so it has limits. But it could be used more, for example for ref structs.
But ref structs cannot be used as generics currently
“if changing the runtime is allowed”. Also, the constrained prefix could be used in other situations than generic methods (it just currently isn’t).
Firstly, it's a looot of effort for something so minor (ref struct interfaces) Secondly, it's even more irrelevant just because you dislike the fact the compiler has minor duck typing in certain circumstances
Spring boot is a lot more than just DI and mapping from DTO to domain objects and viceversa. You can get that with older Spring techs for a lower runtime and development cost. Spring boot is about integrating many different technologies easily. By controlling your dependencies only you can control what servlet container you use, what relational database, what object-relational mapping framework, which of the many spring boot integrations you want to include or not, and many more aspects. I haven't touched anything .Net in years, but I'd be surprised if Microsoft supported hundreds of different relational databases, nosql stores, object-relational mappers, web servers, transaction managers, connection pools, message brokers and so on. For one, there's nothing like the JSR system in the .Net world, which would allow for interchangeable implementations.
The extension method is declared in a type. That type is in a namespace. Just fully declare the types name and call the method. For example: namespace MyNamespace { public static class MyExtensions { public static void MyExtenstion(this object o) {} } } // Call: myObject.MyExtension(); MyNamespace.MyExtensions.MyExtension(myObject);
The issue with that is the quality on receipt paper is bad, and to do that costs money for a free project :(. Do you know of a free pdf library that you can print with?
I’m sorry, am I not allowed to discuss a feature? So after like 5 comments you tell me it’s irrelevant what I think? Then why reply in the first place? This is a C# forum, I am discussing C# design. I disagree that it’s just “minor duck typing”. Like I said, duck typing has drawbacks as well.
Replace &lt;em&gt; with something unique, i.e. $$em$$ and then strip the rest, then replace &lt;em&gt; back!
It doesn't really have drawbacks
Are you using .net standard or .net core? If im right they dont support System.Drawing. Try .net framework
async is a zombie virus, once you put it in your code it's everywhere but it's not a bad thing, just very spread-y
You might be right, but I would look at .NET core. It changed the game in a lot of ways.
&gt;New to C#. Sorry if this is stupid. Please give more information. What does your code look like? What project type is this? I'm guessing xchaosmods is right and you created a .NET Standard or Core project.
You can use third-party libraries to achieve your task. You can use [PDFSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1). It is open source and free and easy to use. You can use it to split a PDF based content. If you have not any problem to go for commercial you can use [UltimatePDF](https://www.componentpro.com/products/pdf) for .Net. It is very great and highly reliable commercial library. you can easily achieve your goal by using it. 
I think you should try [ItextSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/iTextSharp/)and [UltimatePDF](https://www.componentpro.com/products/pdf). by using it you can easily show your table in PDF. By using these mention libraries you can easily print your screen in pdf not only table you can also generate complex data and content on pdf. // Example Description: Shows how to create a simple grid using [System.Data](https://System.Data); using ComponentPro.Pdf; using [ComponentPro.Pdf.Graphics](https://ComponentPro.Pdf.Graphics); using ComponentPro.Pdf.Grid; &amp;#x200B; ... &amp;#x200B; // Create a new PDF document.

Consider how Drop is implemented for types in Rust. An interface implementation prevents magic name issues.
This, and it's something that really trips up those who are new to .Net. There's a ton of stuff out there with instructions on how to do things with System.Drawing, and it all seems generic and useful. Then later, you find out it's tied down to its implementation details with GDI/GDI+. It's really a shame that they didn't make System.Drawing a set of interfaces and base classes, then make a System.Drawing.GDI (or .GDIPlus) to implement it for Windows. That would have allowed other implementations to use generic-ish things like Color and Image in a portable way. I guess I can dream, right?
In my opinion move form word to pdf is not so easy. I assume fro your question you are facing problem and not find an easy solution to your problem. I suggest you to use third-party libraries. I suggest you to use [UltimatePDF](https://www.componentpro.com/products/pdf) for .Net. It is commercial and paid but it would be affordable for you. You can use it to solve your problem. In this you can easily save your word file to pdf or create new pdf and manipulate it. it is highly reliable and easy to use.
That's even more like defer in Go :)
That's even more like defer in Go :)
You can always use Entity Framework.
Span won't help here.
by the way it will be faster to iterate from 0 to &lt; arr.Length because .NET will do array bounds elimination in that case, and not when you count down (unless that changed in recent JITs, even if it did, counting backwards isn't an advantage like it was ~20 years ago on some hardware/c compiler combos)
you can make it ~4 to ~16 times faster depending on CPU 
.Net Framework is the full thing. .Net Core is a cut down version of .Net framework for portability to other platforms. .Net Standard is an even further cut down version and is even more portable than .Net Core. In general: If you're not sure, use .Net Framework. If you need portability, use .Net Core. I have no idea where you would use .Net Standard but it's there if you need it.
I mentioned one for foreach. We had that cause a bug in our code at work. The programmer was experienced, but didn’t know that foreach has this particular behavior. Most people don’t, I think. Granted, it takes a somewhat uncommon scenario to see a problem. But I’ve thought that many times, and our codebase at work is large enough that such things always end up showing somewhere :p.
Unless you implement only the non generic IEnumerable you can't have that bug anymore
If Dapper can't handle something that common, you should use NHibernate or Entity Framework.
I'm not able to stick in a full explanation and inevitably I will miss something but in short (and no offered meant) this assumption is wrong. Async is about Asynchronous coding and there is a difference between asynchronous and concurrent. It's really worth reading up on more as it can really change how you look at things 
&gt; I have no idea where you would use .Net Standard but it's there if you need it. If you write libraries that you want to use from different runtimes (.NET, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, Unity, UWP).
Ah yes :) thank you
too late for that now
'using' forces the call to the Dispose method on the object...nothing more. It can very much still be in memory afterwards 
It’s definitely on my list! I give it an attempt here and there but it’s tough to find realistic examples that aren’t daunting
That is true. I'd reccomend Jon Skeets coding blog (give it a Google it will be easy to find). He really knows his stuff and explains it in a great manner 
Also if your a book person, I liked this book. It's short and sweet http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026532.do
Thank
you!
Seems like decent syntactic sugar for short methods
If you cannot be async all the way down then have a look at [AsyncHelper](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/blob/e0ded5d8702f389aa1f5947d3446f16aec845287/src/Abp/Threading/AsyncHelper.cs) which will allow you to run an Async method in a syncronous way using RunSync()
Thats not how it works, classes are passed by reference. Only primitives like int are passed by value. If AccountTransaction was a struct I think it would work that way but its not really a reasonable way to do it. Call new and make a new object, its easier for people to read.
Thanks! Is there an example or documentation I can read about for this use case specifically?
As probably said before, instances of classes are references and are passed that way. The code above creates: * one instance of the class * you add that instance reference to the list * you change the properties * you add the same instance reference to the list The list now has two entries referring to the SAME instance, when you changed the properties before the second "Add", you essentially changed to all references to that class (including the one reference in the list already). To solve that, you must create a NEW instance of the class every time. (Other people may mention value types - these are things like structs and primitives, like int or DateTIme, for example - classes are reference types tho)
It's not clear whether ownership has been passed or or not, and this is a very simple example.
If I had to read all my homework on a 90* angle it would be both confusing and painful to my neck. Your professor is also terribad at naming methods, not that it would not work, just roll with it and do your best.
This is a past paper question my tecchdr didn’t make this an unsure do I use arrays or what?
In general you won't get homework help on these subs, you'll need to talk to someone else in your class, consult your notes or use a specific homework help sub. 
You can simplify a bit with a LINQ Method and trimming some excess (assuming your box is a generic collection under the covers) var b = new Box { BoxId = input.First().BoxId } b.AddRange(intput.Select(i =&gt; new BoxContents { Item = i.Item };
If you want to load the data eagerly, you might want to check “recursive common table expressions”. 
For cryin out loud, even if had put the correct response how would he read that? Don't let that slop carry into your code or you'll never get anything to compile. 
Sorry poor picture 
SecretAttribute
As other said, almost everything (except primitives and structs) get passed by reference - basically by their memory address/pointer (not exactly, but you can think about it this way). Passing a variable doesn't actually create a copy of it, just pass a note, saying "hey, your object is here". Your list only stores this reference, which is useful as the system doesn't have to copy huge amount of data when you process a list (imagine otherwise - scrolling through a list could possibly create and move gigabytes of data in the memory). This is an extremely important part of the C#, so it is a great thing to experiment with!
A valid correction, but if anything it reinforces my point.
The next round starts tomorrow. Here's a sneak peek: https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/02/csharp-defer
 class AccountTransaction { AccountTransaction(int amt, string payorid, Date date ) { Amount = amt; PayorID = payorid; TransactionDate = date; } int Amount; string PayorID; Date TransactionDate; } response.Body.AccountStatement.Transactions.Add( new AccountTransaction(100000, "101", "2019/01/30 23:30:00";)); response.Body.AccountStatement.Transactions.Add( new AccountTransaction(200000, "666", "2019/01/29 07:24:24")); Use constructors for simpler code.
You can't even read the full directions.
I wish async constructors existed. If a class implements an async cleanup method, it makes sense to also offer an async construction method. And yes, there are ways around it that IMO are messy and prone to error (the most common pattern is an "InitializeAsync()" method called after construction).
Make the constructor private and expose an async factory method. 
Here's an example of why this is impossible: IDisposable someDisposable = new SomeDisposable(); SomeMethod(someDisposable); return; Did `SomeMethod` store the reference or not?
Or you can run it as Foo(arr.AsSpan());
If I am understanding this correctly they want you to write a method that will do the following: 1.) Prompt the user to enter in a number 2.) Check if entered in thing is a number 3.) Check if entered number is within min and max 4.) Handle errors Its fairly straight forward you use `console.readline` to read the input and then convert to a number and then check with if statements if inside the range. You can use `TryParse` to verify input is correct and conver to number. If tryparse or range if checks return false use `console.writeline` to output an error messages. A good final message of value accepted would be good too. There might be more to it but part of the instructions are cut off. I am assuming data declaration just means `int input = int.TryParse(Console.Readline());` where the `int input` is the data declaration. Never seen it put that way but thats what I would think. Now that method name is Horrible `public static enter_No_Of_Items` seriously so many things wrong. 1.) Shouldn't use underscores 2.) First word should note be lower case 3.) Don't use no as short hand for Number use Num 4.) Also Enter verb is confusing I would of perferred Prompt which they used below 5.) This should not be a public method definitely should be internal. Too many people using public methods for everything. A better method would be `internal static PromptNumOfItems()`
What's a compelling example for async construction? Every example I've seen is better served by an async factory method so construction remains just assign some values.
I've used [HtmlSanitizer](https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer) before and it can definitely be configured to achieve this.
Use a ValueTuple instead of a class.

The compiler knows if there’s a reference to an object somewhere - that’s how GC works.
Switch ORMs. You’ll never look back. Dapper is a micro ORM, hence all its limitations. Look into EF + AutoMapper. 
Yep there's a [bunch](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/01/async-oop-2-constructors.html) of them all trying to handle something that could be easily addressed with a simple async constructor. And yes, I realize that constructors doing "work" in general are a bad idea, but exceptions always apply.
Agreed - Constructors are meant for object initialization, not for long running tasks. 
How large are the arrays? Are you comparing small arrays billions of times, or large arrays just a few? 
No, don't do that. Read these articles: [https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/10/taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage.html](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/10/taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage.html)
You need to give the method a name, and toss the return statement.
If you already have a database then no, not too late. You can literally generate the data model and context classes from the database.
What is a constructor? 1. A static function 2. That allocates memory 3. And optionally initializes values 4. Using a special syntax At the end of the day all we're gaining is #4. Is that worth a language change? 
Your method doesn't have a return, so you can just take out the return. Also, it needs a name. There's no reason to make `c` ref, since it isn't changing. internal static void Convert(int c, out int f) { f = c + 32; } And I would re-think using an out for this. It makes more sense to me to return the result.
Generally I agree with you, but because it's so fun to play devil's advocate: What does it mean to for an object to be "constructed"? There's arguably a minor break in OO design if an object, post-ctor, can't actually be used for anything until some other code is run. Also, there are examples like `FileStream` that do perform I/O in their ctor, so it's not unprecedented. I implemented async XLinq support in .NET Core a couple years ago and ran into an existing type that had a ctor doing I/O. To update it to async, I had ended up implementing a factory ctor -- but this brought out an inconsistency in its design so I wasn't to happy. I ultimately judged it would be better to make just the change I needed rather than altering a bunch of sync code as well, doubling the testing/review surface area. It's a choice I'm still a bit uncomfortable with. Having an async ctor would have made it a very easy choice.
FWIW that's also not the correct formula for celcius into fahrenheit ( c x 9/5) + 32 .
If you already have a database then no, not too late. You can literally generate the data model and context classes from the database. And the code you would have to write in Main would be: using(var context = new BoxContext()) { var boxes = context.Boxes.Include(box =&gt; box.Contents).ToList(); }
I'm reminded of DBConnection.Open. A lot of ink has been spilled over if it should have been merged into the constructor. 
As others have stated, this is due to AccountTransaction being a reference type. [Read the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/types) and/or look into some other tutorials on the matter, you probably won't understand it completely at first but if it's in the back of your mind it should eventually 'click' as you program more. Your code fails as you're: 1. Creating a new transaction 2. Setting the values in that transaction 3. adding **a reference** to the transaction in your list 4. Modifying the transaction 5. Adding **a reference to that same transaction** to your list As for your edit, when you use `transaction = new AccountTransaction();` transaction is now referencing a **new** AccountTransaction. Try and remove `transaction.PayorID = "666";` and you will see that PayorID is not "101" as your expecting but null instead! Some general advice is to use a more powerful IDE such as visual studio or jetbrains rider which lets you use a *debugger* and add *break points* to your code that pause the execution of your program and let you inspect the current state of what's running. I urge you to also read up on [Constructors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors) , if your code was `new transaction(10000, "666", "2019/01/29 07:24:24");` for example you have fewer lines of code and there's no way to accidentally make the same mistake, a win-win. There's a lot of us that try and avoid being able to set properties outside of constructors at all and it's precisely because it stops the kind of 'unexpected' behavior you've encountered, we instead aim to make our classes *immutable*, i.e. once we've created the object is strictly read only. 
You could use a similar argument against async iterators.
System.Resources.ResourceReader
I'm genuinely curious, what would you do in a constructor that requires an asyncronous operation? I've always tried to avoid doing anything in a constructor outside of setting class parameters. Seems if you were fetching something off the internet or connecting a socket or whatever you'd be better off writing an asyncronous method to handle it.
&gt; And I would re-think using an out for this. It makes more sense to me to return the result. This. The only reason you really need out parameters is when you need to return two different things. The various TryParse methods are a good example of this: * It has a `bool` return type for whether the parse was successful * It has an out parameter with the actual parse results if the return value was true.
\`catch (SocketException sex) // Tee hee\`
I think this was a homework assignment. But it would have been a better assignment if it contained a reasonable reason for using ref and out parameters.
I can't count the number of times I've felt slightly uncomfortable typing that line lol.
You might feel less uncomfortable if you omitted the "Tee hee" comment.
&gt; as Foo(arr.AsSpan()); Yeah, I am trying to update a library to be able to use span, and it would be no good to break all the old code for users of the libary. Also I've figured out span is a lot slower than an array unless you are on .net core. So I'm just gonna need to write the function twice :( 
It's not an argument, it is a question.
Use an interface, reference System.ComponentModel.Composition, and [enjoy the awesomeness that is MEF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/). I can provide a short example if needed.
Without reading any of the other comments, install the Microsoft compatibility pack. However, just ties your dot net core application to Windows service only.
Yes but then you're relying on GC to `Dispose()` during collection. It'd have to wait for the dispose to complete before continuing (delaying collection). This would also make finalizers largely redundant. It's just a whole rabbit hole of complexity that's largely unnecessary and probably not wanted, since you never know when the GC will actually collect anyway (not ideal for sockets or file handles). You could do an entirely separate lot of reference tracking every time an IDisposable hits the end of its scope, but that's a massive perf hit (and even then, if it is leaked... when do you dispose of it?)
Sure sometimes practicality beats purity but most often doing more than just assigning instance values in a ctor is just lazy devs being lazy. Ditto for any post init method that needs to be called for an object to be operational.
In that case, yes it is worth it, for the same reason async iterators is.
I would back up your comments here with only that Sharpdx is still actively supported where I believe Slim DX hasnt had an update in 3 years. Having said that, as c#/Sharpdx game dev, i've enjoyed working with Sharpdx and building my engine, but im just nuts. sample of game project in link -&gt; [https://www.facebook.com/InsaneSoftware.com.au/](https://www.facebook.com/InsaneSoftware.com.au/) &amp;#x200B;
These days you just return a tuple. The following is a perfectly valid code in C#: (int, int) Convert(int f) // tuple return type { //... return (farenheit, kelvin); }
I assume this is for a homework assignment because nobody would write a function like this. You don't need to change `c` so there's no point to make it `ref` and you'd typically just `return` the result instead of an `out` param. So, just put `//WTF would I do it like this; seems like a case of Product driving design if you ask me. Full marks. Alternatively static int ConvertToFarenheit(int tempInCelsius) { return tempInCelsius*9/5 + 32; } Although your input and return should be `double`s unless you only want whole numbers.
