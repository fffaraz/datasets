I wrote a quick UI for a utility application in C# Winforms the other day.
&gt;By that logic shouldnt we be skipping WPF and going straight to UWP? It streamlined a lot of stuff... Learn UWP. It is optimized over WPF.
I hit this issue one time when the computer didn't have a recent .net runtime installed.
No, because UWP can only run on W10, where WPF and winforms can do at a minimum XP, 7, and 10
Method names in a test class should explain what you are trying to test and what the expected result is. The test class name "UT_AL_01_DFS" is sub-optimal, a better class name would be "HasPathDFSTests". Because that's what it tests, the HasPathDFS() method. &gt; Below is code and a picture of the graph I am using to test if a graph has a path from one node to another using a DFS algorithm. That means, at minimum, I expect to see the following methods: - DFS_finds_path_from_a_to_b() - DFS_fails_to_find_path_from_a_to_b() You need to also consider the question of whether you really care what route the DFS took to get from A to B. If you care, then you're testing implementation. If all you care about is that you can get from A to B, then you're testing behavior and you don't need all the Assert calls. To elaborate further, you should be using multiple graphs to validate the DFS behavior. What should happen when the graph contains zero nodes? One node? Two nodes? A graph where the starting node is completely unconnected from the destination node? What other strange graphs can you throw at the DFS algorithm in addition to a graph that connects from A to B in N hops. Each of those graph oddities should have it's own test method and validate that you get the desired result. Which then serves as documentation for what you expect the method to do when faced with a particular set of inputs. 
It's everything winforms is and more. I'm a fucking noob so I can't tell you all about it but it's better
You should avoid multiple projects except for a few cases: - One of your projects creates a Nuget package for consumption by some other solution in your organization. - You have multiple products (web sites, console tools, etc.) being generated in the same solution. Then you might end up with a "Core" project to handle everything needed by all the various products. - Database migrations are good to have in their own project. But even that's not a hard and fast rule. - Tests definitely go in their own project. They don't need to be included in the final build. 
I'm fairly certain they've been there since the switch back from the experimental `project.json` back to `*.csproj`which happened with .NET Core 1.1 I believe. All 2.x versions definitely have it.
WinForms are just a UI, just like WPF, Asp.net MVC, WCF, Web API, and client\-rendered UIs like Angular and React. Interfaces typically don't have clean upgrade paths, which is a good strategic case for Multi\-tier architectures.
Back in my day we found VB1 on floppy when cleaning the house.
There is something to be said about knowing the proper command line arguments. You won't always have your IDE of choice if you move between computers. You can't help people generically if you don't know the command line.
Yep!
do i set to Rows\[i\] for both buttons ?
You are no longer taking about policy style permissions and even in your example of returning a 404 that’s pretty deep down the call stack to be initiating a 404 again why the endpoint is better 
I prefer one test class per test case, and a distinct test method per assertion.
Yes they do. And System.Windows .Forms.Integration.ElementHost is my favorite control when dealing with them. It hosts a WPF control.
One test for the happy path is very limited. What if you have logic like `if (price &gt; 100) deliveryCosts = 0m; else deliveryCosts = 3m;`? You’d need at least two tests. And that’s just a simple case. 
Since UWP is heavily based around XAML, it would be a piece of cake to go from WPF to UWP. Same cannot be said of Winforms to WPF since WPF introduces a lot of new concepts. Concepts you learn as you start playing with WPF. Styles, datatemplates, UI virtualization etc. WPF ATM can do more then UWP, and while it looks like UWP will be the way forward, it currently is not ready for full fledged desktop applications and is mostly focused on mobile devices. Windows is slowly fixing it by bring it closer to WPF, but it'll take some time. By the logic of your second point you might as well start in VB6 too, or assembly. But why not get a headstart in WPF (and by extension UWP)?
Yeah, actually I am a little better in hearing, reading English than writing,currently am immigrant so my mother language useless for me, except talking with some friends, even all my class mate which are all from various country we are all studying in English, When it's come to programming, always the straightforward resources and information are in English, and a video 10m long usually takes me 15 minute to understand it, I keep playing the video again,and using translator for some strange words, 
I won't agree with this! The real problem is purely technical: with semantically unrelated asserts like this, the testing framework will stop executing the test after the first failure. That way you loose information about the *other* assertions. As test framework authors are pretty aware of this problem, there should be an option by the framework to *combine* those asserts into one. NUnit offers an overloading of ``&amp;`` and methods like ``And()``. This way you can easily combine assertions. I use this often to check the different properties of an object. What makes the above example different is the fact, that there are not only multiple assertions but multiple *results*. For solving this problem frameworks offer some sort of parameterized test cases. So instead of calculating the different results in X asserts, the framework executes the tests X times, each with the data for one graph setup. This is far more readable btw. 
If Windows you might want to read about WPF.
+1 for learning "from different angles". There are so many teachers and good websites out there. So many free resources. Sometimes I watch 2-3 videos on one topic and read a few articles until it finally "clicks" for me. 
How wonderfully naive. I like it.
For repetitive assertions such as this you may want to explore Data-driven / Parameterized test capabilities provided by (most?) Test Frameworks. Example: [https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/TestCaseData](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/TestCaseData) This allows you to maintain a high granularity of test results without having to declare a huge number of methods.
I checked, delegation is enabled
Such as? You can totally use WPF like you use Winforms if that's your thing. But you'll at least have a DPI consistent UI.
That.
I don't get it, how is a Winforms app inherently faster to write than a WPF one?
I référence it as an assembly, my xamarin project has. Net standard as code sharing method. Should I do otherwise? 
I see what he meant by that; you can totally use it like Winforms, but that's not the expected way to do so in big applications (MVVM would be). So you have to learn how MVVM works, and how to use it in WPF. And if you use MVVM, you'll probably like to use a framework, so you don't "reinvent the wheel" for every project. So now you have a MVVM framework to learn. And let me tell you, I chose Catel, and it's HUMONGOUS. It's stellar, but huge. The learning curve is pretty steep.
You will have to pass a Collider class object with the method call. You will have to instantiate a Collider object, with the correct parameters, before sending it to the method.
While your post kinda breaks rule 4, I'm gonna be a bit helpful. It looks like you don't really understand the code you're writing, so I'm going to explain what the parts do. First, let's have some properly formatted code: namespace uzAI { public class TestScript : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject zombie; public int DamagePerSecond = 2; public float range = 100f; public float fireRate = 15f; public Camera fpsCam; private float nextTimeToFire = 0f; private void Update() { if (Input.GetButton("Fire1") &amp;&amp; Time.time &gt;= nextTimeToFire) { nextTimeToFire = Time.time + 1f / fireRate; Shoot(); } } void GiveDamage(uzAIZombieHealth Health) { Health.onDamage(DamagePerSecond); } void Shoot (Collider other) { RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(fpsCam.transform.position, fpsCam.transform.forward, out hit, range)) { if (other.tag == "uzAIZombie") { if (other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;() { GiveDamage(other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;().ZombieHealthStats); } } } } } } Your question is *"How do I call method `Shoot` if it has a parameter"*. The short answer is: you pass the parameter. Though it looks like with your code, the parameter isn't properly being used. So let's ask a better question: *"How can I shoot a zombie?"*. Let's see what you're trying to do in your original code: void Shoot (Collider other) { RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(fpsCam.transform.position, fpsCam.transform.forward, out hit, range)) { if (other.tag == "uzAIZombie") { if (other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;() { GiveDamage(other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;().ZombieHealthStats); } } } } Looks like you're raycasting, but not using the result, but instead using the parameter. A raycast is basically drawing a line from one in a certain direction, for a certain range. The raycast then returns all physics objects it hits. In other words, it shoots a ray and reports what it hits. Let's look at [the documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html). Looks like it returns a boolean which indicates whether it hits anything at all, and has an `out` parameter that returns the actual hit information. What we need is the object that the raycast hit, which is probably in that hit information object. So let's look at the [documentation of RaycastHit](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RaycastHit.html). Looks like it has a property `collider`, which holds the collider that was hit. Looks like it has some other handy properties that you may be able to use later for effects, `point` for the impact point, `normal` for the impact direction. But now we know where we can find the collider, so let's change the code to reflect that. void Shoot() { RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(fpsCam.transform.position, fpsCam.transform.forward, out hit, range)) { Collider other = hit.collider; if (other.tag == "uzAIZombie") { if (other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;() { GiveDamage(other.GetComponent&lt;uzAIZombieStateManager&gt;().ZombieHealthStats); } } } } I've removed the now unused parameter, so the call to it in `Update()` should work now. I've changed the raycast test so that the collider that the raycast found is used instead of the removed parameter. Hope this explains it a bit. Next time, for Unity specific questions, you may want to go to /r/Unity3D, and for programming questions, /r/LearnProgramming. Also be sure to read the subreddit rules to see what you can expect when you post something. Good luck with you project!
Hi, Topmost is not what you want. Topmost will make the window always stay on top of any window that has Topmost set to false. So if you have four windows, two with Topmost set to true and two with it set to false, the two with true will always be above the two with false. You can still bring any window in the same group (topmost is true or false being the two groups) in front of any other window in the same group. 
I found the box for a copy of VisualAge C++ for OS/2 recently which I paid for personally. If I remember correctly the IDE was written in Smalltalk and made Eclipse seem like a speed demon. I really liked OS/2 and make no apology. Until recently I had to maintain a project that only worked in .net 1.1 and management wouldn't consider porting it to 2.0 - it used a lot of custom controls that didn't render correctly in 2.0 so it stayed in 1.1, so I needed a VM running Windows 7 to run VS2003 on (even though it wasn't supported in Windows 7). Life is much better now.

They're making a comeback for .Net Core 3.0.
It's not bad, but I took exception (pun intended) to some of the justifications you use. &gt; First, it's about communicating intent. We mostly get a set of business requirements that we should fulfill. They tell us what to expect when implementing different use cases. If we go and add many checks for things that might, but should not, happen we lose the connection between our use cases and the code. It will be hard to tell the intent of the code, which in turn lead to assumptions and in the end decreased code quality. &gt; Second, if we add many checks we are coding workarounds as the real problem is that our account was hacked, not that we could not pay. By adding checks and abort instead of paying we are hiding that fact. This is partly correct. Organisations which keep the development team at arms length, treat them as an annoying distraction, almost always lose. These are the organisations who bitch about the product being late, requiring work arounds for "obvious" business cases and costing 10 times the original quote. You have not explained how the system recovers from the exception that you've thrown. This is one of the hardest parts of exception management. Second, instead of getting clarification on what the checks you should make are, you're throwing exceptions. It's push vs pull requirements gathering. The intent of the code is not clarified with exceptions. The whole point is they are exceptional events. If you're throwing an exception because you didn't clarify the behaviour under that condition then you're communicating nothing of value, simply deferring the need to ask the business what to do in that situation. Finally, your account being hacked is entirely separate to there not being sufficient funds in your account to pay for something. This is business specific, so hold on for the ride, but it will give you some insights I hope will help. Financial transactions cascade events, but at the PoS (Point of Sale, not the other one) you are dealing with a massive volume of transactions and you will not at this point care if the cardholder's account has been hacked. You just say "STAHP!". The cascading of events part is where those transactions that go through are passed to a different system as events and those events are monitored for incongruent behaviours. This is why your fraud alerts turn up at weird times*. The two are entirely unrelated. * So Google's spelling web service is telling me that "This is why your fraud alerts turn up at weird times." should be " This is why you're fraud alerts turn up at weird times.". I think they've been on the sauce. 
First of all, thank you for taking time to leave a comment. Appreciate it. &gt; This is partly correct. Organisations which keep the development team at arms length, treat them as an annoying distraction, almost always lose. These are the organisations who bitch about the product being late, requiring work arounds for "obvious" business cases and costing 10 times the original quote. From my experience, cluttering the code with if statements to avoid exceptions decreases the productivity as you do not solve why that method was called with incomplete/invalid arguments. That has nothing to do with exceptions or their purpose. It's a business decision to at all costs keep the code running. My statement might be wrong for those companies, but they are hardly all. &gt; You have not explained how the system recovers from the exception that you've thrown. This is one of the hardest parts of exception management. Second, instead of getting clarification on what the checks you should make are, you're throwing exceptions. It's push vs pull requirements gathering. At the beginning of the article, I said that I would explain the purpose of exceptions and not details. There is a link at the bottom for the rest of the exception articles. But I like to answer that anyway as it's a fair point. A system does not recover from exceptions. That is the point. The exception should abort the business transaction as it cannot be completed without side effects. You can log them or use an automated system to analyze them and create incidents/bug reports. &gt;The intent of the code is not clarified with exceptions. The whole point is they are exceptional events. If you're throwing an exception because you didn't clarify the behaviour under that condition then you're communicating nothing of value, simply deferring the need to ask the business what to do in that situation. I did not say that exceptions communicate intent. What I meant is that having a lot of if statements to try to mitigate errors \(like invalid or incomplete information\) makes it harder to understand what the current method expects and what it tries to do. Throwing an exception instead increases readability as it tells what was expected \(compared to having if statements\). &gt;Finally, your account being hacked is entirely separate to there not being sufficient funds in your account to pay for something. This is business specific, so hold on for the ride, but it will give you some insights I hope will help. I might have misinterpreted your comment. The whole point of my example was that there were two different business cases. One where funds might be limited and another unrelated case where there always should be enough funds. Can I clarify that in some way? &gt;Financial transactions cascade events, but at the PoS \(Point of Sale, not the other one\) you are dealing with a massive volume of transactions and you will not at this point care if the cardholder's account has been hacked. You just say "STAHP!". The cascading of events part is where those transactions that go through are passed to a different system as events and those events are monitored for incongruent behaviours. This is why your fraud alerts turn up at weird times\*. The two are entirely unrelated. Absolutely. But explaining that while trying to tell what exceptions are might confuse the readers. My scenarios are simplistic and fictional just to try to illustrate the difference. At least that was my intent ;\)
In this case (for this method since it only returns a boolean answer), each test should be focused on "given this graph's topology, does it return the correct answer when asked to find a path between two points". Then provide it enough different topologies that you are reasonably confident that it can handle any topology. Starting with simple cases (no nodes, one node, two nodes, two unconnected nodes, three nodes with various connection scenarios) makes it easier to diagnose problems when a test fails. Then you could also create a test using a modestly large topology and have it test getting from multiple starting points to multiple destination points. In xUnit this is where `[Theory]` comes into play where you can use `[InlineData('a', 'b')]` to tell the method to test that you can get from a to b. [Theory] [InlineData(1, 2)] [InlineData(3, 4)] public void Can_get_from_start_to_finish_in_test_graph( int startingNode, int endingNode ) { var graph = CreateModeratelyComplexTestGraph(); var answer = HasPathDFS(gr_int, startingNode, endingNode); Assert.True(answer); } In xUnit, theories are ways to ask multiple questions about the same system under test (SUT). It works out similar to your multiple asserts, except that the test harness will execute all variations of the theory -- even if one of them fails. Where folks run into trouble with multiple asserts is that the test usually stops checking things once the first Assert fails. That means you have zero information about whether the rest of the Assert lines would or would not have passed. Depending on what the additional Asserts are testing for, it can make it harder to figure why code is not passing the first failed Assert. OTOH, sometimes multiple asserts are good. For instance, there's no point in testing that a string contains a value if it is null, or empty. So by having the first two asserts say "the result must not be null" and "the result must not be empty", the third assert that actually checks for behavior will not fail because of the trivial null/empty case. TL;DR - multiple asserts are sometimes useful
Ok new tests. If I comment the impersonation, everything works fine. so strange 
I think people are just disagreeing with you on the definition of outdated. I would consider Winforms outdated in the same way I would consider VB6 outdated, but I wouldn't consider Winforms *deprecated.*..Microsoft *is* carrying support for Winforms forward to .NET Core 3.0 \(though it won't be cross platform\). \&gt; I'm not advocating that you write advanced UI applications in Winforms, but for the vast majority of things, it's incredibly productive. I would agree that its very productive...for small to medium sized projects. Once you get more than a certain number of developers working on a certain number of screens, things like composibility, advanced layouts, and easier merging become more important to productivity than the RAD editor of Winforms.
So, if you are mixing the old sdk and the new sdk, net framework w/ old xml csproj and core sdk w/ new xml csproj, you will need to manually reference/install the packages due to transient package references not being carried over in the old sdk. Someone at my workplace just did this which was causing some headaches. Visual studio build would carry over the dlls, but our msbuild build agents weren't.
I am writing extensions to ERP system on winforms right now. I only thank God that we at least got that .NET 4.0 update from vendor. Two updates before that it was 3.5 and 2.0.

This is a perfect case for what /u/shaddar says below [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/8jqh95/write_1_unit_test_for_1_assertion_for_1_result_or/dz283zz/) But for cases where you have multiple asserts for a single test case, it depends, but it's generally ok to assert more than one thing. For example, if you want to check that if I transfer cash from account A to account B, you want to assert that both A and B have the correct amount debited and credited. If you want to check that A and B credit/debits work for 30 cases, then see the link above. If you want to check that the credit/debit is ok, and then tack on a line or two to check if the overdraft protection kicks in, that's bad. It's two separate cases. The second case only works if the first case has specific data, so that's obscuring the outcome.
Don’t use Show. Use ShowDialog(); you really have want them to manipulate data on the previous screen while the new one is open? Or maybe that is your intention
Doesn't answer your question I'm afraid, but I highly suspect you should be returning `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` instead of `IEnumerable&lt;BaseInterface&gt;` anyway.
This. I always go back to the critiques of the missile command programming, how "dated" it is. Well the pentagon would update it, if the authors could *guarantee* it would be bugfree and reliable, something somewhat important in the case of nuclear launches. Don't sell me a pneumatic hammer with a compressor service package when granddad's old roofing hammer still does the job. Just watch yer thumbs, makes for careful tradesmen :-)
The problem is that interface covariance cannot work for value types for technical reasons. `T` could be a value type, so the compiler doesn't allow it. On the other hand, `SubInterface1` is a reference type (or boxed value types) so that is allowed. You can further constrain `T` to `class`, then the error should go away.
Legend! Thank you for that. I didn't know that was the case
No they don't. Go ahead with Python.
Doesn’t NLog already have an extension for Azure Table Storage logging (among others)?
Possibly. I don't have experience with NLog.
Wait what? Like, fully open sourced and everything?
That's two separate use cases: normal and free shipping.
It's a very common tactic for new devs. Since the window only disappears when debugging in VS it's better to just put a breakpoint on the closing `}` of your Main method.
This is the real result: D1.AutoCreateGraph_02_Directed_int(gr_int); Everything else is just looking at properties of `gr_int`. &gt; NUnit offers an overloading of &amp; and methods like And(). This way you can easily combine assertions. I use this often to check the different properties of an object. That's a start, but in my own testing framework you write using(var assert = new AssertionContext) From there it collects all of the results and reports them in one unit at the end. (Unless there is an exception, I haven't quite figured out how to catch multiple of those.)

It's literally impossible to have a 64 bit OS on a 32 bit machine lol, I was making a joke before. You could have a 32 bit OS on a 64 bit CPU, but not the other way around.
I feel the exact same way. With the addition of really missing the command line and the task file in VisualStudio whenever I work through that.
Plus win forms is a lot faster.
To be more specific, every reference type requires exactly the same amount of space. And in a generic context, any methods you call on them would use the same interface. (That interface being the class or interface named in the `where` clause.)
Write in the search box: Reformat And you'll see what a keyboard shortcut is written there.
classes are reference types, which are passed by pointer, to unmanaged code, so I'd have to change the C++ side to take an S**, which *would* work, except for the fact that it truncates the array to 1 element for some ungodly reason.
My best guess after some more trying and researching is that the marshaller doesn't know if it can pin the array (even though it should be able to) and copies it instead. Also heard some people that it can depend on what JITter is used, i.e. some scenarios may work differently between x86 / x64 / AnyCPU
That's ridiculous. You would dramatically increase the run time of the tests with all of the duplicate work and make it much harder to find related tests.
Here, it's quite trivial, have a look at this: https://dotnetfiddle.net/rWTjnC
Agreed, but I would call that an integration test not a unit test. 
I was doing some work earlier today in VS2017 CE and it worked for me too.
I bought this exact version, and was what spring-boarded my interests. I loved how they came with posters of the framework; threw the box ages ago, but kept the posters!
Sorry about that, I wasn't sure where to post. However, this helped me immensely and I really appreciate it! 
Ha! :D
Can confirm. Am 3 months in to a winforms project at work. *sigh*
I did end up doing that yes, but my curiosity was peaked
Did you install resharper and use their keyboard layout/keybindings? that is, if they still ask for that
Well worth the time to watch this
Think of it from the programs perspective. Console.Readline(); you're telling the console to read a line of input from the user. The result is the console accepts a string. Console.Writeline(string); your telling the console to write a string that you've provided.
Or just launch it via CTRL+F5 to launch your program in non-debug mode. Then you get the classic "Press any key to continue . . .` text thats like C++'s system("pause"); 
THANOS
You don't really need the appsettings.json or at least you can just override all the values from the appsettings from commandline when starting the service. Here is a good link on [configuration on ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.0&amp;tabs=basicconfiguration)
From memory (might be false!): you can do a MessageBox.Show. In your Form you can do things using the Idle event.
You can also write Console.Readkey() at the end. The same effect.
`Console.ReadLine()` will "wait for" (and capture) user input. The "Line"-part of the statement is very important, because it "stops" (capturing), when the user hits enter. The `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")` will write *Hello World*, followed by a [newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) to the console. It has *absolutely nothing to do* with `Console.ReadLine`, they are different statements, which do different things. One captures user input; and the other writes to the console. A console program will automatically exit (or terminate) when it hits "the end of your code". A very popular way to stop this, is by adding a `Console.ReadLine()` to the end of your code. This will force the program to *wait for the user to hit enter* before exiting. Here is a very simple dotnet fiddle showing how both `Console.WriteLine` and `Console.ReadLine` works: https://dotnetfiddle.net/tAJulh Another way to stop the program from exiting, is by using `Console.ReadKey()` to the end of your program. This method will just read (and capture) *one key*; so instead of waiting for the user to hit Enter, it will simply wait for the user to hit "any key", then terminate. Happy hacking! :)
The formatting screwed up so I can't get a line number. Put it in a pastebin?

The idea was to save all of this in a file .txt as you could see, so that the person can save the game and then play again without losing everything, and I did this at school because our teacher asked us to do it, so that we could learn in case we ever need it, so, that's the only way I know hoe to do it
Some of these would be cool. I especially like the consistent constructors and traits-- both of which I desire to have a lot. Another thing I really, really, really wish C# had: Higher-kinded types. I find myself needing it at least once a week and having to hack around it. 
This line: "for (int i = 0; i &lt; HeroSheet.Length; i++)" You might want "for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; i++)" or something similar, with Herosheet.length you are using the size of the text file as in index into your hero stuff, probably not what you want.
Wow. I wasn't familiar with higher-kinded types. Those seem pretty cool. :)
Yep, thank you, I had to change to array.Length but now the other problem is at the LoadGame, line 150
I would strongly suggest a custom class as /u/FizixMan suggested. It will help a lot because if you aren't keeping all those arrays in sync, you have a problem. The separate array is one of those patterns that bites you pretty quickly in development.
Yup. HKT and immutable records are really all I desire from c# anymore. And maybe implicit class instances or typeclasses
Type aliases (it's called using alias directive) are in C# for quite a long time :) try: using Dur = Herpity.Derpity; 
I don't know yet what a custom class is, I haven't learned that yet.. but I will search it and try to understand it
I don't know. If you have more than one hero saved, your arrays are not big enough. For instance "static string[] HeroName = new String[1];" only allows room for one hero. Try writing to the console the value in a1[1] like Console.WriteLine("a1[1] is " + a1[1]); and see if it is a valid string. Other that, can't see what's wrong.
&gt; In business this is unacceptable. All systems recover from exceptions. Even if it crashes, pours petrol over the server and burns down the data centre, we still recover from the exception eventually. So simply stopping the process is not acceptable. You need to include sufficient information for a manual intervention to fix it \(Or rely on their wicked reconciliation skills \(Thanks Dave\)\) OR you recover automatically. Each option requires more than "just" an exception. That's not what I meant. The current business transaction do not recover, but there is no reason to kill the whole application/system. Most application frameworks and libraries have integration points where you can pick up unhandled exceptions and determine what to do next. If that's not possible, having try/catch in the top layer is sufficient. I agree. discussions like this one allows you to re\-evaluate your standpoint and learn something new in the process. Thank you for it.
Firstly doing projects like this is the way to go! Keep it fresh but small. A game is ambitious and maybe look to useful tools you need for your next projects, etc. You should debug with breakpoints and start to look at the variable values. You’ll start to understand how the program reads your code. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y740d9d3.aspx Or in unity3d mono develop : https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/monodevelops-debugger Good luck! 
&gt;HeroName\[i\] \+ "|" \+ HeroClass\[i\]\+ "|" \+ HeroLevel\[i\]\+"|" \+ WeaponAtk\[i\] \+ "|" \+ WeaponName\[i\] \+ "|" \+ ArmorDef\[i\] \+ "|" \+ ArmorName\[i\] \+ "|" \+ HeroGold\[i\]; ``` public class Hero { public string Name { get;set; } public string Class { get; set; } public int Level { get; set; } public ... } ```
How did I not know this?!?! :0 I learn something new about C# all the time. Like, I just learned this morning about the `unmanaged` generic constraint.
For me it's always been CTRL+E,D. Apparently I'm the minority.
THANKS!
You should be able to figure it out by concatenating the result of this with `config.txt` // returns directory name of executing assembly Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)
Oh, so you *don't* want the current file path. Something to always keep in mind is that current file path is something that can be passed to the application on startup. Some background: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.workingdirectory(v=vs.110).aspx 
 Why not just give it a time out? Something like: ` var task = MyAsyncTask(cancellationToken); if (await Task.WhenAny(task, Task.Delay(2000, cancellationToken)) == task) { await task; } else { throw new Exception("This test out of time!"); }` I wouldn't recommend this, if a test is taking way to long, regardless of why, it should be monitored anyway, as this could happen on any method, not just an async one.
Or properly handle it and allow safe cancellation of any other tasks (eg using cancellation tokens): internal class Program { private readonly static ManualResetEvent _manualResetEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false); internal static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); Console.CancelKeyPress += HandleExit; // Application logic here. _manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); } internal static void HandleExit(object sender, ConsoleCancelEventArgs eventArguments) { Console.WriteLine("Safely exiting."); Thread.Sleep(3000); eventArguments.Cancel = true; _manualResetEvent.Set(); } }
Aren't shapes essentially Tuples? ``` (int x, int y) coordinates = (x = 0, y = 1); ```
It looks like your statement is accurate. I didn't realize that the file path changes when a task scheduler runs the .exe file. This means that the config file is somewhere entirely different. I even tried what u/AltMoola suggested, but when running the task scheduler, System32 becomes the new directory, which I don't want since the config.txt file is not carried with it. I read the article you posted, but I'm also relatively new to C# so I don't understand how to use the "UseShellExecute" property to get around this problem.

Hard to say offhand. I'm not a fan of the CRTP since it can have other pitfalls aside from what Lippert writes. another option may be (depending on specifics) to use a constraint: `public abstract T Add&lt;T&gt;(T left, T right) where T: AbstractBaseClass;` this still requires type information, but is less likely to lead to bizarre brain-teasers down the road. Another option would be an interface with a constraint to implement: ``` public interface ICanHazAdded&lt;out T&gt; where T:AbstractBaseClass { T Add(T left, T right) where T:Test; } ```
I agree, winforms is extremely robust framework, and funnily enough the older you go the more robust and efficient the frameworks where, even dynosours like atl/mfc have nothing to envy from modern ones in terms of performance and reliability. Its just that the whole industry is shifting to those easy to produce and easy to debug stuff that do require lots of ironing out, this was the indent from the very first visual studio release anyway. As for the haters, chill, we all know have experience on them, from stubborn higher ups, to younger people wanting to be in the cutting edge of stuff while scoffing on the old, it is what it is and there is no reason to be mad at them. 
In task manager you can set the "start in" folder to your application and then it should work without any code changes. The option will be right next to where you set the application path and arguments
&gt; Constructor Parameter Promotion Looks a lot like Kotlin... although for C# getters and setters are already easy enough. But for Java? man it sucks. class Person(val name : String, val age : Int) { fun printDetails() { println("Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}") } }
It's works on a per file basis though.
You 2.1.300-rc1-008673 in order to even build Blazor app. 
First of all, it should really be, if(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(textBox1.SelectedText)){ textBox1.Cut() } What happens if you have a form field that has just white space? In that case, your test above will fail, since there is *something* there, but it is only white space. According to the documentation, `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace()` evaluates to: return String.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || value.Trim().Length == 0; So by putting the bang in front of it, you evaluate if something is *not* null, an empty string, or a string of spaces only.
That consistant constructors is pretty cool for sure. Also +1 for all your sample code making me chuckle
Well, it was piqued at least. 
Line 2 needs to be a WriteLine method call if you want to send text to the console. 
Probably wants string name = Console.Write("What is your name "); so the question is on the same line as the answer.
&gt; no overload for method ReadLine Whenever you see "no overload for method" it means the version of ReadLine you are trying to use doesn't exist. Usually that's because you are passing the wrong parameters to it.
you can write your own "helper" method to do what you'd like to do: public static string GetUserInput(string str) { Console.WriteLine(str); return Console.ReadLine(); } then use like string input = GetUserInput("what is your name?");
How come everybody hates haskell, but when programmers request feature for other languages, most of the feature came from haskell.
it worked i dont understand thou before i added the second readline it worked but then all of a sudden when i added the second readline line 2 became a issue and had to be re written as Console.Write\("what is your name "\);string name = Console.ReadLine\(\); why is that ? it worked before the second readline
Are you sure that "Console.Write" can "read" the input? &gt;Console.Write Method &gt; &gt;Writes the text representation of the specified value or values to the standard output stream. [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en\-us/library/system.console.write\(v=vs.110\).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.write(v=vs.110).aspx)
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.useshellexecute(v=vs.110).aspx
For smart casts you can use in c# if (foo is Bar bar)
Typo 
When you say "it worked", do you mean it compiled and ran? If so, I am not at all sure how that happened. If you mean it didn't show an error, (i.e. red underline) it could just be that your IDE was being a little slow. I'm using visual studios 2017 and it immediately warned me that Console.ReadLine doesn't take any arguments.
I'd suggest reading up on reference counting Garbage Collection cuz that what C#/.NET/CLR does
Why are you manually including it? Anyway, have you set Specific Version off at the bottom of properties on that reference?
This might not be immediately useful for this particular problem (though it might!) but it might be useful in general for you when facing these kinds of design problems: https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part-one/ four part series, a good read. tldnr -&gt; don't feel like you have to implement this idea with a class and a bunch of derived classes if it only causes you dilemmas. 
You're trying to use inheritance as a data structure and its causing all sorts of issues, it seems. 
The test should just time out. Same thing happens if you got an infinite loop for normal test.
Try F#
You need to convert many of your classes to interfaces. If your class is a verb, it's an interface.
&gt;There is only one thing I like in VB: the ability to restrain parameters to constants within a class. I'm guessing you're thinking of the `&lt;completionlist&gt;` XML comment. It's not actually a language feature or constraint, just a suggestion for Intellisense.
Starting with [C#7](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mazhou/2017/06/27/c-7-series-part-4-discards/) you can use single `_` as discards
There may be a better data structure for this design. Maybe a doubly-linked list, where each item in the collection has a reference to its predecessor and also its successor. With the current design you are exploring, you could: Create an IQuestBlock interface which contains the method PullInfo(), and have all QuestBlock classes implement this interface. Your collection of questblocks would then be something like IEnumerable&lt;IQuestBlock&gt;. To determine the type of Info you get back from the PullInfo() method, you can look at the returned object's type, like so: if(info is LocationInfo) // do stuff else if (info is NPCInfo) // do other stuff Sorry for the poor formatting, just a quick brain dump.
Also, it's spelled the same way in C++. #define is something else entirely. 
Sounds cliche but make a game. Youll find hundreds of people in not just programming that are in the same position as you. Youll encounter countless amounts of issues or problems. The best part is youll be able to see your results visual and makes testing and prototyping fun. Game dev isnt just limited games as well. Youll need tools for tracking statistics, networking, audio, whatever you decide to do there is work to be done and youll get a lot if experience out of it.
I usually just use the menu options under Edit. But I installed the CodeMaid extension and it reformats the code every time I save it. Works pretty well mostly except sometimes it screws up my comments.
"Constructor Parameter Promotion" overlaps significantly with the record types that have been proposed for ages. Also a feature that F# already has, though I don't think either the F# feature or the C# proposal supports anything but public accessibility.
If I need to achieve this effect, I prefer Console.ReadLine(); because it waits for an enter, whereas Console.ReadKey(); will exit if you accidentally push the spacebar or something like that. IDK, I guess it's just more reliable.
Do you need to be able to work in the UK? Or are you accepting overseas remote contractor options too?
There are other options, like Visual Studio Code and JetBrains Rider. Personally, I'd recommend VS Code.
Ahh, must have missed that. Tried to check but couldn't find anything and was on my phone when writing.
We use Wix and once it is set up it just works.
Yeah I tried to say that. Just accidentally wrote as instead of is. I don't like how I have to name the variable explicitly when the compiler should know that it can't be anything else inside the if block (or the case block in a switch)
I’m not sure what you mean by ‘proxy IPs’, but it does highlight an important flaw in your design: when you key players by their remote IP, you’ll quickly get into problems when multiple players connect through the same outbound IP address. This will happen when players connect through a NAT router, or when they actually use a proxy. IP addresses might also change when their connection is handed off from WiFi to 4G or vice versa. 
^ this is pretty much what I was going to suggest. If you have a ref to your parent quest object you can just do something like ` if(parentQuest is ILocationQuest) { // do a thing } `
`Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location))`
I would have a Quest class that simply has a list of quest blocks. This way the quest has access to all the blocks and can do anything it needs. Or you could use a decorator pattern and pass the previous block into the next ones constructor and store it. Or a linked / double linked list. Personally I would create a quest class and let it manage the blocks.
The core concepts are the same. Learn them first. C# 6 / 7 add a lot of really useful/awesome features and you should absolutely learn them. But learn the basics first.
Not op but just wondered how would you handle this? My first thought is give each player a token and respond to whatever ip sends that token.
The way threading works has changed several times since then, we currently have async await as well as a lot of new threading primitives. LINQ was introduced in 2007 with 3.5, that's huge. These things all use the core language features, interfaces or threadpool or whatever, but they take some time to get used to. If your ebooks are so old that they don't have generics in, bin them (delete them?) otherwise you'll at least get a vague understanding. We learn to code so we can code. If you end up reading someone else's code written after 2007ish you might have a hard time understanding some of it.
95% of those is just some syntactic sugar to save you few keystrokes (and improve readability), but you still need to learn the "long version".
Those naming conventions make me head hurt. Look at using test cases to pass in parameters. Then you can run the same test multiple times with different data.
whats the exception? also you need to create a class for the hero not doing in this way, the loop youre doing is on HeroSheet.Length but you are accessing other variables.
Look into Json serializer and deserializer. You may be able to serialise the information from one class \(e.g. the location \-\- When location changes, store the previous location in a json file externally \(desktop, maybe even github\). Then you want to have a method that deserialises the information when needed \(or straight away\) and stores it in the other class \(use LISTS\&lt;\&gt; for storing a "list" of locations/ location changes. 
Why not handle it at the connection/session level? The player connects, does some kind of handshake and you know which player is on that socket. But as the post above said, IP addresses is about the worst indicator you could use. They are not unique.
Is somelib.dll built in core? If it's a full framework dll that may be why you are having issues. 
The VS formatter doesn't arrange code to the extent ReSharper does. I haven't seen tool come close to the abilities that ReSharper has.
I do use CodeMaid. Formatting is good for new code, but for older code that didn't follow current standards not so much.

This doesn't need explaining, Jon Skeet is our master. Nah but really, every C# developer with a bit of experience should read the 3rd edition to really understand C# and how it evolved. This 4th edition includes the 3rd edition as well, so it almost feels like stealing. This much quality/content for such a low price is insane.
There really are two arguments that are passed, the first argument is just the reference that you call the extension method on. Unlike normal member calls, the dot doesn't de-reference the object. So unlike a normal member call, the *object can be null*. In the case of `Enumerable.Where`, you do not get a `System.NullReferenceException`, you get a `System.ArgumentNullException`. If no exception is thrown by the extension method, you don't get any exception. So the reason as to why you still see the `this` parameter in extension methods, it's to show it's an extension method, and `this` may be null.
&gt; If your ebooks are so old that they don't have generics in, bin them (delete them?) otherwise you'll at least get a vague understanding. Generics exist in Java too, so I'd hope they learned a bit about those even if there are some implementation differences in them between Java and C#.
Though I published a blog post showing that only the subscriber isn't collected if it goes out of scope while the opposite works fine
Unlocking books by paragraphs, is this really the direction we are taking?
For small projects, MS has a Visual Studio Installer Project extension that you can download and works pretty well.
It's close - and definitely enjoyable - but different.
Well you can just buy the whole book obviously. But yes, you can also unlock only certain chapters or paragraps if you only want that content. I don't really know what to think of that, I don't think I'll use that anytime soon. Or are you referring to the fact that you can buy this book before it's done and have to wait for the other chapters to complete? You can also wait for it to finish, but this is extra motivation for the writer. It's exactly the same with all other forms of early access, like unfinished games.
I am refering to the "buy paragraphs for funbucks" feature the site tries to sell.
 I wouldn't use "early access"games as a means of describing anything if you're trying to sell someone on the idea. I'm not siding one way or another.
You probably misunderstood what I asked in my post. I already have both a central list inside the Quest class and a linked list between the Questblocks. The question was about having some kind of protocol that can pass arbitrary information between the questblocks, so one could pass a location, while another a list of npc-s for example.
The book is not even done yet, how the hell can you buy it then? It's not software or something else that has a beta thing. 
I know the website tries to sell that, however this discount has nothing to do with that. It's an early access book. Therefor I figured you meant something else. Apart from that, see the first paragraph ^pun ^intended of my original reply to you for my opinion on it :)
I'm not selling anyone any idea! I was just stating that the concept of early access to books just very similar to all other early access things :) But /u/klaxxxon meant something else entirely. So it's a bit misplaced now I guess.
I really, honestly, fail to see the difference between books and software. But of course, I respect your opinion on it! I'm not that big on paying for early access either. This could be my first time actually. But that's mainly because I really like the 3rd edition and like the author. For me personally, it's quite a safe bet. Especially with the discount and the fact that you get the complete 3rd edition as well.
I've used [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) a lot in the past. Liked it very much.
The problem with doing a list of Interfaces like you suggest is that when I create the QuestBlocks inside the Quest class (that stores the interfaces list in this example) that I want to have access to variables I want to set inside each Questblock such as previousBlock and nextBlock. 
Not quite sure what you mean? I would have a IKillNPC, IInteractEntity, IGotoLocation interfaces? What's the point if all of them would be implemented by a single QuestBlock class at that point then?
I tried VS Code but couldn't make it work
Can someone lend me twenty dollars? Or send me the third edition?
Now we early access books? Back in the day, beta testing books used to be free. Hope this is no a "thing".
.NET -stole-, ah, implemented Generics after Java had them for years.
Like others have said, those books will cover the basics. If you're looking for a new book, I just finished this one: [Pro C# 7](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484230176) by Andrew Troelsen. It explains the older way of doing things then shows the newer way. He even covers .Net Core stuff as well. 
This is not "early access", its half a book that they expect you to pay for. World of difference. And even doing a 50% off on it is weirder, seieng as you have no guarantee of a finished product. Its like paying for a kickstarter...
Our company code may be able to singlehandedly set that possibility back by several years if they use it as an input in machine learning.
I beg to differ. It's actually **exactly** like "early access". You get the content that's finished at the point you buy it and all the updates until completion afterwards. Exactly what "early access" for a game entails to as well; buy the game in it's current state and updates thereafter. It's really **not** like paying for a kickstarter; because with kickstarter you buy a promise for completion of some product. In the mean time, you get zero, zilch, nothing. Buying this book now, gives you immediate access to the current content. So, no, not like kickstarter at all and everything like "early access" program. I cannot explain this more clearly than the above.
No, the CLR does *not* use reference counting (well, except for some stuff like COM interop). The mainline CLR uses a generational tracing GC ("mark and sweep").
We're talking about *Jon Skeet* here. The book will be finished.
Because in the future your class library will expand and other entities in your system will implement the behavior in the interface. Also, re-read what I originally wrote: classes are nouns and you listed verbs, which should be interfaces.
How is this different than "in a Nutshell" books.
&gt; the hell can you buy it then I think I agree with your sentiment in terms of the trend. However, you can just...not buy it ;\-\)
Good question! I'm not sure on that, because I never read the "in a nutshell" series. What I do know, is that the 3rd edition goes deep into why C# is how it is and how it became in it's current state. It started with C#1 and it's problems, and made it's way up through the versions highlighting what changed, what problems were solved and how. Obviously it teaches you ways to use C# in a lot of variations but it also explains the language itself, I guess? Hard to describe :) I think that the 3rd edition will be different from a typical "nutshell" book. I haven't yet read the 4th edition, but looking at the chapter list it is taking a different approach than the 3rd edition. It's less based on chapters by C# versions and more chapters by techniques that are now possible and how to use them. Could be more comparable to the "nutshell" series in that regard.
&gt; C# 7.2 has introduced [...] Reference semantics with value types That's not really true. Passing by reference has always been in the language. Now it can be used in more places and in slightly different ways.
&gt; The way threading works has changed several times since then, we currently have async await as well as a lot of new threading primitives. You'd probably not normally call that threading, but rather futures and asynchronous programming models.
It's the other way around, friend.
It's not really a question of carrying dll's over as much as referencing them when the current project is compiled.
I don't know, I think it's mostly a Manning thing thus far. Plus, beta testing books usually meant proofreading (finished but raw) books. And this is a stage before that in my opinion. They explain their reasons for this on a specific page: https://www.manning.com/meap-program You can either agree or disagree with it, but I get their reasoning :)
Some people only want to buy certain parts of a book so they're just offering the ability to do that for customers who want it. It's new for Manning, but other sites have done it before. I wouldn't normally do it but if everything in a book was irrelevant to me except one chapter, I would buy just that chapter at a fraction of the price.
Huh, always thought it was a combo of both. But primarily reference counting. I need to buy that clr book
Essentially the idea here is to raise the state of progress up out of `QuestBlocks`, and instead of "pulling" information into the current block from somewhere else, you "push" the information into each block as you go. In your example, what do you do if you have a `Talk` block after two `Kill` blocks? Your `QuestProgressMessage` can contain a stack of `VisitedLocations`, a stack of `KilledNPCs`, etc. Each block then generates the next `QuestProgressMessage` by copying the values from the previous one making any necessary modifications in the process. Each block only uses the information it needs. Does that make sense?
This is not just a Manning thing, nor were they first with the concept. Pretty much all tech publishers offer access to early drafts now. I think O’Reilly started it.
Apress has been using the same sales tactic of buying by chapter. [Example](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484231494)
Just an impression from what you're saying, but it sounds more like the data should be parameters passed to the QuestBlock that needs it, rather than something it should have to fish for for itself. So a Talk block could be passed a collection of possible NPCs, a collection of excluded NPCs, a collection of possible locations, a collection of excluded locations, etc. The Talk block is in charge of making sensible decisions based on that data, but somewhere else (presumably the Quest class) is in charge of passing it the data, and then dealing with its output and using that to decide what data to give to the next QuestBlock.
Thanks for correcting!
&gt; Have used Java for class (hate it, sorry) No need to apologise here; hating on Java is cool in this sub.
Yes, I mixed my metaphors. There are new threading primitives like the xxxSlim versions of thing like semaphore and then there was the progression of async patterns from Async design pattern (1.1) -&gt; Event based async pattern (2.0) -&gt; Observer pattern (3.x) -&gt; Task based async pattern -&gt; async await I'm quite lazy sometimes :)
Yes true, my concern was more learning the old way of doing things in C# pre generics. Do you remember how we used to make concrete lists with hand rolled IEnumerator/IEnumerable for a specific type? It would probably be useful to know how those interfaces are used anyway I guess :)

Well they were closer than I thought, had to look it up. But when I went to implement a project at C# wasn’t there yet early 2006 java was... Officially C# 2.0 introduction of generics was end of 2005, Java 5.0 released mid 2005. But in reality Java was better documented at that time (for some reason) and usable - ignoring the onslaught of updates. C# 2.0 - I felt was more available a year later. I could be wrong. Sincerely, Friend ;)
What does the json of `price` look like?
Does this get you what you're looking for? ([0-9]+\s[0-9]+) I saved this in RegExr so you can play with it and see an explanation of how it works: https://regexr.com/3pkdo
Your suggestion violates the Open-Closed principle (OCP) and ignoring the advantages of polymorphism. Adding another type of info means a change to the method doing the `if (infoType)` check (violating OCP). Instead of taking advantage of polymorphism, we ignore it by branching based on an object's type. A better way to model this problem would be to turn quests into data and creating a structure that models that data. *Other* classes then use this data to determine the proper behavior of the client. The structure should be immutable once it is read from wherever quest data is stored. Another class would be responsible for translating that data into applicable behaviors and passing the behaviors to a "QuestManager" class. The manager class would subscribe, directly or indirectly, to events or messages like "monster killed" or "item picked up" and would then pass that information to all the individual objects that are managing the state of each quest and tracking their progress. Significant events, like a quest being completed, would be published by the manager class. Any subscribers to that event could then act accordingly (like increasing experience upon quest completion). While not perfect, this will decouple a quest system from other systems and help ensure segregation and the Single Responsibility principle.

Thanks, I'll play around with it! 
That's not what I meant. I meant that most of the time it works great, but some of the time it gets confused and moves my comments all over the place. For example, if I comment out an entire method with control-k, control-c and then save it, it will sometimes split up the commented out method and spread it all over the .cs file.
Relatively new\-ish C# developer here. Should I also purchase the 3rd edition of this book if I want to dive deep into the language?
This might help too: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/1830205
&gt;Finals are done and I can FINALLY start...Thanks for that London, It helped and i found out what route i want to go.
It made me really understand most of regex, but this was a senior level class years ago in uni.
Just pre-ordered. Thanks for sharing!
I was super excited finding out about it, too! Searching for C# on the twitch site didn't work so well for me. But today I found [this](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams) handy list of programming streams on github. Also some unity3d live streams among them, for those interested in game development in C#.
Nope, built in standard about 8 years ago. No updates since. I was hoping that the automatic shim would work.
You're basically pre-ordering, which you can do already, except you get to read the book as it's being finished rather than wait until the release date. If for some reason the author decides to bail, you get your money back.
what's rule 1? You can't post that you have a job? Are you kidding me?
Ow yeah definitely. Its only temporary. What happens now is a player connects to the server and I send game updates to the player through the IP the address that he initiated the connection. Even though my testing module can spawn 100 players. They all have the same IP so when they join I am only sending all the information once. But if it were 100 different players I would have to send the current game state 100 times. \(thats the part I am trying to test\) But yeah you guys are right that I shouldn't use IP as a key. 
IdentityServer4 seems to be the standard solution for ASP.NET Oauth2. Pretty great instructions [here](http://docs.identityserver.io/en/release/quickstarts/0_overview.html)
You can use Newtonsoft.Json to easily manipulate Json data - might be a bit out of your league at first but keep trying - https://www.newtonsoft.com/json Also, in general, for uploading to GitHub you'd use the git GUI or CLI (shell/terminal/cmd). Use a .gitignore file to not publish sensitive information. The code you provided we cant build anything, just FYI - in case you werent just looking for a quick code review
I am using Newtonsoft's Json here, where would I need to use it where I'm currently not? About github; I'm trying to get into it, I've managed to download bash and cloned a few open source projects but not much more. Any recommended guides on how to use it effectively?
well github and git are not the same - github is a platform to push your code and share it with others easily - think like a "social media" site git is version controll system at anyrate i suggested Newtonsoft.Json to deserialize your .json file instead of your own custom class. just doing a quick pass here.
nevermind then, guess I skimmed/assumed too fast :)
I think you are going to get a lot more flexibility and options to clean up your code if you establish a proper domain language via some model classes and having JSON.NET handle the serialization for you. 
It's difficult because almost all programming gets lumped into the vague programming community. Similarly, I'd feel weird say I broadcast a specific language when I normally live stream the whole stack.
So instead of having a ConvertToJson I should have a method that separates the name and ID, and serializes that using a class , something like this: (Class Item { public string Name { get; set; } public string ID { get; set; } } ) , and then writes the serialized object?
Just watching the poor chap recycle subscription keys! I watch it on YouTube though. But it’s an excellent resource. 
yes [use this to get started](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/SerializingJSON.htm) note that you will likely end up adding some decorators to the model classes and possibly a helper class to make things work. Essentially you push the plumbing out of your main implementation and try to boil it down to an abstract conversation among your domain objects. Done well you can sometimes make your top level class implementation look very much like the business requirement doc you are implementing. 
It's too bad Akka.NET doesn't get more love. Anyone who's dealing with concurrency scenarios/challenges should give it a try.
Thanks!
I have no idea what an NRE error is, but the class containing the combo box should expose the selected item as a property.
Just curious, have no desire to live in the city (im a country kinda guy) but what would the salary be?
 File.ReadLines(fileName).Select(x =&gt; x.Split('|')).Select(x =&gt; $"{x[1]} {x[2]}, {Regex.Replace(x[7], "\\D", "")}"); String.Split() will turn the string into an array, where separators (which you specify) denote the start and end of elements in the resulting array. From there, you can just pull out the elements you want by indexing into the array. You can use a regular expression to nuke everything in the phone number that isn't a number, but you may want to consider a more specific pattern like " \\(\\)-", which would match *just* spaces, parens, and hyphens. Or, you could chain a couple calls to String.Replace().
Optional semicolons is a terrible idea. 
I also thought it was the other way around... until I looked up the dates. Java 5 launched with generics on September 30, 2004. C# 2.0 launched with generics sometime in November 2005, although I couldn't track down the exact date. Visual Studio 2005 was the first editor that supported C# 2.0, launching in January 2006. So yes, going by either date, Generics were in Java a full year before they hit C#. Although this discussion is somewhat moot as both languages seemed to model their generics after C++'s class templates.
The socket itself will be unique, no need to add the handshake.
It's actually easier if you do it permanently rather than temporarily. Temporarily you have to fake coming from 100 IPs, if you do it permanently with source IP as the key then you simply need to launch 100 instances from a single IP.
...why are you implementing a cut command that can't cut whitespace? That seems like an odd thing to do.
When you populate a combox box, unless you set its SelectedIndex or SelectedItem, then the SelectedItem property remains null until the user changes the selection. The easy way is to just return the ComboBox.Text property, which will return an empty string if the user has not selected an item.
I set the DataSource and SelectedItem like this: candleLengthCB.DataSource = intervals; candleLengthCB.SelectedItem = "oneMinute"; When I try to get the SelectedItem or Text property from within the class of the combobox, everything is fine. But when I try to get it from other classes then SelectedItem returns null and Text returns nothing.
standard didn't exist 8 years ago. What do you mean by "standard"?
/u/Canthros has good advice here. Another option that is a little more elegant is [FileHelpers](https://www.filehelpers.net/). It takes a little bit of the boilerplate out when dealing with delimited files.
Split() is a wonderful function. I use it a lot in the way you describe. The only suggestion I would add is to always test the size of the array returned by Split. If you know that you should always have 7 elements, check the array size after the split and only access the individual pieces if the array size is right. That way if you get a truncated chunk of data you don't get an index exception. How you handle this kind of issue is a good question: skip that row, or just punt completely?
Yeah checking the array size is a must when doing this. It only takes one extra delimiter to mess it all up. Handling the data being wrong is tricky. Personally, I've done stuff like write it to a table, send it to email or append it to the end of the output file (or a new file all together) under an "errors" section. Sometimes I've just flat out ignored it if ultimately one or two missing lines won't be the end of the world. Other times one or two missing lines were unacceptable and I had to write some logic to fix it mid parse, it was a pain.
You would have to post the code for both the form (or control) containing the combo box as well as the calling code trying to access it.
I met him a couple years ago at a code conference, now I see him all over the place! Really nice guy. Very cool.
So the 49.99 version gives a physical 4th edition, a 3rd edition pdf.. And a "livebook"?
&gt; I tried to set up OpenVPN recently For that specifically, there are Windows OpenVPN clients that don't involve command-line nonsense. Server side, pfSense seems to work the best.
Any examples of what you hadn't used?
All types are inherited from **System.Object** tpye. Even when you create your own types, they are inherited from **System.Object** type, too. Unfortunately, I do not know why it is there in the language. I guess it is just how C# is.
MS Exam Ref 70-483. 2nd edition may be available now on Amazon. It's way deeper than just those things, by a long shot. It's a very compact book but it hits on all things you'll need. Good luck and happy coding!
Because that is how Smalltalk works, everything is an object and the universe starts with Object class. So many OOP languages that came after Smalltalk got themselves inspired by this idea, including Java. Given that C# 1.0 was just Microsoft's way to keep using Java after the lawsuit, many C# 1.0 features got themselves inspired by Java semantics and syntax. 
 TextFieldParser parser = new TextFieldParser(fullPath); parser.TextFieldType = FieldType.Delimited; parser.Delimiters = new string[] { "~" }; string[] parsedVals = new string[] { "" }; while (!parser.EndOfData) { parsedVals = parser.ReadFields(); } return parsedVals;
Thank you very much 😊
Any time my dude or dudette. 
Before generics system.object was the only way to have some collection types.
Np. It can also happen in asp/webdev with webservices - you might get your structured json/xml data that you requested OR an exception, formatted in json/xml and sometimes, gawd knows what else they might return. OR, let's say you catch an exception in a fx and instead of returning the expected string, it may make sense to return the actual exception instead of standard handling/bubbling up techniques. Return object... 
It is base of good type system. Google top type and bottom type. C# implementation of top and bottom type is not that good because it copies Java which is terrible.
Yes I believe that's correct. I bought the digital version of the 4th and it includes the 3rd edition in numerous formats. The only stated difference with the $49,99 version is the addition of a paperback of the fourth but the 3rd remains digital I think (otherwise I'm pretty sure they'd state it for promotional purposes). "Livebook" is Manning's version of an online ebook reader, with some additional functions like comments and such. But basically just an online ebook reader :)
I'm pretty sure it won't deep dive into MVC, because the books are really about C# itself; not the framework which you use it in. I don't have any MVC book recommendations for you though, sorry!
bump anyone ?
&gt; If you make a variable of type object, you can literally put anything in it. Except you really shouldn't, unless there's no way around it. I know this is basic, but so was OP's question, so that's a bad thing to suggest.
Check out the Video Tutorials section in the sidebar ===&gt; (If you're on mobile, click the "About this community" link near the top of the page to see the sidebar content.)
Thank you very much for your time. I think i will go for the exam book, because I already know C#. If I see something that I am not familiar with I will look at the docs. :\)
Because everything in .NET "is an object" there is a base type, `System.Object`, to represent that. That base type has the common methods which all types expose, such as ToString, GetType &amp; GetHashCode. It is also used directly as a general "reference to a non-specific type", with all the capabilities of a reference - you can take locks against it, you can compare types &amp; referential equality with it. In C/C++, the equivalent would be `void*`.
&gt; Where did you hear that bit of nonsense? There are lots of soureces; Irrc I read it definitly in Roy Osheroves book "tha art of unit testing". But to me it makes perfect sense: All kind of control flow makes a test complicate to read and understand. On top you interoduce the halting problem into your testcode, if you use any kind of looping. &gt; The first time you need to verify child collections on a result you're going to need a loop. Not sure what you mean exactly. Simply nested Collections? Like this? Dictionary&lt;int, List&lt;string&gt;&gt; As I ave only a depper experience with NUnit, I can tell you they have lots of good [matchers](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Constraints) in order to support you in writing assertions. I was always able to create an assertion simply with their predefined matchers. (Ok, they call it *constraint*, as technically the matcher is only the [Assert.That](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Constraint-Model)-Matcher, that evaluates towards a given constraint) But of course there might be cases where the predefined constraints won't suffice anymore. But then it might be a good Idea to implement a custom constraint - especially, if you need this kind of matching more than once. BTW: During my research I found this (quite new) feature: [Multiple Asserts](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Multiple-Asserts). I will examine this but I think I like the idea and the syntactical construct; it will make such assserts much easier than the nesting approach I have described earlier!
Where did you get it? It is only available in August
That means it's a full framework assembly and will most likely be the reason core is struggling to reference it. .Net standard has only been around a couple years and != full framework.
Do lots of practice tests, and when you see something you want to know more about, read the docs. The practice tests on measureup.com are very good and similar to the real exam (albeit very expensive). Has excellent explanations on why the right answers are right, and the wrong answers are wrong. 
Thanks a lot 🙏 
The phrase "you can" is not synonymous with "you should" or "I suggest that you"
True. But that's like saying answering a question - 'hey, I'm new to tools, what are knives for?' with 'Tools used to cut things, you can for example cut your wrists with these'. Technically correct and you're not suggesting anything - but the possibility for damage is huge :)
But there are many examples of where you *should* do this too. Serialisation libraries that can serialise any data type, or passing a model to a view in ASP.NET MVC, are two that immediately come to mind. So while I agree that this isn't something you will need to do often, it's certainly something that OP should be aware of as a possibility, and its a perfectly valid answer to OP's question.
Yeah, let's do an 8 hour workshop in the middle of the work day...
First of all - most modern serialization approaches would simply use generics. Second of all - OP asked what 'System.Object' is - are we sure they're ready to tackle such concepts at the moment? I'm not exactly questioning the correctness of this answer, I'm questioning whether it was something that should really be mentioned in a very short and concise answer. Especially if, hope we can agree, there is a huge potential for misuse and a very narrow potential for applications OP has any chance of encountering in the foreseeable future.
You can watch it later via VOD though.
I agree, it would have been sweet to have it on the weekend. I'm lucky, being in Germany, it starts in the late afternoon for me.
We'll have to agree to disagree. Using System.Object-type variable to hold "anything in it" is a serious anti-pattern (and one that a person not understanding basics will very easily follow). Sure - there are times you need to do this, but this must be an informed choice. &gt; The .NET framework documentation doesn't come with such a warning It doesn't suggest the 'hold anything in it approach' at all, so I there's no need for a warning.
Nobody is making a suggestion.
You will absolutely need the docs. This is, in my opinion, often understated. The exam reference often contains things like "for more information see &lt;article on mdsn&gt;". In normal books this is just extra information you could skip. However I've found that for this book and good exam preparation, you'll really have to follow those links and study that content. Otherwise you _will_ miss things that they'll ask. Apart from that I want to add that: if you can't acquire the newest edition of the reference book (I think it's still not out), you'll need to practise things that aren't in the book at all. Mainly C# things added after C#5. Most importantly pattern matching. Also, make sure you've really practised with linq. 
Hi /u/goxdin Yes, I'm afraid being able to work in the UK is a requirement.
I'm not really convinced this is the key point of my argument, but let me rephrase: It doesn't ~~suggest~~ mention the 'hold anything in it approach' at all, so I there's no need for a warning.
Thats awesome! I really hope whole workshop will be uploaded on youtube or remains av a ilable on twitch, I cant participate atm but would love to go through the content... either way great job!
Vue and .Net Core is my kind of jam, I might drop by the stream some time, if you're streaming when I'm online.
Oh I had sympathy for you that’s for sure, you handled it well though and these things happen. Nothing like some live yak shaving! Fairly new YouTube subscriber of yours so I dip in and out and am catching up on old streams when I can. Nothing like this in the old Visual interdev days! 
I got some experience with linq, but i will practise more. Thank you 🙏 
You're missing the libgit2 shared object, I'm on Arch Linux and to get this file I need to install the package [libgit2](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libgit2/). I don't know what system you're on, but you probably just have to find the package that contains libgit2.so on your distro.
Jeff wrote in his [workshop Q&amp;A](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.LiveStream/tree/master/csharpWorkshop) "The content will be available for roughly 60 days on Twitch, and we will place videos on YouTube." so we should be good! I'm going to try to watch the whole thing, but in my timezone the end will be late at night, so I might have to rest when it gets uploaded, too.
You can't hire good senior .NET developers for 74K in the US anyways, so it's kind of a moot point.
Oh god, I really don't miss those days before Generics, where your code was 50% actual work, 50% casting
Looking at it now, I am pretty sure I am wrong about it breaking LSP. However, he *is* breaking the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because, by adding another derived type, he may/must change the implementation of that method to account for it. Furthermore, if he is looking for a specific type, he should simply overload the `add` method with the type he is looking for so that it communicates the idea more effectively to the calling code. Having a method that accepts a type and branching based on a specific type that inherits/implements that ancestor is purposefully avoiding the benefits of polymorphism. Furthermore, a base class *should not*, under any circumstance, have code that is dependent upon types that inherit from it -- it is a major code smell (hints at poor design) and, of course, breaks OCP. The accepted answer of [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4428725/can-you-explain-liskov-substitution-principle-with-a-good-c-sharp-example) actually maps quite well to what OP is trying to do as far as LSP/OCP is concerned. You can see how `ElectricDuck` breaks LSP of `IDuck` in one example. Then, in the example that fixes the LSP issue, it causes an OCP violation lol. &gt; would "Subtype is Type" be true? Yeah. Basically, if you can cast/convert the subtype to the "is" type, "is" will return true. More info [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/is).

There are valid uses for using object. Here’s an example: imagine you are writing a method that accepts an object, and the _only_ thing about that object your method needs in order to function is the object’s .ToString() implementation. String.Format() is a real world example of this type of method. Could you use a generic function to accept a “T” instead of object? Sure. But _that_ to me seems like an anti pattern. What is the point of using generics if you are absolutely doing nothing with it? You won’t have any type constraints. You wouldn’t need to get the type of “T.” Your method doesn’t need to return a type based on the input type. But take it further. Say your method needs to take in an array of objects, where, again, the only piece of each object you need is its ToString. Yet again, this is exactly how String.Format works. How would you do this with genetics? If you take in an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; instead of just IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;, the only way you’ll actually be able to provide a variety of objects from any source with no type relation is to yourself create an IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; and pass that in. I feel like you’re missing the point here, in other words. Yeah, “object” in a lot of cases is bad, but if you are using object and not assuming at any point that your object is in fact a higher type, what have you done wrong? You’ve left no room for unexpected error. It would be _more_ confusing to me to make a method generic when the generic method is literally accomplishing nothing but showing off an intermediate C# trick. If I was code reviewing a generic method that only used the input’s ToString(), or GetHashCode(), had no type constraints, and wasn’t using the generic type in any way, I would reject that submission honestly.
I've been thinking about how to model your idea for the last couple of days (hence my late reply). This is actually kind of difficult to model because I don't think this example "translates from english to object model" in the way that many other things do. My first thought was that a `Field` is a *set* of some numerical values and the operations that can be applied, which, "translating from english to object model", gets us the idea that a `Field` is a *collection* of a type of object that represents some numerical value that the `Field` accepts. In this case, your derived types don't inherit from the `Field` class at all. Rather, the `Field` type just knows how to perform the add/sub/mult/divide/etc operations on its elements. However, it makes *more* sense to add that type of code to the numerical value type (aka the derived types in your example) since it *should* know how to handle those operations. Assuming you've defined a `Real` type for real numbers, you could overload the mathematical ops (+, -, *, /) as well as the explicit/implicit operators and get this kind of behavior: Real r1 = 1.7D; //overload the implicit operator for double types to achieve this Real r2 = 42; //overload .... integer types Real r3 = r1 + r2; //overload + operator for Real types Real r4 = r3 + 42; //this should work without having to overload the + op for integers because we've already added the implicit operator overload for integers int narrowingType = Real.ToInt(r4); //add a static ToInt(Real) method int otherInt = r4.ToInt(); //add the ToInt() instance method If we define a `Real` type that behaves in that fashion (plus all the other ops I didn't use in that code), we've implicitly defined the *field* of all real numbers. However, all real numbers are complex numbers where a complex number is defined as `a + bi where a is a real number and b is an imaginary number and i satisfies the equation x^2 = -1`. In a real number, b = 0. So, if we do a translation from english to model, this feels like our `Real` type should inherit from a `Complex` type (an `Imaginary` type would also inherit from it). However, I think using inheritance in this fashion would be messier. Instead, we can define the "inheritance" by overloading the implicit operator for the `Complex` type on all types that would have inherited from such a type. Not perfect, but personally, I'd try to model how C# and languages in general handle implementing their numerical types. Define the types and their operations in their own **immutable structs** (which defines the field of that type implicitly) and define any conversions via overloading the implicit operator (so that our Real type kinda is a Complex type and, therefore, our Real type also belongs to the Complex field). I hope this helps. FWIW, this is an interesting thing to model, though difficult. 
Like every single event handler defined by the framework?
Good luck!
So can I take it that you've never done anything with reflection? Or `dynamic`? Because they both start with putting objects in `System.Object` variables.

It should be noted that I tried searching Google for variations of the Exception message but only seemed to find posts about Identity/Auth issues which doesn't affect my code.
No, you're just wrong. It's hilarious when shown proof of how wrong you are, that you ignore it and act like your objection is somehow on the same level. The input for any library like this is object. So when you serialize the data, the method you're calling takes an object. It is absolutely not an anti-pattern. In fact, just the opposite. It is good practice to accept the least concrete definition into a method. You don't need to take in a List when an IList can do, for example. Now, the output is where generics can be used to make things nice. Much of the time, however, all that generic overload is, is in providing the cast for you. There is no need for a warning period, because taking in objects doesn't do the trick unless you really actually want just an object.
`DateTime dateCreated = (DateTime)dt.row["DateCreated"].ToString()` or some shit lol I'm glad I dont deal with ADO.NET much anymore
How familiar are you with C# and programming? Regex is the way to go here, however many devs still struggle with grokking regex
 Why not just do the public DbSet&lt;Product&gt; Products {get;set;} ? That's the standard way of doing it, and allows for migrations. On top of that, you probably can't call set multiple times, you're setting the actual definition, so once you get it once (even if it could work) you could never do it again. Your first example (i've never used linq2sql) looks like it's just grabbing the definition, you're trying to set the definition in your second example. Why can't you just have multiple contexts if that's what you're going for?
OP, just do yourself a favor - spend $12 on this https://www.udemy.com/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners/ Mosh is a great teacher and you dont have to worry about not having a series stop midway through. You get all the basics of C# and programming for quite a steal, IMO, for $12
Protip: use nullable types and the `as` operator when dealing with DataTable values. Otherwise, use generic collections and LINQ.
Probably a regular joe kind of "Learn C# Book" but I've never bought one. I bought a Java book in undergrad (first semester comp Sci lel) and learned mainly how to program from IRC/chats, official docs/tutorials, SO, bit of reddit, and forums. Honestly I just practiced a shit ton and working as a programmer while going to school as well. So the first C# books I bought were C# in depth and C# in a nutshell, since those are for mid to advanced programmers
This was .NET 1.1 or .NET 2.0 original written code base lol. Didnt even have `var` T_T
Visual studio has a "Paste From JSON" option (Edit =&gt; Past Special =&gt; Past From JSON. This will create a C# class for you matching all the properties (nested included). Might help if you do end up with a large JSON file.
I think you are confusing two different posts OP doesnt mention exam at all
Oopsie. Undo!
Sorry, didnt mean to flame or anything. I just found the C# exam ref for a noob to be like a total "what?" moment. :D
No worries. See, i learnt me some c sharps on my own and just needed a rosetta stone kind of go-to doc and used the exam ref like that cuz i did the vee bees since v4 and knew what the languages could do - needed to learn the syntactical sugary goodness. And it became my presciouses... Now i code alone in my darkness and my other online guru voice bots in my brains. 
The Set method the OP is using isn't for setting a definition, it's for getting a set. [Here is the msdn page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontext.set?view=efcore-2.0). It returns DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt;.
The [reference source](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/Lazy.cs) explicitly overwrites m_valueFactory with an ALREADY_INVOKED_SENTINEL so that the one you passed in can be garbage collected.
Based on a quick scan of the [reference source](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/Lazy.cs), it looks like it releases the delegate the first time the value is requested.
&gt; Or do they null out the delegate they are using behind the scenes after it is lazily initialized Yes, it appears that they do. More specifically, they replace it with another delegate that throws an exception if they accidentally try to call it again, which frees the original delegate for the GC to take. https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/Lazy.cs,370
It's a lightweight type that can be used for simple locks.
I've never used Regex before. I'm assuming your solution works, and my code compiled, but I have no idea how to utilize what it creates. For example, I would normally type: var blah = File.ReadLines\(fileName\).Select\(x =\&gt; x.Split\('|'\)\).Select\(x =\&gt; $"{x\[1\]} {x\[2\]}, {Regex.Replace\(x\[7\], "\\\\D", ""\)}"\); Console.WriteLine\(blah\); But that just displays some random file path, not the sorted names and phone numbers.
I ended up using your solution, since I've never used Regex before. It works like a charm; thank you!
I'm intermediate at best. However, I'm not familiar with Regex. In fact I never knew it existed until I made this post. Time to start studying!
We use ComponentSpace SAML 2.0 for .net - works really well (and very easy if you do not need artifact resolution), but it is a commercial product.
Huh I had never knew that. Thank you.
Thanks for the heads up! 
Listboxes that use the `ToString` override to represent its items are pretty useful in UI too. 
`blah` is an IEnumerable. Loop through it and print out the values.
Woo! You’re welcome! Always nice to hear I helped 😀
The reference source replaces the factory with a sentinel while the .NET Core implementation just nulls it out. Neither behavior is documented, so you shouldn't rely on it for anything related to correctness. But it is probably safe to assume that the delegate passed to `Lazy&lt;T&gt;` won't be the source of memory pressure in the long-run. Others have linked the reference implementation. Here is the Core implementation: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Lazy.cs
MSDN and the F1 key are your friend (not to sound snide, but the documentation exists, and would be well worth your time to investigate). In this case, there's a number of ways to get the output to the console, but the simplest is just to loop through `blah`: var records = File.ReadLines(fileName) .Select(x =&gt; x.Split('|')) .Select(x =&gt; $"{x[1]} {x[2]}, {Regex.Replace(x[7], "\\D", "")}"); foreach (var x in records) { Console.WriteLine(x); } To *sort* it, you'd need to toss a call to some combination of `Enumerable.OrderBy()`, `Enumerable.OrderByDescending`, `Enumerable.ThenBy`, and `Enumerable.ThenByDescending` in there to specify how it should be sorted. If you're not sorting in simple ASCII order, you probably need to insert it between the first and second `Select` calls. To make everything else more readable, it might be worth using an additional `Select` to decompose the array of strings from `Split` into a tuple with named elements. But, I think I'd move the string formatting to the `Console.WriteLine()` call, at that point, just because the LINQ method chain is doing so much, then var recordsSortedByName = File.ReadLines(fileName) .Select(x =&gt; x.Split('|')) .Select(x =&gt; (lastName: x[1], firstName: x[2], scrubbedPhoneNumber: Regex.Replace(x[7], "\\D", "")) .OrderBy(x =&gt; x.lastName) .ThenBy(x =&gt; x.firstName); foreach(var x in recordsSortedByName) { Console.WriteLine($"{x.lastName} {x.FirstName}, {x.scrubbedPhoneNumber}"); }
I've had it running a while ago. Nothing makes you realize how useful a scroll wheel is until you try a text editor that doesn't support it..!
I would assume somebody did this on purpose though I don’t know why. Perhaps they are returning iqueryables and they planned to just use take(1) or first() etc as required. if they don’t return queryable then not having a better method for getting a single record will have a performance impact relative to the table size 
[I found this to be helpful - again shilling for mosh haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtXpYpZdOzM)
I remember asking the head of the CIS department about learning how to make things other than console apps and some more advanced topics. She told me their job was to provide a foundation in the basics and that the rest would come from on-the-job learning. Then I remember being really angry I went to a school that cost $20k a year to be told that, and I was only two or three semesters away from graduating before being told this.
The presence of public DbSet&lt;Product&gt; Products { get; set; } on your data context is how it knows that products are part of it's context.
There are a bizarrely large number of tutorials on the web that claim to describe the repository pattern, but do so with no understanding of its actual value, and are often disturbingly off base. Feel free to DM if you’d like to have a discussion about the pattern and it’s value. We can pare it down, and include it here after discussing a for a bit.
If someone else chose to use a repository in a very generic/CRUD way, you're better off playing by those rules. Not that having specific ways to approach data isn't helpful sometimes, but projects can become unwieldy when different developers bring their own biases in and don't adhere to a pattern. For now, you seem to be doing fine just by considering these kinds of things. Take it as a learning experience and think about how you might have done it differently. When you have free time, let those ideas out and see what other kinds of issues arise. The Repository pattern comes with a lot of trade-offs, so it definitely isn't the silver bullet solution for data access.
https://github.com/onelogin/dotnet-saml some nice suggestions at the bottom here. :)
Do you not have anyone at work to ask these questions? Not trying to flame here, just that those questions are pretty broad. As long as there isnt a ton of business logic that you will have to rewrite, MVC is just fine. As far as why you are targeting Core, do you mean ASP MVC 6? ASP MVC 5 is stable and reliable for a few years now.
&gt; C#'s System.Object was inspired by the Variant data type Variant and Object are quite different. Variant is a type that can be a container for various other supported types according to it's subtype. It's pretty much a struct/union designed to allow storing various types. Object is the root of a class heirarchy. Visual Basic provides a good means of example of the difference. in Earlier versions of Visual Basic (Pre .NET), you had the "Object" type as well as the Variant type. You could store any class instance from your project or from a referenced project or library in an Object variable, but you couldn't use it to directly hold primitive types- because with those implementations of Visual Basic, the primitive types were not Objects. However, Variant could "directly" (from the perspective of the programmer) store the primitive types because it had the needed Variant subtypes. It could store both the primitive data types as well as Objects because it had a VT_OBJECT subtype. 
Partial answer: [Don't repeat yourself!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) You can use [Constructor Chaining](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors) to separate logic which should apply to all other constructors, so you have only once *graph.ClearGraph();* 
&gt; It could store both the primitive data types as well as Objects Yep, that pretty much describes System.Object. 
You poor bastard. I'm currently in a similar predicament. See if this works for you: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.Saml/ Supports netstandard1.4
&gt; What is a web application without MVC used for No it's not the webforms of core. There's currently no such thing. It's just a set of files to serve. &gt;Are web applications without MVC still alright by today's standards MVC is just a pattern. It's technology agnostic. MVC is not a solution. Microsoft are cunning buggers and named their recent ASP.NET MVC because it follows the pattern. I'm not anti-Microsoft (except the SurfaceBook, Grrr), Java has Streams which is another general use term. So they're all at it. &gt;Is MVC good for every project No. MVC is about separation of concerns. Concerns are like job roles. You have someone in the canteen who serves the chips, they can request more chips, perhaps feedback how many chips are sold, but usually they wouldn't need to know how to cook chips. I'm hungry, it was the example that came to mind. Also, send chips. Don't examine it too deeply, just acknowledge there are roles and you need some way of mediating between them. MVC does that. &gt;Basically, how do you know when it pick an empty web application, a web application, or a web application with MVC? This is not a straightforward question. You will need a bit more experience to be able to answer this. They're all mutable if that helps. Pick the wrong one and you can turn it into one of the others. My advice would be to do a PoC with the most complicated looking one and then compare it with the other two. You'll start to see what's going on. Essentially they're opinionated. So they give you stuff in a place they think is sensible. Go for a MVC template and it will create directories for Views, et al. You also need to get a handle on the hosting. MS use IIS, more recently they support Node, but it's not ingrained and I found the MS VS experience of using Node more confusing than just doing it on the command line with a decent editor. This is really general advice, and if I saw someone else post this I could rip on bits of it. So here's my last bit of advice: Build a PoC (Proof of Concept). Start small, but tackle the big problems. By that I mean, if you know you need to do CRUD operations but some critical ones require related entities, do a PoC that DOES include related entities. If you do a PoC for the path of least resistance you will be fucked later. Final final point, /u/saddertadder said ask others. If you have a support network there, do use it. Prepare a little, this sort of thing is good, but most businesses operate on the principle that two people know more than one person. Be a little cautious, some people are just caustic, but most of the time they're good. You're feeling a bit confused, that's fine, bring the problems here. I actually like the fact you can ask a question which is basically "overwhelmed!!" without getting smacked by 30 dumbass moderators. Start with the PoC. Make the problem small. Then learn to scale. Ask questions, rely on people, then bring me cake (us cake...).
Factory pattern?
Ha actually not homework. Self taught developer and thought I would learn algorithms so I’m going through the book The Algorithm Design Manual by Steve Skiena. ADS is actually Answers to Data Structure. I then have a DS_01 that I use to practice to see if I can replicate it. I then use it for the questions in the chapter. [Here](https://github.com/jmdoescoding/tadme_steveskiena) is my github repo on my progress. 
Okay so with the factory pattern I would have the base class and all the derived classes would be the auto create graphs. And then I just pass in an int Parma of the base constructor to return the auto create graph I want? 
Okay. I was going to start doing design patterns. I feel like if an employer saw this they might look down on it because of how bad the design is. The code is I have a graph and I want a way to auto create and populate graphs so I can test algorithms. 
A repository is essentially supposed to behave like a collection
/u/GoodAndBluts 's suggestion of a Factory to "build" your graph is the best IMO https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns is an OK primer for most design patterns IMO
Because farm.Id won't be set until the data is committed. The Farm class defaults the ID to 0, until the _unitOfWork.Complete() finishes the addition of the farm object to the store of Farms. This will then generate the final and correct Id, as it's probably a unique auto-generated field.
Also, as far as an employer looking at data structure code, I dont think that will happen at all. Try to make a finished product like a sport database (very small!) like listing all NHL teams and their players and some stats. Even that is an ambitious project for new developers
It's setting userFarm.FarmId correctly because it has that relationship in the dbcontext. You are just setting the value of farm.Id to the DefaultFarmId, the dbcontext doesn't have a relationship set up for that.
As well, if you edit the user in the context of the _unitOfWork, then the relationship will be there and it would update the user.DefaultFarmId.
There should be more specific options to study. The usual computer science studies is somewhat of a spread containing something of everything, 90% utterly useless later on. If I want to become a backend developer I don't need to know all the details of a turing machine (I actually can't think of any profession besides computer science professor where this would be useful). Likewise someone that wants to get a job in IT security will not need several courses of application development but would benefit from learning a lot about low level programming.
I'm the CTO of Verismic and we are hiring developers for our Cloud Management Suite product. Its a really cool product written in c# that helps companies manage all their devices. We have remote control like teamviewer, patch management, software distribution and device inventory just to name a few of the features. We just ported our agent to .net core and added mac support and we are looking to add linux support. We want to add mobile device management support, management of IOT devices and add security software looking for suspicious processes. We use Wisej for the frontend so for the most part you don't need to know much javascript or html.
Have a look at Razor Pages. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-2.0 I haven't used it before, but from what I could gather this seems to be basically what you're looking for.
Requires: `interface IFoo : IBar, IXyzzy` is valid; though I'm uncertain about classes
It is not one or another. Using repository pattern doesn't mean that you cannot use another pattern by the side. Consider you have the repository pattern implemented. You might as well have a "service pattern" within the same solution. Now that you ask where to write the "business" code, I'm fully against doing so within a controller. I would personally implement business services that has access to the repositories. Which means your controllers interact with business services and services I'm return interact with the repositories. In case your services consist of an interface and it's implementations, you can easily access the services using dependency injection/pattern, mock and unit test them, etc. 
Good point. Thank you for your suggestions!

Thanks for the excellent response. I think what confused me the most is some of the pages I have to recreate are literally just pages with CRUD functions pointing to a table. Using MVC for that seemed like over kill because it's a single page with ~4 queries, but for all I know MVC could make it easier than how I already know how to do this. But now I see that's not really the case. For whatever reason, I was under the impression that MVC was only used for "big" projects. I think I am just gonna go the MVC route with. Worst case scenario is I learn something new. I hope you got some food!
&gt; Do you not have anyone at work to ask these questions? Not trying to flame here, just that those questions are pretty broad. I do, but I was hoping I would be able to google my way out of it. I even made 3 sites as a test and still didn't have an answer. I didn't want to wait until Monday. I guess my confusion came from me thinking MVC = big sites only and I don't know where I got that from...
Razor pages seem pretty cool, thanks!
I believe the edition you were seeing was the upcoming 2nd edition. The original edition is available here: Exam Ref 70-483 Programming in C# (MCSD) https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735676828/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_LH6.Ab13WAKMY
You'll be fine, it actually works well for small projects. It feels like a lot of boilerplate and repetition, but you learn how to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) with a bit of practice :) I was well fooded :)
Is this threaded?
Easiest explanation would be that you maybe have a race condition going on. Maybe you have an "await" or "yield return" somewhere in your method? That could definitely reveal race conditions easily. - Is the object modified somewhere else as well? - What are the values you are getting? - Do you have yield return or await in your method? In any case, more information is needed about the function and what positions ***exactly*** are seemingly changing the behavior, and what the results of the evaluations are at that point in time. Add tons of Debug.Write, Console.Log, or whatever is easiest for you to your code and then tell us the results. Maybe its something easy and straightforward, or maybe its a much deeper issue. Anyway we can only ever hope to figure out with a ton more info about what is even going on here. 
&gt; What is the point of using generics if you are absolutely doing nothing with it? You won’t have any type constraints. You wouldn’t need to get the type of “T.” Your method doesn’t need to return a type based on the input type. &gt; &gt;If I was code reviewing a generic method that only used the input’s ToString(), or GetHashCode(), had no type constraints, and wasn’t using the generic type in any way, I would reject that submission honestly. Nitpick incoming... generics are very important for some performance-sensitive routines that can't afford boxing / unboxing value-types.
"restrain parameters to constants within a class" -- I can't think of a case when I'd want to use something like this and I wouldn't rather have it be an enum. What can this idea do that's meaningfully less straightforward than using an enum?
I do not know. I'm using .NET MVC

The video link to (mosh) is wrong. He advises a generic repo which is wrong on its face. Purpose of repository is to ENCAPSULATE business logic not leave it hanging out all over the UI layer. Never put business logic in a controller. Tip: use Entity Framework an save yourself the pain of writing the data access layer. // Service - Goes in MyProject.Services public class ProductService { private ProductDataAccess da; public ProductService(ProductDataAccess da) { this.da = da; // better: inject EF DbContext here instead } public void AddProduct(Product product) { // validation here da.AddProduct(product); } public void DeleteProduct(int id) { da.DeleteProduct(id); } public Product GetProductByID(int id) { da.GetProduct(id); } public List&lt;Product&gt; GetProducts(string description, string vendor) { // Query logic belongs here not in UI layer } } // DataAccess - Goes in MyProject.DataAccess public class ProductDataAccess { private string connectionString; public ProductDataAccess(string connectionString) { this.connectionString = connectionString; } public Product GetProduct(int id) { using(sqlConnection con = new SqlConnectin(connectionString))... using(sqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(con))... using(DataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()... Product p = new Product { ID = reader["ID"], Description = reader["Description") }; return p; } } // Model - goes in MyProject.Model public class Product { public int ID {get;set;} public string Description {get;set;} // more properties }
Newtonsoft should automatically escape things for you when it does serialize/deserialize. Strings being members of a JSON object is a common scenario.
Quote characters are escaped. See this for more information: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15637429/how-to-escape-double-quotes-in-json It is possible to change the quote char, but that will make your JSON incompatible by default with third party producers and consumers.
That would no longer be JSON. Newtonsoft.Json already handles the case where a string value contains quotation marks, you don’t have to do anything special.
You are right about not putting BL in controllers. The best place for it, however, is a class library where it can be reused.
Dont care about third party, its just for my program. So how do i change it?
Why even use Json.NET then if you’re not going to be working with Json? Either write your own parser for a custom format you’ve created or stick to the Json spec and use Json.NET. 
This is one of the better videos I've seen about the Repository pattern, however it has a huge issue in my opinion. He is right about the part that the repository should always return an IEnumerable, but when he accepts Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; predicate in his Find method, everything goes to hell. 
What are you actually trying to achieve with your program? As other people have pointed out, Newtonsoft.Json already has quote escaping and changing the quote character is bad for other reasons - it's no longer valid JSON, and what happens when a user wants to include the string "|.|" in the string you're storing? If you give a little more information about the problem you're trying to solve, it might be possible to avoid this specific technical issue entirely.
First it would be \", not //". Second the user doesn't enter that. They enter ". Newtonsoft handles making that \" in the json document. First step is just trying something to see if it works out of the box 🙂. Second step is trying to fix it if it doesn't. Otherwise you end up trying to fix something in a non obvious way when it actually didn't need fixing.
The user is editing the json document itself thru a textbox, so there is nothing for json to handle
Because why would i write a custom parser
Well id just make them not enter |.|, simple. And the user edits the json file itself so they have to type //" instead of " which is garbage
Okay, why do they have to edit the JSON file directly? Why not have controls for the properties of the data structure you're storing and then serialize that?
Just answer my damn original question on how to change it, nobody yet has, so i am infact still using json (until someone answers my damn question already)
James (the guy who created Json.net) had a joke project that used the library to serialise to DSON (Doge Serialized Object Notation) https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Dson It might not be trivial, but that may help you get started (otherwise, wouldn't a simple string replace or regex work?) 
And how exactly am i "shitting on everyone"
JsonTextWriter does not have a quote char property, at least not a public one it seems.
Seems i need an instance, yet how do i tell json to use that instead of its default # JsonTextWriter
And i did search before asking on reddit
And i also need to set quote char of JsonTextReader, so how do i make an instance of the reader and the writer and tell json to use them
Seems json is also on github so ill try editing that instead of dson
I shouldn't have snapped, I apologise for that, my bad. However, the people who have tried to answer your question are trying to get you to think about your problem in a different way so that you can avoid reinventing the wheel, which can often seem tempting but usually isn't actually necessary without a strong reason to. To answer your specific question, I don't think you can make the ``JsonConvert`` utility methods actually use your own ``JsonTextWriter``, you'll have to manually instantiate one using a ``TextWriter`` when you need to write text to a string or file, and use the ``JsonTextReader`` when you need to do the opposite.
``internal protected`` means that only code within the same assembly (Newtonsoft.Json.dll) or classes that inherit ``JsonTextWriter`` can access it. You'll have to write your own class that changes this value.
Bro, chill. You're doing something silly and people are telling you that you're doing something silly meanwhile you're 100% convinced you're not doing something silly. If a user is editing JSON directly, seeing | instead of " will be off-putting and confusing. Additionally what if | is a perfectly valid character in the text I'm entering? The questions you need to figure are why is the user editing JSON directly and what can you do to provide a better interface for that. 
This is a great point that I honestly forget about. I doubt that this is what mr anti-object was going for, ha, but it is good to know. I’m curious: do you have an example of where an optimization like this has mattered? I’m usually a bit of a performance guy myself, but I don’t know if I’ve ever felt like I’ve needed to consider something like the effects of boxing into what I’m doing.
&gt;I’m curious: do you have an example of where an optimization like this has mattered? I’m usually a bit of a performance guy myself, but I don’t know if I’ve ever felt like I’ve needed to consider something like the effects of boxing into what I’m doing. When you run a million or so coordinate transformations (e.g., get a point on the screen that represents that location on the surface of the spherical Earth), there's a big difference between allocating an object on the heap for the result vs. something that passes the result on the stack. Even then, often, especially with server garbage collection enabled, this is not going to be noticeable, except when it turns out that garbage collection is competing with other transformations you want to run in parallel. Even more than that, though, I'm grateful that `System.Collections.Generic` is able to work like this :-)
been waiting like a year for my Manning Akka.Net book -___-
When will this be on YouTube?
Thats why i want |.| rather than just | and its what i used in my examples. The json thing is because i dont want to provide a proper control for each data type as its too much work.
The solution is to make a control for each of the data types but its easier to edit them in json text than to make it as its too much work. So thats why i just want an answer to my question instead of alternatives
Change your program, not the standard. You’re only setting yourself up for a refactor. 
All serializers have to escape " characters or else you will end up with malformed json. What I'm saying is, there has to be some way for the serialiser to tell the difference between a quotation mark that's part of the json structure and a quotation mark that's part of the content. If you use that same rule to locate the correct " characters then you can just use a plain string replace 
You are still talking about the solution you have in mind, not the actual goal. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that instead of this: { "someProperty": "some text", "anotherProperty": "text with \"quotations\" in it" } ...you want something like this? { |.|someProperty|.|: |.|some text|.|, |.|anotherProperty|.|: |.|text with "quotations" in it|.| } Now I'd prefer to never have to edit JSON by hand but if it came down to it I would like to use the first formatting style every time. I'm sure that whoever is doing the editing can handle escaping their `"`. You're inventing a problem where there isn't one.
This is just the token, not the protocol, I've tried it and it doesn't work.
You could make a get only property that returns the date diffs on the entity class and configure it to be ignored by entity framework. 
IMO entity models should be [naked objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects), because i believe there should be a clear separation between logic and data. This keeps in line with domain driven design, where all business logic is contained in domain objects or services. This allows you to add additional business logic and structure without impacting the database structure unless your explicitly express it. On to the question though. I'm not sure what level you're at with entity framework, so my apologies and disregard if you've heard this before and have differening opinions. As we know, Entity framework (tries) to intelligently create an sql statement based on your lambda or usage of the object / list. if your lamdba filtering contains a method that it can't parse into sql, it will throw an EF parse error. Since your property is parseable, it turns into an sql. But think about it: SuspendTime is deep within Description in the MarketCatalogue, which is a join on a join. Not pretty at all. I could go on how you can make that data easier to access, but i digress. youre issue is the fact that we've got extra sql in the statement we want in the app layer. The simple solution is to create a domain model that contains IsMarketClosed. create a copy of your entity model into a separate domain model folder (of similar structure) named "MarketCatalogueModel", and in your "getMarkets" method, simply add a "select(i =&gt; new MarketCatalogueModel{id = i.id})" before the execution command "ToList()" (or whatever you used). The magical thing about the "select" lambda is that EF only fetches fields you explicitly tell it to fetch. In my above example, the SQL would only contain a single ID field, even though your entity model contains dozens more fields! This give you 2 things: 1) significant performance improvement, 2) full control over what data is pulled from your entity model, 3) eliminates the need for multiple entity models that contain various groups of fields 4) allows you to freely develop business models, while keeping entity models tightly controlled. 
You can do this by returning and expression instead of bool. Change your IsMarketClosed property to the following: public virtual Expressions\&lt;Func\&lt; MarketCatalogue, bool\&gt;\&gt; IsMarketClosed =\&gt; catalogue =\&gt; catalogue.MarketClosedUtcTime \&lt; DateTime.UtcNow; 
Hello, thank you, no you understand. I could do that, and I had thought of it \(but havent tried it yet\). It's just that I am looking for a solution that works in more complicated situations \(as well as this one\). 
Thank you. You are correct that would work in this instance. I suppose I am thinking of more complicated situations and how one would solve those in terms of general overall design goals. I guess I am wondering whether this code first thing is all its cracked up to be as opposed to using stored proceders \(at the moment it seems easier to apply DRY that way\)...
Hmm, thats interesting. I can see that being useful for many things. I prefer to have less dependencies if I can. Will read through and try digest it tho. Thank you kindly. 
I've working with it from both sides, and I personally prefer code first. If you have a more complex situation I would turn to a service pattern where the shared code can live.
Hi thestamp, I sort of understand what you say about the domain model At the moment I dont have a Domain layer. I have a bunch of static data access methods that return the data as IEnumerable/IList \(or whatever is required\). I'll have to digest it, but I think I see how it can help with the DRY thing. Will need time to think about this.... I still have a lot to learn. I am also fairly new on Reddit, I hope it's OK to digress because this interest me; &gt; But think about it: SuspendTime is deep within Description in the MarketCatalogue, which is a join on a join. Not pretty at all. I could go on how you can make that data easier to access, How would you suggest is a good way to avoid the joins? Thank you heaps for your advice, really appreciate it.
Ahh ic, that looks promising. I shall give it a try. Thank you, good tip.
Tell us more about the problem, and the technology you're using. Most programmers want no part in creating future maintenance problems or a poor user experience which is the direction this is going. There's probably another solution you haven't thought of that's easier than writing controls for everything and works better than your idea.
&gt; Purpose of repository is to ENCAPSULATE business logic No, that's the job of the service/business layer. Repositories are data access not business layer.
This makes the video literally useless.
The content on Pluralsight for C# is excellent.
&gt; but when he accepts Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; predicate What I was mentioning also. 
&gt; build one with the strategy pattern. Interesting... do you mind mocking up a few lines of psudo code to show what that would look like?
Don’t have this issue myself but I guess if I had a setup like yours I might consider creating a local solution file for all the projects and not include in source control 
you can use a Task. e.g. public async Task&lt;T&gt; Test() { // stuff you want to do before response Task.Run(() =&gt; { // stuff you want to do after response }); return T; } 
Do you control the code calling the endpoint?
Not sure exactly what you're asking, but you could just await another task: public async Task Test() { await HttpContext.Response.WriteAsync("My response"); await ExtraCode(); } private Task ExtraCode() { // Extra code here that runs after the client receives the response }

Does it need to run exactly after or anytime after?
Exactly after
I think you need to write a middleware that has the "extra" stuff run after calling the rest of the middleware chain. There is a [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40604609/net-core-endrequest-middleware?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) about this.
Why not just kick off an async process, then return the result without awaiting? Is the timing required so tight that you need to be absolutely sure the response is gone before starting. If it really is, then I think it is outside the responsibility of a controller. I would treat them as domain events and set up some middleware to dispatch those events to handlers after returning a response. 
Thanks for the reply. I tried the following code in my Configure method of my Startup clas: app.Use(async (httpContext, next) =&gt; { if (next != null) await next(); if (httpContext.Request.Path == "/test") { } }); I set a breakpoint at the second-to-last } When I visited /test, the tab hung until I pressed the Continue button in the debugger. I need my extra code to be executed after the response has been delivered. Do you know how I can run code after the middleware chain has concluded and the response has been delivered?
I don’t believe there is an step on the controller lifecycle to do that. Writing a middleware and placing it after the action execution would required you to “return” from your action and if I’m not mistaken wouldn’t send the complete response to the client until all middlewares in the pipeline executed. I would consider sending a message to a queue with all required data a processing it separately.
I think /u/Telexen1 is correct and maybe you can't actually do this. AFAIK the response is sent only after the pipeline ends, so there really doesn't exist a concept of anything after the response is emitted. I'm kinda curious what you application requirement could possibly be that needs such a mechanism. There may be a different architectural piece you need.
There is no guarantee that the asynchronous process will complete its execution before the controller and all dependencies are disposed. For instance: if the action return the db connection might be disposed and will not be available for the asynchronous function. There is also the problem of having the webserver ending the request/response thread before the asynchronous task completes. 
I'm making an endpoint for use in Nightbot commands. Nightbot is a Twitch chat bot. When a Nightbot command visits a URL, it sends a header called Nightbot-Response-Url, which contains a response link where messages can be sent with a POST request. Nightbot commands normally only result in the bot sending a single message in reply. But if a command includes an instruction to visit my URL with up to 6 specified messages, my endpoint can send 1 message as the request's response, and then up to 5 additional messages by using the link contained in Nightbot-Response-Url. I need to preserve order so that message 1 (the message that is sent as the response) is always sent before messages 2-6 (sent using the link). Does ASP.NET Core MVC really have no way to invoke code after the request pipeline has finished? That seems like a very basic feature.
Do you know how can I ensure that the queue item is only processed once the request has concluded and the response has been sent to the client?
Does express wait for a response? I thought send() just sends the response(intellisense has never told me to await it either so it's not an async method, I can't test right now). In that case you would have the same race condition either way. Are you waiting for something stupidly slow for those other requests or delaying them in a factor if seconds? Because it your sending the rest of the requests off by the time they get to the client there's no guarantee that they arrived to each client sequentially.
why not udemy
It sounds like this isn't possible using ASP.NET Core MVC. But this is possible using Express with Node.js (see example in main post), so perhaps there is some framework/pattern in the .NET Core universe that can accommodate my use case of running code after a response has been sent. Do you know of any such framework/pattern?
Don't use udemy because it costs, and there are way better resources on youtube and on google in general. [Brackeys C# course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSiIHe2uZ2w&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR6ZkG8gZwJYSjnXxmfPAl51) is what I used to learn, which gives you the fundamentals of C# which then can be used in unity which is a great program to continue on after which he also has a playlist on about creating your first video game which I highly recommend completing [Brackeys Unity course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL). Not only this but he also has a forum with lots of people who are willing to help you learn [Brackeys fourm](http://forum.brackeys.com/). Lastly there is also a few discord servers which I have found useful! C# Discord [https://discord.gg/FTqNnyS](https://discord.gg/FTqNnyS) full of talented programmers and the Game Dev League which has a lot of Game programs who use C# and Unity on the daily . [https://discord.gg/0TYNJfCU4De7YIk8](https://discord.gg/0TYNJfCU4De7YIk8) There is way more support at these links then you will ever get at udemy remember it's all only a money making scam.

&gt;Does ASP.NET Core MVC really have no way to invoke code after the request pipeline has finished? That seems like a very basic feature. I've written a lot of web applications and typically there's a problem with my design when I need to do follow up work. The process you are modeling seems to be one not typically solved by web applications, but more of a web workflow in which other technologies such as queues are involved. In a situation like you've described, depending on where your endpoint is hosted, you have a lot of choices. For example, If you were in AWS, you could use a message queue(AWS IOT or DynamoDB Streams) and lambda to deal with your requirements. AWS has two other queues(SNS and SQS) but they don't interact well with Lambda. From the initial request, if you know of the 5 subsequent messages you'd like to push, you could place those on the queue and then send your response to the user. The second half of the solution is the lamda function. It can be triggered by AWS IOT or DynamoDB Streams to process the messages you posted on to the queue. Azure has its equivalent solution as well. If your executing environment is windows or linux, then you could run rabbitMQ and create a standalone consumer to pull your messages off the queue. Kafka is another solution for a queue but it does not guarantee order. Either way, both queues provide different ways of retaining your messages in case of failure, so if you go down the queuing path, make sure to take that into consideration. 
im avoiding stack overflow for now because i get flamed when i ask a noob question it took me 2 days to figure out that my 12 lines of code wasnt working because of the syntax error was \( and my if statements dont use ; i found out ive been following some bad tutorials because i was told after every line always put a ; but was never told that doesnt apply to if statements they i found a few good tutorials that just stop where 3rd video they never uploaded or finish again its like im contently picking it up and having to restart somewhere ive come to learn that googling is a skill for programing because half the time im not sure what im looking for when i am lost and i end up leaving with more questions rather then a answer example when i tried looking up my exact syntax error it ended up taking me to several things about procedures which i didnt know what that was and boolen which had nothing to do with why i was getting that on my if statements \(clearly\) i wasnt looking correctly but ive only been trying to learn c# for about a week so what id prefer to start me off is to get a linear tutorial from start to finish just to get the basics and fundementals down before i start moving foward with the language i know it doesnt help to start learning procedures for example if i dont know what a variable is which i do know what a variable is i was using that a a example 
This is a good solution OP.
I found a solution by using HttpContext.Response.OnCompleted
Dig deep enough into the ControllerContext and find the actual socket used for sending the bytes. Once that closes you are good to go. Maybe, I haven't tried. 
If you want to guarantee order, consider putting the initial message on the queue, so instead of one response and 5 messages, put 6 messages on the queue. With just one consumer, you'll get your messages sent in order.
Don't avoid Stackoverflow, it's the best resource out. If I where you check out the C# course I gave you. If you don't understand something search it up and then continue once you know. Programming is like learning a new language it will take you sometime. I learn't c# fundamentals within 1 day because of how similar it is to other languages. So you need to take time in it, if you have issues with code reach out to the c# community on discord, see if they can help you. But don't let it be spoon-fed to you. If you seem to have issues picking up the language, try Python it's easy for beginners yet powerful. I started with C++ moved to Python then JavaScript then C#
Agreed!
They way I work with so many instances open is to just put them on different virtual desktops, and that way I know where each one is, and just swap the desktops, using Ctrl-Win-Arrow keys. 
How about multiple *Task Views / Virtual Desktops*? If you are using Windows 10 there are built in, otherwise you can download e.g. **Dexpot**. Here is an article on how to change the wallpaper so each View has a different one. This will make it easier to select the VS you want....

You can do most things with Dexpot! [https://www.dexpot.de/](https://www.dexpot.de/) Disclaimer! I have no connection either to Microsoft or to Dexpot! Just a user...
Hangfire, or Web Jobs. Basic concept is a separate service (running in the same Azure Web App) that can handle background processing. Especially useful in cases where the task may take 500ms or even multiple seconds to execute and you don't need it done prior to returning from the controller method.
Hangfire is also our go-to for things like this where we need to return quickly (keeps the UI quick), but then handle something in a background fashion. Hard bits that we've learned: - Pass only IDs and integer/enums/strings into the Hangfire method. Passing full objects gets you in trouble, really quickly. - Make your methods smart enough not to do work if there is no work to be done (or it's already done), or function in a way that they do no harm. - Never eat exceptions inside the method. 
Upvoted for the update that provided a solution. I don’t think I’ll ever find myself in the same situation, but it is MVPs like you, who post the solution to their problem once they find it, that make research into problems that much easier. Kudos.
It may help if you explain **why** and **what** you want to do. This could be a case of an XY question.
I would have proposed [QueueBackgroundWorkItem] (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2014/06/04/queuebackgroundworkitem-to-reliably-schedule-and-run-background-processes-in-asp-net/) but it's not available on aspnet core 2 and [it's implementation have been rescheduled for 3.0](https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting/issues/1280)
I am afraid styles are too static for this problem. Currently i am generating a set of colors depending on the item count in my collection. The collection can change during runtime and so do the colors. I could use a "ColorFactory" disguised as a custom ResourceDictionary, but i think there is a better way to do this. I will look into CollectionViews for that matter as well.
&gt; WPF themes i did not know this was a thing and will have a look into it. I'll read the documentation later as well.
I used in the past an extension that would allow changing the title of visual studio to a smaller part of the solution name. It was quite some time ago and it was for VS2013 or 15. Don't remember the name though. A quick search might find it if it exists 
Yes, a theme is basically just a xaml file of styles for all the provided controls and associating them with the app, which is the top level object. The documentation link I provided explains how it works out which style to use :) [didn't read all this, but it seems reasonable for themes info](http://michaelscodingspot.com/2017/06/30/wpf-complete-guide-themes-skins/) 
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mayerwin.RenameVisualStudioWindowTitle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mayerwin.RenameVisualStudioWindowTitle)
Yes, I think that was it! Thanks! 
[There's a free video course](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949) directly from Microsoft that should be of some help.
It's my understanding that once you send the response, the ASP.NET Request Context will be disposed, but I can't find any docs on this. What I would do is have a thread that you initialize in startup, and have this thread dedicated to "jobs". Have it await a cancellation token that you can set from your action. This allows the thread to idle without wasting CPU cycles, as it would if you implemented a polling system. This token signals the thread that it needs to do some work. This work will be whatever you're wanting to do after sending the response. It may be helpful to write some info to a database which would contain some instructions for this thread. So in summary: 1) In startup, initialize a thread dedicated to job processing 2) Have this thread await a cancellation token 3) In the action, just before you send your response, commit a "job" to the DB 4) Signal the job thread to continue 5) Send response 6) Job thread wakes up, sees the job in the DB, and processes it 7) Check for another job, and if there aren't any, go back to awaiting the token Rather than using a cancellation token, you could use a manual reset event or something similar. Alternatively, you may be able to use something like hangfire, but I'm not really familiar with it. The system I suggested in this post is strikingly similar to one I developed to send emails whilst complying with AWS SES rate limiting, and I think it works pretty well and is fairly easy to set up, and light-weight.
I was told to create the function of those. But to get the overall min and overall max is my problem. Perhaps I should store the min's in a min array and the max's in a max array. Sort that and then return the highest and lowest?
Just watch Venkat's C# series for beginners on YouTube. It's a great start. Then after that, he has lots of videos on MVC, SQL Server and other related technologies.
Wow, I hope you are banned for your horrible behaviour in this sub.
If the output is a single min and a single max (though there is an edge case of n people with the same min/max) then just iterate over all of the array lists with a variable scoped above the loops. At each element compare to the current global min max and if it’s less than it greater than you store the new global min max in the higher scoped variable. 
Pro tip: Don't use ArrayList. Use List&lt;T&gt;.
how much would I need to change in the code to implement a list?
Great idea, thanks. I have been trying to use virtual desktops.
You only need to store the highest and lowest so far. 
 var minVal = int.MaxValue; // int for example var maxVal = int.MinValue; foreach (var current in someArray) { minVal = Math.Min(current, minVal); maxVal = Math.Max(current, maxVal); } You could put this in a function to return a tuple or class of min/max I guess, then call it for each array, do the same Math.Min/Max on each min/max value. 
Yes. ArrayList is a remnant of the time C# didn't have generics. There is absolutely no reason to use them for new code.
I'm guessing given that this is a homework assignment this is yet another prime example of poor teaching from the teachers who "learnt" C# 1.0 and then decided to henceforth never ever learn anything new.
Yeah. Good thing the language hasn't changed much since 1.0...
On phone hard to check but I believe there is a response.flush that starts sending anything that was already written 
Create c:\dev and put local solution files in there with descriptive names. Use different virtual desktops for each of the projects.
If I have my *ArrayList* in the class *Student* would I need to make my object in *main* as *List\&lt;Student\&gt;*?
Not at all, arrays are fine. It's just ArrayList that is obsolete.
First I want to get good at C sharp and good at programming afterwards I want to attempt to program games I have 3K saved up so I can hire and pay freelancing sprite artist to design me some Sprites I do it myself but I can't draw for shit like I'm not one of those people who just saying it like I literally can't draw for s*** I can barely write I have dysgraphia
That's part of the self teaching process. I spent 16 hours trying to figure out what was wrong with a line of code. I didn't understand the error and the explanations were too technical. It was missing a (). Moral of the story is stupid mistakes happen while you are wrapping your head around syntax.
On the bright side though it was good that I did go to stack overflow even though I got down voted inflamed It's because I didn't know the basics of the fundamentals when I thought I did putting a semicolon when I wasn't supposed to I was only folloqing what the tutorial told me to do Then I tried to do the if statement on my own 
Makes sense, the curriculums haven't changed at all in the last 20 years.
Exactly! A kid born at the same time as 1.0 can't even vote yet!
Yeah I didn't even paste in unit tests. Shame on me. 
TIL following common sense is "Enterprise".
yeah, I hate the way they keep changing the cover of the books and nothing else. like oh, it's c# 2 now! Suckaz. yeah OK. (Looking at YOU Jon Skeet!)
So... what is the correct minimum/maximum for an empty array?
Yeah there's no reason to store more than one value for each. Just keep updating a min and max variable whenever you find a number that's lower/higher.
So I done a quick refactor of your posted code - I didn't realise that dotnetfiddle only compiles to v4.5 and so I couldn't link that for you but if you copy&amp;paste this into VS and target v4.6.1+ then youll have no problem! https://pastecode.xyz/view/a2e3fb8b *this is by no means perfect but it is somewhat of an improvement* Like other people have said the only real glaring thing was the ArrayList, it is much better to be using List&lt;T&gt; or even T[] Also look into linq extension methods (I left examples in my posted code)
Don't sort to get the highest/lowest. It's unnecessary. At the very most you should iterate through the list once and keep track of the highest/lowest value you've seen. But there's an easier way! Track the highest/lowest grade every time you add. So you have a private member highest/lowest in Student and every time you add you compare to this stored highest/lowest value. That way the GetMin/GetMax routines simply return this value and you don't need to waste time sorting or even iterating through the list.
Dude, it's example code on the internet. Calm down. It's not meant to be complete but show how to solve the problem.
I use a try-catch-finally block for this.
Thanks much for the reply. I might just do dt.[ReadXml | WriteXml](filename.xml).
What you might want is `IEntityTypeConfiguration`. It allows you to configure an entity type for the DbContext without having to put that configuration in the DbContext itself, or even in the same assembly. You simply apply them from OnModelCreating. How you access them from there is up to you — you can scan all loaded assemblies for implementations and get them that way, but a better choice will probably be to register them as services and let the DbContext receive them via dependency injection.
You *could* try learning how to work with Unity while you learn C#. Unity uses C# for its own scripting, so you'll be killing two birds with one stone, especially if you start with the "Roll a Ball" and "Space Shooter" tutorials. The C# scripts used in the tutorials aren't too complex, and even though they don't really cover programming basics and best practices in general you'll still find the very useful. 
I tried udemy by buying one of their beginner Android courses prior to taking my Mobile App Development course the semester before last. I didn't finish the udemy course because *they were teaching wrong things*. Literally, not teaching it right from the word "go". No, Mr. Udemy Android Instructor, you in fact *do not* hardcode your strings into the Activity, you *do* use fragments so why not teach them, and you in fact *do* need to work with the .xml layout files. Geessh. Good thing it was on sale... 
As for not being able to draw due to dysgraphia, *get Adobe Illustrator*. You *will* be able to design your own sprites. 
Guess I just have to go old skool on this: READ: DataSet ds = new DataSet(); DataTable dt = new DataTable(); try { if (File.Exists("dt.xml")) { ds.ReadXml("ds.xml"); dt = ds.Tables[0]; } }catch(Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); } WRITE: try { //test datatable save DataSet ds = new DataSet(); DataTable dt = new DataTable("tblRssFeeds"); dt.Columns.Add("Title"); dt.Columns.Add("Link"); DataRow dr = dt.NewRow(); dr["Title"] = "CNN"; dr["Link"] = "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss"; dt.Rows.Add(dr); dr = dt.NewRow(); dr["Title"] = "Google"; dr["Link"] = "https://news.google.com/news/rss/?ned=us&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en"; dt.Rows.Add(dr); ds.Tables.Add(dt); //Properties.Settings.Default.rssFeedsDT = dt; //Properties.Settings.Default.Save(); ds.WriteXml("ds.xml"); } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); }
Looks like nested loops...
How so?
so basically it was a scam 
This is true of most developers. The reason behind lessons like this in university are to gain an understanding of how an implementation of `Min()` may work in any language so it may be applied scientifically for designing high performing algorithms. Most developers either never do this in practice at employment or never go into research for computer science. This is not to say you should limit your understanding of the language or frameworks you work in. There are definite advantages to understanding the why you should or not use a certain built in method or sometimes how it works. You probably will never need to learn how `List`s are implemented in .NET. However, there are some concepts that are pivotal to understanding how .NET works. Garbage collection and asynchronous functions are good examples. Understanding how LINQ works can also reduce complicated queries. TLDR; It won't change because you work on complex things, but because you choose to learn it. :)
What does that mean. I am new here sorry.
"Do My HomeWork PLeaSe"
Um, no, it's not the same at all. Have you heard of plagiarism?
Probably because at least one path in your code does not return a value.
how many paths have to return a value?
I understand what you are saying, and you're definitely not wrong. I can assure you that my code either has &lt;10% plagiarism. In fact here is a link of my current code: https://dotnetfiddle.net/n1Qy3H Maybe check for the plagiarism yourself. Also take into consideration that there are probably multiple different sites that will pop up due to similar sections of code being posted by different people. So, that kinda makes it useless to do a plagiarism check on code.
If you have visual studio (community edition is free) you can just start a new asp net core project. If you don’t want front end JavaScript you can select the base mvc in the new project wizard. That should get you a working website. You could use razor as the view engine to build the tables with for/for each loops. 
All of them, as the error message says.
I will put a disclaimer in the future, so I do apologize for not having that in the first place. I am sorry if any of my replies came in an offensive manner. I have seen people get bashed for put homework up when they were asking for an alternative function, library, ... etc So, I apologize for taking your comment in an offensive light as well. I should have read it from a more logical stand point. Thanks for the advice!
Your function returns 'Användare' but according to the logic if 'loginEllerSkapa' isn't "l" or "s" then then 'Användare' never gets set. 
1. Kod bör i allmänhet skrivas på engelska, det blir sjukt mycket enklare och konsistent, även om kommentarer kan vara i andra språk 2. You really want to avoid GOTO statements at all cost. They break the flow of logic and make it a lot harder to understand whats going on. 3. The code inside ``public Användare NuKörVi()`` should be indented another step. 4. Now, to answer your question. By writing ``public Användare NuKörVi()`` you say that ``NuKörVi()`` should return an användare everytime you call it, but you don't. If the first if statement succeed but the second ``if användare != null`` fails, you don't return anything at all. ``` if(loginEllerSkapa == "l") { Console.Write("Användarnamn: "); string användarnamn = Console.ReadLine(); Console.Write("Lösenord: "); string lösenord = Console.ReadLine(); Användare användare = infoBank.Find(i =&gt; i.Användarnamn == användarnamn &amp;&amp; i.Lösenord == lösenord); if(användare != null) //WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS FAILS? { Console.Clear(); Console.WriteLine("Välkommen, du är inloggad som {0}", användarnamn); return användare; } //DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS else {return null} } ``` You never return anything in this path either: ``` else if(loginEllerSkapa == "s") { ... } ``` &amp;nbsp; If you don't plan to do anything at all with the användare you return you should just write the function as ``public void NuKörVi()``, in which case you won't have to ever return anything in any of the paths. 
That makes sense. Thanks.
Hey, this may sound really weird, but I would love to like...teach you an intro course. I know intro c#pretty good, and I remember my first time trying to learn programming. Everyone was rude and had a weird god complex thing going on. Anyways I’d love to start with just a simple console application that you can you can send replies and stuff too. We can network through discord. Since I can screen share. I also have a best friend who is a full time c# programmer who helps me when I ask. I’ll send you a PM for the link. Unfortunately, I work very odd hours and strange days, but I can help from my phone if needed! 
Razor Pages is an easy place to start on ASP .Net Core. Less learning than MVC if you just need to display some tables.
This is what I have so far. I am not sure if my looping is correct though, since the amount of students are user defined and there are 5 grades, this then affects the amount of stars written for the grade range. for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i += 10) { Console.Write(i + " - " + (i + 9) + ": "); for (int j = 0; j &lt; (n*5); j++) { if (students[i].getGrades() &lt;= 9) { Console.Write("*"); } } } In the student class I have created a getGrades function to get each of the values in *List\&lt;double\&gt; grades*: public double getGrades() { double grade = 0.0; foreach (var item in grades) { grade = item; } return grade; } Though my method of approaching this whole task is probably wrong.
Isn't razor page an MVC thing?
First big question to help you: How much do you want to learn to achieve your goal? It's not a complicated task, but if you have no intention on learning CSS or Javascript, I'm not sure this is the project for you. I dont mean to sound rude so please dont take it as such. But you're going to have to do a bit more than CSS or Javascript. And I ask so we can help you achieve this within a reasonable scope for what you want to do and learn!
A cshtml file that uses Razor is the same in both and the same project type can host both. Razor Pages is the name of a new routing system in which you don't use Controllers and instead have a Razor Page with a backing PageModel that uses an MVVM binding construct. The routing is as simple as a folder named Pages. Inside pages is all of your views with backing view models. Routing works on the file structure so Pages/index.cshtml is your main page and so forth. I know the name is confusing as people have always used the term razor page to describe a cshtml with Razor.
First I just cannot have node.js on machine running my small kestrel serves so any node.js magic should be either on dev machine only or preferably not there at all. I know that I can build unstyled html tables and switch between them when clicking on hrefs but that part where I have to style them is killing me. I just think that there should be some project or component that just visualizes data using not too ugly tables. If I have to spend a day just to style the table cell or if I have to run node.js with 100Mb of stuff then it is just a non-starter for me. 
Why don't you just use a CSS framework? [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a hugely popular one, but if you're pressed for resources something like [PureCSS would also do the job.](https://purecss.io) I'd say that Bootstrap is definitely easier to get started with if you have no wish to work with CSS.
Bootstrap is too steep for me. PureCSS looks nice. I also just found this: https://www.datatables.net/ Could be the answer I was looking for. I have no problems building Web API and working with data but UI is killing me.
Small project? No JavaScript? How about Blazor :^)
Something like this you'd just have to account for the absence of grades: var students = new List&lt;Student&gt; { new Student { Grades = new List&lt;int&gt; { 75, 89, 92 } }, new Student { Grades = new List&lt;int&gt; { 33, 44, 100, 99} } }; var groupedGrades = students .SelectMany(s =&gt; s.Grades) .GroupBy(g =&gt; g / 10) .Select(g =&gt; new { Index = g.Key, Count = g.Count() }); foreach(var group in groupedGrades.OrderBy(g =&gt; g.Index)) { string gradeRange = group.Index == 10 ? "100" : $"{group.Index}0 - {group.Index}9"; Console.WriteLine($"{gradeRange}: {new string('*', group.Count)}"); }
That is hardcore.
&gt;I didn't start off with unity because I wasn't sure if Unity covers a full understanding of C sharp which is what I want You'll never really get to a "full" understanding of C#. You may come to know a language really intimately, but there's no such thing as truly mastering a language. New languages and flavours pop up all the time, standards change, libraries come and go. The neat thing about programming is that there's *always* something new to learn. Your logic isn't unsound though, take your time to learn about classes, interfaces, inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, object orientation, libraries, extensions, what have you. Then once you get comfortable with the basics, don't be afraid of branching out and trying the waters in Unity. The worst thing you can do is let a fear of failure stop you.
That's fair. I'd recommend that you familiarise yourself at least a bit with CSS. It's really not all that complex. It can be a bit finicky, but that's also where frameworks come in and save the day. Flexbox is really easy to work with \([I whipped this thing up in about 20 minutes](https://i.imgur.com/N3HTQPP.png)\) and the new [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) looks *real* nice. Once you start foraying into SASS and the like things get **mighty** fun. Granted, I understand wanting to focus on one thing at a time. Just don't limit yourself because something looks a bit scary. :\)
What is the desired path? Doesn't seem as intuitive as the Java path I followed. 
Who's talking about Node?
I understand that, though that kind of mindset might hinder you more than it'll help. People are quick to claim that X will kill Y and so forth, but reality is usually quite different from that. If you're going to do more front end work in the future I'd at least suggest that you familiarise yourself with CSS, (SASS is just CSS but made much more manageable) it'll make your life a lot easier. CSS isn't going anywhere anytime soon unless we drastically change the way the web works, like doing away with the DOM and changing up http. Even then there *will* be a transition period, so you're set for the next decade or so.
Node is just a way to run things on a server written in JavaScript. The JavaScript you would be doing is all client side JS which runs entirely in the browser. 
It's a lot better than their previous name of "web pages". That naming was the worst.
That’s fair. I’ve only maintained existing webforms and never really delved into the specifics. 
It would made it a lot easier for us to figure out what's going on if you removed all the code that's irrelevant to this question.
&gt; System.Data.DataTable System.Data.DataTable [doesn't have a serialize method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable.getobjectdata(v=vs.110).aspx). You need to call GetObjectData. I'm not sure why the scope would effect this, however.
Makes sense. I just did it as an xml dataset/datatable. 
I'm not familiar with iOS specifics which may help, but what you describe seems like the sane approach. The UX challenge in that is how long you should wait after a tap before actually registering it as a tap \(aka, you've exceeded your timer for registering a tap\+hold\). When I tap a button, I want it to feel immediate, and not have the app wait 150ms for it to then actually tap as I'd start to notice the delay if I used an app a bunch. What I'd do is create a test button which has a timer when it's tapped, and for how long. Then, just perform your gesture on it 10 times, and get the measurements to use as a default value. Maybe get a few of your friends to do it as well to get different measurements. While I know nothing of what you're building, I'd also wonder if there might be a better way than to implement a dual\-button function that doesn't effect perceived responsiveness. Maybe implement 3D touch functionality on the button \(tap vs hard press\), and keep tap vs tap\+hold for pre\-6s devices? Maybe a simple tap vs hold functionality is enough? Just food for thought from someone who knows nothing. :\)
I know there’s also things like events though c#? And also gesture states can require other taps to fail or succeed before activating, so I assume I can set it so that once a tap succeeds it triggers the long tap gesture to change its nature/function for a set time after the tap. Again I’m real new to coding and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this in the right way but in theory this sounds possible. 
Unity and C# for beginners are great. Use the resources I gave you and you'll learn c# and unity in no time.
Tip: your else statement is missing a return value. You can't say that your function returns Användare and then have a flow that doesn't return it.
I’m sure there are control specific events such as timers that you could use. In visual studio it is very easy to change them
Definitely don’t use option b. Option a isn’t so bad, really. And this is where you might be able to use await/async pattern to make things easy and not block the UI.
What library are you using the message bus? Ideally it would raise events that you could then martial to the UI thread. If it is something older like MSMQ, then I would have a dedicated background thread either block waiting for a message or loop checking for messages (depending on the library design). When a message is received, it would again marshal the message onto the UI thread.
Perhaps a correlated async response message will help. You need some form of transaction identifier that is unique and known to the caller, and have the caller block (with a timeout) until it received the correlated response (matching transaction id) on the bus.
Removed: Rule 5.
If it were me, I'd have the calling code already generate a unique order code. Then it would do two things. First it subscribes to a message queue and listen to that queue until it sees a success/fail message that contains its order code. Second it would drop off the order message into the message queue that the singleton is listening to. You do it in that order because there can be lag in subscribing to the result queue.

Yup, I get that

I am using DevExpress' MVVM Framework which has the messenger in it. The actual code is all running on a background thread. The messenger is taking care of UI updates off in the UI thread as a seperate area of concern. Would you suggest that this means I should just stick to using the singleton directly and forget trying to message bus it? It just seems a lot neater to be doing it via messageing/decoupled....
Ok :\) Advice taken on. At current I am using await/async to call the singleton to place the order. It does work that way. Just looking to decouple it.
I understand you need those Get{Function}s as a requirement, but they're a nuisance. When that's their only functionality I'd be tempted to switch them to one liners: private static double GetDiv(double a, double b) =&gt; a/b; etc ParseInput is pretty lengthy and verbose, how do you feel about regex? $"(?&lt;=^)([\d,.]+)[\s]*?([\/\+\-\*])[\s]*?([\d,.]+)[\s]*?(?=$)" Should do the trick. Note that it won't test numbers like 2.3.2 or 2,,3.4 for validity, (so you'll still have to use tryParse) but at least it'll give you straight forward groups. An Action in C# is an encapsulation of a delegate without a return value, so you may want to rename that variable to avoid confusion. Is there a reason you're declaring Item1 and Item2 as properties? You're only using them at a local scope. In fact, don't use private properties as a general rule - that's what fields are for. That's all that jumps out to me.
Hmm, makes sense. I will think about this. It may be a lot of work just for decoupling purposes. Will think on it. Thank you heaps for your brain power.
Thank you. This makes sense to me. Anakappa \(another poster\) also suggests a similar approach. I will experiment with it!
I Don't know the norm for this this project, but I remember a couple of years ago in uni my professor requested we make a working windows form calculator that looked similar to the one that comes w/ windows. All i did was create a blank text box at the top, create buttons that when clicked would send that information to the text box. when you would click an operand it would set the text box to an array element and then clear the text box for the 2nd (or more) numbers. Something like that. Man, I wish I still had that to read how my code worked... 
They're not very good at naming things, are they?
I would still reach for a `List` quicker than an `Array` in most cases, though.
1) One liners look great indeed. 2) My ParseInput is messy, you're right, but the regex you wrote looks like Greek to me. I will take some time to learn regular expressions. 3) Got it about Action. 4) There's no reason for declaring Item1 and Item 2 as properties. Initially, I thought they would be accessed by several methods, but then I forgot to refactor. 5) If I do not specify a default result for the switch, I get the error according to which a variable is being accessed prior to initialization. One more question: now I was told to use interfaces to build this calculator. I can't quite understand how interfaces can make the code better in this particular case. Let's say there is an interface that requires the GetResult method. Will I then have to create multiple classes (for each of the operations) that will derive from this interface and implement the GetResult method? I might be wrong, but this doesn't seem rational to me. Probably, there's another way interfaces could be used smartly here? 
Quite sufficient. Through your further use of the fundamentals in asp, you will encounter problems to solve which will introduce you to the more advanced topics. 
Formatted for the eyes: * Delegates should be used * The user types a string that should be parsed as a math expression with just two numbers and one of the four operators (+, -, *, /) My first idea of using the Compute method of DataTable was, predictably, rejected I know that there is one serious flaw in the current version of the program. The input string is not validated. Apart from that, what are your recommendations and suggestions with regards to my code?
An interface can be thought of as a layout of a class that it must follow and one that multiple classes can also be defined as (Car and Truck would both implement IDriveable (Interfaces almost always end in -able)). The implementations of the interface all have a shared function with the same return type and parameter types. Just give you some ideas. 
Regex is worth learning seriously only if you use it frequently. Infrequent use means re-learning it every time. Had to do that a few times. Hate it now. Now everybody can downvote me :)
Thank you! Seems that I have done it almost the same way (except for naming). Why do we set the type of Operator to IOperator? 
How is that regex any better? It's entirely unreadable.
What are you trying to achieve by using the message bus?
Bug#1: for loop starts from 1. Arrays and strings are indexed from 0. I would use foreach to iterate through string. It would get three pieces required by calculator. After loop result could be checked if all items are there. Numbers could be parsed after the loop. Do not check for division by zero in the parse loop! This is strictly a division operator's responsibility. In switch cases functions could be called directly. No reason to use delegate unless it is some kind of requirement. Switch could be placed in the try catch block to handle exceptions like division by zero. Default case of the switch could throw invalid operator exception that would be reported by catch block. 
To add to this comment: do yourself a favour and write different, small methods. If you had done so, you could more easily see where the problem was. For instance: public class UserService : IUserService { private List&lt;User&gt; infoBank = new List&lt;User&gt;() { new User { Username = "samir", Password = "1234" } }; public User LetsGo() // f.d. NuKörVi { Console.WriteLine("Vill du: \n\nLogga in -- Tryck på (L) \n\nSkapa en användare -- Tryck på (S)"); string feedback = Console.ReadLine().ToLower(); switch(feedback) { case "l": return Login(); case "s": return CreateUser(); default: // problem was here } private User Login() { string username = AskUser("Användarnamn"); string password = AskUser("Lösenord"); User user = infoBank.Find( i =&gt; i.Username == username &amp;&amp; i.Password == password ); if (user == null) Console.WriteLine($"Okänd användare: {username}"); return user ?? CreateUser(); } private User CreateUser() { Console.Clear(); Console.WriteLine("*** Var god och skapa din användare ***"); Console.WriteLine(); /* Används inte alls: string firstname = AskUser("Förnamn"); string lastname = AskUser("Efternamn"); string address = AskUser("Adress"); string phone = AskUser("Telefon Nummer"); string email = AskUser("E-mail"); */ string username = AskUser("Användarnamn"); string password = AskUser("Lösenord"); User user = new User{ Username = username, Password = password }; Console.Clear(); Console.WriteLine("### Grattis, din användare är skapad! ###"); Console.WriteLine(); Console.WriteLine("Tryck på enter för att logga in."); Console.ReadLine(); Console.Clear(); infoBank.Add(user); return user; } private string AskUser(string name) { string output = ""; while(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(output)) { Console.Write($"{name}: "); output = Console.ReadLine(); } return output; }
I'd say go for it. 
Honestly, I just default to regex for searching in strings. It's what it's designed for, and is fairly language agnostic. I agree this is not a particularly readable example, and would need a comment - that's a criticism that can be leveled towards most regex, it behaves as a blackbox unless you really want to look at it.
Absolutely! You will come back to some of the basics you've not touched on, however that's more than sufficient to get started. In saying that though, a primer on Entity Framework and LINQ would be beneficial if you felt like it due to most of the tutorials I've seen needing it but ymnv

What's the worst that could happen? Deep dive and see what you've learnt.
I think you skipped over my point, in order to start this "one up" game. But...it made me chuckle for a split second. So thanks :)
You have two real options: 1) make an async call to the singleton with a timeout. This is fairly simple code to write and looks clean. I would recommend that the singleton also send a message on failure or success because at some point other parts of your UI will want to know what's happened. 2) This is your option a. Use the messenger all the way down. It feels dangerous at first, but it's a red herring, it's a bit like the unease some people feel replacing a synchronous call with an async one. What it does do is allow for some much more interesting workflows. sidenote: before I get on with more info on messenger usage, you mention you want to return a bool on success/failure. This is not a great idea. It would be more useful to return the entity that is actually saved to the database. The reason is twofold. First it will include any database set primary keys, which might be related to your order number. Second, whatever is saving the order might have enriched it, credit checked it, added ... stuff. All that information should be available back in the UI. There are times you don't do this. If the "order" you're placing is rarely reviewed after, then just return the minimum amount of info necessary, success/failure and failure information. You should always (never say always) return some failure information, Failure info might be, payment failed. So back to messengers. First, they're as reliable as making an async call, because in the singleton you'd just be making an async call to the server, and then either firing a message on success, or a different message if there's an exception (assuming you don't have some auto retry logic). The important thing to know is it will send a message. If you're worried about what will happen if your singleton crashes, or your app crashes, well those are things you have to deal with anyway. There's no need to propagate exceptions from the singleton back to the viewmodel, this is just another form of coupling. just make sure the singleton handles exceptions and sends a useful message when it encounters an exception. Remember, here I'm talking about exceptional events like the server is unreachable, stuff that should never ever happen, but does. If the order is rejected because the payment was declined, that's not exceptional anyway, that's a legit part of the workflow. It allows more interesting workflows. For example, if your vm is waiting for the success/failure, that usually means you can't close that view until you get the success or failure, so your order input screen will have to stay open. If it's just in a region of your app and always stays open anyway, no problem, but often they're a pop up type thing. It also means you stop duplicating code. If you are using an async call directly to the singleton, that singleton will probably still send a system wide message that the order has been placed. In advanced scenarios this allows multi user applications where orders can be edited. So CRUD is create, retrieve, update and delete. Most people get Create working because there's no contention here. Update is actually more tricky. If you open an order and it changes while you're editing it, if you have system wide messages your view can be notified and you can warn the user. VMs that fire messages are much much easier to test. They tend to have far fewer dependencies which need to be mocked or instantiated and you're no longer coupled any changes in your singleton order processing service. One more thing, it's quite common to want the success message to go back to the originating view, so there are a dozen ways to handle this. You can either add a reference to the VM's private messenger, or more usually simply have a correlation id which is persisted with the order and gives you a method of tracking the order across system boundaries. Nothing should ever block though, make use of async await now we have it as it does simplify matters dramatically. That's a slightly addled explanation, I shouldn't really write this stuff before I have a coffee in the morning. 
The fastest an easiest way to achieve that: take some hours in an afternoon and learn some CSS. It's super easy. If you managed to learn C#, basic CSS \(and in this case just implemented by you from the ground up, not an inherited big code \) is easy. You are scared because you don't know the basics. I was in your position, and learn CSS was the fastest way \(and it will be useful for the future\). Something like **bootstrap**, [semantic ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) or [bulma ](https://bulma.io/)has probably implemented the UI parts you want. It's just copy paste. But, first, learn basics.
Second Mosh, if I recall correctly this course moves quickly , so hang on to your butts!
Scratch that 16
Thank you very much. Your explanation made it click for me. Actually, I have read the chapter on interfaces in Troelsen's C# book, but, as it often happens, your understanding of a concept is very limited until you start to practice. 
+1 for knowing you shouldn't store passwords in clear-text
Yeah I've explored some security flaws. I've done this earlier but instead stored the data on a text file, now I'm looking to store it in a database instead. Isn't the industry standard to hash and salt the passwords nowadaya? 
It is, but leaks over the last few years have shown even major companies still doesn't get it.
I've heard some horror stories indeed. Namely a mobile carrier in the US saved pws in plain text and justified it with something like 'Our systems are very secure' or something incredibly vague and unsettling?
Yeah heard that too. Not cool! [There's more of them.](http://plaintextoffenders.com/)
It is good idea to implement it and learn it, but if you want to write some real app go with any good 3rd party library. Chances that you (or anyone else) can make it secure are zero compared to teams of experts doing it full time. To your db question. Good start is SQLite or mssql localDb. They are free, dont need any server and can do anything you need for start
Avoid ORMs. Unless you are extremely knowledgeable they lead to performance issues. In order to use an ORM effectively you need in depth knowledge of both databases and app code which completely invalidates their use as a database wrapper for non database people. I have yet to see an entity framework solution that did not start crawling after a short time. Microsoft sql server is fairly standard for c#. Forget everything you think you know about coding. What works in an object oriented language does not apply to set languages. 
Venkat is good, he explains things through practice, in a simple and elegant manner. He teaches you the basics so you can move on to more complicated stuff without being confused. 
One bit of Linq that might be useful (even if you need to write your own Min, Max and Average) is SelectMany. It flattens an IEnumerable of IEnumerable into a single IEnumerable. You have students, an array of Student. If you had the Student class have a public property Grades which returned your List&lt;double&gt; of grades, you could iterate through the whole lot in one go with SelectMany like so: foreach (double grade in students.SelectMany(s =&gt; s.Grades)) { //you should be able to calculate min, max and average in a single iteration }
Sure. HW requirements depend on ammount of data and queries. If it just sits and does nothing but storing few hunderds records it can run even on the cheapest raspberry
Ah nice. Do you have any resources on how to implement that idea or is it covered later on in the w3schools tutorial?
ASP.Net is not C# at all. It's a framework of classes. You could use VB or any other language that is CLI compatible. 
check out codewars for a plethora of calculator samples of variable complexity. 
Why use lookbehind/lookahead in your regex? Just using `^` and `$` alone seems to work and does fewer steps: https://regex101.com/r/SHlYfs/1/
There are several other good instructors; but the way I'd do it is watch a fundamental course, say the [one by Scott](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015/table-of-contents), then look for a course for each main topic (Generics, Collections, Interfaces, Delegates and Events, LINQ and Asynchronous programming). If you find several courses for the same topic, choose the one by Scott if exits.
You're absolutely right. A leftover from building something a lot uglier that could handle validation. 
Considering you're asking on a C# forum, MSSQL would be the typical DB for .Net applications. A good place to start is the [Adventure Works](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works) database, which published by Microsoft and has a ton of examples built around it. The phrase "learn the database" can have a bunch of different connotations, so a clearer definition of what you want to learn about the database would help. Considering you're coming from more of a development angle, I assume you're looking more for getting data in and out of the database rather than understanding backup and maintenance tasks. Start learning the language itself, SQL isn't tough, but it's declarative rather than procedural, which means you tell the DB engine what you want rather than how to get what you want. Understand all different types of joins. Understand where clauses. Understand using subqueries. You'll see a lot of C# resources reference ORMs like Entity Framework. While they're useful and productive, they really don't help in learning SQL, so it's much more important that you stay focused on SQL before dipping into using an ORM.
I'm basically trying to learn how to 1. Create a database, 2. Add information to said database via a console app \(in c#\), and 3. Querying for the data with given input \(in the console app\).
Not too addled at all (although the red herring thing I think is in reverse, maybe :)).... I must say that your explanation is exceptionally good from where I stand. You give me the courage to try it :) It makes a lot of sense You have picked a few errors I am/would be making. I shall not return just a bool. I shall return sucess/failure plus info. I am sure I will be reading this over quiet a few times as I work through things. Just curious do you have a reference to any books that you have learned this style of programming, or you just picked it up from experience in the field? Thank you so much for spending your time on me
Use Tokenization and Look into the shunting yard algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm 
I don't know if it's intentional or not, but the "Bug #1" solves the problem with first number being negative and all operations returning zero.
You should also have a decent grasp of HTML and HTTP ...
Will do, thank you. 
30K GBP seems absurdly low for the experience you desire. I used to work in London 8 years ago and we paid university grads more than that back then. 
30K seems awfully low for a developer with those skills. You may be able to find a new college graduate for that.
I'm not looking for an all singing all dancing senior developer here. £30k is a good salary for a junior C# developer in the UK, especially where the nationwide average salary is £27k It's not out of line with the average, nor similar job postings else where in the country, including London. If you have anything constructive to add then I'm all ears. 
Hi not looking for an all singing all dancing senior developer here, I'm Dad!
I may have come across incorrectly there then, I'm not looking for C#, [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/), WebAPI, AWS, and some microservices as requirements, I'm stating that's what we work with here \- happy to teach someone. There is obviously a difference in salary working in London and out, but it's a shame that the only answer seems to be more money, not how to identify good graduates. The candidate can expect pay rises within the first few years, and a yearly bonus, but that doesn't help the headline figure. 
As mentioned in another comment, those are what we work with, not requirements for the job. £30K is average for a junior C# developer in the UK [https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/junior&amp;#37;20csharp&amp;#37;20developer.do](https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/junior%20csharp%20developer.do) From your use of the word college, can I assume you're American?
£30K? That sounds like it's 50k too low. Is that really a going rate for devs where you are?
Yes it is the industry standard to salt and hash a password before storage. However to add to this, it's considered best practice to repeat the salt and hash process multiple times. I think NIST recommends something like 10,000 salt and hash iterations before use. 
I might suggest giving someone a small sample project to see what they come up with. Don't expect them to sit there and do it in front of you but give them the time you would normally expect for it to take. Then when done ask them to explain why they made the choices and design that they did. Because this would take some time on their part, and their time is just as important to them as your's is to you I would suggest only using this approach with someone you are serious about hiring.
I have to agree, that salary is very low and unreasonable for the skills you are expecting.
Don't forget [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html) 
Bad bot 
£30k is a good salary. The US bias on Reddit gets frustrating but if you're looking for a ~2 year experienced C# dev that's a good salary. For context I recently accepted a job in a medium COL area with 1.5 years C# experience at £25k as a grad. 
That's standard for the UK.
There isn't anything that will really get you to what you want without some type of styling for the visuals. We make the visuals and then make them look pretty. I would recommend maybe buying into some type of software as a service (SAS) that will get you the visuals you want. You basically tell them the data you want to display from your data and then they already have tools built to show stats. It just depends what is in your scope. But based off your other comments you don't really have the want to learn how to style the tables on your own (If you do have a change of heart, look into [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)). Which is all A-Okay! It isn't for everyone and not everyone has fun with programming. So that's why I highly recommend you look into a service out there that will visualize the data for you as there are many services to do this through.
That's a really good idea, that's what I am looking for, thank you! Really like the idea of meeting them to ask about design ideas, and why they chose to implement it in one way rather than the other. Really I just want to weed out the "I did it that way cos I found one tutorial that told me"
[https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/junior&amp;#37;20csharp&amp;#37;20developer.do](https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/junior%20csharp%20developer.do)
As a point of reference for non-UK people on here. When I started out as a junior dev (new college grad) in a major East Coast metro area the starting salary was $42k USD. Prior to that I took some time off from school to work full-time for 3+ years and the salary I had *just before I left to return to school* was $35k. I'm not sure what the current GBP-&gt;USD conversion rate is, but I can't imagine that 30k GBP is that bad for a junior dev.
Yes. C# is C#. ASP.NET is just one way you can use it. The difference between say a console application and a Web app is the classes that are in the available namespaces.
London is a totally different world. A London based job easily have an x2 multiplier on the payment - or you hardly can live comfortably. In Manchester, I get 27.5k (the drawbacks of being an immigrant) and I can easily pay the rent (for a semi-detached house about 10-15 minutes from the city centre by car - Salford), utility, keep up the car and have extra money from a single salary while my wife doing attending a full-time school. I spend around £1200 for everything and the rest is pocket money for luxury stuff. In London, the above would be barely enough to cover a room with food and public transport.
Yup it's frustrating for sure, it's literally average for a junior developer here. On top of the fact that the question was not "Why aren't I getting candidates wahh" it's "I want help selecting from the candidates that have come forward" 
Ugh, my first salary in the US in *1993* in the southwest (Phoenix) was $39k
Based on your and the other comments, a small sample project is the best way forward. Done in their own time, and a follow up where I can ask a few laid back questions \- no right or wrong answers. Thanks for your input. 
Yes, American. And as someone actively seeking a Sr. C# dev, I know the struggle you are facing. We are at record employment levels here and the only way to entice 'qualified' candidate CVs is to offer a 10-15% bump in compensation. Even with that, I'm still searching...
I can’t stress this last point enough. A good personality and someone you can reason with will cause you less headaches and may be a better fit for your specific position.
I don't know what a GPA is, I hear about it a lot in American TV shows, a grade average I think \- There is no equivalent in the UK. Good points though, and for sure I am looking for someone who hopefully will be with us for a while, and will grow with the company so concrete skills isn't big. It is much more about good attitude and someone who is on the ball and can learn. My question was how to pick those qualities in a group of candidates. 
What range would you entertain?
I have been a hiring manager or technical evaluator in most of my jobs. A simple measure of "will this person work?" is to create a small custom exercise that focuses on "can this person get data to display". Keep it simple, so the person is not overwhelmed. This task will allow you to understand where they are competent all the way through the stack. Sample exercise: **Create a web page/service/console app that displays customer data from table X in database Y.** List any specific technology they should employ, such as Stored Procedures, Entity Framework, WebAPI, etc. Choose which pieces are most important for them to know and provide some boilerplate for the rest. Meaning, if the middle tier is where they will spend most of their time, then provide the database/tables/connection string/DAL and see if they can go from there. If front end design is not in their wheelhouse, provide a master page and CSS to make use of. If you need a full stack dev, then provide nothing and see how they react. I've administered this test in both a "live, over the shoulder" fashion and in a "take as much time as you need and turn in" fashion (for remote devs). Both worked and each gives you some unique insight to the way the candidate works. You can also match "how" they work with how they claim to work (either on their resume or in the interview). For example, if someone says they are "deadline driven" and they accept an open ended assignment without worry or don't set themselves a deadline and communicate it to you, then "deadline driven" is just fluff. Look for other discrepancies like this throughout the process. "Detail oriented" with a bunch of mispellings/typos/omissions? I don't think so. If it's an in-person exercise, you can watch how they use the tools. Do they use keyboard shortcuts? Can they Google something they are stuck on? Are they willing to ask you questions or just struggle silently? Watching as they work is very stressful for the candidate, so the exercise should be able to be completed in under an hour. You will know by the end of that hour if this is someone you want to work with. Now, to protect your company's interests, you must make it clear that the code will not be used for any other purpose than evaluation and they will not be compensated for their time. Some shitheads like to come back with a bill or threaten to sue for time worked, so have your HR folks draw up a little thing they have to sign to that point.
I think you're right, this isn't an easy problem. Luckily in this instance I get final say, so although there are non technical people involved they aren't the be end. From this thread, doing a short task with some follow up questions seems to be the way forward. Any other advice?
I just created a DbContext class that inherits from IdentityDbContext class and create and ApplicationUser class that inherits from IdentityUser. You can add whatever custom fields you need in the ApplicationUser Class but still use the SignInManager and UserManager classes. It’s incredibly simple, but you do forfeit a little bit of control I guess. 
Damn, everyone here complaining about the salary requirements! Anyway, my advice is this: find an easy problem to give, which you can scale up. The idea is to 1, make sure the candidate has a basic understanding of programming. But more importantly, 2, you are able to easily communicate problems/solutions. For example, how do you know if two strings are palindromes? Then, try to engage him/her, on what's happening. When he solves it, up the difficulty, palindromes but whitespace doesn't count. Palindrome but you have infinitely long strings. You should be able to tell if you're able to work with someone from that; a lot of development, and junior development at that, is looking stuff up, anyway.
Can confirm, relitive worked in London in a IT job. 
Where are you based? Salaries differ from city to city let alone country to country.
One of the best indicators I've seen is to bring them on site for an interview. Put them in a room with a computer (with visual studio), and internet access. Tell them that they have an hour to make any program they want, using any language, and libraries they want. The only requirements are that it must have a UI of some sort, and must use a database. They should be prepared to walk you through the program and explain what they did at the end.
Like I said, London, 8 years ago. I can imagine the starting salary has gone up in London. Keep in mind OP said their location was "ball-ache" away from a major city. That doesn't sound like a 10-15 minute commute. It sounds like the company is in the middle of nowhere that is difficult to get to with nothing to do. You can expect to have to pay more than a location that's convenient for employees, kind of like if you work in a major area with high living costs, except for OP, they have high travel costs so will need compensate (literally) for that.
I wonder what the average salary in the USA was at that time. As an anecdotal comparison, I've only heard of graduates from Oxford and Cambridge go into jobs straight from uni in the £30k range. Average salary in the UK is £27k 
Puzzles are great for algorithm developers, but if people are doing ASP.Net and just getting data on a page, this exercise shows nothing. I know a lot of very productive LOB developers that couldn't puzzle their way out of a bag, but I would hire them over someone that can do mind games.

Good post. Especially working benefits like flex or partial home office get ppl going. Love the pair programming idea, I heard visual studio online offers that functionality now. 🤔 Let them edit a few APIs or something along that line and see how they behave. I would still mention the extra services but not in the requirements tab, just as a mention in the free text. Where are u based? 
I didn't want to give too much away about the location, and it's come across incorrectly. It's 40min driving into the centre of the city, it's not in the middle of no\-where, it's more of a satellite town, rather than out in the sticks. Think what Slough is to London \- if you're from the UK. 
&gt;My question was how to pick those qualities in a group of candidates Throw difficult problems at them and ask how they will approach it. Be cautious to not confuse interview nerves with an inability to reason, you can mitigate this by being approachable and prompting for what you want. Like asking them directly what their thought process is. As far as picking a good candidate for an interview, focus on resumes that include personal projects and growth areas even if they are not relevant to the job. That indicates someone who cares enough about code to do it when they don't have to.
Its the UK, 40 min driving is the middle of nowhere ;-). Driving sucks, a 40 min drive easily turns into an hour between traffic, finding parking, etc. So that's 2 hours a day a person is sitting in a car. Or they can work for a company that is in the city center, have a quarter of the commute, maybe not even need a car, get paid the same. Which would you choose?
Fighting one bug with another bug is feasible strategy sometimes. 
I was raised (lol) with the opinion that regex should not be used in production code, especially not massive expressions like that. A comment would go far in this case, but I still think you'd need a paragraph to explain your expression. I understand they often boil down to be something very innocent and simple, but it's very easy for a regex to quickly become bloated and unreadable past a simple matching rule.
&gt; £30k is a good salary for a junior C# developer in the UK, especially where the nationwide average salary is £27k Every time I see salary data from across the pond, it makes me glad to be a US developer. I should mention that I know next to nothing about the cost of living in the UK, but 30k doesn't sound like a lot of money. Maybe I'm wrong... Anyway, in the US, $45-50k is a reasonably starting wage for a junior C# dev. That figure is for the midwest -- wages are much, much higher on the coasts.
God. The one course I’ve fully completed I must have watched each video 20 times, at least.
OP said he/she was learning the bread and butter of C#. Therefore wouldn't it make more sense for OP to continue into ASP with C#? Sometimes more knowledge doesn't do anything to help.
If all IMonsters are also ILivingCreatures then you can just inherit IMonster from ILivingCreature, I.e. public interface IMonster : ILivingCreature
I don't believe that I am explicitly configuring identity as I was under the impression that it was only required when using a different authentication / authorization provider. Do you have any examples of its use in conjunction with Windows Authentication?
I haven't used it with windows authentication specifically, but Microsoft has a page on it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/windowsauth?view=aspnetcore-2.0&amp;tabs=aspnetcore2x
Make a small assignment they can do on site, over like 4 hours or so. Sit next to them and ask them questions while they work. But tell them up front what you like to see and what you find important, so they can focus on showing you their ability with that For this to work, make sure that you tell them that you expect them to research what they need to know. Just as they would during normal work. And you need to assess them on the process, not what they do not know on top of their head. You should compensate them for their time of course. E.g. have a preliminary short interview, do the test then take them for lunch and the actual interview
Holy shit, your salaries are low. In Germany the average starting salary for a junior dev with a masters degree is like 45k€ (~40k£)

Hop in! As long as you know the basics of developing with HTML/CSS/JS, you should be well on your way to ASP.NET as well. I'd start with MVC first, as its popular and you'll find a lot of resources for it.
To be fair, 30k eu = 35k usd according to google
Thank you for that link. Sadly I've pored over it again and again and have yet to find anything that details anything about expiration, timeouts, etc. At this point I am starting to feel like I've missed something obvious / undocumented or there's an issue with the framework. Thank you for the help.
I got that from the responses too, though I'm not sure how to be more clear I am not moaning about the quality of applicants. I will ask for the portfolios, they aren't normally sent with the CV from the agencies. 
Hey, so I'm fairly new to C#. Are you recommend that we learn ASP.net MVC instead of ASP.net core since there's more resources for it?
You're welcome. I've got about half a dozen books on WPF and they all cover the mechanics of WPF but imo never quite get the architecture bit right. It's possibly to do with the fact that things like messengers have been used in UIs for decades, so while they're popular they're not actually required to enact MVVM. There are a few frameworks for building applications in WPF which embody these sorts of principles, so it might be worth looking at them purely from an architectural perspective. The Things like MVVMLight (very light and open source) to Microsoft Prism (heavy and complicated but covers scenarios you'll never encounter). Honestly though once you get the idea of messengers and the decoupling, the benefits to testing and refactoring, and once you get a bit of comfort that it is reliable then it really works well. I'd suggest doing a little PoC and try and cover a few basic scenarios. I.e. parent view spawns a dialog box and gets its result (all with messengers), your example of a service that asynchronously does something based on a message and replies with a message. Those sorts of things. The problems you tend to encounter are the same as with all code. You can do funky things like have private messengers which are shared only between a parent view(model) and its children, then have a UI wide messenger. Messengers send messages, try not to have really general purpose messages because it encourages people to just dump all their crap on it. You can however pass a messenger with a message as a reply channel for example. I think the important thing to remember is that messengers in this context are all within the process (.exe) boundary, so you don't have to worry flaky network conditions preventing a message from arriving. Make that a hard and clear distinction and you'll be fine :) It's horses for courses though, there are no one size fits all solutions. 
Yes. MVC, at the moment, is more valuable and will teach you more about web development. However don't ignore Core! I think it'll become a very important technology. But at the moment, MVC is where its at.
Cool thanks!
What do you think about what hub_batch said below? &gt;Hop in! As long as you know the basics of developing with HTML/CSS/JS, you should be well on your way to ASP.NET as well. I'd start with MVC first, as its popular and you'll find a lot of resources for it.
No. I'd prefer not to use cookies as my application is an API.
Good shout, thank you for the input. 
I'm American, but worked for 6 years in the UK and manage a team with people located in the UK. So I'm familiar with the region and the job market. You gave your job specs and said "We're getting through a few CVs but not quite the candidates I'd hoped." That speaks to your job spec. As for ASP.Net, you later said it wasn't necessary to know those tech. I've been doing C# development since C# first came out, but I focus on Desktop applications. I don't really work with ASP.Net or AWS. My backend experience is mostly Java/Scala using various frameworks running on on-premises hardware. I've done microservice architecture, but it was our own architecture. Is it unfair to ask a C# developer to know these things? In short, yes, if you don't need them to or if its for a junior dev position. There are many different types of C# developers, not everyone does ASP.Net, maybe they still do MVC. Maybe they do mostly desktop dev, or write services. Maybe they are like me, I work with sensitive data, it can't live in the cloud, so I don't know AWS or Azure (which would probably be more common than AWS for a C# dev). As for the salary, if you are happy to pay 30K, then just say "30K", don't use weasel words like "Up To". I'm not setting up a strawman here, its feedback. I gave you feedback on how I do my tech interviews, nothing fancy, no homework. A phone screen then a 3 to 4 hour onsite, with 1-2 hours spent pair programming, the rest is finding out if the person is a knobhead or an ass. I'm not suggesting you find a rockstar programmer, but if you want to increase your pool of candidates to have a better chance of finding a person that is a good fit, I think you need to take a step back and figure out exactly what you want this person to know and does that dovetail with salary expectations. 
I've hired sophmore/junior college students with less experience for that salary (if they were hired fulltime which they weren't). That salary is WAY too low IMHO, especially considering in this field you can work remotely.
Ah! Thanks!
Ok, I just checked. Didn't realize your taxes were that much lower. In the end it seems to result in around the same sum (although, based on the chart I've seen, being married and having children has a lot more tax benefits in Germany, so in that situation German salary would be considerably more).
Yeah, it sucks, and Brexit will only make it worse. If you want to be wealthy and be a developer America is the place to be though. 
Do you know of any good meetups for c# devs nearby? I'm in Medford / Malden and it's always good to meet others in the area!
Alright cool. And is it wrong to assume that a lot of the concepts are transferable? Also, if I was to learn core, I'd have a significantly easier time learning ASP.NET MVC afterwards right?
Yeah I’ve honestly never seen the value in being good at those algorithms. I’ve never had to use them since a lot of languages abstract a lot of that stuff out when it comes to searching and sorting and whatnot. Design is the most important thing IMO. If you got a guy that can write algorithms all day but builds a janky system...that ain’t good.
Makes sense. Try looking into [IdentityServer](http://docs.identityserver.io/en/release/) and configuring an OAuth2 flow using JWT tokens. Though I'm not sure how you would refresh the claims / roles with that.
MVC is available on both .NET Framework and .NET Core. I would recommend using ASP.NET Core MVC over .NET Framework, as .NET Core is a much more versatile library than .NET Framework and has a lot of great resources out there to learn. I would stay away from SPAs for the moment, as they kind of compound on and add complexity to what MVC already accomplishes.
Yeah they're crazy, an absolute nightmare to figure out when I was looking at GER companies to work for and figure out necessary salary requirements etc. I agree though, engineers in the UK are paid like shit. 
What part of the UK are you in? We pay 20-25k for juniors up here!
&gt; £30k is a good salary for a junior C# developer in the UK, especially where the nationwide average salary is £27k that's awful. you guys do not value developers enough over there.
The best way is to see some code they've written. Obviously a git account would be ideal. But you can just ask them to send in a sample application they've written. They should be trying to impress you so it should be their best work. Then at the interview just talk programming with them if they can't hold a decent conversation about various topics they may be a bullshiter.
Got to regex101.com and paste it in. It breaks it down by each statement. Also let's you type an input to see what matches. I always use it for writing regex.
Thanks, ya that's what I got. Do you mind letting me know what you used to learn ASP.net core? Might be useful as an additional reference.
Visual studio gives you a template when you create a project so I just looked at it and figured out what it did for a few hours. I then dicked around with a webapi (mvc is pretty much a webapi with views)
All you need is someone with enthusiasm and willingness to learn if you are looking for someone to work under you as a Junior dev. If you want someone with experience then pay more. Otherwise, whoever you pick will just have to be someone you like teaching and likes to learn from you. I see so many job postings reqcuiring uneeded amounts of experience when a lot of things can be learned on the fly. I would just hire someone you want to mentor.
Yeah, there are actually quite a few depending on your interest(s)... There's [New England Microsoft Developers](https://www.meetup.com/NE-MSFT-Devs/), [Microsoft DevBoston](https://www.meetup.com/DevBoston/), and the [Boston Mobile C# Developers' Group](https://www.meetup.com/bostonmobiledev/) for a few examples. PM me if you want with specifically what you're interested in and I can give you some more insights.
Fair play then. They weren't job specifications, and that wasn't the question asked twice in the post though. I didn't ask to "increase my pool of candidates". Come on man most of your post contained criticisms of the job posting of which I was deliberately unclear about, as I didn't ask for feedback about it. It's not a needed to be an expert in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), but in the job you would be expected over time to work with it, could be after a year they start with that. The role is flexible, if they're no good at [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) then I'll do the development on [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) and they can do something else until they can be trained up on [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET). This was good advice though: "I would NOT want my #2 developer to be a college grad. They are a lot of work to manage."
I had such a great time presenting at Microsoft Build 2018! If you have any questions or would like help getting started, let me know how I can help! DMs are open 👍
This would be the best way. Then you only have to loop through the items once and the results once to write it out.
GPA is grade point average. A is worth 4.0, B is worth 3.0, C is 2.0, D is 1.0. If you get a A in English and a B in history and a C in math your GPA = (4.0+3.0+2.0)/3=3.0 A 3.0 student is decent. A 4.0 is someone who gets perfect scores in all their classes. Now you can appreciate American high school and college themed tv shows.
Happy to help! I think you made the right decision. This way you are getting a glimpse into how they work in a real world situation and they are not under huge pressure to get everything correct right before your eyes. I used to work at a place where one of the people on the team liked to "grill" applicants on the spot. I hated how he did that. It's like he got is kicks off making people squirm. Sad really.
wow, I stand corrected.
Thank you, this is what I am after, you've covered all of what I asked. I am aware of the constraints of the salary and it seems like "what we're working with" has been understood as "person needs to know" and that wasn't my intention, my hope was to attract people to work with something they might want to get into. I am flexible as to how solutions are implemented, but for all the confusion this has caused people I think it's probably worth taking it off, and simply stating C# in technologies for the job role. I fully expect to train this person and send them on any kind of courses they want and that are relevant to what we're doing, and I think this ties in to the last bit, I really don't need them to know anything about AWS, but I want them to know that after a maybe year, and training they'd be expected to work with it. I will be setting a small task, then asking some follow up questions for the people who have come forward. There's some really good points in there to bear in mind when speaking to these people, thanks again. 
I stand corrected. 
This already has a lot of response so I can’t really add more than my two pence. Also should mention I am speaking as a java developer so that may tweak my perspective a little. By and large I haven’t seen difference between java and .net offerings when I have looked/applies. When I have interviewed people I have had best results from a technical test. It needs to be something easily understood. Probably with a focus on use of data structures. In a short interview it is less about assessing cleanliness of code so I wouldn’t labour on design patterns or code cleanliness topics unless there is time to discuss at the end. The key part of any technical interview is to discuss the solution. The technical test shouldn’t really be a pass/fail activity and for the same reason I would steer clear of written exams. The pre filtering of candidates for interview is the hardest part. Most common approach is a telephone interview. Ask a few easy programming questions and a few hard ones to get a rough idea. But you’ll find you need to interview people in person to get any idea at all about what they are really like. I have had a lot of mileage around getting people to find ways to use caching and indexing to optimise some problem for speed, so proper use of dictionary and iterating a collection efficiently come pretty high on my list of desirables. It’s amazing to see how many candidates don’t really grasp the concepts involved in that so if you get a graduate who seems like they can they are probably worth grabbing. I’m sure you don’t need to be told to beware bullshitters, lots of those around. Graduates will need some training so you can almost consider their first 4+ months wasted as they come into their own. Salary wise I didn’t see an area in England in your post but maybe I skipped a bit. Anywhere near London and you just won’t get anyone for 30k graduate or not. Outside of London for a graduate I would expect a salary range of 25k-30k based on experience and other factors. I suspect this is why you see so many cvs for fresh graduates proportionally to other types of candidate. Foreign workers tend to be cheaper for a little while while they find a footing in the UK but I suspect with brexit we have fewer of those You can find good developers at that salary but you need to put in a lot of work. At which point you may have wasted all the benefit on your own salary. Bare in mind that at that salary you’re likely to have a high turnover of staff as people leave for bigger numbers. 
Having worked for small organizations and large, I completely get that mindset in terms of responsibilities. Though my point is more focused on setting priorities for what skillset you want to hire vice getting a "better fit" or more candidates. Just because you start with clearly defined responsibilities, does not mean you need to stick with them long term. Say you hire an inexperienced CS grad, start them working for you with a list of responsibilities that lighten your work load (since I'm assuming that's why you need another programmer) and see how they do. As they develop within the company, you may be able to transition more to the fast and loose we're all a team, no strict responsibilities mindset with them, but some people, especially those lacking work experience may flounder in that kind of environment from the start. If I was in your position, I would pick a single function, and devise your interview around that function. Once you have your hire, I would start them solely on that and over time I would gradually bring them into other functions. Another benefit of this approach is that if it doesn't work out, you don't lose too much if you fire them or they quit early on.
It's probably due to cost of living, some places in america have a rediculous cost of living even in the lower 48. California, New York, and metropolitan Texas areas are some good examples. It's hard to offer someone 30k/yr. When that would barely cover the cost of a house. That's pretty nearing lower class. I get paid like 28k/yr. In the America army for example. 
yeah, I mean developer salary is a sorry state of affairs compared to the USA, would be awesome to get a greencard and earn what the average developer does there. It's not the full picture though as cost of living and taxes help balance it out but it doesn't make up for it. 
I'd run them through a couple very simple FizzBuzz types problems, just to weed out the idiots. Ask them some simple to mid-level difficulty type questions just get a feel for where they're at and if they actually know something, or they just Google answers and type randomly until it works. I'm not a fan of trivia type stuff like "exchange the value in two variables without using a third". You could write out some small functions with errors and ask them to find the problem. Or talk about how they would fix it/done it differently. And if you still like them, give them the mini-project to take home.
Which course is that, if you don't mind me asking, Theozone1990? I, too, am a big fan of repeating stuff. I guess it's just how I learn best, frustrating at times but at least I know that it works. I gotta hammer it in until it stays for a bit :)
Can you share the contents of your _ViemImports file?
I would change that opinion. A lot of times regex's are amazing, things such as credit card matching, email matching, etc, are all really good uses of regex. Can it be abused? Sure, like anything else \(LinQ is another big offender\), just use it correctly.
Good advice, thank you. Do you see a benefit to asking the candidate in person in the interview \(obviously being wary of nerves\) vs asking them to go away overnight and work on something?
There is no E. F is for fail. F=0
Honestly sounds like a good job for someone fresh out of school or about to graduate. We've all been there right? Think of what made you good when you were just starting out. Hey I want a new job lol. You got a lot of stuff to do? I did a whole side project for free for some guy just to demo my skills because I just love software and I was bored. Pay me 70k$ a year and I'll move to the UK and work for you😊 I don't think a programming test is a bad thing. A short open ended application is fun for people. I got my dev first job like that.
I think you're right, from what I've seen cost of living is vastly different. 
Yup, that's exactly the type of person I'm looking for. I don't need a guru, just someone keen to learn, and move forward together. Good point, for me it was just the eagerness of creating something that people might use I think that set me apart, and this is what I hope to find in someone too. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money to spend on someone 
I like this idea &gt; You could write out some small functions with errors and ask them to find the problem. Or talk about how they would fix it/done it differently. I just thought the hiring process nowadays didn't rely on so much on the simpler trivia questions, (haven't been through it in a while myself) but maybe the do serve a purpose. 
Wow, sounds like a nightmare. I am really lucky to work in the company that I do, there's no one like that here, it's all really laid back. I've always said to myself I'd just leave if anyone tried anything like that but I guess it's not that simple in the real world. 
Yes, I would see an advantage to asking in person. That advantage is that you'll have more insight into their thought process than you would if they just presented a completed solution. Besides which, the solution they present may be inelegant due to not knowing some cool .NET shortcuts, and you don't want to confuse lack of experience with lack of skill.
If you offer the average, realize that half of employers are more enticing. While they may not be requirements to obtain the job, they are requirements to do the job, and as the expectations of the job increase, so do the expectations of compensation. More work, more pay. Also, that site is not necessarily reliable. "The median annual salary for a Junior C# Developer was £30,000 in **advertised job vacancies** during the 6 months to 21 May 2018." Considering that companies lowball their advertised salaries, that doesn't mean they find someone, much less someone good, at that advertised salary.
I assume this is your first programming language? Instead of reading books, start making some things. Something really simple like, a "Guess the number game" or a utility that will look through a directory and find a file name you type in the command line. As you hunt and peck your way through getting small projects like that done on your own, you may find you learn better than just reading or watching videos. you might also consider resources that teach programming in general, rather than C# in particular. 
You wrote "ASP.NET is like C# on steroids." That's inaccurate. ASP.Net is a set of classes and a paradigm for dynamic web pages. It is independent of a specific programming language. 
I work a lot in PowerShell and a little Python. Besides that, I don't have a programming background. Thanks for the tips.
I think the key to finding and hiring good candidates is identifying what traits you believe makes a "good developer" is and then tailoring your interview to give candidates a chance to showcase those skills if they have them. The skills for me are 1) Ability to find information 2) Writes readable and maintainable code 3) Can handle disagreement and criticism 4) Works well with others / doesn't require or prefer to be siloed off on their own I tried to set aside at least an hour for each interview, preferably two hours. I would just shoot the shit with them for the first 15-20 minutes. Find out what they are passionate about, how the pursue their passions, and whatever else I can do to loosen them up. Then I give them a laptop and I ask them about something we use on the job, a framework or library or tool, and ask them a question about how to do something with it. If they say they know it, have them code it out to see if they lied to you. If they say they don't, ask them to look it up. Be prepared to have them look up certain things, like how does one implement a custom grid toolbar in Kendo UI? I then watch to see how they go about finding this information, which covers #1. If they did lie to you and it becomes obvious that was the case, don't dismiss the candidate outright because some people handle the stress poorly. Just say "I need you to be honest with me going forward or I won't be able to properly assess if you will be a fit here." and give them another chance to demonstrate #1. I would handle 2-4 by having the candidate do a live coding exercise. I found having them code the backend a common card game that they know is often a good way to go. It will show you how they organize things, what their code looks like, and it's implementing a concept that they are familiar with which should get rid of some of their nerves. Watching them work on this will cover #2. During the course of the coding exercise I look for opportunities to play devil's advocate wherever possible. If they handle the questions poorly, or get overly defensive, then they probably aren't a good candidate. I don't ask aggressive questions, but mostly just "why are you doing this? why aren't you using that?". That covers #3 And to handle #4 I look for opportunities to attempt more pair programming style interactions during the coding exercise. "I like what you are doing here, but can I make a suggestion?" and ask for control. I'll code something up and ask them what they think. The one thing I never do is ask memorization or definition questions, even of entry level developers as I see no value in them. I don't care if you know exactly how a bubble sort works and I will probably never need you to write one because there is a nuget library for just about everything these days. I don't care if you don't know the definition of polymorphism because you can find it on Wikipedia in seconds. I'd rather them be able to find out which type of sort would be best in a given situation quickly and accurately. Hopefully this is helpful. I will say that I used this to hire 6 candidates so far out of maybe 30-40 interviews. The first two were with my first company and they worked out so well that I became expendable and got laid off. The other 3 are still with the company I interviewed them for and last I heard they were all climbing the ladder there. The last apparently prefers to hop from job to job after a few months because he gets bored, but I've heard that his limited time at the company I interviewed him for was a positive.
Buddy...I know that. Please reread OP's post. He asked if learning the basics of C# is sufficient enough for him to get going in ASP. Me saying ASP is LIKE C# on roids isnt all that entirely untrue, and for a bare bones rookie like OP, it is not detrimental for him to think that way. Just calm down...
I'm OK with a very simple programming challenge or two simply because they can weed out the really bad candidates quickly. But questions should pertain to what they'll actually be doing, or general knowledge that someone in that job should know without looking it up. 
Are you writing code? Have you started from Hello World, then added operators, variables, ifs, loops, methods, classes, inheritance, etc. ? 
Bro, if you spew inaccuracies, expect to be corrected. You're welcome.
I did, and yes. I know what all of those things are from scripting in PowerShell. I just can't remember how certain things are written in C#.
Well, I was thing along the lines of, you have a junior dev, fresh from university. They want to live someplace interesting, fun, etc. So that would likely be a major city, like Manchester. They will probably have a flat and a roommate or two. When considering two jobs. If the one in the city center, 10 minutes away by public transport pays the same as a job 40 minutes to an hour away by car which would they choose? I know in other responses you've said you are happy with quality and quantity of candidates you've gotten so I guess that immaterial.
So its inaccurate to say asp uses c#...especially when saying that to someone asking if c# is sufficient for ASP? I didnt thank you.
Can you give an example? There are some things that the IDE will do for you and other things you must internalize. 
I was following the courses on Jesse Liberty's Pluralsight courses. He would make different very small console applications. I also started on a "gradebook" application.
Dude, you didn't say ASP.Net 'uses' C# (which is still wrong, BTW), you said "ASP.NET is like C# on steroids." You're just making it worse, pal. 
Wow, that's a great post. 
I've tried working with HR, but they are NOT good at putting together job listings. In reality, most suck at. They copy/paste whatever they get into some template and call it job done. I think of job listings as advertisements. You want your job listing to catch candidates eyes, especially the candidates you want. Sometimes that means accentuating the project sometimes that means accentuating the benefits, sometimes the salary. For example, lets say I'm looking for a developer with 10 years of experience. To me, that means the person is likely in their early 30s, probably has some sort of spouse. Good chance they have a kid or planning on having kids soon. I'm going to mention that we do flex working and that we work 9-to-5. We rarely work long hours, and don't do weekends. A twenty year old might not care that much, but a person with a family will.
What things are causing you problems? Syntax? What particular aspects?
I suggest you do some research yourself, pal dude bro. Take care and enjoy your day!
Honestly, I think all of it. I mean I know what they're doing when they're creating classes, methods, types, etc. I just can't retain how they're doing it. The theory is in my head, but how it's happening isn't.
&gt; I just want to know how to pick the best one Your a programmer, and it sounds like you're involved in the selection and interview process? Just talk to them about stuff. Cover a breadth of stuff you do and encounter in your day to day. It's usually pretty easy to catch on when people do and don't know what they're talking about. And review code they've written with them.
I’m a junior developer in the UK, and I don’t understand all these comments about the pay. That pay is extremely competitive for a graduate developer in the UK, and we know we are paid less than in the states. That’s just how it is. Anyway, when I went for my interviews at my current job about a year ago, I loved how I was interviewed, so feel feee to PM me and I can explain the process I went through for you. 
Was in similar situation. After initial interview I gave them an outline of a tiny project we'd have them create (Make an asp.net/MVC site, connect it to a dummy database and create a secure login page and account details display page) on the next interview. Then a few days later we called them back and asked them to preform the task we'd previously outlined. We gave them access to a dummy db prepared for this with existing sps etc, didn't want to pressure them with APIs yet and by them connecting to sps correctly it was another indicator for me. Gave them the option to work away for a couple of hours in-house one one of our dev machines or their own device. There was no restrictions on them using preprepared code or googling direct answers. I just wanted to see if they could work or freeze, they didn't have to finish just show good progress in their time. This straightforward test showed me a few things, how forward thinking they were, a few days even for a beginner is enough time to make an MVC site at home and prepare it in a USB stick for the day in question removing a lot of ground work in advance, if they were uncertain what machine they would be working on. How knowledgeable they are, how far they can get in a given time frame, if not preprepared then whether they were too honest/scrupulous to 'cheat' or overconfident in their skills or underestimated the work over time it would take. How they approach a project, front end layout or back end first etc. How they worked under the pressure of a deadline and whether that might be too much for them. (Some people can get semi-violent when frustrated and it's not great for an office environment.) In the end I'd review it with them and have them walk me through their process, give a glance at date created stamps on some files, and ask what steps they would take next. I have found really hard working and sturdy developers this way. 
Grad devs start at £20-25k. I've never seen more than £25k, for both big and small companies.
I tried changing the "pattern" variable to both Regex expressions you posted one at a time, and neither of them gave me the result I was looking for. In fact, they seem to work the exact same as @"\[\\S\]" . Input: "g g" @"\[\\S\]" = Valid @".\*\\S.\*" = Valid @"\^.\*\\S.\*$" = Valid Since there's a space in the middle of the Console.ReadLine\(\) input, I want it to be counted as invalid in that scenario.
You're test says it's valid if the string contains a non-space character, which is different from saying that it's invalid if it contains a space. For example: "foo bar" would be valid, because it contains a non-space character.
Now you are looking for 1 non-space character. What you need to do is look for a space (?=\h+) Do you really need regex to do this? You could also try the String.Contains() method
Your test says it's valid if the string contains a non-space character, which is different from saying that it's invalid if it contains a space. For example: "foo bar" would be valid (according to your code), because it contains a non-space character. So change the regex to @"\s" (you don't even need the character class) and then flip the if/else
As seen in the other responses, `\S` refers to everything except spacing, you want to use `\s` instead
Seconded, this is the advice I'd give op. Actually making things is what gets the info to stick, not going over books/tutorials. Having a project forces you to Google a lot, and when you learn something it's always in the context of what you're practically trying to do, rather than on the context of learning c#in the general/abstract sense.
Thank you.
Also checkout [MS SQL Server Compact](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17876) if you don't want to install whole SQL Server
I don't need to regex this specifically, but I still want to learn how to do it with regex. If I try: string pattern = @"\(?=\\h\+\)"; or string pattern = "\(?=\\h\+\)"; or string pattern = @"\[\\S\]\(?=\\h\+\)"; I get an error indicating it doesn't recognize /h as a valid escape sequence.
So, you've worked through an entire C# book, cover to cover, done every project and example, and you still can't do anything in C#? Which book was that? I'd hate to recommend it to anybody.
/u/oddark nailed it on the head, but I wanted to add that it is helpful to use a web-based PCRE regex tester when it is not clear what a regex is doing. In this case, it would have shown that the regex is matching non-whitespace characters.
yeah its kinda like, you can read about mountain biking but if you want to get good at mountain biking you gotta get on a bike and go. yeah you are gonna fall over a few times, its ok! 
In my experience, it reversed. The further away you are from the big cities (with a lot of choice of employment) the crappier the wage what you get. I won't say it is true here in the UK, most of my experience for crappy far away places are coming from Eastern Europe, but as far as I saw here it is the same: the farther you are from big cities, a less pay you are going to get because there won't be any competition who is going to steal your workforce if you don't pay enough.
Good suggestion, just found [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) and it does exactly what I need it to do in terms of testing. Thanks.

mate, why don't you hire remote? sometimes the back yard is a bit small :)
A first class student with experience (year long placement and maybe summer internships), you can easily get above 30. Just my placement was almost 20k. The average grad/junior role I saw a couple years ago was 27k. When I graduated, myself and all of my friends got roles in the 33 to 45k range, some in the biggest cities, others in medium-sized ones. We are all C# web devs though, no idea how much this applies to other languages and platforms.
What a beautiful setup you've got my man. Enjoy!
I would say, the max commute an average person would do is an hour each way. If your company is with that distance of a major metropolitan area, then you are part of that metropolitan area and are subject to the economic forces at play. Outside of that range, yeah, pay will drop and so will the size of your candidate pool. OP said their company was located about 40 minutes from a major city center. That says to me they are on the periphery of the metropolitan area, but still subject to the economic forces inside the area. 
can't Monster be both ILivingCreatures and IMonsters too? I guess that helps with assuming all monsters aren't living \(or able to move\)? public interface IMonster { public void Attack\(\) { ... } } public interface ILivingCreature { public void Move\(\) { ... } } public class Monster : IMonster, ILivingCreature { ... }
Thank you, you've been a great help. You've also inspired me to start learning Regex, since it seems pretty powerful once you know how to use it properly.
That's the way I personally interview. Phone interview: * Discuss previous experience - what they did, how they worked (did they just get tickets from above or participated in requirements gathering etc) * ask about common patterns you use, e.g. entity framework, mvc, mediator, singleton, etc. What does the candidate know about them, etc. * Talk about what the candidate is interested to learn. If you are happy enough with the answers, for the in person interview ask to see code. Can be side project, dissertation work, anything that is significant enough. Discuss the code, why the applicant did it the way he did it, how the project was conducted (planning, prototyping, testing etc). What would the applicant change if he was to start the project now. Without seeing code you have are basically rolling a dice instead of making a calculated risk. That's the gist of it. The main thing I'm looking for is enthusiasm, thinking before doing, and reflection on his/her's strengths and weaknesses. You will have to train the new employee anyway, so might as well focus on getting someone that will pick it quickly and can survive without constantly holding his hand. The latter is especially important in your case.
Check the code you are using to manage the tests, very often if the test runs on its own but wont run as part of a larger group of tests its how your context is being managed that is causing the problem.
Console apps are a good place to start coming from a scripting background. IMO you can get a good start by simply rewriting your PS scripts in C#. Don't focus on classes, or APIs, or DI, and you can even code your whole program in the 'main' method if you like (although you should still use methods to reduce repeated code). Once you get a good handle on syntax and how to translate your 'problem' into C# syntax *then* you can start learning about object oriented programming and all of the other cool things that C# has to offer.
Tuples are useful for asnc/await when you need multiple returns. Especially internal functions that don't justify a single-use class. Otherwise I have always regretted using tuples.
hi..thanks for your response. Sorry, don't understand what you mean. The integration test I'm running is not running as part of any other larger group of tests. It's just a stand alone test. So, please what do you mean by 'how the context is being managed'?
You can attach the debugger on a unit test and step through it (usually hotkeyed to F10) until it hits something that blocks the execution forever/for a while. A guess: it blocks on IO/network without a timeout or with a retry loop that ignores exceptions.
Aah, that's pretty smart actually! I think that's what I'm gonna do, and then populate the 'Users' DbSet via querying the REST Api that handles the database. Thanks for the answer!
Definitely a fair position to have. I think of it as leveraging a default library to avoid writing unnecessary code, but it can require some patterns that look like black magic. Ultimately I think it's a preference decision made by the programmer(s) working on a project. In a case like this I think it's a fine choice - declare it as something like NumberAndOperatorPattern (long name, but descriptive) with a comment like //ignores whitespace, collects numerical characters And its usage should be clear enough without needing huge documentation. That said, there's a reason why I asked the op how they feel about regex! 
Hey OP! I currently work essentially about 40-50 mins from a major city and about 20 mins from the nearest big town in the UK. So I can relate to what you are after. I started as a junior developer with my company with about 4 months of self taught C# experience and some A level experience from quite a few years back. I started on 18k and once they realised I learnt quickly and had a good grasp of what was occurring I got bumped up but a few grand. I'm currently now no longer considered a junior and but my pay is under 30k still. This leaves me with a good life style and is plenty pay wise. So I would say your 30k offer for somewhere outside of London and in a smallish town is good I think. When we hire developers we don't bother with CVs people can right anything on them. Code tests, like hacker rank, don't always measure what you want. What we ask people to do is a small project to solve a small problem relevant to our business. This gives them a taste of what we do, it shows us how they code and tells us infinitely more than a CV would. If it seems like a good project, we invite them in, discuss it with them, do a bit of a code review and then ask them to extend the project as part of the second stage. I would say it's great way of getting a gauge of someone's skills. However... Code projects should not be too cumbersome or take too long, someone could be applying for several jobs and asking a candidate to take more than an hour or 2 out of their day just for your role, I think is asking a bit too much. If you've got any questions that you think I can help with give me a shout!
Don't know how to attach the debugger. But I'm not placing 'Debug.Asserts' around areas that could potentially be the issue. So,take it this is the only think I could do? Also, how can I do it to block an execution running forever.. Either way, I'm looking into it. 
What do you mean you can't retain now they're creating a class? If it's the syntax, the IDE does most of the work for you assuming you're using vs. Is it the object aspect? A class being a car means it has some properties such as a TopSpeed. Are you struggling with the syntax to declare a TopSpeed? We can't really help without knowing what you are struggling with. Do you know what you want to do but are struggling to write the text (I know I need cars, but how do I write what a car is) or do you just not know what you need to do... 
You're using visual studio? Open the `Test Explorer` window and debug the long running unit test: https://i.imgur.com/Q33Sg9Q.png
Seriously me, learn to write short things!!
It does litter you code quite a bit if you have a lot of them, though.
In the past yes, but now that they are structs with real field names I prefer the tuples for non-public code.
Thanks. Yes, thats how I'm running the tests
So What Exactly is a View-Model? https://www.infoq.com/articles/View-Model-Definition
Removed: Rule 2.
Check your while loops and nested for loops, if any. Check you have your 'break' statements correct. Just the first thought that jumps at me.
\&gt; It seems to be adding an unnecessary step and making the code more complex for little benefit. Yes for small projects, but for medium/big projects, doing code behind you will end with spaghetti code. \&gt; Or maybe I just haven't found a good source of information on the best way to instantiate viewmodels from an underlying data model. I guess you need to read more about MVVM.
I recommend working through [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer-fundamentals) if you haven't already (or maybe skip around it)
Nowadays every minor web thing seems to require a node server. That is my impression after looking at few random javascript projects. I could be wrong. 
&gt; Some people claim reusabilty, but beyond a base ViewModel class with some common functionality, it's usually best to avoid going down this route. I think you are misunderstanding (and underestimating) what reusability means with MVVM. First, you can create a View/ViewModel for showing user details (it is an example), and use that View/viewmodel inside any ViewModel where you need that component. Do you really think that is not a good thing? Composing views with another views helps a lot. Second, you can reuse all of some ViewModels in another project, even in another platforms. You can write a WPF application and reuse most ViewModels in a Xamarin Forms app. 
Just follow the samples form books or videos, write the code yourself following examples.
Easier? do you prefer writing single case/use classes, with more code to maintain? IMHO, it is easier: public (string name, int age) GetUserInfo(string username) { // code here } For 2-4 items, ValueTuple is really easy to implement and you don't need more code/classes.
Ive found tuples useful for the same reasons: public static async Task&lt;(TA, TB)&gt; WhenAll&lt;TA, TB&gt;(Task&lt;TA&gt; task1, Task&lt;TB&gt; task2) { await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2); return (task1.Result, task2.Result); } and then var (teacher, student) = await TaskHelper.WhenAll(getTeacherTask, getStudentTask); 
Neat
Is the problem the language structure, or object oriented programming that's the issue?
I believe it’s more of the structure itself. I’m going to go over the “C# from scratch” course from the beginning on Pluralsight. Hopefully it’ll help clear some things up. 
You're starting with a string. Strings are made up of characters. So if you have a validation requirement that only a-z are allowed, do something similar to this: for each character in the string, see if it's less than 'a' or greater than 'z' The trick is you need to also check for the upper-case letters. So make a copy of the string first, and convert to upper case (ToUpper) so the code is roughly something like: string foo = FirstName.Text.ToUpper() foreach (char c in foo) { if (c &lt; 'A' || c &gt; 'Z') { // its bad } } 
What does a snr c# dev fetch in your part of the world? 
The future of .Net talk covered Blazor at the very end. Some of the audience was impressed, but most of them I think had already become of aware of it.
Yeah not trying to do his homework, others put him in the right direction. I wouldn’t believe it came from a student but I think mine is actually more simple and readable than the conventional C style implementation
&gt;I know this is a point of order, I'm not trying to be a dick here. You never use a View inside a viewmodel. The view binds to the viewmodel, the viewmodel never knows anything about the view. This is the fundamental concept of the separation of concerns in MVVM. I'm not talking about using a view inside a viewmodel. In ReactiveUI, there is a component that you can insert in any view, this component is for doing viewmodel navigation. From the main ViewModel side, you only call "Navigate.Execute\(new PersonDetailsViewModel\(\)\)", then, the component can look for the PersonDetailsView, inject the PersonDetailsViewModel inside the PersonDetailsView, and insert the PersonDetailsView inside the component.
That's my impression as well. Considering the other languages the OP used are python and powershell which let you sort of say what you want to do line by line I imagine the forced OOP model of C# is causing issues.
You just threw a whole bunch of new concepts and syntactic sugar at someone who is trying to group things into groups of 10 using a for loop man.. Sometimes you have to write it the long way before you can understand the basic logic behind what it is you have to do to solve the problem.
That's why I said "kind of like"
Hopefully he has it figured out by now but here's the long way. I guess if I had any advice to share it would be pre-arrange the data as close as possible to make it easy to use. You could do this if the data was sorted with one "pass" but I think it's clearer pre-counting the grades. int[] gradeBuckets = new int[11]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; students.Count; ++i) { var grades = students[i].Grades; for (int j = 0; j &lt; grades.Count; ++j) { gradeBuckets[grades[j] / 10]++; } } for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 10; ++i) { if (i &lt; 10) Console.Write(i + "0 - " + i + "9: "); else Console.Write("100: "); for (var j = 0; j &lt; gradeBuckets[i]; ++j) { Console.Write('*'); } Console.WriteLine(); }
I’d suggest learning MVC it’s becoming more and more of a requirement job-wise.
If I could go back in time 10 years or so to when I started working with databases and give myself advice it would be to not use SSMS table designer, learn to create tables by hand. Make sure all your tables have a primary key and be intelligent where you need a surrogate key or not. Make sure you're using foreign keys. Make sure you specify NOT NULL for required columns.
heh I actually do find the LINQ way of doing it much clearer. But I also have PTSD from explaining this stuff to people who are incapable of firing up a console app to test it out and see what it's doing.
I actually wrote that article. Mostly because I was getting into too many arguments about what should or shouldn't be in the view-model. And over time I came to realize that while there was no consensus, most people fell into one of the categories I listed. Once you narrow down which definition of view-model *you* are using, I can make recommendations on what or shouldn't be in it and why. But as to your questions about user controls, hell yea. If you want to be a good WPF developer, knowing how to push logic into custom user controls puts you in another league. Far too many developers don't know how to make their own controls and consequently use the view-model as a dumping ground for logic that really should be encapsulated in the control. 
Yeah my LINQ complexity tolerance is maybe just slightly more complex than the one I posted earlier, much more complex than that it's going into a stored procedure, I can't deal with the 30+ line EF/LINQ queries that get posted in here sometimes. Being able to project data into the exact structure you need is so helpful for situations like this. If you can get a rolled up count of grades grouped by 10s, your "view" code becomes that much clearer. I actually just had to refactor something very similar at work today, some code that was looping over a flat list that of checkboxes and having to check if the parent changed, so it was keeping track of "previousParent". And then after the loop finished it needed an extra bit of code to close off divs etc. So much easier grouping the List&lt;Thingy&gt; to a Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;Thingy&gt; and looping over the dictionary and then looping over the values. @foreach (var group in myDictionary) { &lt;h4&gt;@group.Key&lt;h4&gt; @foreach(var thingy in group.Value) {
You could always look into a service like macincloud.com. I personally haven’t used it but did consider it before I went the Mac min route. I also remember reading that Microsoft was working on a solution that integrated with VSTS though I am not sure if it is available for the personal level.
If you need to understand scope, start with reading about OOP. Might put that into perspective and alter your thinking to understand the “backend” a bit more
I always start out doing this, but end up changing it to a result class every time. Something about the tuple still feels wrong.
I did something similar to xampl9’s solution recently but used char.IsLetter as the check. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yyxz6h5w(v=vs.110).aspx There are also a IsLetterOrDigit and a IsDigit methods too. 
&gt; People in the UK don't have to pay 10k just to get seen in a hospital emergency room, or pay extortionate fees to have a baby delivered. Generally I would expect most/all full time developer positions in the US would include health insurance
Yes I would also need to use isdigit for the phone # and zipcode parts hah
Disagree with Mosh's courses. All he does is show you how to do this or how to do that. He doesn't push for any deeper understanding of why the code does what it does or give any big picture incite. Those who want to know WHY in addition to HOW to do something, look into courses on Pluralsight by Shawn Wildermuth, Scott Allen or Kevin Dockx. 
It’s the beginner C# course offered by Microsoft. It’s taught by a guy named Bob Tabor. He just really clicks with me for some reason. The other free Microsoft courses I’ve tried have not been anywhere near the same level of quality. It’s Tabor is good enough that I’m planning on subscribing to his site, Dev U.
Depends on how much time you spend. Be confident with the language grammar. Try solving C# puzzles. If you are already familiar with OOPs, that’s well and good or else try to understand basics of OOAD. You may feel that your learning pace is slow but if you get basics right, it will be a cake walk to understand other concepts. If you feel lost, try to find a sample C# course catalogue and follow it. You can choose web or windows development later.
I have found Tuples particularly useful on dashboards where multiple sources of information have to be assembled within a single model. In the page’s method, I use a Tuple to call multiple private methods that assemble and output the data needed. That way, a single vehicle (the tuple) is passed on to the model that contains all the required bundles of data. Very neat, very clean. Plus, tuples are useful in many other places as ways of packaging multiple disparate chunks of data together. Granted, using a tuple should always be a judgement call. You shouldn’t use it just because, and tuples can certainly be abused and misused just like anything else.
I am currently only learning as a hobby, but I think it’s a great idea to learn as much as possible :)
Really appreciate it. And I’m not familiar with OOPs. Though I’ll look into it. Thanks!
A good question to ask is to write all the different ways of writing a loop on c#. See if you get them to do a goto backwards for fun. 😀
I say do what you can on a Hackintosh. Unless its illegal to do so, I don't see why you need to buy a device to contribute to their content.
I'm looking for work. PM me and I'll send you my resume if remote is fine.
This is like saying "I've never used a List once". I mean, great, you are thinking and solving the problem in another way, but you're also missing out on a great library data structure that has many uses and can greatly assist in writing readable and concise code.
Programming websites isn't science
I don't think that's fair. Tuples can, for the most part, be replaced with classes. And for public APIs, should be. There isn't really a good alternative to a dictionary in the general case 
30k in the US is almost poverty
I only wish I had the functionality of generics from Java. One thing for example is being able to do List\&lt;?\&gt; or having IBanana\&lt;T\&gt; and storing it in a list like List\&lt;IBanana\&gt; \(note the lack of the specification of what T is\).
 public interface IBanana&lt;T&gt; : IBanana It isn't pretty, but it works.
Oh Guthix, why. I suppose that would work but yes, certainly not pretty.
I have to use it all over the place in my ORM.
It's because you'll always wonder wtf Item1 refers to at a glance. 
There are several examples of tuples in public apis. And there are cases where tuples are the only way.
I'm a PC guy myself but my work required me to start using a MAC for xamarin development. I spent a couple of weeks working with a VM that ran painfully slow learning what I could before we things got busy. I wasted at least 16 hours in the first 2 weeks waiting for that VM after that I gave up and bought a MAC mini. Turned out it was not the VM that was the problem. OS X is Extremely slow even on a system that will cost you several thousand dollars. So if I were you I'd be prepared to wait a lot. Your much better off building the app for Android, getting it working, and then when your ready build it for iOS. 
What's mean List&lt;?&gt; ?
Where can you only use a tuple and not a custom class?
Me neither, but only because you had to put up with that item1, item2 crap. Maybe now that you can assign nmaes I'll give them a shot. Seems easier than making a custom class just to have multiple return values
If you hire people fresh out of university there is nothing wrong with tests and coding "homework". They are annoying for the senior candidates.
Im sorry. Here it is: @using DutchTreat.Controllers @using DutchTreat.Data.Entities @using DutchTreat.ViewModels @addTagHelper "*, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers"
This advice is not good at all! It violates the interface segregation principle (if you like SOLID). And if you don't like it, just think about the consequences here: If you build up a chain of inheriting interfaces, you loose the advantage of *composition* but enter the nightmare of building extremely specialized hierarchies. I would take a step back and think about the *kind of behavior* you want to be able to provide independently from the specific classes. So at least there are two aspects we know about: - movement - attacking So if you want those two aspects be handled independently, just define two interfaces for this (I would strive for more expressive names that represent the meaning of the type - ``IMonster`` doesn't trigger the ability to dob*crazy attacks*) like ``IMoveable`` and ``IAttacker``. Your implementations would then implement both interfaces. In order to manage both aspects you need two separate container (Dictionaries probably) that hold the reference via the type you need for the action. So one Dictionary with all movable objects and one with all attacking objects (which might be all "monsters"). Your game algorithm the simply need to iterate through a third collection of all IDs of all entities (that said its implicitly useful to define a kind of ID for every entity) and the just lookup for each entity which possible actions it could do. 
~~Tuples~~ Dictionaries can, for the most part, be replaced with classes. Sure, slightly more difficult to implement your own Dictionary class compared to a Tuple class but at the same time you just need a class with a List&lt;T&gt; and a hashing/comparison algorithm and you're set. If you have Tuple available to you, use it.
I am on the other side of this. Love C# but with powershell I have to fight for every single line. Maybe designer had a goal to separate programmers from admins. 
Some examples where Tuples are better: * Destructuring classes is nowhere near as concise as destructuring tuples. * It's much neater to use tuples to hold intermediate values in LINQ queries than to use classes. * Tuples come with proper equality checking (I think?) that single-use classes do not.
You should learn why it is possible in Java in the first place. Then rethink.
Try @addTagHelper without the quotation marks ("...") enclosing the value. Does that work (maybe after restarting visual studio)?
&gt; We're in the south of England, don't want to give much more than that I'm afraid. Fair enough I was just curious because as others have mentioned region makes a big difference even in the UK. Agreed that there are other things which add to job value, and that's the reason I've not looked for my next step yet to be honest, when the time comes it will be a combination of I know I can earn more and I'm also ready for a new challenge. Good luck in finding your #2 dev. I hope you will call them #2 like captain Picard does to Riker by the way :)
Gotcha. That makes sense. This is why I was treading carefully :) ReactiveUI is pretty good actually. 
I interview a lot of devs. In phone screens, you will know a great or terrible candidate in the first 15 min. Great candidates are rare. Maybes are the most common. If you have time to search, don’t hire maybes.
https://i.imgur.com/DIXISMF.png Can someone help me figure out what restriction they removed? I can't quite put my finger on it...
Still doesn't work :\( I still don't have asp\- intellisense and there is no special colors for my asp\- attributes.
I had a nice use case. Basically we have a structure in the database that is a tree, and sometimes it's useful to know whether one item is a sub-item of another (at arbitrary depth). Now this is painfully inefficient in normal SQL since you basically can't do this with a single query, so caching the result would be a good thing to do. Anyway, basically items in this tree has a Guid identifier, and tuples here worked great as a cache-key: public bool IsDescendentOf(Guid parent, Guid descendent) { return (bool)cache.Get((parent, descendant), GetValue); }
Other than maybe disabling and reenabling the language services (don't know the exact name in the options right now) I don't have any other idea. Sorry
Can and should are different words for a reason.
I got 99 problems, son. Then I used regex and now I have 100.
&gt; Now this is painfully inefficient in normal SQL Look up "recursive CTE". It isn't easy to learn, but it allows this kind of query in a single request.
I've done this with VMWare before, more as a proof of concept than anything else though. I wouldn't outright recommend it though as it's against the EULA as another redditor pointed out, but what you do in your own space it up to you.
Are you sure it's the programming that is the problem? For me personally the main issue when learning to program wasn't the actual syntax or programming language itself - it was "how do I make X?", "How do I go from nothing to having working software?". This is a different skillset that many working programmers never actually face. The real problem here is problem solving. I found a good course on problem solving inside this course, look for the problem solving section:https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101
Its fine. Thank you though.
I like Mosh's approach personally as it feels more like a jump start. If you watch his lessons combined with playing around / reading the docs you really cant go wrong. If you have an understanding of software engineering but don't know the ASP.NET space, Mosh is pretty good imo.
It's actually naming them that makes me realise every single time that I should be using a data object. I started using them to return a \(bool isSuccess, string message\) response to simplify notifying errors on form submissions \- but almost immediately realised I needed to add some extra information and made a data object. I can see them used for some cases, but in almost every one I could also imagine the benefit of having some functions bundled in there too \- so x,y coords might be a good use\-case but then you could use a data object with some calculation functions instead.
By the time I've written out some names I realise it's messy and I could be encapsulating as a type Intellisense will help me with. And then when you want to make changes you don't have to change the parameter signatures of functions to do so. And in that way it was ironically adding naming that made me move away from using them.
&gt;That way, a single vehicle \(the tuple\) is passed on to the model that contains all the required bundles of data. Wouldn't an array be better? Or is there a difference?
My main problem is they make the code less readable, and if you need to change them you have to update function signatures rather than a single isolated class.
Easier to maintain? Not when changes mean updating multiple function signatures rather than 1 isolated class file that's not hurting anyone \(or requiring any more maintenance than writing a tuple\).
FWIW, you started out with: &gt; I'd like to develop an app for iOS and macOS, But you have neither a Mac nor an iPhone (or iPad). Presumably, what you want to do is create a cross-platform app that runs on iOS and macOS as a _side-effect_, but that's not going to lead to a good UX especially if you've never held such a device in your hands. &gt; I'm hoping to get by with the simulator You may have luck with Mac cloud hosting as weisshole mentioned. Something like VS App Center. &gt; Can you expand on it being a legal gray zone? I don't think EULAs are legally binding, are they? This depends a lot on the country and I am not a lawyer regardless, but you're essentially asking to run macOS and/or iOS for free, when Apple's business model largely depends on hardware (i.e., their operating system development is subsidized through hardware sales).
Running macOS on 2 GB sounds like a world of pain to me, especially for a toolchain like Xcode + Xamarin.
Breaking the EULA isn't illegal and they won't prosecute you for it. But that's not the point of the EULA. The EULA is there so that they can refuse you a service, even if you payed them for it.
You could even go one step further and write `GetAwaiter` extension methods for tuples. Then you could just write `var (a, b) = await (task1, task2)`.
Have you mapped the `Person` entity?
Sorry I actually meant 4. Plus you don’t actually run those programs when you connect to the Mac in windows. 
Do you have a dbset for person? That would seem to be the obvious problem.
Honestly, if I were in your position, I would ask the candidate to show some of his projects. As you mentioned the candidate can always copy code online, but there are tools you can use to check if his work is geniune.
That looks awesome! Got a full code sample?
Wow....I thought the salaries would be a lot higher. Honestly it seems like peanuts...
This would be a basic implementation: static class Extensions { public static TupleAwaiter&lt;T1, T2&gt; GetAwaiter&lt;T1, T2&gt;(this (Task&lt;T1&gt;, Task&lt;T2&gt;) tuple) =&gt; new TupleAwaiter&lt;T1, T2&gt;(tuple); } readonly struct TupleAwaiter&lt;T1, T2&gt; : INotifyCompletion { private readonly (Task&lt;T1&gt;, Task&lt;T2&gt;) _tuple; private readonly TaskAwaiter _awaiter; public TupleAwaiter((Task&lt;T1&gt;, Task&lt;T2&gt;) tuple) { _tuple = tuple; _awaiter = Task.WhenAll(tuple.Item1, tuple.Item2).GetAwaiter(); } public bool IsCompleted =&gt; _awaiter.IsCompleted; public void OnCompleted(Action continuation) =&gt; _awaiter.OnCompleted(continuation); public (T1, T2) GetResult() { _awaiter.GetResult(); return (_tuple.Item1.Result, _tuple.Item2.Result); } }
That seems unfairly sharp "if you have anything constructive to add". Honestly I was just surprised by the amounts - I'm from Australia and IT people were getting a LOT more than that here; hell we had "general maintenance" IT people who were not doing any development and getting 70k-90k fifteen years ago.... However that said I know there was a crash about 10 years ago because they brought in a lot of developers from overseas on 501k visas and I know salaries went down but I don't know how much... Anyway good luck perhaps this is a reasonable wage in the UK you're obviously going to have a better idea than me.
You can install macOS on any "modern" PC nowadays, i dualboot macOS/Windows 10 /r/hackintosh http://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=6288 https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/ https://www.tonymacx86.com/
OK :\) You've sold me, I'm on my way to give it a try. Thank you kindly for the leg up, really appreciate it and the background information, very helpful. I hope I can one day repay the general internet community once I master these things.
Impressive. I forgot that a few of the async/await features made use of ducktyping - it provides a lot of flexibility (to the detriment of static typing)
If by structure you mean source code: https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Windows.Forms/winforms/Managed/System/WinForms/Form.cs
You can right-click on Form and do go to definition, and it will use the meta data in the DLL to show you an outline of the class for which you dont have source available. You can also install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SchabseSLaks.Ref12 which makes show definition atually show the source code (if its on the MSDN site) for it.
Perhaps it was necessary, since other commenters have been saying the same thing, even some in the UK. If you've been having trouble finding somebody, perhaps it's because you aren't paying enough? In which case my mentioning it rather than derailing the discussion may have revealed some information for you. Perhaps instead of considering it a "flame war" you should consider it as a chance to learn; IE why you haven't been finding the people you want. Also, you seem angry in your replies to me, even though I've tried to be civil in my replies to you. That isn't very constructive. Anyway this will be my last reply. Good night and good luck.
You can grow a skill set. You can't fix an ass hole. Find a person who you think will fit with the culture and appears to have a good aptitude for learning. That mindset has always worked well for me when hiring. I look for people who do "something" outside of work - related to technology.
&gt; there are cases where tuples are the only way. This probably requires a citation. I like tuples fine, but the limitations around ValueTuples names make me kind of uncomfortable about using them across assembly bounds.
Not Xcode proper, no (assuming everything is setup correctly), but you'll still be using Xcode Tools indirectly, and you'll occasionally run into Apple's GUIs (such as Application Loader). But yeah, I suppose if you don't directly use the GUI much, 4 GB is workable.
When i copy his code, my program doesn't recognize the class "form". Do you know why ? 
This wasn't exactly my best example, it had nothing to do with monsters to be honest. I just thought, this was an easier way to tell my problem. 
so after reading the whole thread, I think your problem is OOP and static languages, not c#. think of objects like the characters in a story. you create the characters ahead of time and give them abilities (methods). the main() function is the actual story, and it executes top to bottom. there are two ways to write a story - as a gardener, or am architect. static languages lend themselves to the latter. this is why google and Microsoft have such a love for typescript as well. benefits of a dynamic language with static typing. you might (and it's rare that I say this) benefit from a little work i plain c. remember: c++ us an iteration of c. c# (or c++ ++) is an iterative improvement on c++. I've worked a fair bit in powershell, the dynamic nature of it all is probably skewing your understanding of the static types. Or maybe you just don't like them and you haven't been able to verbalize that. it's a perfectly valid viewpoint (one I disagree with personally) but for an individual project it's a bit of a wash. 
You need to have a using System.Windows.Forms; at the top of the file (alternately you can qualify Form as system.Windows.Forms.Form ) You will also need to make sure you have a reference to System.Windows.Forms.dll in your project 
Sure, as soon as you reuse a tuple elsewhere, you should look into writing your own custom class or struct. I'm still hoping for records somewhere in 8.x so classes become less boilerplate to write.
I thought so, but then I realized you lose the boolean result. One benefit of the weird Try* convention is that you can directly use (and even chain) them in `if` statements.
&gt;There are several examples of tuples in public apis. Such as?
It's Java syntax for referencing a generic type without actually specifying the concrete type parameter.

You need to remember that there is just too much out there to remember it all. Don't beat yourself up because you constantly have to google something over and over; every programmer has something ridiculous that they always have to look up. You *will* get it eventually. Just remember [Sherlock's attic](http://kaizenjournaling.com/sherlock-holmes-brain-attic/) and then read this [article](https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process?zd=1&amp;zi=etdytmyc).
Where you need dynamic data, for example Reactive Extensions.
ReactiveUI uses tuples everywhere
With ValueTuple you don't need the ItemX thing.

Hide it in a view or stored proc.
Use MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) for now. * Download and install the latest SQL Server Express (I think it's 2017). The default values in the installation prompts should be fine. * Download and install VS2017 (if you aren't using it already). * Make sure to check the box to install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) at the end of SQL Server installation. * Install SQL Server Data Tools for VS2017. * Create a new blank solution in VS2017. * Create a new SQL project (search for SQL). Look for the project type that talks about data-tier applications. The project file that is created should have the `.sqlproj` extension (you'll have to navigate to the folder of the project on disk to see its extension). * Add a table to your SQL project. For your user name and password, I would suggest naming the table `Users` that have the following columns: UserID (int), UserName (varchar(30)), Password (use [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/247304/what-data-type-to-use-for-hashed-password-field-and-what-length) to determine the appropriate data type based on your encryption algo). If you want to hash your user name as well, apply that same link to it. * Make sure your UserID is the primary key and is an **identity** column. Also, make sure that the UserName column is a unique column. In the table designer view, you can see the raw SQL that is being generated by the designer. Google how to make columns identities and unique. Be sure to use **"T-SQL"** in your google searches instead of just "SQL" so that you get answers related to T-SQL, which is the flavor of SQL that SQL Server uses (most SQL are very similar but there are syntax differences for many things). * Once you created the table to your liking, right-click on the db project and go to **Publish**. Click on the button on the top right. When the window appears, type ".\" for the instance. For the DB name, type in the name of the database. Use Windows Authentication for now. Click OK. * Uncheck register data-tier app (if checked) and click on "Advanced". Get familiar with what is in the advanced window, but uncheck "block... on possible data loss" and check "Generate smart defaults". * Save the profile and then click publish. * A window at the bottom should appear and (hopefully) it should publish successfully. * Run SSMS (you may have to search for SQL Server Management Studio). Connect to your local instance using Windows Auth. Once connected, expand "Databases" on the left and you should see your database. Expanding "Tables", you should also see your table. Right-click on the table and click on "Select 1000" or whatever. You should see that your table has no records. * Create a console program. * Google how to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE tables from C#. You'll also have to learn T-SQL/SQL at this point. * Your program should be able to 1) Create users 2) have users "login" and return a pass/fail message. This will require an INSERT SQL statement (for creating users) and a SELECT statement (for authenticating logins). *At no point should you compare plaintext passwords* -- compare the hashed passwords instead (they should be the same). Your select statement should look something like this: var selectSQL = "SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE UserName = @userName;"; Google "how to avoid SQL injection C#" or "Using SQL parameters C#" and you'll figure out how to replace @userName with the user name. Should also google "how to execute SQL queries from C#" as well :-D. Avoid Entity Framework or LINQ-to-SQL for now if you actually want to learn SQL. Hope this helps.
Why does that require tuples, though?
I'll keep this in mind, thank you!
No, it's generics. The final type gets resolved elsewhere.
Because that's how it is implemented the reactive extension api for the WhenAny methods? this.WhenAnyValue(x =&gt; x.FirstName, x =&gt; x.LastName) That returns IObservable&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;. You cannot define classed for each return type.
Why do you feel like your skills are lacking?
1 class is fine, but if you need different data types you will end with a lot of single use classes.
The website is just the paint on the car. The science/engineering is under the hood.
&gt;Wouldn't an array be better? A tuple allows you to bundle disparate pieces of data together. For example, you could have: var tuple = new Tuple&lt;string, int, List&lt;DateTime&gt;, Tuple&lt;Guid, string, string&gt;&gt;(); In this case, the tuple could hold a Base64-encoded image, an int, a list of dates and another tuple containing a list of items with their IDs (as GUIDs), names and descriptions. Passing this tuple into a ViewModel gives you a single vehicle to hold all the different items, especially if the vehicle is useful in more than one way. As an example, in creating a PDF with TuesPechkin I was able to bundle about a half dozen database-stored images that were needed within the PDF into a single tuple list List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string&gt;(mimeType, base64encoding)&gt;() and then pass that tuple list on to several different outputs, including the PDF. Without the tuple, the entire list of images would have to have been passed on to each ViewModel through the method, whereas all I have to do is call the tuple list builder from the method and then insert the resulting tuple list into the model. One vehicle instead of a half dozen.
It's gotten to the point here that your co-pay alone could break you! I had a some blood tests recently, fairly routine, but I had changed insurance and it got messed up so I was billed directly. Cost $6,143. For a *blood test* not a transfusion!
Agreed. For simple website design (AKA front end without expansive JS) I don't think I'd pay more than $15/hr - $20/hr (~$30k-$40k salary) or so.
Right on! I’ll check out Tim!
Even a simple game (and particularly an RPG) is a *major* amount of work - if they didn't give you decent resources to get started, it's a very weird task to give someone who's new to coding - which is most people in a university setting.
No thank you.

Am I the only one incredibly overwhelmed by the amount of content on screen? I know my way around the .NET ecosystem fairly well at this point and I don't even know where to begin on this site.
When you write: List\&lt;Object\&gt; list; it means that you declared list of objects \(or list of any objects deriving from Object\) however such list is invariant meaning that you cannot assign e.g. list of strings to it:List\&lt;String\&gt; listOfStrings = new ArrayList\&lt;\&gt;\(\); list = listOfStrings; // illegal List\&lt;?\&gt; is an abbreviation for List\&lt;? extends Object\&gt; and such list is covariant meaning that you can assign e.g. list of strings to it: List\&lt;?\&gt; covariantList = listOfStrings; // legal However, the restriction is that covariantList can only be used for reading data from list:covariantList.get\(0\) // legalcovariantList.add\("new value"\) // illegalThe reason is if you could add items to covariant list you could easily break type safety:List\&lt;String\&gt; listOfStrings = new ArrayList\&lt;\&gt;\(\);List\&lt;?\&gt; covariantList = listOfStrings;covariantList.add\(2\); // now listOfStrings would contain integer \- and we didn't even do any casts \- that would be a hole in type safety There is also generic contravariance meaning that you could downcast generic types but contravariant type could only be used for consuming objects of the generic type \(they can be used as input parameters\). Here is an example when contravariance could be useful:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3861132/how\-would\-contravariance\-be\-used\-in\-java\-generics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3861132/how-would-contravariance-be-used-in-java-generics) If you want to know more look up Java generic covariance and contravariance. Note that in C# generics are also invariant by default and you could mark interfaces as covariant or contravariant by putting "in" or "out" next to generic type \(IEnumerable\&lt;out T\&gt; is an example \- that's why it is valid to cast e.g. IEnumerable\&lt;string\&gt; to IEnumerable\&lt;object\&gt;\)
You'll do grand :)
Gj Dave, I see that it's finally finished. I remember seeing a tweet about the early stages of this site a long time ago. :) Site looks good, do you update it manually, or are you fetching articles and so on from other sites automatically? One slight problem for me is that the header kinda flickers and moves a bit up/down when changing page, problably because of image sizes and so on? Also, are you doing a full page reload when routing instead of using Vue's router?
What's with the Java style open braces on the same line and using statements inside the namespace? Why would they not follow C# conventions when sharing C# code?
This was a few years ago so it might. 
It's from 1999, maybe it just predates "modern" .NET conventions?
From my own experience: - Learning a slightly lower level programming language might help you to understand C#. When I was first learning OOP in Java (similar to C#), I already knew C and some assembly language, and so I understood the stack and the heap, which are critical to understand in any imperative language. When I realised that instantiating a class was just a way of allocating a struct on the heap, but with a much more advanced and well organised type system than C could ever have. If you understand that a value is a variable on the stack, passing by value copies things on to the top of the stack for the function call, reference types are like pointers on the stack to objects on the heap, etc, it becomes easy to visualize. - You might want to do a basic course on data structures and their associated algorithms. Even if you never implement your own data structures and only use the built in generic collections, it becomes so much easier to intuitively build the data model that your software uses. The basic ones are queues, stacks, singly or doubly linked lists, resizable arrays, binary trees / red black trees, and hash-based structures (dictionaries). You don't even need to know exactly how they work, just a vague idea, along with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation of adding/removing/searching each.
I definitely don't want to be too down on it because I respect anyone who tries to do something for the community, but I think a compact view \(maybe as an option\) would be a good thing, especially if it's frequently updated. I like what this guy does for Xamarin: [https://links.danrigby.com/](https://links.danrigby.com/page2/) Easy to see everything quickly, so I can tell if there's something I want to read.
What is it?
Four columns is at least two too many. The view I get when making the window narrow enough that only one column fits is a _much_ easier read. Make it, at most, one main column and a sidebar with tangential content (smaller text and/or lower-contrast colors). I also don't know what all this stuff is. What's a project? How do news differ from discoveries? Or issues vs. help wanted?
First, all code turns to shit over time. the good programmers learn how to slow that rot and the great ones learn how to only work on greenfield projects. Let me start again, I saw a joke and went for it. Don't beat yourself up over the quality of your code. I'm guessing you're not actually able to assess its quality but are getting headfucked by what you've written. This is absolutely normal. The real trick here is to trust that if you keep at it you will find a better solution, or at least a solution that works. If someone is actively criticising your work then we have a different problem. If their feedback is negative but doesn't provide any guidance on improving, fuck em. They are not your enemy, they're just noise. If they're giving feedback and guidance but you don't understand the guidance, then ask for some clarification. I give advice all the time. Sometimes the things I want to describe are perfectly clear in my head, but when I engage the mouth it comes out like a jigsaw. Anyway, for code, step one is make it work, step two is make it beautiful. If you're writing tests then that process changes slightly. Also remember that all big problems can be broken down into lots of little problems. Each time you find a problem that you feel is beyond you, break it down into smaller chunks. Repeat and repeat until you get to something you can literally just google. Over time you'll still break the problem down, but it won't require so much google-fu. Stay positive, don't compare yourself to others around you and judge your code (for now) by whether it works.

Just keep going, unfortunately your code will always be terrible in 6 months time! I have been professionally programming 7 years now and the amount of time I look at old code and think there was a much better way of doing that! 
You should probably work on a couple console applications to get the hang of C# before you try using C# to write Modules for powershell, only because writing modules for powershell is a subclass of writing c# (like trying to learn to snorkel before learning to swim). Since you used to writing power shell you likely already have at least a cursory knowledge of some of the core basics... Programmers Guide to c# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/ C# Reference https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878342(v=vs.85).aspx MSDN Cmdlett example https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878342(v=vs.85).aspx Looking at the example commandlet, it looks fairly strait forward... the 'most advanced' thing I see is the function attributes ( the part in brackets just before the method signatures) but honestly attributes are pretty strait forward and they are likely more confusing for people when they first encounter them after being experienced in languages that don't have them then they are for people who are not previously experienced with other languages. Looking at the Programming guide... in my opinion, I would rate the sections in tiers of importance.. Tier I &lt;basics, things that will exist in pretty much every c# program&gt; Statements, expressions and operators Types Classes and Structs Arrays Strings Properties Namespaces Tier II &lt;Still pretty basic, but requires understanding of the basics&gt; Interfaces Enumeration Types Indexers Iterators Nullable Types, Collections Exceptions and Exception Handling File System and the Registry Tier III &lt;Starting to get a bit more flexible with where you put your code and how it gets activated&gt; Delegates Events Lambda Expressions Linq Query Expressions Generics Tier IV &lt;Stuff that only tends to come into play in more complex execution environments&gt; Application Domains Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache (You may need to hit this one sooner working with commandletts though).

This site has been quite useful to me. http://regexstorm.net/ Also... you should really try to avoid using the goto keyword. It is proably the quickest and easiest way to make your logic completely unreadable. 
Simple game compared to GTA5??? Beginner programmer??? *Does not compute*

Isn't this just a failing of being able to break down your big problem into a series of smaller problems? I am having this problem with a junior at the moment that they struggle with 'a big problem' that is actually a set of smaller problems. Your first problem? How do I relate checkboxes to their parents? Your second problem? How do I project this relationship onto the page.
You're not wrong. I took a quick look, but the issues are deeper than I can troubleshoot. Opened an issue here if anyone wants to take a look: https://github.com/daveaglick/discoverdotnet/issues/44
I can tell you what the issue likely is as I've run into it myself with Vue. Since you're not using a transpiler, you need to write your Vue app code in IE compliant javascript. Just open up the page in IE with the console debugger open. It shouldn't be too big of an issue to solve what needs to be changed.
just keep learning and practicing. I thought I was awesome after a year or two. 10 years of experience later and I laugh at how little I knew. Don't hold yourself to standards that you cannot possibly achieve in any reasonable capacity.

&gt; DTO A DTO is simply a poco without no logic, used exclusively for data transfer between layers. I strictly use EF Entities and View Models as DTOs. I'm more flexible on the Domain models though, if its required. Usually I don't have domain models unless theres a tangible benefit, such as the example above with MarketCatalogueModel. Other cases for domain models is a data resultset from multiple sources, or a business object that is difficult to represent as multiple entity models (which itself is a smell that there should be data optimization). But, if i DO have a data model, I usually go: * Controller calls Service to fetch data * Service calls DAL * DAL Returns Entity DTOs to Service * Service returns Domain Models to controller (compiled Entity DTOs from multiple sources, logics, etc) * Controller perhaps calls another service (to perform some logic, business validation validation etc), passing in Domain Model * Service perhaps returns boolean of validated, or nothing if mutator * Controller returns ViewModel as automapped Domain model 
Am I missing something because I can't quite see the benefit in your proposal? I'm not very seasoned in C# so that might well be the case. Is there a problem in bools in terms of efficiency compared to bipolar enums? 
While the answer to your question is "A regular expression" - it's fundamentally the wrong way to go about it. You need to instead be taking steps to isolate your users data from what are parameters that are used for work. So you shouldn't generally be taking something as input and feeding it directly as a command line parameter for example. Instead you should turn the users intent into data, and then the data into a set of command line arguments. This will likely include escaping certain characters so they are used verbatim as a separate sanitization step.
Whatever the UK average is, you will always be competing with London in terms of graduate developers. Its like a brain black hole, and any young developer will gravitate there immediately as they're willing to relocate to somewhere where if it doesn't work out, there's opportunity. Also, if you're the sole developer in a growing company of 25 people, I'd be cautious moving there and as its not in the vicinity of other jobs I'd be doubly cautious. Its a crap situation, but one borne from the IT market, namely HR departments and IT Managers farming out recruitment to Agencies, which will always try and get their clients the highest possible wage. I would just take a chance on one of the CVs, have them in for a week paid work, and just chew through the candidates and have a tight onboarding plan. Basically, if you're not Brighton, Manchester or London you've got an uphill struggle to get Junior devs at any price.
...14% increase in wages since last year, that should really be telling you something (as well as the almost 30k gap between 10th and 90th percentile. Look at the other jobs advertised in your area. If they are a handful then that cost will only rise further next year.
Bool params are problematic. This becomes more apparent once you add a second bool param to your method signature: now you’re calling the method as `.Foo(true, false);` True what? False what? In contrast, two enum params would be far more expressive and often self-explanatory.
Just wondering where these enums are going to be namespaced for the purposes of calling the function? var myClass = new MyClass(); myClass.MyMethod(MyClass.SomeOption.Two); Seems janky.
Since this really doesn't add any functionality and just makes it so you can "inline" an enum, I'm inclined to disagree. It makes the code harder to read, not easier. I also don't come across the need for one time use enums often - it feels like a bit of a code smell. It might also encourage you to make methods do more than perhaps a single method should.
I know, right?! Not even a “make me an offer” link or anything.
Books make sense when you have binary options. Defining a type in-line seems gross to me. If it’s public you’d still be able to use it other places anyway which would be gross too. 
I’m not the original poster, FWIW. I’m just explaining why even a very simple enum can be preferable over a bool.
Admittedly, this is minorly alleviated by using named parameters.
I considered mentioning those, yeah.
&gt;[Bools] make sense when you have binary options. Not always. I've used an enum for "sort ascending" / "sort descending" because if I had used a `bool`, then you wouldn't know what `Sort(true)` did. You could hope that all callers will say `Sort(descending: true)`, but why not just make it harder to write it obscurely than to write it clearly?

You will always have two different concerns going on - what works best for your UI and what works best for your data store. They will never be in agreement. You will definitely end up having data structures that closely model your data store. So wouldn't it make sense that you would also have data structures that closely model your UI? Why should one have any priority over the other. By forcing your UI to match your data store, you will compromise your UI. By forcing your data store to match your UI, you will compromise your data store. So you need to have two sets of data structures, granted they will have a lot of overlap. Some overlap might make sense (enums?), but generally you will need to write that boilerplate code that converts from one to the other. Some people do it by hand, some use automappers. But in the end, you'll be glad you kept those two concerns separated.
Ah, in that case you're probably going to want to define exactly what are valid inputs rather than trying to anticipate all the ways they could introduce malicious or malformed commands. For each valid command (ping, and whatever else you may want) consider what options you want to allow (perhaps you want -i and -c but not -l, or perhaps everything) and define valid inputs for those too. Parse the input, read the valid parts, form your own command from them and then pass that on to the console. If I'm misunderstanding and all you want to do is to allow "ping xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" a pretty simple regex *should* be enough (though you'd probably still be safer to decompose the whole thing). @"^ping ((?:[\d]{1,3}\.){3}[\d]{1,3})$" should match only valid inputs, but I recommend you test it thoroughly yourself. 
What do you mean by "change raw mouse input?" It would be helpful if you gave us an idea of what you're trying to accomplish with the mouse.
Ah, ok, so you want to _simulate_ raw mouse input. Gotcha. This might help: https://stackoverflow.com/q/18378142/2324316
This is nice, but as a work around for unreadable code, like SomeMethod(true, false, false, true), I do SomeMethod(boldFont: true, useTemplate: false, isAsync: false, imrunningoutofideas: true). It also protects against your intern adding a parameter in the middle causing all callers to have out-of-order parameters.
As is tradition..
The problem with this is sometimes two options are incompatible. Enum provides a mutually exclusive choice. I personally love his idea.
Just a heads up, the developer levels go as follows, * Junior Dev \- Needs to be given specific tasks to follow. Needs significant mentorship and guidance. Can take up to 6 months to get up to speed and become proficient. * Mid\-level Dev \- Follows semi\-specific tasks well and is able to expand beyond that to a limited degree. This is your goto for someone who you want that is both productive and will stick with the company at a higher but reasonable cost. * Senior Dev \- Is proficient in the tech stack and needs limited supervision if any to remain productive. Can handle a broad scope of work and is often many times as productive as a junior or mid\-level dev. Only hire a junior dev if you are looking for someone to do basic tasks and are willing to put in quite a bit of training. If you hire someone as a junior dev who is beyond this level, expect them to find a much better paying job within a year or two. You will get what you pay for.
Every time I read from a ftp stream I do not have access to stream length or position. It is a all or nothing read. Seems like you are experiencing the same thing.

A simple RPG, hmm.. A text adventure is a role playing game. It would be relatively easy to create an engine that handled moving around using grid based coordinates, and loading a "room" based on the grid location from a data structure. It would offer good areas for encapsulation, things like * Player object - coords, inventory, etc * Room object - description, where walls/doors are, any items * Text Parser - simple commands like "look", "north", "south" etc. Try and take each development opportunity to improve your code and try new things. For example, IoC and Dependency Injection and unit tests. Read up on clean coding patterns. Have you heard of Uncle Bob ? Also - what parts of this assignment do you "hate"? Hope this helps in some way.
Because it's old software. The more people that moves away from it the happier MS will be. IE is basically just for supporting old software now that MS is focusing on Edge instead 
I think it varies by how you manage your messages, but I'd probably put it under publish subscribe pattern. It's common for messengers to want to listen to only a subset, so why waste resources and deliver everything to everyone. In part we get around this with multiple messengers which could be described as top level topcs, then each client of that messenger can subscribe to more fine grained sub topics. So Publish Subscribe is my closest guess. It doesn't quite describe cases where you are direct messaging using addresses and return messengers/addresses, but there are more in PEEA or EIP that would cover the case. They're books, I always forget the actual names, but google will tell you.
Oh please yes, that would be so much less overhead. Look, here's what I often use: Parameter classes, mostly as subclasses on the same level as the method using it. Sure this has other implications regarding extensibility but it's not exactly a quick write-up every time, at least not without custom snippets. Anywhere, it looks like this: public class SomeClass { public class SomeMethodParams { public enum SomeOption { OptionOne, OptionTwo, OptionThree } public SomeOption SomeOptionParam { get; set; } // etc other props } public void SomeMethod(SomeMethodParams input) { switch(input.SomeParam) { case SomeMethodParam.SomeOption.OptionOne: // Do stuff break; case SomeMethodParam.SomeOption.OptionTwo: // Do stuff break; case SomeMethodParam.SomeOption.OptionThree: // Do stuff break; default: // Do stuff break; } } Then when calling the Class' Method elsewhere it looks like this: var params = new SomeClass.SomeMethodParams { SomeOptionParam = SomeClass.SomeOption.OptionTwo }; SomeClass.SomeMethod(params); Unless I write the thing as an inline abomination I tend to also derive the Parameter Class from IDisposable and then wrap the params in a using block, so I don't clutter up memory. I know. Haha, C#. Om nom nom RAM. 
Clunky, named parameters are nicer. But how about improving this in the tooling instead? 1. You write in the booleans and ctrl+. automatically generates the named arguments. 2. Provide the compiler with a way to read definition of allowed parameters. Maybe something akin to how ASP.NET does it.
0 means that strings are the same in given culture
I'd wager those places only need a Junior/Mid level with the occasional oversight from a Senior.
The Compare method returning an int might be something that comes from the C/C++ world. You might want to use "string.Equals" instead. bool quitting = false; foreach (string term in terms) { if (string.Equals(line, term, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) { quitting = true; } } Also note that the alias "string" is preferred over "String". You can also simplify your code using Linq extensions. var quitting = terms.Any(term =&gt; string.Equals(line, term, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
[`String.Compare`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zkcaxw5y%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) is used for sorting strings. For pure equivalence you can use the `==` operator. For contingent equivalence use [`String.Equals`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c64xh8f9%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).
TriedString.Trim?
Whitelist, don't blacklist. Basically this means that instead of trying to define what's forbidden (inevitably getting something wrong because there will **always** be something you didn't think of) you define explicitly what's allowed - the bare minimum of it. Putting commands together based on user input is a terrible risk and you either need to offload the sanitization to something you can trust or be *extremely* stringent. There are solutions for SQL, XML, HTML etc. because these are very common targets for the same injection vulnerabilities you're worrying about. Shell commands are nowhere near as commonly used (because the ramifications of getting it wrong are scary) and I think you might have a hard time finding a "boxed" solution. For example, if you're trying to parse an IP address - don't. IPAddress.Parse already does it, and your implementation will usually either be worse or at least waste your time.
A database way to think about it is that an array, list, etc. is two (or more) rows of the same column, whereas a tuple is two (or more) columns of the same row.
It's even worse than that. What if this is being called from a private method? Does the inlined enum inherit the accessibility modifier from its context?
