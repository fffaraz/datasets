Agreed. You wouldn't learn something like this by just reading documentation about data types.
Here take a look at [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_arrays.htm) about arrays.
&gt; Also, do you think it'd be beneficial to back up events in SQL Server? uhh.. not back up. try primary storage. Do not rely on data in Redis being durable.
Lemme be clear, I know what an array is. My problem was that how to put an array in an object was very hard to find answers for, because everywhere I searched thought I was asking for the opposite (arrays of objects).
Well it would work exactly the same as putting any other type as an object property, except it's now an array
Thank you for the help, and for the comment chain. I'll implement the change and hope it works.
In java script you can just declare a var object = {array: []}; You cant do this in c# because it's not an interpretive language. Its strongly typed and compiled before runtime. Create a class with a property with an array. Although you want a list for what it looks like you're doing. Google search is going to be your most important tool as a programmer. Search up list examples.
Performance gains from operating on contiguous blocks of memory with arrays of structs can be a reason to break those guidelines.
I think you could make it less awkward by just having it return after the mitigation instead of dealing with the boolean at all.
I assume timer\_tick is called every frame? You will need to get delta time (should be pretty trivial using built in functions) Now save your current velocity: v = deltaX/deltaTime When the user isnt't moving the picture box update position as xNew = xOld + velocity\*deltaTime
Kinda. dotNET Core has everything almost self contained. You'll have C#and ASP.NET at the backend. In the frontend, depending how you initially configure your project or you set it up later, you'll have Bootstrap, Angular or React. As for the database, you have a little more room. By default, it has SQL Server and SQLite. But it can be configured for other databases.
It mostly matters in performance-sensitive areas. ValueTypes (like structs) are passed "on the stack". Classes are passed "by reference" on the heap. The stack is where your executable code lives in memory. The heap is "that big bucket of memory over there". On the stack: A copy of the entire struct/int/long is placed in memory close^* to the function when it is called. By reference: A pointer to the object is passed to the function, and that pointer is somewhere off in main memory, possibly "far away". For deeply-nested object hierarchies, it would be disastrous to pass an copy of that to the function each time, because copying memory takes time. For simple structures, it's far faster to pass the entire value directly to the function, because running off to main memory to fetch data has a significant base cost/latency. Nowadays, CPUs have big caches, so for small-to-medium objects, it really doesn't make much of a difference in most situations like web services. However, games and heavy-duty data processing do benefit by careful choice of struct vs. class.
As I'd mentioned, you want to publish all of your events to a pub/sub system. In that case, you'd have a listener subscribe to all the deposit/withdrawl events published in the system. You update the total as new events come in. Sure, if this were a new feature you'd have to load up the whole stream of all events and build it up (usually, you are maintaining said stream as its own projection, so you can bulk load/query it for just the events you want, or the events you've missed). But, that only happens once, when you start it the first time. Because this "total of all deposits/withdrawls" would be a "Query" in the CQRS model - something that you only "Read" (as a user of the system), you can just store that total in a table somewhere, and update it as new events are published. It might be a few seconds out of sync with the system of record for all accounts, but you don't use that value to determine if commands are valid (like, there's no "Withdrawl all money from all accounts in the bank" command, and if there were, it would iterate through each account, not just say "look at the total and withdraw that amount") In terms of keeping a queryable "master" stream of all the events, that's actually a feature of a lot of cloud pub/sub services... or, at least, it's a feature of Azure's.
&gt; While code reuse has been commonly promoted as a universal good over most of the history of computer science, it comes at an increased cost of change &amp; replacement. In order to rewrite a bit of code, one must ensure the rewrite will satisfy its contract with all of its callers. Code that's only used once is, therefore, the easiest to change or replace—it only needs to be tested for one use.
PostgreSQL and MySQL are both pretty popular in the .NET world. Oracle appears sometimes, but Oracle the company has been dragging their feet on giving us a good Oracle DB driver for .NET Core.
Seeing as dotNET is a strong direct competitor, no wonder. PostgreSQL and MySQL are not surprising. Solid databases.
But .NET isn't a competitor for Oracle DB; it's a complement. And they are the ones who made the MySQL driver. No, something else must be going on.
Sorry, I meant dotNET is a direct competitor to Java EE. By dragging their feet on the Oracle driver, it gives users less reasons to explore dotNET. The main reason I think dotNET is attacking Java EE is the ease of integrating dotNET sites to existing authentication services, particularly Office 365 Business.
As far as I can tell from the posted code, you can restructure this a lot by extracting the double loop into a function. for example ``` public Iterator&lt;Point&gt; getPoints (shipGrid) { for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength (0); posY++) { for (int posX = 0; posX &lt; shipGrid.GetLength (1) / 2; posX++) { yield return new Point (posX, posY) } } } ```
I find it funny that it's "monolithic and container" as if the two terms are somehow opposed.
You’re getting two things confused. Singleton, Scoped, &amp; Transient prefixes relate to the lifetime of a dependency in the DI The IHostedService interface is for hosting a service that starts &amp; shares lifetime with your application process. Check out the link the user above posted.
Yea, but they don't really make money on Java EE. Their profits, as I understand it, are from the database, COTS software, and consulting.
That’s a different thing. It sends packets with no data periodically to keep routers from dropping your connection.
Thank you, that gives me a good set of stuff to pursue and learn. I've taken a course in databases, focus was on Oracle, so happy to know the SQL practice will come to use.

I strongly disagree. Structs are a vey good match for types representing values. Furthermore *wrapping* primitive types in domain specific value types (think EmployeeId, ZipCode, Price) can prevent errors and increases discoverability.
I usually use [Microsoft's Northwind or Pubs databases](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=23654).
The first one is only one aspect of being a coder, the second one is only a select sample size... let me guess, you’re Chinese?
But seriously, that can be useful in such situations. Labeled breaks would be even better, but C# doesn’t have those.
Aspirin Minds is an Indian company that sells pre-interview assessment services to Indian employers. They have an interest in portraying Indian graduates as bad as possible so that Indian companies and foreign companies operating in India buy their pre-interview assessment services. I work for a Danish company with operations in both Denmark and India and I would say 80% of new Danish graduates are employable while the percentage for Indian graduates is much lower at maybe at 20%. That is low but still way higher than the 3%-5% Aspirin Minds claim "can code". Also I believe Aspirin Minds is bullshiting about having tested that many engineers in India, China and the US. Even pollsters have a hard time conducting Yes/No polls from a fraction of that many people. Aspirin Minds want us to believe that they conducted in-depth coding assessments of that many people.
&gt; I thought Generics and type &lt;T&gt; is all about that I can store a int or a double in it ? No. T has to be a particular type, at runtime.
&gt; oke, so I have to make a class No, the assignment says create a stack object (instance), not a new class. That’s not how I read it.
&gt; I believe this can be accomplished with two invocations of SelectMany on ‘data’ Yeah, looks that way. Something like data.SelectMany(kvp1 =&gt; { var values = kvp1.SelectMany(kvp2 =&gt; new { Quarter = kvp.Key, Value }); return new { Category = kvp1.Key, values.Select(v =&gt; v.Quarter), values.Select(v =&gt; v.Value); }) I don’t think those Select calls are quite right though.
public List&lt;float&gt; GoodInput { get; set; }
That’s mildly interesting, but also pointless. There is no such thing as concurrent access to a file stream. *Any* attempt to shoehorn it will be a footgun.
You get what you pay for. There are very good Indian coders, and they're expensive. There are very good Chinese coders, and they're expensive. "Let's outsource to Country X because they're cheap!" is a recipe for finding shitty coders. Come to think of it, "let's outsource", period, is a recipe for finding shitty coders.

Hi, I apologies in advance for such a silly question. However, I'm learning C#, and I'm curious what the difference between C# and .NET.
Any answers anyone? Any help is really appreciated
&gt;The first one is only one aspect of being a coder And what's wrong with it? there's no perfect way to compare developers on such a big scale, so we can only use this things &gt;let me guess, you’re Chinese? Nope
Outsourcing has its place I think. It's a tool that can be utilized correctly imo
Did you even read the article?
I did
Yes. You can get the property by string name using: &amp;#x200B; `typeof(Order).GetProperty("NetAmount").GetValue(obj);` &amp;#x200B; You'll need to cast the value from Object to the correct type too.
This is the best definition I've heard yet. Usually people try to explain the technical reasons why you might use one over another, but this makes a lot more sense.
Hi thanks for that. I'd prefer to use the Linq to XML, so had a quick read. I can get the xml text loaded, and then tried: IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; partNos = from item in orderDetails.Descendants("Account") select (string)item.Attribute("Type"); (Type is an attribute of Account:) &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt; &lt;Body&gt; &lt;Orders&gt; &lt;Customer&gt; &lt;Internal_Object_Id&gt;eaf2442lfcc741ac8a73cdb62b46a368&lt;/Internal_Object_Id&gt; &lt;External_Object_Id /&gt; &lt;CompanyName&gt;Acme LTD&lt;/CompanyName&gt; &lt;Account&gt; &lt;Type&gt;Cash&lt;/Type&gt; &lt;CreditLimit&gt;0.00&lt;/CreditLimit&gt; &lt;AvailableCredit&gt;0.00&lt;/AvailableCredit&gt; &lt;OnStop&gt;false&lt;/OnStop&gt; &lt;DiscountGroup&gt;STD&lt;/DiscountGroup&gt; &lt;DisplayExVAT&gt;false&lt;/DisplayExVAT&gt; &lt;/Account&gt; .... But it always returns null. I've tried getting root elements as well, but they also return null.
pay peanuts, get monkeys, regardless of nation
Ah...it was the namespace. I've declared the namespace and now I can actually see the results, and the possible results in boolean properties...but, now the "typeof" and GetType(), both return the xml namespace as the type and not the actual data type of the property from the model.
Hmm sees like a good way, but i dont properly understand it, it may sound stupid but would you be able to rephrase it a bit easier? I've tried the following: private bool GetSpotForSpecialContainer(Container container, int posY) { for (int posX = 0; posX &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(1) / 2; posX++) { if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; HasEntrance(posY, posX)) { AddValueLeftSide(container); return true; } } return false; } private void CalcSpecialContainers() { foreach (Container container in specialContainers) { bool isAdded = false; if (leftSideWeight &lt;= rightSideWeight) { for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++) { GetSpotForSpecialContainer(container, posY); } if (GetSpotForSpecialContainer(container, posY) break; } else if (rightSideWeight &lt; leftSideWeight) { for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++) { for (int posX = shipGrid.GetLength(1) / 2; posX &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(1); posX++) { if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; HasEntrance(posY, posX)) { shipGrid[posY, posX].addContainer(container); AddValueRightSide(container); isAdded = true; break; } } if (isAdded) break; } } } }
You might still need to follow the "under 16 bytes" rule though. Otherwise the defensive copy the compiler makes when accessing the strict from the array might cost more than the indirection of a class reference. As always, profile, benchmark, measure and compare.
How you handle the outsourcing is also very important. If you make the outsourcing partner the owner and stakeholder of the project (like Hertz did with Accenture recently), then you are bound to be doomed.
You are not going to solve the problem unless you agree that it exists
In my experience, it depends on the business you're doing business with. Accenture is in the business of producing billable hours. Vaguely working code is sometimes a side-effect of that.
Sorry for long delay. You seem to have good understanding of programming, which is kind of the same situation I was when I wanted to learn c#. &amp;#x200B; So what worked really well for me was: &amp;#x200B; 1. I read this book called [Learn C# in One Day](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Hands-Project-Coding-Project-ebook/dp/B016Z18MLG), and even though the book is really small, I strongly believe you'll learn a lot about c#, especially the syntax. &amp;#x200B; 2. Next you can tap into more complex topics. For example: \- You can test your knowledge with writing some sample project, like calculator or something else. \- Maybe you need to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) (you said you are into web dev), if so you can search for [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) tutorials on Youtube or Pluralsight, and I am sure you'll be able to follow them. \- You can practice on [codewars.com](https://codewars.com), very nice for learning if you haven't heard of it. \- What I personally love doing, is to download free complete projects written by other developers and study their code.
Thanks for the advice 👍
Terrible programmers aren't going to be hitting Hackerrank or competing in development Olympics. Not representative
Happy to be corrected, but I don't *think* that you get any copying when accessing a struct in an array, though you do with any other collection like a List. So if you have a struct MyStruct with a mutable int field Val that is set in the constructor, then: collection[0] = new MyStruct(5); collection[0].Val = 6; Console.WriteLine(collection[0].Val); Will output 6 if collection is an array, but 5 if it is a List.
When I Google "best programmers by country" the top site points to China having the best programmers, followed by Russia.
I'm starting to think that what I'm trying to do just isn't possible. I can't seem to get any semblance of sense out of it. I've tried the gettype, but keep getting errors, I've tried the linq to xml but that either doesn't return anything, or returns an enumeration that I can't iterate around. It's confusing as hell, and I'm not getting the results that they seem to on the microsoft site. They get a list of things back, whereas I'm just seeing a chunk of xml.
 data.SelectMany(x =&gt; x.Value.Select(y =&gt; new { outerKey = x.Key, innerKey = y.Key, value = y.Value }) Just FWIW.
It sounds like racism.
do not suspect another that he is Chinese so that he does not suspect you /The Holy Bible
Research like this is useless. You still have to vet developers one by one. The nationility of a developer is not an indicator of anything.
Thus, average not-terrible programmer from china is better than indian, usa, and so on?
&gt; in the business of producing billable hours. Vaguely working code is sometimes a side-effect of that. These are such soul crushing jobs...
I company I used to consult for decided to outsource half of the developers from another European country not too far away; many where great programmers but the language barrier was a huge issue. Long story short; Communicating complex domain knowledge from one type of poor school-English to another is a recipe for disaster.

Naming things can be one of the hardest things about developing software (or any technology/concept, really).
Test explorer seems about the same? Or are you talking about r#
I'll give it a whirl but worried about cost
I would avoid Oracle, using dotnet. Not sure whether it's the two companies not playing well or an inherent limitation in one of the platforms, but the two just kinda suck together. Most other databases are fine, though. Even Mongol works well. To your original question, dotnet straight up replaces Express and Node in the MEAN/MERN stack. You can use ASP.NET to replace Express, but you can also just grab Angular, as well.
I don't think you can conclude that either. I suspect there are complicated selection factors that skew who does and does not participate in Hackerrank and development Olympics. Things like "Is Hackerrank advertised in all listed countries? Does Hackerrank have a similar uptake from advertisement in all listed countries? Are the motivations behind participation similar in all listed countries? Is Hackerrank available in the primary language for developers in all listed countries?" I suspect the answer to at least one (and perhaps most) of the above questions is "No", and that's just the ones I could think of off the top of my head. And all of this is setting aside the question of whether Hackerrank participants are representative of the set of not-terrible programmers within any individual country.
If you want good advice you should specify if you're looking to learn back end (ASP.NET/C#) or front end work (JS - React/Angular/Vue/etc), or maybe even design work since you mentioned CSS. You can choose to learn it all, but doing it all at once will be overwhelming. I'll assume you're looking for back end since you're asking on /r/csharp. Just a tip, you should be looking to learn ASP.NET Core with .NET core. Microsoft has said that Core is the future of their product. Existing apps in Framework are similar enough to Core that you'll pick them up trivially. Are you studying independently or in a university/school? If the latter, check with your school whether they have a subscription to Pluralsight you can use (or if they offer a discount). I've tried a few different resources and nothing has come even remotely close to Pluralsight in either quality of content nor polish and user experience. If you do get a subscription, go with any of Scott Allen's beginner level courses, he is a phenomenal teacher and really knows what he's talking about. Then again, I'm also that guy who simply doesn't learn programming from reading books, yet many people will swear by books. Everyone's different. If you're into books, I can recommend "C# in Depth" by Jon Skeet for general C#, since Jon Skeet is a god of the C# world. Unfortunately I don't know what the good ASP.NET books are.
C# can... * ...natively execute powershell scripts * ...dynamically generate and load an assembly and execute code within said assembly during runtime * ...dynamically create and execute expression trees I am not saying C# will fulfill every possible use case (we know it doesn't), but I've only come across a few instances where the complexity of modeling a solution in C# was high enough that developing and using something that functionally amounts to a **domain-specific language (DSL)** could be reasonably considered as an alternative.
Isn't the deeply nested struct only going to copy the top layer assuming it is using classes underneath?
True. Yet this looks teams compared to what is seen in the field. 😱
The official Oracle Java SDK is a paid product for commercial purposes. They've handed over OpenJDK to Redhat/IBM and walked away.
Love that expression. I wonder if it could be extracted into an extension method. 🤔
Aren't `readonly struct` and `ref` locals/`in` parameters used exactly for this purpose, to prevent defensive copies, esp of larger structs? Though that does require you to be OK with an immutable struct.
Use the two-parameter overload of `SelectMany` (that one is used by the query syntax for efficiency, as well). IEnumerable&lt;(string outerKey, string innerKey, int innerValue)&gt; Foo( Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; data) { return data.SelectMany( outerKV =&gt; outerKV.Value, (outerKV, innerKV) =&gt; (outerKey: outerKV.Key, innerKey: innerKV.Key, innerValue: innerKV.Value)); } I'd also recommend using a `ValueTuple` as I did above instead of anonymous types unless you actually need them. * They are value types, avoiding unnecessary allocations * Have a name and thus can be passed outside the method * Reduce binary size because the compiler doesn't have to generate a new type for it
The road to madness and despair is paved with mutable structs.
Yes backend. I'm studying independently. Thank you.
Microsoft have 2 you can download. I think they are; Worldwideimports and Adventure works

If you're into books, I can recommend "C# in Depth" by Jon Skeet for general C#, since Jon Skeet is a god of the C# world. Unfortunately I don't know what the good ASP.NET books are. I'm with you on that, I've been learning for a few years in spare time, I've actually been learning [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) recently. I've never been good learning from a book, the best teacher I found was a source code I understood and good old google, from there I found it much easier to understand what was actually going on (it's an emulated game I played as a young teen, in C# using DirectX SDK June2010), all OOP. Stepping to [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) wasn't as overwhelming as I had first thought, although I had taken a course off udemy to get to grips with parts I hadn't learnt (see below), if you know enough about C# in general, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) isn't as bad as you may think. The one part I lack on right know (which I'm studying here an there) is javascript, not being a web developer I neglected to learn something I wouldn't have used till that point. Styling, well lets just say I can only assume people have more artistic talents in their pinky toes than I have as a whole.
C# is a programming language, while .NET is a framework. You can find some explanations here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2724864/what-is-the-difference-between-c-sharp-and-net](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2724864/what-is-the-difference-between-c-sharp-and-net)

Ok so.net is an extension to c# much like how jQuery is too JavaScript?
&gt; And because Position property is of type long the read operation could yield some very weird results on a 32-bit platform for files larger than 2Gb. Isn't this limitation only true for memory, rather than files?
More like this: ``` private void AddzSpecialContainers(logger) { foreach (Container container in specialContainers) { if(leftSideWeight &gt; rightSideWeight) continue; if(TryAddContainer(container, shipGrid)) { logger.Debug("Added {container.Name}. Yeah baby!"); }; } } private bool TryAddContainer(Container container, ShipGrid shipGrid) { int roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX = shipGrid.GetLength(1) / 2; for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++) { for (int posX = 0; posX &lt; roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX; posX++) { if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; HasEntrance(posY, posX)) { shipGrid[posY, posX].addContainer(container); AddValueLeftSide(container); return true; } } } return false; } ``` You don't have to return a value. Just use return; Also, not very nice but this is possible too: ```for (int posY = 0; !isAdded &amp;&amp; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++)```
No, jQuery is a library. .NET is more like a platform, which includes a runtime enivronment and a library. And .NET is not only for C#, it can also work with VB and F# languages.
I wonder how the openssl -K argument orders bytes of the key. Is 0x27 the first byte (lowest address)? If not, then your key is ordered wrong in your c# code.
There were some benchmarks posted to this subreddit recently. Not going to spend too much time looking for them. Here is the Microsoft documentation stating Ordinal comparision is the fastest string comparison method. Second paragraph in the Ordinal section. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings#ordinal-string-operations
&gt; I don't think you thought through the case as long as you spent yelling because I said, "You can do this, but it's a bad idea." &amp;#x200B; Sorry, it's not my intention to appear to be yelling. But I am kind of frustrated with the .NET ecosystem in this regard, \`ToString\` being broken is frustrating. &amp;#x200B; &gt; How do you trim the return value of ToString() before you call it? You have to call it, wait for it to finish, then call Substring() , which takes longer than just displaying the whole thing. &amp;#x200B; You are right actually, the debugger wouldn't know, unless it overrides the \`System.Collections.Generic.List\` implementation of \`ToString\` itself. So, why can't \`System.Collections.Generic.List\` do the truncating/trimming? For instance, set a maximum value of N characters and have \`List.ToString\` only print that amount, like \`"\[1, 2, 3, 99.999, 100.000, ...\]"\`. Build it iteratively using StringBuilder, checking this maximum at every step of the way. &amp;#x200B; This doesn't seem like that much of a breaking change, and would fix most of the issues that you guys are mentioning: * For us who only want to display 10 or 100 list items, everything works fine * For people who have 1.000.000 items in a list and are debugging, there are no performance issues (it's not like they would want to read the whole result of ToString either, they just want the debugger to work correctly, ignoring the list). * For people who do not really care, there are no breaking changes. If they did have some \`List.ToString\` in some place in their codebase, it'd just change from \`"System.Collection.Generic.List 1\[System.Int32\]"\` to \`\[1, 2, 3\]\`, nothing would break. * For people who want specific formatting for the list, add an overload. This is new functionality, it never existed up to this point, so this doesn't break anything nor does bother anybody.
Definitely agree. Avoid anonymous when possible! Also, if OP is trying to access the data later, they might benefit from a TupleValue-keyed dictionary (c#7). `Dictionary&lt;(string, string), int&gt; quarterlies;` That way you could access value via `quarterlies[("Q1", "Profit")]`
This should do the trick: ^(var x = data.SelectMany(\_ =&gt; \_.Value.Select(\_\_ =&gt; new {T = \_.Key, Q = \_\_.Key, V = \_\_.Value}));)
They usually are? I guess you could deploy an 18 gb container with a dozen services, but it's not normal
Wat Code first doesn't seem likely to have you learning much good about databases
I think you are at a point where you need to stop focusing on "study" and focus on "do". At first, you do need to "learn". You need to know the basics of the language so you can assemble those basic parts into programs. When you pick a framework like ASP .NET and EF, you need to know the basics of how they expect you to accomplish tasks. But I don't think a person who has read 5 books about ASP .NET is any better at writing applications than a person who has read 1 book. All reading more or looking at more blogs or spending 10x the time watching videos will do is give you more little bullet points of "I need to try that one day." The thing is courses and such can only prepare you for abstract things like, "One day you'll have to write a data contract". They pick the simplest possible case and walk you through it, so you pick up the concepts. They might show some ways it can get more complicated, but they rarely walk through those cases. In the real world, the "here's how it gets more complicated" is usually every application. So what kind of applications will you be writing at your internship? Think about what the company does. Now think about a *simple* version of that for yourself. Write it. Don't make it fancy, don't try to use every bullet point in your ASP .NET courses. Figure out what it does and write exactly that. If you get stuck, good! Ask questions. Review your coursework. When it works, congratulations! Now start over and do it again. Your first time, you knew nothing. You probably did some things that made it harder to keep going later. This time, you're smarter. Remember what didn't work last time? Try something different this time. I bet you'll finish faster this time. Don't add features. Just try to make this version "better" in the sense that you didn't spend so much time asking "Wait, how do I do this again?" Cool! Now,try to make it fancy. Add one of those features I told you to avoid earlier. You'll probably have an epiphany here: "Wow, it's hard to add features to code that wasn't expecting the feature." When you feel that, great! You learned a lesson. Now start over again and write the app with that feature in mind. *This is how software developers learn*. Every project is different. You hit all the bullet points in the coursework, but it's never as easy as the course made it because instead of small, focused lessons about one facet of your framework, you need to coordinate many different facets at the same time and understand how best to manage the different parts of your code. Eventually, the basic parts become muscle memory, and you can focus on getting the more complex parts right. Eventually, some of the more complex parts become muscle memory, then you can focus on even more complex things. The goal is to, as often as possible, figure out what you did wrong on this attempt so on a future attempt you can try something different. You also want to note what worked well on this attempt, so future attempts can attempt to pursue that approach. So, stop studying and start doing. It's hard to tell when you've absorbed everything courses can teach you. It's harder to realize you could spend ten years studying and be no closer to mastery.
Trick question, like "What do you see if you look back at a flashlight you are traveling away from at the speed of light." In general, structs should only reference other structs. That's the point: "I can logically think of this as a block of memory". Reference variables are pointers, which means part of your struct is now somewhere else. You can't enforce value semantics anymore, even if the reference type is immutable, because a copy of your struct *shares* references to some other type. But that's the dogmatically pure answer. Can you write code that works and breaks this rule? Sure. It just means an assumption structs support like "this copy of that struct have no reference-equal values between them" won't hold in your codebase, and you have to behave accordingly.

&gt; The one part I lack on right know (which I'm studying here an there) is javascript, not being a web developer I neglected to learn something I wouldn't have used till that point. There's a lot of "full stack" jobs out there that realistically end up being 99.9% back end work. It's nice to be able to say you can make your way around JS, but honestly it's pretty easy to get away with not touching it.

Someone else already commented, but my hunch was not taking negative numbers into account with the 10-hour freebie (which you said you've already fixed). However I'm seeing the same thing that everyone else is, the answer just looks wrong. I'd bring it up with the instructor to be honest. Maybe there's a weird gotcha somewhere, somehow, but so far nobody here has seen one.

MS SQL server is though. I'm sure Oracle hates Microsoft.
Understandably so, but the best way to steal MS customers is to give them a migration path away from SQL Server.
So in this situation the entire API is essentially a wrapper around a C DLL. I guess the motivation behind my question is sanity testing. I expect the C API to work a particular way, so I moq it that way, but if I rip out the mocking when running on a deployed machine then I can actually validate that the C API works as expected. But I don't maintain the C API, and so maybe I shouldn't worry as much. If I have good separation of unit tests and integration tests, then maybe it won't matter as much. I have never used mocking before, so I am pretty new to this concept. I think I am agreeing that some duplication is acceptable. I am just concerned about have two *nearly* identical tests for everything. Seems like it would increase testing maintenance.
Are you really asking if it does something ridiculous?
That's much i've not expected. Thank you.
yeah, but unless I missed it, he doesn't give any benchmarks. He also writes things like "These comparisons are still very fast." -- which I intuit is totally correct- you're going to shave a few clock ticks on 3 BILLION (* multi core * HT) clock ticks a second...

I've been in that situation before. My very first library was a wrapper around a C library. I was their best QA tester because I had to write my stuff assuming their stuff did what documentation said, so I found every corner where they didn't behave as described (or didn't describe thier behavior.) What I wanted to do was create a small, quick set of automated tests that used a *mocked* set of types representing their API. If the documentation said "returns null in this case" the mocked types would do so. So this layer of tests proves, "If their library behaves like the documentation says, I do what I say I will." I wanted to *keep* the layer of tests we already had that used their actual library. The function here is if the *integration* layer tests failed, I could definitively say, "Your library isn't doing what it says it does." The end result is I wasted a lot of time and ended up writing as much code as I would have if he let me write the mocked layer. Every time my tests broke, I had to go debug. Then I'd find it wasn't behaving like I thought, and I'd have to go write a small C program to prove they had a bug. It was a pain in the butt that would've been instantaneous if I had both layers. I think, in hindsight, the "mocked" and "not mocked" tests would be pretty similar. So making them take parameters that could be *either* the mocked thing or the not-mocked thing seems a good way to get both. I'd rather accomplish it via function parameters than conditional compilation.
What additional data do you need? There's insufficient data in your answer for a meaningful response.

Mmmmm... That's really not the right answer... Sadly, to explain when one or the other makes more sense really is a technical distinction. The following is not a complete guide, but it's a good start. Generally you should default to classes. Structs should be kept small. How small is not really critical, but generally speaking you should try to stay under 64 bytes, and preferably under 32 bytes. These numbers can vary depending on how you use the struct. But try to stay under 32 bytes. Struct are (almost) always copied. So the example given here may be a bad one. If you change the name John on one struct. It will not change on others. This is even more confusing when you consider that List&lt;struct&gt; has very different usage semantics than List&lt;class&gt; whereas array of struct has almost identical semantics. Because of the previous point, structs work best when they are immutable. Though there are definetly good usages for mutable structs.

My recommendations are with these idea that you are new to .net application development, and ask assuming that you would want good exposure tho aso.net and c#.

Yes, but you have to be a bit more careful than just slapping `readonly` on your struct definition. This is one of the better sources of information on avoiding defensive copies: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/seteplia/2018/05/03/avoiding-struct-and-readonly-reference-performance-pitfalls-with-errorprone-net/
Your Linq-to-XML query is asking for "The value of the attribute named 'Type' on each child element of the elements named 'Account'". Now ask yourself: do you see an attribute named "Type" on any of those elements? I don't. So that's why your query doesn't find it. Part of what the code you didn't like says is, "Find the property named 'NetAmount' on the type 'Order'." Note that this works with the C# type. There's no way to use Linq-to-XML to ask for information about C# types. They aren't XML. The way you ask for information about C# types is to use Reflection, which is the suggestion you rejected.
I personally learnt a lot from fiddler and I do agree with your suggestion. But I believe fiddler can be useful once an individual has an understanding of http.
ASP.NET Core in Action. The answer is always ASP.NET Core in Action.
Yeah. I've run into that a lot and feel like these teams best QA tester in many cases as well. 😂 I don't want my code to break because of a bug in the underlying layer I don't control, but I also want to be able to run my tests easier. Without mocking, I need to install the underlying drivers because they are quite involved. One thing I've been mulling over is whether I can extend xUnit to solve this problem. Maybe its overkill, but we've created some xUnit attributes in the past to help keep our test code clean.

Ah, I didn't clarify, the Person is a class in this example. Hence the "not the case for structs." My description is just my own conceptual reasoning behind why using a struct anywhere. It's for when I want to clarify to myself that this object in front of me represents the *sum of its parts*, the entire thing is *one* value. "Changing any tiny thing, creates a new value, it doesn't affect the value initially passed to my function."
I actually found the answer with some help from an [identical post I made on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56381892/appdomains-and-debug-symbols/56383101#56383101). For anyone else who comes across this - you need to add FileIOPermission(PathDiscovery).
Think of it like being a chef. To be a chef, you have to graduate from a culinary school. There, they teach you many fundamentals such as knife skills and how to prepare several dozen basic dishes. Fried eggs are shockingly hard to make consistently well! Lots of other "easy" things require a lot of training to get right. Chefs learn a lot about flavor profiles as well. No one hires a chef to cook fried eggs or meatloaf consistently. You can teach a line worker to do that and save a lot of money. A chef is hired to create *new* dishes. They might consult other recipes and decide to add twists, but they're expected to bring something unique to the table. Software development is far more *Chopped* than *Alton Brown*. Nobody hires a developer to write the sites that are featured in tutorials. Instead the things people hire devs for look like what you'd get if you collected a few hundred tutorials and said, "I want a site that does all of this together." Nobody writes courses and tutorials about applications with more than a dozen features, because that's complex and hard to teach. The *good* courses and tutorials are about generalized ways to make different features work together. That's the software engineering side, things like SOLID principles and design patterns cover those topics. So a right way to approach your internship is to expect you'll probably get handed a project that asks you to do a lot of things you've never seen. Your first move should be to write a list of all the features you think it has. There are probably tutorials/courses for each of those features. Make sure you watch them if you need to. When you can do each of those things, the challenge becomes making them work *together*, which is less likely to have a tutorial! That's how I remember being frustrated in my early years. I could read a book chapter that taught me how to use a login provider in ASP .NET. I could read a book chapter that taught me to interact with a database. I could read a book chapter that taught me how to design a schema. But my problem was, "Design a site that keeps track of our IT closet inventory." To accomplish it, I had to do ALL of the things I read about at the same time. But the book was never designing *a site*, it was always demonstrating just one concept!

Right, dwarf fortress already does generate songs and poems. But the creators have often said that they have trouble with things like syntax, and context, grammar etc. A lot of the songs don't really make sense as a result. This could perfect that system imo.

The garbage is collected, the already allocated memory is just not returned to the system. It stays reserved for your application to improve speed of later allocations.
Ahh, this is what I was looking for. That makes sense. So essentially, there's some non-hardcoded "max" that it's going to allow the system, and when "releasing" the memory, it's not a legit "release" but more of a "setting aside?"
Sure. Unused memory is wasted memory, simple as that.
Sure. Unused memory is wasted memory, simple as that.
No. You were actually clear. I wrote the answer while waiting for my kids to be done with various activities so lost track during. Ended up confusing myself. That said.. I don't think I agree with that definition either. The technical details about structs means their size is also an important factor (except for edge cases). Also, nothing prevents you from changing a property on a struct without changing the intrinsic meaning of it. For example, I use nested structs fairly often (well... Often compared to usual struct usage) which may contain a state property. That property changes and does not change the meaning of the struct in the way you defined it (I think).
Well, it's not that I didn't "like" it or rejected it, I just preferred Linq, as I said. Anyway...you're saying that I can't get the value of &lt;type&gt; from &lt;account&gt;? Once I have the name, I can look up the type in the model using reflection, but I haven't got that far due to it not listing any of the attributes under &lt;account&gt;.
You're a hero for posting a solution :)
Let's make sure we're on the same page. I think you are using a word in a way that doesn't mean what you think. "Attribute" has a special meaning in XML. Here's an example: &lt;Outer&gt; &lt;Inner kind="example"&gt;something&lt;/Inner&gt; &lt;/Outer&gt; In this structure, `Outer` is an element. It has no attributes. It has children. Its only child is `Inner`, another element. The `Inner` element has an attribute named "kind" with the value "example". The `Inner` element also has the value "something". Now let's look at some of your example XML again: &lt;Account&gt; &lt;Type&gt;Cash&lt;/Type&gt; &lt;CreditLimit&gt;0.00&lt;/CreditLimit&gt; ... The `Account` element has no attributes, it has children. The first child is an element named `Type`. That element has no attributes and has the value "Cash". See what's happening? I *think* you're using the word "attribute" to describe child elements. That won't work. And none of these elements have any type information associated as far as XML is concerned. In XML, the only type is "string". (Nitpickers could point out schemas sort of add it, but we're not talking about schemas.) Until you parse that XML and put the values into a .NET object, it's just a bunch of strings. There's nothing in this XML that lets you inspect it and determine `CreditLimit` should always be a floating-point type. So you can't ask the XML that question. On the other hand, your .NET objects have types for each property. You *can* ask the .NET objects to describe their property types. If you're trying to get the names of the elements under `Account`, you need to be asking for *elements*, not *attributes*.
To be completely honest, I've never studied .net, never read a book about it, never went to tutorials, but I have a job. All I did was type code e go to stackoverflow to copy paste someone else's code. Learned absolutely everything by doing it, but had c/c++ game development background.
Suppose my application is a GUI that shows data from a database datatable. In order for the user to use the application, he has to provide his database login credentials, which includes the password that I want the application to cache. An application feature I'd like to write a small demo for is a login form that authenticates user credentials and allows him to set an expiry timer for those credentials. The login form's password field is erased when that timer elapse. The process repeats. The timer can be set for a period of up to 5 years. As you can imagine, whether the password is correct depends on the user's credential on the server -- if his DB password changes, the "cached" password is out of date (and incorrect). In this case my application would prompt the user to re-enter his credentials. But let's assume the user has set the expiry timer to 5 years and the password doesn't change (and needs to be cached) over that duration.
Or you could generate all possible songs that could fit onto a CD. Seeing as a CD contains about 700MB of data, you could randomly generate all the 1's and 0's and completely fill it up, covering every single possible mutation. You'd need a lot of CD's though, and a lot of time to burn all the data. But you'd be the owner of all the future (present and past) hit songs ;). Obviously there's more to it like the length of the songs etc, but still, not impossible.
That could be a hit song, seriously.

Lets see, as with other systems, it can seem like the sky is the limit, and there are a hundred choices for any situation. As mentioned .net core is pretty self contained, meaning that it offers all the latest backend, web, and soon to be desktop experiences. If you look at the dotnet tooling (its like npm) it has templates for all the popular project types. If you want to use angular, react, vue, or plain MVC/razor pages, it has a template for that style of project. In short, if you want to do web development, pick a frontend you like, and then learn the backend processes.
Yes to answer your question. How much depends on the object. &amp;#x200B; An object with a million rows of data could use a lot; I forget if an integer is 8 bits it has been so long since I learned that, but not very much for smaller objects.
I like the 80-90 rule now since it allows you to view the full width of two files in a split view on a 1080p screen. Which is pretty handy and I happen to work on a laptop screen ~25% of the time. Idk. It’s also easier for me to read a method call with, say, six params if they’re vertically stacked in six lines rather than spread over 150 columns.
Yes, `new` allocates memory. But the object may be garbage collected later if you don't use it.
Short answer, yes. Every time you use the keyword 'new', it's going to allocate memory for the new object. This is regardless of what you do with that object (be it assigning it to X or to nothing).
`Expression&lt;T&gt;` itself is an AST feature built in in C# which makes type-safe metadata programming extensions possible (LinqToAnything basically, or ValidationFrameworks like FluentValidation) or type-safe reflection, heck you could even compile it into a delegate at runtime (e.g. a more performant `Activator.CreateInstance` if you cache the delegate on subsequent uses). That C# feature alone is something that isn't possible on most languages or having to build an AST in a weird way (basically creating factory methods like on `Expression.*` and isn't pretty to read compared to `Expression&lt;Func&lt;T&gt;&gt;` expressions). Having the ability to compile code into AST that can be parsed at runtime is very powerful.
Yes. If it's just new Object() then I think it would add 8 bytes on the heap, 4 for a lock pointer and 4 to hold the objects runtime type id. Object doest have any internal variables to take up more space. It would also cause the 4 bytes of stack space to be allocated to hold the memory location of the new object.
I will explain the scenario briefly here. There is an 'Enemy' Object with a variable known as 'currentState' of type 'EnemyState' There are several other states objects inherited from EnemyState. i.e: 'IdleState', 'FollowState' etc. &amp;#x200B; Based on different occasions, the Enemy changes its state. I choose the following to change it currentState = new IdleState() etc. &amp;#x200B; However, the change of states is seldom.
You're doing this all wrong. You need to post: nevermind, I figured it out 😄
My favorite is when you google the problem and the first result is some asshole commenting to google the answer.
On the standard CLRs, the object header consists of two word-sized values, and the object body is always padded to a multiple of the native word size with a minimum of one. So even an `object` or another class without any fields is at least 12 or 24 byte large, depending on whether it's running on 32bit or 64bit.
Boom. This is what I had in mind, but was unsure of how to write. Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot! I agree on using a ValueTuple, however unfortunately I'm constrained to C# 6 here.
When you do new it allocates a place on the heap for the object. I suggest you do some reading on the heap, stack and value Vs reference types.
Wat was Your first tasks in job as .Net Developer ? Do You remember ?
So if I'm understanding this correctly, NET is a platform that executed the C# code?
The moment that line is executed it will take up more memory. But (as long as you don't keep another reference to the previous value of \`currentState\` the old Value will be vanished from memory with the next GC-Cycle
Yes, but by repeatedly creating a new object, the old object now lives in memory without being referenced by a variable, and it will be cleaned up by the garbage collector. Assuming instantaneous garbage collection, you will mostly only have one A object in memory (if this is your only code) because the old ones are removed. The garbage collector isn't instantaneous, but it does its job fairly well.
Thank you. I think the confusion was what you're suggesting. I hadn't actually realised that I'd used ".Attribute....". Doh! I realise that I can't get the actual type from the xml (it's obvious now you've pointed it out), the plan is now to iterate around the elements, get the name - which should match the name in my model - and then use reflection to get the type. Reading back, I haven't done a very good job of explaining that. Probably due to frustration at the time I posted after about 2 hours of struggling! Thank you for explaining, truly appreciated.
I used [https://recaffeinate.co/book/](https://recaffeinate.co/book/) to learn ASP.NET Core when I first started. Once I had a grasp for how things were done, it was all Microsoft documentations from there.
Still struggling to be honest. I think I'm going to revert to something really quite bad and just strip the xml out with regex and pull each line in to get the element name. I just can't seem to get it with linq.
It's completely unnecessary, overly long, and implies you don't take criticism. If I found this at the start of a tutorial video I'd go find another one.
I want my 45 seconds lifetime back.
What u/MeAmAtWork says basically. You are quite correct to identify this as a potential problem - if you were programming in C++ or another language without automatic garbage collection, your code would create a memory leak. You would need to manually free the memory used by the old object to get it back. A garbage collected language like C# handles this for you - once all references to an object are gone, the memory will be cleaned up by a background process.
I don't understand what input and output you're looking for. What would be the "native type" of the `Account` or `Marketing` properties? What's an example `varName` that you would pass into the `GetTypeAsString` method to "drill down"?
Serialize to json and using linq query for the descendants that don't have any children
A good explanation and sample code can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14683581/c-sharp-reflection-with-recursion
Hi, yep, that's what I've done: var type = ret2.GetType(); PropertyInfo[] properties = type.GetProperties(); foreach (PropertyInfo property in properties) { var p = property.Name; } ret2 is the object that has been serialised to an object.
either I didn't understand your question or you didn't understand my answer... But if it works for you go for it! :)
That's why I need it to be recursive. In Marketing and Account, there will be other members: Boolean OptIn {get;set;} for example. I want to be able to iterate through each member recursively and pass through to the GetTypeAsString Method, the name as a string "OptIn" and have it return "Boolean" as a string. foreach(string variableInClass in className) { var MyType = GetTypeAsString(variableInClass); }
Oh...The ret2 object is the serialised XML that I have, I've tried to use Linq to iterate through the decendants, but I only ever get the top level.
Also, if the class **A** implements **IDisposable**, then you should use your class like this: using ( var x = new A() ) { //do what you need to do with x here } //After this using statement, //the memory allocated from your new is released //and automatically marked for garbage collection.
I really question this entire design... seems smelly.
`PropertyInfo` has a `PropertyType` property of type `Type`. From there you can continue the recursion.
I can't see how else to do it. I need to return the type of any given member name. I don't know that that's going to be until the user asks for it, so I need to convert their string, then find the type and return it to them as a string.
Wow! That's the bugger! Thank you!

I think what I'm trying to do must be impossible. Just a note in case someone stumbles across this trying to do a similar thing. The recursive reflection returns a type of "System.String", for EVERY object, because it's being passed to it as a string. There appears to be no way to find the type of the value contained in the string as a name of a variable.
Yeah. Where I say 4 bytes I mean a word. Wasn't thinking about 64bit CLR

You misunderstood the quote completely if you think that means don't take criticism. &amp;#x200B; And if 45 seconds is overly long, you are in way too much of a hurry.
Great to have a good free course. I would like why you choose to make it free instead of cheap?
The first task was cover everything in the system that didn't have proper unit tests with unit tests... I have never heard of unit testing before that, or even about design patterns. Got it all from google.
Can’t you just edit the post and add the link or whatever’s else you want to add on?
Done
Good question \^\^ I'm planning other courses which will probably cost something, but for now my focus is on creating a small base and trying to reach as many people as I can
Can you write the up the lessons in C#??
Without knowing anything about the library you're using, there are two possible reason for this: - There is a bug in the library, or - You are using the library incorrectly, and the library has very poor error handling Basically, C# is a .NET language - it runs inside the .NET framework. COM is a technology which predates .NET, and was used by Visual Basic 6 for example. The error message is coming from a COM component. In other words, the C# library is calling into some older, COM code, and an error is happening inside that COM component. Error handling in COM was inferior to error handling in .NET, and any C# code that receives an error from a COM component should, ideally, create a .NET exception with a sensible message - but the library you are using does not appear to have done this, so all you're seeing is that there is an error in the COM component. Either way, I think you need to find a support group for that library (unless you're lucky enough that someone who comes along and sees this happens to know the library).
Do you mean if i could create a transcript?
You can use an interface, e.g. list&lt;IMyListItem&gt;, which will allow you to store different concrete types (implementations) of IMyListItem. But it won't help when trying to store different primitive types.
Oh don't mind me, I was just making a joke haha. I was saying you should make German lessons written in C#
Oh \^\^ I think that would be a slight overkill :)
Comes to mind: a programmer has a problem and thinks "oh ill use a regular expression" - now he has two problems
It's also worth checking the event log as sometimes it provides more information.
this is you... not taking criticism\^\^ &amp;#x200B; don't ask for peoples opinion if your not going absorb it :)
Thanks for the detailed response! I will ask in the RSA forum.
&gt; (Can someone explain to me how to insert code properly on Reddit please?) For a multiline code block, prefix every line with 4 spaces. For an inline `code expression styled like this` wrap the text with the \` tick mark character (on the tilde ~ key).
I think this answer is different for everybody. I'm going to tell you what works for me and how I feel. This part of your post is what concerned me the most: &gt; Before I start to make my ideas into real applications, I would like to masterize .NET to some point when I am so fluent that I can implement new ideas very smoothly and fast. The certification *might* do you some good. It will expose you to some things you haven't done. But the certification *by itself* isn't going to make you an app developer. Here's how to be an app developer: 1. Choose an app you can finish. 2. Finish it. 3. Congratulations! You're an app developer. 4. Do it again. What I cannot stress enough is when you are doing (1) *for learning*, make sure to choose an app you KNOW you can complete. Since you don't think you are very skilled right now, don't pick something huge like, "the POS system for a supermarket" yet. Pick something small that can get bigger. Heres' an example. Maybe start with, "An application that lets me maintain an inventory of my books." That'll need a database, and you'll have to implement CRUD pages. Pick a framework (ASP .NET MVC, WPF, WinForms, whatever) and hack at it. When you finish, great! Try it again with a different database. You'll be surprised that it goes smoother this time, because you know what mistakes you made last time. When it's finished again, pick another database and do it again. This time it should be *really* easy. Good! When you think it's easy to do it with any kind of database, add a feature. What if there are multiple users? Add login! This requires storing usernames/passwords, but also your application needs a concept of "Who is logged in?" and should change how it displays data and what it lets a user do based on that. When you finish, do it again. Implement it over and over from scratch until you feel like you aren't making big mistakes anymore. There are always new things to add to it. Unit tests. Dependency Injection. "What is Autofac and can it help me?" The list goes ever on, you'll never run out of, "How would I write this app if I used {this technology} instead?" If you feel like you run out of things: pick a new app. My examples above were "a book inventory". How might the system to manage "a video rental store" be different? What about a payroll system? Maybe a blog engine. Any app you use every day is an opportunity for you to learn something by implementing it! At some point, you have to stop studying and start *doing*. You are "an app developer" the moment you finish your first app. It never goes away!
I wouldn't be surprised if it was a 32-bit vs. 64-bit issue. I'm guessing your program is built for the `Any CPU` platform. Maybe try building it for `x86`, instead?
Is it possible to share a pre-built .vstheme?
Couple of things to note. Never ever ever ever ever ever hard code your encryption key. I recently [was assigned a CVE ](https://www.gnzlabs.io/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-hard-coded-encryption-key/) for finding this in a bit of software. Super easy to break, especially in .NET. Second thing, your implementation may be vulnerable to a padding oracle attack because you're using CBC mode. The attack itself is pretty neat, but if you don't want to dig into it, the mitigating control is: MAC and sign your ciphertext, then verify these before decrypting. When using cryptography in .NET, best policy is to pair AES with RSA. Then you can generate random symmetric keys, encrypt those random keys with RSA, encrypt your plaintext with AES, then hash and sign the whole thing.
Why advertise a German course in English?
Spamming your German course in a German forum would be better?
This is an excellent response. Can’t recommend it enough!
so, for the key storage, i was actually gonna store it in a registry entry, and then distribute the registry entry to servers. Im in a spot where i have my dev box, a qa box, and a production box. the production setup has its own dedicated webserver and db, but QA and Dev share the same DB, while being different webservers. Therefore I thought with a external reg key, all 3 could share the same key, completely outside the website code/folder/etc
Google works in mysterious ways
That would be very interesting to see two people with different native languages try to communicate via a programming language.
People use the languages they know to learn the languages they do not know. If C# is known language and German is unknown then it is seems possible to use C# to learn German.
Oof. Please don't do that. To be fair, key storage is a bitch. Many great cryptosystems are broken because of it. Microsoft does some stuff to make it easier for us, though. You know the RSA thing I mentioned earlier? There's a keystore in Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccng/key-storage-and-retrieval) you can access with RSACryptoServiceProvider that makes it a lot easier. If you'd like to see a working, fully audited .NET cryptosystem, PM me your GitHub username. I have a private repo with some crypto code I did recently for work. Leverages RSA, AES, the Windows keystore, and the TPM. You can feel free to use it as a template or steal it wholesale.
That's true^^ i hope someone will succeed in learning german by watching a c# course!
Cause I'm silly ^^ and I thought perhaps there are some coders who can speak german and have subscribed this subreddit who can profit from the course, or some english speakers have german friends...
Recommend reading this anecdotal story: https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2009/july/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing-it-wrong/
Sry if you see this course as spam, i will remember it the next time... and I will translate the course into english, it's unfair that only german speakers get a free course... I beg your pardon
&gt; Love that expression. I wonder if it could be extracted into an extension method. 🤔 Yes, always. LinQ expression syntax is just syntactic sugar over the LinQ methods (Select, SelectMany, etc.) ``` var flat = from kvp1 in data from kvp2 in kvp1.Value select new { k1 = kvp1.Key, k2 = kvp2.Key, v = kvp2.Value }; ``` converts to ``` var flat = data.SelectMany( kvp1 =&gt; kvp1.Value, (kvp1, kvp2) =&gt; new { k1 = kvp1.Key, k2 = kvp2.Key, v = kvp2.Value }); ``` SelectMany is one of the few times I find the Linq expression syntax to be much more readable.
Check out the Windows API CodePack. It has a WFP control that does exactly what you need. It wraps the aforementioned Windows APIs so you don’t have to. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usisvde/2009/05/27/get-the-windows-api-code-pack-for-the-microsoft-net-framework/
I was more thinking about building something reusable with generic so that people can just drop that in their project as a reusable component.
It is called a joke, and if 45 seconds gets rid of the people with no sense of humor, than mission accomplished. &amp;#x200B; Thank you for your feedback.
Thanks. I tried it but doesn't worked.
Where can I find it?
&gt; I have finished master degree in Computer Science too And you can't write an app.. Yeah, a certification course isn't going to change that. Learn by doing. This idea you seem to have that you can become fluent with some book study is not reality. Do you think you could read some books about framing and roofing and then go smoothly build an entire house without difficulty?
When using structs, make sure ALL of the following is true: * The data it is initialized with cannot be changed for that instance (i.e immutable) * The struct must always be logically valid in its default state. * The instance size of the struct is small (64 bytes max, 16 bytes max preferably). Remember, its value gets copied everywhere so it takes up more memory than passing around a pointer. * The thing you are trying to model logically represents a single value like an integer, double, etc. Structs can be more performant than classes but you should only use them (for the most part) if ALL of the above can be true for what you are trying to model. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/521298/when-to-use-struct) is a StackOverflow post describing it better.
Wouldn't anyone who want to pick up C# or any other common language would eventually still have to learn all of the concepts and terms in English? Just curious. I myself, couldn't imagine learning programming in my language.
You will definitely accumulate some knowledge preparing for the exams, but at the end of the day I feel the certs themselves are a waste of money. I'll echo the commenter above me and suggest you start building something. "Mastering" any tech stack isn't really a static task as best practices and the tech itself is constantly evolving. Imo "mastery" comes from working through challenges while building applications, acknowledging your weaknesses and finding appropriate resources to help in those situations. Basically it comes down to practice, you could get every cert Microsoft offers but never put it into practice and end up a garbage engineer. TLDR; pick a project, get to coding. Good luck!
tldw
I mean, it is still a C# course...
.Net is good but praising it for flexibility is wrong. For example there is only one web framework and you have to do everything by the book.
Most .NET developers really like to do everything by the book and only use the designated tech that they've heard that everyone seems to be using. But in reality there much more things out there, just web frameworks I can remember six of them. I always felt that the web stack offered by Microsoft was clunky and verbose, so I've never used it for anything serious, always used other stuff and I've deployed more than 20 websites to production in the last years. Same deal with databases for example, many people that use .NET don't have a clue that they can literally use anything from Redis to Mongo to MariaDB and are stuck doing everything with what comes pre-bundled with Visual Studio.
Yes of course you have to learn all the concepts and terms in english... but especially for beginner it's easier to understand and learn based on their primary language...that's at least my opinion \^^/
For example very young coders (~12 years eg) always tend to use german variable names (based on my experience as a tutor)
Yes that is the stigma around net developers but its also Microsoft fault. I tried to write web framework to replace ASP net mvc core. Its borderline hostile, for example even if I dont use any ASP net dlls msbuild tries to compile cshtmls and you have to explicitly disable it. There are tons of nuances like that, things at every level is wired for Microsoft templates and tools. That's why I prefer Node, that is flexibility. A canvas.
I've been writing a functional library for C# for the past couple of months, mostly implementing what I need for work, plus things I liked in Haskell. &amp;#x200B; It's on nuget [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nordril.Functional/) and [github](https://github.com/nordril/functional/) if anyone wants to check it out and maybe give feedback. :)
I've coded since I was 11. I've always used English terms and this benefited me a lot, especially with stackoverflow questions. Edit: Very nice guide though
&gt; at some point you have to stop studying and start doing And most of the time, that point is waaaay earlier than people think it is.
True!
There’s nothing “wrong” with hardcoded key storage on a server. It’s not great, but it’s not broken
Have you considered SQL transparent encryption? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-2017
It's not inherently broken, but it is a weakness by definition. See: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html Combined with other seemingly minor issues, it can invalidate your entire security model.
Being the author of this library, I thanked this group for the comments, reactions and contributions. Because of you, I have made a lot of changes and improvements on this library, especially to a guy named @AngularBeginner. He gives me realization on the bugs I introduced on this library in the early stage (Sync vs Async) topics. And for those who get annoyed at me for reposting RepoDb (every month), apology for that. This is my first public group and community exposure, and I am only interested on RepoDb for now. I never have thought, r/csharp is really a one of the biggest community of C#, I should have aware on that on the first place and be vigilant on my postings. Lastly, I thanked Frans for his big contribution on this library, his RDAB help me improve this library as (it helps me profile every line of codes I am doing, during my development). Thanks for the 'IsDbNull' technique, surely I will share what else RepoDb is doing on top of that. This could be my last post on r/csharp about RepoDb. I am looking forward to discuss other topics in the future.
unfortunately the database is .... sql 2000, so i dont think that feature is available.... (we is ~~poor~~ cheap)
Oh, honey....
Not that I'd ever do this.... *wink nod nod smile looks away*... But I'd consider running an updated dev version for just this store.
Your encryption is very weak for a number of points. Some have been listed here already, but something not mentioned yet is a lack of salting. With your current method, two identical strings that are encrypted will have the same result - this is bad, this makes it much easier to reverse engineer your key from the encrypted data alone. Ideally, you want to encrypt the data with a _salt_ that's randomly generated each time and stored with the data. Then when you want to decrypt the data, you read the salt for that data and use it to derive the encryption key before doing the decryption. In other words, instead of generating a single, static encryption key you have a static "password" that you combine with a salt to _derive_ a unique encryption key for each encryption operation. You'll want to use `Rfc2898DeriveBytes` to derive your encryption key from a "static" passphrase (Which can be just a string as well) and a salt that you generate each time. The value (which can be generated just using `RNGCryptoServiceProvider` like in your example) of the salt is not a secret, so you can just prepend it to the encrypted data to read back later. This Stackoverflow link has a good example of this in practice: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168240/encrypting-decrypting-a-string-in-c-sharp As others have mentioned, the most important thing is how and where you store that static password (What you're calling a key at the moment) - storing it in the registry isn't exactly secure and means if that machine is compromised, you can assume all your data is no longer encrypted. However, if this only has to be fairly weak encryption then it's probably enough. As others have mentioned, there are other easier ways of encrypting your data - SQL server has Dynamic Data Encryption that means your data is encrypted and only specific users can access it.
&gt; Your encryption is very weak for a number of points. Some have been listed here already, but something not mentioned yet is a lack of salting. With your current method, two identical strings that are encrypted will have the same result - this is bad, this makes it much easier to reverse engineer your key from the encrypted data. So looking at what's actually getting saved in the db, though certain values, in plaintext, are identical, in their encrypted form, they're different.
That's because you're writing the IV first, which _is_ randomly generated within your code. Those first IV bytes will always be different with how you've written it and as a result, the encrypted bytes will _look_ different but cryptographically speaking they are not.
&gt;Two birds with one **Rosetta** stone
Make an LLC its easy. Make an app its easy. You just have to do it. If you have the time and an idea, just do it. There really isn't any more to it. You just start and keep going. Will what you do be perfect and successful everytime? No but you learn and keep going.
You're using Microsoft tooling, and complaining it's geared to work with the Microsoft stack?
I wonder if my pre-existing knowledge of c# will help me learn some german
It's worth a try :D
I've never use Sqlite, but there should have a Sqlite.ExecuteNonQuery() method that doesn't return a DataReader but directly execute the query.
Masterize? What's this? New tech?
no its 45 seconds long lmao
What does tidw mean? (I am afraid to ask, but I asked for all this abuse).
Thank you! I clicked on the inline code button, but could never figure out what I was supposed to do after that. Some sites have a popup where you can insert code and selected the language, but I guess Reddit is only a very small percentage of programmers.
are you a native english speaker?
Are you talking about Enable-Migrations command? That's a Visual Studio specific thing. Look into dotnet ef.
Too Long, Didn't Watch
Make QA identical to production... Do not share it with dev.
If you are on a Windows computer, download SqliteExpert (free) and use it to run and test your SQL in it. Your update Sql needs where if you want to update only specific record e.g. "UPDATE mytable SET name=@name WHERE id=@id" Then add your @name and @id parameters. -------- Your delete command is wrong - it will work only if you have 1 item in the listview. The number of parameters need to match. If you have say 2 items the delete will become for example: "DELETE FROM mytable WHERE name=@name1 OR name=@name2" And then you add 2 parameters @name1 and @name2.
A stabilized resumé of masterized skills will synergize with the nearest recycle bin.
Will it let you rename a file to match it's class type? Will it allow you to move a class into a separate file? I use that alot with R#
Protip: technical term for this is "inertia"
That made it work, thank you :)
And what happens when your Android code doesn't compile when the build target is iOS?
Every time I've had this happen, it turned out my preprocessor directives were not what I thought they were. This was especially true when I was sharing a file between different projects via file links. When you do that, VS has an opinion about what project has that file open, and doesn't give a flip about your selected build configuration. (Major PITA back in the days of sharing code between WPF and Silverlight.) So, is it a linked file? If so, check the properties of *each* process that has it within. One or more doesn't have UNITY_ANDROID defined. If it's not a linked file, do the same thing anyway. Check every build configuration.
I'll have to check that out! Looks pretty dope. Also, per the update function, so this is currently my string from the MS example on creating the table: String tableCommand = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT " + "EXISTS MyTable (Primary_Key INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, " + "Text_Entry NVARCHAR(2048) NULL)"; How would I create it so that I have a specific id for each? As for my delete command, I got it working doing the below statement but it just deletes items in the listview with the same name only if you select one (only because I haven't done it to match by id per deletion I'm assuming): // Db connection and all is above, copyOfSelectedItems is param to Delete function db.Open(); foreach (var item in copyOfSelectedItems) { SqliteCommand deleteCommand = new SqliteCommand ("DELETE FROM MyTable WHERE Text_Entry=@text", db); deleteCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@text", item.ToString()); deleteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery(); } db.Close(); but it works when I put *multiple selection* mode on the listview in XAML, I guess it's a workaround? Since we're on the subject, is there anyway to store a string\[\] array in a database value? The plan of this is for me to learn the basic CRUD ops with sqlite and put it in my other application for managing tasks, just as a local database. One of the parameters would be a string array consisting of tags for the task, i.e.,: // Tags to define the type of task string[] tags = new string[] { "UWP", "XAML", .... } TaskDetails.AddNewTask(title, id, assignee, description, colorKey, category, tags); // NOTE ^^: Where every parameter is a string besides tags, which is the string[] Whereas taken from the code at the beginning of this comment to create the table: String tableCommand = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT " + "EXISTS MyTable (Primary_Key INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, " + "Text_Entry NVARCHAR(2048) NULL)"; I've checked through the available values for database values, such as NVARCHAR(2048), but I haven't found anything there or online about being able to do something that. Just thought I'd check for an idea while it pertained to the topic. Thank you for your time and help :)
Did you check the library's required .NET version? Sometimes a lib needs a specific .net, and everything else causes it to crash (if it was poorly written). You can change the .NET version under the Properties of the project.
Can I mooch off of this, as well? I need to do some form of data encryption fo the limited data stored in an ETL software I'm writing and could use the guidance.
What do you mean? That's the point of the preprocessor, no?
Sure, shoot me a PM
Looking at your project it seems it's an ASP.Net website, if you're just starting out you should be creating an ASP.Net **Core** website as it's the newer framework and set to replace .Net framework. You're also installing EntityFramework**Core**, Rider only supports those menu options for old entity framework. Furthermore if you're using ASP.Net you should be using EntityFramework v6-something. Yes, this is confusing as hell and microsoft's naming conventions is a common criticism as these sorts of issues aren't uncommon even for experienced developers jumping into .Net/ .Net Core... What you should do: 1. create a new ASP.Net **core** project, select the MVC(Model view controller) variant. 2. Install EntityFrameworkCore packages via nuget. 3. Follow the directions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet) to use the command line tools for entity framework.
I'd like to add to what everyone else has said and say that if you plan for these strings to be dynamic and compatible across a large number of instances, you might want to mark the version of your text with a byte of text in front of it. This way, when you inevitably find out you did encryption wrong ( :( ), or the encryption you use becomes obsolete, all the instances of your application can determine which encryption mechanism is in place during a rollout. Note this would be a custom identifier like 0, 1, 2, etc, definitely not related to the type of encryption you're using. There's a good example of this in this breakdown of aspnet core identity (though it uses hashing, not encryption). Dotnet core source code also has some encryption examples for example with json web tokens, etc, if you dig through it. https://andrewlock.net/exploring-the-asp-net-core-identity-passwordhasher/
Press windows key and type eventviewer. Click Windows-logs -&gt; Programs (most likely). Check if any of the rows seems to be an error associated with your program or library.
You remind of this jerk at my work that used to send me 'Let Me Google That For You' links. It is your acronym, if you use one no one knows then what was the point of using it? Sorry I wasted a few seconds of your life.
I just put my input in the Text block and type random characters into the Expression block until I get what I want https://regexr.com/ But seriously, I've used that site a fair amount and it's been very helpful. I know the basics, but I can't remember all the rules off the top of my head since I don't use it every day.
Amazing read! I think this is awesome and I will definitely give it a try on my next project! Thanks for developing it and releasing it to the masses, congratulations man! 👏🏻👏🏻
Then use something else other than SQL server. Running on sql2000 is just dangerous.
I was trying to empower you to find them yourself in the future given the embarrassment you expressed when you asked. I recognize that there are sometimes obscure acronyms used, and occasionally I have to check them myself. This method I described works (for me) every time, even if it's so obtuse that it's Urban Dictionary that defines it. And I agree that the "lmgtfy.com" links are basically rude in their own, often passive aggressive. Beyond that, sometimes googling is the answer.
.node is fucking dogshit
can you share some working ironPython code that does the same thing? I had a look around the easily accessible parts or the RSA website, and I must say the API documentation is some of the shittiest and hard to find library documentation. for example, the "learn more" link on the main product page for the topic of the API (in the section telling you about all the great features) links to [this](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/robot-structural-analysis-products/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/ROBOT-API-how-to-get-list-of-available-materials-in-model.html). WTF? I eventually found and downloaded the offline help for the whole program, and i finally found that the Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis SDK itself comes with some documentation, but that's not installable on it's own. if you step through the code, which line breaks it?
Holy shit
it’s not really a matter of whether it’s a joke or not. viewers don’t enjoy long intros. This is a fairly long one
[The Wadsworth Constant](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-wadsworth-constant) &gt; The Wadsworth Constant is an axiom which states that the first 30% of any video can be skipped because it contains no worthwhile or interesting information. &gt; &gt;&gt; _For EVERY youtube video, I always open the video and then immediately punch the slider bar to about 30 percent. For example, in this video, it should have just started at :40. Everything before :40 was a waste. This holds true for nearly every video in the universe._
I’m going to say no. It’s been found in neuroscience, that the more pathways you create to a subject matter, the more it deepens your understanding, and allows you to retain information. So if you’re learning a subject through reading, you’re not going to retain it well or for long. As someone who got his MCSD many moons ago, I have very little knowledge of the information I “learned” - mostly because I crammed for the exams one subject at a time, and once I passed a test, I moved on to the next one. When I search, read documentation, write code with unit tests, I’m much more likely to retain that knowledge.
It is for a 4 hour video, and with my other videos with a 30 second animated introduction, I get 30 seconds of views at a time before they bail. I just increased that by 50%! You can't make everyone happy.
Let me tell you a little secret; I wasn't really coming here giving a crap of anyone's opinion. I was showing off a video I am making, and this was the coming attractions preview. If you think I come to Reddit to hear what these people think, you must have fell off a turnip truck. They kill dreams so fast here your head never has time to touch the pillow, much less enter REM sleep. And why would be embarrassed? Because a few people that don't like a video I made? How many of the people that didn't like can even do 3D animation at all would be my first question, and how many have 20+ years of SQL Experience would be my second question, and 3rd, who gives a crap what people from Reddit think? Most people here are nice and answer questions for free, but I get down voted for giving away free code just because someone here doesn't find it useful. They seem to be selfish and not understand open source is meant to help the people that might find it useful, but if it gets down voted because someone doesn't understand it then their hate prevents someone else from learning. Sorry if you think a few redditors can bring me down. I haven't had teeth in over a decade, so this is not even a speed bump: https://www.gofundme.com/teeth-a-thon
Isn't this what Pluralsight does, and even DevU? I'm all for more content on the web but not sure this has a home standalone. I could be wrong.
why are the videos 4 hours
VS is graying our code that will not be compiled based on your currently-selected build configuration.
You can even use desktop. With mechanical keyboard. Boom!
No you're right, Pluralsight would be my choice. It's on Kickstarter so there's no guarantee you'll get anything. There's no detailed curriculum or information about how long the course is, there are loads of grammatical errors, and who the fuck wants to code in Vim when you have VS Code for example.
I’m aware about enable migrations command on package manager console on VS but jetbeains has a page when it mentions that right clicking on the project brings up a menu that has tools on it and under that there are options for Ef framework which is showing up for mine. So I wS just wondering if I installed something wrong
Yeah i know, I want to know how to turn that off. It's really slowing down my development.
I was wondering why the whole article had nothing of any substance in it. Then I got to the "what we provide" bit: &gt; 1. Finishing your database Homework. &gt; 2. Completing your Database Assignments. Now it makes sense. Of course you have no interest in educating anyone, because you make money from lack of education, by helping people cheat.
I clicked it expecting a poorly written rehash of a bunch of alleged anti-patterns, so I was pleasantly surprised.
Spamity spam.
thanks.i will learn windows api.
This is almost exactly the same comment I got when I released this: https://syncretia.bandcamp.com/track/shit-hot-banger
Simplest solution (assuming you logic is already thread safe) - use Parallel.ForEach. Put the result into a thread safe collection like ConcurrentBag&lt;T&gt;. What is the processing you're doing? String manipulations on thousands of elements should be done in a few milliseconds.
There is A LOT of string processing done, but I cannot predict just how many elements will be added to this list. I can’t go into detail about the logic but it is a single method. So for example: // Let’s say this list contains 50,000 List&lt;string&gt; items = new List&lt;string&gt;(); Then I use a for loop to iterate through every single item. for (int i = 0; i &lt; items.Length; i++) { AppendData(items[i]); } AppendData pretty much looks like this: private void AppendData(string path) { string newData = string.Empty(); // About 100 lines of logic that // “just works”. builder.Append(newData) } Then after everything is done the string builder gets saved to a document. How would I go about multithreading AppendData? I know I could have used a function but function or not, it’s appending data to the string builder which makes using one over the other pure syntactic sugar, I’m the only programmer.
If you run cpu profiling on it, where's the bottleneck? Hundreds of thousands lines might take about hundreds megs of RAM, you might get better performance if you can streamline the process (ie, read the line directly from the source file, transform, immediately write to output) allowing Windows file caching to works itself.
Throwing more threads at a solution to getting more throughput sounds pretty straight-forward but can be surprisingly miss-leading. Whenever you have a performance issue you should always first understand where the time is spent and what parts of it are slow. Once this is understood, it’s then solvable. The solution will depend on the problem. Doing a few thousand string manipulations should really not be a problem. I expect your problem is elsewhere in your inner loop? Are you doing a db query for every line? Reading a text-file to find mappings? Adding threads could improve cpu usage but then you have to take into account critical sections and it’s very possible to introduce threading bugs that are very difficult to resolve. Also throwing thousands of threads at a problem will probably grind the whole machine to a halt. For future reference you should not have more CPU bound threads than there are cores in the CPU.
Don't use builder in your method. Assuming it's `StringBuilder`, it's not a thread-safe class. Every read and write access to a shared resource must be synchronized. Instead return the new data, collect it from all jobs, then just concatenate and write it out in a single swift.
&gt; especially to a guy named AngularBeginner. He saw the bugs I introduced on this library in the early stage (topics: Sync vs Async). I have no recollection of anything like this ever happening.
StringBuffer can be used in place.
Sure, if it's a thread-safe class. But it will internally do some locking, which will be a bottle neck, unless those 100 lines of logic are actually really CPU intensive.
This sounds excellent, mind if I jump on the bandwagon and see what you've done?
CREATE TABLE \[my\_table\] ( \[id\] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \[name\] VARCHAR); &amp;#x200B; This will create an id as primary key and the id will be auto-incremented as well.
`base` isn't to necessarily do do with polymorphism, neither is `this`: [base documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/base) [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/this) Polymorphism is more of a concept, here is a good description [I've found on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8005176) &gt;**Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.** &gt; &gt;The beauty of polymorphism is that the code working with the different classes does not need to know which class it is using since they’re all used the same way. A real world analogy for polymorphism is a button. Everyone knows how to use a button: you simply apply pressure to it. What a button “does,” however, depends on what it is connected to and the context in which it is used — but the result does not affect how it is used. If your boss tells you to press a button, you already have all the information needed to perform the task. I suggest you read this: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/polymorphism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/polymorphism) However I find it odd that interfaces aren't mentioned. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/index) [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6147658/are-interfaces-compatible-with-polymorphism](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6147658/are-interfaces-compatible-with-polymorphism) [https://www.interfacett.com/videos/understanding-c-interfaces-polymorphic-behavior-dan-wahlin/](https://www.interfacett.com/videos/understanding-c-interfaces-polymorphic-behavior-dan-wahlin/)
I love it. I grew up with The Orb, FSOL, A guy called Gerald, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin, etc. It reminded me a little of [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1JrnoEbQDE) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50LBw1Qj0ys). Different style, but same sort of emotional connection if that makes sense. Oo, just found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJAthNaUd8) which I haven't heard in years. The chorus is glorious.
Oh you might like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTGl4ItMxwI) one too. I'll stop now :)
Thanks! I'll look at it.
Thanks a lot for the reply. This is so good hints. But I guess this is for the amateurs and people who would like to be an app developers from but are starting. I know it well. I did it some years ago. I made several applications just for training my own. Some of them are almost complete and are nice. I have almost 3 years of commercial work with complex business program. I do not need certifications for employee, rather I was thinking to do it as the way to prepare myself to be fluent in implementing my own ideas (study Microsoft books which are preparing to the exam and then pass it for fun). I expect it would stabilize my knowledge and fill gaps.
Also, if *order* is important then multithreading may not work anyway (since there is no guarantee of output order based on input order without additional metadata or locking structure - which slows things down).
Use a BlockingCollection. It's a nice producer consumer implementation. Pop the work in at one end, configure it to process items in parallel at the other. Bung the results into a concurrent collection class.
Change your build configuration in the dropdown and it will highlight.
The gray boxes are empty for me, even disabled adblocker.
Put everything into an array instead of a list. Use parallel for each on the array. After your string operation put the new string at the index of your starting string. There will be no locking or blocking this way. After the parallel foreach use string.join on the array. I use this on csv files and events with 200k strings - works flawlessly
Why are you using if (!object.ReferenceEquals(this.PropertyChanged, null)) Instead of just checking for null equality? Also if you want it to be thread safe store the event in a local variable then check that for null and call that so another thread can’t be set to null between both lines
This null-check is now NOT necessary in today's processors :) . It was a code I written around 2007, which I written on my first project. This code is a big legacy. I am creating a small library for this to become more pluggable for use.
 if (!object.ReferenceEquals(this.PropertyChanged, null)) { this.PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } You know you can just do: PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); (And gain atomicity in the process.) You should also use `CallerMemberName` to make this simpler.
The code copied was on my old blogs, asked by somebody. :) &amp;#x200B; I introduce the same approach here recently: [https://github.com/mikependon/Tutorials/blob/master/WPF/TreeViewFileExplorer/TreeViewFileExplorer/ShellClasses/FileSystemObjectInfo.cs](https://github.com/mikependon/Tutorials/blob/master/WPF/TreeViewFileExplorer/TreeViewFileExplorer/ShellClasses/FileSystemObjectInfo.cs) &amp;#x200B; Line: 46, 51, 56, 61 &amp;#x200B; I will change then and issue a new version.
Man, **you didn't read my post at all.** For now **I have like almost 3 years of commercial experience in C#**, working everyday with quite large application for business. **I did several interesting desktop applications**, just few of them finished (some had complex logic + simple UI), but never decided that are ready for deploying and selling them. One of this app was **analyzing chess game situations**, another one was **hunting the auctions by the statistics**. So **I definitelly know how to do an app**. Even I could before I finished Computer Science. **Please read my post again before you write something again.** I do not need certifications for employee, rather I was thinking to do it as the way to prepare myself to be fluent in implementing my own ideas (study Microsoft books which are preparing to the exam and then pass it for fun). I expect it would stabilize my knowledge and fill gaps. **You are claiming that only practise can make you a developer. I think that only practise + theory can make you complete developer.** And I have enough practise so I lack in theory to get better.
For once, this might just be a job for `Parallel.ForEach`. It usually isn't, but this time it might be. Try benchmarking the before and after with [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org)
Hi I did it. It is not I want to learn how to do an app. I want to be that good that implemeting complex app doesn't takes me too long. However I agree that certifications aren't the best way. I would go through tutorials and documentations of Microsoft while programming at the same time too. Do not worry I have already a lot of coding in practise, 40 hours per week since 3 years is just recently. I did much more before by my own.
I cheked it. Was my mistake. I edited the post with the solution.
You are right, more I was meaning I would like to pick a book dedicated to the exam from Microsoft. And study this book while doing some coding about what I read. Then pass exam. And do few of them. Anyway I would go with tutorials and documentation rather than such a book. Very nice paragraph about neuroscience. Thanks a lot! I agree.
I've been working on a simple sql wrapper library. Basically all it does is build a query string and assign command parameters for the variables required.

I was answering your question and I realized what the problem was. I edited the post with the solution. Thanks for your answer.
No I am not. What is the matter? I can't write proper grammar, maybe yes, but I guess I am writing in understandable way, am I not? Regards :)
poly means "many", morph means "different types of the same thing". So we're talking about something having many different types of the same thing. A car can be a Ford or a Honda, etc, but they're all cars. In C# we can do that in two ways. Interfaces and inheritance. Interfaces are just a set of methods/properties that a class must implement. ICat might have a Meow method, so all classes that implement ICat must have a Meow method. (This is sort of changing, but let's keep it simple). Inheritance is more tricky. You have a base class, the parent, and then child classes can inherit from it. This gives the children all the methods and properties of the parent, but can also override them. If the parent has a method "Party WhoDoIVoteFor()" which for the parent returns "Conservative", the child can override it so it returns "LibDem". If they don't override it, it will continue to return "Conservative". There are loads of rules around inheritance, it's way too much to go into here. One final thing, you can only inherit from one base class, but can implement many interfaces.
I’m not sure what you mean, « processors » still work the same? And i’ve never seen anyone use referenceequal to do a null check on an event instead of just checking for null. Also not trying to be harsh but if you’re posting this for people to learn/use why not refactor it before? You just said it was one of your first projects and it is a 12 years old code base, surely it could be simplified a lot.
Sounds fair. There are lots of legacy approach on the code as well, even on the Interop class. I will simplify that using Enums (with Flags attribute) so it would be become more readable. I forgot that ultimate reason TBH for the ReferenceEquals. It has a performance benefits in the old days. Correct me if I am wrong here.
Yes. And it's why your idea is impossible.
It may be a trick that predates my own .net learning but otherwise i don’t see why checking for null (which in any case can only be done against a reference type as others were not nullable) could be any slower. You probably picked it up on an edge case were equality was overriden and == was not referenceequal or from a confusion with struct.
Arrays are one-dimensional, I would rather load items in one at a time easily instead of counting the items, setting an arrays size, then populating it. Your method requires iterating over the data 3 times. And parallel for each would be a great solution if it actually ordered the threads correctly, because 90% of the time what it spits out is now in the same order as it came in. This can be fixed by prefixing the strings with a number and reorganizing the collection, then remove the prefixes before appending, but now I’m creating additional overhead and iterating the collections 3x more than necessary. I think I’m just going to say fuck Nancy at this point.
thanks for the explanation
thanks for the links I will read or watch them
Thouthand of lines is nothing, we’re not talking billions here and it’s a task that doesn’t seem time critical, however if you insist on making it faster 1) you mentioned it runs on a popato pc, does it even have multiple cores? Else all you can expects is a slowdown 2) the time spent is certainly not spent on turning your example input into your exemple output with simple string logic, otherwise you’d be seeing millions getting done in seconds, it has to be in your business logic and we need to see it, if you can’t post it you can pseudocode it 3) is it ok if the output lines come in a different order than the input ones or is it unordered? This will matter if multithreading turns out to be the solution
Humm first question the stringbuilder is used for what ? Is the application create a file or the results are display into the application ui ? Also, can we have the code that's just work ? You have to avoid string allocation. So, is your application read the input data from a file or anything that can be a stream ?
&gt; I forgot that ultimate reason TBH for the ReferenceEquals. It has a performance benefits in the old days. The only way it would be different at all is if equality was overridden.
.NET Core is changing things; people are getting more flexible with the tooling. And doing large scale projects on Linux with it as well.
I hope it helped. It's a complex thing to get your head around.
np
You're on a wild goose chase. Keep ignoring the top poster and don't actually profile to see why your code is slow. Just throw threads at your StringBuilder, that'll work lol.
I just released [MedievaLands](https://www.medievalands.com), my recreation of The Shadow of Yserbius. Yserbius was a MMORPG dungeon crawler from 1993. I tried to recreate the old game pixel for pixel, but snuck in some modern quality of life enhancements from modern games. The game is written in C#, with the server running on .NET Core 2.0, and the client running on the FNA Framework on Windows and Mac. FNA also allows for porting to Linux but I don't have a good testing machine for that. The total server/client codebase is approximately 96,500 lines of code, and took my nine months to write. Including time spent deciphering the original game's data formats, I estimate that I spent 2,500 hours on this remake. It has truly been a labor of love, taking up every non-work hour I could spare for the past nine months. Seeing a handful of people exploring the dungeon or idling in the tavern has been a great experience. :) This has also been a huge learning experience for me - I've been coding for years but have never released anything by myself. I had to learn about setting up a website, a patching mechanism, code signing, not to mention a full network stack, packet design, text rendering, user interface controls, and so on. Everything in the game is bespoke except the FNA framework and MP3 rendering. When it works - which is most of the time - I can't help but smile.
Thanks. I read it somewhere in the articles before (before 2010), I also saw it being used by Microsoft on the InitializeComponent() method of WinForms. This is just the only thread I can see about the benefits. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9910996/legitimate-uses-of-referenceequals](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9910996/legitimate-uses-of-referenceequals) Anyway, thanks. Btw, I just updated the 'gists' and at the same time the actual Github project with the small optimization.
yep I know that is why I have to study it. I understand alreeady method overloading and the virtual and overridden. and c# people say that is only a tip of the iceberg so I try to find resources to learn more .
Hey, you soggy spork. I already know it has to do with my logic, I wrote the code, I’ve profiled it, and I’ve optimized it down to every last level. What I was not expecting however, were for them to insert thousands of lines of data into it. I don’t know what their computers can handle, simply because they have yet to build the data, I’m trying to catch it before it does happen. Let’s say I’m good, as said above, computers can handle thousands of string operations in milliseconds. That’s cool and all, but I still want to see if I could at least get a slight boost from multithreading.
Lol mkay pal. Keep optimizing your _thousands_ of lines of data.
This video is going to be 4 hours, as I am going to record me building a complete C# application from the ground up. I saw a video on YouTube that is 2 months old and getting 3,000 views per day and it is a 24 hour C# complete build an application walk through. I am guessing at 4 hours, I know I could build what I am building in a few hours, but explaining things to people that have never done it before it will probably take a while longer. The app I am building is called Git Trimmer, because I know my repo has a lot of .jpg / .png files in the solution that didn't end up being used in a project. This demo will: 1. Create a SQL database - with an all stored procedure data tier 2. Recursively scan all .jpg / .png files starting at a given folder and save them with info like path, type, filesize, etc. 3. Find all solution files .sln recursively from a given start folder (this project is only for C# repos) 4. Read solution files and find all projects included 5. Read Project files and scan for the included files from and update the files found in step 2 with 'IsProjectFile' and some other project info. 6. Move all files that were not found to a given folder outside the repo. I think this will make a good demo since it performs a function I need, but also my workflow is probably unique as I have a some project templates / and open source projects that are also now NuGet packages to make them easier to deploy so make building projects like this pretty simple. And this intro I showed is only for this video, although the class room scene that I already purchased / modified I will reuse in different situations for each video. The one thing I like from this video regardless of all the criticism is the part where I take the first 5 seconds of a video and place it on the projector screen as the camera zooms in, and then when I switch to the screen recording, the first 5 seconds is the same last 5 seconds from the animated into as a transition. Comedy writing / animating is really what I want to do, but I have 20 years of programming experience and lots of code that was dying on my hard drive, so I gave it away open source. 3D animation is just a way to help my videos get noticed, as Google only likes to recommend popular videos, and to be popular people have to be aware of you, then like you or hate you. Watch half of a couple of Alex Jones videos and Google categorizes you as Alt Right neocons or something. Giving away free code is harder than it should be; Google Ads cost me $5 per click to try and give away something away for free, so I can't do that any more. Martin Scorsese I am not, but animation is fun is why I do it.
At least I know how to eat upside down gum balls and give rectal exams with crayons you hairy lobster.
good job man keep it up, dont think too much abput critism just keep learning and be happy
Why? You iterate over it once only? And directly converting form list to array is fast. The whole thing about order I don't get. The order stays the same.
Arrays have a fixed size. I don’t need to convert the list to an array if I already have a list of data... I don’t think you get it.
Tim Corey's videos on SOLID and Interfaces really helped cement my understanding of interfaces and polymorphism. Recommend checking them out.
You can't work parallel on a list without locking. In an array you can. Here is the pseudo code: var yourArray = yourList.ToArray(); Parallel.Foreach(yourArray, (value, pls, index) =&gt; { var resultString = DoSomethingWithTheValue(); yourArray[index] = resultString; } //foreach element in array append to file

Make a library for requests and then use it to make a CLI and GUI interface.
Reason why it logic would be inside console application is that in the future if we want to change switch language for the GUI application, we would still ne able to use the console application. I hope I make sense

I just started using Electron with TS and c# backend. The library for communication is called 'electron-cgi'
I am redoing a project I started many moons ago - a game server control panel. The old version of the project used Hangfire to spawn out jobs to "agents" (windows services to do the actual work like process spawning and updating). It also used entityframework for storing server details. This time im hoping to use RavenDB for storing server details, SignalR for notifying agents that someone has requested an server update/restart etc. I also recently created a utility library and stuck it on Nuget - https://github.com/stevu236/chiaki its nothing special right now, but if its useful to anyone, feel free to give it a go! I need to create docs sometime - right now it adds some useful string/enumerable extensions
Named pipes, host a REST API in your console app, or use standard in/out for communication
Sorry but what do you mean by the "or" do you mean use named pipes or use standard in and standard out? Which one is better? Thanks 😎
I'm building my first PowerShell module, MilestonePSTools. Our company has a free .NET based SDK and our software is very extensible, but automating maintenance/configuration tasks via C# is cumbersome and out of reach for even most IT folks. I decided to write some cmdlets to do all the heavy lifting for authentication and working with objects in our software. With surprisingly little effort, I was able to wrap a lot of SDK functionality in a number of cmdlets. Our professional services team had an on-site engagement a couple weeks ago and the module was able to reduce 60+ hours of manual data entry tasks to about single work day, giving them time to spend on more important tasks. Building cmdlets is a lot of fun, but now I need to learn how to properly document my binary module.
Named pipes would give you a more structured way to do interprocess communication, but it may complicate things if you switch languages or technologies that don't have good support for them. You could conceivably redirect the standard output stream of your gui app to your console app to send it commands. You'd have to do the same in the other direction for responses. If you need full request/response, I would just host some rest endpoints in your console app using Nancy and Owin and call them from the gui app.
It's not really reserved for anything, it's a general purpose cryptographic processor. Although it's *really* painful to use. I used this for the heavy lifting: https://github.com/microsoft/TSS.MSR And interacting with the TPM still ate up most of my time on that project. I reserved 80 hours for this project. Getting the TPM interaction working correctly took 55 of the 80 hours of project time.
Oh, well - nice work for figuring it out, and extra bonus points for writing down the solution for future generations. Nice work man!
I only looked in the X version, there are a few things I'd change. &amp;#x200B; In playgroud.Tests.X you implement IEnumerable when actually you just need a method that returns an IEnumerable. ChickenTestFixture implements IDisposable but doesn't use it. ChickenTests doesn't use IDisposable either. TDD doesn't encourage implementing stuff until you use it. &amp;#x200B; "HatchEgg\_AfterEating\_JustEnough\_Worms\_Ok" does not have enough information in it for me to assert that any change I make to it is valid or invalid. If I go to Chicken.cs the LayEgg method sort of makes sense, but again, I have no clear business rational. Add clear comments to the test that explain why this decision has been made. **Comments explain why, the code explains how.** "HatchEgg\_Ok" has spelling errors (epxectedEggCount, chieckenType) which would not confuse me but would make me question if you knew what you were doing. English might not be your first language, but you can add a spell checker extension with the language you're using for the tests. I work with Europeans who speak English better than I do, so I would bring this up as a thing to fix, but it's completely forgivable. &amp;#x200B; Program.cs has nothing in the main method, so even if the tests pass, the program won't actually do anything. &amp;#x200B; Chicken.cs has a LayEgg method that increments \_eggsLayedToday before some business logic and the actual creation of the egg. This means the egg count could be off if any of the intermediate steps throw an exception. Again, no test for this. &amp;#x200B; Hatchery includes illogical logic. A lazy chicken should use less energy to create an egg? I'll revisit the business logic below, but I'm guessing "energy" does not mean energy, probably time? While I'm in here, there's no need for the temporary variable energyNeededPerEgg, just return a new chicken from within the switch. There's no explanation or tests that explain why lazy chickens need energy of 10, and productive ones only need an energy of 1. If I have to maintain this, I would not know what 10 and 1 represent. Replace both literals with constants that explain this and then update the tests with a business explanation of the constants. &amp;#x200B; ChickenType has no "None" as the default (0) value. This is important because it means any chicken is by default productive, even if it's created wrong. Add a None, and then you can test Hatchery.Create will throw if you pass it a value it doesn't understand. With enums it's best to assume that if no value is provided the developer screwed up. Egg does nothing with IsOk. I get this is just a tutorial, but there's no point adding a property like IsOk if it's not used. This is a fundamental part of TDD. There are no tests asserting its value, so it has no value. Also, no explanation of what Ok means. Comments please. &amp;#x200B; Don't set \_hatchery in ChickenTests, set a \_fixture to fixture. The problem here is the Fixture is going to become a dumping ground for all the crap any test needs. This is a bad, bad idea. &amp;#x200B; You have a chicken that lays an egg regardless of whether it's healthy. IRL this isn't quite how it works. This is important because when I inherit your code I am not going to understand the rationale for a chicken laying an unhealthy egg, especially if I understand chickens. Equally, why does the chicken lay eggs only after eating worms? So again, this isn't how chickens work. When I inherit your code I will be all WTF. &amp;#x200B; Source: I do code reviews.
Thanks!
Wow, thank you! I really appreciate this extensive feedback, as soon as I get some time on my hands I will implement the changes. The code did not really have much logical value to it. I will try to make it more logical to make more else. My point was to illustrate testing, so I didn't really pay any attention to all else. But it would help if I supplemented it with clear base under test.
I guess you have reasons for doing things the way you describe, but why couldn't the GUI app communicate with the REST API directly? You can achieve separation of concerns using class libraries without needing to have a console app middle-man for data access.
You should still be able to access the REST API from an app written in any other language. I still fail to see the reason for a middle-man app.
What is the logic in the “just works” part. Could the performance of that be improved? Strings are immutable which means every time you add or replace you’re making copies of the data. This can add up to a lot of processing. If you desperately want to multi-thread it to see what the throughput improvement consider the following rules to stay (thread)safe. - every thread has its own data, never shares any data with any other thread. This is to avoid locks. - each thread can then operate on the data independently. Once all threads have completed, some code runs to bring all the data together for the report. Try the following: 1: find out how many cores the machine has. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1542213/how-to-find-the-number-of-cpu-cores-via-net-c Lets assume in this example that there are 4. 2: split up the indexes of your “items” list into 4 different groups. 3: create 4 StringBuilder classes, one per thread 4: create 4 worker threads. Initialise them with the stringbuilder for this thread and the indexes of the array allocated to this thread. Start them. Details of how to start threads are numerous on the internet. 5: your main thread then waits for all worker threads to complete. 6: main thread then iterates through the string builders and writes each one to the report. One iteration for each result per worker thread. As you can see. Making things multi-threaded, efficient and (thread)safe is not trivial. Avoid it if you can. Good luck.
Why not use gRPC to go between gui and console app? It's so easy to use and high performance.
It's impossible for intellisense to work on false preprocessor blocks?
But I can only have it set to build for one platform at a time, so changing it for one preprocessor block will grey out the others. I just want intellisense to stay working on the non-compiling preprocessor blocks, I assume there should be a setting in VS somewhere.
Yep. It might work on some, but the whole reason the preprocessor exists is to remove blocks that don't compile on the current configuration. Intellisense ain't going to work right if you're missing all your Android symbols because you're set to iOS.
I'd suggest using Visual Studio Code and the dotnet CLI for .NET development on a Mac. I think it's a safer bet that Microsoft will be more current with it's tools for .NET development than Jetbrains.
For over a decade, every single interview I have, at some point the interviewer looks like they're about to say something really clever, and they ask "what is polymorphism?" It's the ability to subclass things. It's really that simple. It pisses me off they've come up with a twenty-five-cent-word for "subclassing" and they treat it like this word is some big important mysterious thing. So now when they ask I say "It's the ability to subclass things," and if they say they want more information, I ask "what more do you want me to say about it? It's pretty simple, one of the base concepts of object orientation. It's *supposed to be* simple."
Question: what exactly code like this does? &amp;#x200B; private Dictionary&lt;string, double&gt; OrderSentenceVectors(Dictionary&lt;string, double&gt; assignedVectors) { if (ShouldFavorLowScores) { return assignedVectors .OrderBy(vec =&gt; vec.Value) .ToDictionary(vec =&gt; vec.Key, vec =&gt; vec.Value); } else { return assignedVectors .OrderBy(vec =&gt; vec.Value) .Reverse() .ToDictionary(vec =&gt; vec.Key, vec =&gt; vec.Value); } } &amp;#x200B; Dictionary has no order. Ordering dictionary, reversing values and then creating dictionary out of that does exactly nothing. Am I wrong?
 That is by design I would imagine./
This may be nitpicky, but you should never stop studying if you want to remain relevant as a software developer, no matter how many certs you get.
Hot damn! Thanks for this
I have an open source graphics program called Transparency Maker, that reads in a bitmap (jpeg or png to be specific) and creates what is called a Pixel Information database. &amp;#x200B; Here is the Save code if you find it useful. &amp;#x200B; `// Get the background image` `Image image = this.Canvas.BackgroundImage;` `// Create a new instance of a 'Bitmap' object.` `Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(image);` `SaveFileDialog dialog = new SaveFileDialog();` `dialog.Filter = "*.png|*.png";` `DialogResult result = dialog.ShowDialog();` `// Save the bitmap` `bitmap.Save(dialog.FileName);` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (If you want to know more about Transparency Maker, read on) Then I run queries against the database using a language called BQL (Bitmap Query Language) that is so close to SQL that if you know SQL you know BQL. You can then write a query like: Hide Pixels Where Total &gt; 700 X &lt; 200 Red = 243, etc. &amp;#x200B; There are some Update queries also, but eventually I want to do some of the things you mention like create an Eraser tool, and a Masque tool where you can run a query to update, but the items in the Masque do not get updated, or only the items in the selected area get updated. It sounds like some of what you want to do would benefit me and possibly some of what I have already done would benefit you. The Pixel database is a way to manipulate images via numbers, which sometimes is better than graphical programs. But everyone I have showed it do wants little sliders and controls to do all the things I do in queries. &amp;#x200B; If you want a full working demo, Transparency Maker is currently part of the Data Juggler Shared Repo which was all my code shared under one large repository. I got motivated this morning and move one project DataTier.Net to its own repo, but until I have time to move them all you have to clone the Data Juggler Shared Repo to get Transparency Maker. Later this month it will be separated out whenever I get extra free time. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/DataJuggler/SharedRepo](https://github.com/DataJuggler/SharedRepo) &amp;#x200B; If you want to watch a video of Transparency Maker, here is one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEgFwgBwNQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEgFwgBwNQI)
Certs won't do anything for you except maybe look good on your resume. If you truly want to become a better developer, you will read articles, books, docs and blogs to increase your knowledge and stay current on changing and emerging technologies.
Thank you for this.
I found a work around in the mean time for anyone interested in the future. Every time I use a preprocessor, I include "|| UNITY\_EDITOR" so the proprocessor blocks are still true while editing, and intellisense works on them again. This is still not optimal though because platform-dependent code in the blocks will always run when testing in the editor, potentially throwing errors, and requires additional code to check the platform at runtime instead, using Application.platform: &amp;#x200B; `#if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_ANDROID` `Debug.Log("Code here runs in editor and on Android.");` `if (Application.platform ==` [`RuntimePlatform.Android`](https://RuntimePlatform.Android)`)` `{` `Debug.Log("Code here runs only on Android, but intellisense still works.");` `myPlatformSpecificCode(); //Only runs on platform, and intellisense still works if build settings not selected.` `}` `#endif`
Sure are. The reverse of the order will return a dictionary with high values on top of the collection.
Always welcome :) It's why we do code reviews and help each other out. It's just a perspective change. BTW, you don't have to accept all of what I said, think about it critically and go from there. Ask questions if you're not sure :)
Great resource! Thank you for sharing!
Yeah. The request was that they need Console application and GUI application. I'm just trying to make it most pain free. Do you have some other suggestions?
Depends on what you're generating, from what source, and whether you consider 13 an unlucky number.
To add to that, there's no guarantees of where preprocessor blocks can go. They can be literally anywhere: even in the middle of expressions. If every block was always interpreted as active, then there are times when the resulting code wouldn't even parse properly, much less get to semantic errors. Add to that the fact that this can affect things like definite assignment, as well as IDE analysis features, and it's a non-starter.
An excellent post. I wonder how well your ideas fit in with commercial pressures to get the job done? I think for trainees/apprentices/etc who have time to experiment, it's excellent advice, but I think in the real world, sticking to known patterns *unless they're shown not to work for your scenario* is a better course of action. But my job is in teaching, and there are definitely lessons I can learn from here about how I teach patterns. I've always taught them as "this is how it's done", whereas you've made me think that I should add some more critical thinking into my lessons.
I can’t go too much into detail but I’m building something close to XML and JSON.
Well, like I said, with a console app, you're just adding a pointless layer. No matter what language or process you use, the app will still need to get data from the REST API and I don't know of any relevant, modern language that can't communicate with a REST API.
I do code reviews myself and I did a lesson about testing and I mentioned that the code under test is quite bad. Like eating and laying eggs is coupled, iffy logic, etc. I do need to amplify the point with proper examples. Thanks again for feedback 🙂
Ahh yeah. But they said that they need console application so they can run it in well in terminal.
I would say that yes, 13ms is fast. It's always fast. Question is, how does your generator do give a really big set of work to do? Point being, you should do some stress testing and make sure it still functions/performs the way you expect.
That is what I intend to do but that requires me to handwrite thousands of lines of data for it to accept then serialize.
13ms seems pretty good. My code generator generates C# based off a PLCopenXML file (used for industrial control systems) and generates around 1000 lines from a 30mb XML in about 1.5 seconds. Would be interested in how you did formatting as my code is a mess when generated. The user doesn’t get to see the generated code though so not sure if it really matters.
Depends on how it scales and who's consuming it. 70 lines is really a trivial generation so from what information you have provided it's hard to tell much. I mean, 2^N is horrible algorithmic efficiency, but for N=8 who cares?
You would love this then because the language is based on C#. It includes a serializer and deserializer in a single library.
[removed]
Yeah, sometimes people want things without really understanding why. It sounds like they just want some generic means of supplying data to any application. Well, that's what a REST API is. By adding the console app, you're adding unnecessary code that will have to be maintained and can be an additional source of potential bugs.
Always welcome. When I do code reviews normally we'd be chatting, so this will always feel a bit more brutal than it is :)
The last part of your comment, I’m very interested in learning more of what you’re talking about.
 [This is always my worry.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png) There's not enough information here to make any sort of rational assessment. Focus on what, specifically you want to achieve, and then we can dip in and help :)
Oh, I’m not trying to make a standard. I’m just building a library for high performance data storage and serialization.
Basically, if for every input item it takes twice as long^1 that's bad, but if the input only ever contains a couple of items it doesn't really matter. [This Wikipedia article] probably explains it better. ^(1): Obviously just an example.
You certainly haven't given enough context, but I would expect something generating so trivially small as 70 lines to take microseconds, not milliseconds. I can make several HTTP calls, hit a relational DB and/or redis and/or memcached across the network, run a nearest distance search across tens of thousands of locations, and assemble more than 70 lines of output in less than 13 milliseconds.. and 90% of that is waiting for I/O to complete.
Yeah. You're right
I think your timing is way off.
This poses the question of what type of data you plan on accepting and serializing if you say you will have to write it all yourself? Are your hopes that this will be accepted by the Internet and with a bit of luck other people will write your data for you? Not trying to be an ass just pointing out that XML and JSON are already pretty easy formats so cant see anyone switching to something new because it's "10x more simpler to use".
So maybe it's not possible for VS on some fundamental level? I just didn't think it was much different than a simple if statement.
No, you misunderstood me. It takes days from a file, deserializes it, and so on. Users can add to that data and serialize it back into the file. Obviously. What I’m saying is that the language I have created is new, I can’t just go online and copy and paste a huge snippet and test it. I have to write the file myself.
Guess I'm still not getting it. &amp;#x200B; You're so vague about what type of data or code you're working with its hard to understand what you are trying to achieve. If the "code generator" generates code, what does it generate the code to and from? Because if it doesnt generate code from an already widely used (and available) format nor to, what is the purpose?
The question is: what’s wrong with the standards that already exist? If you aren’t making a standard, you should probably be using one...
While I've written many benchmarks (https://i.imgur.com/7FNdwdM.jpg), I don't have any covering concerns that wide. Just a few hundred million handled requests a month that do exactly that, and a billion more a month that do not exactly that. Think whatever you want. 13ms is long time on a CPU.
Google has a binary transition standard for exact that purpose.
Well, I'll give you a concrete example of something that can go wrong: ``` class C { void M() { // Example 1: Definite Assignment string s; #if UNITY_ANDROID s = string.Empty; #endif s.ToString(); // If UNITY_ANDROID isn't defined, this is an error // Example 2: Intra-expression. string s2 = s. #if UNITY_ANDROID ToString(); #else Concat("Hello World!"); #endif } } ``` For the second example, what the heck would the compiler even parse? `Concat` isn't valid in that context. And if there was a `Concat` method in that class, then suddenly the meaning of the program has changed. This gets even worse when you start mixing different variables in the same class, such as if you were doing more than just `UNITY_ANDROID`. This simple example might give you the idea that "Oh, the compiler could just create multiple compilations, one for each define, and then interpret each individually." That's not the case: sometimes code can depend on multiple of these preprocessor defines to compile correctly, and the compiler can't very well try every combination in succession until it finds ones that succeed. You might very well be in the middle of writing code and _none_ of the combinations succeed, or perhaps a combination of variables _does_ succeed but you never intended to have those combinations active at the same time. TLDR: Preprocessor defines are hard.
Looks good. I made a WPF [replacement](https://emi.is/?page=solutions&amp;solution=emi-user-controls-library) for the OpenFileDialog control.
If you want an auto-generated REST api, I suggest you try [Windows Communication Foundations](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/basic-wcf-service-step-by-step/) over localhost. I've done this before in a similar scenario. I wrote the REST api Console side and then added the service in visual studio on the GUI side (which auto-generates all REST api code). Once you've written the WCF host side, you can navigate to it with your web browser and it contains instructions on how to use the REST api. Once you have confirmed that your REST api is up and running you can [auto-generate code in your client application as a service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/data-tools/how-to-add-update-or-remove-a-wcf-data-service-reference?view=vs-2019).
I agree with this. Thousands of strings is not a lot, please find the bottleneck in your application first.
[removed]
Is speed the important metric? When I've had to write code generators, it's because the verbosity of CodeDOM or Rosyln makes large projects untenable not because they're slow. Where are you using this generator that performance is so critical? Is this actually a compiler? Could you just skip straight to emitting MSIL?
It may help if you actually presented a use case for this. You’re being vague and I’m sure there is a reason, but you seem to just keep going in circles when asked for more details. Just come up with some contrived use case that is more substantial than what you have already said—put another way, pretend like the people you are asking cannot actually read your mind and don’t have knowledge of your context.
It's not overkill it's the good way To do it.
I’m well aware of protobuffs.
No it isn’t you ass wagon. And this is in a shitty laptop, not a multi thousand dollar server.
In my experience they can quickly become a maintenance nightmare. Creating one for something that simple seems unnecessary to me.
Yup!
Hey, I've got a question you might be able to answer. I had a play with Blazor and it rendered everything as HTML in Chrome. Is this normal, or some sort of fallback mode? It did download a bunch of .net things, but I was expecting a blob that I wouldn't be able to debug directly, let alone see what it was doing. This was in a corporate environment, so I'm guessing some things are blocked, but the idea it can still render a site is both weird and nice. &amp;#x200B; Thanks :)
It's still HTML. Blazor creates webassembly to replace javascript.
That’s exactly what it is supposed to do. Think of Blazor as an analogue to JavaScript. It manipulates the DOM based on your c# code instead of JavaScript code.
&gt; Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming It should also be mentioned that you can have polymorphism in non-object oriented languages that don't have classes, and this is particularly common in, but not restricted to, functional programming. You can have ad-hoc polymorphism through function overloading and/or argument pattern matching. You can have parametric polymorphism with generic argument types (eg `map`), and you can also have type classes (not OO classes, but algebraic data types)
For the purposes here `r/csharp` we are talking about Polymorphism in OOP.
Thank you :) I know there's an API which connects JS in the browser to the Blazor component, and this is what baffled me.
If you mean you saw raw HTML code, something went very wrong. If you mean the DOM looked exactly like a web page with JS would: yes, that's by design. Blazor is an SPA framework like Angular or React, except you write it in C#.
This is what confused me. I expected it to like Silverlight.
Yes, but C# is incorporating a lot of functional features, and it makes it a lot easier to understand them if you know where they come from.
You can read more about algorithm complexity by reading about the big O notation.
Is this site written in Blazor? :)
...do you have much success in these interviews?
Yes, actually, I average about a $20,000 raise with every job change.
That maybe true. But this is a questions about learning the basics.
Yes they run side by side, but they both have the purpose of connecting the interface to data. Blazor works with JavaScript, but replaces the need for frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. Right now the need for JS to do certain rich client side interactions is still there, but I think as it matures there will be less need to interop with JS.
Awesome!
Thanks man. Let me know if you have some feedback about it.
I don't have anything concrete, but sounds like you'd need the uncompressed sample value equivalents, and then integrate the values over the time period you want.
Not only is subclassing simply one mechanism for achieving polymorphism, it's one the can actively break polymorphism if used incautiously, which is a reason to prefer composition over inheritance.
Thank you :)
Exactly right :) Thank you :)
Looks like VuePress (:
An in-depth explanation of what you're describing here would be much appreciated if you could dig one up. Finding best practices for this process for people without a deep background in crypto was a future effort a few years ago when I had to implement some simple encryption at work.
Just a correction. To have n^2, you’d have for each input n operations instead of for each input two operations. And for op, these equations are used to measure how an algorithm scales with input size (in your case). As in, when input size doubles for example, it’s really bad if the time quadruples or more. Just a quick example.
That's powerful. I'm glad I've helped someone make a change. There will be more on critical thinking.
Weak
The comment I was replying to was asking about &gt; I mean, 2^N is horrible algorithmic efficiency so what are you correcting exactly?
Oh wait. I must’ve mistaken your comment. Sorry. Too late, should go to sleep.
This is some of the dumbest drivel I have sen on this sub or any other programming related sub. Congratulations. You have to post here profiling results for more help. You clearly did not do any actual profiling or else you wouldn't even be asking this question (or would at least post a waterfall/etc).
💓
Is DOM manipulation finally avaliable from pure C#?
Was that last for subjective compensation of proximity effects?
OP is a phoney.
That's the intent with Blazor - the C# compiles to webassembly and replaces the JS to manipulate razor-like web pages
&gt; I wonder how well your ideas fit in with commercial pressures to get the job done? You know, I've experienced two extremes. I've worked in a job where I was completely entrusted to make the decision on my own, and I've worked in jobs where common patterns are forced upon me. I can tell that without a shadow of a doubt, the better result was from following my own choices. However, I can't prove this to anyone as the source is proprietary and tucked away from the community. But, there's a few requirements for getting things right if you're going to go it alone: 1) Time (plenty of it) 2) Trust from your employers 3) Ability 4) Ability to know when you're making choices based on pride or overconfidence.
That doesn't really sound like a great plan. You're deliberately building it in a bad way in case it doesn't work properly and you need to rebuild in another language. So then you'll build in another language, in a bad way, and it won't work well because you've built it in a bad way, so you'll build again in ANOTHER language (in a bad way) .....and on and on..... If you design it properly, you won't need to use another language. The language is not going to be the problem here. The design will be the problem. REST is designed to be stateless. So you shouldn't have two applications (console and gui) reading the same API calls.
Thank you. Very nice. Will look into this a bit.
Which is great because I hate JS.
Is Blazor only for .NET core and not .net framework??
The GUI, the console: they’re just clients. They should consume the same interfaces and render the resulting data appropriately for their user-interface context.
Yes
I came here to upvote Zoidberg
Quote from MSDN [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8) &amp;#x200B; For purposes of enumeration, each item in the dictionary is treated as a KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt; structure representing a value and its key. The order in which the items are returned is undefined.
No offense, but I don't think you know what you are talking about... here is an image [https://imgur.com/a/Fd4GobH](https://imgur.com/a/Fd4GobH) that shows both before the ordering and after the ordering. They are clearly ordered?.
&gt; Also, no explanation of what Ok means. Comments please. Or better yet, no comments (minimal), better naming
My suggestion would be to create your own Graphics canvas to use as the paint target. You can do this by constructing a new Bitmap instance in the desired size and bit depth, then you can use Graphics.FromImage() to create a canvas which draws to that bitmap. From there, Drawing operations call the appropriate drawing routines of the canvas, and The Picture box itself is merely a "view" onto the bitmap. All you do is handle it's paint event and paint the bitmap from which you constructed the Graphics canvas onto the e.Graphics from the event arguments. Have your drawing code Invalidate and Update the picturebox when changes are made and you'll be in business. This also means you can much more easily have panning a smaller "view" over a larger canvas image. This also helps with your specific issue because I don't think you have access to any backing bitmap for the Graphics canvas. In my example you would create a new bitmap the size of the selection, create a graphics canvas from it, and then use DrawImage to draw the desired section of the larger canvas bitmap onto it to create the selected image data. having it movable with the mouse would suggest IMO having the paint of the picturebox also paint for example a "selected area" which you track. When you select another tool or otherwise remove the selection that selected area gets commit to the backing bitmap.
The problem with WCF is it isn't supported in .NET Core which is going to become .NET 5 so essentially, it's going away. Microsoft has made the statement that you should use Web API or gRPC as the alternative to WCF going forward.
Yeah, I'm with you on that. But there's value in comments that explain the why rather than the how. "A dozen chicken in farming terms is actually 14 chickens because of Farmer Barleymow's discounts in the early chicken years" is useful.
Where is the June thread? &amp;#x200B; I just made a June update video, and now I have no where to post it?

Screenshot looks nice but MSDN says that order is undefined. Talk to MSDN :)
It was up at /r/csharp/new, but not made sticky. For some reason, the automod isn't making them sticky that I haven't taken the time to figure out yet so I have to do it manually.
I believe in this context they are staying that the dictionary data structure does not do any additional processing to the order, making the base ordering undefined. You can definitely order a dictionary.
Amen to that
Yeah. This site built in Vuepress. For more real time blazor applications, refer [https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor](https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor)
The crawlers don't execute WASM so they ignore that. Server side Blazor executes that WASM on the backend and sends the HTML output to the client. The crawler has no problem reading this. I am not sure if crawlers totally ignore WASM, just making a wild guess here. JS frameworks have the same problem to some degree.
Debugging can be done only from Chrome Dev tools, and select Shift+Cmd+D to see the Razor code in browser. But it's not fully developed and we have to wait and see for more inputs from Microsoft, may be that's one of the reason the latest upcoming Edge built on Chromium engine. As well as the "hot module replacement" too is much needed now and hoping to see in future.
If I understood correctly, you think I should create a library and create Console Application and GUI application which use that library separately?
Just wingin' it here. Root mean square is a way of averaging the values of a set. So, I guess it would replace calculating the integral of the set.
My colleague said that they don't Google for example has 2 crawlers: one slow one fro html and css and one fast one for js. Since client said is webassembly and not real js, he said probably that's why client side is not well indexed. Are there any plans of search engines making client side pages Indexable?
Yes, that is how it should be done from good design point of view. Console and GUI app are just different views into the same library. As for which Framework, WPF if you need to support Windows 8 and lower, WinUI otherwise.
Thanks!
Fyi, this is garbage collectors and they have spammed reddit with this before.
Nice. I'm quite looking forward to seeing how it pans out. I had/have some reservations/ignorance around how it will integrate with other Javascript. I know there's bidirectional communication between Blazor and JS in the browser, but can Blazor run its own Javascript? I've already seen the usual control vendors creating suites of controls for it, but things like ag-grid are free and work really well.
I didn’t exactly get what you said but typically you decouple cyclical dependencies by introducing interfaces, define the dependency/nuget-free interface in a base layer, implement it in the corresponding business/service layer (possibly including nuget/external references), and then couple interface and implementation in an IOC container registry.
Probably not. It's best to use SSR anywhere you can anyway. It provides numerous benefits. Here are some that I can think of right now. 1. Your initial draw will be quite fast. You're only sending HTML and CSS to the client. The WASM follows later (probably, haven't tried Blazor yet, but it works this way for most JS frameworks). This will also aid those with bad connection. 2. SEO performance as mentioned earlier. It does come with some downsides though. An example would be that it harms the throughput of your server. You are rendering stuff on the server and that costs resources. I don't know how expensive this operation is though.
Javascript clients are interpreted by Google but the indexing is worse than plain HTML. I feel blessed when my competitors make their sites in fancy new crap and drop from the rankings. It happens all the time though. But yes, I asked the same question because SEO is most important for our company, but not having to write JS, ever, is very important to me. The answer was that it is a pointless question; if you want SEO, just do serverside rendering. I think that is nonsense: they will figure it out, they just did not do so yet.
I don't think your infrastructure should be depending on your application layer. Your application layer should do all the business logic, and then tell the infrastructure layer "hey, I need this [user] persisting, here it is". Your application layer should not have a dependency on your infrastructure layer, and should access it via interfaces.
Have they switched from Mono to Core?
Op I understand your concerns. You're essentially saying that you have enough practical experience but are lacking in the theory required to be able to design your own stuff on a more advanced level. I think the answer to this is that: maybe the certifications will help, maybe they will not. I personally got all the way to MCSD and I did learn some things, but its not that big of a deal. If you want to advance further I think your goal should be to get into bigger companies doing more and more interesting and complicated stuff. The certifications are not immensely useful.
That's sad. To what end?
&gt; It’s best to use SSR anywhere you can anyway. That’s dubious. You’re giving two good reasons (startup and SEO), but beyond that, SSR isn’t as good. &gt; An example would be that it harms the throughput of your server. You are rendering stuff on the server and that costs resources. I don’t know how expensive this operation is though. It’s quite expensive. A permanent connection needs to be made with each client using Web Sockets. It’s not going to scale well. It also means you depend on an Internet connection being available. Any scroll, any tap, any key press could have an event handler that hooks into the server side. Some limited form of SSB may continue to exist, given the initial two points you make. There’s benefits to a fast boot, and obviously SEO is useful. But for regular use, CSB will absolutely subsume most use cases once it’s stable enough (it currently isn’t — there’s lots of basic stuff missing, such as a good debugger), probably in another year and a half or two.
Thanks a lot this is one of only two answers someone have understood me. Actually I am writing some complicated stuff in my work. It is about SAP, so it is sometimes complicated. However I would like to developt some smaller applications for myself and selling it in the future. So as I understood well. I can try certification of Microsoft too, however it is not probably what I expect. Thanks a lot for the reply.
I sympathise, I've worked on something similar and it's a pita. &amp;#x200B; If you're going onion, the outer layer will talk to the next layer in, not the other way around. If an inner layer is talking to an outer layer you have a problem (Which is what you've already identified :) ) You can inject the DbContext into your application layer, move all the logic out of the SaveChanges override and call a simple SaveChanges in your application layer within a method that does everything the old override used to do. Your DbContext should know nothing about the application layer.
Have you considered refactoring this code into: ```csharp private void AppendData(string path) { string result = GenerateData(path); builder.Append(result); } private string GenerateData(string path) { string newData = string.Empty(); // About 100 lines of logic that // “just works”. return newData ; } ``` It seems to me that `GenerateData` would be easier to test, debug, profile etc. Since you have separated it into a "pure" function, SRP style. It would be good you were able to make it `public static string GenerateData(string path)` - that would indicate the that logic was indeed "isolated".
The is exactly the way to do it and NAudio has all of the tools necessary built into the library. You grab the sample rate from the Mp3FileReader class, then using ISampleProvider that will give a set of float values and you can run the RMS calculation for any aribtrary timespan.
What kinds of things have you tried so far?
So, it isn't yet?
&gt; Server side Blazor executes that WASM on the backend and sends the HTML output to the client. Nope. It's just standard dotnet core sending html back and forth through a web socket.
Probably because you need to run WASM code before you get any output rendered. Preview5 of aspnet core already runs a pre-render step server side in order to output html directly and be indexed more easily.
&gt;Any scroll, any tap, any key press could have an event handler that hooks into the server side. huh? what? Anyway you can use both of them.
Yes. That is flawed design, your business logic needs to command what needs to be stored/retrieved and in what format. DbContext should be just an executor, lets say transparent to your business layer. You want to switch DB? BL shouldn't be aware that somethin changed.
Honestly, I have no idea what should i do… Could you help me solve these exercises?
Suppose you have `&lt;button onclick="@MyButtonAction"/&gt;`. With client-side Blazor, this becomes a JavaScript event handler that interops with C# in order to call a method `void MyButtonAction()` (it may also be `async` and take event args, but that's besides the point). With server-side Blazor, again, JavaScript is involved, specifically a SignalR client that will, through Web Sockets, call a C# method `void MyButtonAction()` on the _server_. The same is true with other supported event handlers. So if you have `&lt;body onscroll…/&gt;`, `&lt;input oninput…/&gt;`, etc., you will require an Internet connection to successfully run the event handlers.
Inspiring, thank you. I've often struggled with pet projects. I never seem to get anything off the ground and I'm stuck in an endless cycle of reading or watching. I think a fun game would hold my attention.
Oo
 int[,] arr = { { 1,2,3,4,5}, { 1,2,3,4,5}, { 1,2,3,4,5}, { 1,2,3,4,5}, { 1,2,3,4,5}}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) Console.Write(arr[j, i]); Console.WriteLine(Environment.NewLine); } int[] arr2 = { 1, 4, 2, 5, 3 }; Array.Sort(arr2); // sort and output in reverse order for (int i = 4; i &gt;= 0; i--) Console.Write(arr2[i]); Console.WriteLine(Environment.NewLine); // or reverse sort order Array.Reverse(arr2); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) Console.Write(arr2[i]);
The double for loop means one for loop inside the other, both count to 5, one controls the X axis, the other the y, then just console.write the value at that point
They're the ones. It's not a direct explanation of polymorphism, but interfaces (along with inheritance) can be use to utilise polymorphism. The solid videos cover some of the principles you should bear in mind when utilising inheritance and interfaces in your projects. You should try to make sure you have a bit of an understanding of interfaces and inheritance before watching them, but learning about solid personally helped inheritance and interfaces click for me. Even if it doesn't accomplish that for you, the solid principles are well worth knowing about
I've been working on a math library that can do simple math simplifications. https://github.com/65001/AbMath
Personally, I prefer to use [LINQ to XML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-overview) when serializing/deserializing XML. Where I work, we receive XML files representing purchase orders. The XML is read with LINQ to XML and the data placed into objects, which are then saved to a database. XML order acknowledgments are created in the reverse manner. Works great.
fixed it thank you :)
Why is "HasEntrance" in the function anyway? I would remove that and check HasEntrance before the method fires
Sounds like homework! Write down in plain English what you would like the program to do, then code each part bit by bit until you have a working solution. :-)
hmm that would become in my code i think since i got this in a function calling one of the functions. i guess i made bad code, perhaps another way of design is the solution private void CalcNormalContainers() { foreach (Container container in normalContainers) { if (leftSideWeight &lt; rightSideWeight) { if(TryAddNormalContainerLeft(container, shipGrid)) break; } else if (rightSideWeight &lt; leftSideWeight) { if (tryAddNormalContainerRight(container, shipGrid)) break; } } }
Would you recommend LINQ TO XML when serializing/deserlizing more complicated XML with a strict schema. For example, lets say I want to validate values are within a particular range, or that lists of items in the xml are unique based on a certain key? For example, I can use XmlSerializer, and deserialize items as a HashSet to guarantee uniqueness, and I can use constructors to enforce passing in a key. I can write property setters to enforce range validation. Can I do this with LINQ to XML?
It's been a while, IIRC you achieve that through a [DataContractSerializer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-serialize-using-datacontractserializer)
Pass a Func&lt;int,int,bool&gt; into the method, call it isValid or something like that. Then call the function like: AddContainerLeft( contains, shipgrid, (x,y) =&gt; HasEntrance(y,x)); AddContainerLeft( contains, shipgrid, (x,y) =&gt; true);
I am not sure I understand how that is different than XmlSerializer. Does the DataContractSerializer allow you to use LINQ TO XML?
I'm not recommending anything. I don't know all the details of your situation. I'm just giving you another option to investigate.
wow, thank you, do you think it is completely ok for me to use it even [here](https://gist.github.com/RickertBrandsen/933f4de0c1a7137041f78bbac26125f3) (added xml example into gist)
Yes, as I said its been a while, might want to load that example and then add some of your code/models and toy with it. Thats what I would do.
Removed: Spam.
Although someone already posted the solution, this sort of exercise is pretty fundamental in programming (not just C#). You're going to see A LOT of this if you plan on doing more exercises/class/etc. If you're not sure where to start, just start writing code, even if it doesn't compile or has a ton of errors in it.
Don’t personally do any wpf- but this seems like overkill. Update the progress bars in your game loop based on time elapsed from last invocation instead of using a fixed frequency, or if you need to use a timer - set one at a high frequency and use that to update the state of your game (which includes all of its internal “timers”) based on the elapsed time.
This seems like the best way to do it. You can also set the method up to have the func as an optional parameter that defaults to null, and assuming true if the function is null. if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; (check is null || check(posY, posX)))
Another thing to consider is that this function appears to do at least three different things. Usually when a function says "GetXYW", you would expect it to actually get you something. If you extract the search functionality, such that rather than modifying the shipGrid and calling AddValueLeftSide, it simply returned the coordinates. Something like: private (int positionX, int positionY) GetWeightCheckedContainer(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid) { for(int i = 0 ... { ... if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) { return (posX, posY); } } } The calling method can then decide to use HasEntrance or not before calling AddContainer (which can be it's own function now). Each portion of this can now be tested in isolation, as searching for the right coordinates shouldn't have to care about how to add a container.
Look into making them Tasks https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming
Good point about the default; instead of null; default it to the true func. Makes the if statement nice and clean.
For what it's worth, I've never actually used Unity before - I majored in web development and I'm self taught in software development in Visual Studio. I honestly have no clue what a game loop is, I was hoping to create this in visual studio.
Get out of the UI thread and do long running tasks in a background thread.
That's probably a good place to start then. Games have a rather different structure than regular apps, and taking a youtube crash course in game dev could be very beneficial!
It is currently functional, and you can download Blazor and get exactly that functionality today. However, it's not production ready yet, so that's why I say "the intent". Microsoft says Blazor will be production ready when they release .NET Core 3.0.
Well, first you have to have some idea of realities. Everything you do takes time, and if you're doing it every 50ms you have to make sure you're doing &lt; 50ms of work each tick. Each timer has some overhead because it has to call a method just to get your stuff working. And since you have to update the UI, you're going to take more time waiting on marshalling. And if there's any thread synchronization, then sometimes one timer will have to wait for others to finish. So 10 timers ticking at 50ms can do less than one timer ticking at 50ms. It's just a fact. The architecture I suggest works like this, it's similar to a game loop: * The UI is built using a Presentation Model pattern (MVC, MVVM, etc.). I'm going to talk about MVVM. * Everything the UI displays is bound to a property on what I will call "the current VM". * There is one timer that calls a Tick event. * There is a variable that represents when the last tick happened. * When the timer ticks, your method: * Creates a new object with properties parallel to the VM properties. (Or creates a new VM object that will be set later.) This is the "new VM". * Determines how much time has passed. * For each thing that can update when time passes: * Update the "new VM" with the new value. * Updates the "current VM" with the "new VM" properties. So every 50ms timer tick, you update SOME properties, then push ONE update to the UI. This minimizes the time different things have to wait on each other. If the individual things need to legitimately run in parallel (maybe you're monitoring some devices or something), it only changes slightly. Things that take a long time to read should have dedicated threads/tasks for periodically reading a new value and putting it in a property. The "game loop" above will read that property instead of reading directly from the device. You'll always be using a relatively recent value. You also need to pick the right timer. `System.Threading.Timer` is the only one that guarantees it works on a worker thread. `System.Timers.Timer` is designed to work with a SynchronizationContext, which means it will try to call its callback on the UI thread.
Now you have a couple of terms to start googling on then I guess :) If you’re using unity (it’s not clear to me if your are or not, and bear in mind I’ve never used unity myself either) - I’m positive they have a game loop method you can hook into and possibly an abstraction of a timer that hooks into it as well.
Unfortunately you can't have it default to a non-constant value.
There’s a way around that. But seems like it would be more trouble than it’s worth. Anyway given this construction I’d expect that the two existing functions would stay; but the implemention is the generic one. Then these functions take care of calling with the correct func. Client code still has the same level of abstraction; but the inner code is suitable abstracted.
Thanks for the detailed explanation. I am using the MVVM pattern in this app, implementing INotifyPropertyChanged and binding the progressbar value to an int on the ViewModel. My logic right now is using System.Timers.Timer to perform some math and update the progressbar int binding every \~50ms (this was an arbitrary number, I just wanted something small so the progressbar updates appears smooth). I'm starting to realize that all of my work is currently happening on the UI thread, so I'm thinking that the System.Threading.Timer is going to be a better option - especially since I'm just updating a property and letting the binding update the view, and not directly updating the view from the code. That way I can perform the logic in the background and keep the UI thread free for interaction. I have other issues to tackle with this app as well though, such as time persistence between game sessions - say you click a button that takes 4 hours to complete, and you kill the game - I obviously don't want the game running in the background using the CPU for the entire 4 hours... I'm trying to think of a solution to this problem but I'm coming up short. Maybe something with DateTime.Now and TimeSpans, with a class-level timer running on the ViewModel and a background worker calculating time elapsed based on the timespan between button click and the current time at every \~50ms tick of the timer? I'm rambling now, but thanks again for the detailed answer - I'll definitely have to spend some time learning about tasks and threading. Do you have any resources you'd recommend?
You could pass a lambda/func in, then they'd be the same.
Ignore me, there are already a dozen answers saying the same :)
Web developer here that broke into Unity Obviously your path to success is your own, but from a personal POV though, I'm glad I didn't find Unity until after I had a firm grasp of threading/async. Unity hides a lot from the developer. This makes it great for new devs who just want to build a game, but it doesn't do a lot for making people better programmers. The community is often seriously lacking, and most answers you'll find are copy/paste with no context, posted by people with little understanding of how the technologies actually work.
Yes, sure, but we're talking about a different kind of studying. I'm talking about the difference between "reading ten recipes" and "baking ten batches of cookies". Reading recipes will give you some idea of the core concepts, but until you bake about 10 batches of cookies you're not going to be anywhere near consistent. You're talking about the difference between "being an expert" and "being a generalist". The risk of achieving mastery in one thing is that thing might become obsolete. So it behooves developers to always be looking at other technologies *just in case* they need to jump off a sinking ship. But ask yourself. If you had to choose which of these two people is "proficient at Xamarin Forms", which would you pick? * "I have a GitHub profile where I've written about a dozen small applications, I'm particularly proud of the one that interacts with a Bluetooth device I made out of an Arduino." * "I have spent the last 5 years obtaining 14 certifications for Xamarin Forms development. I have read more than 20 books, and 1,400 blog articles." I'd pick the first guy. I know I don't have to train him. The second guy's going to get stuck and require me to assist him for the first few months as he learns all the little things that happen when your project is more complex than certification course tutorials.
If you're not actually performing/monitoring work on the progress bar and it's purely for aesthetics, I wouldn't suggest bothering with any kind of timer in the context of the progress bar Personally I would create an object representing a task, with the start and end time as properties and then calculate the elapsed time using those properties. Have one thread responsible for updating all of the progress bars based off that list/array of running tasks foreach(MyTask currentTask in AllTasks) { currentTask.ProgressBar.Value = (DateTime.Now - currentTask.Start) / (currentTask.End - currentTask.Start); } Or honestly push that into an UpdateProgressBar() method on the task object You can then use a single timer or loop for the UI update. If you're using a timer for UI update ive had better luck setting the delay for a higher amount of time, generally just under what the user would perceive, to avoid wasting resources updating the UI more than what is actually needed
Oh I know. I am not OP, just saw the post and was curious as I've used XmlSerializer before, but I've never tried using LINQ to XML.
&gt; best practices &gt; Repository Pattern ಠ_ಠ
Except for order of args, which you have control over in the call to `isValid`, you can eliminate the lambda: ```C# AddContainerLeft( contains, HasEntrance ); ```
Instead of: ```C# (check is null || check( posY, posX ) ``` How about: ```C# check?.Invoke( posY, posX ) == true ```
First of all: [Game Loop](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) Second: If you want something more code driven, pick up [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net). It's much easier to learn, compared to a game engine and also makes a lot more sense for someone who doesn't know game scripting.
Yep method group is very neat.
Using WPF is maybe not the best choice for a game. It's designed around making desktop user interfaces, not for gaming. You want a C# game engine instead. Unity, Godot, SFML.Net, etc.
I’m no expert or anything at all but wouldn’t a different loop work better here? Like a do (I think it’s do) loop one that does the loop once then jumps to the start if it ends with the condition met
The original snippet returns true if check is null, while the second snippet would compare null to true and return false.
To make it simple could you change up your Container interface (is it an interface? I’m assuming it is) to have an hasEntrance field. For a NormalContainer hasEntrance would be set to false, for other containers you could set that field depending on the type. Then all you have to do is use that second method since it’ll always check for hasEntrance.
Not sure why you're being downvoted. If they're using EF it already implements the repository pattern
Sadly, I never found one good one-stop source for doing things concurrently. I don't think I've ever even seen a blog article suggesting what I just suggested. Instead, I read a bazillion tutorials and had some hard-knocks projects that needed them. Tasks are nice, but I don't know that they're suited for this. What they are *for* is things that will *finish* and you want to do something when they finish. In your case, it's more like you want to keep repeating your calculations every 50ms forever. You can certainly make tasks that start new tasks when they finish, but I think it's more elegant to use the thing that looks like what you're doing! If you want things to keep going even when the program's not running, that's fairly easy. If you're doing like I said and checking, "Is it time to do this?" for every thing every loop, then you have a concept of a "due time". You *could* store that as a number of ms that you subtract from every loop and consider it "done" when it hits zero. But that's hard to persist across sessions. So instead, store "due time" as a DateTime. When the game loads, you're going to perform a "tick". If something was supposed to take 4 hours, and it's been 5 hours, you'll notice that `now &gt; dueTime` and let it happen! This gets tricky if multiples are supposed to happen, but that's just a matter of something like: ``` * If this thing is due: * while $nextTime &lt; $now * Process this thing. * Calculate the next due time as $nextTime. ``` It means your first "tick" is probably going to take longer than the 50ms, so that one probably should happen before you start a timer. That's always the thing you want to worry about: "What if a single tick takes longer than 50ms to process?" Don't worry about it until it happens, it's as hard to work around it from the start as it is to retrofit.
Then how do I re-use certain queries like adding/updating/getting/non-easy-crud actions? I have yet to learn this! If you could tell me how you'd make my day
You're right. I changed it to \`!= false\`.
Repository is a best practice. Just because it’s old doesn’t mean it’s wrong. You also can’t just rely on EF to solve all of your problems
A lot of people will be triggered by the "Clean code, SOLID" and give you downvotes... I think it's a nice showcase of functionality and structure. I like to see a complete solution like this where everything has been wired up and you can see how the it all connects and works together. Not the least all the different plumbing/glue in everything from Azure pipelines to EF configuration to Directory.build.props. It seems like you spent a lot of time figuring all this out and made it simple and to the point. To give you some constructive criticism: 1. It took a bit of time to figure out that everything in Models were basically request/response objects. Maybe the naming could be more intuitive with `-Command`, `-Query`, `-Result` suffixes instead of `-Model`? 2. Can't really see why the split between Application and Domain is necessary. 3. Private `_fields` for injected services instead of private `Properties`. I believe this is more or less the standard and it's difficult to read the code when the injected services are pascal-cased. A question: How do you manage the `.ruleset` file? Is it supported outside of Visual Studio?

But ability to manipulate DOM from C# like ``dom.Add(new Image("http imgur com/..."));``
e.g?
So I think that first of all, WPF isn’t suitable for building games. Others in the thread have suggested alternative tools that are. When you’re writing a game, you do everything on a per frame basis. So instead of using a bunch of timers, every frame you’d get the current time and loop through the progress bars (which you’d associate with a small object or struct containing a start time and total duration), and compute its current progress given the current time. Then you’d update the progress bar visual state manually to reflect this. Not being a game engine, it seems unlikely that WPF has a per frame update method (I could be wrong though), but you could make do by using a *single* timer that goes of every 50ms and runs your progress update code on the main thread. 50ms is a long time in computer game land (3 whole frames at 60fps!) so unless something really weird is going on you should be able to get what you need. However, even if everything is perfect timing-wise things might be a little stuttery because you’re not actually synced up with the applications internal draw loop. Unless WPF has something like JavaScript’s requestAnimationFrame you might just have to live with it. You should really check out Unity - it has a super gentle learning curve, and is more than powerful enough to make the kind of game you’re looking at. I use it professionally for mobile game development and my only real complaint is that it sometimes goes a little too far in hiding complexity that I really need access to in order to hit performance targets.
I could be wrong in my thoughts here, and would definitely like to be informed if these thoughts aren't best practices, but, personally I have found repository useful in the scenario where: You want to have a common/shared solution for the data access layer, using Entity Framework, where logic/queries for reports or what not may exist as exposed methods to callers of that repository. You also have multiple other solutions/projects that may need these exact datasets, or for other business reasons, these are the only datasets you can work with. Without this intermediate repository wrapped around Entity Framework, you have to rewrite the same queries across the solutions/projects and if the requirements and/or business requirements change, you have to go change them everywhere it's being done. Whereas if you know SomeRepository.GetSomeReport() from the repository project is common between all your projects, you just update it there once (commit, rebuild, redeploy new package/library) and update the references from projects that reference it - and you have just one point where that query is written.
It just means that you should create a data access layer separate from your application. How is that controversial? That’s been a good design principal for decades
I have similar problems and it really sucks when I'm changing something that had e.g 1:1 relation to 1:many or even soft delete, but this one can be done by EF filters tho.
Well, what's db context then? :P
Yes. Those folks are what you'd call "book-smart", but struggle when it comes to applying what they've learned from books. I've worked with a few of those types. But I've also worked with people who have been coding for years and still suck at it. I guess my point is it's best not to generalize too much.
Certainly. It's really more a matter of preference. If you're comfortable with XmlSerializer and it does everything you need, then by all means, stick with it.
When I started working with XML, I checked out both XmlSerializer and LINQ to XML. There's nothing wrong with either one, of course. I'm just offering up other options as I believe it's always good to at least know about the alternatives, even if you don't use them.
It’s a start, not a cure. There are plenty of things that EF can’t do
Best name for "Models" is probably DTO - data transfer object (for example LoginDTO). Models in this architecture are actually used to transfer data to client. Difference between Application services and Domain services is described in DDD. But in this example those services are used incorrectly. Application services are ok but domain services should contain only domain logic. For example UserService generates login tokens. That is not domain logic that is actually presentation logic. Also logging is not part of domain logic so it should not be represented as entity (UserLogEntity). Logging should be handled in Infrastructure service (also described in DDD). &amp;#x200B; I feel like the author of this example missed some important concepts of DDD like ubiqutious language. It is very important to use [strategy patterns and not only tactical patterns](http://gorodinski.com/blog/2013/03/11/the-two-sides-of-domain-driven-design/). DDD without strategy patterns is worse than anemic domain model or active record. &amp;#x200B; I would advice author to read [DDD](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), [DDD2](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Principles-Practices-Domain-Driven-Design/dp/1118714709) and [Refactoring to patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Patterns-Joshua-Kerievsky/dp/0321213351) (you overused factory pattern so i guess your OOP skills can be improved). &amp;#x200B; Sorry for my English.
Right. I agree. Having other options is great. That's why I was inquiring about LINQ to XML. Excited to give it a try. :)

String is already just an array of chars, so it gets the char at the specified index. O(1) operation
dont use split. dont use regex using index? indexof? one of those, is always faster
Oh wow, derp, I forgot about that. Is there any online references I can learn more about this from? I’ve tried MSDN but fell flat on my face.
I wasn’t asking about those.
MSDN is the place to go. A lot of people have trouble with it because they expect a walkthrough website, but that’s not what it is at all. You need to get used to reading/searching boring documentation
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3669199/c-sharp-is-string-actually-an-array-of-chars-or-does-it-just-have-an-indexer
u/prod_is_for_testing said it better than i did, but the index function will go down the built in array of chars that represents the string and get you that char. just make sure you dont go past the size of the string or you will get an error and dbl check if it is 0 based.
For your purposes, it may as well be an array I didn’t think it was worth explaining the difference between a char array and a C char*
It implements the UOW pattern

I jsut added the controller code to the post as i forgot to copy it. There only thing i not included is service config adding EF/SQL server on startup and a DB Initializer class. This is whats called when i call my controller 0 bookID "f28fe1f8-b985-402a-ac30-08d6e79da675" name "book1" author null
The web socket-based blazor is confusingly named Server side rendering which in front end development means something else. In Blazor that something else is called prerendering. No need for web sockets just the fast initial rendering.
I feel like ?? true would be more readable.
You're not including the author when loading the book. Look up eager loading.
DbContext is the UoW. DbSet is the repository. Using the repository pattern with EF is an abstraction on top of an abstraction. I remember following that Microsoft tutorial to implement the repository and UoW patterns several years ago and realizing 20 minutes later I had rebuilt pretty much everything EF already does for you.
This is in your Get() method that author is returning null? If so it’s because the to list materializes the values but does not load the relationship. If this was internal to the controller you could use lazy loading in which case it would be a n+1 query when you access authors - or preferably include the relationship via _context.Books.Include(book =&gt; book.Author).ToListAsync(). IMO specific projections (selects and includes) is a much better pattern in the long run vs lazy loading - though it seems tedious at first. Check out the efcore relationship docs - this is all explained there. On mobile so just going by memory here but that should get you started.
Yep. My guess is prerendering will eventually come to CSB.
He's taken data structures and algorithms, basic programming concepts and some art classes, but he hasn't learned any actual game stuff yet. This was mostly me trying to get him to work on stuff outside of school, because he spends 110% of his free time playing games instead of learning how they work. I wanted to make a team project to get him interested in programming and help him learn in his spare time

WPF is almost certainly not ideal for making games, but it's what I'm most comfortable with and mostly this was just a proof-of-concept thing and something to tinker with - I'm not planning on making a full fledged game. That being said, I wasn't even aware of game loops until earlier today and after implementing a basic one, I was able to get 3 progress bars to update simultaneously at different rates from each other so I think the "proof of concept" part has passed. In regards to Unity, I can't seem to even get it to open - they forced me to create an account to even open the software, require an active internet connection to use the software, and the software crashes and closes itself whenever I use it while connected to my vpn, so I don't think Unity is going to work for me. Anyways, I may spend some time next weekend exploring alternative game engines and maybe starting to create an actual game, but for now I'm content having gotten as far as I did. Huge thanks to you and everyone else on this post. P.S. if you have any advice on using Unity without being spied on I'd love to give it a shot.
That's literally the definition of every programming forum ever ;) "It's ok, I solved the problem." Serious question, what do you do with Unity now? Are you involved in a commercial endeavour? This might sound daft, but I've been considering Unity for a business app that requires a lot of real time data updates for 3D visualisations.
That’s likely happening because of serialization and not efcore. Book has author, author has book you have both now. What I would suggest is to formalize a contract of what the API will return and project to that - don’t return ef objects directly, that will save you a world of pain the the future anyway. See - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19467673/entity-framework-self-referencing-loop-detected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19467673/entity-framework-self-referencing-loop-detected)
Hey, can I recommend RX for the timer? It's really easy to test because you can advance time. So if you want to check a timer fires every 10 seconds (I know this is game loop, so a bit quicker ;) ) you can use the test scheduler to just say "Add 10 seconds and see what happens". I don't know what its performance is for a game loop, but I'd be surprised if it was slower than a basic timer. &amp;#x200B; It's been a long time since I did a game loop, so take all of this with a pinch of salt. This comment is well seasoned.
So I agree with you about tasks not quite being what I need - it turns out that a game loop would better serve my purpose. I created a simple game loop (a 10ms timer inside the constructor that calls an Update() method on timer.Elapsed) and inside of the Update() method I set the values of the properties. I currently have 3 progress bars updating smoothly on the UI and the buttons and window frame remain active so I can drag the window around while it animates itself. I'm going to look into maybe using Unity or another game engine instead of WPF, but for now it would appear that multiple timers is no longer the best solution, and instead to use a single timer to trigger an update function based on elapsed time. I'll still need to do something about handling events after the game was idle (say a 2 second job runs automatically, what happens after 6 hours of away time? Somehow I need to calculate the new number of "items" generated during that time). Anyways, the proof of concept part of this project is completed, now I have to determine the best way to move forward. Thank you very much for your help kind Redditor :)
It still runs on the Mono runtime compiled to WebAssembly, but it uses the .NET Core Framework and Libraries. It will likely always run on Mono, since they are unifying everything with ".NET 5". The reason Mono was chosen is because it is written in C, and there is a readily available C -&gt; WebAsm compiler, so bless refactoring was required.
Working on a few game projects. It's a lot of fun and it helps switch things up for me. I find in the long run it's best for me to practice many different development styles regularly (web/gui/cli/unity) because it helps diversify my problem solving and a lot of the challenges and lessons are transferable. Desktop and unity development has help keep me performance minded when working on web applications. Web development keeps me focused on object scope and "request" life cycle, and I think a lot of unity devs could benefit from leveraging DI and reflection more.
Not exactly as such, currently, I don't think. As far as I'm aware, DOM manipulation as you describe is done in C#/Blazor through an interop with JS: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/51665.blazor-understanding-javascript-interop.aspx The good news is you needn't write JS, the bad news is that the JS is still involved.

So cool. It's so easy to get into a predictable cycle and I admire the context switches :)
I read somewhere that it is in the current preview.
&gt; What I would suggest is to formalize a contract of what the API will return and project to that Apologies, it's been years since i done some proper programing, could i ask you what you mean by the above statement? Thanks
Make a class (or set of classes) that explicitly states the return values from the controller, then use select/include/whatever to explicitly copy to those classes and return that. Include the properties you want, and leave out the ones you don’t want to expose. Basically DTO’s for your API.
Yes, I think you're right. ```C# check?.Invoke( posY, posX ) ?? true ```
So basically somthing like viewmodel to abstract the indivdual modes?
Exactly!
Use one timer with a precision equal to the GCD of all your progress bar intervals.
Good idea in theory, but in practice it wouldn't work for my specific use case. After a certain point the GCD would be &lt;1ms and timers can't operate at that precision. I ended up implementing a simple game loop where it performs all of the update logic about every 10ms based on a class-level datetime and a time span difference between datetime.now and each specific progress bar's interval.
&gt; The issue seems to be that it's evaluating ElapsedMilliseconds every single time the timer changes That's not how it works. You have a `while` loop and that will keep evaluating the condition and executing the body of the loop until the condition becomes false. It doesn't know anything about timers and so it will keep running constantly, ensuring there is no time to draw the UI. With a timer, you would put the code that's in the body of the loop into the callback. But a simpler solution might be to use `async`-`await` and `Task.Delay()`, e.g.: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 80; i++) { // set progress bar value to elapsed time / total time await Task.Delay(50); } //time elapsed logic, update inventory and reset button state (Next step could be to realize that timers are never completely accurate, which means that 80 * 50 ms might not be exactly the same as 4 s and handle that.)
Only ever bookmarked this, but maybe you will find it useful: http://www.albahari.com/threading/
If you go the complicated route, you could implement an event-based scheduler. One single thread that runs the “loop” and you can register event handlers with it and specify a time at which each event needs to be fired. From there, your loop logic could figure out at which intervals to fire off each event. The event handlers (when invoked) could be executed on the UI thread, giving them free reign of doing quick updates without freezing the UI.... Or you could just use an existing game framework as many others suggested. MonoGame and Unity are great recommendations.
msdn is outdated, you'll find the new documentation on docs.microsoft.com
Strings are always an array of characters. That's the definition.
Yeah, I had given thought to an overload too. Generic parameters just seemed like the more widely used thing nowadays. private void AddContainerLeft(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid) =&gt; AddContainerLeft(container, shipGrid, (x, y) =&gt; true);
You can use dynamic rendering and provide server side Blazor version of your app to crawlers/bots using User Agent detection while still providing the client side Blazor app to real users. There is a demo on GitHub that has the same Blazor app using both Client Side Blazor and Server Side Blazor. https://github.com/Suchiman/BlazorDualMode Also, an interesting tool: https://github.com/rendora/rendora
How are you ending up at sub-1ms GCD? That would mean you have fractional-ms intervals in your other timers, meaning you would require a timer(s) with sub-1-ms precision, which you yourself isn't possible with your tech stack. Something doesn't add up. That said, your solution also works, a single higher-frequency timer that counts all events in the previous tick and interpolates between the tick will solve your problem nicely, glad you figured it out.
ToCharArray does a copy, because if it gave you the underlying array, then you'd be able to modify it and the string wouldn't be guaranteed to be immutable anymore
Not quite correct. ToCharArray does a copy because they have to convert from unmanaged char* to a managed c# array
You should be careful with saying “always” because sometimes it is important to note the differences between a managed array and a char*
That's just an implementation detail, they could have used a managed array internally. Either way they would have had to copy the elements due to the immutability issue
But those are both types of strings. In C++, for example, you see there are many types of strings. But they are still all called strings.
I'm not saying I need that kind of precision from a timer, but the type of game I'm trying to create uses multipliers based on elapsed time and certain in-game criteria that, eventually, amounts to some actions happening more than 1000x per second. After thinking about it I've realized that these would definitely be calculated instead of timed, but it highlights the need to not rely on a timer-per-event but instead rely on a single timer for all events to regulate update functionality, and then use logic inside each event to determine the result based on that event's time elapsed, multipliers, bonuses, etc.
Dear lord. Refactor that. Ternary expressions are great at reducing code volume, but usage like this is the sort of thing that inspires crusades against them. I use a tool ([CodeRush](https://www.devexpress.com/products/coderush/)) that has a handy refactoring in it to expand expressions like this back into the If.. Else blocks they represent for easier reading. Running this though it yields the following. &amp;#x200B; if (Count &gt; 1) { if (CustomName != "") { x = string.Format("{0} ({1})", CustomName, Count); } else { x = string.Format("{0} ({1})", Info.Name, Count); } } else { if (CustomName != "") { x = CustomName; } else { x = Info.Name; } } Lot more lines, but a lot easier to work out what is going on.
Ternary expressions are good if kept short. This is nesting a ternary expression inside another, which is all sorts of ugly and hard to understand.
If you have questions about how something works you can always search and look at the source code online. For example here is the string class from .Net Framework: https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/string.cs,8281103e6f23cb5c Or from .Net Core on git hub: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/String.cs
But this isn’t c++. When working with a language, there are expectations for common types. If you say that something is “always an array” then people will assume that you mean a managed c# array and everything that implies
I used to do that until I had to take over a project full of this. I don't do that anymore.
So, that's really awful to read, because a) nesting conditional operators with branches on both paths is *painful* and b) there's a bunch of repetition that obscures things for no good reason. And it's also formatted very poorly (which is to say that it's not formatted much at all). If you format it so that the outer ?: has its parts on separate lines, it will probably be clearer what's happening: return Count &gt; 1 ? CustomName != "" ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", CustomName, Count) : string.Format("{0} ({1})", Info.Name, Count) : CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name; but, all of that can be written as two lines that doesn't repeat the check on the contents of CustomName or the format of the result. var name = CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name; return Count &gt; 1 ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", name, Count) : name; That still has ternaries, but it doesn't have repetition or *nested* ternaries, so you should find it *less* obtuse. It's arguable better to just break the whole thing out to separate ifs and let the returns fall where they may, though: string name; if (CustomName != "") { name = CustomName; } else { name = Info.Name; } if (Count &gt; 1) { return string.Format("{0} ({1})", name, Count); } return name; If you have to keep it as a single statement, you can play some games with string.Format and the conditional operator: return string.Format(Count &gt; 1 ? "{0} ({1})" : "{0}", CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name, Count; Or we could fiddle with conditions a bit so that the nested ternaries flow a bit better: return Count &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; CustomName == "" ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", Info.Name, Count) : Count &gt; 1 ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", CustomName, Count) : CustomName == " ? Info.Name : CustomName; Though I tend to think that works better as actual if-else blocks.
I didn't take the original question here to mean if the System.String inherits from System.Array or something like that. We're just talking about the behavior of System.String in a general sense. Does it store characters in a linked list structure under the cover so indexing is an O(n) operation? Obviously, no. I've never heard of a "string" that is anything other than an array of characters. Sometimes there is some extra information included in the "string" like the length, byte order, etc. My point is just that indexing a string is always an O(1) operation no matter what platform, language, framework, or decade we're talking about because strings are an interface on top of an array of characters by definition.
You're a good person now.
This looks quite interesting. Are there downsides in terms of SEO compared to just server-side rendering?
Well, provided that you detect the bots correctly, I don't see any downsides in terms of SEO. To the crawler, it will load very quickly like any SSR site while the real users get a snappy interactive version that doesn't require SignalR in exchange for waiting a second or two more for the wasm (or client side js files in case of JS based SPAs) to load. SSR might be beneficial to a lot of sites, but for a site with a lot of interactions (buttons, editing, js interop, etc.), SSR might increase user input latency and ruin the experience. To SSR everything or not is up to you. Google's Bots use headless Chrome with known capabilities, they do support JS and (PROBABLY) wasm since they use the same JS engine as any normal Chrome install. But Google disables a lot of features and sets memory/CPU quotas, which means that sites with large assets will be penalized. Google themselves suggest running headless Chrome for the crawlers https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/articles/ssr#perfresults
Shoot the original author in the face and rewrite that horrendous shit.
Just a minor note. Required is not needed on integer keys, as they always end up as seeded or auto increment. They also cannot take on a null value, so they always have an actual value. Key also ensures uniqueness. You don't specify a string length, so if you use a SQL server, your strings will be Max length. You could use [StringLenght(255)] or OnModelBuild override in your DbContext with ...entity...HasMaxLength(255) And 255 isn't a magic number, just an example
The code in the OP treats the case where CustomName is the empty string differently depending on the value of Count. Except for your last attempt, yours doesn't.
Whoa. I like ternary operators, but if you need to nestle them, you probably shouldn't be using a ternary.
How about putting your data as an RTP stream on the network with multicast and using rtp://@ip:port/ as url? Can the components do that? If not I’d look into DirectShow and creating a source filter. You can then specify the window into which the Enhanced Video Renderer component in your graph should render the video.
If targeting .net core, consider using `ReadOnlySpan&lt;char&gt;` and the `.Slice` method. In this way you will make no new allocations, but keep a reference to the string positions passed into the `.Slice` arguments.
Why have multiple timers at all? Just have one thread on a loop with a 50 milisecond sleep that tracks timestamps in a ConcurrentCollection. Then have your main game loop check relevant timers for progress in the ConcurrentCollection. The UI won't freeze up at all and since you need the game loop to fire to render the UI as soon as the timers are up you'll see them on the next game loop. Assuming you have an actual game loop and aren't relying on Windows Form management and the Window Proc message pump to render the game controls etc.
Every major graphics library operates on the concept of a game loop, DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan etc. Games, in the traditional sense are not windows forms applications or WPF applications. They don't have event ques or receive window messages, they use libraries like Direct Draw and Direct Input etc for dedicated hardware support (like running the game in full screen mode). The "Game Loop" is a function that loops indefinitely as long as the game as running and on each loop it's processing the next scene (the next frame), loading sound effects, starting an animation, and on and on an on. Made way easier by modern game engines like Unity. WPF is designed for windows applications that run on top of hardware acceleration using XAML. It wasn't really designed for games. XNA Studio on the other hand was, it's discontinued but it's still a nice game library and you can still use it. There's MonoGame as well (What XNA studio users were told to move to...). Traditional windows applications rob you of a game loop because the main thread is being managed by windows and the windows message pump. So your "game loop" is out of your hands in a WPF app and the application is managed by windows message loops waiting for user input, or system messages to tell it to do something. You can hook into the windows message que by invoking the windows API, but you still can't control any kind of loop on the main thread and to sleep on the main thread will hang your ui. Honestly, I'd look at Monogame over WPF. Better yet, you're a web developer, use WebGl (three.js) and do the whole thing in the browser like the popular "cookie clicker" game.
Reminds me of this time I had to solve a verify complicated issue by writing a Native HTTP Module for IIS (in C++, could not do it in .net with managed module, had to be native) and I knew what I wanted to do could be done, but could not find a single scenario of anyone having done it, except 1 guy. So thanks, Random dude in Russia on random dead Russian forum and THANK YOU google translate.
I'm now using t440P with ssd and 8Gb ram. ThinkPads are best one for developing :)
Yes! I hate it so much when code is so hard to read that you have to use a tool to make it readable. It might be a one liner, but it isn't more efficient folks! Just harder to read and thus, harder to maintain.
That depends on how you define “array” and “character”. If an array is just an IList and a character is any byte, sure. But strings aren’t internally .NET arrays (nor structured that way), and characters may take up multiple bytes.
Also, if you want to check if a string is empty you should always use string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(CustomName) or string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName).
return Count &gt; 1 ? (string.Format("{0} ({1})", CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name, Count)): (CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name); &amp;#x200B; but it's better and more readable to write it like this" String name = CustomName != "" ? CustomName : [Info.Name](https://Info.Name). return name + Count &gt; 1 ? string.Format(" ({0})", Count) : "";
I agree with everyone who says don't do this. It's also worth adding a note on what's going on, though. A standard ternary operator looks like this: boolean ? true expression : false expression In this case, the `true expression` is another ternary: boolean ? (boolean ? true expression : false expression) : false expression But there are no brackets, and in fact the brackets are not required. However: **please don't do this!** It's horrible!
MSDN doesnt exist anymore
It's so satisfying when that happens :)
Another variant (just to chime in): var name = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) ? CustomName : Info.Name; var countText = Count &gt; 1 ? $" ({Count})" : ""; return name + countText;
&gt; Every major graphics library operates on the concept of a game loop, DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan etc. Actually no, they (graphics libraries) don't have a concept of a loop. They just allow to present a buffer to the screen. Usually a game-engine has a "game loop" that has a "render"-pass in it. (mostly at the end, after all important calculations are complete)
Alright. But for sure, using an index on a string is for sure a O(1) operation?
Nope, not targeting core.
I made a small program that will in response to a key press strip any characters that are not valid for a file name and leading / training white space. Mainly for when I want to save a cool picture and want the posted description as the file name, but it includes invalid characters.
it's not confusing, just bad code ternaries are good but not like this. what you should do is change that to if else blocks for readability.
HEIC is old news. AVIF is the talk of the town. Anyway, you can use native interop to interact with libheic.
A .NET string is *neither* a char array nor a C char pointer, though. Its implementation details may vary, and there’s no guarantee the string will be null-terminated*. Nor that it behaves like an array. *) the Windows implementation is actually both null-terminated like a C string *and* has a Pascal string-like length prefix
Not really clearer. You have to wade through a wall of curly braces and duplicate clauses just to find out that x is only getting assigned once, and what the heck is an x anyway?
Only if having distinct code paths is important, and OP has given us no reason to think that it is.
Assuming what you mean by ‘the file itself physically’ is the contents of the file, Stack Overflow and Google are your friends. Posting to an MVC action can best be done by simply making an HTTP request to your own application. How to do that is again answered by Stack Overflow and Google.
The C# spec does however guarantee that a `fixed` `string` gives you a null-terminated `char* `, so in practice a conforming CLR must null-terminate all managed strings, or be forced to create copies of strings in typically performance-sensitive code.
This is the most elegant way I could write it: ```csharp var name = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName)?CustomName:Info.Name; var x = Count&gt;1?$"{name} {Count}": name; ``` This is both concise (2 shorter lines instead of 1 long), free of redundancy, and its clear whats going on.
Never mind, just got home from work and ran a stopwatch on it, reported 0 ms on all 5 tries, fast enough for me. Thanks man.

Looks suiting for r/programminghorror
Ternary expressions are fine particularly if it's one condition you're evaluating for a return value i.e. string result = testvalue &gt;= 10 ? "success" : "epic fail"; Statements like this eliminate a ton of code and do not take any more time to read than an if/else statement provided you are familiar with the ternary operator. It's when you get into nested ternary statements like the clusterfuck in the original post that it looks like you're just trying to show off by writing code that's as short as possible no matter the cost. Even the person who originally wrote a statement like the one above is going to have to take a few minutes to analyze it if they ever had to go back to it six months after writing it. At that point you've taken more time than if you wrote out the statement longhand in the first place.
There are a lot of assumptions that can be made and to some extent whether this is "fine" or "bad" comes down to compiler optimizations. First, the answer to your question though: this is fine. Strings are, internally, an array of chars. Nitpickers might point out "it's not REALLY an array" but it's "an array" in this context because I don't think the differences matter. (One skill few pedants have is understanding when their extra wisdom makes no changes.) So this indexer is as fast as any other indexer, that is O(1). The only thing it might allocate is "a new char" but now we're ready for *my* pedantry. If I were to literally transcribe the lines of code with no thought for performance, I might argue that the literal string "hello" might be allocated on every loop iteration. The compiler could make several optimizations from there. Long story short: I'm pretty sure the C# compiler notices this case and moves the string declaration outside of the loop. Still, I think the "clean" way of writing this kind of algorithm is: string target = "hello"; for (int i = 0; i &lt; target.Length; i++) { char thisOne = target[i]; // do stuff } This follows some *Clean Code* principles and, in my opinion, makes what I'm doing more specific. It also sets up the loop to be easier to perform Extract Method refactorings, since now `target` is effectively a parameter. Alas, I'm digressing. The only other thing that bugs me has no solution. The indexer returns a `char`, which is a struct, so every `char` it returns is a new copy of the original `char`. That's how structs work, there's no way around this. There are some mitigations: structs end up on the stack, so they don't tend to create GC pressure and, in this case, it's mostly correct to say they are consumed as part of the normal overhead of calling a function. Still, the me who started working in Turbo Pascal really wishes I could get an honest-to-goodness pointer to value types sometimes. I don't care if it's nanoseconds. A tiny part of me wants the pride of pointing out I understand when making that decision matters. ;)
This is why I never tell other devs about code golf challenges. It can be a fun hobby and challenge but it encourages this kind of rubbish where people get the idea that less lines of code is inherently always better.
Despite my earlier advocacy of a tool to help you do things in code, I have a feeling this might be a case of a tool getting people into the mess (i.e. CodeRush and/or Resharper). Those tools will often suggest that you can compress If blocks to Ternary expressions and offer you a handy one click method for doing it. I've seen far too many devs who see things like that, take it as gospel, and just do what the tool tells them it can do. The answer to "Why did you do that?" is typically "Because X said so". Always remember, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
Just splitting this into two conditional statements makes the way more readable and less bloated. var name = CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name; return Count &gt; 1 ? $"{name} ({count})" : name; Honestly breaking it up into a bunch of if else doesn't really make it better, conditionals have their place but they should always be immediately obvious. The worst part of this code is CustomName != "" twice, it adds so much bloat.
And thats not even a real issue anymore (unlesss the library does not separate namespaces properly) since we got static usings &amp;#x200B; eg. using static MathF = Some.Library.FloatingPoint.Math;
Good lord. But not the worst I’ve ever encountered. Something that can help with this is some reformatting. For each ? and :, start them on a new line. Indent to line them up under the test condition. if (a &gt; b) ? “Foo” : “Bar”;
Yeah, worded poorly . But the method to build what's going in that buffer is generally done in the game loop.

Depends, I need more context to this question. First thing that pops in my mind is DDD so each bounded context it's own hub/project.
&gt; Invoke wait with that invoke? you mean like this? private bool tryAddNormalContainerLeft(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid) { int roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX = shipGrid.GetLength(1) / 2; for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++) { for (int posX = 0; posX &lt; roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX; posX++) { if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; HasEntrance?.Invoke(posY, posX) != false) { shipGrid[posY, posX].addContainer(container); AddValueLeftSide(container); return true; } } } return false; }
because im getting the following error : https://i.imgur.com/6H9yHmb.png check is a method which is not valid in the context
That’s an interesting point.
Solo learn is good to learn basic syntax, no more than that. For good C# learning, check out source codes of any good library(like Newtonsoft.Json), available on github.
I don't love it and I wouldn't encourage it but I don't think it's *that* bad, either, if your formatting reflects the logic: return Count &gt; 1 ? CustomName != "" ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", CustomName, Count) : string.Format("{0} ({1})", Info.Name, Count) : CustomName != "" ? CustomName : Info.Name; I expect this got evolved as opposed to designed.
I'd consider implementing a more general dialog where the buttons are not fixed with an `enum` but can be freely defined (a collection such as a dictionary). OK, Cancel, Yes, No would just be special cases.
hey thanks for the reply! The problem is this: I have a several network weighing scales connected to a server. Due to IT security, the tablets on the production floor can not access the scales directly. So I was thinking of letting the tablets communicate with weighing scales thru the server using a Web api and hubs.
This formatting only reveals that there's some redundancy going on (asking for CustomName != "" twice). I would rather add some intermediate steps, like: var displayName = string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) ? Info.Name : CustomName; return Count &gt; 1 ? string.Format("{0} ({1})", displayName, Count) : displayName;
Nesting enums in a class makes using them a pain, especially when they're already named the same as the class. Either do MessageBoxButtons or MessageBox.Buttons, but don't make people do MessageBox.MessageBoxButtons and preferably don't put the enum in the class.
You get that error because you can't `Invoke` a method, only a delegate. If you first assign `HasEntrance` to a local variable then the error will go away: ```csharp Func&lt;int, int, bool&gt; HasEntranceDelegate = HasEntrance; if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; HasEntranceDelegate?.Invoke(posY, posX) != false) { ```
Funny, "wading" is how I would describe trying to parse out the original ternary.
Everything is an abstraction. We have to choose the layer we work at. I don't need to know the endianness of the processor to decide if indexing a string is constant time. I need to know if it is "an array" or "a linked list" or "something else". The main reason I'm even posting is conversation threads like this are why I can't answer even simple questions without writing an essay. For 25 years, every answer I've posted on the internet has been nitpicked to death. So now when I post, I feel like I have to anticipate the things that will be nitpicked and address them in advance. Do that for a few decades and you can't discuss bubble sort without some digression into processor architectures or any number of other topics nobody who asks about bubble sort needs to know. So, for novice's sake, when you raise a finger to "well, actually", first take a moment to ask if your new information changes the answer. If it doesn't, you don't really get points for posting hypotheticals that make it harder for the OP to understand the problem by suggesting there are deeper layers.
What you're describing is sort of how every basic, introductory thing works. They have to teach you a lot of boring syntax-focused rules before they can build up to the APIs that actually make things happen. Feel free to step out of the tutorial and go write some code on your own. Reading doesn't make you a programmer, it makes you a scholar. Doing makes you a programmer. So go do things until you can't figure out how to do what you want, then come back to the lessons and try to find things that show you how to keep doing. This is why my favorite book series is the (expensive) Dietel &amp; Dietel ones. They tend to have at least one program you write in every chapter that you type in and tweak to hammer in the concepts they write about. I also like books that walk you through writing entire applications, or where each chapter adds features to the program from the last chapter. Nobody writes that way, and they certainly don't do it in blogs. But it turns out "a program with more than one feature" is a lot harder to write than it seems!
&gt; Strings in C# are immutable, so every time we edit one it creates a new instance, that I understand. However, if I do “hello”[x] with x being the counter in the for loop, what is going on in the background here? Does it create a new array every single time and run through it? Or is this an instant process? The downside if immutability is that making changes can be slow. The upside is that reads can be fast and safe. Indexing into a string is just going to read from the location in memory. Because it doesn't need to modify the string, it does not need to make any copies. Additionally, strings a special because they can be constant. `"hello"` will not create a new string, no matter how many times it is used in your assembly; it will always return the same constant string.
```C# private void AddNormalContainerLeft(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid) =&gt; AddContainerLeft(container, shipGrid); private void AddSpecialContainerLeft(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid) =&gt; AddContainerLeft(container, shipGrid, HasEntrance); private void AddContainerLeft(Container container, Position[,] shipGrid, Func&lt;int,int,bool&gt; check = null) { int roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX = shipGrid.GetLength(1) / 2; for (int posY = 0; posY &lt; shipGrid.GetLength(0); posY++) { for (int posX = 0; posX &lt; roundedUpHalfOfShipGridX; posX++) { if (shipGrid[posY, posX].WeightCheck(container) &amp;&amp; check?.Invoke(posY, posX) != false) { shipGrid[posY, posX].addContainer(container); AddValueLeftSide(container); return; // return statements are to break out of the loop. } } } return; } ```
&gt;wade through a wall of curly braces and duplicate clauses versus trying to wrap your head around one never ending line of code you literally have to scroll to read with a bunch of question marks and colons that imply logical operations? gtfo lol
What u/LegendairyMoooo is trying to say is that READING code is 100x more important than WRITING code. If anyone EVER tells you that saving typing is more efficient coding, they're IDIOTS and you should never accept advice from them ever again. On anything. Seriously, they're mentally defective. The only people who should care about how long it takes to actually type the code are people who are poking the keyboard with a pencil held in their mouth, one character a time. A good computer program will last years and years, but the total accumulated typing time will be measured in hours. Over your career, you will spend 10x to 100x more time READING code than TYPING code. So, any reasonable person will realize that taking a little longer to type readable code is much, much, much better than trying to get super clever and write code with the least number of keystrokes. If this is production code, you should leave that company now. They're doomed.
Futhermore, what such an app probably wont teach you are actual patterns and anti-patterns. Google a bit about antipatterns in C#, and try to avoid them (unless you have a good reason) Also look at patterns other programs of similar kind use. For example, when writing some GUI application, learn about the MVVM pattern. And learn how to write unit tests.
Well, that's bad too. What I'd suggest here is looking at what you're actually trying to achieve, which is two things: show the CustomName or [Info.Name](https://Info.Name), then concatanate the count in brackets if it's greater than one. There's not really any branching paths to it. I'd probably go with something like: `return (CustomName != "" ? CustomName :` [`Info.Name`](https://Info.Name)`) + (Count &gt; 1 ? $" ({Count})" : "");` Maybe, break it up with variables or multi-line concat to taste.
I agree, as he said, you have to go on and write some codes. You can find a lot of ideas to practice on [like this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c45ad79d-76ed-4a27-af82-10dd84e7f883/beginner-developer-c-project-ideas?forum=csharpgeneral).
thank you very much guys.. i finally fixed it :)
&gt; How am I supposed to get good at C#? By doing something with the language. Watching videos will get you about as far as learning core concepts, but it's not going to teach you how to program. That, in my own experience, comes only with practice (I self-taught myself C# coming from a C++ background).
As a complete beginner who completed this 'course', I can say that it is a good introduction but that is about it. I now feel more confident following tutorials and would definitely recommend it as a way to familiarise yourself with C# but you can't really do anything useful with this alone. It frequently tries to push you to experiment and play with the code it gives you which is quite useful as the question and answer style learning can be quite frustrating at times.
Removed: Rule 4.
Google beginner project ideas if you don't know what to build. Choose one, build it, if you get stuck look up the specific thing your need to learn to get unstuck, and then finish building. Containue until you've completed the project. Pick a slightly more ambitous projects next time. Rinse, Repeat. You won't learn without building. Syntax is relatively easy. Learning to put those things together to build a practical solution is the harder part.
Imma beat this thing to death because I'm procrastinating: string.Format() doesn't care if your format spec doesn't use all the arguments, so you can do this: return string.Format( (Count &gt; 1) ? "{0} ({1})" : "{0}", string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(CustomName) ? Info.Name : CustomName, Count); No branches worthy of the name, it's just conditional assignments, and a bare minimum of repetition of variable references. This is what I like the ternary for. Not sure if I'd really write that in a real project or not, though.
This and "build what you would use". I have close friends who could benefit from some nice programs I could write and that motivates me to actually get things done in my free time.
I'm a little late to the party, but I just want to say there are even better refactors available to you. The consensus here appears to be that the problem is the ternary, but the problem is really _abuse of ternary_. Ternary operators allow you to make an extremely clear and concise path of execution without having to scroll, so in a few lines you can deduce the exact set of conditions leading to a given outcome. But, it should still be in a few lines, not a single line. Also, if using a modern enough c# version, you can make this even better. Take the following refactor: ``` // checking IsNullOrEmpty is best var name = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) ? CustomName : Info.Name; if (Count &gt; 1) { // inb4 "oh no there's two string assignments": readability vs performance name = $"{name} ({Count})"; // or string.format if you don't have $"" interpolation support } ``` if you really can't have double assignment, you can keep a nested ternary readable, especially with string interpolation. But you'd get downvoted to heck on reddit for it. ``` return Count &gt; 1 ? !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) ? $"{CustomName} ({Count})" : $"{Info.Name} ({Count})" : !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) ? CustomName : Info.Name; ``` I recommend the double-assignment example over both readable ternary and double-ifs, because in both of the other scenarios you have to maintain !string.IsNullOrEmpty(CustomName) twice, and has the possibility to introduce mistakes if this method changes in the future.
Are you trying to get files from the *client*?
Try to create your own projects, this is the way to become better on one language, try by yourself to create something
Questions will come up by themselves by time and you will realize that many of the things you want to know has already been asked in the past by someone else. The best thing you can do is practicing it, maybe watching tutorials or reading texts that embed programming exercises in them, which you try to solve (and eventually will) and maybe take them as starting points to implement other concepts you already learned. Becoming good at programming takes time of the most of the people, even with big interest there are some things which need to go over into flesh and blood but if you got them, they feel most natural. Not saying that I'm nowhere good but I enjoy programming and even if you won't make it your job or something it can be quite nice to be able to write some code.
&gt;MessageBox — useful window for different GUI frameworks, but you can't find it in AvaloniaUI. A message box is more of a quick &amp; dirty solution, especially as far as button labels are concerned. Having predefined button names like "Yes" and "No" is notoriously bad UI, and such an enum should be avoided. For example, [Apple:](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/push-buttons/) &gt;Use verbs in push button titles. An action-specific title shows that the button is interactive and conveys what happens when clicked. For example, Save, Close, Print, Delete, and Change Password are action-specific titles. And [Microsoft:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/ctrl-command-buttons) &gt;Prefer specific labels over generic ones. Ideally users shouldn't have to read anything else to understand the label. Users are far more likely to read command button labels than static text. &gt; &gt;[..] &gt; &gt;Start labels with an imperative verb and clearly describe the action that the button performs. Also consider something more sophisticated like a task dialog.
Don't judge an algorithm by lines of code, or most things for that matter.
&gt; I feel like 104 lines of code is a lot. I shit bigger than that.
So for something like this it would be normal?
Thank you! Can't wait to recommend your extension to my friends now.
Try to create a simple calculator. That's always a good beginner project.
its more about how your organize it and expose it to consumers. You can break up an implementation into ad many parts as you want. Purists would say organize it such that you have &lt;10 lines of code per method. Usually I just say make sure its readable for the next person. Always try to write and comment like the next person reading it has not idea what was done. After a long enough time, that person is usually you.
Hell no ! If you think you have find the balance between readability, performance, control over the code and features then you are fine.
So what would you guess how many lines of code Newtonsoft.Json or System.Xml carries? This is a ridiculously low amount of code for a serializer. However lines of code is one of the worst code metrics and even the best ones are not able to perfectly distinguish moderately bad and good code.
Just curious, always interested in different countries
That is super interesting ! Never heard of AVIF before .. i have been looking at some examples. is there a C# library for such format ?
Just start writing and using. Don’t follow lessons if you have any coding experience
This exactly. Nothing will keep you motivated like building something that can actually be used.
Do they have source code available?
Don’t do things like that in form constructors. Try putting it in the form’s Load event, for example. May help.
For [Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json), For [System.Xml](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System.Xml/System/Xml)
It drives me up the wall. Years ago work would send me on week long courses and it was so very very boring. It's part going at the speed of the slowest delegate, but also part covering as little as possible so the "intermediate" course gets bookings. If anyone is sent on a course like this, the best way to get through it without falling asleep is to help all the other trainees complete their exercises. It's mentor practice, and that's a really useful skill. I've been asked about boot camps before, paid for by the person who wants to progress their career rather than an employer, and it's just sickening. 2k to 10k to cover the absolute basics. They prey on people by implying they can't do it themselves. &amp;#x200B; /end rant.
That's not the problem. I just created this blank application for testing purposes.
So you tested it outside the constructor and it also didn’t work?
Measure speed and memory usage. Ignore LoC or arch, you can always restructure it later and then **remeasure** speed and memory usage to make sure you haven't broken it. DotMemory have a unit test library which gives good memory stats. I don't think you need to license Resharper to use it as it works on our build server. benchmark.net is the defacto speed test lib.
Yup. Tried on a method on a static class. On a normal method inside the form. Every time i put the wait or await, the application freezes on that line and doesnt download the file. If i remove the wait/await, it downloads, but the problem is i need to continue only when the download has finished.
In my case, I spend 6 months on learning all basics from scratch and next just go as trainee in company. Among experienced people is extremely useful and productive, even if you do not understand most of what they will say
Completely irrelevant to your question, but don't underestimate how efficient and performant gzipped JSON is - you can check this manually by converting your data to JSON and dumping it in a zip file (this has a bit of overhead compared to gzip, but that shouldn't matter on larger data). I'd also be careful with the searching for blocks of data part - that sounds like looking for patterns in data, and it's easy to write an O(n^2) algorithm that way (especially if you're using linq). Basically, you'll want to test performance on stupid large data structures to confirm it doesn't take forever to run. Finally, you might be better of writing it using simd instructions in c#, rather than rust. I don't really know what I'm talking about, but my intuition says that the overhead of hooking into a dll might be non-trivial when you're calling it lots of times on small workloads
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. This is especially true since you are planning to open source the project. This philosophy means that you should place your emphasis on clarity and maintainability. Remember that a compiler drastically changes what code actually looks like when it runs and there is a lot of optimization built around that so you may not even know that fewer lines of c# code will result in a smaller compiled IL code file. Also most of the time code size isn’t the limiting factor unless you are building for microprocessors or imbedded systems with limited memory. When it comes to pure optimization most algorithms favor speed, minimizing complexity, and minimizing memory usage. Beyond that some specialized algorithms will optimize to take advantage of specifics of their runtime or to take advantage of features in the specific processors or environments they will be run on (multi core, pagefile size, cloud applications running on data across several shards, etc). If you are building for smallest code footprint then you should clearly define that when you go open source including your reasons for doing so and any performance trade offs you have made and are willing to make to achieve that goal.
The best way to get good at c# is to make something. You can take all the online classes you want, but they will never get you beyond the very start. Pick something simple you want to make, and research how that would be possible. the first thing i ever made was a program to simply turn off and on my network adapter. if you do follow a tutorial, never follow it exactly always be looking to change what you can. Look for ways to improve what you have already made. The best teacher for you is yourself, and the best way to learn something new is by doing it. If you want to learn to sing you sing, if you want to learn to write you write. Reading about the fundamentals is great, but using them is even better.
All the corefx projects have easy up-for-grabs issues to!
All the corefx projects have easy up-for-grabs issues too.
I like using the Code Playground in the app for when im on the go and want to play with code bits on the go.
Very neat, thanks for sharing!
Based on your questions so far in this sub (yesterday you asked if 13ms was fast enough for a serializer serializing 60 lines, without any more context), it is pretty obvious that you should not write your own serializer, but rather use something that already exists. You are asking all the wrong questions and never giving enough context for anyone to answer.
I've been continuing work on my GraphQL.NET wrapper library -- GraphQL-Core, this wrapper library makes using GraphQL in C# a lot easier, for anyone who has used GraphQL.NET knows it is almost impractical to use for an established project. It has new bug fixes in latest release thanks to users at my org taking interest in the project and finding some issues. My org really likes the project, though I can't work on it constantly due to my full-time role https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL-Core/ https://github.com/Michannne/graphql-core I've learned a ton about open-source software publishing and it's interesting doing things from this perspective. I also started working on a new project which I hope will change how Office interop programs are built, still in the design phases of that one but it will be a much heftier project for sure.
Thanks for the information. Not going for small footprint, literally everything required in order to get serialization working took me 104 lines of code. I just thought 104 lines of code was too much, this is only my second algorithm, my first algorithm only being around 60 which creates table formatted text for console applications and text files. I could reduce my code size even further by splitting parts of it up into functions, because parts of my algorithm have the same code typed in for when a condition is met. Right now it’s just a monolithic function with 0 code reusability, there are quite a few lines of duplicated code.
One of the uses of static in C# is to sort of declare something as "Global and forever". I'll try to explain with an example. public class Cat { public static int MaxAge = 20; public int Age; } Here, we define that all cats have a maximum age of 20 (let's not discuss if this is correct or not), but every specific cat have it's own age. When it comes to my second statement "forever", from the first moment you try to access this variable, it will live until the program shuts down. You can change the variable and so, but you can ALWAYS access it with Cat.MaxAge.
If you don't have any experience nor a relevant degree, they have no proof that you can do any work at all. If you're not getting calls back, it's probably a resume thing. C# is a fine language, but if you don't have any relevant experience, that's hard to deal with. Do you have projects? Have you contributed to any open source projects? If you've been coding for 4 years, how is that experience reflected on your resume? There's a difference between coding a few hours on the weekend and going to a bootcamp as well.
Any static member will be “shared” among all instances of a class, or in the case of a static class, there can only be one “instance” (a static class can’t be instantiated. To get a little deeper into the PE executable; static members are also located in the .rdata section (but that’s really just a nice to knew if you’re into reverse engineering)
How do I put on my resume that I've been programming for four years, but not professionally in a way that would look good? I've got plenty of projects, and put relevant ones in my resume. I'd love to contribute to an open source project, but unfortunately don't know how to go about it, or finding one at my level.
Version control software will tell.
As stated at the bottom of my post, I’m doing this out of fun, learning, and sheer boredom. I am not creating this expecting me to replace an already existing solution, I just enjoy programming and it’s a big hobby of mine. I like writing random projects to test myself and it also helps me appreciate the hard work that Microsoft and other software vendors put into their products. Also, if everyone used existing solutions and never tried creating their own, or tried raising the bar, because everything can be faster, we wouldn’t have JSON or ProtoBuff. What you’re saying is that the team that developed Rust wasted their time because C++ already exists. Linus wasted his time developing Linux which is used all over the world today and serves well for super computers. He never should have made it because Windows exists. Chevy and other car manufacturers never should have made performance cars because the Ford Mustang was the first and already exists. I guess all the people in my list, including others, have just wasted their time doing something they love, what started out as a fun project and a hobby that they had no intentions of trying to be the best, ended up being the best, guess they wasted their time. If we all used the same technology and nothing new was ever created, or people didn’t do things out of fun. You and I would be talking over Reddit by changing vacuum tubes instead of the smart phones and consumer available computers we have today. Everything in this world can be improved, to say other wise and not want to see such change only proves your fear and arrogance of change, which is not only foolish but compromises the experience and performance for everyone around you. You should stop programming, because I can guarantee that whatever you’re working on now, has already been made. Even if your product is better, who cares? Someone already made it which means no one else is allowed to.
 You can't rely on the date a source file was changed because there's no guarantee that any such date would be preserved on source control modification, checkout, clone, compile, copy, deployment. I don't think you're solving the right problem, to be perfectly frank. http://xyproblem.info/ What kind of application is it? Why is the application startup time such a bottleneck? Can a UI run over a load balanced set of application servers?
Location? As in location in memory? No. This is because the OS creates processes which all get their own virtual memory starting with index 0. IIRC this is a security feature too (the other feature being an abstraction feature). I am not sure about size.
Post your resume and google the stuff you don't know how to do. You can't just write "Programming 4 years" Just put what you've been doing for 4 years if you've been programming. Like, what projects you worked on and on what dates.
Also, why is the concept of a spring relevant to the application's functionality?
As I said, inspecting git history is out of context for now. I'd rather go down a multi-project approach to build change config before building the base project versus inspecting git for changes. The reason for not choosing Git is that because I will need to build concrete tooling around that, for example, it will need to know when was the code last deployed, what was the commit at that point, have the current commit number at point of deployment, then get all the file changes between those commits, map them to assembly types, check if the calculations were performed properly. It will be messy and error-prone and no small undertaking.
I am sorry, that I didn't really say what I meant properly. Location and size as in screen location and window size. I'm sorry
I never said serializers couldn't be improved, just that you won't be the person to do it. Sorry. If you want to make it for fun, the do so, but asking questions like is 100 lines a lot or is 13 ms fast, without any context as to what your program does - adds nothing to this community and does nothing to help you in your quest.
Then yes ofcourse it’s possible. Depending on your GUI framework you can set these settings before starting the process which renders the GUI. What GUI framework are you using?

Nobody cares about projects. Your problem is competition. For every junior job, there are literally 400+ CVs and it's still easy to find somebody with 1 to 3 years experience willing to take a very low paying job. It has nothing to do with the language, the sector has a shortage of experienced devs who can come in, sit down, and be productive. The industry has too many juniors. I blame hollywood for it by giving a false message.
I’m not expecting to be the person to do it. *facepalm* That is not what this project is about. The reason I asked the question is because out of the several dozens of thousands of people on this sub, I’m not the only one to write their own serializer. So I was hoping those guys could chime in and share if their algorithm is smaller or larger. If you’re not one of those people, then you provide no value to this post. The only thing I’m reading from you is “don’t create something, use something that exists”. So with that, I’m going to throw away my phone, all of my computers, and go back to Commodore 64 and writing Fortran. See you later.
I did not mention the date, where did you get this from?. All I want to know is if the c# file has changed from the last run to perform some calculations. In a CQRS based architecture, your read model/projections are built using events. Any changes to the view, or addition of new views that use old events will require the events to be replayed onto the projection/view to rebuild it. This is not always the case, but when it is, the startup time can be a few minutes to rebuild all the required views based on how many events there are in the system. The concept of the sprint is relevant, because the end of each sprint, we release to prod. When we release to prod, we currently specify which views are required to be rebuilt manually. And I want to get rid of this manual process by detecting which view/projection files changed from the last deployment.
get a SHA1 hash of the file, store it, then get it again later for comparison.
static doesnt imply global.
&gt; The only thing I’m reading from you is “don’t create something, use something that exists”. Then you need to read better. I am saying you need to ask your questions in a better way to get the answers that both help you and give value to the community. You basically asked "I made something in 100 lines, is that good?"
So what? There’s nothing at all for me no matter what I do? Guess I’ll spend the rest of my life in a dumpster.
I mentioned this in my potential solution. To get a hash from a file, then I will need a separate project because at runtime there are no csharp files in the bin folder as it all gets compiled to dll. So my question was to ask if it's possible to detect a change at runtime within a single project? (it's totally possible with a multi-project where ProjectA can inspect the csharp files in ProjectB and generate a config that ProjectB can use).
To be clear, what I put in my quotation marks are what I call it, not what anyone else calls it. All I've explained it to gets a pretty good understanding of it so it seems to work. Let's then expand your comment, what is it you wish to really say?
I edited.
Now that I can do.
I wonder if you could add the get hash code to the build script and insert those values into some resource files and have some time stamps on them so you have the old and new?
————————————- START TRANSMISSION ————————————- Dear dzkn, I’m sending you this message from my Commodore 64. I can’t reply as fast, as it seems degradation has taken its toll. It’s great to hear from you again. It’s quite comfortable here, but it could be better. The room is a bit damp, and it’s very dark. There’s barely any electricity here, I’m stuck using a generator. Food is pretty scarce, but I’m making it by one day at a time. How are things? How is the world? It’s been a long time, I would love to hear all about your ventures. For now though, I must go. I’ll be awaiting your reply. With best regards, ADumbBrick ——————————— END TRANSMISSION ———————————
&gt; static doesnt imply global. True, rather than implying global it explicitly states the lifetime is global.
Fun fact, the keyword for this in VB is `shared`. (VB also has a `static` keyword, but it means something very different.)
Static classes don't create garbage for GC to clean up. Can be useful for utility classes with no state.
Thanks, So static classes can’t have &gt;1 instance?
Thanks guys!
Make sure that that is really your limitation. Initializing an executable is not generally a big issue, the executable loading it's (language, image..) data might be. In any case, there is https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract which seems to be relatively recent, but also tied to a specific tesseract release version. If that version is a no-go for you, look into if tesseract has some kind of a "batch" mode where it can be fed filenames to process through standard input/output (I'm guessing here, but that would make sense for commandline OCR software).
Nope. And though there is technically one instance of a static class, you (as the dev) don’t instantiate it (you can’t use the *new* keyword with a static class)
It's not the lines of code that matter, it's how you use them.
I read in your post history that it's hand-rolled. Is it possible for you to record when a model or projection is changed and to simply store that _in the database_? You can use reflection to get the IL bytes or the signature and store those in different columns. Then you simply compare the hash then bytes that are stored in the database with each model/projection and update the ones that don't match.
I asked this same question a few months ago... if you need more answers have a look on previously asked questions on my profile.
None. I am just using the C# Console Application.
There are other jobs besides being in IT. In fact, I would just take any job I can if I were you. If you're in the USA the economy is booming, unemployment is as lowest since it was in 1969. Good luck.
One thing you can do is try to find temp work or small projects that individuals need done. Offer to build websites for people or local businesses. Then on your resume, you can list it as freelance work or self employment. This is a fairly easy way to get that first year of professional experience. If you’re really good, this could even grow into its own business. However, for many programmers, it is at least a foot in the door and a decent bullet point for a resume. Also, be aware that your location is a very, very important factor regarding your ability to find work. Some areas just don’t have many programming jobs. Others have a lot of jobs, but also a lot of competition. Some areas will favor one language over another. Maybe C# isn’t in demand where you are right now. Early on in your career, I would recommend trying to develop a broad knowledge base using different languages, and then as you gain experience, start to focus on one language or technological area that you really enjoy. If you lock yourself into one thing too early, you may miss out on good opportunities. Good luck.
Thanks. I think I understood most things on there, but I didn't understand how to apply this to the process you just started with Process.Start(). For example,if I want to do Process.Start("Chrome.exe"), how do I apply this to the Chrome window?
And what, baggage handler? Waiter? Kill me now.
There is no better explanation with examples than the [documentation itself](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static). I recommend you read it completely if you are trying to understand it. The thing that helped me understand the static keyword was the ``Math`` class. To use the ``Math`` class you don't *instantiate* an object of type Math and then use that object to perform Math operations (E.g. ``Math mathObject = new Math(); // Doesn't work``). Instead you simply use whatever function you want from Math (E.g. ``double result = Math.Pow(2,4); // result == 16``). This is because Math itself is a static class, which just means you can create an object of type Math. You can apply this static keyword to functions and properties as well. This has the similar effect where they aren't related to any particular object that has been instantiated. So a property that is labeled static means that property is related to the class type itself, not any particular object that you create from it. So if I have a ``Employee`` class that has the static property ``employeeCounter`` which I increment every time I create a new object, then that count will be stored only once and be related to the *type* ``Employee``. But not any particular Employee object that was created. You can kind of think of it as *every* Employee object shares this same member ``employeeCounter``.
100 loc isn’t much. If performance is really a issue, A good exercice is to estimate time and space complexity of your algorithm. And to benchmark given multiple scenarios. For example how your algorithm behaves if you need to serialize/deserialize let say 10Gb of data.
You're the first person I've ever heard advocating to do more than one language. Everyone else basically says "Pick one and stick with it and don't do anything else until you get hired. " That being said, C# is the one I prefer out the ones I've dabbled in. I apply anywhere and everywhere if it's a job that I feel I am qualified for. However I don't even get a rejection most of the time. How do I approach local businesses about this? Most of the local ones I could google and most likely find at least some sort of web presence, and have been around for years and years before I even thought of programming.
Thanks for the clarification. Performance however is not an issue and I do plan on adding more features to my system for handling large files and pieces of data by multithreading and reading and writing directly to files like you can do with XMLReader.
Could you decorate the classes implementing your views or projections with metadata for the versioning info you need, i.e. custom attributes on the types? That would make it very simple to inspect at runtime. Otherwise it seems like you'd essentially need to get like a stable hash from the runtime definition of a type? If the .cs file is convenient, you'd use that, but it's not so you need an alternate to the file, which would be the compiled, runtime definition of the type that was in the .cs file.. You could maybe get an IL byte array of the type implementation with reflection and use something like SpookyHash or FNV1a or something. Collisions would be pretty dang rare, but could happen.
Souce code in database dynamically injected.
Serialise the object with its type info, store it. Then compare.
I've not too familiar with IL Bytes. Are you referring to this? [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.methodbody.getilasbytearray?view=netframework-4.8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.methodbody.getilasbytearray?view=netframework-4.8) If I've understood this correctly then it contains the unique IL for the method? If so then I'm guessing the IL will stay the same as long the code is the same and unchanged. This could work really well for generating the hash at runtime. I'll play around with this and report back :)
There are two problems with the idea of “pick one and stick with it”: 1) As a newer programmer, how are you supposed to know which language will fit you best if you don’t try out a variety of them? 2) Every job I’ve had for the past 15 years has required using more than 1 language. You might use C# or Java exclusively for the back end, but you still might need to use JavaScript (Angular or React) for the front end. Even in non-web projects you’ll often be using SQL to interact with databases or Python scripts to run various tasks. Plus, you might have to maintain legacy code written in C or Ruby. Having said that, becoming an expert in one language is a good goal. I just think it would be more beneficial if you kept your options open early in your career. If your local businesses have been around for years and years, they may need updates for their websites. Reach out to them asking if they are happy with their current provider. Find out who that provider is and apply there. If they don’t have a website, go in the store and strike up a conversation to ask if they’d be interested in one.
I could add metadata or attribute, but then the knowledge needs to be passed down to all the developers and newcomers using the framework that each time they change the projection/view, they need to upgrade the version. &amp;#x200B; I don't have experience working with IL byte array but I'm looking into this right now, thanks for the suggestion :)
I actually did dabble in other languages, Python, and Java specifically, but it always came back to C#. I also learned the front end languages because my idea is to become a full stack developer. Everything I’ve learned has really centered around web development, though I’d be open to doing mobile or offline software.
Yeah I'm not sure right off hand if you can get all the IL for a type at once, or if you might need to enumerate methods and properties - but you don't have to do anything with the IL itself, just hash it, same as if it was UTF-8 bytes from the .cs file.
Then make a more complicated one til you hit the limits of your math education.
Ok.
I already know I'll be miserable doing either of them, and there isn't much else around here. My goal in learning programming was to give myself a real career, not a job where I can barely support myself, and there's no hope for anything different in the future. If I do that, I'll never get out of here.
Just be realistic. Get any job you can, move up from there.
In the OP, if Count &gt; 1 and CustomName is the empty string, CustomName ends up with the value `string.Format("{0} ({1})", Info.Name, Count)`. In all except your last attempt, if Count &gt; 1 and CustomName is the empty string, CustomName ends up with the value `Info.Name`. That's more than just different code paths, right?
I would generate a hash, then compare the bytes to verify against hash collision. Otherwise, you're looking at some really slow byte comparison. Also, keep in mind that if any dependencies change, that's still going to break. So if you have some service or helper method var result = _service.transformToDifferentModel(someIntermediateValue) Those IL will not change, so you'll be in a lot of trouble if transformToDifferentModel is modified, even though the IL will be the same.
They do have constructors which you can customize, however. And you can use reflection to realize them.
All true. I just didn’t want to over complicate things (poor guys just trying to figure out how and what to use the static keyword for. When he gets some experience with it, he can discover reflection)
looks great - would this be available for VS Code as well?
Previously Asked at [CSharp - Static Meaning](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/9vhv6b/static_meaning/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
Not without reflection, no. What's your issue with the override?
Good question, I need to do some digging but this might or might not be possible. I think it is
If I saw that, I would assume that the first method does nothing but call the second method. If that's not the case, the names are wrong.
It should be since window size and location isn't handled by the application, it's handled by the DWM. So you should be able to start the process, capture the handle, and use P/Invoke to set window properties.
&gt; fun fact &gt; VB trivia no thanks fam! Im good!
Then, use your newly made calculator to get better at that too!
I've been working on a Real Time image/message board like the Chans (think 4chan UI) using ASP MVC and SignalR. however kind of stopped... due to whats the point of having this on my resume if the most mainstream opinion of imageboard like sites is 4chan or 8chan's "bad image" of the detritus of the internet. Or maybe Im too paranoid and overthinking this
I'm unaware of any way to do this directly. If the app supports it, you can send command-line parameters when you start it. If not, you've got the process handle, so you could try using `SendMessage()` to send the appropriate commands to it. Depending on if it has opinions about what happens when it moves/resizes, that might work.
What technology do you use? From the picture it's looks like UWP. But it can be WPF or WinForm. Can you specify?
I'm using WPF. I don't think that is UWP btw but honestly I don't have no clue.
Maybe something like [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html), or it's strategy for integers, and then base64 encoded to stringify the byte array output of MessagePack's serializing the int[].
Ok than i'll put solution for each technology: WPF: &lt;Window ... WindowStyle="None" WindowState="Maximized" WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen"&gt; Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15413263/how-to-make-title-bar-disappear-in-wpf-window UWP: ApplicationViewTitleBar formattableTitleBar = ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView().TitleBar; formattableTitleBar.ButtonBackgroundColor = Colors.Transparent; CoreApplicationViewTitleBar coreTitleBar = CoreApplication.GetCurrentView().TitleBar; coreTitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar = true; Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33440438/how-to-hide-collapse-title-bar-in-a-uwp-app WinForm: this.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.None; Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7482922/remove-the-title-bar-in-windows-forms Hope that'll help.
What do you mean by efficient? Are you trying to reduce a request from 2k to 1k by adding in lots of error prone processing? There's nothing efficient about that. (This smells like premature optimization too.) If you're determined... any way you do this, it's going to cost you processing on both the encoding and decoding side. * Just use some kind of compression. With low compression ratios, it'll still squeeze nicely for larger chains of values and quickly. * Shift to a higher base number representation. Base 16 (hex) will take less space to represent. Base 64 even fewer. * Rethink how and why you have so many claims and whether they can be processed in chunks instead of passed all at once.
Thank you, I'll try later and I'll let you know
That would not be part of the information that you can pass directly to the application. If you take the Process instance that Process.Start() gives back, you can wait until MainWindowHandle is not IntPtr.Zero. Then you can use the SetWindowPos() Win32 API to set the position using the Handle. Depending on how you are using it you may want a timeout (in case the program doesn't create any Windows) and many applications will alter the position of their own Window (for example restoring a saved setting) so if you change the position before it does so, it will simply override it. So you might want to delay even further after the handle itself is created to try to ensure your specified location is the last one assigned. Might also be worth it to verify the Window style to see if it is user-sizable and if not, use the current width and height (GetWindowPos) instead of overriding with your own. This also won't work with UWP Applications. Not because they don't create a Window, but because the Main Window created is not associated with the process, so MainWindowHandle will always be IntPtr.Zero.
Yeah its actually not a performance issue that led us down this route.. we face a limit on the length of HTTP request headers in these edge case scenarios where JWT length is like 6kb (depends on the length of the other headers of course). IIS servers are by default configured with a cap on combined request header length. We of course can widen that configured range, but what happen when we face this in our load balancers, reverse proxies, customer facing proxies, etc. Too many scenarios where the overall length is going to be an issue. Regarding reducing number of claims, we don't see a way to do this either without limiting the granularity the claim system provides. &amp;#x200B; The alternative is to just store our session/claims in an out of process store like Redis, but we don't want to have to pay the tax of talking to Redis on every request. (This is a microservice architecture, so caching in memory is not really an option either since no way to manage the cache in a distributed fashion).
I got my current job, which I started at in 2013, Via "letters of inquiry". Basically I researched and found local software development companies and sent them a resume and cover letter even though they did not have any job listings anywhere. I wasn't contacted until 6 months later when they were looking for a new developer. At the time I had zero professional experience (not counting freelance work). Furthermore, I had no post-secondary education and no degree at all. As it happens, normally, they would ignore applicants without a degree. I ended up in the running for two reasons. The first was that my website and my github projects at the time, the latter of which in their words "Blew them away". The second was possibly that I was a 2012 Microsoft MVP in C# (I think I used one of the employment reference letters available through the program as well, so I got what at least looked like a personalized letter of recommendation from Richard Kaplan). I don't know how that might have factored in or even if they got it though. Anyway, my point is, you don't need to look for openings- the position I have literally never had a job listing anywhere, and if I hadn't sent my stuff in, somebody else that had may have been chosen instead and there never would have been a listing to apply to.
How about you use semantic versioning and just check the assembly version?
This looks great OP! Can I ask why it's now free?
You need to define what you mean by 'length' and 'height'.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4260207/how-do-you-get-the-width-and-height-of-a-multi-dimensional-array
Dimentinal denominational dimensional!
Use reflection to find the classes you care about, insantiate a "dummy" version of each one (default values), serialize them in some way, json or whatnot, and generate the hash from the json
Many source control systems have a way to update tags in a file. Git supports a `$Id$` tag if the file has the ident attribute (see https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes and search for ident). I know you've said you don't want source control solutions, but at runtime you're not dealing with source control itself, but just an identifier it left behind. Hopefully that provides enough separation for your requirements.
Sounds like the other pc has a different version of the database
Yeah I think as he stated above, base64 is probably your best bet. But have you actually tested redis? The tax may not be as high as you think.

Great .. thank you!
Unfortunately this requires a registration for some reason. Thanks but no thanks, I will not be using this.
Why can't you just use version numbers on your dlls and use a proper branching flow etc?
Are you familiar with the way permissions are set and used in database applications in c#, specifically the connection strings and how database authenticates? Authentication with local databases can be confusing. Also, do you have the same database software engine on both computers?
It occurs to me from reading this thread and specifically this post, that you could very much benefit from contributing to an open source project. However, you said something important: there is a challenge in finding one at your level. How about instead of finding one, you start one? It would be at your level, it would be an open source project, and you can recruit others at your level. It doesn't have to be the next great must have app. Just think of something you'd like to be part of designing and making, and go from there. That would count as programming experience. Even more if you are the project manager.
Well, the real challenge, is figuring out how to search GitHub properly. I do search GitHub and find things like .Net Core... Which would be cool to contribute to I don't know enough about programming to help with that. I've asked about... How best to go about searching, and people generally just say... Search. Which is unhelpful.
In my case the project I am testing with compiles and runs but takes way longer than normal to start when recording. Normal launch is less than a second, while recording it takes almost 15 seconds. And I seem to be only able to see about the first 4-8 seconds of that in the playback so I can't see to where I started actually doing anything in the program, doesn't appear to be a limitation caused by the "freeness" but maybe it is so that's disappointing. But what it does let me see is pretty neat so I'm going to play around with it some more in some other projects and see how it goes.
A project that I am currently working on happened quite by accident. Literally, an accident. Someone hit the back of my car in a parking lot, and I end up at a body shop /car dealership. While I was there, I noticed the guy at the counter was having a difficult time with the software he was using. After a while, we were talking and I mentioned how he seemed to not like working on the computer. Turns out, the program he was using to manage the jobs and customers was full of bugs, had not been updated in several years, and was just unpredictable. I asked him what he would prefer in this type of software. He started talking about it, what he would like in a software package like this, and I was trying to remember it as best I could. A couple weeks later I took in a demo program I had built up, paying special attention to the things he had mentioned he would want in a package. I demonstrated it for him, and let him use it and test it. We are now in beta testing for the production release.
Interesting, now I just need to run into someones car :) Kidding.
Dalmational?
This is a good answer. Easy to understand, and clear with a good example. Thank you.
LoL.... Getting experience can be such an aggravation. Most of us have been there. Lots of good advice and these comments.
If the project is fun to you and as long as it isn't promoting anything explicitly, it will do no wrong having it on your resume. SignalR and ASP MVC are very important skills to have in an enterprise, real-time marketplace which is today's job market, and if you can phrase it as a social media/messaging platform, with no reference to chans, it will do more good than any harm possible on your resume. The chans' bad image stems from it's culture, not it's technology. As long as your project isn't associated with any, there is nothing to fear, though if your recruiter happens to be a person of taste, I don't see why would they deduct any praise from your project -- a lot more people visit 4chan/*chans than they would like to admit, I hardly think any future employer would care about your project's inspiration over it's execution.
Very true. It would be difficult to tell someone else what to search for is a coding project. If you don't find one that you feel comfortable getting involved in, well... I say unto thee again, start one :)
I don't mean to sound like I have an attitude, I'm just frustrated, and I do pay attention and attempt to add each new thing I find, and I was really just kidding about hitting someone :).
Any suggestions? My hopes are to work in web dev. I particularly want to be a full stack developer. I enjoy all aspects of programming, even the frustratingly annoying ones.
: ) it's all good, my friend. I did not think you had an attitude at all. I certainly understand about being frustrated with it, I get that way as well. Probably most of us do. Starting out is particularly difficult, as you know. Smart move on not hitting someone, haha.. If you do happen to start an open source project of your own, please make sure to post it so we can get involved. I have never been involved in a widely available open source project, I think it would be excellent experience and very enjoyable.
I really don't have any suggestions about full stack development, I have no experience with it at all. Like you, I enjoy all aspects of programming. I love the logic of it. Even when it is incredibly annoying, it is still extremely relaxing.
I've often wanted to do something like it. Thank you for being understanding :), and trying to help.
Indeed, and then that aha moment you get when you finally figure out the problem. That's one of my favorite parts.

I wonder if it's not ready for VS2019 yet. Then again I assume you can exclude versions of Visual Studio that your extension will install to, so it _should_ be compatible.
Congratulations, you have signed up for VB Fun Facts. \* In September 2009 Carlton &amp; United Breweries released Victoria Bitter (VB) RAW to compete in the low carb market.

Look at you go with your object oriented programming. &amp;#x200B; /cries into his anemic entities
I guess the same holds for games? Some of them only run in Fullscreen mode
I don't do much object oriented programming these days. I try to be more functional instead, having good success so far. Haven't defined inheritance in a very long time, use interfaces when I have IO I need to mock/fake for testing. I create models that disallow invalid variants so the rest of my code operates on already validated data constructs. I believe many code bases can use such principles even if they are usually using anemic models
Just an idea, but maybe don't write a 6.7k lines test file, maybe split those tests by topic in different files?
As others may have mentioned, you can use P/Invoke to do this. You will need to open chrome using process.start, get the main window handle from the object that process.start returns, then use something like GetWindowRect and MoveWindow. Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32260424/resize-other-window-or-application-c-sharp
Probably because Microsoft is developing their own "time-machine" for azure and [asp.net](https://asp.net) =&gt; [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/introducing-time-travel-debugging-for-visual-studio-enterprise-2019/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/introducing-time-travel-debugging-for-visual-studio-enterprise-2019/)
&gt; However, the definition extends further and says that “patterns are formalized best practices”. To qualify for the term “pattern”, an approach is not worthy until someone or some group has proven through some formal process that this approach is superior to all others, and qualifies as “best practice”. I think this is a misunderstanding of the term "formalized" in the definition. It's not about a formal process to prove superiority (as if that were even possible), it's about describing the practice in the typical way of a pattern, like filling out a form: What is it called? What is the problem it intends to solve? What are the trade-offs? What does it look like? Perhaps your experience doesn't match mine, but I haven't seen "anti-pattern" thrown around indiscriminately for anything that doesn't match an existing pattern. I *have* seen it used to describe patterns that someone doesn't like for more or less justifiable reasons. (I have used it myself to describe Singleton.) More importantly, though, I've never seen it used to stifle experimentation, which seems to be the core message of the article.
Build something that you would like to have... If you don't get any ideas, clone the application that you use often.
I'm no expert in WPF or UWP...however in WinForms, your code simply removes the title bar and nothing else. It does not place the system buttons back down like in OP's image, you'll need to re-add them yourself with 3 buttons hooked up to the form events.
Hmm, not sure, but this looks like the standard TCP-Server implementation, no fancy stuff happening here
Does the order of the values matter? Are most of the values in a certain range (e.g. sequential ids), or are they completely random across the entire int32 range? Are there negative numbers?
&gt;do you have the same database software engine on both computers? Yes both machines have ace.oledb.12 &gt;Are you familiar with the way permissions are set and used in database applications in c#, specifically the connection strings and how database authenticates? I did some research on google about the integrated security things and i've found nothing It looks like a permission issue indeed. But ive no clue how to manage it! And both machines runs under administrator permissions.
That what i thought in first. But ive found that what matters is the engine. And both machine uses ace.oledb.12
Since VS2019 is quite new I'd also guess that it's just not properly compatible yet.
Agree. &gt; PSE_5E_P5_69 What god-awful test names. You can tell this was written by a mathematician, not a developer.
Actually i did some research for achieving custom title bar and what i've found is you have to create a custom window class. This tutorial from CodeProject explains everything properly: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/140267/Create-Custom-Windows-in-WPF-with-Ease
C# is the one language to rule them all\*, but not everyone has realised this yet, and there is a lot of code that is already written for other languages that isn't going to be rewritten Another option is to apply for support type roles where the spec talks about transitioning to development. These can be a bit frustrating for aspiring devs, but if you can already code and find some projects to automate some of the support work a decent company isn't going to get in your way and you can get the dev experience without getting hired directly for a dev role. You'll also be around and working with the other devs fixing the more ticking support issues, it won't be too hard to find someone that believes in you and will take the time to mentor you; if there is one thing true of all devs, we respond very positively to someone that is enthusiastic about learning to code &amp;#x200B; \* take with a pinch of salt

Why use something like `Regex`, if `string.Split` is perfectly fine for this? Seems vastly overkill.
Your comment was not even 20 minutes after the other responses. Show some effort, spend some more time on it. Read the documentation. If you're still stuck after a long time, then share what you currently have, explain which parts of the documentation you don't understand.

Hey, Developer license is for free for everyone, no exceptions, forever! We do indeed have an Enterprise Version, also mentioned in EULA targeted for companies that want to improve DevOps Observability. If it comes to VS2019, we support it. If you experience any problem I'll be happy to connect with you to see what's going on and solve the problem.
Sure I can guess, I'm not responsible for his code.
Ok nvm, done it using: Regex r = new Regex(" +"); string\[\] split = r.Split(userinput); Thanks!
Yeah, he should have written a CRUD framework like a real developer. /s
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s. *I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
You really are the worst bot. As user Pelt0n once said: &gt; God shut up *I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
I really like the use of operator overloading to specify the equations. Nice work.
By your post it doesn't seem like you need to separate Fine from FineType. They go along nicely. &amp;#x200B; I also don't understand why you need data duplication. Microservices communicate with each other, together forming a big system / application. Isolation is important, but in the end these services aren't completely isolated, they do have an API.

No negatives, they can be ordered, they are auto increment column values but since the app is multi tenanted they range can be pretty broad, even within the same tenant.
Hey, thanks! Basically, we are focusing on the sales of Enterprise product, targeted to companies and more about DevOps Observability rather than just debugging. Honestly, we made Developer version free for multiple reasons, one is of course exposure. The second is to improve it more and more, and it comes with a lot of people using it. :) The third reason is that we just love to share it, but it sounds so marketing-ish I thought you won't believe me anyway. :P

No.
Remove the workgroup security from the DB. Google "remove oledb permissions" and that should fix it.
In WPF, you're best off using something like [WindowChrome](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.shell.windowchrome?view=netframework-4.8). That way, you can remove the title bar and still have some of its buttons like close. Possibly also something more full-featured like [FlatWindow](https://github.com/Manuel-S/FlatWindow).
[RevDeBug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RevDeBug.RecordReplayforNET-RevDeBug). It's free and contains historical debugging from VS Enterprise + OzzCode tools. They have some premium version, but free is also very functional.

I'll allow this. It's not like the user is spamming their product left, right, and centre and a one-off announcing free availability of a normally paid product I think is ok. There's also no subterfuge (there's no disguises or deception trying to pass it off as a blog entry) and not trying to sell licenses here. If OP posts more articles exuding the product, they would probably be removed. But this one off announcement, especially in light of the general post history of the account, is enough to let it slide. The rule is more about preventing more overt acts of selling products, disguising advertisements/paid promotions, or users accounts whose sole purpose is plugging a product or service.

In the context of this thread, it's actually a very helpful fact... Because the keyword "shared" in VB conveys much better what "static" actually means. C# inherited the "static" keyword from C++, which inherited it from C... Where it basically meant something similar (one shared instance of a variable), but the name "static" made more sense (since the value of the variable would retain the last value across multiple calls, as opposed to local/automatic/stack variables).
Thank you so much. We are not trying to advertise paid products,we do mention them when asked about EULA, I hope that's ok, but it's targeted to companies anyway, and I don't see company accounts here :P We also don't want to be perceived as spammers. :)
I'm not facing any issue rn. Every time I call one of the methods, like this: ``` double[] values = new double[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; Normalize(values); ``` I'm not sure which method is being invoked. Only when I ran the code in VS with a breakpoint on the method call line, I find out that the first method (the one without the named params) is being invoked.
You should also make your SendDataAsync method async, like this: public async Task SendDataAsync(string command) { var socketAsyncEventArgs = new SocketAsyncEventArgs(); var buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(command); socketAsyncEventArgs.SetBuffer(buffer, 0, buffer.Length); await _tcp.Client.SendAsync(socketAsyncEventArgs); } Calling an async method without awaiting the task may work sometimes, but the behaviour can be unpredictable and you should avoid doing this.
&gt; C# is the one I prefer out the ones I've dabbled in. Two things wrong with this: 1) C# is used by big enterprisy companies. The types that are LEAST likely to higher a novice. 2) You said "dabbled". If you're trying to get a job and "dabbled" is your skill level you're going to hava hard time.
Well how else do you figure out what you like? Security I have coded almost exclusively for four years. I guess in your eyes I should have chosen another language that I don’t like working with like PHP and get stuck working with that the rest of my career
Sure, it's multi-threaded, but the approach here is really bad. You're blocking so many threads...one per client plus one for accepting a client. A much better approach would be to rework this code to be asynchronous.
Wiping out the migrations should not matter. Are you perhaps using hard-coded IDs somewhere? If so, then that's your issue. Otherwise I don't see the problem. But to answer your question: there is no other way than the Up-method, because the current ID is an implementation detail of the database.
What support roles would you look for? This is something I've considered, but don't even know the best kind of jobs to look for. QA? Or something else?
I certainly will. I want something that is more than "Write hello world in your native language. " And less than .Net Core, which... I don't think they're open to letting just anyone work on. This is basically what I've found trying on my own to find open source stuff.
Thank you for the tip! I thought that I don't need to await sending but only receiving data
QA if the emphasis is on writing unit tests and debugging when you find an issue, otherwise you wouldn’t be looking at code. For support I’m more think about App Support / Tier 2 support for internal line of business apps (not desktop support) where you have at least read access to code

Interestingly, I think it's just referring to the Physics for Scientists &amp; Engineers 5th Edition textbook, part 5 figure 69. I'd guess they use the worksheets from the book as their unit tests. In that case, the name makes some sense. I wonder if the tests are auto generated or a standard set of tests in the math programmer community? I also wonder about the copyright concerns.
Whenever you use an Async method (SendAsync etc) your calling method should be async, and that method of it's being invoked by another, should have await on it.
Good to know, and what if I want to have it it MainWindow() method which cannot be async?
