Is there a business requirement for CopyTo to throw a NotImplementedException or otherwise undermine an interface "contract"? If not, then why do it?
Not sure if this is the problem, but I think you only need curly-braces around ENTER and BACKSPACE, not the regular letters.
Enums aren't just syntactic sugar in C#. They are however in Java. edit: just a fun fact for those not acquainted with Java: generics are also little more than syntactic sugar in the Java compiler.
I very well understand that my sentiment is probably not favorable because by definition forums are academic, as you said. However if most of these guys are programmers by trade, I am more than certain that they know that most of their colleagues are average joes, not academics. You can be a very successful software developer without knowing the GOF patterns by heart, or being always spot on with making the decision of "favor composition over inheritance", or returning an IList vs IEnumerable. I've worked with some brilliant academic minds in the past that had no grasp of the business domain. They were not nearly as valuable to the operation as a whole as those that perhaps weren't as academic, but knew the business inside and out. Again I am not here to argue, I am obviously going against the grain here.
&gt;They are however in Java. [EnumSet, OTOH](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/EnumSet.html)
Do like michaelquinian says. Even though you're calling dispose on it, you're doing it inside a couple of if statements, and there's no guarantee that Dispose will get executed if program flow doesn't make it down in there. However, with the using{} block, you are. 
Alright. But people typically talk about programming because they want to discuss how it can be done better. This thread was started by someone actively soliciting advice on an abstract topic. If you aren't interested in that discussion, why participate?
Thanks, will update my code. Much appreciated for the help! Will see if I can reproduce with the change
I would strongly suggest that you avoid Sendkeys wherever possible. You would be better off looking into the Windows API. However, considering what you are dealing with, this might not be possible.
I've rewritten it as a console application. The full source is here: http://pastebin.com/wr9t339g Still not working right, but it should be a lot easier to read and edit now.
I do a lot of work with Windows process interoperability. What you are trying to do is kind of tedious. Your first problem is that sendkeys is targeting the main process of the emulator. The main form of that process has a different window handle than the actual game play screen. That's why your file open commands are working. You'll need to get the window handle to the game screen and either use sendkeys with that handle or you will need to use p/invoke with SendMesage. To get the handle you'll need to iterate over all the child forms of the main process. To learn how the child forms are structured you'll need to use Spy++. It should be included with Visual Studio. I'm away from my dev machine with sample code but I think this should be enough for you to Google about. If you need some examples let me know and I can get them to you in a few days.
That does make sense as to why it's not working. Unfortunately Spy++ is not included with the Express version of Visual Studio so I'm unable to access that tool. I'll keep at it and report back later if I need more help or not with getting this to work. Thanks though! -Edit- Every test I've tried to get the child handle refuses to work. WinSpy doesn't even show me that there are any children for VBA, though it does in other programs (if I load the calculator I can see every button, just as an example). So now I'm just confused. :\
changed it up. if I run it twice, it still throws the memory leak. Since this program won't be ran twice as it will be called then the node rebooted, gonna move on. I isolated it down to the serverManager.CommitChanges(); which is the mwa api. I have found and reported other bugs to their api, so I am not shocked. edit: I also changed my code to actually not use the mwa api and instead read the xml and update there. I do not get the memory leak. Thanks for your help

I actually did a just little bit of that in C++ long time ago (malware related, so not very proud of it), but then i switched to C# to develop GUI apps (i hated winapi, Qt etc) and game devel with a friend (either C# Unity or C# Xamarin for android). I'm still a bit newbie but i learn very quickly. But everytime i read about your topic... I can't help it, i must read about it and try to do some stuff, keeps me motivated. So thanks :)
Okay, there are two problems here. Let's take this line of code, that shows both. SendKeys.SendWait("Z"); First off, the minor problem. This doesn't mean press the key labeled "Z". It means (for most keyboard layouts), press the "Shift" key, then press the "Z" key, then release the "Z" key, then release the "Shift" key. Obviously changing it to SendWait("z") gets rid of the shift key noise, but that's ignoring the bigger issue. Those four, or two, steps happen as quickly as the lower level API, SendInput, can make them occur. This is apparently faster than it takes for whatever game is being emulated to register as a key press. You can work around that, but it's not easy. Take this [bit of code](http://pastebin.com/EwgdJVP1). It uses keybd_event to break apart the two steps (press the key, then release it), which allows it to define a delay between them. In this case, a delay of a quarter of a second works to move the character a small about in an emulated game for me. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to hook up the SetForegroundWindow() code you have now to this approach, I'm just using a 5 second sleep to give me enough time to move the focus manually here. I'd also recommend reading up on how to properly use SendInput. keybd_event is a deprecated API, I just happen to have some sample code laying around that uses it.
What topic are you referring to? This one? I don't know how you could find this thread motivational, but glad I could help lol.
You could try using [TestStack](https://github.com/TestStack/White) or go directly to Microsoft's [UI automation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx). Failing that, you could always just drive the keyboard and mouse by using SendKeys and such.
Thanks, I'll look into those and see what I can make sense of
Where's the Sip(); method?
Look into Selenium, it can help automate browsers (mainly for testing purposes..)
My wife's store uses a DBF based database for her point of sale. I wrote her a extract program to populate her online database. What I learned is that you have to use ODBC to connect to your .dbf then you just call the name of your dbf in your sql (select * from CUSTOMER where custid=?). My repo is private because we have some sensitive password stuff for our web services and such but I will share with you my base odbc abstract class. using System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Data; using System.Data.Odbc; namespace TaylorCollection.Data { public abstract class BaseODBCRepository&lt;T&gt; { private readonly string _connectionString; protected BaseODBCRepository(string connectionString) { _connectionString = connectionString; } public string ConnectionString { get { return _connectionString; } } public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Select(string sql, Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; parameterMap, Func&lt;IDataReader, T&gt; resultMapper) { var items = new List&lt;T&gt;(); using (var conn = new OdbcConnection()) using (var cmd = new OdbcCommand()) { cmd.CommandText = sql; foreach (var p in parameterMap) cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(p.Key, p.Value); cmd.Connection = conn; conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString; conn.Open(); using (var reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()) { while (reader.Read()) items.Add(resultMapper(reader)); } } return items; } public int NonQuery(string sql, Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; parameterMap) { using (var conn = new OdbcConnection()) using (var cmd = new OdbcCommand()) { cmd.CommandText = sql; foreach (var p in parameterMap) cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(p.Key, p.Value); cmd.Connection = conn; conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString; conn.Open(); //For UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements, the return value is the //number of rows affected by the command.

I've heard good things about selenium, but I have had good luck with Sikuli (Jython based)
I agree. I used White Automation for a over year at work and it was a very convenient wrapper for the Microsoft UI automation framework
If you just want to automate existing software, and don't have knowledge of its inner workings and / or it doesn't expose an API (so you just want to emulate human interaction) I'd recommend either Selenium or AutoIt. Can you accomplish the same in C#? Of course. Will it require more effort for similar effect? In this case, possibly. Even as a proficient C# programmer, I wouldn't use it for automation in every situation.
I think the only thing you need to do is to get all the html tags and to remove them. (Everything included in the body of your html page and included in "&lt;" and "&gt;" chars has to be excluded.) Bye PS: Sorry for my bad english. 
[Html Agility Pack](http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) is capable of doing something similar. You can read the html into it, and query it with xpath. Should allow you to filter out the html nodes, and convert it to "plain text"
Trying using the WebBrowser control/class and selecting and copying the text via code.
thnx for your reaction I will check them out :)
It's really not that easy. What if there's a '&lt;' in the text? Don't try to handle HTML vor XML or something like that with regular expressions or similar methods.
I think the '&lt;' in the text will be something like that: '&amp;lt;' But you can find better solution int this thread. 
If you have any say in how the datafile is structured, you could make it a lot easier on yourself to parse it by separating the data sections with a distinct delimiter.
Thanks
This is what I figured was the case, but thought it'd be a fun challenge to do it in C#, however it seems it might be a bit too big of a step for someone who hasn't really done much in C#, so I will try the other routes such as Selenium first and maybe come back to it through C# somewhere in the future, possibly taking a closer look at the white framework as was suggested. I used to mess about with AutoIt nearly 10 years ago if I recall correctly, just sort of having fun and sending friends little prank apps or whatever. Don't remember anything about it though and will need to look into it. A big thanks for the replies everyone, I got some directions from more experienced people regarding what to look into and that's what I asked for. If anyone has any more suggestions however, I'm still all ears. Cheers!
In VS, usually the unit tests are set up as a separate project side by side with the project under test. You can create a unit test project with the new project wizard. You then open up the unit tests in the "test explorer" window. Be aware that the test features of VS are only available in certain editions, I think Premium or Ultimate.
This looks like it could be pretty useful can't wait to check this out tomorrow.
ReSharper has excellent unit test integration so make sure to take advantage of it. If you're not using ReSharper, then start immediately :)
I'll be sure to look into it. Wish it was freeware though :)
As a professional developer, you will increase your value (and therefore salary) by the license fee many times over. Buy it NOW, and never look back.
Wellp, fuckit. Porting my Github code base from java to C# now.

Why is System.Time not good enough? Is it because the precision isn't high enough? Because if so, then by the time your network request comes back, that will be out of date and all that added precision will be wasted. Considering most phones/computers automatically sync their clocks with some server, the client's time will usually give you the correct time, to within a second or two anyhow. Considering you're making a network request, that's pretty much all you can rely on.
I managed to get a primitive and not very foolproof, yet working solution running at work in half an hour and that's awesome, I can automate the mindless printing process, which should be automated in the first place. This was thanks to AutoIt and a tip from another redditor who said that I can just record the action and adjust/move on from there, which turned out to be super easy. Once I've got a better hang of C# I'll try to write one myself, just for the sake of learning about it, but for now I've got a working version pretty much ready, I'll just have to look for ways to make it a bit more clever.
If you are developing on windows, for windows, Visual Studio is the de facto IDE. I am current using xamarin studio for android development (on windows)
I would use http://www.nunit.org/ it's free
I'd really need to compare the results with googling and landing on stackoverflow. There's no definite way to do most of the things, and sometimes insight of other people is very helpful.
My product is not supported (Visual Studio 2012 Premium and Pro). Edit: wow - downvoted for a statement of fact. Stay classy, Reddit.
In the Visual Studio Gallery it clearly lists VS2013 as the only supported version.
Your button still uses an event to raise the ViewModel's RefreshLog method (I suppose, that code was not available). The reason that the code is not available is probably the same as the reason you don't really want to use events: it's not the best way to do stuff (you might argue that it only does the call to the viewmodel method, and nothing else and I'll argue that it will only be a matter of time). Look into the command binding, that will decouple your view from your viewmodel even more. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16314828/bind-command-in-wpf-using-mvvm The solution proposed there is not the best, but it will get you started.
Why do they have a mutex in the storage class? It's not going to protect them from changes made by a user on a different machine. 
Doesn't matter. Buy it. It'll take you 2-3 weeks to get used to the new shortcut keys, (Ctrl-R, M to extract a method from a block of code). 
 I would agree, I do love xamarin studio though
Yeah, that's the biggest problem with this. There's multiple ways to do something and the comments are very helpful.
You could use network time if you can access NTP: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1193955/how-to-query-an-ntp-server-using-c Here are some servers: http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/north-america
I installed this and it's causing problems. When intellisence ttys to come up it says "Loading the projects is required to complete the requested action...Loading project 1 of 1:" and becomes non-responsive. How do I uninstall this?
The unfortunate truth is that there are a lot of code examples that should NOT be followed and people blindly copy-pasta. I'd hate to have those bad eggs delivered directly to VS without any commentary.
Definitely. Heck, talk to a ASP.NET MVC team. You can be the guy that deals only with SQL, EF/nHibernate, and some business logic. Half of the battle with an MVC project is in the 'backend,' if not more. Learn some basic MVC routing, some EF (really easy to pick up), and advertise yourself this way and you can easily pick up a good job. MVC does a great job separating backend from front-end. There are days as an MVC developer that I barely open a browser. Heck, I haven't LOOKED at JavaScript today!
Financial companies and banks are often looking for .NET developers for back end systems. You can find a larger company that works on web sites and have a role that is primarily on the back end. You don't have to be a graphic designer to be a good web developer. But the writing is on the wall in terms of the world moving to the web and open standards. The majority of applications will involve the web in some way and you would do well not get left behind. **If you're unwilling to learn "malarkey" you may find yourself scraping by instead of being in demand.**
I get this concept. I do. That is why I moved jobs in the first place to get web experience. I am not saying that I do not want to be involved with the web, just that I prefer the back end work to the artsy fartsy making things look pretty on the users screen that's all. Basically what I was asking really was are there any jobs out there that I can just do SQL Server and C# as opposed to having to deal with all the frills on top as well which I'm not really interested in. It just seems for me as a web developer looking for a job and looking at the requirements in the job descriptions, it's OK to not have a clue about the data side of things e.g. SQL Server and data access layers, just as long as you show on your CV that you are good at the front end aesthetics. It just seems a shame that while I have such a strong skill set when it comes to handling data and writing good code to deal with this, it looks like I am unemployable because I don't have good Javascript and CSS skills among other things.
Very useful to know about, thanks. I'm just about to start a project that consumes JSON through a RESTful API.
Adderall
Also, 99% of the jobs that are for SQL/C# have javascript/css/blah down as "requirements" to allow HR to weed out otherwise-qualified applicants (cutting out a bad applicant pre-hire is valuable). This has the side-effect of preventing mostly-qualified-but-timid applicants from applying as well (cutting down resume pile to go thru is valuable). You should probably just apply, as you are likely qualified. Usually if you can do "the hard stuff" well, they don't care about "the easy stuff" (as they can pay less for someone less talented to do that stuff). 
100% agree with this. I am "Web Application Developer" but I hardly ever look at HTML let alone CSS/JS. Most of my time is spent in SQL or C# and occasionally I'll stare at some JSON. If you want to get into the web world I would study deep into the workings of HTTP. Know how to craft an HTTP request by hand with custom headers (including cookies). Know the inside and outs of IIS. That will make you far more valuable than knowing any quantity of CSS/JS.
Yeah, look at fintech companies and large funds, e.g. hedgefunds. Many funds in Boston area have tons of reqs for .net / winforms for instance.
Youre gold
&gt; If your classes are just there to hold data, you can deserialize the JSON into a dynamic. That would save you creating any new classes. Can you explain this further?
Here is something online to use as well. http://json2csharp.com/
Are you familiar with the type dynamic? Here is the MSDN article on it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264736.aspx The short of it is: dynamics are treated as an Object at compile time, but it is assumed to support any operation. The effect of this is that many compile-time errors (such as non existant methods) will be pushed off as run-time errors. It basically lets you do dynamically typed style programming in the statically typed environment of C#. Here is a gist that uses JSON.NET and the dynamic type to do some stuff with the JSON data in C# code, without creating any classes to model it: https://gist.github.com/epixhints/7b207c50a08fa48a68b7 This falls apart if you want to add methods onto the individual classes outlined in the article above, in which case the article is a great starting point for consuming JSON data.
I agree, that's why I linked to it in the blog post :)
If you want to add methods, look at inheriting from DynamicObject
If you find a mid to small size company that is looking for a DBA, they would probably consider the fact that you can code a huge bonus. Most places are too small to have true delineated positions. Heck our current DBA is one of the best developers that I've ever worked with. Just something to keep in mind when you see the DBA job postings.
In the design view, remove the event handler from the TextChanged event. Then simply delete the code.
This is probably your best course of action for employment options if you truly want absolutely *nothing* to do with the web. Otherwise you will be largely restricted to companies with large enough teams that you can get away with that attitude. And even then you'd need to be careful because even large companies often have small teams for their specialized groups.
There's a big performance hit in my understanding though. If you're going to use a lot of these objects, it's better to preallocate the memory for them.
Where can I find the event handler?
MVC really is the way to go. They'll have to drag me kicking and screaming back to WebForms. But if the company likes single page apps, there will be a significant portion of JavaScript to write. Fortunately View Model libraries like Knockout are making this easier, more succinct, and more readable all the time. But that's if you can learn the newer techniques of web development and deal with "fancy front end malarkey". JavaScript and HTML are just like any other language in that if you're writing a lot of of it, you're probably doing it wrong. If there are string literals with tags in your C# or JavaScript, you're doing it wrong. There are tools for that. This is not 2004. Stop. If you have ginormous chains of nested functions in JavaScript, guess what you're probably doing: Something wrong.
In the properties window.
This is the correct answer. For reasonably accurate time stamps that most importantly aren't influenced by changes to system time, use SNTP to a public pool.
How helpful...
Hoodoo voodoo. 
Yes, but I would like to point out that current rates for someone who is a javascript expert that also knows a framework like AngularJS in the Austin area (we're talking expert level knowledge here...) is about $120/hr. Still not interested? 
I think using dynamic for this is not a great idea. The generated classes would act as a contract (with dynamic your code will) and it enables IntelliSense. You don't save much time by using dynamic but may decrease maintainability. edit: generic should be dynamic
Why 2010? The newest version is Visual Studio 2013.
Would be more nice to use PascalCase for the C# classes, but add the camelCase property names in the JsonProperty-attribute.
If the classes are just holding data, then I don't understand the benefit of using `dynamic` instead of just `object`... class Program { static readonly JavaScriptSerializer _jsSerializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(); static void Main(string[] args) { var anons = new[] { new {typeId = "-1", input = "text"}, new {typeId = "-2", input = "text2"} }; string strJSON = _jsSerializer.Serialize(anons); Console.WriteLine(strJSON); object[] things = _jsSerializer.Deserialize&lt;object[]&gt;(strJSON); foreach (object o in things) { Console.WriteLine(o); var kvPairs = (Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)o; foreach (var pair in kvPairs) { Console.WriteLine(pair); } } Console.WriteLine(things); } } EDIT: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Web.Script.Serialization;
And for the armor slots you could use an enum. So for example ArmorPieces.Boots, ArmorPieces.Chestplate, etc. :)
Point me to a job listing with a $1.35M/year salary, and I'll move tomorrow.
Cup of coffee and fast paced music... it also helps if you have or know you will have to work on projects where the knowledge you are gaining will be applicable. Imagine as you read how you will apply your knowledge, reading just to read will bore you. 
This is true I have knowledge in all the areas above but I am not awesome at graphic design, I can do a respectable design but not for an 'eye popping, jaw gaping, wow this is awesome' design. So I just get my boss to farm that out while I develop the app or web app functionality and db. Projects get done faster that way too.
I'm very new to the .NET environment. I tried calling Microsoft Sales for some help understanding the different product lines in the .NET branch. But got nowhere, hence this thread. Here's my background. I've been developing and programming in MS Access for 20+ years. Many of my client's databases sit on top of SQL or mySQL depending on their in-house IT's use of SQL tables. But my experience in SQL is strictly related to: * Building/managing table structure for an MS Access Frontend * Integrating my client's data with a proprietary system (so setting up import/export procedures) * Writing Views to be used for integration with proprietary systems, or websites That's a limited background when it comes to analyzing C# Express, Visual Studio, etc... **So... I take it Visual Studio is the next level "UP" from C#????** **Does Visual Studio have complex report writing capabilities?** **What are some major differences between C# and Visual Studio?** **Can I still write C# in Visual Studio?** Those are just some starting questions .... Thanks for your help - Pavilion 
There are a few different choices available. As pointed out already, there's some built in reporting (ReportViewControl), but in my very limited use it really didn't do most of what I needed. It's been a number of years so it could well have changed. IIRC Crystal Reports is included in some versions of VS, but I'm not sure on licensing or distribution, or available feature set. There are also a ton of third party solutions available. Active Reports, and XtraReports are two that I have the most experience with, and both do a great job and have a huge feature set, but may be beyond your budget. 
But London rent. . .
The way I see it (and I am by no means an ASP developer) your file download would be blocking your thread. So only after the download has completed, will the thread be able to update the page. You could try moving it to a backgroundworker thread (google background worker for examples), but I wouldn't know if this is something that you would do in an ASP environment. Also, consider using the "using" directive instead of disposing. using (var connection = new SqlConnection("connectionString")) { connection.Open(); using (var command = connection.CreateCommand()) { ... } }
&gt;There is a Reporting application template (perhaps not available in Visual C# Express), but I think it just uses ReportViewControl &gt; &gt;Here is a walkthrough: &gt; &gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252073.aspx Ok - there is basic (and at this point that's about all that can be said categorically) report writing capabilities in VS. So ... Because VS is nothing like Access I need to understand other issues as well. Let's say my clients put Visual Studio on their server or on a machine dedicated to development. Then we go to deploy to end users. How does that process work? What will be required on all client machines and what is the cost involved. _____________________ There is a real part of me wondering why I should advocate for moving to VIsual Studio, I've several clients that are tired of paying for licenses on every machine using Access. And frankly I don't blame them, it wouldn't be so bad but Microsoft doesn't make it affordable on tight budgets. We've tried creating runtime versions, but the databases are pretty complex and don't do well with that solution - all kinds of errors popup. So ... if we can deploy VS applications on multiple machines without extensive costs, that is a plus. But.... I'm still wondering what we're going to give up in the way of report writing capabilities (sigh). Thanks for all your responses - it really does help me get a big picture point of view. Pavilion
Use a placeholder for this. See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.placeholder(v=vs.110).aspx EDIT: You could also just put a label or literal with runat = server and change the text of said label. And make it visible= true if you need to show it. EDIT2: &gt; I can only think that initiating the file download is stopping the page from refreshing somehow? (total guess) You do a response.transmitfile . See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/12s31dhy(v=vs.110).aspx It states that "Writes the specified file directly to an HTTP response output stream, without buffering it in memory.". So instead of responding with said page it responds with the download. So my guess is that your page won't respond back but just the download. Maybe send the download via pop-up and try that? If the contentplaceholder doesn't fix it that is.
Placeholders with literal controls are great for writing scripts to the page.
I always tend to use the script manager if I need to "Inject javascript" from the page. But usually don't need to. EDIT: Or are you refering to someone malicious injecting javascript to a page?
No, but in a project I have at the moment, I need to insert js and css files, html layouts and google analytics code etc on to a single page. These file references and html designs vary depending upon who has logged in. So I pretty much just use placeholders and lit controls. I'll have a look at script manager though, thanks.
I don't know if its still used a lot. I remembered using it several times. Tho this is in old ASP.net webforms. Nowadays I would just use a MVC project and use a partial or something like that. Or just bundle the JS and CSS and just import the bundle.
Yea, any new project I do i'll make it a resftul service or mvc4 or what not to move away from webforms etc. I remade one of our largest sites into MVC4 and it went successfully if not without a steep learning curve but I'm enjoy developing in both now. Though going back to older code makes me cringe I want to upgrade everything but... needs before wants. 
Aye. ASP.net webforms is terrible, the viewstate etc. MVC is way cleaner. WAY CLEANERRRRR
Just realized I'm an idiot I misread $120 per hour as per day. My bad everybody! (bows head in shame and walks away slowly).... 
I doubt there would be much of a performance hit, but feel free to benchmark it. A concrete object is being returned from the deserialize call -- a JObject I believe. I would hazard a guess that most of the time spent in deserializing is the parsing, not the malloc.
If you want a strong contract, I would recommend generating classes from the actual contract -- the WADL -- no the JSON returned from an API call.
The way that he has it coded now will result in a memory leak in the event of an error with the connection or command. 
Well, I got it working using the edit article above Pretty happy with this, let me know if anyone has questions!
Actual code should never be used in place of comments or documentation. Creating a class is the maintenance headache. If the JSON provider doesn't maintain backwards compatibility both dynamic and your class will blow up. With the exception that I have a single point of code to fix while you have multiple. There is negative maintainability in generating more code for no reason. json["feeds"][0]["title"] is what I prefer writing and looking at. 
You're right. That works. I think x % 2 == 0 is more clear because it doesn't depend on understanding bits, but it'll do the same thing. My only concern might be some unexpected behavior with the bit magic depending on the datatypes involved. I can't think of a counterexample, but I'm guessing there is one. 
You can almost always find where the error is by double-clicking the error in the error window of VS.
Right click the method definition and there should be an option to create a unit test. Go from there.
That's what my professor taught us, but it wasn't working for me. Maybe because it was a web application?
Exactly. When you have magic, who needs a server?
WPF? WinForms? ASPX? What technology are you using?
Have a browse around here: http://www.nuget.org/ 
Handle the textbox one key down event. Check that the key is the return key and then do your stuff. Not on my computer right now, let me know if you need more explanation. 
Do something like "while leftMouse is down) { /*your stuff */} to determine if it's down you can either use a boolean that is set on mouse down and mouse up, or something like mouseButton.isDown (there should be some property like that). 
I am using the following code now: if(Control.MouseButtons == MouseButtons.Left) { // mouse_event stuff }; And it is working better now. However, sometime the event gets fired, even though the left mouse button is not pressed down. It seems like Control.MouseButtons gets "sticky". Is there any way around this? // EDIT: It sometimes happens if I press the ESC-key.
This is not a good answer (to a bad question), because there is a lot of CRAP on NuGet.
&gt; Actual code should never be used in place of comments or documentation. Yes it should. Comments and documentation clarify and add to the code. It is not a substitute for sane code. &gt; [...] If the JSON provider doesn't maintain backwards compatibility both dynamic [...]. This is clearly wrong. Using dynamic dispatch on a JSON result is equivalent of a hard coded dictionary lookup json["feeds"][0]["title"] is equivelent to json.feeds[0].title if json is returned as a dynamic dispatch dictionary. It's just expressed differently. &gt; Creating a class is the maintenance headache [...] There is negative maintainability in generating more code for no reason. No there is not. These classes help when you for some reason need to expand on the service since you already know all the fields returned from service end point. Also /u/work_is_satire mentioned that you should generate classes from the actual contract which I totally agree on. &gt; If the JSON provider doesn't maintain backwards compatibility both dynamic and your class will blow up So what? Manual dictionary lookup will blow up as well, but you have no idea where or when. The advantage of the generated class is that if the service provider has a regression, the code will blow up immediately, and it will blow up in your test environment before it reaches production unless your service provider prefers the Renegade Cowboy™ deployment method. edit: I would like to add that generated code can also have XML documentation which dynamic or manual dictionary lookup cannot.
I've been finding good uses for: * [NodaTime](http://nodatime.org/) to have a uniform time representation that even works across Java/C# - Port of JodaTime. * [protobuf-net](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/), a protocol buffer implementation for serialization of data based on the google specification. Damn fast and useful. * [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json) because you just can't live without json nowadays, works with nodatime when you get the extension: "Install-Package NodaTime.Serialization.JsonNet" . * [Ionic.Zip](http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/) for all the zipping and compression. * [EntityFramework](https://entityframework.codeplex.com/) for object relational mapping. * [ODP.Net](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/index-085163.html) The drivers to access oracle database with C# calls, they are annoying to use since they always have version troubles, bit-ness troubles 32/64, but when they work. They work. Not directly a C# project, but a good old callable DLL [CoinMP](http://www.coin-or.org/projects/CoinMP.xml) from [Coin-OR](http://www.coin-or.org/projects/) for libraries to call for linear programming and mixed integer programming solvers. There is a [c# warpper](http://astarte.csr.unibo.it/coinORwrapper/coinORwrapper.htm) but I haven't tried it yet. 
There's a lot of crap everywhere, as Sturgeon's Law tells us. At least on NuGet it comes with popularity metrics.
Well obviously any list will have to include [ScoreVille](https://github.com/Billytrunks/ScoreVille). I know it's not a library but Billytrunks really poured is heart and soul into it... Also I just discovered that if you type weird things like "tentacle porn" into Github, you get a surprising number of results. Kind of a disturbing number of results actually. In all seriousness though, [NuGet Must Haves](http://nugetmusthaves.com/) is out there. Basically just does a slightly better job than the NuGet stats when it comes to telling how popular something is. Doesn't deal with quality though (other than votes, but I tend to find that sort of metric is usually worthless). But if you want any sort of decent list, you're going to need to tell us what you're looking for.
Thanks for the response! So I can place this after I read the file and then use streamwriter after this to write it to the other text file?
At the time of this post, I'm getting "Service Unavailable We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later."
Sure, read the contents of a text file, store it in a string variable All this function does is, find the "start" string in the string fileContents variable. Ascertains the integer position of the s in "start" and the position of e in 'end'. Then using those two identifying points in the string, it gets all the characters between those two points. You would probably want to put in a few logic checks in there, depending upon the contents of your file. For example, what if the word 'end' appears before the word 'start' or if the word 'end' is part of the inner text between these two points... examine your text and then code to make sure the endPosition integer is &gt; than your startPoition integer at least, etc. We are getting the LastIndexOf end so it should be fine. But double checking to make sure never got me fired :) 
Awesome! Thanks a ton!

What exactly is your class under test? All I see is a mocked interface setup to return some object when LiesBenutzer is called. 
Haha thanks for that. I've been trying my weak google-fu for about 3 hours and I'm no closer to implementing this API in a windows 8 app. 
System.Data is ADO.NET which is not supported in Windows Store applications, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh454070.aspx has a full list of standard .Net namespaces that may be used in Windows Store applications.
I deleted everything that the test should to to determine the error (datenbankM.Object). What the test should do is verify that events where fired and database methods invoked. However, I found the error. The target of the projcets was .NET 4.5, once I changed it to .NET 4 and reinstalled Moq, everything worked fine. Even tho the NuGet Package of Moq contained a 4.5 library
Had time to work out a full solution: private void Form1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { timer1.Start(); } } private void Form1_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if(e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { timer1.Stop(); } } private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { //fireMouseClick //memoEdit1.Text += "click "; } } Should do exactly what you want, and you can modify the timer to tick faster or slower as your heart desires.
private void textBox1_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if(e.KeyValue == (int)Keys.Enter) { } } In case your question has not been answered, here's what I meant
**Thanks!**
Well, what he has is just going to get the part you said you've already done with a regex, I'd use substring to get it instead of a regex, to write the file you need to do something like this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bh11f1k.aspx 
Write the contents of the exception to a log file so you can see what it says. Also, if you're hitting the unhandled exception handler, you're missing a try..catch in your Main method. Where it logs any exceptions that show up. 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y7f5zaaa.aspx That ought to help you. That way when the exception is thrown on the device you'll have your debugger attached to it.
If they aren't using it when I start in March, I'll be sure to let them know about it after a week or two of settling in.
So I guess that Bing has depreciated their REST API but I did find [this](http://gavinmhackeling.com/blog/2012/05/using-the-bing-search-api-in-python/) blog post showing how to query Bing using a get http request
Thanks that helped me out. Appreciate it. 
ServiceStack's license model for business is a little annoying 600 per developer on nuget packages that are easily downloaded. Very easy to break the license by accident and get yourself in trouble. 
Kind of like Splunk?
The hotkey should be triggered system-wide because the application will be running in the background while another window the focus.
What about the code that displays the images? What about the rest of it?
Neat. My brother's having a problem with this, so I think I'll have him give this a shot. Thanks!
 var employeeprofile = db.EmployeeProfile .Include(e =&gt; e.IntermediateRater) .Where(e =&gt; e.OrganizationId == "Some Id"); //Not sure of datatype for OrganizationId... If you want to join it with an organization table: var employeprofile = db.EmployeeProfile .Include( e=&gt; e.IntermediateRater) .Join(db.Organizations, o =&gt; o.OrganizationId, i =&gt; i.Id, (o, i) =&gt; new { EmployeeProfile = o, Organization = i}) This above is the same as this SQL: SELECT o.*, i.* --Feel free to rename the o, i aliases. FROM EmployeProfile o INNER JOIN Organizations i ON o.OrganizationId = i.Id To extend that to only get the employee profile for "Joe Shmoe": .Where(g =&gt; g.EmployeeProfile.Name == "Joe Shmoe"); *EDIT* If you don't like the fluent syntax above: (from e in db.EmployeeProfile where e.OrganizationId == "Some Id" select e).Include(e =&gt; e.IntermediateRater) (from e in db.EmployeeProfile join o in db.Organizations on e.OrganizationId == o.Id //where e.Name == "Joe Shmoe" select new {EmployeeProfile = e, Organization = o}).Include(e =&gt; e.IntermediateRater)
Chances are there is a reference missing on the surface that is available on the laptop. So I would log exception to a log file, check stack trace for idea of where the error is. Once you know where, you can even put in some debug log messages to narrow it down further (since running the executable outside of VS won't show the exact line numbers). example: Log exception shows it's in the ClassA.DoStuff method public void DoStuff() { log.Debug("Entering DoStuff"); this.prop += 10; log.Debug("Added 10"); this.Foo(); log.Debug("Returned from Foo()"); } The more messages, the easier to debug, just make sure to remove the extra stuff that isn't needed for release once the bug is fixed. 
Are you familiar with regex? (regular expressions) public static String Substring(this String value, String startToken, String endToken, Boolean gotoend = false, Boolean escapeTokens = true) { String start = escapeTokens ? Regex.Escape(startToken); String end = escapeTokens ? Regex.Escape(endToken); String rxExp = start + "(.*" + (gotoend ? (end.Length &gt; 0 ? "?)(" + end + "|$)" : ")$") : "?)" + end); Regex rx = new Regex(rxExp); Match rxMatch = rx.Match(value); if (!rxMatch.Success &amp;&amp; gotoend) { //Check with no end token (go to end) rxExp = start + "(.*?)\\Z"; rx = new Regex(rxExp); rxMatch = rx.Match(value); if (!rxMatch.Success) return String.Empty; } else if (!rxMatch.Success) return String.Empty; return rxMatch.Groups[1].Value; } This is an extension to the String object (var selection = String.Substring("start", "end");), change the signature to the following if you want to use it like this (var selection = Substring(text, "start", "end);): public String Substring(String value, String startToken, String endToken, Boolean gotoend = false, Boolean escapeTokens = true) This uses regex (faster than standard substring method, usually) - if your start/end tokens have any of the following [ \ / . you will want to set the "escapeTokens" flag to true. If you want to use regex as your start/end tokens, set escapeTokens to false. Example of using regex in the start/end tokens: String.Substring(@"\d\d:\d\d(:\d\d)+", @"bob"); //Returns the string between any time-format (01:11:20) like a stopwatch or something, and the following "bob" - so if your text is "His time was 00:02:11 faster than bob's" would return "faster than"
Why would you suggest substring instead of RegEx? RegEx is faster (in most cases) for searching large text.
You know the saying... If you have a problem and solve it with a RegEx, you now have two problems.
Yeah, there's a relevant XKCD as well - but if you're reading a 10MB file, Regex will function noticeably faster than standard substring. If you're not familiar with Regex - definitely avoid it until you can't. But if you have a working snippet (as I provided him) - no reason not to use it. 
Tis true.
Form events aren't triggered when the form is in the background. Are you trying to make this global, so ANYTIME someone presses the left mouse button it does this? That seems like it wouldn't work well on its own - you'd need to write something that only reacts after the button has been held down (say, for a second or two) then stopped when it was released. In any case, to make this work globally while your form is not in focus you will probably need to do it in a similar fashion to hooking a global hotkey - you need to intercept it in the windows message queue through a platform invoke. I am on my phone right now, so I can't copy pasta any code to you, but Google global hotkey creation and then find the appropriate windows message id for a mouse click. This will as I said require a p/invoke, and you must be careful to implement IDisposable and release the hook.
That's a very interesting approach. I've been looking for ways to avoid having to transform objects when doing analysis. Perhaps dynamic might be a way to do this. 
Is downloads not a good measure of popularity? Nobody wants to rank libraries on a scale of stars, they just want to download them and use them.
Thank you. I've been looking for an easy tutorial on networking for ages! 
Wow.It really helped me.Thank you so much you kind redditor.
Have you tried uninstalling it? I didn't have any problems uninstalling 2010 or 2012. Just uninstall the Visual C++ libraries (in the add/remove programs list) as they're used by Windows via other applications.
I just checked for myself, and while the button in "Programs and features" may say only "Change", if you actually click the button you will get the option to uninstall it in the wizard! 
I've never had any issues installing or uninstalling Visual Studio. Microsoft does rigorous testing to make sure that you can install, use, and uninstall multiple versions (2010, 2013) and levels (Express, Pro) all side by side without any problems. 
I haven't known C# for very long although I think that it's better to use Objects as a way of managing your data because it is more organised and it can be easier to access more dynamic ways. Obviously it also gives you more control so you can change the get/set methods and you can create functions in the object's class to manipulate the data in the properties like changing the output formats or something. It seems like you don't need any of that for what you are doing although I believe that it is better coding practise.
Ah, alright, I suppose it was just a case of believing Internet hype and quitting too early! Thanks for all the replies and help guys. Appreciate it! 
Thanks. I'll look into this.
Multiple editions of VS should live happily together without issue. Uninstall is an option when you re-launch the installer from programs and features usually with VS installs. In general you should not run any other install processes while VS is doing its thing and its best to reboot and look for any updates to the OS and the IDE once you have completed the installs. 
Correct, for instance, in some language objects are basically defined as groupings of name value pairs. Sometimes the value is is function, but often it is just a piece of information describing the object. Think, "Person.HairColor" "Person.SkinColor" etc, obviously the person can do things too (Person.Attack) but linking these descriptors to an instance of an object is very important too. So, don't worry if your objects aren't "doing" anything with methods other than accessors/mutators. 
 I tend to world on a bases of promotion. eg You start with a class which has a few publc variables. Then the Variables become properties if it is required. What it really sounds like your doing it creating classes where you could get away with using a struct. Which is normally perfectly find in c# as the 2 are almost the same when used in that way structure (or class) + decentr data ownership are typically way better than a public ball of mess :)
 I normally would not think about doing it that way. I would do the locking with a mutex rather than a semaphore. Have a look at this implementation http://www.stev.org/post/2011/10/04/C-ThreadQueue-example.aspx I have another implementation somewhere that will cause the sleeping to work both ways. eg when the queue gets too full the writer will block. If you lock with a mutex your solution can be much more simple. It can also help with better manipulation later eg you can change the number of writers or the number of readers threads and are not required to match. 
Those are fine. They're typically called DTOs -- Data Transfer Objects. 
Yeah, it seems the bulk of the MVC websites I work on in C# have just that. Models. Lots of Models. Essentially these are classes with no methods. These models are instantiated, populated and manipulated by Controllers. 
Remember: objects either hide their data, or their methods. It is good practice to have objects which are just used to organize data in logical ways.
To display the images I have a picturebox on the form and assign the image to it. I move the picturebox to move the sprite.
Objects with no methods are generally called "models" (and often models still have some methods in them, albeit very simple ones). Models have a *huge* place in object-oriented programming. They allow you to represent a set of data while keeping it untied from it's source. Using models appears in the MVC pattern, MVVM pattern, Abstract factory pattern, and many others. If you think about it in terms of state (this gets a little bit into n-tier architecture and the repository pattern): * Models define state (current health, number of monsters, time of day, etc). At any given point in time the values contained by all the models represents the current state of the entire system. * A repository layer would control reading and writing that state from a store (database, file, memory, etc). * A logic layer would control how the state is accessed and the operations that can be performed on it. * The user interface displays the state and parses user input into logic layer calls. I say that having models is a **preferred** option, more often than not. Stick with it!
Models. They aren't DTOs unless storage and retrieval logic is baked into them. These days, I try to avoid creating DTOs and prefer dumb models with separate logic to build/save them.
Not necessarily. An object is just a logical collection of data and methods, it doesn't have to hide anything, and often will not.
I thought about using a struct but its more syntactically inconvenient IMO. 
Thank you this is an excellent answer!
Fair enough. I recommend reading OO theory books. Then forget about what you read as it doesn't apply to the real world. 
I beeline that visual studio 2013 does this for you. You click: Edit-&gt;Special Paste-&gt;Paste as JSON 
Yep. But not everyone has 2013 and for me personally I needed a place to explore the json. So it is two birds. In addition I hope to add non-.net languages as well as more tools and settings. I added bookmarklet functionality today as well. A lot of this stuff is tools to help me. Figured it might help others too. Thanks for your comments.
having no methods is the same thing as hiding all of your methods (to the user of that object).
{"employees": [ { "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" }, { "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" }, { "firstName": "Peter " , "lastName ": "Jones " } ] } public class Employee { public string firstName { get; set; } public string lastName { get; set; } public string lastName { get; set; } // Extra } From your example: There is an extra last name. Edit: I'm on iPad &amp; Chrome. Web dev is fun. 
The same in MVVM which I use for almost all of my WPF projects. It's often useful to separate the data from the business logic.
That's like, backwards. Models will typically have events to notify observers that a value/property changed, and code to load/save themselves (usually with the guts in a data-access layer or ORM). DTOs are pure data containers -- no logic, just a place to stash values. They're sometimes structs and not classes (depending on how much stack space is available and what your interoperability needs are). 
That sounds like it could be the issue. Moving pictureboxes on a form doesn't seem like the right way to do drawing. Consider following along with [this example code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sfwzeec0(v=vs.90\).aspx) and use [Graphics.DrawImage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/42807xh1(v=vs.110\).aspx) to draw the image instead. 
Funny, I found exactly that one when I googled for how to make a TCP server :D
This was a great response!
This is pretty cool! If I could give one idea, it would be to add the option to [generate properties in PascalCase](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229043.aspx) and add the JSON property name using the DataMember attribute. e.g. using System.Runtime.Serialization; public class Employee { [DataMember(Name = "firstName")] public string FirstName { get; set; } [DataMember(Name = "lastName")] public string LastName { get; set; } }
Added. Thanks for the suggestion. I used JsonProperty which is used with JSON.Net. Do you need a DataMember option?
I've been programming professionally for 25 years. I've watched techniques, tools, and methodologies come and go. What I've learned is, use the tools and techniques you have in ways that make sense and don't worry about perfect conformance to standard practices. If you waste your time worrying about things like "am I doing object orientation in an ideal way?" or "is this the *agile* way to do this task?" you'll never get anything done. If you use the aspects of everything that help you and facilitate you getting things done, and not worry about the rest, you'll get software written, and written software is usually better than unwritten software. :)
Holy moly that is a really handy tip. Just tried it myself and it works like a charm. Thanks!
"Written software is usually better than unwritten software." I am going to remember and reuse that quote for the rest of my life.
thanks this was an enlightening bit of information. I am mostly familiar with structs in c and c++ so I was unaware that they would be treated this way in c#
 No. Really this works with mutex's. You can sleep on them. The code would be way easier as well. Also a correctly constructed queue in this way will also deal with all the edge cases.
Why NoSQL? I doubt that OP has a huge amount of records or needs the scalability of a NoSql solution, and would probably benefit from having a strictly defined schema.
I think what you're calling a DTO is what I've seen called a Business Model (or View Model, in the case of observers). In the wild whenever I've seen something referred to as a DTO it's always had SQL or server calls built into it.
It's not just about big data performance, it's also about simplicity of design and [horizontal scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_scaling#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling). I actually don't have a whole lot of experience with NoSQL databases, other than RavenDB. With RavenDB for example, it is ridiculously easy to install and get started. You can just dump your objects into a database, and it handles all the serialization and storing details. You don't need to define a schema other than your domain/model classes, which you define anyway. Need to add a property to your class? Go for it, no need to update any schema.
Is it irrational to have methods inside these classes (objects) to, say, calculate two properties of the object? Or just have a helper class/object?
well types in c# are themselves quite different from those in most other languages. 
It's not irrational, but it depends on your need and architecture. I tend to leave anything that can be construed as logic in the logic layer: public class Model { DateTime? DateOfCompletion { get; set; } } public static class SomeHelper { public static bool IsCompleted(Model model) { return model.DateOfCompletion.HasValue(); } } public class SomeLogic { public void SomeMethod( Model model ) { var condition = SomeHelper.IsCompleted( model ); ... } } Similarly, I tend to leave anything that deals with display in the UI. Either through helpers, extensions, or view models: var displayName = string.Format("{0}, {1}", model.LastName, model.FirstName); The model represents and organizes the data, the logic manipulates the data, and the UI displays the data. Keeping the logic in the logic and the display formatting in the UI is one of the ways in which I maintain a separation of concerns.
Structs are used for atomic data or when you care about memory layout. Generally stick with class unless you have a reason not to.
Well I managed to make a query and get a response. Now I just have to figure out how to turn the JSON or XML I can get back into a collection of objects. The BingSearchContainer.cs you can use in WPF/WinForms is so much easier :D
Yup, I found it through google too. It's just difficult to filter out the good ones, I find.
Not exactly the cleanest code, but it should demonstrate the basic concepts. Feel free to improve it, or even start it from scratch. I am using [Open Broadcaster](https://obsproject.com/) to put all the windows together. This is where the actual Twitch stream comes into play. [Screenshot of it playing Final Fantasy](http://i.imgur.com/Tez7hDD.png)
And by not clean: I wrote it at 4am in 3-4 hours. Because why not...
I'm running with VS05, VS08, VS10, and had VS Express 12. All happily run together, tbf I don't use 5 and 8 so probably should uninstall them. But to install them click on change and it opens up a dialog where you can re-install etc. 
It's all good man! Great job!
&gt; The code should be documented by itself already (comments, pre- / post-conditions, proper names). This is a preference. A lot of people use unit tests as a documentation for how code acts in certain cases since it can be more precise than hand written documentation. You have to a degree a guarantee that the unit test is correct. &gt; I don't want test code in my productive systems / deployed to customer. Which is why the compiler needs to be able to exclude unit tests in a release build and make sure that the code is not referenced in the project. &gt; This will blow up the source files hugely. Test code is usually multiple times of the actual code. Now imagine your actual code always getting buried under a tons of test code. Not so fun. If you are worried about that you could always use partial classes. You also have code collapsing in the IDE. I think having the tests in the same place more or less as the code would make it easier to write tests, as well as looking up correct tests without having to do a code coverage first.
Awesome! I read the articles on [typecastexception.com](http://typecastexception.com/) about getting started with Identity, and got things up and running in an existing application in a couple days. Good, thorough writing. I'm definitely going to be reading this in the next couple days as group permissions are next on my plate.
Thanks for reading! I understand we should also be checking out IdentityClaims and IdentityClaimsManager . . .
With such a simple program, not much can go wrong. Well done.
I have heard (but can't find the reference anymore) that ToUpper() is preferred in culture-aware apps. My guess is one of the languages responds better to it. 
Thanks! I showed it off in /r/twitchplayspokemon and got a bunch of responses asking for source code. So I cleaned it up a little bit and threw it on github. My literal dev process: * borrow code from IRC bot example * borrow code from MMORPG bot (for key press in directinput) * write some key mappings It's funny how things like that works.
Copy pasting is the path of the modern programmer. For VS2013, there's even a plugin that searches Bing for code samples inside the editor. http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65 It's highly experimental, but pretty interesting. You can definitely use it for simple code, like "read file" or "download website".
I'd recommend calling your own function something different, like DrawMario() or something. That way, you won't get confused between your DrawImage(PaintEventArgs e), e.Graphics.DrawImage(), and this DrawImage() call in button1_Click. It looks like you need to set up the Form1_Paint callback as seen in this example: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.painteventargs.graphics(v=vs.110).aspx 
Excellent. Hopefully I'll have something to contribute to that discussion. ;)
To your point, test code has possibly additional dependencies that production code doesn't have which will increase the size of installs unnecessarily. There could also be license issues where you may use testing tools that are commercial and not allowed to be distributed. Changes can make test code break, so you would need the language feature to allow compilation with invalid test code because we don't always want to fix the test right away when changing code. But failing on errors is preferable when actually creating or modifying the actual test code. I would prefer to keep test code in separate assemblies than the stuff they are testing. Even if it was built in to the language I probably wouldn't use it. 
I have no idea. I suppose they limit search to specific sites (stack overflow, msdn) and use some crazy regex to identify C# code, then associate the code with the search word or the context of the current website.
Very nice. I was going to make a TwitchPlays style stream, but I've been too busy to start on it.
Any time, man. Email is on the blog, and you know where the GH repo is. :-)
It just seems like there are too many variables to get a clean set of code. It would need to pass through some reasonably complex regex validations. Then I would attempt to eval() the string in an enclosed environment (for safety... I don't even know how I'd do it though...), just to be absolutely sure the code is real and working. But even after all that, I still don't know if the code it found is the code I wanted. Complex stuff... Now I wanna know!!!
Consider creating an array of Labels mirroring their position on the GUI (after, obviously, the InitializeComponent method creates all your instances). Label[,] labels = new Label[,] { {label00, label01, label02}, {...} } Then instead of doing an ugly Find to get it by name, you have your references right at hand: labels[x,y].Text = "foo";
You could put the label objects into an [,] array too.
If you run the built-in code analysis with the Globalization rules from Microsoft, it tells you to prefer ToUpper over ToLower because some languages have characters that don't properly "round trip" back to the same character in upper case. See [CA1308](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386042.aspx)
There are many ways to skin this cat. You could create a two dimensional array ahead of time and assign the appropriate label to the right array element. Then reference that array to find the right label later. If you are using WPF I would do it totally different. I would create properties on the datacontext object that represent each slots state and I would use an enumeration instead of strings to represent the 3 states (clear, X, O). You do this so the compiler can detect typos. Then put a Grid or some other container in each slot in the game gui. It would bind to the property for its appropriate slot and use a data template that triggers on three values (clear, X, O) to decide which label to use. Instead of a Grid with datatemplates you could alternatively just use a Label like now but create a value converter that can convert that enum to a string.
Yea, it's pretty magical. You can do a lot by approximation though. But the feature is pretty dumb and you get a lot of bad results. Experimental, as said.
That must have been where I saw it. Thanks.
"Copy pasting is the path of the modern programmer." True, but I've seen some truly terrible code from people who think that that is an actual solution and actual programming, rather than a place to start from and rewrite it all.
I had already tried this, but it returns an error :/ A field initializer can not refer to the static field and the non-static method or property "TicTacToe.Form1.label00".* [here a screenshot](http://imgur.com/GiK5Id4) *sry had to translate the Error because im using VS in german, so it may not be 100% acurate although my english isn't too bad actually. EDIT: *facepalm* after initialize component ill try it tomorrow 
Programming is the best way to learn programming. Find a project you'd want to make, something that interests you, or you want to work towards, and start. It you have zero knowledge, go through this http://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/SmartConsoleSetup.aspx. The internet is the best resource you'll ever have. The question you asked is very common, and generally involves procrastination. Just dive in. 
Yeah, that seems to draw it correctly now. However I've run into a new problem. private void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { Bitmap Picture = Properties.Resources.MarioStandLeft; Picture.MakeTransparent(BackColor); e.Graphics.DrawImage(Picture, _x, _y); } This draws the image, but it doesn't give the image any transparency. I end up with a large white box around my image. What can I do?
books are shit, go out and do
Are you 100% certain that BackColor is set to the right color?
I changed the BackColor directly to Color.Transparent and now it works exactly the way I want it to! You have no idea how happy I am, I've been stuck at this problem for a week and was honestly starting to doubt I could do it, but now I've finally got it to work. Seriously, thank you so much.
I specifically sais that the compiler should remove unit test code in a release build which is why I claim it needs to be a language feature. Unused dependencies should be removed as well. So no license issue. The point of unit tests is to break the build if the test contract is broken. This is not any different with a separate solution. You can still ignore tests like you always could. The point of this is to make writing tests less of a hassle and keep them close to the code they actually test.
Anyone want to tell me why this is down voted? Its not exact code, and may not be the best way to go about solving this, but reflection WOULD solve this dudes problem of addressing non structured properties of an object by their names, which ARE structured.
Because it's simply wrong to use reflection for this kind of task. It may would solve his problem, but it's still the entirely wrong approach.
I somewhat disagree with some of the other comments, just because they learn best by just diving in and doing random tutorials online doesn't mean everyone does and isn't necessarily a sign of procrastination. Ok, rant over, in answer to your question, a month or two of Lynda or Pluralsight would be good if you learn well from video. I'd probably start with Pluralsight personally, but I know from recent experience that Lynda has some good courses as well (co-worker). Another thing you might try is find a local C# or .Net meetup or user group on your area and join that. Interesting topics and you may find a mentor who can steer you in the right direction.
It's not directly, it's using reflection. And it gets downvoted because it's the wrong approach for this problem. Simple as that. It does not matter if it works like that or if it answers the question. And this is absolutely NOT a "classic case for reflection".
Dynamically accessing properties by their names is not a classic case for reflection? Please tell me more.
&gt; The compiler can hardly know which dependencies are really used and which not. It may can figure it out for hardcoded stuff, but when dynamic stuff and reflection joins the game it's not an option anymore. So what? You mean because the code is no unbreakable it's pointless to implement? You are acting like every problem has exactly zero solutions. &gt; This can be really troublesome for projects where more than a few developer work on. When somewhere in part A a unit tests fails (for whatever reason), then part B can't continue anymore. Building and testing are two seperate steps and should be considered as such. Unless your are not using a version control system, this is hogwash. First of all, broken unit-tests does not keep you from working. Second this is only an issue if you are working on the same branch, and even then it's hardly an issue. If you're not using git and feature branches: use them. The point here is that I have worked on a lot of major applications written in C# and what I have learned is that people seldom write real unit tests. The solutions normally has a project called "unit tests" which in reality is little more than integration and system tests. I'm not saying you should abolish separate testing projects, but for the unit tests (those tests that run a single public function within a single component where every dependency is mocked) should reside beside the code it documents. It would make writing unit tests less intrusive in your workflow, and act as documentation easily accessible for the work you have done. References, compile time removal etc. is beside the point and hardly "unmovable mountains of resistance" to the idea like you portray. Currently you could actually do this, but it would be nice with a little more simple syntax and the possibility to actually remove (although it doesn't matter except for NuGet) the unit tests and that the compiler disallows using the unit tests outside of unit testing.
Take a look at the [C# yellow book](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/) it is a good beginners book. If you want more info on C# (or .NET in general) you can take a look at the free book list on [http://resrc.io](http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/#net-%28c%23--vb--nemerle--visual-studio%29)
I found the Bob Tabor's "C# Fundamentals" course on MVA (Microsoft Virtual Academy) or Channel9 to be a good. 
It could be a culture setting. If your OS culture specifies a comma as the decimal point, it'll throw that error. I'm not at my computer so this could be wrong, but doing `double tempValue = Double.Parse(test, CultureInfo.GetCulture("en-US"));` should fix that issue.
It has to do with the culture. Do this: *double tempvalue = Convert.ToDouble(test, System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);* or replace . with , *string test = "0,0000000000001"; double tempvalue = Convert.ToDouble(test);*

Don't lose track of the fact that you are learning a *language*. There was an article recently on (I think) /r/programming about which parts of the brain are engaged when a programmer programs. Mostly it is the language center. With that in mind, what you need to understand is that learning a language is mainly about learning the vocabulary, and secondarily about learning the grammar. Take the books that you already have, and start going through them. When you get to a word or topic that you don't understand, google it until you do. Here's a big one, and it's been mentioned several times by other people here: learn by programming. The parts of the brain involved in speaking a language are different than the parts of the brain involved in reading OR writing OR listening to a language. The same is true of programming. You can read books for 5 years, and you'll grasp the grammar of programming, but unless you actually do some programming along the way, you won't have learned to *actually program.* SQL is different from c# enough that most of your SQL skills won't carry over. The'll complement, but not really carry over. HTML and CSS don't carry over at all, but they are highly useful if you intend to write code professionally, because mostly c# is used to write asp.net applications. **tl;dr** learn the vocabulary of c# from the internet until you grok the books you already have, and program a lot.
Are you sure your device expects UTF8, and not something like ASCII?
I could have separated declaration and initialization to make that clearer. But yes, the array will be another field of your class, and you will assign the various label instances inside the constructor.
Even when ASCII is technically 7 bits, every character is still 1 byte (8 bit). You never read and write bits, the lowest data you handle is always a whole byte. The question is what kind of text encoding does your remote party send and expect in return? It is most likely ASCII, in which case you should just use `Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(str)`. edit: &gt; I can successfully send and receive the packet, with the binary data can be any number between 0 and 255, which when passed to the form is encoded as a String. Do you actually really deal with strings? Or is it just bytes? Because this quote and "attempt to preserve all 8 bits" sounds really confusing. If you want to display raw byte data in your farm, then displaying it in a hex form is WAY better than a normal string.
Thanks for your reply! Do you know a way to open a text file in excel or a csv file? Also, do you know how to add text to the end of specific lines in a text file? Like, thisLine = thisLine + ",string". So it writes that string to the end of the line and then opens it in excel in a column next to it. Really appreciate your help!
If you found C# in a Nutshell too technical then stay away from Sams Teach Yourself In 24 Hours. To me, that was even worse. I also agree about Head First.
What version of .net are you using? Edit: Actually: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/472906/net-string-to-byte-array-c-sharp
Well, using strings instead of byte arrays, when you're dealing with byte arrays and not with strings, was a huge mistake in your design. :-) I would encourage you to change your design accordingly. Even if it's more work now, it will pay out afterwards. Especially when you come back after a time to look at your code and think "why the f.. am I using strings here?What's with all this weird encodingsh*t?". If you need to continue like this, take a look at Archangelles response on how to transform a string to a byte array, without considering any encodings.
Thanks for the reply, I'll definitely try that. I think I wrote the first part of that question wrong though. I want to open a text file as a csv file in excel, do you know how to do that?
Exactly how I said. Data-&gt;From Text File. In the wizard, select delimited, set delimiter to ',' (comma). Follow rest of wizard.
I really like python's [doctest](http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html). Given a method that simply returns `'Hello World!'`, you would just write: def say_hello(): """ Says hello to the world. &gt;&gt;&gt; say_hello() 'Hello World!' """ return 'Hello World!' to include a unit test created from the docstring. You could do something similiar with C#'s XML documentation and Roslyn. 
When I go to data in C# it only shows, Show data resource or add new data resource though.
You said "How do I open text as CSV in excel" - I told you how to open it in Excel. If you want to open CSV in C# that's a different question.
That's a tricky one :) One approach might be to build up a set of all answers derived from the sum of two integers; then for each answer you can add each third element once, to get the set of answers derived from three integers... A visual example with the list [3, 52, 45, 61]: Step 1: Get the set of all answers comprised of two integers: * [3 + 52] (A) * [3 + 45] (B) * [3 + 61] (C) * [52 + 45] (D) * [52 + 61] (E) * [45 + 61] (F) Step 2: Now, for every answer, add every number that is so far not included: * (A) -&gt; [3 + 52 + 45] (AA) * (A) -&gt; [3 + 52 + 61] (AB) ... etc. And repeat again for each additional number in the list, in that fashion. Disclaimer: That was just off the top of my head, no guarantees :)
hmm yea this could work, but how would i go about storing the solutions? i need some way to dynamically save and retrieve the solutions
This is by no mean to most efficient way to do this, if nothing else because it uses LINQ's Skip and is recursive, but it gets the job done for small collections... public static class ExtensionMethods { public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetAllSums(this IReadOnlyCollection&lt;int&gt; source) { for (int n = 2; n &lt;= source.Count; n++) { foreach (var combination in GetAllSumsOfNItems(source, n)) { yield return combination; } } } private static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetAllSumsOfNItems(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; source, int n) { if (n == 0) { yield break; } if (n == 1) { foreach (var item in source) { yield return item; } } int counter = 0; foreach (var item in source) { counter++; var sourceReduced = source.Skip(counter); foreach (var item2 in GetAllSumsOfNItems(sourceReduced, n - 1)) { yield return item2 + item; } } } } void Main() { var sums = (new[] { 1,10,100 }).GetAllSums(); }
You can execute sting as code with CSharpCodeProvider; however that's a pretty terrible way to solve this problem. Create a recursive method GetSubsets which given set S and cardinality n returns set S' of all subsets of size n. Then for loop over S from 2 to S.Count calling this method and iterating over the results with a foreach loop: var s = new List&lt;int&gt;{3,52,45,61,8}; for (var i = 2; i&lt;=s.Count; i++) foreach(var ss in GetSubsets(s,i)) DoSomething(ss); Now you only need to solve an easier problem, implementing GetSubsets(). Think about this recursively. Solve for i=1. Then think about how you would extend for i=2.
oh wow thanks for this. i have a few questions though. what is type 'var' , and what does the Skip() method do? also what is an IEnumerable, and how does yield return work? sorry if these are basic, but i'm writing this program as an intro to C# 
also why did you choose to make the class static?
Oh sorry, I want to open the text file in excel programatically using C#. Is that possible?
Using Excel Interop: http://www.dotnetperls.com/excel (works for all versions of Excel sheets: xls, xlsx, xlsm, etc.) - ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CLOSE YOUR Excel.Application object or it will lock your file(s). Using ClosedXML: https://closedxml.codeplex.com/
This is java, but I'm hoping it helps shed light on the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16591677/encoding-and-decoding-utf-8-byte-arrays-from-and-to-strings "when you convert the encrypted data into a String, the "invalid" characters are most likely getting replaced with the ? invalid char. If you want to convert arbitrary binary data (aka encrypted data) into a String, you need to use some binary-&gt;text conversion like Base64." here is a more relevant link to try: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14057434/how-can-i-transform-string-to-utf-8-in-c
so should GetSubsets() return a list/array of all the solutions? or would it be returning individual combinations? 
The static class and method here is a requirement for the technique he is using. He is creating "Extension Methods". These are methods that get added to a type outside of the type's source code. For example, let's say you wanted all strings to have a new method on them that returns a boolean if the string can be converted to a number. You want to be able to do this: string possibleNumber = "123ABC"; if(possibleNumber.IsNumber()) { //Do stuff } Unfortunately, you don't have access the .NET String class source code to just edit it and add a new method. But, you can do what tme___sis did above. public static class StringExtensions //this name doesn't matter { public static bool IsNumber(this string text) { float num; return float.TryParse(text, out num); } } Notice how the method above has the word "this" in the signature. That is the key here. That tells the C# compiler that this is an extension of the String class. Now you can call your new method on any instance of a String.
It seems I've spoke too soon, apparently using this method means my gif is no longer animated. Is there an easy way around this?
Notice GetAllSumsOfNItems has return type IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;. But there isn't an IEnumerable being returned anywhere in the function. How does that work? If a function returns IEnumerable, and uses yield return, then that function is converted into a state machine by the C# compiler! The items iterated over by the IEnumerable are "yield return"ed one at a time by the state machine.
Apologies for making the code more complicated than it needed to be, I didn't realise you were just getting into the language; I probably would have done some things a little differently with that in mind... /u/Angry_Apathy has done a great job at answer most of those questions, but I'll try to field this one. `yield return` is essentially the same as Python's `yield` keyword (which you seem to have some familiarity with) with `IEnumerable&lt;&gt;` taking the place of Python's `generator`. It's used to allow you to `foreach` over the items 'lazily', i.e. without having to calculate the entire list up-front. StackOverflow has some [useful](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410026/proper-use-of-yield-return) [information](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39476/what-is-the-yield-keyword-used-for-in-c) on `yield return`. --- If you're looking for a particular value, you're probably wanting to iterate over the result, doing your comparisons, like so: void Main() { var numbers = new int[] { 1, 10, 100 }; var sums = numbers.GetAllSums(); foreach (var sum in sums) { if (sum == 101) Console.WriteLine("found it!"); Console.WriteLine(sum); } }
If you don't need the results to be returned in that specific order, you could do the following. var mySums = ( from binary in Enumerable.Range(0, (int)Math.Pow(2, myList.Count)) select (from bit in Enumerable.Range(0, myList.Count) where ((binary &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; bit)) &gt;&gt; bit) == 1 select myList[bit] ).Sum() ); I don't believe you can do better asymptotically than O(n 2^n ) in the length of your list, but this code probably doesn't have a great constant factor. EDIT: thanks /u/cbann, forgot a set of parentheses. This solution provides, for every subset of your original list, the sum of that subset. **This includes the empty set and singleton subsets**, so if that's not what you want, then it's not suitable for you. If you want to exclude empty and singleton subsets, it would look more like: var mySums = ( from binary in Enumerable.Range(0, (int)Math.Pow(2, myList.Count)) let subset = (from bit in Enumerable.Range(0, myList.Count) where ((binary &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; bit)) &gt;&gt; bit) == 1 select myList[bit] ).ToList() where subset.Count &gt; 1 select subset.Sum() ); And now that I think of it, you can return results in order of subset length as you'd originally asked by doing: var mySums = ( from binary in Enumerable.Range(0, (int)Math.Pow(2, myList.Count)) let subset = (from bit in Enumerable.Range(0, myList.Count) where ((binary &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; bit)) &gt;&gt; bit) == 1 select myList[bit] ).ToList() where subset.Count &gt; 1 orderby subset.Count select subset.Sum() );
Yeah I think excel is going to complicate a lot of things, especially because there are so many commas in the file that already exist. It makes it look like crap in excel. I have another solution, but need some help with implementation. Do you think I could open the txt file in a richtext format and then highlight the different keywords in different colors?
http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/ If your CSV file is text qualified, like this: "Bob", "Saggat", 4, "Comedian, Actor", 12345 "Jim", "Bob", 20, "Unemployed", 65431 When you import the data in Excel, make sure you click "Text Qualified", it will then keep "Comedian, Actor" in one column - instead of two.
Not in this case; you'd have to write the method differently to get that info (e.g. so that it returned a Nullable&lt;float&gt; that was null if TryParse failed and with Value num).
No its just a whole lot of useless data thats being recorded by tools that people at my job work with. So with Scintilla I can highlight text inside a text file?
Scintilla is a form control that you can add to a windows form application (File -&gt; New Project -&gt; Windows Form Application), that lets you highlight/format/etc. As you are not being very descriptive as to what you're actually trying to do, that's the best I can do.
You're not changing from little-endian to big are you?
As others have said, its pretty straight forward - the bytes you are converting do not represent a UTF8 string. Based on your other replies to this thread, I can conclude that there are two probable reasons for this: - The string being sent to you is not UTF8. The bytes you have shown us do not represent a UTF8 string, plain and simple, so maybe the other side is using a different encoding. - Alternatively, the bytes you are decoding from contain other non-string information in them, such as your start, stop, or checksum bytes. If this is the case, you need to extract the appropriate bytes and only convert those. Additionally, just because something is stored as a string in memory does not necessarily mean its a human readable string. If the data being represented is not intended to be human readable, just stored as a string, then a base64 string might be a better way to go.
Your solution is incorrect. Given the input {1,2,3}, op asked for an output of {3,4,5,6} ({1+2,1+3,2+3},{1+2+3}). Your solution produces {0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6}.
Sounds like you are overcomplicating your approach. Have you considered using a Dictionary &lt;ClassA, ClassB&gt; to represent the relationship?
 var s = new List&lt;int&gt;{3,52,45,61,8}; for (var i = 2; i&lt;=s.Count; i++) foreach(var sum in GetSubsetSums(s,i)) DoSomething(sum);
You might have to animate it yourself. Use a service like http://gif-explode.com/ to get the individual frames from the animation and periodically change which of those you're showing on screen.

Hi there thanks for the response. There is exactly one A per B. I should actually have actually clarified that I wanted to do this in the most efficient way possible for performance reasons. I was thinking of using a linq expression as opposed to a foreach. To expand on the situation: Our main web page on average shows 1000 client jobs for our worst client. At the moment the page loads all the jobs from one stored procedure which is nice and efficient, all jobs in one go, however it does a data bind for each of those jobs and does all kinds of crazy looping over each of the jobs properties to establish what is associated with each job and then renders the HTML accordingly. Each job is represented by a class, lets call it Job. What I have done is created another class, let's call it JobWebPage, with all the pre-computed values for the job. These values are figured out once and only once and saved to the database. The reason that I have two lists is this: All jobs are loaded in one go, nice and quick, however if there are 1000 jobs I do not want to have to call the database 1000 times to initialise all of the JobWebPage properties on each of the objects. To get around this I have another SP to load all the JobWebPage objects from one stored procedure. What I want to do is this: Load all the jobs into a list in one database call as it does currently, then load all of the JobWebPages into another list in one database call, and then assign all of the JobWebPage objects to their associated Job in the most efficient way possible. What I will end up with is just 2 database calls, and the code will not have to do calculations for every job on load as the JobWebPage property for each job already has the values computed. If I can I would like to avoid a foreach as I tried this and it is quite slow in matching all the values. Does this make sense?
OK. That makes more sense... I see what you did there. Essentially you enumerated over all 2^n bitmasks of length n where the bitmask indicates whether or not the element belongs in the subset corresponding to the bitmask. That would certainly work if order is not important, and your method of excluding the empty and singleton subsets takes care of removing those values. That's an interesting solution.
&gt; I should actually have actually clarified that I wanted to do this in the most efficient way possible for performance reasons. I was thinking of using a linq expression as opposed to a foreach. These things are rarely aligned. LINQ is often elegant and "fast enough", but it's not especially fast compared to other methods for most problems. &gt;If I can I would like to avoid a foreach as I tried this and it is quite slow in matching all the values. There's not some magic bullet that's going to reduce the amount of work you have to do. If the complexity of your current solution matches the snippet I posted above, You're going to need to look elsewhere for performance improvements. &gt;Does this make sense? Not even a little bit.
Lol. Forget what I just said and go back to the class A and Class B bit from the original question. Is the foreach loop you posted the fastest way to do this then?
&gt;Essentially you enumerated over all 2n bitmasks of length n where the bitmask indicates whether or not the element belongs in the subset corresponding to the bitmask. Exactly. There may have been a better naming for the variables to get that idea across. &gt;That would certainly work if order is not important You can stick an orderby subset.Count in there to make the order correct, but that effectively means the whole list of subsets must be in memory at once instead of being able to lazily produce sums.
Sure, it's understandable, string used to just mean a char array, where char is a byte or a word or something that is a fixed bit count. But with UTF8 it really isn't. It sounds like you've used the wrong type in the core of your program, well one of the pluses of C# is how robust it is and easy to refactor. I like to paraphrase Dijkstra at times like this *if refactoring is the act of removing flaws from software, programming must surely be the art of adding flaws*. If after reading Jeff's link, you have any questions, feel free to post and I'm sure we will try to awnser them. You get that the *corruption* happened at 128 (ie overflow for 7bit int) right? Hopefully it makes sense why this is normal behaviour. High level languages let you hide from certain complexities, such as rich character sets, but when you don't understand them, they will bite you. I guess I am saying don't be pissed off with such things, there are big benefits to the immutable string model in C# vs something you'd get in most embedded C compilers. Let's also not ask me about my TCP stack I wrote for a PIC16 series in MASM and all the serious issues that had....

Looks like fizzbuzz with less fizzbuzz and more fizz, buzz. The [lambda expression](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx) .Where is pulling whatever "A" (I assume an integer) is divisible by 3 or 5. Does this actually run? I would expect the where to have to be: ~~.Where(A =&gt; (A % 3 == 0) || A=&gt; (A % 5 == 0))~~ ~~...making sure that the 'A=&gt;' part is reiterated in the second part of that or statement. Although I am probably wrong.~~ I was wrong. 
Where is and extension method on IEnumerable witch returns an IEnumerable. The predicate (the clauses in the parens) is a lambda function using the modulus operator to find the numbers in the collection that are divisible by 3 or 5. Returning { 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 ... 100 } The modulus operator returns the remainder of division. Example, 12 % 10 returns 2 because 10 goes into 12 one time with 2 left over. Its often used to check is a number is even, x % 2 == 0 is true if x is even. I think that covers everything, there are a number of concepts in your question, if you want me to attempt to explain a specific one in more detail just ask.
No. There's no universal way to get this information. When most applications have a file open as a document, what they really have is the contents of the file in memory, and a string telling them where to save the file if the user asks for it to be saved. There are some technical reasons for this, but the end result is: Short of digging around inside the application, you can't get this information. This is less true for applications that need to deal with larger binary files, but even then, it's hit or miss as to if they'll keep a handle to file open through the duration of the application presenting to the user having the file open. For some applications, like the Office Apps, there might be ways to ask them for that filename via a COM interface, or other means, but this is by no means universal. 
I could just change my query to get back JSON, the API supports it. Strangely I don't have that paste-special option in my VS, perhaps because it's the express version? I could manually make a class, though, that's not so hard with only a few properties. What would I need to look into to parse the JSON to get the data into instances of my objects? Does .NET have some class for that? 
Tried this? http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=272626&amp;clcid=0x409
That looked promising, but right now they only have support for the maps it appears. 
That's an OData feed. Use oData client from nuget
Simple. It returns all the elements that are divisible by 3 or 5. Let's take the argument to .Where first: A =&gt; (A % 3 ==0) || (A % 5 == 0) this is a lambda expression, a form of anonymous method. In this case it's equivalent to: bool fizzbuzz(int A) { return (A % 3 == 0) || (A % 5 == 0 ); } This method returns true only if A is divisible by 3 or 5. .Where returns a list of elements where that function returns true ie. it returns every element in the list (0 - 1000) that is divisible by 3 or 5.
Thanks I'll check it out. 
Even if there was a way to check if the local machine has a file open, what if the file is on a network fileshare and some other computer has the file open? So there's no real way.
.Where() is a Linq extension method for classes inheriting from iEnumerable. It will iterate through each value in your selected range, returning a list of elements that meet the conditions provided by the predicate (substituted with a lambda expression here) that it takes as a parameter. A lambda expression can take the place of a delegate and/or the method that it encapsulates. So, the A represents each value in your range as it is looped through. It is passed as a parameter to the rest of the code in your predicate or lambda expression. This just tests to see if the given value is divisible by 3 or 5. If either of those tests return true, the value is added to the new list.
If you can get JSON, I would do that and then use http://james.newtonking.com/json
that expression is the same as int sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) { if(i % 3) sum += i if(i % 5) sum += i }
In your case some elements will be added twice if they are divideable by 3 and 5. Should change the second if to else if
I'm still struggling. Does the column index include hidden columns? 
Yes thats what i did and it worked thank you 
Thanks for the explanation! :)
I recommend to find complete applications (GitHub, CodePlex, MSDN samples) and play around with it: compile it, play with it as an enduser, then step through the code with breakpoints, use Locals, Watch, Callstack, IntelliTrace, use the Class View to understand the namespaces and their classes and methods and try to predict what it does. Then remove some code and try to write it yourself. With this "dive in" method you're being active, while you're passive with reading books and watching video's.
Those are quite a lot of dependencies... Which are not even necessary when you'd provide a separate .NET 4.5 version.
JSON Serializer either with what comes with .NET or JSON.NET NuGet package can convert a JSON response into a proper collection of objects.
Yeah that looks like just the ticket!
Oh I'm sorry about that. What I have to do is load a text file that contains thousands of lines of data. Read it. Then highlight specific keywords or phrases with different colors. 
Yes, even if a column isn't visible in the UI, it's still part of the grid. Also, to clarify indexing starts at 0 for the columns. 
Well Newtonsoft.JSON saves the day. Just used [This](http://json2csharp.com/) web-app to convert my JSON to c# classes for me automagically and the json.net lib just deserializes it easy-peasy.
Thanks for the reply. Yea thats what I thought. It builds without error, but it doest fill the cell. I'm also getting a NoNullAllowed exception.. :( Some more questions you may be kind enough to answer: 1.If I set a field on the table not to allow nulls and then I set the default value to (getdate()), should I: a. include this cell in the dataset. (I think I should because I may need to draw this info elsewhere) b. include this cell in the datagrid (I thought I would need to, now I'm not sure, the user does not need to see it, it is hidden) c. manually assign a value to this cell if the default will add the date and time? (I thought I wouldnt, but I'm getting the NoNullAllowedException on this cell.) 2.Could I not fire the auto fill code (yours) to run when the second cell is populated from a drop down? Something like this: if (stockCode != null || suffixCode != null) { cell.value = stockCode + SuffixCode; } Where would I put this piece of code? in the same place as before? 3.Is there any advantage to using HeaderText over DataPropertyName or is it the same thing. Thanks again for the help. 
Also a concise solution to the age old FizzBuzz interview question, easily expanded for Fizz/Buzz/FizzBuzz: Enumerable.Range(0, 1000).Where(n =&gt; (n % 3 == 0) || (n % 5 == 0)).Select(n =&gt; (n % 3 == 0 &amp;&amp; n % 5 == 0) ? "FizzBuzz" : (n % 5 == 0 ? "Fizz" : "Buzz"));
Yeah, got any ideas?
Create a new Windows Form Application project, under the main form add a Scintilla control, read in text file on form load - follow docs on scintilla on how to highlight.
That's interesting. Reminds me about Nemerle project and awesome PEG parser I used for my own tasks.
First thing, I don’t think you want the CellContentClick event. This event requires the cell to already have some sort of content in it, likely text in this case. It seems like you want the CellClick event. This will run the code regardless just by clicking the cell. 1 – I’m not able to follow this question. I think there’s just too much going on in the project that I don’t know about to answer this. 2 – You can absolutely prevent the code from running if that is how you want the application to work. The adjustment I would make is to move your validation to the top of your event. What this accomplishes is a speed increase. Include your validation in the initial if-statement. To clean up the code you can do something similar to the code below. 3 – It actually doesn’t matter because in the validation the index is already checked. We know that column X (2 in my example, 3 in your original although you were checking the row) is the “Code” column. So, this if-statement isn’t needed because it is technically redundant. If you really do want to check the row too then check them both during validation. I wouldn’t ever check the ColumnName nor the DataPropertyName. And no, ColumnName and DataPropertyName are not the same thing. I’d stick with the index because there is a higher chance that a column name or property name can change and then your code will fail due to hardcoding. If you add/remove columns, then you know to go through the code behind and adjust column indexes accordingly. In general, avoid hard-coded text whenever possible. private void dataGridView1_CellClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) { // Validation if (e.ColumnIndex != 2 || string.IsNullOrEmpty(dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[0].Value.ToString()) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[1].Value.ToString())) return; // It is valid, set the cell to whatever data we need var cell = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[e.ColumnIndex]; var stockCode = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[0].Value.ToString(); var suffixCode = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[1].Value.ToString(); cell.Value = stockCode + suffixCode; } So, my new code is closer to the way I would’ve coded. I tried to keep my initial example close to your original code so that it would make sense and simply answer the question. What this does is validate that anything should run at all. If 1 part is invalid, then the return statement will send the user back reducing time and memory needed. Below, you will see a cleaner way to do validation. private void dataGridView1_CellClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) { // Validation if (!IsValidateCellClick(e)) return; // It is valid, set the cell to whatever data we need var cell = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[e.ColumnIndex]; var stockCode = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[0].Value.ToString(); var suffixCode = dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[1].Value.ToString(); cell.Value = stockCode + suffixCode; } private bool IsValidateCellClick(DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) { return e.ColumnIndex == 2 &amp;&amp; dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[0].Value != null &amp;&amp; dataGridView1.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[1].Value != null; } So, what I’m doing here is turning my validation into a function. The only purpose this serves is to clean up the code, but it reduces line of code in the event and also self-documents what is happening in the if-statement. Also, notice that I’m checking to see if the value is null instead of validating the ToString(). ToString() will throw an exception if Value is null so you will likely need to check both cases and can add onto IsValidateCellClick() with anything you need. (i.e. Value.ToString() is not null or empty. If you’re using VS2010 or later, use string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(…Value.ToString()) Keep in mind that all of these coding example are just a guideline for you. I built them and they work against my simplified test app. I’m hoping you can take the concepts and implement them as you need in your code to get it functioning. Edit: Just trying to organize code again so it's readable. 
I work for a financial software company, our main product is written in c# and is a web application (SAAS) this: JB: How about for web applications? DD: I've got no experience really, C# is typically used only in Windows environment. Java would be better for web applications. Each language has its own strengths. I could not agree less, .Net / MVC is far superior imho to java web development! &lt;/rant&gt; 
I think it really depends on the implementation details and how complex your logging process is. Generally, its good to "Program to an interface" as you did with your ILogger class. What i would probably do is instantiate the proper logger (DB, file) according to the situation and register it inside a "container", which would be accessible across your application. So you'd have something that goes like: var logger = new MyAwsomeLogger(); container.RegisterInstance(logger); and then when you'd want to reach out and log you'd go: var logger = container.get&lt;ILogger&gt;(); and you'd get the proper logger :)
At first glance I'd guess its because your cycling the graphics between draw events, try adding timer code to change the texture every 1000ms
Any particular reason why you are using an ArrayList?
Sorry, the problem is this tileTexture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(tileType); = this error: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Why?
Tile is a class in your example. Within Tile's constructor, you utilize Content.Load() to load your resource. My question is, are you attempting to instantiate a Tile class *before* the Content object has been instantiated? Because if you are, Content would be null, and thus "Not set to an instance of an object" yet. Edit: You can also use Visual Studio's built in debugging to determine which objected is giving you the issue. "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" occurs when something has not be instantiated yet but you are trying to use it as though it has been. When your program encounters the issue it will stop and highlight the problem line of code. Hover over the object names and drill into them to determine which object is giving you the problem. You can even take steps back through the [Call Stack](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a3694ts5.aspx) window and see if your program is executing the way you think it is, or if it is doing something you don't expect, and correct accordingly.
If you're worried about the file changing after you've opened it, you could use the filesystemwatcher object to listen for events about files being changed/moved/deleted. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher.changed(v=vs.110).aspx
Generate a random 3 digit integer between 180 - 235, cast to a float and divide by 10. float temperature = ((float)randNum)/10f;
Sigh. Whatever happened to Nemerle? I had high hopes when JetBrains took it on for their in-house development that we'd see it - and the VS support for it - pushed forwards radically. But now it's like two years later, and nothing :-(
I think it means the Decimal type.
ok, I figured it out now, but it isn't even drawing, even when in the draw loop.
Im really not good at this yet just started out monday and have gone through super basic stuff and i guess this also is basic but i find it hard. ive done this so far - my brain is totally fried since ive done this from 8 am and its now 0.30 am.. Random rng = new Random(); 
Are you looking for a decimal type, or just a number with a fractional component (i.e a floating point number, 3.14 for example).
Im looking for the floating point number, for example 20.5 Celsius
You said you have been generating Integers already? Do the same. Have a look at the [Random documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random.aspx) to find out how to generate integers within a range. Use the generated integer with my previous comment.
Did you really just post a client's source on the internet with one line of relevant code to answer a question?
Just wanted to point out that using a float in the denominator will ensure that floating point division is used, so you don't have to cast randNum.
Thank you all for your insight I find that videos are simpler for me to comprehend. I will give pluralsight a try depending on the cost along with Microsoft visual c# 2013. I found the dummies c# 5.0 book written poorly in the beginning explanations. I did some c# at my job 5-6 years ago but got lost on namespaces and collections, never got to linq which is supposed to be awesome! Thanks for the valuable insight will keep updated Dee from ny

I totally agree that a language having unit testing built in is a great feature to have. I have played with D a little bit myself and I do like the built in unit testing. I think the point that some people in the comments missed is you have to TELL the compiler to build the unit tests in the case of D. It would ignore unit testing otherwise. As someone who spends his day in C and C++, I would love to have a language that has unit testing built in and organic to the language.

Hey I just wanted to let you know I ended up buying a DI book (Manning's DI in C# .NET). I've read a few chapters and the gears are turning. I've been refactoring the server (started today) and will let you know when I think it's in better shape. :)

Does the program need set the address or the subject of the email? Can copy and paste not suffice unless the previous conditions are required?
ELI5?
No thats not needed just the copy pasting part EDIT: and pasting ;)
Hm no, I need to know when the file is no longer open so I can unlock it on a remote server (don't ask, not my idea :P ). Thanks anyway :) But since it's mentioned, I used FSW to track changes (with write time filter) on a folder with files, but it kept missing file saves when they were done in rapid succession - should a FSW instance be initiated for each file and subscribe to the same changed event? I read that sometimes events can be missed if the thing has a stack overflow (when working on folders with recursion), but no exceptions were thrown in my case...
Uh, is there any reason Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V won't work? It'd be one thing if you were talking about automating this process, but it sounds like you basically want to have a couple of buttons that accomplish this task manually. You're trying to make something that is *very* simple into something very very complicated.
The reason is that I'm doing a work experiance job for school and my boss need a program that copys surtent text form mutiple files in to one file and make email of it. the point of is to make a offer of it to. so one click on the button shut be able to copy and paste is in the the other file. I hope I made it a bit more clear. Edit: It for that the colleges don't have to type and eddit the context all the time for the offer
So what you actually want to do is this: 1) Open a given Word document and copy the text of the document and 2) Create a new Outlook email with the contents of the Word document(s) Correct? This should be possible using the Office APIs to automate this process. For example, [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y1xatbkd%28v=vs.80%29.aspx). Googling "C# office automation" should help.
Yes, this is one of the PCL problems... I'll separate each platforms to reduce dependencies.
A parser generator (sometimes called a "compiler compiler" for the more famous YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler)) is used to generate the part of a programming language used to read the written text and transform it into something more manageable (Normally a syntax tree but bad compilers just output instructions. \*cough\*PHP\*cough\*) You specify a formal syntax using simple rules and tokens (tokens are normally extremely simple regular expression patterns) and the parser generator creates a state machine that reads the input character by character and transition between states and output code in another language (in this case C#). You could try this out. C# already has an expression tree system built-in for LINQ (which you will find in System.Linq.Expressions) that can output CLR instructions. The advantage of this parser generator is that your compiler will be a standalone compiler. The more common ANTLR and GOLD relies on a Dll reference for the state machine handling whereas this will simply output everything your program requires which is a big advantage. edit: you are not required to create a compiler of course. You can interperate your language in run-time if you wish.
thnx, but I think it easer to copy it to a other word doc 
Yes, exactly.

The Duality engine core is built on .Net and based on OpenGL and OpenAL using bindings provided by the OpenTK library. Although Windows is the only platform that Duality it is currently developed and tested on, porting to other platforms should be entirely within reach.
Hmm. Saved to favorites :) 
That's remarkably useful. Yeah, sure, we shouldn't be using nested accessors like that but anyone working with a 3rd party WCF service, for example, will find this unavoidable. In the mean time I've been using this extension method: public static class NotNullExtension { public static TResult IfNotNull&lt;TSource, TResult&gt;(this TSource source, Func&lt;TSource, TResult&gt; accessor, TResult @default = default(TResult)) where TSource : class { return source != null ? accessor(source) : @default; } }
BEST THING EVER. I need these every 2 minutes. When will it be added ?
Haha, very nice. I also wrote a C# "Twitch Plays" type program (well, two actually: one is a console bot that randomly sends commands and the other is the IRC side). Mine can control just about any emulator, including NES/SEGA/PSX. http://iyouboushi.com/projects/programs/c/emulation-control/ (source code is in the 7z along with both programs) I'm almost done with release 008 which will introduce Anarchy vs Democracy mode too. Still, it's always nice to see how other people accomplish the same thing. 
this is pretty clever.
probably the next major version. .net 5?
I think this is not .NET related, so more like C# 6.
Nope. I've been through those, and they don't tell me how to programmatically log in to a specific Google account using this asinine OAuth 2 protocol, only how to pop up an impractical browser window for the Google account credentials to be entered manually and the API access to be authorized manually.
They just thought of this?? This should've made it in C#2.0 specs ...
Thanks for posting, I'll definitely be making use of this! 
That's the documentation for v2. I'm using v3. It supports OAuth2.
I can't wait to do something like this: object foo; var baz = foo as Foo ?. Bar as Bar ?. Baz as Baz ?? new Baz(); Too many times have I run into poorly thought out frameworks where nearly everything is an object or very high-level abstraction. This is going to help clean all of that up.
Reminds me of something I saw a while ago about using Expression objects to iteratively evaluate all the steps. A google search couldn't find the one I had in mind; I did find [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/a/144982/1269654) which is similar but looks extra complicated (or checks additional usages) than what I remember. Also, this seems like a good candidate to instead have it cache the expressions and use `Reflection.Emit` (or Expression compilation) to generate a fully optimized method (not unlike the nested `if` check example in the posted blog entry). Of course, by C# 6, it will be mostly obsolete.
It seems like you're creating an extra function to do a small amount of simple work, but that issue aside... Your collection (array, list, whatever) needs to live outside of the scope of the function which is adding to it. Either create it in the "sqlFunction" and pass it as another parameter to the setValuesToArray, or declare it in some global scope (which is probably a bad idea, but without a lot of context I can't really say.) That said, depending on the types being returned by your "do sql" pseudo-code, you may be able to just leverage LINQ and Enumerable&lt;T&gt;.ToArray or .ToList extension methods and save yourself a lot of unnecessary lines of code.

This looks amazing.
I've been waiting for something like this for a while. I have been using an extension to do this and was forced to use lambda expressions to make it work. This will be way more compact and faster.
Easier still to use VBA.
If it has a chance of making you write less code, then it will never be in Java.
Yes, stay classy .. sling poo at someone else not even remotely referenced in my comment ... Groovy offers this exact syntax ("?.") with compatibility to JVM 7 class libraries ... The jackass author makes a point of null reference exception as if we just heard about it yesterday. This was the death of every code deployment I've known since .NET 1.1. It took them this long to recognize and implement this feature especially when Eric Meijer screams about functional programming since .NET 2.0. Downvote me for all I care, there is no reason this should have waited this long and drum up is anything by lame. If they are serious about offering functional programming style, they better start sweeping like yesterday
I have something similar although I just kinda said the hell with it and it catches NullReferenceExceptions and returns a default(T) instead. Ssshhh.
Why? If it can't be cast it will return null and then he's going to just create a new object.
I think I've got one for you: Introducing Microsoft Visual C# and Visual Studio 2012. I'm enjoying it so far.
Of course Groovy had it first, that is where C# is taking the (?.) from. The author does not act like it is a new problem, just pointing out the annoyance of having to add the extra null checks vs the new syntax. You sound very angry over a piece of syntactical sugar.
The joke is that the Java language has a very slow development cycle. They were beat to the lambda finish line by C++, and C++ did not compromise their syntax like Java did with the special :: member access operator.
You could make a log interface and an implementation that logs to the LogWindow. Inject an instance to this in the constructor of your classes.
It's hard to say without a real example. To me that would imply that the code was casting it to the wrong Type and ignoring the actual value (which presumably would be meaningful data).
VBA...? visual basic right? ye sorry I'm a bit of a noob still :$
I want this now.
Anything in particular?
Thnx to you guys but I have still one problem. I'm now able to copy the text from a doc but can some one help me with pasteing the content
Sure, I edited my original post with a slew of examples.
Yep, provided in the post now.
&gt; So using My.Namespaces as myns. And then reference the class as myns.MyClass. You can alias a namespace. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sf0df423.aspx using myns = My.Namespace;
&gt; Generic Type constraints are half-baked. I can think multiple things I would like to use type constraints for (static duck typing, anyone?), but I can't because they just hacked a few specific constraints into the language. Also this is for some arbitrary reason not allowed: TDelegate GetDelegate&lt;TDelegate&gt;(string functionName) where TInput : Delegate // &lt;- Why doesn't this work? Delegate is a reference type, and all delegates inherits from it. So why can't I add a delegate constraint?
Good points. Agree with pretty much all of them.
Ok, I'll give it another go around and do some more research on using DI to accomplish this. Thanks for the help
Did I say it is? But it has a Java programming feel, allows a full on code import class library from Java (not as reference) ... It is not the same as C# and VB comparison ... It is like comparing MS C# with another vendor C# 
Java has a terrible development lifecycle; ever heard of swings? IIS vs vendor specific Tomcat? Sun Java vs 15,000 other JVM platforms and pick on trial &amp; error until it works with your code? Moving x86 code to x64 with backwards compatibility nightmare? ... Still not sure how slinging poo at Java helps better C# specs cycle. I stand by my comment. As an ISV with millions of lines of code, I expected this in v2.0. Adding now, I could care less
Sugar? debatable .. if you writing code fresh from the ground up, probably. How about if you are an ISV with an existing codebase with over millions of lines of code? I wouldn't use the word sugar. When ISVs were pushed into an adoption cycle, which started aggressive in v2.0 this would have been very beneficial. If this was introduced now, as an ISV, I don't feel the need to go back to clean up existing code for this small feature. This is why it should have made it into v2.0 spec
Visual Basic for Applications - it's built into Word, Excel, Outlook etc. It 'knows' how to do stuff like this. Just go Tools : Macros : Edit and it's there (Alt-F11 may work too).
Groovy 1.0 was released after .NET 2.0...
Not sure how release date is relevant to the conversation? EDIT: clarity
Thank you for the reply. Sorry about that,This is what simonsays.cs looks like as a whole public class SimonSays { private Color[] sequence; private Color [] colors = new Color[]{Color.Red, Color.Green, Color.Blue, Color.Yellow}; public SimonSays () { } public Color [] newSequence (int length) { string line; int counter = 0; Color [] array = new Color[length]; System.IO.StreamReader file = new System.IO.StreamReader("instructions.txt"); while ((line = file.ReadLine()) != null) { array[i] = /* instantiate your new color here, based upon the value on each line */ } file.close(); this.sequence = array; return array; } public void newSequence (Color [] sequence) { this.sequence=sequence; } public int Compare (Color[] user_colors) { if(this.sequence ==null) throw new InvalidStateException("The game engine has not generated sequence yet"); for (int i=0; i&lt;user_colors.Length; i++) { if (user_colors [i] == this.sequence [i]) { //single match } else { //no match return -1; } } //all matched if (user_colors.Length == this.sequence.Length) { return 1; } else { //partial match return 0; } } public Color[] Colors { get { return colors; } } } } 
&gt; Color[] colors = File.ReadAllLines("instructions.txt") &gt; .Select(name =&gt; Color.FromName(name)) &gt; .ToArray(); Thanks for the reply! I get this error though "Error 4 'System.Array' does not contain a definition for 'Select' and no extension method 'Select' accepting a first argument of type 'System.Array' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?"
F# *cough*
`using System.Linq;`
Not an answer: awesome extension. Installed. 
Well, if there is nothing indicating what type of object it actually is, a hard cast is going to throw an exception. So, the options are to hard cast with a try-catch block or as cast with if statements. In this specific example, the alternatives would be to have 3 as casts with 3 if blocks, or a try-catch around 3 hard casts with 2 if blocks. This is much cleaner if you don't know that the values are each not null and you don't know what the types are anyway.
I suppose you could say that it isn't sugar since it is adding a feature that did not exist rather than just making it easier to write. I do agree that this should have been part of C# from the start. 
Following up, it looks like _ is actually advised **against.** just FYI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2005/01/26/361363.aspx Do not use a prefix for member variables (_, m_, s_, etc.). If you want to distinguish between local and member variables you should use “this.” in C# and “Me.” in VB.NET.
I'm embarrassed, I just noticed someone already posted this link!
More detail would be helpful. Is there a button for each textbox which copies the text to the 16th textbox? Maybe give an example of what one of the click events would look like. As MEaster said, the object that initiates the event is sent to the event method but if the sender is a button and the text you need is the textbox beside the button, then the sender object won't help too much.
here is an example of several of the events: private void txtBody_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { txtDicePool.Text = txtBody.Text; } private void txtAgility_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { txtDicePool.Text = txtAgility.Text; } private void txtReaction_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { txtDicePool.Text = txtReaction.Text; } as you can see they all set txtDicePool.Text to the value from another textbox. EDIT: copied the wrong methods, just fixed them. EDIT: formatting
I've read the same about the _ class level prefix as well. I have a love/hate relationship with it myself.
So you are actually clicking on the text box itself? If so, the suggestion MEaster gave will work. private void textBox_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { txtDicePool.Text = ((TextBox)sender).Text; } This can be used for all the textboxes. 
 Or you could always call a function passing it a reference to the text box in question if, later, you need to add more functionality rather than just setting the text, it also allows you to edit the display field from one location rather than duplicating it over many click events. Eg: private void txtReaction_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { AssignValue(txtReaction); } private void AssignValue(TextBox txt) { txtDicePool.Text = txt.Text; }
this is a useless word, it is stripped out of the IL just like comments are
You could still do the casting using the `is` keyword to check the type. private void event_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if( sender is TextBox ) { // Do something. } else if( sender is Button ) { // Do something else. } } I don't why you'd do that over separate handlers, but you can. The `is` keyword would be a good safety check to make sure the sender is the correct type before casting anyway. On the other hand you could also do this: private void txtBody_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { TextBox tb = sender as Textbox; if( tb == null ) return; // Sender is not a TextBox. // Do stuff. }
Thanks I think I will do this because I do plan to add more functionality down the road. 
Stylecop standard is "camelCase" for private fields.
Is there a reason that you prefer unity over autofac or other DI containers?
Still this is incredible amazingly bad style. You could easily write an extension using expression that would add null checks on it's own automatically.
Can't see much dependency injection going on... You seem to access the nhibernate session from a static class, I'd inject it into the DAO classes thru their constructor when you create em in the DAO factory.
The other applications require admin rights too, but they usually demand it at installation. There is no way to install a service without admin rights - that would be a huge security risk. You can request admin rights at runtime, if you program doesn't has it yet. You should google for UAC C#.
For some reason they expect you to be reasonably familiar with the performance counter API, as if you couldn't look it up if you ever need it. Also which .NET class to use to serialize to JSON. Other than that it's a lot of very basic control flow -- ifs, switches, while, do/while. Nothing very exciting really.
Out of curiosity, why get a certification at all? Doesn't really seem like employers care about them.
With the method above, you do have to chain .IfNotNull(lambda) calls together, but every step in the chain is null-safe.
You made 3 postings, each advertisement for this product.
Right. I had a slightly different goal.
I think they create a task that runs at logon time (chrome), or put them in the startup folder. A lot of them don't run as a real Windows Service.
Why would people not use newtonsoft json?! There is a built in .net json serializor? 
Oh I see, guess I have to check out the performance counter API then, thanks! Don't think the books write that much about it. But I'm a happy guy if it's mostly on the basic flow as you say. 
Mostly for fun, the certification is pretty broad so I try out/read up on some stuff that I normally don't use. But also because my work like us to take new certifications and they pay for them so no reason not to take them (except the time it take to study). 
My employer is requiring it. Oh well, at least they are paying for it.
Yes there is, and about all you need to know is that the thing is called [JavaScriptSerializer]( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.aspx).
Having X number of certified employees allows a company to become microsoft gold or silver partner, which includes MSDN descriptions, which can be cheaper than buying separate VS 2013 Ultimate Biz Enterprise Premium Cloud Big Data licenses.
There is also [DataContractJsonSerializer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.json.datacontractjsonserializer.aspx), but then you need DataContract and DataMember attributes in your class. 
Also, check out the library Topshelf for simplifying Windows service development. It's awesome and I have used it on numerous projects.
I would say that as long as you're using the wrapper class in the spirit of the [façade pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) there is nothing inherently wrong with this approach. I would suggest that the façade class use interfaces representing the contained classes rather than concrete instances of the contained classes so as to facilitate unit testing and the [open/closed principal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
So what does this offer over Xamarin?
looks like a one time charge instead of annual subscription
Hey I did some more reading and restructured my Session-per-Request implementation. Now I'm injecting Session into my ManagerFactory with AutoFac and then managing transactions on a per-manager level. Do you think that is better?

You could just add one more shouldISend check, in addition to the timer. Check the chunk size/length/whatever. In high throughput times you will hit the max size and send before the timer becomes relevant, and in low throughput times the opposite will be true.
I'd think perhaps an object with a queue-based data structure and a pointer to an object that implements your chunking strategy. Then you could experiment with different strategies by swapping out different implementations of how you chunk; e.g. by size, by time, urgency, etc.
Oh, and to prevent sending nothing, a min size would be useful.
So if I understand correctly, such a wrapper will be done by the client, considering each of the classes is a seperate api that do not depend on each other. Part of the project is making the UI, so the wrapper will be one of the UI classes.
I setup a sub for feedback: /r/smax and a Facebook brand page: https://www.facebook.com/smaxsports any feedback is welcome. It's a beta so its side load for now.

I used this site for a couple of years, around 7 years ago when the company I worked for bought a subscription. I was using it mainly for the Dotnetnuke content, which no longer seems to exist. Anyway, overall impression very positive, it was well worth the price at the time.

Have you had a look at [Redemption](http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/home.htm)? I have used at work recently to convert x500 addresses to SMTP EDIT: Using recursion is about the only good way to do it, even if you did use Redemption
Have you looked into pluralsight.com? I've used it for awhile, both personal subscription and work paying for it. No complaints other than I don't have enough time to watch all the courses I would like to watch.
no, I havent.. I'll have a look. Is it like Lynda.com? I have a subscription there, but they only have one c# course and I've done it. I'm looking for material on the ide and forms in particular at this point. Edit: I had a look, wow they have a lot of c# stuff. a little more expensive than Lynda but they have a crapload more.. Not as cheap as learnvisualstudio tho. I may do both. 
It's the C# forum and you didn't tell us about your stack? :D How did you write the application? 
Ok awesome. It seems to be the best option. 
Much if his stuff can be found for free on http://channel9.msdn.com if you have a subscription (you may not need one, I have not tried without logging in). Link to the lesson I am on now: http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners/Creating-and-Calling-Simple-Overloaded-Helper-Methods-10 Hope that helps as well!
yea Ive done that course. There is a whole lot more on his website than what I can find on msdn. Maybe there is some stuff only available with a sub that I cant see. 
True, but for now. I am using what I can get for free and will probably get more into things later when I need access to those. :)
Do you explicitly need Outlook APIs or is it Exchange folders you're looking to read?
You're absolutely right. That's a problem. Talking to my CTO about my architecture -- he says that it's OK for service layers to cross domain boundaries to get work done. So it sounds like I should couple ShareCodeManager and PlaylistManager together? Alternatively, I could move it back to transaction-per-request, but I had a lot of issues with testing (how can I easily test an individual manager method when it relies on transaction stuff from its controller) and, at least at work, I'm aware of some instances where we need to commit a transaction and then start a new one, but I suspect my environment is not going to be as complex.
Good point: The WinRT client uses a classic MVVM pattern for the upper layer. All of the interaction with the web tier is handled by a set of classes that encapsulate the complexity for each area of the app. For example there is a comment manager that under stands the tree structure of the comments and all of the metadata that is needed to make it work. These components are accessed via a unity container. The client interacts with the web tier entirely through JSON via the components previously mentioned. And Facebook of course is used for A&amp;A. No synchronous IO which means heavy use of async/await. The web tier is build with ASP.Net MVC and the JSON API portion is built with ASP .Net Web API controllers. All of which is hosted in Azure. The models used to serialized the JSON are in a portable class library so the same code is shared between the WinRT client and the web tier. The server side of things uses a mix of SQL Azure and Azure Table storage for storing all the data. There are a few backend processes that are hosted as azure worker roles for scoring predictions and posting outcomes of games to Facebook, and for updating line data, and score from a 3rd part service. Each worker role is actually just a .Net Workflow wrapped inside a generic worker role class so creating new worker roles is really easy. Activity tracking is used for Azure WAD logging and the tracking level translates to logging verbosity. 
I'd be happy to answer any specific questions. 
Install it and tell me what you think. The next sport we add could be actual football. :)

1. Add data to buffer to be sent, start timer for x seconds. 2. Whenever new data comes in add to the buffer and reset the timer. 3. When adding data if the number of chunks &gt; maxChunksBeforeSend, then you send the data. 4. If the timer expires before you reach the max chunks limit, then send what you have. 5. Disable the timer. 6. New data coming in restarts the timer and back to step 1. This way you will be ensuring messages never grow too large, you are never waiting on data that may never come to send existing chunks and you also will not be continuously trying to send nothing.
I can see your reasoning about transactions in the services, but it makes it harder to make mistakes if you have an ambient transaction around an entire controller action call. i think it's all about writing flexible code, having external transaction scope gives you flexibility/reusability (e.g. you now need to create a new service just to manage the transaction differently, if the transaction was deal with externally then you wouldn't have to worry about it until you come to a case where you want &gt;1 transaction) - the common argument against this that I've heard is that you want to be sure the transaction commits in case something wasn't valid.. (i dislike this, you should be able to rely on the domain code for enforcing validity, if the transaction fails to commit for reasons other than a changeconflict or timeout then their isn't much you can do to recover from it.) 
I had a similar issue with updating a progress bar, the progress update events were too fast and were eating away at the UI thread. This wasn't batching, but rather sending only the newest update, but same idea. My event batcher/folder: * Store the time last update was sent * When receiving update, check if enough time passed from last event, if yes, pass it along right away * If not enough time, hold on to item and start timer for the time the next update should go out * If you receive any new updates, replace stored item with received one (or queue up, in your case) * When you send out an update, don't forget to update last-sent timestamp and deal with the timer
I haven't tried it, but I'm told [SignalR](http://signalr.net/) is the hotness for this right now.
I am using SignalR to push the data to Clients in realtime but it doesn't help with making the transition from historical(queried from database) to the real time stream.
I'm going to try out transaction-per-request and see if I hit any kinks with it. It'll allow me to enable lazy loading, too!
What's the difference between a real-time data stream, or a stream coming from your database a few milliseconds after you write to it? It seems like an easier and cleaner solution to just raise an event every time you perform a write operation and broadcast the latest data. 
There is a really good book about [Dependency Injection in .NET](http://www.amazon.com/Dependency-Injection-NET-Mark-Seemann/dp/1935182501/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393801663&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dependency+injection) In regards how to use DI with NHibernate, there is a good article describing just that: [Dependency Injection and Unit Of Work using Castle Windsor and NHibernate](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/543810/Dependency-Injection-and-Unit-Of-Work-using-Castle) 
That is what I am doing after a write to the database I broadcast the data to all the clients through a delegate. The problem I am is having is when I client first subscribes I must query the past data from the database then register the client for the broadcast. There is a short time between querying the data and registering the client for broadcast that some data may be added to the database and not sent to the client. To solve this I would do the following: 1. Add the client to the broadcast event 2. Buffer data from broadcast event 3. Query past data from database from before the first piece of data from broadcast event 4. Send past data 5. Start sending buffered data from broadcast event This allows me to ensure the client gets all the data in the correct order and doesn't miss anything. This solution though has some problems after the past data is sent and the buffered data, the buffered data is no longer needed. I can't figure out a good way to switch off the buffered data into a direct call. Also because I have to buffer the data I am also creating a separate task to get the data from the buffer and send it when the past data is sent. Essentially I am creating a different task for each client. A separate buffer and task for each client is a lot of wasted resources. I am looking for a better way to do the above. 
I want the client to just subscribe to the service and then have the server push all the data from beginning to current and then real time from that point on.
you should never, ever, output anything via `console.log` in production applications.
Well The amazon SNS might work for you then, your client registers an enpoint with the service and you send it data in xml or json format. So you just start firing off messages from the beginning of your data store and keep sending messages as you get new data. Not elegant but it can work, I'm using it for live data, activity monitoring, at the moment. All you really need is to be able to send a user data immediately. Don't stress about the historical data as once you can send a user data you can just script it to send the historical data and continue on as new records are added to you database. You could probably do most of the work in TSQL like.
This is a scenario I've recently had to solve. My solution was to connect to SignalR, begin receiving updates, and then do the request for the historical. While this is running, continue to receive updates but don't process them yet. When the historical query completes, I merge the result with the updates I'd received in the interim. Would this work for your scenario too?
How are you merging the result with the updates?
 That is what I am doing the problem I am having is the transition of the historical to real time and the buffering of the realtime while I am doing the query.
Thanks for sharing! 2 questions come to mind when you say MVVM pattern for RT are you referring to XAML or one of those web/mobile js frameworks like Durandal? Also what exactly are workflows? When I looked it up on MSDN the description was also fairly vague. It looks like some sort of visual system for arranging code. I see you use it for something called a worker role which is also a new term for me. Considering your usage as backend processes would it be right to consider them as sort of a composed application that runs on a schedule like a cron job or am I way off? edit :clarity
Yeah this is essentially how I am doing it now the part I am having trouble with is the small time frame between the buffered results being sent after the historical records and the direct stream. Maybe I am over thinking it I just don't want to lose any data and I want to make it as efficient as possible. Below is some basic code that I am using to implement what I have been talking about. My problem is that eventually I don't want to have to use the buffer and would rather the task I spun off ended eventually when I don't need it. The code below works but if the data comes in faster than I can send it or even slight close then the buffer never empties out and I can never get rid of the SendBuffer Task. Also I am wondering if in general there is a better way to implement this. bool pastSent = false; void SendRealTimeData(data) { if(buffer.Count == 0 &amp;&amp; pastSent){ SendData(data); }else{ buffer.add(data); } } void SendBuffer(){ while(!buffer.IsComplete){ var data = buffer.take(); SendData(data); } } void SendHistorical(){ IEnumerable&lt;data&gt; pastData = db.query(); foreach(data in pastData){ SendData(data); } pastSent = true; Task.Factory.StartNew(SendBuffer); } void Subscribe(){ RegisterRealTime(SendRealTimeData); SendHistorical(); } 
Who does that?
Pluralsight is amazing. Very high quality videos. For free look into Microsoft's virtual academy and channel9
OK - New question, same topic: &gt; foreach (Folder folder in ns.Folders) { GetFolders(folder); } The GetFolders function is &gt;public void What return type do I use to return an outlook folder that can be iterated for email items? Thanks - Pavilion 
If you subscribe first, then pull historical data second, then anything that gets added to the historical data while the query is being executed shouldn't matter, because it will be pushed to you via your subscription. It would be more likely that you might end up with a duplicate entry - something that you received via subscription just before hitting your historical data query, but that's easily solved with with something like a .Distinct(). Is your historical query *blocking* your ability to receive your subscribed notifications because they're on the same thread? If so, then this is a problem with parallelism - the handling of events from your subscription shouldn't be running on the same thread as your historical data query.
1) The WinRT app was implemented with c# and XAML. MVVM is a pattern Durandal is a JS/HTML implementation of that patter. Xaml goes a long way to help you achieve MVVM so it wasn't too bad. 2) .Net Workflow Foundation is a framework that is ideal of for long running business logic. It has a pluggable system where you can add in persistence for durable workflows and other stuff like tracking. I've used it on and off since 3.0 and I find it very useful. The visual aspect is just one piece and is optional. You can do all of it in code. I used the designer to create declarative workflows. So with my generic worker role I can create an entirely new role by jut specifying a different .XAML file in the config section of the role. I don't know if I'd liken a worker role to a cron job. A woker role is simple some service or process that can do all sorts of things. It can be a WCF service waiting for incoming traffic. In my case one of the roles is polling a 3rd party for data and shredding the XML into SQL, and the other role is calculating the score users receive based on how close they were to the actual outcome of the game. That is all done against Azure Table storage.
I'm just getting up and having my first cigarrette, so excuse if i'm talking out of my ass; but if you can have several releases by the same artist, the relationship shouldn't be &lt;many-to-one name="Artist".../&gt;?
Are you calling save on both releases before flush? or are you calling save and immediately calling flush for each release? I'm a little rusty with nhibernate, but I think you want to call you saves like the following. using (ISession session = SessionFactory.OpenSession ()) { session.Save(release1); session.Save(release2); session.Flush(); } Doing it the way you have it in your code twice will already have written the artist the first time to the database. Doing it the way in the example should know that it is trying to save the same artist twice and know to insert once.
Please don't respond in a global comment. Please click **reply** below each comment and respond directly to this comment. With global comment responses like this it is difficult to see what you refer to, and also the person who gave a comment won't get a notification.
Interesting, thanks for taking the time to explain, especially workflows. It's possible they might help out in some situations I've run into. I'll have to look into them more. 
Do you want to return a single `Folder`? Or do you want to return an enumeration like `IEnumerable&lt;Folder&gt;`? Or perhaps a list of folders like `List&lt;Folder&gt;`? This question sounds like you don't know the basics of C#, in which case you might read about them first.
You're looking for SaveOrUpdate. Also, never use Flush, use transactions. Lots of reference material on this on ayendes blog, nhforge, stack overflow.
You're also going to want to load a reference to your entity second time around and modify that. Highly recommend going through one of the numerous getting started guides, have a sneaking suspicion you're getting nh's concepts wrong.
Sounds awfully close to what you might run into when making an IRC bouncer. Reminds me of continuing mine to make a good WP client that doesn't fuck up every time you put the lock screen on.
Why not? I've seen quite a few things where there's console output in what I'd call production. (genuine question)
I remember seeing a post that the new version isn't free though.
Few questions: * I assume you want it to be a two player experience, rather than against a computer driven opponent? * How are you hoping to do 'graphics'? Is it going to be console based, WinForms, WPF etc? * When you say it must be done by Friday, why? 
I've had the same questions, Coding standard board games is just about encapsulating all the rules. I think if you do some googling you would find some examples.
 I would probably use a dictionary to handle the board squares, and have a class set up for each chess piece that counts out each square that piece moves. For tougher moves like the bishop you'll probably wont to go up one over one up one over one etc, but for pieces like a knight you'll want to have it go forward forward forward then left left. You'll also want a class setup for the general chess rules. It sounds like a fun project, are you coding it just from scratch or are you allowed to use a game engine like unity?
This actually sounds like school work.
well yeah of course. Doesn't mean it cant be a fun project though, thats why I asked if they were allowed to use a game engine.
How did you get the Artist for the second release you saved? It looks like NHibernate thinks it's a new Artist that just happens to have the same name as the first one. You need to make sure NHibernate knows it's the very same artist - that already exists in the database.
In my case, I am storing the data anyway. I have data being put into a database for reporting purposes, which my service can also use to get the 'current' data. The same data is also being pushed via SignalR so the process of connecting, receiving pushes, and merging current data is all very natural. It may not be a perfect fit for your scenario however.
Why choose a dictionary over a 2 dimensional array? Are you thinking to store the locations in the letter-number pair notation?
pluralsight.com not plural*site*.
Sure: var foo = aPossiblyNullObject.IfNotNull(x =&gt; x.SomeProperty); Instead of: var foo = aPossiblyNullObject == null ? null : aPossiblyNullObject.SomeProperty; You could also chain it like so: var foo = aPossiblyNullObject.IfNotNull(x =&gt; x.Bar).IfNotNull(x =&gt; x.Baz).IfNotNull(x =&gt; x.Foo);
ServiceStack.Text should still be completely free. The project is still open source so you can download the source and build your own binaries. The new version has licensing arrangements for Nuget and customer support. The Nuget binaries are free up until a certain number of service methods if you actually use the web service portion of the framework.
This would work for 'DBNull' as well such as for DataView Objects? Of course I'm going to experiment with it as well to to learn to use this. But thank you.
Yes, that is the problem. Artists also had a Guid field (I thought this wasn't relevant) and removing that definitely helped. Still need to call session.clear(); after every saving but at least it works as it's supposed to. I'll try to fix that.
I was looking for a way to "store" objects and NHibernate popped up a couple of times when I googled. I gave it a try and it was great. Well, until I ran into this problem ;)
The second Save call is where an exception is thrown, so Flush wouldn't be executed.
I though it was, since an Artist object is used by "many" other Release objects.
It's terribly bad practice. `console.log` amounts to leaving debugging code in production. It serves absolutely no use to the end-user, and outputting it takes precious milliseconds of time that would be better spent not sending output to a window only a developer should see. On top of this, older browsers (IE7 for example) will crap its pants if you leave `console.log` in without special handling for the `console` object. If you use newer console commands `console.group`, for example, even IE8 can break.
Not sure if serious, but you did. Click any of your links and it dumps a bunch of crap to console.
Do you have an example link for a repro? Don't see it myself. Browser version would be good too. 
Hi, With a deadline so short, I think you have to stick with two players game anyway. First advice: don't put too much time in UI. You'll have an in-memory representation of a board, and just refresh the UI to reflect that after a move. You can go fancy if you have some time left, but getting the rules right is not that easy. Then: choose a representation that allows easy validity checks. Be pragmatic and don't try some complicated object mess. Some hints for that: most processors are now 64bits, and a board is 8*8... (the keyword bitboard in google can be helpful there) The number of moves for each piece over the board is finite, so it's in-memory cost is constant, so there is nothing wrong in hardcode all the thing... Remember that validity for some of the moves can only be validated by checking possible moves for the next player after the current move have been played. Also remember that you must have some counters for special action that can only be executed once, or which becomes unavailale after a check... I've had this assignment, for my first contact with WPF, so I know that a two-players chess implementing all the rules and able to display possible moves on hover on the pieces, is doable on a week, but I also know that the harder part is the rule engine. (I still have the code I produced somewhere I guess, but that would be cheating :p )
Click the link you posted, open dev console, click a top-level link on your page. I'm using Chrome-latest. 
Ahh, ok. Thanks for the clarification.
Not that that would matter if you're using HTML 5 ... Anything below 10 fucks that up anyways :D
No problem. I actually stumbled across ServiceStack.Text in a stack overflow post discussing JSON Serialzation benchmarks. I used ServiceStack.Text as a System.Json replacement in an MVC3 web app. Eventually I started looking into them as a complete replacement for using WCF for a rest api. Now I've fully drunk the Koolaid and I am using the framework as much as I can. I recently made http://demo.preggopredict.com using ServiceStack as my backend api and AngularJs for the front end.
yeah I was thinking of setting the dictionary references to the letter number location of a square on the board then set the variable each reference holds to the game piece that is on it.
one benefit of DI is to aid aplying cross cutting code. for example, your PlaylistItemManager has a bit of an SRP violation as it also does logging internally. you can now implement a LoggingPlaylistItemManager that also implements IPlaylistItemManager and takes a regular PlaylistItemManager and logger in its constructor. and pass this into constructors that need IPlaylistItemManager. - note that you could also do that with inheritance, but you should generally prefer composition over inheritance imo...
I found this article on AutoMapper two-way mappings: http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2009/09/18/the-case-for-two-way-mapping-in-automapper/ I've gone ahead and removed my ReverseMaps. Now, the Domain's static Create method accepts a DTO entity as well as necessary IManager entities needed to create itself. This allows me to not have to reference DependencyResolver anywhere outside of test cases which sounds great to me. Some of my test cases still don't pass, but I really should get some work done at my actual job instead of fussing with this architecture all day. Oh well. :)
What if you change your mappings such that you are adding releases to an artist vs adding releases that link to artists? How are you setting the Artist property on the releases? The comment about SaveOrUpdate is also on point, because if you just call Save it will assume it needs to create a new entity. Even if you use SaveOrUpdate and you don't have an identifier on the entity and you didn't grab the entity through the session, just saying Release.Artist = new Artist { Name = "Bob Marley" } will cause the same issue. If you are looking for "simple persistence" and aren't opposed to using Microsoft frameworks, Entity Framework is probably a lot easier to get started for beginners than nHibernate. Also it's code first and migration stuff is pretty cool. Also the tutorials/documentation on it are pretty solid and there is more up-to-date info out there than nHibernate.
Depends if you have backwards support or not. Most industry applications have backwards support requirements to 8. Some places still do IE7. It sucks, but the reality is that it's a large browser share still, especially in any industry dealing with money, health, or insurance.
I want to return a single folder, so (you're right) I have to go learn about IEnumerable&lt;Folder&gt;. Yes - C# is new to me. I've programmed in other languages, php, jQuery, VBA, etc... but not C#. So although I am familiar with overall concepts, I can get "lost in the details" on C#.
Well, I'm talking about personal projects or other stuff where you don't have to care for IE&lt;10
Indeed, you went too far down the comments haha I see why it's useless, was just wondering if there's any other reason. If they were to look at my github I'd say that they are looking at the dev branch haha 
Other than the reasons I already stated, no :)
On it (y)
I don't do WPF or mobile dev, but a stack trace might help. Also, maybe it should be moved out of the constructor for the window? Perhaps in an OnLoad (or analogous for WPF)?
Strings can be arrays of characters and arrays of characters can be sorted. 
Ive tried using some kinda of array i found online but it dident work, the "user" of the program couldent input any text which resulted in that only me the "creator" of the program could input information to become backwards, ill keep reading, if anyone knows any good article or so, feel free to link it, and thx Bookon for your answer
 var line = Console.ReadLine(); var sArray = line.ToCharArray(); Array.Reverse(sArray); Console.WriteLine(sArray);
&gt; var line = Console.ReadLine(); &gt; var sArray = line.ToCharArray(); &gt; Array.Reverse(sArray); &gt; Console.WriteLine(sArray); This was the solution we were searching for, thank you very much and god bless you! :D 
Try this: Console.WriteLine(string.Concat(Enumerable.Reverse("This is a test"))); 
Nice, I didn't know that there was a method for that :-) To OP: what this does is just swap all the items around. Think two indexers, one counting up (as per default) one counting down. int i = 0; int j = inputString.Length - 1; Now you can loop over the characters in your string, and take the char that is at the position of the second indexer, and put it in a new array at the position of the first indexer. newArray[j] = inputString[i]; That new array can be declared as such: var newArray = new char[inputString.Length]; Using some for() loop magic, I get this (working) code: var inputString = Console.ReadLine(); var newArray = new char[inputString.Length]; for(int i = 0, j = inputString.Length - 1; i &lt; inputString.Length; i++, j--) { newArray[j] = inputString[i]; } var outputString = new string(newArray); Console.WriteLine(outputString);
Perhaps you should purchase some advertising. This is not the place to hock your wares. I would imagine this will get deleted soon..
Please not. This works, but it's a really bad solution.
**Please don't give out code for an obvious homework problem.** Yes there is a reverse function however, you are **cheating them** of learning the basic skills of using a for loop and counting down. There isn't always going to be a function for what they want and they will have to learn to program on their own. These small problems are designed to help them in the long run, if they can't master these then they will not be equipped to solve real problems later on.
Great that this contains unit tests! Too many articles are missing these.
You definitely don't need WCF. As for DB access, I don't do mobile dev, but I can't imagine why best practices would be different from any other environment.
Sweet, KO bindings intelisense...
This is by far the best answer
Hi, No problem, this was really first place where we promoted control. Maybe some feedback was helpful, but if is required - admin may delete post. Thanks for leaving it for at least 1 day. Bojan 
Either a mobile app or a web app. I need to figure out which would be the most economical way to go. Although, I would think a web app would be the easiest since I wouldn't have to code a separate app for each platform.
That is true. I don't see any reason you would need to learn WCF though. If you're doing just a web app that needs to connect to a database, a combination of javascript/html/css for the front end and php and mysql handling all the backend would work just fine. I can't think of any database practice that would differ because it is on a mobile platform
I see. Depending on how much data you were dealing with, it might be worth looking into working with internal storage on the phone so you don't have to deal with a network at all. Just a thought!
The raw text files are 154MB for California state law. I would guess a 10% overhead for encoding and linking; so ~170MB or so. The only thing is that the code might change if new laws are passed or court cases decided. So there would need to be a way to check for changes, too. If I had to hazard a guess, the entire code for all the states, counties and cities would come to ~2.5 to ~3 GB. It could, of course, be way more than that, but even at that size, there's no way I'd expect the user to hold all of it on their phone.
Oh god no. It was just worth a thought if it was under a few megabytes of data, it would allow for a fast and responsive app. 
You can also use a Stack, push each character to the Stack, and then pop the characters (First-In-Last-out).
Is it a retail license or MSDN license? I have my MDSN licenses (for multiple versions of VS) on 3 machines (desktop, VM, and a laptop).
I believe it is MSDN. I go to campus as a CS major and got free keys and downloaded from dreamspark. I thought I could only have one computer per key
I find it interesting to mix Nancy and EF. That would of never occurred to me to try. As a beginner, I'm torn on tuts that incorporate all the best practices when its not a best practice tutorial. Not this, but some spend so much time in the unit test then sprint through the the actual meat of the demo and leave you with a half baked project that doesn't build.
You get as many as you want from dreamspark afaik :)
No I am only privileged to one key per software. That's why it's important to me that this key work on my other computer :)
Imo, the teacher should give a better task too then. One that can't be completed in one line of code.
It doesn't matter. Retail licenses allow you to install on multiple devices too.
Wasn't sure since I've never had one. 
I'm assuming the TextBox was generated by the designer? Designer generated controls are marked private by default. Technically, you could change the access modifier for the control, but a better solution would be to create a public property on the form that exposes only the string, rather than the whole Textbox.
Ahh yes. Thank you! This is exactly what the problem is. How can I create the public property that would expose only the string? Public Property Name As String Public Property Owner As String = Textbox.Text 
I don't know the VB syntax, but in C# you would want something like public string SomeString { get { return textBox1.Text; } }
I've been strongly considering it, but haven't had time. I'd be more than willing to contribute though.
Any ideas for a name? My bot's name is currently [Kiwana](http://github.com/Banane9/Kiwana), at the moment it's pretty flaky though. Kind of stopped in the middle of transitioning the command system. Would you be contributing enough that it'd make sense to have a github organization? As for the name, imo a god-of-chatting's name would be fitting imo.
The bouncer I assume would be on a server or something with a permanent connection to queue up the messages the user has logged on to. What you just need to do is have a check flag as to which message was last seen by the app and on the next GET from the phone app it spools all the messages forward from that point on. And if you make a notification service as well; for that feature you don't spool it to the latest and flush them to the user, just do a COUNT (*) from the flagged message and forwards and let the user know "You have 200 unread messages". 
Don't think GET should be used for the messages. You'll want to send them too, and I believe that a socket/stream would have more security and less overhead. The notification thing and keeping track of the last read messages should be split up for different devices imo. So you would still get all the messages you are missing on your tablet, even if you read some on your phone. And maybe still allow the client to define a range, for reading up logs that were removed on the device, or getting some backlog at the very first connection. Thanks for making me consider those points :)
I'm primarily a C# developer, but I suppose it's something along these lines: Public ReadOnly Property SomeString() As String Get Return textBox1.Text End Get End Property
In addition to architecture and readability, throwing an exception is expensive in terms of performance. The CLR has to do a lot of extra work every time an exception is thrown.
Someone already did this for Android, called TapChat. It may be useful to look at the [code used in their "bouncer" server](https://github.com/codebutler/tapchat) for inspiration.
Yeah, keep in mind - exceptions are slow. Once I had a GridView of like 100 rows, I needed to make an action to every row. I didn't write null check and invalid argument exception separatly because i perforemed same actions both cases. When i had an empty grid, procedure took more then a second just for 100 exception catches, and that worked in a blink of an eye with an "if" check. Even if we are talking of an exceptional situation, if it is likely to occure, it is better to manually check everything, especially inside cycles.
http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1zmrgp/when_should_i_use_exception/
I'd rather see a client for [quassel](http://quassel-irc.org) or [smuxi](http://www.smuxi.org). Basically server software running elsewhere and the client would connect, so you wouldnt have to keep anything running on the phone.
How is it an exceptional situation if it's perfectly normal that a grid would contain empty rows? I think the problem was that an exception was been thrown by a trivial programmer error (not checking for null) and the really bad part was that code was swallowing this exception. Such an exception should be fixed by the developer ASAP (as in at the first empty row). Developer error exceptions should be thrown and caught only by debugger (and if they happen in production, logged and an error message shown). If the application tries to write a file and the disk is full, now that's an exception. In that case it should inform the user it couldn't write the file. 
I agree in principle, but then you have to have a mechanism for preventing them from being null, such as child objects deferring creation to parent objects, wrapping your collection adding mechanisms, etc. If you don't have the architecture in place, you're gonna need some null checks....
That was just an example. There wasnt string.NullOrEmpty check at first just because code was partly-written and when it appeared I was amazed at speed diffference and realised how slow exceptions are.
Exceptions are slow because every time one is created the entire stack trace along with the call stack has to be captured. 
Remember though, that exceptions are thousands of times faster in code compiled in release mode than they are in debug mode. See http://yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/exceptions.html &gt; If you ever get to the point where exceptions are significantly hurting your performance, you have problems in terms of your use of exceptions beyond just the performance.
Try this: _Result = _MainForm.SomeString; That public property SomeString is used to gain access to the private TextBox's Text property from outside classes, because you can't access textBox1 directly. Check out the MSDN article on properties, it's a good read for this particular situation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x9fsa0sw.aspx
There are docs at http://sevenzipsharp.codeplex.com/releases/view/51254
unless you don't fuck up
Listen to this man. This is great advice. 
People still using exceptions to perform routine control flow are not reading these (or any other) articles.
Well my site traffic would argue otherwise but I'm much happier doing it for me. I'll take happy over popular any day! :D
I would actually suggest SharpCompress: http://sharpcompress.codeplex.com/ After that, its relatively easy (7z in this case) var f = SevenZipArchive.Open("file.7z"); foreach(var entry in f.Entries) //Do Something I use this in a few of my projects, and it's been working flawlessly.
Perhaps SignalR is worth looking at for this.
On which type of project? Is that an XNA game, a Windows 8 app, a windows phone app, a WPF or Winforms app?
On my phone so can't get you a detailed answer, but basically instead of incrementing by +1 or - 1... Which implies 45°.. You need to increment by a decimal delta, eg 0.56x and - 1.2y... To find the x delta you could find the distance between the 2 x values and divide by the the number of steps you want to get there in... Effectively the speed,. Then do the same for y... Makes sense? 
If you aren't using xna, I would suggest using xna as the mouse position can be easily captured in the update section and then In the draw function just draw your object with the position vector the same as the mouse, xna runs at 60fps so you won't need to do any fancy gymnastics to get a smooth follow.
I bookmarked this incredibly useful [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qk3vl/code_i_always_forget_movement/) from a few months ago that seems to be what you're looking for: [Game Dev movement cheat sheet with examples](http://www.somethinghitme.com/2013/11/13/snippets-i-always-forget-movement/) In fact I had forgotten about it until I just read your post now and realized I could use it for a problem I've been struggling with for days now (smoothing my camera movement in a 2D enviroment)
You could do this with some trigonometry - the line you want to take in conjunction with the distance on the x and y axes form a right angle triangle which means you can use [sohcatoa](http://www.mathwords.com/s/sohcahtoa.htm) to calculate the correct angles and distances. Or you could say the total distance you want to travel is the *root of the* sum of the square of the x and y distances, find the proportion of that distance you want to travel per tick, and multiply it by the x and y distances. ie: const double stepSize = 2D; double x = _xClick - _x; double y = _yClick - _y; double displacement = Math.Sqrt(x * x + y * y); double proportion = Math.Min(stepSize / displacement, 1D); // use min to make sure we don't overshoot _x += proportion * x; _y += proportion * y; I think that basically works, but you'll need to add some logic to handle negative directions. Edited for missed detail.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Versions
They (?., etc) aren't out yet so you probably won't find much information on them yet. Like you found, the MSDN Blog usually has new features, just search for new features in c# (version). 5.0 is the latest. This has some of the possible changes in 6: http://damieng.com/blog/2013/12/09/probable-c-6-0-features-illustrated
There is no C# version 4.5 - the newest one is C#5, before that was C#4. There are suggested features for C#6, but none confirmed. The ?. operator is very likely.
My first thought is a bubble sort using files instead of an array. 
Read the numbers in the 1st file, keeping track of the smallest one. Read the 1st file again, removing all instances of that number while writing them to the 2nd file. So if the smallest number is "2" and it occurs 3 times, the 1st file will end up containing 17 numbers all greater than 2 and the 2nd file containing "2, 2, 2". Repeat until 1st file is empty. There's probably a more elegant way of doing it, but this should work. 
Since this is probably homework I won't write the code for you, but I'll show you how to look at the problem. Think of how you would do something like this: // Our list of numbers source.txt // A list of files you'll create corresponding to the numbers in source.txt 01.txt ... XX.txt // The result set created based on the number files in existence result.txt It is important that the number files have leading zeroes. That will allow alphanumeric sorting to correspond with numeric sorting. The commands to do all of this are fairly basic and shouldn't take you long to figure out. [Edit] I would probably recommend that the number files have a different extension than your source file. That will make generating result.txt easier.
Arrays? I think all programmers deserve arrays. I should ask my boss for arrays.
Funny guy.

Basically, it's going to act as a form of authentication before the user actually gets to use the application. I also need some form of error message included; if you could help explain what is what as well, that would be fantastic but not necessary.
&gt;[it's going to act as a form of authentication before the user actually gets to use the application. I also need some form of error message included](http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1zqr9r/c_login_via_arrays/cfw2uki) Well, you've basically just described "login system". ---- We need more details because there's about 8 billion different ways to interpret or code "authentication using arrays". The information you've given us (so far) is like walking into the post office and saying "I need to ship a package", but not having any details about the contents, size, weight, or destination. What are your *actual* requirements? * How is the username / password getting to the console app? Command line parameters? Separate file? User credentials? Web call? * What is required to 'approve' a login? What is required to 'disapprove' it? Are you validating against a password? Or user permissions? Or application permissions? Or a web call? Or the time of day? Or whether a different application is running? * What is your thought behind "using arrays"? What do the arrays contain? What do you expect them to return?
Our 'teacher' seriously wants us to include the username and password inside an array, in the application. I assume I use a loop then to check if username/password is correct do this, else do this?
&gt;Or user permissions? Or application permissions? that would be "authorization". the OP is only asking for a "form of authentication"
Well to make is simple, but not do homework for you. Below is a basic if statement to check if login is equal to what is set in the system, in this case foo, bar. In this case it doesn't matter what is username and what is password, only their location in the array matters &gt; if(credentials[0] == "foo" &amp;&amp; credentials[1] == "bar"){ &gt; return true; &gt; } &gt; &gt; return false; &gt; } This is how you use it. Basically you are creating an array that is 2 strings long, assigning foo to array position 0 (remember arrays are 0 indexed) and bar to position 1. &gt;string[] loginInfo = new string[2]; &gt; loginInfo[0] = "foo"; &gt; loginInfo[1] = "bar"; This part check validity, you're calling the validate method from the beggining and passing in the array you created . The validate method in turn passes the array elements to the if statement, which in turn returns bool (true/false) &gt; bool userValidated = ValidateUser(loginInfo); You really should read up on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9b9dty7d.aspx for arrays http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1sx6ed2.aspx Hello World (for using Console) To have an error message you can use Console.WriteLine if it's something like incorrect password How far into the language are you in your class? have you used loops?
in my example, ValidateUser is "public bool" (a publicly-accessible instance method that returns a boolean). If you're in a static method like "static void Main", then you can only call static methods and not instance methods. In that case, you'll have to make ValidateUser a "public static bool" method.
Okay, I understand this. This method is slow but you're right it works. Thanks.
I'm going to give you a route to follow but no code, I really hope you try to implement this yourself 1. create 2 string variables username and password, and give them a value 2. Print a message to the console asking for username 3. Get username input from user and add it to the first position in array 4. Print a message to the console asking for password 5. Get password input from user and add it to the second position in array 6. Use if statement to check username &amp; password, and if true print true, false print "whatever message you want" 7. (Optional but nice) Create a bool variable called isValidated and set it to false, and wrap 2 through 6 in while loop with a condition that isValidated is false. In the if, if the un/pw is correct set isValidated to true
If you wish to see what my task asks for on my assignment, let me know either by replying here or inboxing me. Might give you a better feel of what I'm asking for.
This sounds like the sort of program I used to assign my students in intro to C#. 
Thank you for this, really helpful! I will try to implement it. 
I've gotta give this a go
Unless something big changes, I strongly doubt it. They've slowly but surely killed all DirectX support in C#. Librarys like SharpDX are about your only option.
I'm not familiar with it, but if C# doesn't have DX support, how are xbox games created? Are xbox games not managed code?
There's a good answer for the relevant DirectX11 question [here on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8306147/2757969) from Microsoft game software engineer &amp; blogger Chuck Walbourn. I'm sure the same is true for v12.
That sucks. In Javaland JavaFX 8 will have 3D support though DirectX/OpenGL pipelines. It sucks that we don't have a similar standard managed way of doing this is C# yet.
Interesting. Thanks. I was always under the impression that all xbox games were sandboxed, which kind of necessitates managed code. I wonder where that came from.
I'd jump at the chance to use [external merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting#External_merge_sort). 
Yeah, MS is doing a pretty good job of screwing up C# currently. I hope their new CEO reverses direction on that front. 
&gt;sandboxed, which kind of necessitates managed code Not really - you can do sandboxes in multiple ways. eg a low-privileged user session. Microsoft pre-approve and sign everything that goes onto the Xbox. To be able to submit games requires a lot of time/effort (and for major titles: money). Being found out that your game introduced something to deliberately escape the sandbox would, I imagine, be a Very Bad Thing for any future titles you want released. 
AFAIK XNA Doesn't run MSIL directly on the Xbox - the framework spits out AOT compiled for the Xbox. 
It was hard not to giggle at the code sample. BlobblobBlobBlob. But it looks much simpler than I would have expected
See http://www.alanwood.net/demos/ansi.html - characters in the range 128-159 were not standardized, and all have Unicode representations at other locations. Specifically, you can use 8482 for the trademark character.
Yep! I use blob storage everyday at work. To get a blob repository up and running takes very little time.
That's the information I was looking for, thank you!
Can we find it on NuGet ?
&gt; why ASCII 153 to Char does not work Because 153 is not within ASCII range. What you may be seeing is [unicode character 153 (0x99) &lt;control&gt;](http://unicode-table.com/en/#0099). At least that is what [Convert.ToChar(Int32) suggests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3hkfdkcx%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) I think. edit: I think Encoding.Default.GetString(new byte[] { 153 }) will give you the expected result. edit2: I looked at the ToChar(Int32) function disassembly, and it seems it is just a wrapper around char cast, so it's a completely useless function except that it throws a OverflowException if the value is less than zero or more than ushort.MaxValue. 
This is wrong. C#5 is the version that came with async/await, C#6 will be the next version. This confusing comes from the fact that C#5 was released together with .NET4.5.
forgive maybe a dumb question but is there a difference between void foo(params String[] bar) and void foo(String[] bar) if you were just going to loop through? I looked at the [MSDN for the params keyword reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w5zay9db.aspx) and the example on there made me think of this question. 
Yes there is a difference. The second method takes a string array as parameter. The second takes an infinite amount of string arrays as parameter.
Thanks!
Thank you for clearing that up. Now I feel stupid because I have been telling friends about the .? operator and saying it will be in C#5 :P
that makes a ton of sense. thanks very much
Something like this has worked perfectly for me previously. string[] Files = Directory.GetFiles(foo, "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories); string PathLower; foreach(string path in Files) { pathLower = path.ToLower(); if(Path.HasExtension(PathLower) &amp;&amp; Path.GetExtension(PathLower) == ".rar") { SevenZipArchive.Open(path); } } Uses .ToLower() because files might have extensions with upper case letters.
If I were designing a language, there would be only one (non-subclassable) Exception type. It would take a string message, and have the ability to attach arbitrary metadata to it for the purposes of helping debug the cause of the exception. My reason for this is to discourage using exceptions for *expected* failures. An exception should only be thrown when the program has actually broken for some reason. Any API that can fail in an expected way should have methods that return some sort of failure result without throwing an exception. (for example, it would be nice if C# had a TryOpenFile method)
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb311038.aspx
"Ability to attach arbitrary metadata" is exactly what subclassing lets you do in a strongly typed language. What ways do you expect opening a file to fail in? The assumption is you want to open a file, not a random path that may or may not be a file, or a file that you don't have permission to, or that the underlying filesystem is broken. Those are all exceptional cases, most of the time it succeeds. If you're often dealing with bad paths and broken files, sure write a TryOpenFile helper in your own library, it'll take you like a minute. You can include a File.Exists check in there as well to save yourself an exception if that's your common case.
Read the errors the compiler is giving you.
Thanks for the reply! So Basically this is all I need to do? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b8e79a279d64acca0cc0 Do you know how I would write these values to a textBox?
 textBox.text = value
Ahh man went right over my head. I always over complicate things, thanks. This method only does really short hex code. But what if I have to convert something like this, 7061636b65740d0a?
 Error 1 'string' does not contain a definition for 'HasExtension' and no extension method 'HasExtension' accepting a first argument of type 'string' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) Can you help? I have no clue where I went wrong.

&gt; "Ability to attach arbitrary metadata" is exactly what subclassing lets you do in a strongly typed language. Well, right... What I'm arguing (and feel free to disagree) is that by allowing subclassing (and allowing selectively catching exceptions of a particular type), a programming language is encouraging the use of exceptions in regular control flow. Which IMHO is a bad thing to encourage. So I guess what I'm really arguing is that being able to selectively catch exceptions is bad. Subclassing exceptions seems fine, though not terribly useful if you can't catch an exception of a particular type. &gt; What ways do you expect opening a file to fail in? Any way where the user selects the file to be opened. For example, my program could display a list of files in a directory, the user selects a file to open, but the file has been deleted or opened by another program in between the time when the list was populated and when the user selected the file. I would classify that as an expected failure that the program needs to handle gracefully -- IMHO catching an exception is *not* the proper way to handle any expected failure state, but AFAIK it's currently the only way to handle this failure in C#. The reason that calling File.Exists before File.Open is inadequate is (besides File.Exists not checking access permissions) that there's a potential race condition where a file could be deleted between a call to File.Exists and File.Open. Sure, that race condition is rare, but it's certainly possible. Ideally a TryOpenFile would be an atomic operation. Not that I couldn't write my own TryOpenFile wrapper that catches the exception itself, but this is just an example of a case where you *have* to catch an exception to handle an expected error, which IMHO is bad API design.
Sounds like you used lower case "path" instead of "Path" on the following line: if(Path.HasExtension(PathLower) &amp;&amp; Path.GetExtension(PathLower) == ".rar") { C# is case-sensitive so "path" and "Path" are two different things... in the code example "path" refers to the string (that contains the path to the file) while "Path" refers to the System.IO.Path class: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path(v=vs.110).aspx If you copy the code exactly as demonstrated it should work.
Why are you storing this information in a single array? Use an array of Dictionary objects and sort with a custom comparer.
There are numerous issues with this code. But ask yourself this... What is the actual purpose (as coded) of the variable x. If your answer isn't 'none' look again. The for loop isn't helping you. You will want to convert it to a do-while loop testing the count variable. 
By default, controls which are added to a form are Private, in much the same way you'd declare a private Byte or Integer. However, if you select the list control at design time, you can change the 'Modifiers' property from Private to Public, allowing you to access it from other forms. Edit: I should add that you will need a reference to the instance of Form1, of course.
I'd be interested in knowing this as well. I'm trying to teach my self c# in the off time and have run into the same problem with accessing controls on one form from another. https://github.com/rowej83/CustomerDebt I have a small project on github while learning that basically lets you store debt that people may owe you. You add a person and it will eventually (not complete) let you add bill for that person. It uses SQLite. I have two forms, a MainForm.cs and a CustomerForm.cs form. The customer form is only shown when adding/editting a person. Currently, I access the Main Form from CustomerForm.cs by using a cast below such as: MainForm myMainForm=(MainForm)Application.OpenForms["MainForm"]; which is used in ResetCustomerList( myMainForm); void ResetCustomerList(MainForm myForm){ myForm.loadCustomerList(); } The myForm accesses the MainForm.cs which reloads the listbox in the MainForm. Is this the way I am suppose to do it to access/update a control on MainForm from CustomerForm? I feel like something is not done right even if it works. Shouldn't all the phones be handled in program.cs and most if not all functions are made in program so that any class or form can access it? 
Oh, didn't realize that you were looking for that sort of help. But now I can see you have gotten your answer. Since you are starting with C#, let me give you a word of advise. Read the tool tip provided by intellisense, if you are using Visual Studio. And also make extensive use of the MSDN website. 
why are you using so many forms? In asp.net the entire page is usually within a single form
I'm working on a project similar, and I'm relatively new to C#. I've done it the long way around, but it works for me. Basically (psudocode): using System.IO; List&lt;string&gt; stringList = new List&lt;string&gt;(); (using StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("tempbatch.bat") { writer.WriteLine(@"dir C:\newfolder /s /b"" &gt;&gt; ""temp.txt"""); } (using StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("temp.txt") { while (!(reader.EndOfStream)) { stringList.Add(reader.ReadLine()); } } // then I've removed all the temp files if (System.IO.File.Exists("tempbatch.bat") System.IO.File.Delete("tempbatch.bat"); if (System.IO.File.Exists("temp.txt") System.IO.File.Delete("temp.txt"); now the list has the files and directories within the specified folder. Long way round, as I said but I guess its a way of doing things in a way I'm comfortable with. :) 
Now I'm just wondering which one would be called if you pass four or fewer objects. Eg: `Console.WriteLine("something {0}", myObject);`
Please try formatting your code. But thanks for the help.
I usually pass form instances through method that have InitializeComponent(); inside. &gt;Main form: namespace FormsTalking { public partial class MainForm : Form { //Define second form private SecondForm secondForm = null; public MainForm() { InitializeComponent(); //Create second form and paste this form info secondForm = new SecondForm(this); //Show second form secondForm.Show(); } } } &gt;Second form: namespace FormsTalking { public partial class SecondForm : Form { //Define main form MainForm form1 = null; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Initialize SecondForm /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name="_Form1"&gt;Form1 instance pointer&lt;/param&gt; public SecondForm(MainForm _Form1) { InitializeComponent(); //set Form1 pointer form1 = _Form1; } } } You can access all public things that way via form1 on SecondForm or secondForm on Form1, this also works with WPF. I hope that you can understand what I wrote since my C# thing naming is very bad
Do you know how much you guys pay? Its always hard for me to figure out estimated cost from their calculators..
Good catch. OP Do you know how to debug in visual studio? Put your cursor on a line that you want to debug and then hit "F9". That will create a break point. Now when you run your program (in debug mode of course) it will stop on that line. You can then hover your cursor over any variable and see what's in it. You can hit "F5" to resume execution or "F11" to step to the next line. In the "Immediate Window" you can also type a question mark and the variable name and see what's in it. Example: ?count 0 ?array[count + 1] Doe ?array[count + 4] Susan
 public static string ToHexString(string input) { return input.Select( chr =&gt; Convert.ToInt32(chr) ) .Aggregate(new StringBuilder(), (current, next) =&gt; current.Append(string.Format("{0:X} ", next))) .ToString(); }
would it be better to implement StrinBuilder in this case? EDIT: since strings are immutable and you'd be overwriting them each time? though it probable doesn't matter in this case, so it shouldn't be a big deal. StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder(); foreach (char letter in values) { // Get the integral value of the character. int value = Convert.ToInt32(letter); // Convert the decimal value to a hexadecimal value in string form. builder.Append(String.Format("{0:X} ", value)); } return output.ToString();

Ah I feel dumb now. We did go over your method in class, though I think he wants me to only use an array. I could technically just use an array of objects, right? Thanks so much for the clear and concise reply. I wasn't expecting so many people to help! :)
I usually create a singleton container class to hold what I want to be in the list box. Will save the information to that container class on a button click event, or something. And then have and event on the main form that listens for the form to regain focus and have that event create the singleton instance and populate the list box. People will probably tell you that's a bad way to do it because singletons get shit on a lot but I like it. Helps to keep the two forms decoupled from each other
Edit: it lets you keep that list box private too
Honestly I have no idea. I can ask my boss Monday I suppose.
Does it specify that they need to be on the same page?
There was a lot of complaining with Windows 8 in that they went straight-up DX in C++ for store apps and removed XNA as a viable option. I'm sure they had their reasons but it seems weird to me that they'd drop it after putting a lot of effort into promoting it since it came out.
You could ping your server before sending data or ping periodically to check for connection. If you want to be able to check to see if it's your server or the Internet connection, you can ping a website that is guaranteed to be up at least 99.9% of the time, like Google, if your server fails to respond. This of course will rely on the website/Web service guaranteeing to be live in the future. 
just wrap in a try/catch most calls to remote will throw a connection timeout or not available error. just catch it it and throw out an alert box "No Connection" I think this is the exception you need to catch, but better test to know for sure "System.Net.WebException"
Would anyone mind explaining this line? &gt; string hexOutput = String.Format("{0:X}", value); I'm not understanding why {0:X} converts it to base16. Thanks!
This seems to be the best way to go.
It's a easy mistake to make. Thanks for pointing that out.
&gt; I would stay away from attempting to ping other servers, because there's really no reason for it. But that's the only reliable way to check for internet.
You're worried about the user's connection to your servers and not anybody else's. If the user can't connect to your servers then it doesn't really matter if they have internet or not. Sure, upon an actual failure to connect to your servers you could feasibly try to ping a known reliable server to offer a better error message, but you generally want to avoid relying on pinging other servers. You can potentially run into problems like firewall/proxy settings, availability of the other server, or just the fact that you have no control of those servers accepting connections or returning pings. 
Good point. I misread what you said as "don't ping anything" instead of "don't ping OTHER servers". :-)
It would call the one that matches best, in this case: public static void WriteLine(string format, object arg0);
Ping is blocked through the proxies at work. I cannot ping anywhere, not even 8.8.8.8.
Did you mean to link to something? Or include some text?
I hear where you're coming from. It's generally tough to tell if someone will be good based on a conversation. How about this: I interviewed a guy last week who claimed to have a 7-8 out of 10 on c# knowledge who said to determine if a number was even or odd, you could divide it by 2 and see if there's a remainder. "Great, how do you do that?", I asked. He said divide it see if it's got 0.5 left over. Great... take an example, what is the value of x in this expression: var x = 3 / 2; 1.5, he said. Wrong because it's doing integer division. "well that's not really a real-world thing you'd run into often", he claimed. Really? Any time you calculate what percent of somethings in a list of somethings are something, you have a count / length and you get 0 unless you know to look for that. How can I avoid that problem, I asked. You could typecast them both to "decimals". Fail. I had one guy say to determine if a number was odd you could look at the right-most bit for a "1". Perfect, how do you do that? "well you could convert it into a binary string and see if that last character is a '1'". Fail. And the reason I wouldn't use Convert.ToInt32 to parse a string to an int is that I once stepped in this: char ch = '9'; int i = Convert.ToInt32(ch); i == 57. I know why it's 57, but it's probably not what I meant to do. If that's really what I wanted, I would have said (int)ch casting the char as an int. Anyway, I don't think these are trick questions, these are things I would expect someone who's been hands-on coding for 10 years to know because they've run into this stuff before. As for a delegate vs a loop. Neither is wrong, I just think if you just told me you've been using LINQ for a while and I ask you how to count odd numbers in an array of int's, you should immediately come up with arr.Count(x =&gt; x % 2 == 1); It's simple, fast and obvious. Moreso than int count = 0; for(int i = 0; i &lt; arr.Length; i++) { if (arr[i] % 2 == 1) count++; } Which takes a little more time to see what's it's doing. 
I would send all internet-bound calls through a single common object that can handle drops in connectivity. Find a way to do all that coding in one place and your life will be way easier. That way your entire client application can make all internet related calls to a class like InternetResourceHandler (for example) which surfaces all the necessary APIs. Inside that class, any calls coming from the client app are queued for whatever resource they need. This InternetResourceHandler can then do all the work in terms of waiting for a connection to be made, waiting for the server to respond, handling timeouts and possible resends of the command gracefully, and returning the response to the caller in the client app. All of that should be inside one class of some kind. That way the rest of your application doesn't have to know much of anything about the connectivity status. It just knows if a function call worked or not. And if it doesn't work (return from InternetResourceHandler indicates an error) your client app knows that every effort was made to make it work and something is seriously wrong (no connectivity at all, extremely poor connectivity). EDIT: This may be obvious, but it is essential that any function calls that rely on network resources (even on your own network) cannot be executed from the same thread as you UI or even the main worker thread. It is better practice whenever possible to make these calls asynchronously through a delegate, then handle the response if/when it comes.
This is exactly the type of answer I was looking for, thanks.
Do you have the names of some alternatives to NHibernate?
While I agree that it is a bit unnecessary, it is not stripped out of the IL, it's added in when it is missing. m_foo.bar(); becomes: ldarg.0 // this ldfld "m_foo" // pop from the stack, and load the field belonging to the object found there callvirt "bar" // pop the target and parameters (in this case none) from the stack and invoke the method where "m_foo" and "bar" would actually be the metadata tokens of the field and method.

The actual implementation would be in the indexer property on RouteBuilder. 
When gaining experience in programming: `Quantity over quality.` - Meaning, you should write, write and write. Do projects, do your stuff, learn what works, learn what does not work, learn from success, learn from mistakes. Always reading books, articles, etc. does not make you better, but the actual work experience does.
The point is to not over-analyze, pre-plan and architect everything. If you spend most time on planning, but never get shit done, you're not making any progress.
I'm curious what text adventure you plan to rewrite. Typically there are two parts to a text adventure - the interpreter and the content. Rewriting the content will not help you learn C#, but may help build some logic skills.
The thing that's most effective at helping you learn is anything you will actually do. Doing **something** is better than planning on doing a different thing, and then never actually doing it. Just do. Even if you don't finish it. Start it. Do a little bit every day. Do something that interests you.
Yeah, also blogs and magazines are pretty good but actively seek out challenging reading material if you want to learn. Then practice til your eyes feel funny.
&gt; textBox2.Text = convert(textBox1.Text); Put that in your button click event handler.
So is this what it should like? I'm getting multiple errors that say "Error Expected class, delegate, enum, interface, or struct"? private void button13_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { textBox15.Text = convert(textBox14.Text); } private void textBox14_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { textBox15.Text = convert(textBox14.Text); } public string convert(string input) { char[] values = input.ToCharArray(); string output = ""; foreach (char letter in values) { // Get the integral value of the character. int value = Convert.ToInt32(letter); // Convert the decimal value to a hexadecimal value in string form. output += String.Format("{0:X} ", value); } return output; } 
That's right. Now I'm even more curious what he plans to use and what's available out there.
Where is the error coming up at? That will make it so that the textbox named textBox15 will convert the value of textBox14 whenever textBox14 is updated or button13 is clicked. (Assuming you have the event handlers hooked up to those functions.)
Hi and sorry for my late response.. I have waited to reply because , like I mentioned, I am noobish and have been reading up on delegates since reading your post. Now that I think I have some kind of grasp on the subject, I would love to skype to possibly clear up this and perhaps other small questions. PMing my skype to you now - let me know in PM when you are available. Thanks again.
I was in the same boat as you, and ReSharper was helpful for me. For each of its suggestions, see whether you can learn more about why it gave that suggestion and in what situations the suggestion makes most sense.
I think I'm falling into the web training k-hole. Been watching training videos on Pluralsight, but not sure at what point I 'know enough' to go off and start developing some side projects...
There are a lot of things Resharper does that are bad in certain situations and also affect readability. It's definitely good to learn what it suggests, but, you could also just google a list of those suggestions and learn on your own. It also has some useful things like removing unused styles from XAML and easy renaming of namespaces etc. Just don't depend on it.
Yes. Resharper helps you write clean code and easily keeps track of variables. Also, you type about a third as much as you do without it. DescriptiveVariablesMakeCodeEasierToUnderstand if De&lt;tab&gt; then endif
It says the webpage is unavailable?
I guess it was just an error in bracket placement that brought up a ton of other errors. So it works now, but I thought that this would convert the hexadecimal code to a string in English. For example, 7061636b65740d0a = packet
Im not sure if you are strictly asking about Resharpers ability to suggest code changes (like converting a for loop to a for each). There are definitely times those are useful, but its not always what you want. It is just a suggestion. Resharper also has great refactoring tools. The part that really shines for me though is the navigation. I use it at work and at home and it definitely increases my productivity.
You could make a class with Name and Address properties and have an array of those objects
Just double the length of the array and have { "name1","adressOfName1", ...}, then split them when you access the array.
yeah, there is two ways. You can try googling "Multidimensional arrays" or "nested arrays". Anyway, here the two ways are The first way: string[,] array = new string[2, 2]; array[0,0] = "name1"; array[0,1] = "adressOfName1"; array[1,0] = "name2"; array[1,1] = "adressOfName2"; The second way: string[][] array = new string[2][]; array[0] = new string[2] {"name1", "adressOfName1"}; array[1] = new string[2] {"name2", "adressOfName2"}; For your example I'd probably go for the second one, but it depends on the task.
tl;dr: Yes, its suggestions are useful for learning the language. There are are a few things I find handy: * Pattern suggestion is good for pointing out patters you didn't think of * Auto-fill for try/catch, switch statements, *et al* is handy * Easy to see highlighting of unused variables/namespaces is nice * The create method helper is great for TDD And my list of grievances: * The performance hit was frustrating at first, but I've mostly gotten used to it * It hijacked a lot of VS hotkeys which need to be reconfigured back * It's warnings are occasionally pedantic and irritating, but can be configured out So most of the frustrating things can be removed if you have the patience to configure it (which handily [or not, as the case sometimes is] it offers to do when you use the shortcut/see the message). A lot of the things that made R# great have been implemented in VS versions. Syntax completion has always been there, you've been able to rename symbols and their references since 2010, as well as add, remove, and reorder parameters (check your Refactor menu). It's a good tool, but I'm not sure it's worth the cash out of my own pocket for a license. If I were to get unlazy and track down a tool that did the code generation for switch statements and creating methods that don't yet exist, I doubt I'd ever think about it again. Edited for formatting
oh, no, this one was to convert to hex... you just need to reverse it now to go back to a string From the same site as before: convert a string of hex back to human readable text, needs a space separating them. If your hex is in another format you'll need to split it with some other criteria. public string convert2string(string input) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input)) { return (null); } string[] hexValuesSplit = input.Split(' '); string output = ""; foreach (String hex in hexValuesSplit) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(hex)) { continue; } // Convert the number expressed in base-16 to an integer. int value = Convert.ToInt32(hex, 16); // Get the character corresponding to the integral value. string stringValue = Char.ConvertFromUtf32(value); output += (char)value; } return output; }
As long as the Key (Name) is never repeated.
There are many ways to do what you want, but depends on what you need. One way is to use an array of arrays (ugly): string[][] s = new string[2][] { new string[] {"name1", "addressOfName1"}, new string[]{ "name2", "addressOfName2"} }; s[0][0] == "name1" s[0][1] == "addressOfName1" etc. A better way would be to use a class or struct to hold those properties. class Person { public string Name { get; set; } public string Address { get; set; } } Person[] array = new Person[2]; array[0] = new Person() { Name = "name1", Address = "address1" }; array[1] = new Person() { Name = "name2", Address = "address2" }; Also its often better to use generic List&lt;&gt; rather than an array for dynamic adding/removing: List&lt;Person&gt; array = new List&lt;Person&gt;(); array.Add(new Person() { Name = "name1", Address = "address1" }); array.Add(new Person() { Name = "name2", Address = "address2" }); You could also use a Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; if the names are unique, any other ways, but these are the most common. 
Is this the part I am reversing? int value = Convert.ToInt32(letter); // Convert the decimal value to a hexadecimal value in string form. output += String.Format("{0:X} ", value);
From the same site as before: convert a string of hex back to human readable text, needs a space separating them. If your hex is in another format you'll need to split it with some other criteria. public string convert2string(string input) { string[] hexValuesSplit = input.Split(' '); string output = ""; foreach (String hex in hexValuesSplit) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(hex)) { continue; } // Convert the number expressed in base-16 to an integer. int value = Convert.ToInt32(hex, 16); // Get the character corresponding to the integral value. string stringValue = Char.ConvertFromUtf32(value); output += (char)value; } return output; } Then you would need to change your event handler as well something like: private void textBox2_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { textBox3.Text = convert2string(textBox2.Text); }
So, sounds like for learning purposes, there's no real "must have" features I "need", just more like nice to haves once I get into a bigger project..would that sum it up?
I suggest you change that variable to a var...
Thanks so much! You don't realize how much you have helped me!
There's not really a good measure of enough, so just go for it, and then ask questions along the way. 
Firstly, I _think_ you're using a proportional (non-fixed width) font. You'll want to fix that first or you'll never get them lined up properly. Secondly, any single character output (either the digits 0 through 9, or your special symbols) you'll want to prefix with an additional space to make sure they line up with your double-digit numbers (10 through 99).
.
Any specific examples you can remember?
Pretty much, yeah. At least imo. And I'll reiterate the learning part. I consider myself a pretty advanced C# programmer, and it's showed me a few syntax shortcuts at I hadn't considered. It's absolutely worth the trial, and if you find yourself still learning at the end, it's worth consideration. Doubly so if you're new to LINQ and the object syntax.
I don't have resharper and can still do this... 
Another great feature is the ability to break code into a function automatically. when I find myself packing too much into one function, resharper will create the stub and pass the required variables. It's very nice.
var is banned at work. sigh. 
Resharper usage can be broken up into groups. Navigation, Refactoring, and Templating. Personally, I don't develop without Resharper. * Navigation: insanely helpful. But, each year Visual Studio is integrating in Resharper navigation features, so this has become less valuable over time. * Refactoring: These are optional of course, but it is helpful from time to time. * Templating: There are full files and snippets. Snippets are wonderful, it is nice to be able to type 'prop' and Ctrl-enter and get a property template. Full files are also really nice for setting up default file layouts. That said, if you really want to do templating, you'll probably have to head to T4. Other Features: * Unit Testing: I like Resharpers unit test runner better than the built in one. 
Resharper is pretty nifty tool. Its too bad its not inherently in the Visual Studio IDE by default. However, using a tool like ReSharper can really be a crutch, too. It can make you lazy and too dependent on its features / suggestions. If your goal is to really learn the C# features, then try doing it without any nifty doo-dads or gadgets. However, if that isn't your main concern - use ReSharper!
WHY? Oh god, I'd really hate to always having to write full type names like `IEnumerable&lt;myType&gt;`. Using var at fitting points makes the code so much more expressive and clean!
I brought up all that, and it came down to everyone else not wanting to hover over the expression to know what the type is. Have to go with the group, even if they're 5 years behind everyone else... 
Definitely. It brings you many things from other IDE's and speeds about everything up - apart from the startup time of Visual Studio.
Isn't this just an intellisense feature?
They're stupid. Simply as that. You use var where it's CLEAR what the type is.
the best part is you can also type dvmcetu (the upper case characters) and it will figure out that you want this variable.
method extraction is a standard feature of visual studio
A lot of the refactoring has been integrated into VS as well. prop and ctor exist in 2010+ R# does have a better unit testing framework than basic .net, though. However NCrunch blows them both out of the water.
yup, it is
you can also do this to make it a little more concise: Person[] array = new Person[] { new Person() { Name = "name1", Address = "address1" }, new Person() { Name = "name2", Address = "address2" } }; and then even more concise: var array = new [] { new Person() { Name = "name1", Address = "address1" }, new Person() { Name = "name2", Address = "address2" } }; the same thing works with lists, as long as you replace "[]" with "List&lt;whatever&gt;". There's a similar format for Dictionaries, too.
I built a system that uses drag/drop of objects onto the screen and does all the sql behind the scenes. This works really well for basic reports/querying (we do it from views, so we can also generate reports for them) The trick for us has been how to do joins on more complicated queries and how to do filtering in a way that makes sense to them. We currently have it set up to where you basically create filters like you would write them in sql, which has had mixed reactions from them, as it requires a bit of instruction to get right.
Thanks for sharing!
Sure, I'll convert a thing or two to [AsyncPoco](https://github.com/tmenier/AsyncPoco). You might as well go right to Web API 2, it's not terribly different from Web API 1 but adds a lot of ridiculously helpful things like RouteAttribute (no more registering routes in App_Start, just mark up the ApiControllers). Content negotiation is pretty sweet too.
Woah, cool! I would love to accept any pull request. Also, noted about Web API 2 -- but do I need VS2k13 for it? I wasn't seeing any options for 2 w/ VS2k12 Also, did you see this? Someone has added support for async in NHib, but can't speak for its implementation: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22308260/633438
ReSharper makes visual studio nice! Please stop writing vb.net as well...
Split on spaces and join if possible is an option. P.S.: Your sample run didn't made any visible break.
Why do you think I'm switching to C#...
It's part of the march of intelligent compilers and IDEs. In the old days it was good practice to prefix the type in the variable name, not just because of an ungodly amount of code per method (scope!), but also as declaration was so far away from usage (I have to know how much stack to alloc up front... derp). Now everyone expects intelisense and such, people should use longer variable names, as you aren't typing them by hand, mistakes are immediately obvious. The higher 'hamming distance' makes it easier for humans to not get confused when reading it and spot mistakes. If you've got a situation thanks to implicit cast operators or similar, that allows for the var keyword to be in anyway ambiguous, you've got a really bad design problem that will no doubt bite your ass at some point. If the purpose of the type being returned isn't obvious from the method that instantiates it, then you've got a badly designed method naming convention. You don't need to know the precise type, but you need to know the roll. Given that in *hard* OOD systems you end up with way to many classes to know the names and members of, often knowing the actual type name isn't really useful. *VarianceAtRiskResultSetForIntradayAdjustment* is obviously no more useful than knowing it's the result of a await CalculateVarianceAtRisk(MarketDataSet.Intraday); what is going to be useful, is how the properties and such of that class are named, so that you don't really need to be familiar with that class to understand what it is conceptually doing. If someone thinks that having the expected type is also enough, it bloody well isn't, as it might be something that inherits from that class and has greatly different behaviours. This drawn out explanation hopefully shows why having variable type declarations explicit isn't just noise, extra typing etc. It also detracts from the important part, the instantiation of that type, be it as a result of a method, or the result of the DI/IoC. It gives terrible false confidence.
Fixed the way output should look. 
Have you looked into using [Reporting Services a.k.a SSRS](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms159106.aspx)? There is a tool called [Report Builder](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd220460.aspx) that allows end users to create reports. I have never used it myself though. I've only seen a few videos about it. What we did in a small company I once worked at was provide database views to the users and then let them create their own "reports" in excel using pivot tables. I'd probably try to use an existing solution instead of creating a custom one since this seems like such a common problem.
Yep, split/ join is an option: Split: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b873y76a(v=vs.110).aspx Join: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/57a79xd0(v=vs.110).aspx "Join" is optional, simple concatenation should suffice.
use anonymous types as much as possible, forcing them to accept your use of var :) 
I think what's important in that task is to focus first on creating a proper algorithm. Implementation with help of google/documentation shouldn't be a problem if you know what you want to do. Here's an example solution: int maximumBreakSize = 30; string input = "Hi, my name is Stacy and I like to shop and dress up and go to the movies and hang out with my friends and so much more but I needed to make this sentence long. "; string[] words = input.Split(' '); var result = new List&lt;string&gt;() { words[0] }; foreach (var word in words.Skip(1)) { if (result.Last().Length + word.Length &gt; maximumBreakSize) result.Add(word); else result[result.Count-1] += ' ' + word; }
This helps immensely, thank you so much!
You need to think about your approach to the problem. For each line, I would start at Character 30 and work back until I found a space. Here's one way to do it: public class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { const string Input = "Hi, my name is Stacy and I like to shop and dress up and go to the movies and hang out with my friends and so much more but I needed to make this sentence long."; // It's good practice to use StringBuilder when concatenating strings var output = new StringBuilder(); // These variables will indicate where each line starts and ends within the input string int lineStart = 0; int lineEnd = 0; // Set up a loop to loop through the characters until we reach the end while (lineEnd &lt; Input.Length - 1) { // We'll make the line as long as possible (30 characters) and work backwards lineEnd += 30; // If we're not past the end of the input string... if (lineEnd &lt; Input.Length) { // ...then work backwards until we find a space while (Input[lineEnd] != ' ') { lineEnd--; } } else { // If we are past the end of the string, then the end of the line is equal to the end of the string. lineEnd = Input.Length - 1; } // Now we can use the lineStart and lineEnd variables to copy part of the string to the output output.AppendLine(Input.Substring(lineStart, lineEnd - lineStart)); // The start of the next line is the end of this line, plus a character as we want to skip the space. lineStart = lineEnd + 1; } // Write the output to the console and wait for a key press Console.Write(output.ToString()); Console.ReadKey(); } } It seems a bit longer than the other solutions provided but it will teach you more about program flow (loops, conditionals, etc.) and is a more 'pure' programming solution.
One my favorite resharper features is the intellisense replacement. Especially that it spans all namespaces, so if you forgot a using it still is able to discover what you need and automatically add it, same on pasted code Also it automatically shows all overloads which is nice
Yes. We just have a rule that we use var where it's clear what the type is from the right side of the equation mark.
Have you considered creating a data warehouse (Kimball method) and then putting that data warehouse in a tabular or multidimensional SQL Server Analysis Services cube? This is really the ideal way, in my opinion, to retrieve data (especially aggregate data) from a SQL server environment. I'm a certified and practiced MS Business Intelligence dev so if you have any specific questions about reporting tools available in the MS BI stack, I'd be happy to answer them. If I were in your position, I would research cube connected pivot tables / power pivot and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). The technologies listed in this post all come with most version SQL Server out of the box so you probably already have these tools licensed and they are pretty easy to stand up. Alternatively, if you have a budget to license new tools, I'm a big fan of Tableau as a reporting interface. SSRS is very limited/outdated-feeling in comparison to most state of the art reporting tools.
Okay, cool. I will get that update and see if I can't get converted over to Web API 2 tonight. Not promising I'll find the time, but I'd like to show some commitment to having my code written as best as possible. :) No clue about the micro-ORM stuff yet, but excited to see. I just want my server to be able to handle a heavy load! I didn't think it would be this challenging.. :)
You can do whatever you want bud. As career advice I suggest making the switch. I have never seen a high level job asking for vb.net and I have seen many job positions come by week after week where I live... Its up to you!
resharper isnt just a learning tool, there are so many little things it adds to visual studio that make your life easier, little hints and highlights that make things easier to read / stand out, it has saved me many times from simple little typos that could have easily turned into bugs and the refactoring is awesome and even support intellisense through its own enhanced version inside of string on commonly used things ie. Respone.Redirect("something") will give you intelligent directory intellisense, and the css intellisense is unmatched IMO 
to answer the second question my boss hates my vs setup because he isnt used to the keybindings once you get past the first couple hours hetting used to it is very non hindering, very intuitive in fact 
Yeah. If you do this you can definitely learn some neat things. 
Using StringBuilder in-place: static string SplitString() { const int size = 30; const string input = "Hi, my name is Stacy and I like to shop and dress up and go to the movies and hang out with my friends and so much more but I needed to make this sentence long. "; var sb = new StringBuilder( input ); for (int i = size; i &lt; sb.Length; i += size) { while (sb[i] != ' ') i--; sb[i] = '\n'; } return sb.ToString(); } 
Ive never really used the "yield" keyword and wanted to experiment. It *may* fit here so I gave it a shot. It works, but not sure if it would be beneficial. public static IEnumerable&lt;char&gt; Line(this IEnumerable&lt;char&gt; list, int length = 15) { int printed = 0; StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder(); foreach(char c in list) { word.Append(c); // Dump word? if (c == ' ' || word.Length &gt; length) { if (printed + word.Length - 1 &gt; length || word.Length &gt; length) // skip a single leading space { yield return '\n'; printed = 0; } foreach (char w in word.ToString()) { yield return w; printed++; } word.Clear(); if(printed &gt;= length) { yield return '\n'; printed = 0; } } } // Last word if(printed + word.Length &gt; length) { yield return '\n'; } foreach (char w in word.ToString()) { yield return w; } } Use like this: String test = "Hi, my name is Stacy and I like to shop and dress up and go to the movies and hang out with my friends and so much more but I needed to make this sentence long."; foreach(char c in test.Line(30)) { Console.Write(c); }
I would add that if you do any java development as well, jetbrains makes intellij idea which is an awesome ide. You get the same refactoring tools, and you can set resharper shortcuts to be almost the same. Its the only way I've kept my sanity these past two years. 
This really good for folks who like excel
Don't. Either use something like ssrs, or spend a bit of time writing some user stories around the actual queries people want to run, most often, there are a handful of queries worth building, and that's enough. Its cheaper to hire a human who knows SQL, or send the users on a training course, than to try and solve this problem yourself with a half baked DSL that maps to SQL. Don't do it!
Ctrl+T has saved me hours in aggregate. 
Noted!
I also suggest that OP try SSRS/Report Builder. I have experience with SSRS. Pretty much all you need is proficiency with SQL. The Report Builder is very reminiscent of something from the Microsoft Office suite. You can build many reports quite quickly. Not much of a learning curve and easy to train a person/team for it. Or are the "dumb" users supposed to create the reports themselves (not just run the ones op creates, with their own params)? Because then I'm at a loss of what to suggest to OP...
Yes, this is more of a business analyst's responsibility to determine what users need and then create filterable reports that you can export to Excel. Allowing ad-hoc querying in a production database is overwhelmingly a bad idea, I think, regardless of the technology, but the natural language solution would be a particularly difficult approach. 
 dynamic
I could change the return to something like: return sb.ToString().Replace("\n", "\r\n\"); StringBuilder also has an Insert() method that could be use in this case. There are other problems with it. What if a word is greater than 30 characters? What if there are already carriage returns in the line? It also does not handle special unicode modifier characters. But it should run fast. (credit due: It was inspired by the logic in your solution)
 var userList = new List&lt;User&gt;(); ***How is it in any way ambiguous what type this is?*** Conversely, IList&lt;User&gt; userList = new ReadOnlyList&lt;User&gt;(); Just because ReadOnlyList implements IList, doesn't mean you can use its Insert method without it throwing an exception. This is a rather contrived example, but just knowing a variable's type doesn't necessarily tell you anything about its behaviour.
Where are some resources you can recommend for that type of dad warehousing? I'm thinking of setting something up like this for an application I'm working on. Now that the transactional DB has grown with over a years worth of data, I'm looking to run some standardized queries on it 
It was for me. There were a lot of tricks/things I learned about that I would have never (okay...) thought of myself.
resharper prints money
1. Why are you using Visual C# 2010? The current version is 2013 (two major versions advanced) and there's also a free express version. 2. You don't want an introduction for Visual C# 2010, but for C#. I would really suggest you to buy a proper C# book.
There is `Environment.NewLine`.
1. I've to use it because is the latest compatible version with Windows 7 (OS used at work) and there are no intentions to update to SP1 or 8 (8.1). 2. Ok, can you suggest a proper C# book? 
I know a lot of people love resharper, and it is very impressive, but for me the performance hit was just to much. Slow to start and a massive memory hog. I wrote an extension to replace the very excellent navigation under ctrl-t and there isn't much else I miss. Visual Studio pretty much does everything else with the exception of Find Usages. The much vaunted loop-to-linq suggestion are a poisoned apple in my book. Many of the suggestions do not make the code easier to understand and thus harder to maintain. If you can't write the linq then you shouldn't be using a tool to generate it. 
2013 is 100% compatible with windows 7.
Are you sure isn't W7 with SP1? This is what I found on the [Official MS download page](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40787): &gt; Supported Operating System &gt; &gt; Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2 If it's working on 7 without the SP1 I'll take it, no problem. 
not 100% sure, but I installed win 7 day 1, and never updated to SP1, not sure if it could've installed without my knowledge. Btw, is there a reason you are downloading "Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop" instead of just "Visual Studio Express 2013" ? I would see no benefit in doing so.
I feel the C# documentation is brilliant. I think there is a good of a starting point than any. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/618ayhy6(v=vs.71).aspx
I tried it, my first Application I did 2 days ago is a little form with a dataGrid and a button: it extracts data from my sql server. Ok, using the tutorials I can go somewhere but...I don't even understand in full what I'm doing, basically working on tutorials I feel like a monkey repeating stuff; it's working but I would like to do that understanding everything behind it.
1. I'm not sure if Windows 7 without SP1 is supported, but Windows 7 SP1 is definitely supported. I would encourage your company to upgrade to the free SP1 for security reasons anyway. 2. I'd suggest C# 5 in a nutshell, but this requires you to have prior programming knowledge.
Don't start with forms, data grids and buttons - especially not when you still have to learn the language. Start with console applications! The reason is simple: When you start with forms, you not only have to learn the language and the framework first, you also are immediately busy with learning the graphical stuff which will just confuse you.
Look over in 'Resources' See 'C# Yellow Book' This.
1. I can't do that, there are thousands of machines (we are world wide) and I think that the one/s in charge of this know why they don't wont to update to the SP1 2. I'll look in to that, thank you.
Yes. If not questions will look like "How do I access a textbox on Form2 from Form1" instead of actually learning the language. This question is so common, and I blame the fact that people start with a WinForms project for this.
I'll try to answer some of your more specific questions. Note that these are really more general to .NET and C#, not specifically 2010. * Namespaces are a way to logically organize your code, similar to the physical organization of your files. Because it's a hierarchy, you move from less specific to more specific; classes that are in the same namespace should belong together - have a common purpose. * Some examples: * `System.Text.RegularExpressions` * `System.IO` * `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel` * `MyCompany.MyApp.Utilities.Helpers` * As you can probably see, each of these starts with a very general category and becomes increasingly specific. * In your code, you can always reference things by fully-qualified namespace, such as `System.IO.File`. However, it is more common to add a "using" statement at the top of your code file. For example, `using System.IO;` Once you have referenced a namespace like this, you can use any of the classes in that namespace by name only. However, you need to make sure that there are not any name collisions between your namespaces. If you had a custom class called `File` (which is probably a bad idea) and you had `using` statements for both System.IO and your custom class's namespace, you would get a compiler error because the compiler can't figure out which `File` you intended to use. * It is fairly common for all classes in an assembly to share a common higher-level namespace, and for that namespace to appear in the assembly name. For example, if I had classes from the `MyCompany.MyApp.Utilities.Helpers` and `MyCompany.MyApp.Utilities.Validation` namespaces in the same assembly, my assembly would probably be `MyCompany.MyApp.Utilities.dll`. This isn't really required, but is helpful for maintaining it six months down the road when you've completely forgotten the details of what you put where. * The identifiers "public" and "partial" have two very different purposes. * 'public' is an access identifier - is other code able to access this class and its members, and from where? At a high level of generalization, access identifiers are: * public - can be accessed from anywhere * protected - can only be accessed within the containing class or descendant classes (inheritance) * private - can only be accessed within the containing class * internal - can be accessed anywhere within the same assembly (or friend assemblies, which is an advanced topic that isn't used very commonly) This one is somewhat of a special case - by default, it basically means "public within this assembly". However, you can also combine it with "protected" - normally, protected members can be accessed from an inheriting class in any assembly, but a protected internal item can only be accessed by inheritors within the same assembly. * Access modifiers are hierarchical - if something at a lower level is public, it is still constrained by the access modifiers of its higher-level parents. For example, if you create a class that is internal, its public members cannot be accessed outside the assembly even though they're public. * 'partial' means that members of the class can be stored in separate physical files, which are combined together at compile time into a single class. A common use case for this is generated code - you can have part of a class that is generated, and also have custom methods or properties without fear of losing them when the generator is run again. Note that all pieces of the partial class still have to be within the same assembly.
If you have some experience in programming and just want someone to simply explain what specific things mean, go with that book. It will explain basic stuff you will need to do your projects and also gives you an example code with it. There are lots of practical tips on when and how to use those specific things. Good luck
Now I know which book I need: yours! 
1. I think that it would be not standard then (company wise), I'm not the lead sysadmin and can't talk for him though. 2. Thanks, I'll take a peek.
I've experience in VBA, long time ago with PHP and Javascript.
I was expecting that and here's why, this time, I want the theory before.
no point writing List&lt;thing&lt;string&gt;,thing2&lt;int&gt;&gt; thisthing = new List&lt;thing&lt;string&gt;,thing2&lt;int&gt;&gt;(); when var thisthing = new List&lt;thing&lt;string&gt;,thing2&lt;int&gt;&gt;(); will do!
I'm aware of SSRS and have used it to create report in the past, but they're not using it for anything with this project. Reports are currently sent to Excel or PDF and are simple tabular reports. I will look into SSRS's report builder capabilities to see if it's something we can use. Thanks!
I started learning C# 5 months ago and totally recommend the video series on msdn from the sidebar http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners Short, extremely clear, easy to follow. I also recommend head first C# as a great beginner book with the right amount of "theory" through real life analogies and easy tutorials to practice what you're learning. A lot of people dislike the book because of the font type and "goofy" presentation on some pages but I wouldn't let that get in your way.
Well here is a basic question do you know how OAuth works in principal? If not first read this http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg Second where are you getting the Tumblr APIs? Are you trying to use their REST Api (HTTP)? or are you getting something from NuGet?
&gt;do you know how OAuth works in principal? Nope. I shall read that. &gt;where are you getting the Tumblr APIs I searched google and downloaded Tumblr# and TumblrAPI from Codeplex, but I couldn't deal with them. What is the REST Api?
OK try this https://tumblrsharp.codeplex.com/documentation To add this right click on your solution, go to Add Nuget Packages, online tab, and search for tumblrsharp, click add Each file you use it in must reference it. Basically you need to add on top "using tumblrsharp"
I am guessing I will have to install Nuget Package Manager?
No, use NuGet, you don't need to deal with manually building them, unless you need to change something
Are you using Visual Studio? 
Yeah. I'm using Visual Studio 2012. I should get NuGet from Codeplex or? Edit: Okay I got NuGet.exe if that's the thing. But when I start it it shuts down immediatly. Is something wrong or am I just stupid and doing something wrong?
you can also try going to tools and manage nuget packages 
you cant use it as a standalone only within visual studio
http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/#?fbid=X4yH1UDAUmz Very good resource which has everything you need from Visual Studio specific up to C# begginner &amp; Advanced, etc I would do C# Beginner first, then DeepDive, then visual studio classes oh, and it's free
Try [this OAuth2 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OAuth2/) by opening the NuGet Package Manager Console and typing this command `Install-Package OAuth2`. You must have a project opened for this package to install. 
The NuGet package manager is already part of Visual Studio 2012 and 2013.
How stable is this? I've been looking for a pure .Net mergurial library so that I can, essentially, version-control a "saved game" folder for a game I'm writing.
Thanks. The other problem, however, is that I have no idea how to actually use it. Any good tutorials/reads out there? Or will you be able to explain?
That was useful thank you. I did it.
1. Iterate over first dimension 2. Iterator over next dimension 3. Repeat for each dimension 4. Write value 5. Write separator Done. What's the problem you're facing?
Since you have provided as little information about what you have tried or any specifics. I have provided as little code as possible and no explanation: // does not support 12-dimensions File.WriteAllLines("array.txt", arr.Select(a =&gt; string.Join(",", a)));
Nice one! Thank you!
I'll look in to that too.
Yes. I get it. But in a commercial shop it's more important that the code fits the style adopted by the group so that its more easily maintained. I would *love* to use var. But it isn't going to happen until everyone else gets fed up with 30- character long type declarations. :( 
VBA and VB.Net has some common syntax, and VB.Net and C# has common functionality (.Net framework). You might want to consider learning VB.Net first and use it as a stepping-stone to understanding C# syntax. *Please Don't* keep using VB forever though. It is just opinion, but C syntax is so much cleaner and easier to understand.
Also, [here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65) is a great reason to be using VS2013, especially in your case.
Your game is GPL licensed?
The hell, that's nice!
Aaaand.... this is why I personally dislike GPL licenses. I would be happy to try out the library and contribute back any fixes or improvements I make, but since I can't use it in my game, I won't be improving the library. Hmmph. :-( Anyway, thanks for the heads-up about the license.

Perhaps he does not know which separator to use?
When it comes to tutorials and things of that nature, think of it more as a guide. The key is to experiment! I grantee you won't crash the computer or accidentally launch a nuke.
doesn't matter if I use that or even specifying the full path (`/entry/author/name`), it always returns null for some reason
I can't download your URL to see the XML but one thing to check for is namespaces. Otherwise post a short XML sample.

I don't know if [this](http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=mvc4-building) might help you, but it will be of some help nonetheless. Look under the Controllers in MVC4 heading. There is a short video on Routes and Controllers. It should help you better understand the routing issue.
I think there are pluralsight videos for MVC5. I'll check out your suggestion tomorrow. Thanks!
Routing hasn't changed a whole lot from 4 to 5. So it should mostly be the same.
Yes, [it seems so](http://www.asp.net/visual-studio/overview/2013/release-notes#TOC10).

It is _very_ stable: HgLab ( http://hglabhq.com ) uses it internally and several big companies are already using it without any problems whasoever.
`xd.SelectSingleNode(node, nsmgr)` worked fine
This is pretty incredible, and the fact that it's released under the Apache license is the icing on the cake.
Have you tried //*[local-name()='author']/[local-name()='name'] ?
What kind of stuff can you build with this? Is there a dependency on sony services or any other kind of sony buy-in to use the API as-is?
Hey, I've managed to get everything going in Web API 2.0. I've got a few concerns, mostly regarding me breaking away from RESTful practices in a few places, but all in all it seems to be working great. Could you have a read through it and see if I've done things reasonably correctly? https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusServer/tree/master/Streamus%20Web%20API It's under Web API and Web API Tests. 
I don't believe so, only because I'm not sure what the "base route attribute" is. Can you link me to some documentation?
[Integer formatting](http://www.csharp-examples.net/string-format-int/) [Aligning output](http://www.csharp-examples.net/align-string-with-spaces/) The other comment is also correct about the need for a monospaced font. And another note, since you're building a string, you should use a StringBuilder instead of +ing a bunch of strings together, it's faster and better for memory use.
I had a similar problem like this a few months back. My first recommendation would be to load a schema with it and verify the XML first and see if maybe its a formatting issue that's screwing things up. However, I think I did a Node Query from the root node of the document and that seemed to work. Sorry, I don't know the exact field and method names. 
This is a framework used to build game design tools, although I can see other uses. There is no 'lock-in' other than the framework was designed in house by Sony. You can use the code as you see fit as it is licensed under the liberal Apache license.
or rather in this case VB.Net &lt;&gt; VBA ;-)
The RoutePrefix: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/10/17/attribute-routing-in-asp-net-mvc-5.aspx If you don't include that, it will try to do it off the base url which won't work since you don't have any kind of unique url (/round) for that route, and its trying to match all your controllers.
So, I started poking at v1 of the code, but didn't get especially far as there are a lot of dependencies on NH and Autofac and other things that I scrupulously avoid. ;) A couple of quick suggestions: It would be better to have no customizations at all in App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs. Instead, use the new RoutePrefix and RouteAttribute stuff. Use these to decorate the controllers and methods directly so there is no flipping back and forth to puzzle over route rules, parameter names and type restrictions, etc. Returning IHttpActionResult will give you more flexibility to return RESTful error conditions and whatnot. [RoutePrefix("user")] public class UserController : ApiController { [Route("{id:guid}"] [HttpGet] public Task&lt;IHttpActionResult&gt; GetUser(Guid id) { User user; var trans = await _repo.BeginTransactionAsync(); using (trans) { user = await _repo.GetUserAsync(id); } return this.Ok(user); } Edit: I don't know how to make code blocks on reddit.
So has anyone played with this yet? I've started on the documentation but I'm still trying to take in the whole concept.
There should only be one RoutePrefix at the top of the class. You don't need to use the standard mvc routing if you use attribute routing.
I used a RoutePrefix on RoundController and AccountController, and ended up with the same ambiguous route error. The code looked like this: [RoutePrefix("{groupid}")] public class RoundController : ControllerBase { [Route("{campaignid}/{accesstoken}")] public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; TempRoundLink(string groupid, string campaignid, string accesstoken) { } } [RoutePrefix("Account")] public class AccountController : ControllerBase { [AllowAnonymous] [Route("ResetPassword/{token}")] public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; ResetPassword(string token) { } } Either way, I've found a solution which I will post soon. Thanks for the help.
The route prefix can't be a variable, it should be "round" or whatever
Ah. And therein lies the problem, I suppose. Most of our routes are variable.
Ok watched a video on YouTube by the team. The open osc controller looked very cool and I can think of an infinite ways to use the state machine designer outside of a video game pipeline. I guess it'd be helpful to see a high level diagram as to what the library is specifically wrapping around or exposing to you (or rtfm haha). The description of 'library to make tools' is a little vague.
Haha no joke, I responded above with 'I can think of an infinite ways to use a state machine designer...' before even seeing your username.
What I'm trying to say is the routing engine doesn't know if you are trying to go to {groupid}/{campaignid}/{accesstoken} or account/resetpassword/token because they are both {string}/{string}/{string}. Thats why you should use a prefix like yoururl.com/round/{groupid}/{campaignid}/{accesstoken} or setup custom rules in the routing config.
Yea, that's what I figured is going on. I've been pulling my hair out because my understanding was that string literals would match before variable parameters. Clearly that isn't the case, and there doesn't appear to be a way to order attribute routes, which is frustrating. I had been creating custom constraint resolvers and convention-based routes when ambiguous routes popped up, but I'm on a quest to figure out the real way to do this. I opted to use the [AttributeRouting](http://attributerouting.net/) project, which is working perfectly. Thanks again for the help.
Okay! I'll work on those tonight.
it's kismet, this framework was meant for you :p
talk of whatever you like. :) I just submitted some. But don't worry. More will come.. :)
Hi, author of tumblr# here! Using the library should be pretty simple and you should be able to follow examples. If you want to just extract the OAuth piece from my library it should be also easy enough (I didn't separate it out because I didn't want to have too many dependencies and leave the library easy to use). The main issue at the moment is that to perform the OAuth flow you have to prompt Tumblr's authorization page in a browser control, get the user authorization and extract the token from the browsed URL... a lot of annoying work. This is very simple in Windows 8 as there is something called the WebAuthenticationBroker that does all of it for you in one call. I was working on an update to have similar functionality in WPF and Windows Phone but other stuff forced me to put that on hold. Anyway, I'd be more than happy to help you out with if you need.
It does them in order, you have the attribute routing before the "static" route for the account controller. Not sure if that would fix it, but I'd still say use some kind of a prefix if you can, it will help you in the long run.
Actually it does allow for discussion about the code below (as with /u/mattimus_maximus) as well as the discussion of "is posting every single blog post worth it"? In this case, as someone who recently was tinkering with TCP stuff, this post was worth it for maximus' comment below. 
As someone who was looking into doing some tcp stuff, I was noodling around with event driven possibilities. I love .net because almost every built in part of the framework has a billion (overstatement) events that you can wire into. With few exceptions, I almost never need to thread (except when trying to eek out some performance or when doing something outside the UI thread). I have to say, however, that the first method seems mighty tempting just for practice. Much like BackgroundWorker vs actual threads or System.Net.Webclient over a webrequest, I'll take a simpler but less efficient method any day (my work rarely requires precision performance like you suggest, my bosses are happy with programs that don't have memory leaks). Anyway, is there anything *wrong* with event driven methods?
I hope you keep it up., but there is some kind of 1:10 reddiquette on submissions / comments. This isn't the most active sub so it's noticeable when there are many submissions from your blog. Anyway, it's good that you are blogging and people can critique (hopefully not overly negatively) and we can all learn.
Nothing wrong with event driven events other than slightly more complex with handling incoming data. You get handed an ArraySegment of data which you need to copy off somewhere, then decide what to do with it. The difficulty comes when you get the following payloads arrive in to your event: &lt;Event1&gt;Hello W&lt;/Event1&gt; &lt;Event2&gt;orld\r\n&lt;/Event2&gt; In this situation, you need to store the data from the first event, then when the second comes in, recombine them. With the await/async method you can just wrap your stream in a StreamReader and do await sr.ReadLineAsync() and it won't return until you have a complete line. Any excess that has been sent beyond the \r\n will be buffered automatically ready for the next call. With events, you also need to deal with the following data being sent: &lt;Event1&gt;Hello World\r\nIsn't it a nice day\r\n&lt;/Event1&gt; Which you need to split up yourself. A lot of this can be overcome by using a memory stream and feed in at one end, and wrap is with a stream reader at another end, but it means a slightly more complicated app. SocketAsyncEventArgs was written to be a very high performance model with relatively easy usage. I would definitely recommend using that or async/await. I once wrote a test harness using async/await which scalled to 60,000 client connections using just 100 threads. And this was sending data about once every 15 seconds per connection.
Would you ever get payloads like: &lt;Event1&gt;Hello Wor&lt;/Event1&gt; &lt;Event2&gt;ld\r\n And No&lt;/Event2&gt; &lt;Event3&gt;w for something we&lt;/Event3&gt; and so on... essentially could you get a line break with trailing data or do always either have a \r\n and no trailing data, or no \r\n at all? Sorry if these are inane noob questions. I'm a Jr Developer at a software firm with no formal education so I'm constantly worried I'm doing everything entirely wrong. My bosses are happy, and I'm ecstatic, but any chance I get to pick someone's brain about the finer points of proper procedure is glorious for me.
You could under the right conditions. The reality is that there are buffers along the path which will wait for some condition (either time or they are full) which should give you a pretty large chunk of data at once. And if the remote end sends it in a single send operation, even if it's split into multiple tcp packets, there are mechanisms (PUSH TCP flag on final packet if you want to know what to research) which usually cause all the data to arrive in the same chunk and buffer boundaries as it was originally sent in. But you have to expect it to be possible to arrive similar to your example.
I know I keep saying "I tried that already," but I have tried that already. :) Same issue. The prefix name isn't up to me, so I couldn't add it if I wanted to. AttributeRouting is making all of this work, however. I'm pleased with how it's functioning at the moment.
Am I the only one that think automapper is a horrible tool that hides mapping functions for a very small convinience gain?
I haven't used it, but it looks like a pretty big gain to me. Writing mapping code is tedious.
Big gain? Even the most complicated view models will take you less than 5 minutes to write a _testable_ mapper for. Automapper saves you very little time at the cost of code maintainability.
&gt; just wondering how i can create a word document and populate it with data using a vba script that works with my c# program. What does that mean? Example?
Hey, Thanks for the feedback. I actually wrote that a while ago. Nowadays I would have used Tasks to handle clients. And of course I wasn't thinking in handling 300K users. So optimizations was not part of the plan. Thank you.
Hello and thank you for your kind observation. But heres a thought, do you really think I would advertise my games, in 'this' particular sub-reddit??.. Nope.. Just as I've submitted the articles on CodeProject, I've put them here for whoever wants to read them. If you want to talk about the topics, be free to do so, if not, downvote it. I don't really care. I'm not trying to meet a quota of visitors. Cheers!
Of course, you *could* skip the lock and replace the read with Volatile.Read(ref value)... But I guess he didn't want to mention that. Plus, like he says, what's the point of losing the safety of the lock... Unless you need the extra speed. 
Here is the code ; The words are in Swedish at the moment { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { double[] aDensitet = { 1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9 }; double dDensitet = double.Parse(Interaction.InputBox("Ange en densitet")); double dSkillnad = double.PositiveInfinity; int index = -1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; aDensitet.Length; i++) { double dNuvarandeSkillnad = Math.Abs(aDensitet[i] - dDensitet); if (dNuvarandeSkillnad &lt; dSkillnad) { dSkillnad = dNuvarandeSkillnad; index = i; } if (aDensitet[i] &gt; dDensitet) break; } Interaction.MsgBox("Du valde " + dDensitet + " " + "Den närmaste densiteten är: "+ aDensitet[index]); } } }

The current code is doing that, The problem is that its taking the closest code, not the closest Below which is what im searching for, that is the problem. 
How much speed are you honestly going to gain, a few microseconds at most at a cost of possibly corrupting downline data If those microseconds are crucial in the solution, I feel the use of CSharp in that solution should really be reevaluated
Ye Interlocked works great
I dont really understand, do you mean with something like and "IF ELSE" or such to do that?
Interlocked is not the same. Ensuring atomicity is not the same as protecting against memory operations being re-ordered. There's no interlocked method just to read a 32-bit integer; because 32-bit integer reads and writes are already atomic (as mandated by the CLR memory model). This was actually Eric Lippert's point: If you don't understand the difference between atomicity and memory consistency, you maybe shouldn't be using things like Interlocked; instead, stick to locks (Monitors). Incidentally, the Interlocked methods all evoke a full memory fence anyway.
Yeah, I can't think of many places where it's necessary, I have to say. I think they do tend to use it in high-frequency-trading apps. I've also made some judicious use of lock-free programming in a parallelized game engine I'm writing :)
&gt; Interlocked http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.interlocked.read(v=vs.110).aspx This is kind of interesting although also doesn't make sense to me. Apparently 64 is already atomic reads, but 32 is not atomic without interlocked.read I've never had a situation where I needed to deal with locked reading, just locked increment which interlocked works great for. Now I'm thinking I need to read up on this :/
Just wondering: for someone with resharper, is this still useful? A lot of features seem similar.
Yes, here's what I ended up using: - Reorganize code (moves code around to fit a customizable layout. Like putting methods in alphabetical order, etc.) - Cleanup code (cleans up formatting-- Resharper can do this, but CodeMaid seems to be "better" at it, more sane). - CodeMaid Spade - gives you a nice GUI view of the currently open file, listing methods and their signatures, classes, etc. -- as well as their complexity score
The resharper formatter is full customisable, including member ordering. I'm going to give codemaid a go to see how it compares.
Interlocked also serves as a memory barrier. On x86 it performs a `lock cmpxchg` where the `lock` keeps the memory consistent.
Ohhh makes sense, I wasn't even aware you could use a 64-bit int on a 32-bit system. Thanks for the answer, learn something new every day :)
Yep, like I said.
The 300K users was just to show the point of the problem with threads. Even handling 50-100 users I would say using Threads isn't great. I know you weren't intending to scale to 300K users with your solution, but teaching other people to handle web requests with a bad pattern is still teaching a bad pattern. It's a bit like saying to someone you can cut grass with a pair of scissors. While technically true, and if they only have a few blades to cut it wouldn't do any harm using scissors, you wouldn't suggest using them to mow a half acre lawn. To that you might reply "but it's obvious that you shouldn't use scissors", but it wouldn't be obvious to someone who has never seen a lawn mower before. Why show people the wrong way when it's a bad idea even though it works in a pinch when you can show them the correct way. SocketAsyncEventArgs is a relatively easy thing to wrap your head around, and msdn has some great example code. Repeat after me everyone, ***"Threads don't solve async problems"***.
I can second this (for reorganizing and spade, didn't try their cleanup yet), certainly a useful tool to have even with ReSharper :) And yes, I was one of those 10k :D
Maybe it's in later versions, but in VS2010, I have a _huge_ solution (199 projects at this point) so I find that its [build progress](http://www.codemaid.net/documentation/#progressing) feature a nice quality-of-life improvement for me.
Here's an example: object toLock = new ClassOne(); new Thread(() =&gt; DoWork(toLock)).Start(); toLock = new ClassTwo(); new Thread(() =&gt; DoWork(toLock)).Start(); //Result: Both threads print 0-100 simultaneously void DoWork(object toLock) { lock(toLock) { for(int i =0;i&lt;100;i++) { Thread.Sleep(100); Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}",i); } } } What happens there is: Thread 1 locks on the instance of ClassOne (note, instance, aka pointer) Thread 2 locks on the instance of ClassTwo. Both threads, while locked, lock on DIFFERENT instances / pointers, meaning they can run independently of each other. If the object you're locking on is read-only, the value can never be changed after instantiation, meaning that everything that locks on to that object is synced. So, in the previous example, if it were read only (or never re-assigned) thread 1 would lock, print 0-100, unlock, then thread 2 will be able to lock, print 0-100, etc. **tldr;** locks operate on references, making it read-only assures that the reference never changes when you use that field. Also, sorry for the shitty code, i write it entirely in the reddit editor, which is a pain in the ass to do
Order your array of densities (they already are, but you should check) and then iterate over them until your condition is met: double[] aDensitet = { 1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9 }; double dDensitet = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); Array.Sort(aDensitet); int index = aDensitet.Length-1; while(aDensitet[index]&gt;dDensitet) { index--; } Console.WriteLine("Du valde " + dDensitet + " " + "Den närmaste densiteten är: "+ aDensitet[index]);
thanks, understood you better than the msdn article.
What type of solution is it? To me, huge is 20 projects. 
Obligatory LINQ solution: var myDensities = new[] {1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9}; var target = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); var bestDensity = ( from density in myDensities let discrepancy = Math.Abs(density - target) orderby discrepancy select density).First(); Console.WriteLine(bestDensity); But if you mean that it should necessarily choose the closest number that is **less** than the input number, then you want var myDensities = new[] {1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9}; var target = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); var bestDensity = ( from density in myDensities let discrepancy = target - density where discrepancy &gt; 0 orderby discrepancy select density).FirstOrDefault(); Console.WriteLine(bestDensity == default(double) ? "No density smaller than target density." : bestDensity.ToString() );
Hey sorry for taking so long to respond. I wanted to make sure I had adequate time to lay out what you will need / where to look. First there are a few areas you'll want to break your reporting system / BI solution into: data warehousing, Extract-Transform-Load (ETL), and reporting. #References for data warehousing Kimball Group: http://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/ I strongly urge you to learn about dimensional modelling and the Kimball methodology to structuring and storing data. It will make your life much easier if you spend most of your time focusing on how you will store your data in your DWH. Key terms to learn to get some basic concepts: * Fact table * Dimension table * Slowly changing dimension * Star schema * Denormalization * Cubes and multidimensional databases (e.g., SSAS, Hyperion) This link is great for the above terms: http://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/ #References for ETL For ETL, your primary tool will probably SSIS or SQL stored procedures. Good write up on what ETL is: http://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/etl-architecture-34-subsystems/ #References for reports This is where the MS BI stack is weakest. The default reporting tool is SSRS, which is dated and limited. I much prefer doing as much reporting as possible through Excel using a cube connected pivot table when the users do not wish to purchase a better tool. Alternatively, there are a lot of good ASP.NET visualization options out there (especially from Telerik) so if you are an ASP.NET dev and are comfortable writing your own reporting tools, ASP.NET is a good choice. There's a lot more I want to write, but I don't want to flood you with info. If you have any questions or want clarification on anything, let me know.
A commenter on the article made a similar comment. Eric's response: &gt; Good point, but unfortunately making the read volatile without a lock is not sufficient to ensure that it is not moved! Though the sort of caching you describe is not legal with a volatile read, on x86 even a volatile read may be moved backwards in time with respect to volatile writes. Perhaps I should show an example of how that can happen.
Alright, I got all the attribute routing sorted + I've got test cases to back them all up and managed to clean up a little bit of the rest of the code. Still no async stuff yet though. Probably won't do that for this release cuz I've touched a lot already. Can you explain the Task&lt;IHttpActionResult&gt; bit? I don't understand at all atm. EDIT: nm. Task means "Returns an async result so you gotta wait a bit for it" but I still don't get why its better to return an IHttpActionResult. Shouldn't you try to be as specific as possible with returns but as generic as possible with accepted parameters?
I love NCrunch. Unfortunately it's so expensive. :-\
Yeah, it would be good if there was a cheaper version
I've wanted something like this ever since I missed that resharper sale.
Yeah, it seems like a few people thought what I did and it will be interesting to see his response. He said he'd give an example on 26th March. I can't believe that a Volatile write followed by a Volatile read can be swapped. I'm hoping I'm right (otherwise, what's the point of volatile? :)).
aha lol that simple ._. thanks
You're actually looking for "Duplication". "Duplicity" is a totally different thing. 
I think he means something like this: var myDensities = new[] {1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9}; var target = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); var closest = double.MinValue; for (var i = 0; i &lt; myDensities.length; i++) if ((myDensities[i] &lt; target) &amp;&amp; (myDensities[i] - target &gt; closest - target)) closest = myDensities[i]; Console.WriteLine(closest &gt; double.MinValue ? closest : "No density smaller than target density"); Since the check will always fail after myDensities[i] &gt;= target, you can do var myDensities = new[] {1.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.7, 7.9, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9}; var target = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); var closest = double.MinValue; for (var i = 0; i &lt; myDensities.length; i++) { if (myDensities[i] &gt;= target) break; if (myDensities[i] - target &gt; closest - target) closest = myDensities[i]; } Console.WriteLine(closest &gt; double.MinValue ? closest : "No density smaller than target density");
After having my mental model of memory coherency blown apart a little by the [Eric Lippert blog post](http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/20ayky/can_i_skip_the_lock_when_reading_an_integer/) that was on here earlier, I asked a question on Stack Overflow. After getting a couple of interesting answers, I decided to share it with you guys here. :)
You should look into [the Reactive library](http://introtorx.com). This is what it does, and it does it *very* well. If you go some other route, you don't need a queue. You said it yourself "there is really only ever 1 or 0 items in the queue".
Note that String.Format works the same way.
For clarification: Your problem is not calling a function inside a thread - you can just do that normally. Your problem is accessing member functions of the UI thread from another thread, which simply does not work.
Obligatory Disclaimer: Only one day's usage thusfar. None. Infact it has the option to delegate the code cleanup to ReSharper's "silent cleanup" feature. I'm going to stick to having both, they are not direct competitors. Many features in ReSharper are not included and CodeMaid and vice versa. Code Spade is an awesome window. It's a navigation window with a few useful stats. Things like method cyclomatic complexity score. ReSharper is more configurable than CodeMaid, but many of the features included in CodeMaid don't need much configuration anyway. The future will tell though. CodeMaid is open source, after all. :)
Thanks! I actually have a lot of experience writing SQL stored procs (passed my 70-461 exam a few months ago) and working with large data sets, so I'm not too worried about the ETL process. I'll also end up incorporating this data into a website I've already written in ASP.NET, so that covers the reporting/presentation portion. I'll take a look at those data warehousing links since I honestly don't know what any of those basic concepts/key terms mean, and have no experience with data warehousing at all. I'm the only dev working at my company and am completely self taught, so I appreciate the help! I wasn't even aware of data warehousing until I started researching the MCSA for SQL Server 2012 and watched a prep video about their data warehousing exam (70-463).
Yeah, of course. I just started learning C# again yesterday, and I've never gotten very deep into it.
Here is a little mod that is useful when you need to invoke an entire method on the main thread so you don't have to keep writing new delegates (untested) private Int32 chVol(String vol) { Int32 retval = false; if (this.InvokeRequired) { this.Invoke((MethodInvoker) delegate() { retval = chVol(vol); return retval; }); } if (vol == "down") { retval = SendMessageW(this.Handle, WM_APPCOMMAND, this.Handle, (IntPtr)APPCOMMAND_VOLUME_DOWN); } else if (vol == "up") { retval = SendMessageW(this.Handle, WM_APPCOMMAND, this.Handle, (IntPtr)APPCOMMAND_VOLUME_UP); } return retval; }
I ended up completely de-coupling the DTOs from the domain objects. No more Create methods, just constructors which expect parameters. :)

Thanks. Might just use this if I try to put a slider thingy on the app. Tried it and failed miserably earlier.
&gt; Tried something like this Console.WriteLine("{0}", numHours &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; "0" || "" + numHours); This would be written using the ternary operator ?: like so: Console.WriteLine("{0}", numHours &lt; 10 ? "0" + numHours : numHours); I would still suggest using /u/Christostravitch 's method, as a format string is a better option. The above example will prepend a 0 onto 0 and negative numbers, which isn't the desired outcome. [?: Operator (C# Reference)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ty67wk28.aspx)
There is a tutorial out there on this scenario. I don't remember where I saw it though, I'm pretty sure on MSDN somewhere, search for something like signalr chat. For DB I'd go with Redis and the like, since chat is somewhat instant you want an in-memory DB. Although ideally you only want to store temp data there, i.e. data in transit to the user, then move to on disk db, if you use k/v store it's a seamless transition, since most in memory ones are k/v stores. Beyond that you just need to look at your needs to figure out what structure you want your data to have For status you can have it with signalr or have the app periodically ping the server (bad idea, but as a last resort or prototype is easier to implement). You'd store in memory the status of the user. Of course for that you need to sort out "edge cases" like if the user gets disconnected, how will they notify the system, etc 
Use GTK# instead. MonoDevelop has good support for it and it works well across platforms (looks better too)
The reason the tutorials aren't making sense to you is you don't have the requisite knowledge about how a game is developed, just from a theoretical standpoint. It's not enough to know what a string is. You have to know about structuring game logic, and modeling, and texture mapping, and light mapping, and animating, and threading, and network coding, and backend server structures, and SQL database modeling, and it would help to know a programming language and its features, types, nuances etcetera. Instead of trying to make a game and looking for a tutorial you should try to learn something about programming or digital design and slowly put all those pieces together. /u/royFat is right, make a string based text game to learn some logic and structure.
OK so let's break this down. Binding of Isaac is a 2D rpg, with random algorithmicly generated levels, with progressive unlocks and extensibility. You would like to make a similar game with no knowledge of programming or game design. I hate to be an asshole here, but dude, stay the hell away from trying to design something like this before you are comfortable with at minimum programming. Just logic alone for dynamic algorithmic level generation is complex enough for people who have been programming for years, let alone a beginner. Granted you can use something along the lines of Unity, but at that point you still need to know programming, alas less so than writing it by hand, but more importantly you need to know game design. You also will need to know game as well as programming jargon. I suggest as /u/RoyFat &amp; /u/MrRGnome suggested, make a very simple text based game, or even a tic tac toe, before jumping into the mess of trying something complex
i understand this is good for me to hear. i like being corrected its the only way for me to learn
I suggest this. Take the basic CSharp course, it will give you some intro into the language http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners#?fbid=KPvdGmJvLyP &amp; http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developer-training-with-programming-in-c#?fbid=KPvdGmJvLyP Make a few small programs along the lines of FizzBuzz and the like, this is simply an exercise to get your mind to transition problem solving into code, which is harder than it sounds when you start :) Then this should give you enough to understand the basics of programming variables, functions/methods, loops, program structure, etc. You'll need those in everything you do. After learn about data structures, algorithms, etc. Everytime you learn something new, implement it into code to solidify understanding. By this point you should be comfortable enough to be able to write code without freaking the hell out lol At this point you can focus a little more towards games, there are a few courses online in regards to that. Also check out Unity, they have a load of courses which are specific to Unity, but also dive into reasoning behind why something is done. Also most MOOCs (coursera, udacity, etc) have something along the lines of a game design course. Basically you want to learn the concepts before treading into that territory Once you learn the concepts look at github and the like to see if there are any game projects you like. Look at the source code, structure, etc. Download the source and modify it, basically have fun. Make something in Unity. Basically hack and create until you feel comfortable. Than you will at least be "minimally" preapared to make your own. The good thing is this is all you need as long as you have an open mind. If you understand what you're doing, you start getting a sense of when something goes wrong. You will likely know what's going wrong, maybe not why, or how to fix it. That's why reddit is here, and Stack Overflow. But basically you need to put in the time to learn, and you need to while(true) WriteCode(); lol
It has a lot of bugs and is slow. Use GTK#. 
I could make some tutorials if people would be interested.
Wow thanks this is the most helpful comment yet
If you have a Win32 driver for ext4 or whatever file system your Ubuntu setup is using, it's possible to write a C# wrapper application for it. This driver will usually be written in C/C++. But this is a long shot by any means. And yes, this is something that fiddles with your hardware, so I don't think you should try it on your own data as it could be dangerous. 
What you're wanting to do is quite complex, but certainly not impossible. Normally this would be done by writing a file system driver. As /u/green_transistor stated, drivers are usually written in C/C++. In fact, you can't write kernel-mode drivers in C# at all, but you can write user-mode ones in C#. I do not know if filesystem drivers fall under user or kernel mode, but I imagine they are user-mode. [Here are some samples of drivers written in C#](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowshardware/Windows-8-Driver-Samples-5e1aa62e/view/SamplePack). ----- An alternative, easier method if you just wanted some C# application that could browse your Ubuntu partition on its own. This would not allow access to the partition in Windows Explorer, but only in your app. [Here's some overview information on raw disk access in Windows](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100027). The documentation is for the Win32 API for C/C++, but you can import the necessary functions with P/Invokes. Also contrary to what the name suggests, [CreateFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363858.aspx) is for opening files too (so don't get confused at the concept of "creating" the raw disk.) You *might* also be able to use [StreamReader](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.aspx), but I can't say I've ever tried. ------ However, the worst bit of all of this is going to be parsing the actual filesystem. The filesystem is a data structure stored on your hard disk that describes all of the attributes, data, organization, etc of all of your files. I believe Ubuntu uses ext4 by default. [This wiki seems to be the authoritative documentation resource for ext4](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/), and [this page in particular should be useful](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout), however [this thread](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1794185) suggests that this information is incorrect or incomplete. The other alternative is to do what he did and read the source code for ext4. One more thing, as /u/green_transistor suggested, what you are doing is a bit dangerous and doing things incorrectly could read to data loss. I would highly advise against trying to do anything involving writing data to the Ubuntu partition on your primary machine, you should try to acquire a separate testing computer if you want to do that. Old laptops are great for stuff like that. However, it should be fairly safe to do read-only access since you won't corrupt anything that way. Good luck!
best search ever! :)
I currently teach programming to high schoolers and once the lesson plan is made it usually only takes a day or so.
Forgot about this way, same as PHP if I'm not mistaken
An ambitious first project, but if you're asking the question then you might not be ready for this quite yet :) 
GTK has a 'native' theme for windows, its just not the default.
Virtual machine would make way more sense. &gt;However, the worst bit of all of this is going to be parsing the actual filesystem. The filesystem is a data structure stored on your hard disk that describes all of the attributes, data, organization, etc of all of your files. No need to write a fs parser from the ground up, esp of that isn't an explicit goal of the project. You could warp something like libext2fs(actually iirc there is a wrapper already for this.)
Ubuntu uses Ext4 for its files. Just like how your USB stick uses FAT32 and your harddrive uses NTFS (I hope). However, Ext4 is more complex than FAT or NTFS, for example it has error correction where a reserved part of the partition is used to write files, and when it crashes the other files aren't corrupted. This makes it hard to implement in Windows, Windows also needs to be compatible with older versions of itself too. That's why there is no implementation for Windows, and there probably wont be for a while. So, to answer your question. This is a very risky program to write. **t will damage your data if you do something wrong. It is theoretically possible in C# but it would be like cleaning a statue with a broken toothbrush.
How do you mean the api changed so much? To query a rest service all you need is an httpclient. You can use any of the built in c# networking namespaces or an external library. How do you mean a lot has changed for win 8.1?
The databinding/viewmodel stuff has changed, the default project templates have changed in VS2013, System.Net.HttpClient is no longer used instead Windows.Web.Net.HttpClient is used and has a lot of the new Async operations. Basically if I do the Hands On Lab from Windows 8 on VS2013/Win8.1 most of the stuff doesn't work. It's impossible to learn all this new stuff while trying to troubleshoot why the instructions in the tutorial are not working as the instructor says.
