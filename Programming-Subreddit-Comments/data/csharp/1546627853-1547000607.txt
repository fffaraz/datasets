You should have a two-fold strategy: a) learn to make a real-world app as others have mentioned, and b) educate yourself on best practices. Make a web site or WPF app that lets you "collect" baseball cards or Pokemon or anything at all. Collecting and retrieving data is one of the most fundamental functions of most software apps. Or look at examples like Hanselman's "Nerd Dinners" web site concept in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC. It's not hard to come up with simple but effective ideas that show you know how to create working software. Don't expect to write the next Facebook, just do something non-trivial. Learn about SOLID, dependency injection, and unit testing. If you could demonstrate a working knowledge of those 3 things to me, you are a good job candidate for a junior position. I've known many software developers that couldn't (or wouldn't) learn these important principles and yet they still had jobs. 
NSIS
Unlearn it all. Then re-learn it!
Thats amazing! I'll have a play with it, thank you so much!
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o
Then you should have been more specific in your post. It's more than a factor two improvement, but anyway if you want heterogeneous compute you might wanna have a look at SYCL. 
Looks cool but it broke when I tried to move the WinForm around. Page froze.
On my chrome moving around is really slow! But it is obviously very very buggy! and even this version is unoptimized version....so plenty of room for bug fixing and optimizations.....
Still a cool project, lots to learn. :)
I threw up in my mouth just now 
Look I'm trying to assume your advice is coming from a good place. But directing me away from C# is not helpful, it's actually quite infuriating. 
No you didn't.
I am pretty sure you didn’t install the correct version of Visual Studio. Or rather didn’t install the components you need. Close VS and run the Visual Studio Installer app, Click on modify for your installation, then make sure you have the .NET Desktop Development package selected. 
I can't seem to find DirectX/DirectCompute matrix Arithmetic examples Do you know where that part of the API is documented?
Do you have a git repo yet?
Neat! Care to share the source or any additional info about how you did this?
MS already tried it when webform releasing
Pretty cool, but like everyone else said, very buggy/laggy. I couldn't get the WinForm to do much before it became unresponsive in Chrome. It fared a better in FireFox; it didn't seem to freeze. Unfortunately, most of the controls didn't respond when I clicked on them. :( &amp;#x200B; Also it looks more dated than current .NET WinForms, looks more like VB6, to me anyways. 
When has that ever stopped anyone?
I second this, mainly because I had a previous employer who used Advanced Installer to do pretty much the same thing as what OP desires. 
yes soon.
not yet. working on it
it is strange that controls are not responsive. I could click on buttons, change radiobox and etc, even on my phone's browser. But yes it looks a bit outdated and very buggy!
Statics methods are not bad. In fact there are a lot of them in common use: Linq, Microsoft.Extensions.* libs have a lot of them. I personally would write any class where I don't need to inject dependencies as static. Static state is bad. If you dont have state, then a static method is a pure function and easier to test and parallelize. Also tasks and threads are different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. You can certainly have a task where the work runs on a different thread. You can also have a task that "doesnt run on a thread" (overlapped IO). Threads are OS constructs. Tasks are just descriptors of things that will happen in the future that you can choose to wait on. That said, for most cases the TPL is the way to go. There will also be cases where you want to create explicit long lived threads. Use the right tool for the job.
This is similar to "goto is evil" or "threads are evil" or "shared state is evil" or "premature optimization is evil" etc. -- it's just things we teach newbies so they don't shoot themselves in the foot with something that is very easy to misuse. Eventually people realize nothing is inherently evil, and it all has its uses, and hopefully this is once they've got some experience and won't misuse those things.
Cool idea. Can you reduce the amount that needs to be transferred over the wire? Chrome tells me it downloaded over 35mb of resources.
Fuck. Nobody tells that to my boss. We will be doing Windows Forms for another 15 years in browser this time instead of finally moving web!!!!!!
It's a saying, not a literal event...
Did you install visual studio code instead of visual studio community? There is a version that is only meant for supervisors to use to do code reviews so a lot of stuff is 'missing' (I am not talking about the light weight version of visual studio) . I did this by accident and noticed it because it had the issue that there were no templates installed. &amp;#x200B; Visual studio community should have winforms, console and web app at the very least. &amp;#x200B;
Try to get the vanilla Visual Studio community edition: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ The templates are just that, templates for different kind of apps. A console applications is something than one with windows (classic or WPF) or a webserver based app. (Asp.Net) Don't worry about the acronyms and stuff for now though. Get the community edition and pick "Console Application" and it should do what you need.
Don't pretend like OOP is some small part of programming, it's a fundamental and complete basic concept that you need to learn if you wanna take yourself seriously. I don't even wanna get started on who's a little bitch here lol
Read and try to implement examples of these patterns: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/
It's a movie quote, not a saying.
What movie? Honestly curious. Never heard about that.
Holy crap you put X11 in this thing? How does it all work?
That kept happening to me, eventually I realized I needed to start using antacids

Just... no...
Instantly made me think of the quote from a movie “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should” On a serious note though, this is pretty cool. Nice work op. 
Awesome! I'll be sure to take a closer look later. Thanks!
Oh shit I've seen this scene. Guess I forgot it made its way into pop culture. Thanks!
Slow as fuck, but still fascinating. 
Cool I'm happy to help once it is up :)
My guess is that you are using the same webassembly mono runtime that blazor uses and have ported the half-complete mono winforms port or are using the newly open-sourced winforms code from microsoft :)
Probably not the answer your looking for, but without you posting the errors your getting it might be hard to help you further. I use a a library named [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) to simplify making we requests. Also checkout this stack overflow post for more in detail descriptions on different ways to make web requests.
A few notes: 1. Your English is pretty good. : ) 2. Lack of tabs makes that hard to read so I'm going to write how I would have expressed it (none of this has been tested, fair warning): &amp;#8203; String[] prompts = [ "Enter a number [min]: ", "Enter a number [max]: ", "Number of elements to calculate the average (between min and max): " ] int[] numbers = int[3]; while(keepGoing) { for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) { Console.Write(prompts[i]); n[i] = ValidateInteger(Console.ReadLine()); if(n &lt;= 0) { Error(); break; } } Console.WriteLine("The average {0} of the values are: {1}\n", n, Average(n[0], n[1], n[2])); } So if we look at it like this, we can see that an Error() call will cause us to exit the current series of questions entirely. This is the issue you said you were having with your code. The easiest way to handle this would be to cause the for loop to reenter at the came count. So we can do something like: String[] prompts = [ "Enter a number [min]: ", "Enter a number [max]: ", "Number of elements to calculate the average (between min and max): " ] int[] numbers = int[3]; while(keepGoing) { for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) { Console.Write(prompts[i]); n[i] = ValidateInteger(Console.ReadLine()); if(n &lt;= 0) { Error(); i = i-1; ///////////////////////////This makes us retry this question } } Console.WriteLine("The average {0} of the values are: {1}\n", n, Average(n[0], n[1], n[2])); } &amp;#x200B;
Nice work! 
How do people start work on a project this large, and not have something to commit to as the very first step? Or do you have a repo, just not a git repo?
I do have a repo but the problem is this tool uses many different repos. and I had to modify all of them. So it is using probably like 5 or 6 different repos which I made changes to them. Now my problem is how to manage all these changes somewhere......
probably not much. maybe the best would be around 20 or 10mb
That is another fun project I am doing which would be ready in a week or two! this one actually implemented all windows apis :D
actually it started because my boss wanted it....such a good idea to use winforms in browser, right? :D
There was WPF in browser... I think people called it silverlight. Now time for travel back in time. Are you sure we don't have same boss?
Because you can't get started. This is the point. 
no it is mono's winforms
switching to mono AOT would increase speed like 40,50% but right now there are tons of other more important bugs to consider.....
Cool that would have been my guess as it was already built for cross platform :) 
You're either genius or evil. Naive me says you can sell this so get the license correct.
Core 3.0 is supposed to open up windows forms. Not that that has anything to do with this, but it seemed relevant. &amp;#x200B; [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/)
Yep this is it.. I was trying to get it done quickly at work but now that I'm home and had more time to review the issue I bunged up the installation. Thanks for the advice!
It’s very common for newer users to have issues with Visual Studio installs, there is so much information and options that doing a ‘quick install’ can be more trouble than it’s worth. Just be glad you aren’t setting up Git repositories or TFS yet, lol. 
Have a look at these YT video's on WPF, a good starting point: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3AxeCHGPZkMi3kRfCuiHw)
What’s wrong with WinForms? MS has a long term commitment towards it. It’s going to be supported on Core 3. It’s a practical and usable platform. I fail to see the problem.
A little suspicious the URL bar changes to gdax.com, what are you trying to steal bitcoins?
There's nothing wrong with WinForms in the same sense that there's nothing wrong with Net Framework 3.5; people just prefer all of the extra features like data binding which we've come to expect out of modern UI frameworks. This permits you to attach a WPF app for example onto an event-sourcing architecture or Actor distributed system and have your views just snap in your observable context/timeline. WinForms will remain popular with certain people for a long time I have no doubt. I still like it for teaching people since XAML and JS both don't feel as natural as WinForms designer in a C# environment.
A `Claim` is a type which describes who or what an identity is. You can read an `IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt;` from the `ClaimsPrinciple.Claims` property. The identity itself represents a single declaration that may have many claims associated with it. **ClaimIdentity** public class ClaimsIdentity: IIdentity { public string AuthenticationType { get; } public bool IsAuthenticated { get; } public IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; Claims { get; } public Claim FindFirst(string type) { /*...*/ } public Claim HasClaim(string type, string value) { /*...*/ } } I have listed some of the methods from this type, but you can read all of them over at the [MSDN reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal?view=netcore-2.2). As you can see there are some helper methods for checking whether or not a `ClaimsIdentity` has a specific `Claim` by calling `HasClaim(type, value)` which also happen to be the values a `Claim` contains. **Claim** ClaimsPrincipal principal = HttpContext.Current.User as ClaimsPrincipal; if (null != principal) { foreach (Claim claim in principal.Claims) { Response.Write("CLAIM TYPE: " + claim.Type + "; CLAIM VALUE: " + claim.Value + "&lt;/br&gt;"); } } I think this should be enough basic information for you to dive into a more reliable source like the MSDN or a course on .NET Core authentication. I can only take you so far without writing a much more detailed post on the subject.
You create a branch in each repo and push to a new fork of it under your own account on GitHub or GitLab. Then you make a new repo and bring the other 5 repos in as submodules. I am a pro at this stuff. Please reach out to me if you want some help. Happy to do a screen share and chat to go through everything in my spare time. I’m very interested in what you’ve done here. 
Thanks. Actually that was what I had in my mind. Ive used submodules a lot and know theirs good and bad side. But what do you think about subtree? I've never used them and as probably I wont be pushing some of them back to their upstream, maybe it's a good choice?
The size is huge, but it really a very cool idea !
It's very ugly and not that customizable vs WPF, but easy for a beginner to get into.
Seemed responsive to me, though slow. Lots of graphical issues with black boxes. I used Edge.
Amazing and horrifying. Can't believe you implemented the WinForm API... Props to you man! Great work. Bug report: on my windows 10 machine + latest chrome, the controls get black border or all black.
To be precise WPF in browser was XBAP :) 
Removed: Rule 4. Try breaking down the problem. 1. How to sort the whole array (don't worry about even/odd) 2. How to determine if a number is odd or even Then for combining them, there's a couple ways how to do it, but I'm not sure what's the most appropriate based on what you've learned so far and how you go about sorting the array. One way is if you're using the `Array.Sort` method, to check if the even/odd status of the numbers you're comparing. If one is even and the other odd, you can just say one belongs ahead of the other. If they're both even out both odd, then you can compare which number is smaller of the two. But maybe try to get at least the first two parts done and make a code attempt on applying them to sort your array.
Thanks for answering so quickly, I've read what you said and it's pretty clear that leaving the method (with Error) doesn't do what I want my program to do but then it seems your code is too different than mine and I'm not sure how to use it properly. It looks like you're using \[the questions\] like arrays? I am not at that level for now. The latest we've learned is to use methods so we can have fewer lines in each of them. I believe we'll learn the arrays next week or the other. I kinda understand the for loop that you are using but as I said I don't know what to do with it or even how to reproduce it the way I could with the sum of the knowledge I got for now. :P Without editing my code drastically, is the solution to remove the Error(); method? Is there a way to counter that issue while still keeping the if loop? And finally, I guess the for loop is ideal in situations like that with multiple questions that are used together in the end? Before learning methods, we've learned the for loop and done not much but create triangles in the console or a multiplication table. xD Thank you so much for your help. PS: I will try to edit my original post so you can read the code better. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
&gt;removed: Rule 4 &amp;#x200B; Apparently not ;)

It seems like they become unresponsive after certain events. I tried it again just now and it looks like they stop responding if you try to click inside of the white text box/combo box on the left side of the form. After that it's pretty much frozen until you reload. If I try to use the keyboard, it seems like pretty much any key press (space bar, F12, enter, etc) causes it to freeze. It also becomes frozen if I try to drag the form around via the window chrome without first clicking on something inside of it (I.E. button 4).
Never used them, but seems like a good choice. 
Hello, thank you for spotting that, i will change it asap. D
Usually the problem is to find an image contained in a window displayed on the desktop and unless this is a full screen window it is way faster/easier to first find the window that contains the image and then process a screenshot of the window rather than the whole desktop. Obviously if the window is full screen like a game, then you have to do it the hard way. There are several tricks you can use to achieve better performance but these will depend on the specifics of your target image. Example - if the image is always the same then you can simplify the search if you can find unique pattern in the image that is sufficient to identify the image. If you control the target that is easy to arrange. If you have to do a full image compare then you can sometimes speed things up by converting the images to a binary image map set at some threshold If you have to do a full image comparison, use Bitmap.LockBits instead of getpixel! 
What movie? I'd like to watch it...
If you are able to use .NET Core there is now an even better way to handle HttpClient. With .NET Core you are able to DI it and let the runtime handle reusing and disposing of the client. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests
Why would you need webscra**p**ing when there is an API to use?
You are the devil. 
Sadly, the discord doesn't seems to provide any kind of ability webscrapping
It's from Jurassic Park
If Discord provides an API then there is no need for webscra**p**ing. That is only done when there is neither a public or private API available
And even tho there would be a other way to get this kind of info, this technic work "if it's stupid and it's working then it's ain't stupid" 
Dude missed the provigo scraping you did.
Have fun reinventing the wheel
Agreed with all you said.
There is no api for that. Compute shaders are very general purpose. You have to write all of that code yourself. The shaders just execute in parallel for you, but you have to create the UAV’s and the data transfer between the CPU and GPU and back. CUDA is easier to use, and it comes with several libraries that can help.
Winforms are great for RAD. And pretty much that is all it should be used with in 2019.
How does that work ? HTML Canvas ? Wow. Thanks fir warning me ! 
Yes it's silverlight, but microsoft stop supporting it long time ago.
My high school AP CS teacher joked about if loops
Umm multi-dimensional data...
Well, yeah, but when is that more useful than single-dimensional jagged arrays?
If I understand correctly you are asking what the purpose of a "jagged" array is - an array of arrays of arrays.. etc. Jagged arrays like this can hold multi-dimensional data, matrices, unlinked trees etc. C# also has an implementation for multi-dimensional arrays, but the performance compared to jagged arrays is worse. The only benefit is that they have slightly more features.
But is the wheel using three-layered architecture?
Ah, thank you. 
I haven't loaded it up, but perhaps visible or width or something needs to be set on the new control before it can be seen?
You are asking a rather vague question here, that is also not constrained to only Unity but applies to game creation in general. You are looking into implementing game physics via Unity or a 3rd party Library like BulletSharp. All good physics libraries include calculations for momentum impulses (what you refer to as jumping, buoyancy calculations and etc. Character movement is implemented by having animations created which dictate how different parts of a character move.
I made sure none of the main elements are in the way. I ran spitOut() from the button on Form 1 and the new label was created just fine.
&gt;Form1 main = **new** Form1();
does this mean you're sorted?
Is this theoretically creating another instance of Form 1? That's why I'm not seeing the result on the original form?
Yes
This kind of reasoning is not applicable to programming. If your code is stupid but works, it’s still bad code and needs to be improved.
I think there is some confusion/a language barrier here, so I will say what I think OP has done: OP has made a scraper that webscrapes the prices from their local supermarket and uses this as a source of information for their Discord bot (I.e made it so you can check the prices of stuff at the supermarket from within Discord). I am currently mid minor medical problem that is a bit painful, so I apologise if my wording isn’t as clear as it should be.
You wrote it fine, and so did OP. I dont get why there's confusion. 😅
Thanks :) My guess is most people don’t have a Provigo near them / have never heard of it before (to be completely fair I had no idea what it was until I Googled it).
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/constraints-on-type-parameters In this particular case, you could also simply cast to `A` instead of `T`. But constraints would be the type-safe option.
He's not scraping discord, he scraping a price from some website and pushing it to discord via a webhook or the api. I've done the same thing to send game server populations to discord servers to let folks know when people are playing.
Yes
Additionally to the answer of /u/tweq, please be aware that there is no such thing as templates in C#. There are only generics in C#, but not a powerful feature like templates.
Thanks for clarifying.
There is a neat discord library, forgot it’s name. Just search in nuget for discord.
Thanks for pointing me to right direction! I have actually already browsed that page, but seems like I didn't read it carefully. So it is enough to write `void AddNew&lt;T&gt;() where T : A` or I need to define a derived class also as `class C&lt;T&gt; where T : A`?
That depends on whether you only need the type parameter `T` at the method, or if the type parameter should be scoped to the entire class. As with most things, you should limit the visibility to the smallest scope feasible, so likely you only want the type parameter at the method. The `where T : A` will make sure that only types that derive from `A` can be passed to the type argument. This allows you to cast it to `A`, as every `T` is also an `A`.
I’m so sorry but just bear with me I’m quite a beginner and didn’t understand much of that, may you please explain it in a more simple manner. I’m so sorry to bother you about this but I’m quite young and new to Csharp, thanks for understanding
Well, because he wrote that he was using the Discord API to scrape the web.
ive used wpf for quite a while but thx ;) just curious how to get the new windows 10 menus and stuff because they looks quite nice :)
This person who obviously doesn't have English as their 1st language managed to construct a proper sentence that a large portion of you tards are unable to comprehend. Amazing. This is the cockiness that people refer to in IT teams. 
No he didn't. 
And yet I still find an awful lot of stupid code in Production projects 
lol
Good argument
Declare a static variable like this: Public static bool yesDo; Then when user says yes you set the bool as true. yesDo = true;
Just declare the variable before you set it. You also don't need to convert to string, Console.ReadLine() already returns a string.
Maybe another approach which is easier to read/understand is this: void Main() { var repeat = true; while(repeat){ int num1,num2; //we ask for first number while(true){ num1 = ValidateInteger(Console.ReadLine()); if(num1 &gt; 0) break; Console.WriteLine("Your provided number is not correct, try again!"); } //we ask for second number while(true){ num2 = ValidateInteger(Console.ReadLine()); if(num2 &gt; 0) break; Console.WriteLine("Your provided number is not correct, try again!"); } //do now whatever you want here with num1 and num2 //ask for repeat too } } 
I would look into the FileSystemWatcher which is part of the .net framework. The official docs are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher?view=netframework-4.7.2) 
Thank you for your reply! The “folder” is not on the local machine and its more of a download data into a pdf from a folder on a server that I don’t own or have access to the file system. I can only get the data using API calls and I want each “discovered file” to be processed in its own thread. 
you could maybe use the filesystemwatcher class combined with threadpooling. So when the filesystemwatcher.created event is fired it adds the file to the threadpool. threadpool example: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.threadpool.queueuserworkitem?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.threadpool.queueuserworkitem?view=netframework-4.7.2) &amp;#x200B; filesystemwatcher example: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.7.2) &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps you out
You know why? It's because it still makes money, a lot of developers forget that that's the point of their code, to make money for the company they work for (most of the time)
Thank you for your reply! Will the threadpool automatically free up resources at the completion of the thread, or do I need to work on garbage collection? 
To elaborate on existing answers, your problem here is your understanding of the scope of your variable. In your code snippet you declare a bool named invalidPrint within a conditional. That bool is born, lives, and dies within those curly braces. Declaring it outside of the conditionals is how you would still be able to access it. bool isInvalidPrintingEnabled = false; if(blah == blah blah) { isInvalidPrintingEnabled = true; } Later you'll learn that this can be achieved in one line but that isn't important right now. Happy coding.
&gt;ork on garbage collection? No the GC should take care of it, unless you are doing some special stuff with unmanaged memory. But i guess thats not the case. 
Two things... First, once you write Thread.Start, your writing legacy code. When it comes to managing threads yourself or using the TPL, the TPL wins 999 times out of 1000. You need a really good reason to be doing your own threads and you need to really know what your doing. Second, there's no reason to monitor the folder yourself, the FileSystemWatcher will do exactly what you need. [Here's a tutorial](https://www.dotnetperls.com/filesystemwatcher) to get you up and running, but it's not complicated to use.
If you’re making http calls to an API then you need to rephrase your question cause you’re not monitoring a folder for a file at that point. That’s why everyone is suggesting file watcher.

Scopes my friend. Scopes...
I would recommend checking out sites like Pluralsight as well. Books are good too but having a professional walk you through material really helped me. 
I thought OP was buying magic mushrooms cause wtf there is no "mushroom" in a super market, there are types of mushrooms sold by weight so each type and even "brand" has its own. So the answer doens't seem to help at all. Which mushroom? How much of it for a dollar?
I found this threadpool example which has helped me. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction! https://owlcation.com/stem/C-ThreadPool-and-its-Task-Queue-Example
Thanks, will try with this approach. :) 
Gotta start from the bottom, I guess. :p
My apologies! I found this article that has helped me accomplish what I needed: https://owlcation.com/stem/C-ThreadPool-and-its-Task-Queue-Example Thank you for your help! FSW looks very interesting and I know I can use it in another project I’m working on. 
If were are limiting ourselves to features you have already used, you can either add a loop around each question that checks if it was answered correctly, or you can keep track of what question you are on and use if statements to handle each case. Glad to see you are enjoying the subject.
I’m going to use Threadpooling. Thank you so much for your help and links!
This would also be a good case for a do/while loop. do { Console.WriteLine("Please enter a number"); num1 = ValidateInteger(Console.ReadLine()); } while(num1 &lt;= 0)
Oh yes, i just wanted to show off that you can separate the loops easily
You could also look into using reactive extensions to create an interval observable. https://rehansaeed.com/reactive-extensions-part4-replacing-timers/
Actually it because you can only buy a 227g box of "normal" whites mushrooms : https://www.provigo.ca/Alimentation/Fruits-et-légumes/Légumes/Champignons-et-truffes/Champignons-de-paris/p/20751829_EA
I am not an expert on security, but i think this would be possible. See this link: [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14505/can-i-trust-the-source-ip-of-an-http-request](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14505/can-i-trust-the-source-ip-of-an-http-request) However if your website contains any personal information from user. i would recommend using a real auth system.
Threadpooling is still essentially working with the old threading model. [Microsoft's recommendation is to use the TPL for threading work.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) Even with using a threadpool, there are low level details that you will need to be aware of in order to implement that code properly. I'd recommend you try and find a solution using the TPL before working with the thread pool.
yeah, I forgot that provigo is only located in Canada. Sorry hey? 
Yes, I'm indeed a French Canadian. So no English is not my 1st language 
Do you have a repo somewhere? I'd like to see this
What do you mean? 
Do you have the source code for this bot on GitHub or something public? I'm interested in how this works
Sadly not yet, because I'm still adding small things and fixing bugs. But the CheckPrice command was the main goal of this bot. When it done I'll be more than happy to share the code
Besides that, you're creating a new Label, which will be created with all default values. You might have to set some properties like coordinates.
I'll Pm you when I do
Appreciated!
Use MEF or another extensibility framework.
Ahh yes, I think I remember you posting this here a while back. Thanks for reminding me. As it happens I have a need for a client RabbitMQ API so will take a look at this sometime soon.
You're gonna need to use Microsoft's Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). Add a reference to `System.ComponentModel.Composition` (this is MEF's core). You'll use a `DirectoryCatalog` to load all assemblies in a specific directory dynamically. You'll then use a `CompositionContainer` with that catalog to dynamically create instances of all types that implement the interface you specify.
Je serais aussi intéressé à y jeter un coup d'oeil (et à l'utiliser pour mon propre Provigo!), merci de m'informer de la disponibilité du GitHub aussi!
Pas de problème 
You don't *need* to use MEF, but it was designed to do a lot of the heavy lifting here. I'll walk through what you'd have to do if you don't adopt it, then you can decide. Without MEF, your first step will be to define a set of interfaces, abstract classes, etc. that the plugin writers will implement. You can only write C# code in terms of classes you reference at compile time, so if you don't define these interfaces your life will be *very* miserable. So let's say your plugins just exist to show a dialog box. You'd write `IDialogBoxDisplay` with a `ShowDialog()` method. The end. Put that in a library and publish it so plugin writers can reference it. Then you have to write the part of your code that loads plugins. Let's say you want to automagically load all things that display dialogs in the user's plugin assembly. To get there, you have to write Reflection code. This is complex, and can't be checked by the compiler, so you want to write as little of it as possible (which is why you published the interface before!) You start with `Assembly.Load()`, giving it the path of a DLL you think is a plugin. That gives you an `Assembly` object. You can query that for its types with a method that's probably called `GetTypes()` (I'm not double-checking!). Now you have some work. You have to inspect each type to see if it's a public instance type that implements `IDialogBoxDisplay`. That takes some other various methods implemented on `Type` and/or `TypeInfo`. Once you find a type that is probably an implementation, you have to create an instance of it. How? Well, an interface doesn't define a constructor, so we have to guess. You can call `Type.GetConstructors()` to see if it has any public constructors you know how to call. If so, you need to provide arguments to a `ConstructorInfo.Invoke()` call. That'll return an `object` you can cast to `IDialogBoxDisplay`, and now you can write your plugin code. MEF does a lot of that dirty work for you. It's usually a lot better to just roll with that.
I've done this in the past with reflection but I'll have to explore MEF - it sounds much more purpose built for this.
Next challenge - Create a Discord bot that doesn't require a Discord API Key :D
Since all available binary serializers in existence are a huge disappointment for me, I made my own: [https://github.com/rikimaru0345/Ceras](https://github.com/rikimaru0345/Ceras) &amp;#x200B; \- Very fast \- Polymorphic serialization of any kind \- Fully supports "reference loops" (objects referencing each other in any way) \- Does pretty much anything you can imagine when it comes to a binary serializer (and more). So **many** more features... &amp;#x200B; At the moment I'm improving (pretty much rebuilding from the ground up) the version-tolerance feature. Version tolerance means that you can still load old data even if you add/remove/rename a field in your class. &amp;#x200B; The project is pretty young but it already works really well. It'd be great to have a few more contributors :) &amp;#x200B;
The "pro" manner with old .NET is COM. (I would expect that writing COM servers isn't in .NET Core but didn't look). MEF is OK. Loading an assembly yourself and instantiating a type from it is a bit of a kludge, but works fine.
Oh fantastic, hit me up if you need any features or run into issues. I can do you a release in relatively a few minutes - 5~15 minutes for the NuGets to show up. A coworker started using at work and was very surprised it was so performant. Our current internal solution is a bit of a hybrid mess that supports multiple MQ protocols.
Schemes like this can be vulnerable if: - An attacker finds an SSRF vulnerability in software on the same machine (e.g. XXE) - Your app's [middleware configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer) was changed in an incorrect way, allowing an attacker to spoof the remote IP address Of course neither of those *should* be the case and there may be additional limitations on the attack (e.g. GET vs POST), but it's something to keep in mind.
Yes you want to use Tasks. My suggestion is an Infinite Loop asynchronous Task loop to check for work. Then use an ActionBlock to one UnitOfWork with the DoWork functionality. ActionBlocks are parallel, but with control and the ability to do asynchronous work, without you having to deal with "Threads". The Async infinite loop basically consists of a while (true) { try { await ScheduleWorkAsync();} catch { HandleError(); } await Task.Delay(x); // Time to wait between checks. } Assign the above task to a static object in memory and voila, you have an asynchronous action being performed with x seconds between tasks. ActionBlocks operate very similar to ConcurrentQueues. Here you can learn about ActionBlocks from the DataFlow library here: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/09/introduction-to-dataflow-part-1.html https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.dataflow.actionblock-1?view=netcore-2.2
I wish i'd known about this, i built something very similar to it. The only thing that MEF can't do is support CSharpScript, which is only because the compiled assembly isn't directly accessible. Guess i'll be switching over soon then!
I think it’s a valid distinction to make because almost no one talks about c# as an isolated language. If someone talks about c#, there’s a 95% chance that theyre talking about C#.NET, with all of the cool standard libraries and .NET features. Since “C#” has become analogous to C#.NET, it’s worthwhile to distinguish vanilla c# somehow 
Thanks, indeed from that conversation it seems ok. As I do not plan to stock any users informations, the only thing open would be creating and editing news.
If your compiled assembly results in an `Assembly` object, you can put that object it in an `AssemblyCatalog` instead. What I like to do is create an `AggregateCatalog` which is just a collection of catalogs that you can pass into the composition container. This way, you can use multiple catalogs together like the directory and assembly catalogs.
Worst case the attacker would only be able to create or edit news, nothing that is not already publicly available would be exposed. Maybe I'll try to look into some sort of js cleaner to remove any script from the news item created so no one can add malicious code.
&gt; Threadpooling is still essentially working with the old threading model. Tasks use the threadpool to schedule work. The threadpool was rewritten to support this, it’s not legacy or the old model. That said, Tasks are generally easier and more flexible to work with. 
&gt; First, once you write Thread.Start, your writing legacy code. Naa, just lower level code. It has its uses. &gt; You need a really good reason to be doing your own threads Sure. &gt; and you need to really know what your doing. Really? They are a pretty simple concept. Simpler than some of the things tasks can do.
CSharpScript does produce an Assembly but you can't get it directly, not unless you return it from the script. Your use case for aggregating catalogs should be possible by creating a custom catalog class that can do just that.
There was silverlight, but there is still actually something called XBAP for WPF in browser. It is a full WPF program, but it’s only supported by IE
They’ve been soft deprecated for a long time. The core code hasn’t really changed much since I was first created, so it doesn’t scale well with new tech like GPU rendering or high DPI monitors. Its fine for quick business apps that you build in a few days, but not suggested for any other new development 
Does anyone else ever write code with nothing but dynamic objects and anonymous class instances? I find strongly typed code too restrictive
"Latest minor" is what you're looking for. Rider should suggest it if you try to use any new features. 
Latest minor is the same as 7.1, sadly... When it shows me an error with "C# 7.2 Language Feature", it gives me option to "Set C# language level to '7.2' for code analysis of this project (doesn't affect build)"...
You can alternatively edit the csproj directly and the the language version. If MSBuild isn't catching the right language version, it might be outdated. 
Tried it before -- it gave some error it's not supported despite I downloaded it from a post saying about new C# 7.2 features
Why would COM be considered the "pro" manner?
Ahh nice and I will do if needed. Keep up the good work. 
Last time I checked, \`new T()\` with \`new\` constraint will still compile to \` Activator.CreateInstance() \`. but at least \`new T()\` is checked at compile time.
Maybe you would enjoy F# more, where the type inference will make it feel not strongly typed, but you won't suffer run time performance penalty because it actually is statically typed at compile time. 
Btw, this is content for support ticket, not for reddit
I would discourage you from coupling your database design so tightly with your website layout. Name your objects for what they are. They're not menu categories, because these columns can and will be used outside of that context. You have a Product and a TargetMarket. The relationship between those two things should simply be a ProductCategory and will probably have a "Description" column that isn't always a concatenation like "Women's socks". For your later problem, a dictionary is probably the easiest thing to work with public class NavigationBarCategories { public Dictionary&lt;int,ICollection&lt;Product&gt;&gt; CategoriesByProductCategoryId {get;set;} } then you can write a simple foreach that appends or creates the right dictionary entries. 
Alright but what if your attacker creates news with some JavaScript injected? Then the list of possible attacks is pretty much unlimited. You can never "not handle security" and honestly being "lazy" regarding security is the last thing you should aim to be. Whether this is a small project you're writing to learn stuff or something that will actually be used, don't do this. There are multiple frameworks that can handle this for you. Also, try and test it when your web app is on a different network I'm not 100% sure it works. 
We use MEF at work but I have to be honest, the lead dev decided we should do this and he implemented the boilerplate for that (because we use MEF with Unity and there was a bunch of stuff to do regarding container registration etc). I followed what he was doing but honestly I still don't really get what problem exactly MEF is supposed to solve. Like, our projects have references to other projects in the solution anyway, why the hell is MEF useful?? what does it even do!
To add one small thing to this, it may be a good idea to define a uniform factory interface that handles creation of the IDialogBoxDisplay object. This would require the plugin developers to implement the object creation through the factory and remove guesswork of random implementation constructors. This is also where you would define any data that is universally needed by the various plugins (as params of the factory “Create” method call).
Can’t you compile to an exe though?
__DIR__ "/" . $username 
Using MEF, I could simply create a new type that inherits from an exported base class (using the `InheritedExportAttribute`) and *it would automatically be picked up by the program during runtime*. That's just an example. Also, you don't need hard-coded assembly references -- all you need to do is load the assembly dynamically during runtime, add it to an aggregate catalog, and boom -- you can now resolve types from it. It has IoC behavior.
that changes the error to: ( ! ) Warning: fopen(C:\\wamp64\\www\\EX1\\public/Jordan.txt): failed to open stream: File exists in C:\\wamp64\\www\\EX1\\public\\Process\_RoomRequest.php on line *23* Unable to open file 
The point behind CSharpScript is that you can compile C# source code into a script that you can then execute, and interact with the code directly. Executables can't do that.
I've tried web scraping with C# in the past, but haven't gotten it to work properly. Whenever I web scraped in the past I always used Python. I'd love to know how you got it working.
My use case for it is third party plugins. A 3D model viewer that can load extensions without needing to recompile it is very useful.
NET Core doesn't support COM at this time.
Maybe someday, idk how but I'll try someday 
You probably don't the proper permissions to write in that folder. In any case, why is this here in the C# sub?
I was like "When did those guys make C# like this?" then I saw php.
Yup, MEF is key. We used it for a WPF app to dynamically load tools across a broad set of corporate users. Worked like a charm. 
I'm suspecting someone hasn't done their study :) What's the "entry point" of a C# application?
If you're working on a visual studio solution then I'd go on the properties then debug. From there you should see command line arguments where you can out your args[0] and args[1] in.
There’s no cheating in programming. The lack of response is due to obvious fact that you are trying the join a marathon before you can even sit up straight, let alone crawl, walk or run. Put in the time and effort to learn the basics and show that you have done so and I’m sure people will jump to help you along the way.
Now do it for software that doesn't threaten your privacy instead!
That's precisely why I said I was going to look into removing script from sent data ^^" As for the lazy part, yeah that's why I am here asking if my solution is still secure, of course I don't want to be open to vulnerabilities. Maybe I'll add new pages by hand instead of using some interface if this prove to risky. It was mostly to play around with razor pages to see what has changed in the web world.
Well for example, I worked at a company where the software needed to be slightly different per client. So we started a "core" product and allowed our client dev teams to develop separate class libraries for the client specific needs. Such as business rules, etc. Plug and play. MEF is great for SoC and is very flexible
At first, there is no Visual Studio 2018. If you want to learn C# and become a real programmer you should read books and watch videos. Both are effective but if you do both you'll learn easily. When you learn the basics, move to the more complex stuff such as WinForms, WPF, Database stuff etc. Also, you should learn how to use System libraries such as [System.Data](https://System.Data), System.Xml etc. Hope you become a good programmer! BTW make sure you write code often so you won't forget stuff! Gave a good night because it is 2 AM!
Just curious, are your machines not connected to a domain? AD has this functionality built in. Did a quick Google search, have you looked at [this? ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2266797/how-to-apply-windows-group-policy-using-net)
Wow. If that’s true. And I’ll assume it is until I hear otherwise. Then they’re using the term compute a bit too loosely
Sorry I didn't explain it clear enough. At my company we work with application packaging technology we offer training to allow our end users to package applications for their university systems. So were not on their network at all. Anyways long story short we advise our users to begin packaging on a completly clean machine. I'll list some of the settings below: * Disable updates * Disable cortana * Disable one drive/ uninstall it * Disable power saving * Disable a few misc services * Etc.... Our customers tend to ignore this and attempt to package on machines are not configured to our reccomendations which causes allot of issues. So my application is to be downloaded by the end user. By default it is set to put down all our reccomended settings but gives the user to overide these options if they want to by unchecking checkboxes. Disabling services etc is all simple I'm just strugling with the LGP settings. And yes I have looked at that suggestion you made yesterday saddly it didn't help. 
I'd recommend you find a good course and follow along. I'd recommend this tutorial series on udemy\* to get started: [https://www.udemy.com/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners/](https://www.udemy.com/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners/) I haven't followed this course myself, but I have followed a lot of courses by the same person and they're all pretty darn good. Both easy to follow and he not only shows you the "how" but also explains the "why". &amp;#x200B; **(\*never buy anything on udemy unless there's a sale going on)**
Thanks for answering, I actually have visual studio 2017, thanks for pointing that, I'll do my best to write code often.
Let's say I have a WPF app, Window with some navigation buttons on the left. This is installed on your computer. With MEF I could make a new, separate project with some new features, let you download only that library and add it to the installation folder, and automatically the app would pick it up at runtime, display a new navigation button etc, no re-install required. Drop a file into a folder - poof! new features. That's neat.
I just meant as a way to hook it into a plugin architecture. But I see how the general philosophy difference doesn’t really let that make sense. 
Been using MEF for years works great. There is another official Microsoft solution called Unity that's heavily used in AspNet Core. 
I'm still a programming novice but I found a decent start with Microsoft Virtual Academy. Something that works for me and retains my enthusiasm is to learn by doing projects. Find or think of something that you would like to make that fits your skill level, then research how to do it as you go along. I find that 90% of the time, I end up finding the answer on Stackoverflow. It is my absolute go-to for finding answers to problems big or small.
Try stashing the context accessor in your constructor, instead of calling the user id method, then in your action use the local ref to the context accessor to make the ID call.
Well, it doesn't look like you're ever updating anything. &amp;#x200B; You gotta take the values you get back from the view and update your model with them: var result = //Get the record from your Db. if (result != null) { result.FirstName= "Some new value from your ViewModel"; db.SaveChanges(); } &amp;#x200B; Let me know if that works for you!
Thx for your reply, I'm trying it now. However, I can't seem to find out how I call a value from my viewmodel as you mentioned here: \` result.FirstName= "Some new value from your ViewModel"; \`
I would seriously weigh the cost benefit. I know it sounds like a cool thing to write, but generally the simple solution is the best e.g. just redeploy each time you make changes. Ive worked on a system that did this, I deleted a lot of code and we just redeployed when ever it was needed.
How exactly is this different than \`GCHandle\`?
Just trying to understand more clearly so you have one WebAPI that's issuing the JWT token and you're now trying to make another WebAPI also use it?
You can't take the address of a GCHandle that's isn't of type pinned, and you can't pin a class with a GCHandle (only structs of blittable types can be pinned with a GChandle)
I'm using Denis Panjutas " #### [Complete C\# MasterClass](https://www.udemy.com/complete-csharp-masterclass/)". It's £9.99 on Udemy at the moment. The only thing I would say about it is once you're a few sections in try experimenting with creating things yourself before you progress. Let things make sense to you rather than just powering through the course, as it moves pretty quickly through the sections, and by halfway through it I felt a little lost. That's mostly my own fault though as I was watching the videos at 2x speed and following along, and quickly moving to the next section. There are lots of good tutorials on youtube too, as long as there's a plan you'll do fine.
While books and courses are certainly of value, I have found that there is no substitute for plenty of practice. Try things. Modify examples to do other things. Make mistakes and figure out what you did wrong. Be an actual programmer, in other words
If you don't give any considerations to security, it will get compromised in ways you didn't expect, including "what actually gets sent to the client". Let's say that someone takes over the admin page, then exploits an XSS vulnerability in your story publishing code. Boom, you are distributing scripts. Or, even better, they find a way to pull off a SQL injection attack and create articles containing arbitrary javascript or base64 encoded content of varying legality. 
I have one WebApi that is issuing the JWT token, and in the other I'm not sure if I wan't to use the JWT token directly. My idea was that if the HttpContext has the UserIdentity I would assume that the current user is authenticated. And access i.e. the authenticated user's Id by querying the HttpContext UserIdentity in the other WebApi. But are the different WebApi's operating on different HttpContexts? 
You can buy full courses on Udemy.com if you want something structured. There is also Pluralsight.com, and you can find free three month trials. Good quality stuff there too. Theres also stuff on youtube. Quality can be iffy though! Books are good. But videos hold your hand a bit more. Let's see if you can knock together a little console app. It'll look like CMD in windows. Do a calculator, or maybe something will tell if today is Christmas. Get visual studio up, and the code in front of you. Start typing shit, and fuck around. Visual Studio also has plugins and extensions. There's one called [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), it's brilliant and really helps out by suggesting lots of stuff and pointing out lots of errors. It's got a 30 day trial, it basically taught me C#. Just abuse the trial for a while. 
Oh! In your controller do this: [HttpPost] public ActionResult Wijzigen(ModelType model) Your model should bind automatically.
right, but obviously this library would have to adhere to a particular interface right? And it would have to replace an already existing library? And if your code uses a library replaced by a new one, how does it know to pick that particular class if you've specified anothet one in your code?
Removed: Rule 3. Try /r/PHPhelp
Removed: Rule 4. There are resources in the sidebar, sticky. Dive in at /r/learnprogramming, tonnes of help resources there.
Saw your additional info. I assumed HttpContext UserIdentiy would have some magic sauce that would make it possible to get the data. Could you elaborate a little more on the wiring up the second api's JWT. I guess it would involve copying the // configure jwt authentication part in the startup.cs. But then I see that it's referring to var user = userService.GetById(userId); where I don't have a reference to userService, becuase I'm currently in a different WebApi project.
If you are new to programming you need an introductory course. 10-15 years ago one of our employees found Murach’s to be a good resource. At least I think that was it. The most recent one for C# is Murach's C# 2015 https://www.amazon.com/dp/1890774944/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_DPvmCbWD614RB As for video courses don't rule out Pluralsight.com if that is an option. 
What's really funny is that strings are no longer immutable: string str = "Hello World!"; string str2 = "Hello World!"; var span = MemoryMarshal.CreateSpan(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(str.AsSpan()), str.Length); span[0] = 'J'; Console.WriteLine(str); Console.WriteLine(str2); str is written to because obviously I'm taking the reference. However, str2 is also written to because the C# does string interning - it caches strings and assigns the same addresses.
I'm not sure what I exactly have to add there... I'm kinda new to this. But whenever I add \[HttpPost\] it gives me a server error that it can't find the url /Home/Wijzigen. I now have this: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Yes, they don't share HttpContext's -- they are unique per web application. The code below is the magic sauce that populates the HttpContext.User variable. .AddJwtBearer(x =&gt; { x.Events = new JwtBearerEvents { OnTokenValidated = context =&gt; { var userService = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService&lt;IUserService&gt;(); var userId = int.Parse(context.Principal.Identity.Name); var user = userService.GetById(userId); if (user == null) { // return unauthorized if user no longer exists context.Fail("Unauthorized"); } return Task.CompletedTask; } }; x.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; x.SaveToken = true; x.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true, IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(key), ValidateIssuer = false, ValidateAudience = false }; });
I’ve had success with HtmlAgilityPack but yeah Python has better packages.
Ah, so you need another controller action there. Add this above your other one: [HttpGet] public ActionResult Wijzigen(UserInfo UserInfo) { return View("EigenGegevens", "Home"); } Basically, when you submit data to a controller you are doing an Http Post, and when you are first going to the page you are doing an Http Get.
In the first web api, you can comment out the OnTokenValidated piece, that's really only doing a user check, I'm not really sure it needs to pull more user data to actually do that... could change it to something like this: OnTokenValidated = context =&gt; { var principal = context.Principal; if (principal == null) { // return unauthorized if user no longer exists context.Fail("Unauthorized"); } return Task.CompletedTask; }
Isn't that against TOS?
I think pdfsharp has tons of examples if you just search what you’re trying to accomplish 
Delicious.
I could be mistaken here, but it seems like this isn't really a question of Group Policy, it's just Windows settings. In other words, I would look at each setting and find the Win32 API call for it, as opposed to thinking in terms of gpedit. Another suggestion- this might be a job better performed by a Powershell script. Microsoft is really trying to make it the sysadmin tool to use.
I tried it but I already added a wijzigen function, I did not have both the HttpPost and HttpGet so that's definitely an issue. I also send you a private message 
You don't really need C#7.3/`GetPinnableReference()` for this, you could always do this via the `Unsafe` package (or `StructLayout` shenanigans). Also, I'm semi-sure you can avoid the race condition between `AsPointer` and `fixed` with an intermediate pin by reinterpreting the object as another type containing a pinnable field: class PinnableObject { public byte Pinnable; } object unpinnable = new Foo(); var pinnable = Unsafe.As&lt;object, PinnableObject&gt;(ref unpinnable); fixed (void* ptr = &amp;pinnable.Pinnable) { // Foo is now pinned }
Yes to the interface, but there doesn't have to be a library it replaces. You could implement it such that the plugin replaces a default library, but you could also design the application such that it's just some common core and the chosen plugin(s) provide all implementation or design it such that plugins are composed to provide cumulative functionality or all of the above. It's all about what your use case is and in how you design the application. You tell it how to work. For choosing the right implementation class, look into dependency injection for one such strategy.
How does this work with intelliSense?
If I understand what you're trying to do, it looks like you're used to console applications. The program won't wait for the listbox selection. Which make sense because there are probably other controls on the screen. The correct way to do this would not use a loop. You would create an event handler for the onSelectionChange event. This function gets called every time the selection changes. 
Yeah lol. I've been using c++ console for a while. Decided to create the same program on c# Windows form to make my portfolio look better. Oh, I'm not sure what an event handler is. Do you know where I can learn that from?
Thanks a lot for the help. I look forward to implement your suggestions!
I just have to know... what would be the difference between checking an item once or twice?
I'm actually a bit surprised .NET doesn't load literal strings into read-only memory. I guess if you believe your type system is properly safe, it doesn't actually matter.
Flow is like this: 1. Hit HTTPGET Action that takes in what it needs to build the model and returns the View 2. User receives View (page) that contains model bound to a &lt;form&gt; element with the “action” attribute the route to your HTTPPOST Action 3. User modifies element(s) and hits submit 4. Hits HTTPPOST Action that takes in the model. You update the data, and return the View with a model with updated data. There’s other ways to do it, such as JavaScript form submittal or partial views and what not but the most basic functionality would be like that.
As far as I know this can't be done in WPF, but can be done at the OS level. Here's how I set it up so that sublime text 2 opens up my text files: Open up an administrator command prompt. Type "ftype txtfile" without the quotes. Take note of what it says, in case it doesn't work and you need to set it back. Type in "ftype txtfile=&lt;path to your executable&gt; %1" without quotes again (if your file path has spaces in it, you should put them in quotes). Should be all that you need to do.
In Windows 10, find a .txt file. Right-click then select Open With..., then choose Choose another app. Navigate to your exe then check the "Always use this app to open files of this type" checkbox. Alternatively, open the registry editor, find .txt under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and change the ShellNew value to point to your app. 
I write API wrappers for cryptocurrency exchanges, focusing on the Canadian market exclusively. A bit niche, I admit, but I was hoping to make a bit of profit via referrals. I'm close to 2000 downloads via NuGet since I started 10 months ago, but unfortunately not a single referral yet: [https://www.nuget.org/profiles/rob\_johnston](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/rob_johnston) [https://github.com/RobJohnston](https://github.com/RobJohnston)
No problem. I just happened to do something similar at work recently. I am not 100% sure what you're trying to do but you might want to look into IdentityServer (https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) Essentially, IdentityServer is another WebAPI project that you would include in your solution which acts as the "Identity/User" api, you configure your two other WebAPI's to use that IdentityServer. The flow would then be your users or clients authenticate against the IdentityServer and then the two webapis will consume/use the authentication issued by the IdentityServer. It's a bit more advanced but does a lot of what you're trying to do. Here's a link to the samples, you're probably looking at #1 or #2 https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Samples/tree/master/Quickstarts
Yes, bypassing the bot authentication system to programmatically control discord in any way, including making a custom discord client or modifying the official client is strictly against ToS
i tried the top bit, didnt work.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/index In it's simplest form, an event is a function of an object that's executed during a certain action/behavior. So in a console program, it can really only do one thing, run, so you get one "event", the main loop, however in UI development, a list box for instance can do many things, these things are driven by events that you hook into. So one of the things you can do with a list box is click on various items, so there will be an event that handles item clicks or at least something that lets you do that. 
I used HtmlAgilityPack
Please don’t do this. Depending on what other features you’re using, you can crash the runtime.
If you really want to confuse people, print the string literal directly after you modify the memory. This is an old example I've had kicking around for a few years. It uses `unsafe` and raw pointers but is easily done with spans and other new low-level features: var str = "Strings are immutable!"; fixed( char* c = str ) { for( var i = 14; i &lt; str.Length; ++i ) c[i - 2] = Char.ToUpper( c[i] ); c[str.Length - 1] = default( char ); c[str.Length - 2] = default( char ); } Console.WriteLine( "Strings are immutable!" ); Output: Strings are MUTABLE! Even more fun, the NUL chars still count toward the string's length, so even though the new string is only 20 chars, the `Length` property still reports that it's 22 chars.
Let me know as well!
It would be for toggling 2 properties of something. A good analogy would be if you had a list of devices, each device could have bluetooth on or off, and wifi on or off. So one column of boxes would be 'bluetooth' and the other would be 'wifi'. They could both be checked, one or the other, or neither.
Don’t tell me how to live!!!
&gt;Even more fun, the NUL chars still count toward the string's length, so even though the new string is only 20 chars, the `Length` property still reports that it's 22 chars. That can be solved, too: ((int*)c)[-1] -= 2;
&gt; &lt;input type="button" value="Save" onclick="location.href='@Url.Action("Wijzigen", "Home")'" /&gt; I'm not really a web dev but doesn't this just send you to the homepage? It doesn't submit the form at all. I think you need to wrap your form with @using(Html.BeginForm()) { [...] } instead of `&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;` And then your save button does: &lt;input type="submit" value="Save" /&gt; This will post to `Wijzigen` with the model (your inputs) and your `Wijzigen` method in the controller (that you posted above) will redirect to `EigenGegevens` once it's done saving.
Check out rotativa. If you can create an mvc page, you can create a PDF. Rotativa captures the page and makes a PDF of it. I needed to generate a ton of PDFs, all essentially rows and columns of data. I made a generic page that can be fed a data table, and used that to create all my PDFs.
I mean it gives you direct access to the computing processors of the gpu without going through the normal pipeline. Before compute shaders, you would have to treat data as textures and “render” your calculations with triangles. With compute shaders you can just spin up threads on a whim. Technically CUDA is exactly the same. Just because people made libraries for CUDA doesn’t mean the base level isn’t nearly identical for both. CUDA is just more direct because it was designed for general compute usage, while DirectCompute was meant to compliment Direct3D for general purpose algorithms that can help when rendering. Some people may have written shaders that do some of the things you want, but in the end, both are low level APIs where the user is supposed to code them appropriately, not as high level programs designed to process images or anything. It is like writing a program to process images in C++ versus using an image analysis program.
The thread pool is not a replacement for creating your own threads. Some things require STA threads, but the thread pool threads are all MTA. You also shouldn't use the thread pool for long running operations because it's not designed for that. For long running operations, create your own threads to avoid slowing down your app whilst the thread pool tries to figure out if it's going to get its threads back to run more work.
Because * it allows users to write their modules in many more languages * it provides process isolation through Component Services (so a misbehaving module crashes without taking the caller down) * it provides more deployment options (related to previous) I guess I am downvited because I said COM. Yeah, .NET people are afraid of it, but that's a poor reason. It's absolutely the very good answer to the question.
You're using a loop inside a method, and that method is basically (the way I see it here) the entire program. Why not use an entire class to make the program (keep the variables for life total and damage and so on in the class), and then use the method for one thing, and one thing only: If the button gets pressed, see what option is selected, and act accordingly (so do damage or heal or whatever). 
Yeah, ok. Many people said "MEF", that's not in Core either, I think?
I forgot to mention that I'm using WPF, but I'll check it out anyway. Thanks.
Any reason to not use a data grid with checkbox columns? 
While I don’t know everything you are trying to accomplish, I would use Google to find the Registry key associated with each group policy you are interested in and just modify those keys via a batch script, program, service, etc. I’ve had really good success hunting down most things with a few Google searches. If any machines are bound to domains where they have a conflicting policy to what you want, using a service to override these settings on a timer or when group policy is applied is possible. Most Registry changes tied to group policy take effect immediately, but you may need to be careful on the select few that require restart or sign out/sign in.
Try having another thread that is basically a while loop checking for messages. You can fire off a Message event or something like that when you have a message
Damn that's dirty. Amazing.
It's all because MemoryMarshal is very powerful and can actually used to do some very cool, fast, and wildly unsafe things. For example, you can reinterpret spans of one type as a span of another type, without the need for any copy or type checking. And creating a Span from a ReadOnlySpan, like you just did.
Intresting! There is some visual tool in studio when you use a database, showing a diagram over all tables. Should even be able to generate the classes from adjusting the diagram itself. Other than that no clue, Good luck.
/u/xampl9's post is the correct answer. When you say you tried it and it didn't wok, what exactly happens? You may need to supply screenshots of what you did so we can figure out why it didn't work.
They have never truly been read-only. Modification was possible for a long time already.
Udemy without sales is just a bad scam
I wish they'd fleshed out that part a bit more tbh - functions to cast Span&lt;byte&gt; to Span&lt;int&gt; (or vice versa) with defined endianness would have been great (w/ the caveat that copies are performed if the cast cannot be performed / wrong endian). My other greviance… I often want to return small tuples from functions, where arity is not known at compile-time (instance I'm thinking of is abstract method of a base class). For this, 0 or 1 elements covers 95% of cases, but every now and then I need to return 2 (rarely 3), but AFAIK there's no way to achieve the common case without dynamic allocation. Inline, stackalloc can be used, but of course these cannot be returned. The performance cost is negligible, but cheap variable length returns via Span&lt;&gt; would have been nice.
Oh. Had similar issue but ui thread needed to be updated based on background thread. So the basic principal is push details in to a stack his case an action delegate and have asynchronous thread or timer update if stack count greater than 0 then Pop off stack update push to dispatcher and repeat via call back to start new thread waiting for a condition or just periodically on a timer. Finally add a hook for app shutdown to complete any outstanding operations. And if you get an exception just push the delegate back on the stack to try again x amount of times. No lag on anything and beside exceptions everything is processed in order. One step better I replaced the idea of bindings with a heap that updated anything with a matching guid in a static dictionary of types and objects. So any background data on any component was updated on any ui component or other class. And it also worked the other way ui would update data and you can add update lag to reduce multiple writes to the actual persistent data 
[AutoSetup](https://github.com/tukaya/autosetup): auto generate mocks for class under test &amp;#x200B; I usually write the tests before the implementation. Nevertheless, sometimes it works more efficiently to make changes to code first and then adjust the tests. I have observed that most of my colleagues take this approach as well. Current tools do not make it easier. To save time from the manual labor of re-typing the mocks, I have come up with this solution. &amp;#x200B; Autosetup finds the class under test from within the solution and updates the mocks as well as the test setup method. Suggestions and contributions are welcome. [https://github.com/tukaya/autosetup](https://github.com/tukaya/autosetup)
Maybe if there was a method on `Span&lt;T&gt;` like `ReinterpretSpan&lt;AnotherType&gt;()` that could do a full JIT accelerated reinterpret cast for value types, but provide a little more safety than memory marshal? Also, returning Spans would be pretty nice, but I'm not sure how the compiler could do it with variable length spans - it kinda has to know how much to allocate on the stack frame before allocating the frame for the next function. 
The assembly load rout is good. Mef not required at all. To make it easy for everyone create a simply library with implimentations So the guts of any thing you want to access or allow access to is easy. But all that said and done I saw a post siggesting avoid it and they are right plugins are a pain in the butt. And always k.i.s.s keep it simple silly. I spent ages putting in plugin support to something I ultimately nixed because it simply wasn't required and all I end up doing was restriction my options.
Mostly, I was looking for a way to do the common case of length 1 without allocation. I thought on the introduction of Spans that perhaps they could point to a value, in which case this would be easy, but as far as I can see they cannot. That is, I was not opposed to returning a special `FlexTuple&lt;T&gt;` type, where the FlexTuple had a single element field _and_ a Span (either pointing to that field, or Empty, or to an Array), but you can't do it. Nor can you "stackalloc" an array within a struct (ie embed an array in a struct in C), not even with the stack-only `ref struct` which would appear to lend itself to such constructs. It was just one of those cases where it seemed.. unpolished or unfinished, the (at the time) beta feature I was trialling, which has not improved since.
Actually yeah, fixed length arrays as their own "type" makes a lot of sense, for returns and embedding within structs. I think C++ has had similar functionality for quite some time. I'm wondering if C# will focus on this now, given the heavy recent push towards high performance code.
What's the reason of the `new void Dispose()` method in the interface?
Span internally is \[very\] unsafe and uses some niche JIT intrinsics so it might require the permission level of unsafe code to be used anyway
Here's a fun one. Wanna cut down a string? Manually modify the length property instead of making an expensive copy with \`SubString()\` \[warning: highly stupid\]: &amp;#x200B; Add to your code above &amp;#x200B; \*((int\*)(c - 2)) = 7; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
You are declaring the integer inside the if/else condition. It can only be used locally. You should define it above and set the value inside the if/else. 
Don't pay attention to the additional brackets xD
Thanks a lot. I'll try that when I have time
none, I was planning on removing that but forgot
This isn’t really interning but rather compile time merging. Load-time string interning is possible but not performed in practice for performance reasons. 
In fact, StringBuilder used to be implemented with a String underneath that was modified using private API. 
I think i may have just thought of the worst bug in the history of mankind. String interning (which is why the effect above occurs) is across app domains. So this code &amp;#x200B; \`Console.WriteLine("Hello World");\`, which generates a \`ldstr\` opcode, which interns the string / checks for it, could print something \*completely\* different if the hello world string has been mutated by another process in the interning table. 
Sure, it's totally true. What I'm about to say is probably not very interesting for the most seasoned programming veterans, but I guess many people will still find it interesting. &amp;#x200B; So yeah taking a pointer and doing manipulations with it directly is one way to do this, but you can go a level deeper! You can use a debugger (VisualStudio, OllyDbg, CheatEngine, ...) to change stuff. That should be no surprise to anyone who ever used a debugger. But debuggers can change "readonly" memory as well. Well, at least the pages in ram that are marked as readonly, phsical read-only-memory on the other hand (better known as ROM, from CD-ROM, ...) can't be changed. &amp;#x200B; Or can it! Obviously one can physically change a ROM (doesn't matter if its a CD-ROM or some hardware chip that's made as a ROM by soldering it in the right way). &amp;#x200B; You probably know what I'm getting at, there's always a way to make a change you're not supposed to be able to make. And that's exactly the point, so let me put it in other words: &amp;#x200B; Once you leave the system (in this case the .NET type-system) its rules and limitations don't apply anymore. And it's precisely those rules and limitations that we want from any system or framework in the first place. Those rules (while constraining) give us something that's worth more: Which is reliability. As long as everyone plays by the rules the system can give us some assurances, which as it turns out, makes a lot of things much easier to deal with and reason about.
Which ones do you mean?
Just a quick remark but local variables should be declared in camelCamel to be easily differentiate with class properties 😉
And it sounds like you’re trying to declare the variable again after this if/else statement. 
Probably also fun: create completely incomprehensible errors in `dynamic` code by mutating reflection member names or interned strings equal to identifiers.
That's evil
If two separately-launched executables (but running simultaneously) utilise the same .NET DLLs, is the table shared?
You can bind SelectedIndex to a property of your ViewModel and change that accordingly
All processes share a common one that run on a CLR. I used 2 completely separate .NET core 2.1 apps. One referenced a a static field in the other, which invoked a static constructor. The static constructor then executed this code; string str = "Hello World!"; fixed (char* cPtr = str) { cPtr[0] = 'H'; cPtr[1] ,= 'i'; ((int*)cPtr)[-1] = 2; } Then the first assembly just did `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` It prints "Hi"
Yeah thats the route I have ended up going down. The only reason I wanted to edit LGP is because when we initially setup our systems we do it via gpedit.msc but your right that could cause conflicts on our end users machines as we don't know how they have them setup. I started googling commands and registry keys for the individual options I need putting in place as you suggested and so far I haven't been let down. So yeah I'll carry on and hopefully I manage to get everything in. Thanks man!
Cheers dude, yeah after reading your comment last night I decided to move away from trying to edit LGP directly via my app. I looked into Win32 API calls and managed to get a couple of settings in place so thanks for that suggestion. :) I am also using google to find key's and commands to put down settings I require opposed to trying to edit LGP directly which seems to be working out quite well. &amp;#x200B; And I have used a bit of powershell in the past and my company usually pushes us to use it for small scripts but personally am a major OOP fan boy and I've started working with C# about 3 months now and I am loving it! 
MEF is in Core. It's part of CoreFX: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx
Thank you! I tried using a class but I can't seen to access anything from form. It says it's restricted:(
Ah okay I see. Thank you
An interesting thing about this question is it is a common case where if statements being expressions would be handy. To make this work you have to declare your three variables outside the if statement, uninitialized, then be sure that you initialize them in your if statement. It is a bit ugly and you could forget. If you used F# for instance, you could say: let (TheLongSide,ShortSide1,ShortSide2) = if conditionA then (side1,side2,side) else if conditionB then (side2,side1,side3) else (side3,side1,side2) 
Create an int SelectedIndex property on your vm and bind TabControl.SelectedIndex to it.
Raw pointers is cheating, that's my point; you can do anything with them.
Oh dear. Wonder if the behaviour differs across operating systems.
Not sure about framework, but this was tested on Core which is cross platform
It sounds like you're missing the second half of this: /u/xampl9 has outlined the file association in Windows part. But you'll need to check the commands passed into your app when it's launched by Windows, to get the filename that's being passed to your app and then load / display the file in your own code. 
Without unsafe?
Interesting, sounds pretty intuitive actually for relational mapping @rymdragnar
Yeah, I just mean that it's possible .NET Core for Windows handles process memory differently to .NET Core for Linux - given that it's going to be outside of the realm of intended functionality.
The doc page for `string.Intern` says the CLR keeps interning across app domains so I'd say with reasonable confidence that the coreclr reflects that on other platforms
Maybe the access modifiers?
There’s methods on the UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; and/or RoleManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; to manage roles on existing users. I forget which one but if you examine the method signatures of those types you should be able to figure it out. Usually involves getting the IdentityUser first and then sending that in the method call with the Role Name.
Try a self signed cert?
&gt; self signed cert i know but this is in production am testing this on my local machine ?
or there is another way to use ssl with localhost, am new to c# ?
Don't do this as every modern browser out there will complain. Go with something like letsencrypt dot com. Proper certs with minimal hassle.
Are you using a web server (e.g. IIS or Apache) on your local machine? You need yo set up a either a self signed cert or a let's encrypt cert in the web server, then you can get SSL. 
I'd recommend to bind to `SelectedItem` instead of `SelectedIndex` as the index might be unstable if you allow to add or remove tabs (or reorder them). So in your viewmodel, you make a `CurrentItem` (or `SelectedItem`, or whichever name you like best) property and on the XAML side, you bind to it both way: ```xaml &lt;TabControl SelectedItem="{Binding Path=CurrentItem, Mode=TwoWay}"&gt; ... &lt;/TabControl&gt; ```
Removed: Rule 4. As others suggested, once you have the file association set, you have to handle the file path info provided to your application in startup: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/avip/2008/10/26/wpf-supporting-command-line-arguments-and-file-extensions/
So instead of downloading a 1k HTML file, you want me to download 14 mb of transpiled c#, parse it, compile it, and then run it... To produce 1k of output? This is what's wrong with the modern internet, not a step forward.
As others have pointed out, you can’t declare your variables inside the brackets and have them work outside the brackets. It’s a general scoping rule. Next, your casing for local varieties should be camelCase. Third, this code is quite verbose and probably contains incorrect logic. What if no side is longer than the other two? If we’re talking about Triangles, as I suspect we are, no side can be longer than the sum of the other two. There is a better method to this: var sides = new List&lt;int&gt; { side_1, side_2, side_3 }; sides.sort(); int longSide = sides[2]; int middleSide = sides[1]; int shortSide = sides[0]; if (longSide &gt; (shortSide + middleSide)) { // Do Things } else { // Handle other case }
This is neat and would love to tinker with it. Where can we find the source?
Use ngrok
I couldn't agree more. I see this at my work where people do not care about any metric of performance at all.
The CSharp source for the app will be up on GitHub later today. And the source for a full VisualStudio project that you can compile and test yourself should be available in a couple of days.
The C# transpiler runs on your local PC as part of a VisualStudio solution. The total size of the JavaScript uploaded to the server is about 3MB uncompressed. 
I like azures application insights. Was stupid easy to plug in and far better that elmah that we had before.
Uhhh... did you not bother to research anything before starting this project? Specifically... blazor and webassembly? https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2018/Jul/31/Web-Assembly-and-Blazor-Reassembling-the-Web
Look into implementations of OpenTracing. This is mostly plug and play and designed for what you’re trying to accomplish. It will track requests across microservices essentially by tagging the original request all the way down to the DB and back to the end user. Check out Instana for a C# support d implementation of OpenTracing. Outside OpenTracing: I’ve also used New Relic, Dynatrace and Correlsense. Have ELMAH on a few sites for simple error recording. Have not tried Azure’s Insights but may give that a shot for a comparison. Personally, I found Correlsense to work the best for my specific needs however their licensing gets exorbitantly expensive, and last I was using them they were using samples of all requests instead of full transactional recording. 
I went through this same thing. I took the database approach. To assign a role in the database there are three tables you use. AspNetRoles, AspNetUsers, and AspNetUserRoles. You take the ID of the role you want to apply from Roles and the ID of the User and enter them into UserRoles.
Is it possible to play a wave file direct from the memory? I make procedural music that I want to play from the memory instead of having to save the file.
This doesn’t seem like a replacement for HTML. It seems like just another abstraction. It also seems like this would be absolute hell to debug issues that occurred on the front end due to that abstraction. I could be wrong though. 
IT WORKS!! Declared the variables "T**heLongSide, ShortSide1, ShortSide2** " at the top of the code with a value and deleted "int" in the else/if statements. If the solution seemed really obvious it's cause I'm new to programming and I'm learning at home. Thanks for all of the replies. 
No shit, but my device still has to compile the JavaScript
&gt; compile &gt; Javascript 
So your argument is it's okay because JavaScript is 'interpretred'? 😂🤣 That's worse. And... Browsers compile it anyway!
If by that you mean being able to tell what the exact type is during *design* time, you can't. The best you can get from intellisense are abstractions that the type can be assigned to like interfaces and base classes. Most of the time, you are going to be exporting an interface that the type implements and that interface is how your main app interfaces with the actual class that had been exported.
What device are you using. I am using a Chrome browser on Windows 10. 38 requests 6.0 MB transferred Dom content loaded 3.36 seconds Load 4.06 seconds
All modern browsers JIT compile JavaScript... I fail to see how his statement is invalid.
General case. This is slower than it needs to be on every device.
&gt;ngrok thank u did the trick 
This is good for experimentation. It should never hit prime time. This is web forms in different clothing.
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopingLocallyWithASPNETCoreUnderHTTPSSSLAndSelfSignedCerts.aspx Not sure if you’re using .net core
Yes, it is an abstraction just like HTML is an abstraction. HTML is an abstraction of hypertext and markup. It is designed for linking pages across the Internet. And it is great when used for its intended purpose. https://csharpwebexpress.quora.com/Building-Websites-without-HTML In the demo, I am using CSharp classes to model an interactive user GUI. This has been the way that desktop systems have been built for a long time now. Apple's Objective-C/Swift, Java/JavaFx, MS CSharp/WPF/Winforms. HTML is not designed for this kind of GUI. That is why frameworks like AngularJS were created to extend the capabilities of HTML. CSharpWebExpress applies the desktop object-oriented programming model to building web applications. It is much, much easier that trying to do something similar in Angular, or React. As for debugging, the CSharp compiler does a pretty good job of catching obvious mistakes and there are built in debug facilities as well. You would never try to debug from the generated JavaScript code just like you would never try to debug a .Net from the generated ILASM. 
What language did you cut your teeth on, if you don’t mind the inquiry?
When you label/write it as “CSharp”, I don’t trust it. 
They look similar but they are based on different foundations. As I understand it, MS is trying to run Mono in the browser using WASM. But WebAssembly cannot directly access the browsers DOM - only JavaScript can do this at the present time. So, you have WebAssembly/JavaScript interop to allow the WebAssembly program to update the UI. The impressive demos that I have seen using WebAssembly use a &lt;canvas&gt; tag that is updated by the WASM program. So you have some very impressive graphics like tank battles and so on. For the normal type of website with text areas etc this won't work as well because of the interop overhead. CSharpWebExpress runs 100% in JavaScript and uses the amazing Qooxdoo framework. Qooxdoo has been around for more than ten years and has a really rich set of tested widgets like windows, buttons, pull-downs, trees, listboxes, etc. Just like desktop widgets in MS WinForms. If you are going to build a business-oriented website using CSharp, I don't think that you could do it today using WASM. Five years from now, you probably could because MS is heading in that direction. But today your choices are quite limited. -- ExtJS take a look at their licensing -- Angular 2.x or 3.x - it looks like a total mess -- React - I haven't tried it but I don't believe that it has widgets -- GWT - Google's GWT 3.x is for internal use only and 2.x has very limited widgets 
[removed]
Why?
WebForms is the definition of prime time. I have worked for large corporations and governments. Without exception, they all use Microsoft Office and use MS on their internal LAN's. There is a company that specializes in converting WinForms to Web using Qooxdoo the same way that I do. http://iceteagroup.com/winforms-modernization/ 
This problem is exponentially worse on internal tools' teams. A product at work takes over TEN seconds to load and I need to use it daily. It's a flash-based product with no caching. 
Pedantry
Not for doing the same job. General case: -- you want a rich GUI across all device forms -- JavaScript widgets run across all user devices -- the alternative is to code in Java/Android and Swift/iPhone -- browsers will still need to be done in JavaScript Humans can't detect GUI response differences of less than 400 milliseconds or so. So, yes you could make this run faster on mobile devices but not in browsers. And most users could not detect the difference. And you would now have three separate code bases to maintain. The demo that I put up is not for mobile devices - there is a separate library for that. 
Ok, I got it :)
So C, much pointer
I was trying something similar using Qooxdoo, Websockets and [Bridge.net](https://Bridge.net) [https://github.com/Terricide/ReVision/tree/rewrite\_bridge.net/src](https://github.com/Terricide/ReVision/tree/rewrite_bridge.net/src) However I ended up giving up on the project and going with WiseJ which did what I wanted.
I thought it was precompiled into web assembly? I agree the performance on initial load may suffer but I don’t think the browser is getting anything that isn’t precompiled and ready to run.
Since you're learning an OOP language, I would recommend creating a triangle class and a side class. 
You can still code native mobile apps in JavaScript with a shared React codebase. Or writing a JAM stack page will also hugely cut your size by generating static pages. Users may not notice but larger data packets significantly affect delivery over cellular data as well as battery life.
Try commercial solutions without investing too much time. If solution-specific "learning curve" is steep then just try the simplest one first. In my opinion SumoLogic is a good solution for logs. App can write to the regular file which is scanned by SumoLogic agent. Log data is then transferred to their servers. The good thing is that you do not need to worry about storage and scaling and logs from all your hosts can be searched as one big data set. It is easy to search and it is very efficient since you can just jump into search without finding and transferring multiple files . It is important to log good unique Ids in case you want to search for transactions and associate different services working on the same request. I would think that couple debugging iterations would give you a pretty good idea what to log and what IDs to use. Also log in JSON format as it makes search even better. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It's an interesting idea, I'll definitely give you that. Whether or not this will catch on... well, that part I'm not too sure about. Really cool idea though
Yes, WiseJ is a good product. 
Yes, I agree for mobile deployments.
I would recommend you look into SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). I think you will find that SSIS is incredibly powerful in its ability to aggregate data from any number of sources (DBs, applications, flat files, etc.), manipulate and transform data, and its ability to integrate with SSRS to produce detailed on the fly reports based on the template you've provided. 
I think you misinterpreted what /u/Blecki meant. For something simple as the startpage of the demo, it shouldn't take 4 seconds to load (i mean a 320 row javascript file which takes above 1sec to load isn't very optimized, maybe cache the compiled javascript on the server before building it again?). &gt; Humans can't detect GUI response differences of less than 400 milliseconds or so. Where did you get this from? Doherty Threshold? If that is the case, you've misunderstood what it's actually about.
It may catch on initially for very specific niche applications such as database access. An alternative would be ExtJS which has high licensing cost and a long learning curve. I programmed ExtJS on projects for about 5 years.
Unity 2D I reckon.
This was already possible with the hidden "__makeref" keyword. The "System.TypedReference.Value" field can't be accessed normally, but with unsafe indirection you can totally get it and abuse it.
I second this. Unity 2D uses C#.
Web developers are the fucking scum of the earth, man Only a web developer could be such shit that he manages to take functionality that worked well on a computer 20 years ago, and rewrite it so that new code does the same shit and runs just as slowly on a computer with 4,000x the RAM and processor speed
Show the complete code, including the `check` method.
Yes, I am aware of the startup time. The demo has not been optimized at all and it is loading several JavaScript *meta files to help in debugging. I could remove the debugging and run it through through some optimization tools to significantly reduce the startup time. The purpose of the demo was to demonstrate some of the viability of the approach. When I am talking about the GUI response, I am referring to responsiveness of the loaded application. The 400 ms threshold is a rule-of-thumb that I have used for several years in acceptance testing. Some applications are not very sensitive to start-up time. For example, a project manager may spend several hours in a scheduling application. The startup time of the application is secondary. What is important are the capabilities that the application provides. 
You have not provided enough information for anyone to provide a good recommendation. It depends so much on the specifics of your game, and your background/experience/preferences. Monogame *is* XNA, effectively. It is the modern descendant of it. Monogame or Unity are probably going to be the two top choices. Which one will be better for you depends a lot on the aforementioned things. With monogame you don't have to pay anyone royalities, you don't have to use a huge editor, but you also don't get as much of an asset pipeline system, asset store tools/plugins, no UI system built in, etc etc. That stuff might matter a lot or not at all. 
With Identity, I mostly just use entity framework to change rows in the underlying database. If you look in the database, I'm sure you'll find some tables that store the roles, claims, e.t.c. I'm not sure what tables exactly, as I haven't used [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core 2.2 yet, but with full framework on Web API 2 you will have the AspNetUsers, AspNetRoles and AspNetUserRoles tables. **This is how you do it with the old Identity, but maybe it will still help you**. I'm aware that Identity has changed a lot since, but maybe the underlying tables are similar. AspNetRoles has Id and Name columns. First thing to do is insert a row into AspNetRoles, with the role name you want, e.g. "Admin". You'll then have a row with values (0, 'Admin'). AspNetUserRoles has UserId and RoleId columns. Now insert a row into AspNetUserRoles, entering the UserId of the relevant user from the AspNetUsers table, and the RoleId from the AspNetRoles table. Now you have assigned a role to a user. Unless you do this manually, users do not have roles.
you can install unity its works with c#. You can develope 2D and 3D games 
Is the interop overhead really that much of a problem in practice? DOM manipulation in WASM shouldn't be far off anyway. I think Blazor will be a better alternative over all in about two years. 
&gt; less than 400 milliseconds or so If you have nothing but a spinner for 400 ms on every click or at least page/route change your users are not going to be happy. 
There is a misunderstanding here. There is no page/route change - there are no further pages being loaded from the server. This is a single-page-application (SPA). There would be a time penalty for loading new records from the database or for doing something computationally intensive. The server loads the initial page. After that it only handles: -- database requests -- authorization -- messaging -- misc resource requests such as images 
Even with DOM manipulation in WASM (which I agree still might be only about two years from now) there is still the issue of GUI widgets in the browser. If MS bought Sencha things would be different. Anyway, two years is a long time on the Internet. 
If you need to run a given chunk of code several times from within one function, and that chunk of code is useless outside of the function, then I think it could make sense. Then again, I've never done it, nor can I think of a realistic example of when it would be the best choice.
ill give that a try thanks. So if i change the button/textbox method to public, will i be able to access textbox/buttons from another class?
They're perfect for methods containing the `yield` keyword. Without local functions I **have to** make two methods: One that performs the pre-condition checks, and one that yields. I can limit the visibility of the second method to `private`, but even then... This method is **only ever** called from the first method.
Why bother compiling to Javescript with WASM exists almost universally now?
Oh, it should be fully possible, but right now I haven't added a way for Bassoon to read in a file from a stream. Take a look at the [Sinewave example](https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/Bassoon/blob/develop/src/Bassoon/Sinewave/Program.cs). It uses only the PortAudio bindings to play back a, well, a Sinewave from memory. If you have questions or need any help, fell free to reach out.
Surely the argument here is "use the right tools for the job"? If you need performant applications on the client side machine then go with c#, if not go with javascript?
I'll just add Godot in here, I think their vision of game dev is very nice !
SFML or SDL - Low level libraries which you build on top of. Best if you want to do everything yourself and learn a lot. MonoGame/XNA - Intermediate level libraries with asset workflow. Unity 2D - Lots of assets from the shop and lots of different option. If you plan to write games for a living, this is a good place to start.
WASM isn't a replacement for JavaScript in its current form. 1) it can't access the browsers DOM so its can't display anything without JavaScript interop 2) it doesn't handle garbage collection It just isn't a drop-in replacement for JavaScript in its current form. 
I'll look into it, thanks!
Webasm/Blazor isn't a viable solution for production right now, so no, C# really isn't an option. 
How do you sort out browser specific bugs? Abstractions are only as good as the skills used to write the abstraction. Developer use high level languages like C#, because there are (hopefully) highly skilled engineers at work that write low level abstractions. I'm coming from the Java world, and there are lots of abstractions like this available. Some of the most complete are Vaadin, Wicket and Primefaces, with different usage scenarios. [https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues) You can search here for browser specific isssues. They have full teams sitting on this. Also, nobody writes simple forms anymore. Most projects require responsible, quick designs, integrated in bigger portals, have numerous social media, tracker and other databinds. You always end up, in my experience in large projects, with some Javascript/HTML specialists to care of those issues. Angular didn't get big because people like to blow up their little projects, it became big because the requirements *out there* became unmanageable madness. In the Java space, the Wicket Framework comes close what you want to achieve. [https://wicket.apache.org](https://wicket.apache.org/) They spend lots of time to make "Normal" Java devs can write pages without knowing HTML or Javascript. This works to the extend, that they assume somehow that you have at least one guy there that writes Javascript/CSS, so you can fix browser specific quirks.
As a hiring manager I’ve never really put a lot of weight on certifications. I’ve seen too many devs with certs that couldn’t program their way out of a paper sack, and many with only a High School education that are rockstars. I mainly look for a rich work history with lots of experience in the areas I’m looking for. 
Thanks for that. It’s a real difficult one I think when applying. So many I’m applying for ask primarily for c# then go off into all sorts of other languages like node. I have a vast experience in a lot of languages and I’ve been an integral part of architecting solutions which would blow your mind but trying to get all that into 2 sheets of paper I’m finding difficult. I’m gravitating towards having to re-write my CV for each job to highlight the areas I’ve worked in previously which satisfy the requirements. I’ve no issue in doing that but never something I accounted for. I find a lot of jobs only list what they want out of someone without really going into what their goals are. I feel a lot of companies are just tech whores without really knowing their objectives. I solve problems with solutions and the tech chosen depends on the solution, it shouldn’t be a requirement. 
Don’t be afraid to go more than two pages. It will turn off some people, but I’ll read six pages of resume if it’s written with a reasonable level of detail. 
&gt; WebForms is the definition of prime time. That's not a good thing. &gt; I have worked for large corporations and governments. Same. However, that's not a good enough reason to double down on bad habits which is what this feels like. Tools like the one you linked is a good transition step, but it should not be the end goal.
I appreciate the comments, thanks for your input I guess I need to work on my CV some more 
Another option here is to prove the work you do, have a section in your cv that points to a github repository. Add a few bullets about the project description to the CV and then in the readme.md a more detailed explanation for the project. This way you keep the cv small but provide proof of ability if they need more detail. 
What alternative do you suggest for Web applications? If you want to replace "bad habits" with "good habits" then what are they? I mean something that works today and runs in currently deployed browsers. 
I'm trying to tell if this is a genuine question. Ten years ago I'd totally get where you're coming from but now? Hm. Bad habits include coding the UI in "code behinds" or anything that functionally acts like one. Anything that looks like DataTable.Columns.AddColumn simply should not exist anymore. They create barriers to change and increase the cost/risk when change does come. Learn a solid UI framework and go from there even if that's just MVC/Razor if you want to avoid Angular and the like.
Yes but it doesn't fix the object, so using it is basically suicide if a GC collection happens and your object is moved
One thing I’d like to ask: I have a section on my CV which goes into a business I run. I state the business as it’s one of the most complex projects I’ve ever worked on. It’s a mix of all .net technologies and is a high transaction and stable solution which is quite incredible. Would you be put off as a hiring manager that I actively run another business outside my day to day? I can see pros and cons. It shows I have passion which is outside of work but the con being that they feel I wouldn’t devote my full time to work. The truth is that the business runs itself and after our initial development only really consumes a few hours of work a month out of me. Would you see it as a negative?
This is really difficult for me. All clients I have ever worked with have been under NDA for the most parts and stuff I am actively working on now is trademarked and can’t be open. How do you tackle situations like this? I used to hate it when potential employees could not demonstrate work and here I am not being able to demonstrate what I’m capable of. 
That’s a hard one. I personally don’t mind my folks moonlighting a little bit as long as they’re getting their work done during the day. But it can be a huge turnoff for many employers. I might discuss it as a previous product/job that I’m proud of. Don’t lie, but don’t indicate that it’s still something you work on either. 
It's a tool like anything else - if it makes things clearer or safer, then use it. otherwise, don't. That said, I don't find myself using them very much. I think the use cases over a private method probably depend on how many arguments they'd need to take (local functions automatically get access to the whole local scope), and how easy to misunderstand they are (a local function may be called getThing, while the private method version might have to be called GetThingFromThisContextGivenTheseArguments to make it's usage similarly clear)
That’s great, thanks again for your input. I asked my business partner if it should be in there and he was unsure so it’s good to get a fresh perspective. 
Where did you get the 400ms from? You're just saying it's a rule of thumb that you've used, but that's not an answer to the question. It's at most an anecdote. So where's the data that backs that up? Human eyes can easily detect the difference in game running at 30fps and a game running at 60fps, only a 16.7ms difference. We may not be able to tell you exactly how long a single frame is on the screen, but we easily notice a difference exists.
On another note, you have a little bug: public static void GetOrders(FnVoidA fn) { Send("orers", (global::CSharpWebExpress.qx.constants.FnVoidA)fn); }
Get someone with some experience to review your configuration before you go live in production with this. 
I would never use any of that in production. But I dig the experiments.

Hello, if you want my biased opinion, I +1 unity. Awesome experience both 3d and 2d development. Unity keeps updating the 2d features as well.
Can you substantiate why you think it isn’t viable?
Lack of browser support (although, it is coming), lack of tooling, the already abundant tooling built around JavaScript, etc. Sure, it can be viable once browser support comes and tooling catches up, but that's going to be a long time from now.
Unity's API is super friendly for beginners and can easily scale with skill level. Honestly, unity is an amazing engine that you should get into for c# game development.
The developer tooling is certainly worse for now, but I don’t see what you mean with lack of browser support. It works out of the box with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (including on iPhone).
When you can't understand both lol
Ha
If you want to learn game development and improve your programming knowledge, I would recommend [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net). It is low-level enough that you will have to do the architecture yourself, but it also saves you from the tedious work of writing a rendering engine (although that is also an interesting challenge). Monogame is extremely similar to XNA, so you can use the resources and tutorials for XNA. I personally recommend you [Riemer’s XNA Tutorial](http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/series2d.php), but there are also some other great ones. So don’t use XNA, it is old and unsupported, use Monogame instead. [SFML.NET](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net) is also nice and has a very simple and understandable API. On the other hand, it teaches some bad practices by its design and, depending on the game you make, you are more likely to run into performance issues (with a naive approach). There‘s also [Ultraviolet](http://www.ultraviolet.tl). A great framework, very powerful, but absolutely unsuited for beginners. But it is something you can try when you want a bit more than Monogame offers. There are also some full blown game engines around, namely: Unity- I don’t have personal experience with it, but it is probably the most used game engine in the world. Also a big plus: the asset store. [Godot](https://godotengine.org)- the exciting open source game engine. Comes with a great editor and decent tutorials, also fast, lightweight and easy to use. On the other hand, the C# integration is somewhat new. Usable, but it could be better. Likely to improve in the next time though. Also has an asset store. [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality) - an interesting, 2D-only engine. The editor only runs on windows afaik, but the games are portable (I think). Nice to use, but lacks documentation and tutorials. I would not recommend it for a beginner. TL;DR: if you want to learn game programming, use Monogame. If you want to make a game quickly, use Godot or Unity. 
I suppose lack of browser support is a bad way of putting it. What I meant was the lack of a variety of runtimes as well as robust official specifications. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) submitted drafts back in early 2018, but I'm not entirely sure if they have officially released specs yet.
Its bad practice to compre strings with == Use string. Equals instead. Plus u can use ignorecasing
Stacktrace says “MoveNext”. You probably try to iterate a IEnumerable which is null. Basically: foreach (var item in null) Set some breakpoints and check your code.
Dont worry nobody goes into technologies like OP is posting thankfully. And 14mb is generous, its way more for even entire net runtime which you have to include to even run that compiled c#. Webassembly was never intended to code websites with, yet people try to do abominations.
I am a bit confused as to why. Let's say that we have a complex web application to develop. And we do it the "normal" way say with Bootstrap css, AngularJS, JetBrains WebStorm, Laravel PHP server, etc Six months into the project there are 20,000 lines of HTML, 30,000 lines of CSS, 25,000 lines of JavaScript and nothing is working. I have been on projects like that and once you get to the point of no return things go from bad to worse regardless of how much money gets thrown at the problem. Ok, let's compare that to what I am proposing. Everything is in MS Visual Studio Enterprise which automatically shows you the reference count for every function, when it was last updated and by whom. Plus, there are built-in tools for team support. If there is a problem with something not working we do code refactoring until everything is good again. In this case we are only refactoring a single language, CSharp, instead of an unholy mess of multiple languages all mashed together - PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSharp compiler will flag even the smallest inconsistencies and even suggest a fix. Once, the CSharp code is good to go you do a "Rebuild All" at the solution level and everything gets automatically rebuilt 100% from scratch. The JS will match the CSharp code because it is machine generated. The entire rebuild takes about 30 seconds. So, scenario one you are trusting humans to get it right and in scenario two you are trusting a compiler. You will never be able to rebuild the entire code base in scenario one - in scenario two it is no problem at all. 
You seem to be solely focusing on the Unity community.
Yeah, is there a subreddit for that?
I was just using that as an example due to Unity being the engine I use
I think the community is slowly becoming more and more toxic. We should be mature and help each other out but all I see more of is people slagging off other people’s code without giving any help or tips on how to improve.
It's *slightly* less verbose than an explicit Func or Action variable. It *may* be slightly more readable (by being closer to a garden-variety function declaration). It can bundle up yield behavior while still allowing the rest of the containing method to be evaluated immediately when called. I like them for dealing with helper methods that would either be obnoxiously long statement lambdas or explicit Funcs in the outer method's scope, for tidying up methods built around yield, and for bundling up repeated behavior inside the method that isn't general enough to be a good candidate for a separate method. As an example of the last one, I've used local methods for building TestCaseData objects for parameterized NUnit tests: // obviously, this is a trivial and contrived example public static ITestCaseData[] IsNull() { ITestCaseData Aux( string name, object x, bool expected ) =&gt; new TestCaseData(x) .Returns(expected) .SetName(name); return new [] { Aux("null -&gt; true", null, true), Aux("non-null -&gt; false", new object(), false), }; }
I agree. I wish we could help more I started posting my code to get help, on stuff. I wish we didn’t have to ask, because even when we ask they don’t help
This is cool and all but I feel like its a solution looking for a problem that doesn't exist. 
It never can be clients code. Start your own projects but use the LEARNING from the code you write at work. This will show a clean code base of what you do without risking the nda agreement. 
&gt; And we do it the "normal" way say with Bootstrap css, AngularJS, JetBrains WebStorm, Laravel PHP server, etc &gt; &gt; Six months into the project there are 20,000 lines of HTML, 30,000 lines of CSS, 25,000 lines of JavaScript and nothing is working. If you built out that much code and nothing is working, it is not the IDE, or the choice of tooling or languages that is the problem.
Ok, you're looking for help, or a review? Let's just get the obvious out of the way - no class name. Second you don't check if the character is grounded making it able to jump infinitely in the air. Depending on the type of the game you're making using Vector3.forward etc. may not be the best choice since it is in global coordinates. If you want to use it in a shooter for example I think that there is a transform.forward etc. which are based around transformation. Not sure though since I'm on mobile and would need to check the documentation.
r/unity3d
Thanks for the feedback! I wasn’t using this for a game more to see if someone could simplify the main part of the code (which is why there is no class name) but I will try using the transform.forward! Thanks!
Thanks!
You can look into Input.GetAxis and GetAxisRaw to simplify the W/S and A/D part.
That would be great! Thanks
It’s not limited to C#, game development in general is different from other software development. 
You have a point. It is in all types of programming, but C# is supposed to be simple, so I thought it was worth pointing it out!
Read Code Complete by Steve McConnell
IIRC some of the early C# Unity examples did not use namespaces. If I had to guess, the devs who created those samples elected to strip out structure in favor of succinctness, even if it was only one less indentation. I dunno, that's the best I got. It's bad practice, imho. It's been a good long while, though, so maybe that has changed. If that was someone's first introduction to C# it stands to reason they'd inherit the practice.
Have you looked at OSSU's DIY Computer Science degree path on github? Google it and take a look. It progresses into deeper courses. Good luck and happy coding!
Clean Code Clean Architecture Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code Agile: Principles, Patterns, and practices in c# Design Patterns Working Effectively with Legacy Code The art of unit testing The devops handbook 
It was the developers who were the problem in this case. Everything needed to be refactored. My point is that with a mix of technologies that is not easy to do.
The problem of building JavaScript-rich web applications is a very real problem. Sencha, Vaadin and others have built businesses around their solutions. Mostly, IT shops try to keep away from doing complicated web applications. GWT and AngularJS are two of Google's attempts to solve the problem; Blazor/Razor is Microsoft's latest attempt.
Demo server is available on GitHub. https://github.com/pdfisk/csharp_web_express_demo_server Seems to work fine when I download it and run under Linux or MacOS. Windows 10 seems to have issues with the download.
I don't see how - I would assume since strings can already be made into spans and span has knowledge of the pointer location that the Span object I end up has the same knowledge as a ReadOnlySpan. If the GC does something wonky then Span will know about it. Any way to confirm that?
The problem comes with changing interned strings. They’re stored in a hashtable in the runtime. If anything tries to lookup a changed interned string in the hashtable (such as when unloading an assembly) the hash likely would have changed, the string won’t be found, and the runtime will crash. Source: I work on one of the .NET teams at Microsoft and this has been a recent conversation topic in the office.
&gt; design patterns *Design Patterns* by the Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides. Alternately, *Head First Design Patterns* by Bates, Sierra, Freeman, and Robson. (I'd recommend the latter, actually. Both use Java for their examples, but the former is *very* dry.) &gt; software engineering Big topic. Maybe the most recent version of *Software Engineering*, by Somerville, but I only recommend it as it was the text we used in college, mumbledy years ago. (I think my copy's 5th edition, or something.) *However*: the topics you mentioned are programming topics, rather than *software engineering* topics. *Code Complete* by McConnell may be more directly applicable. Likewise *The Pragmatic Programmer* by Hunt and Thomas. To a much lesser degree, you may find value in *Writing Solid Code* by Steve Maguire, but it's closer to the sort of thing you're asking for. For 'best practices' in C#, I would really recommend you either ask for information about specific topics (i. e. async, or MVC or whatever) and give MSDN and Google a whirl. Stack Overflow may seem pretty hostile, but it's a valuable repository of information, once you understand how to ask Google to find the answer, there. There's often no need, now, to ask the question, yourself. For more detail on C#, check the stuff in the sidebar. You may also find *CLR via C#* of interest. Also, take a look at r/learnprogramming and r/learncsharp.
You people really hate JS, huh 
I didn't know about that, and after playing around with it, it works perfectly for what I want. Thank you!
You might want to consider hiring somebody to actually write one for you. There are professionals that are used to a lot of these sorts of questions than anyone here.
CSS, and HTML are tried, true and battle tested. They have solid specs and years of maturity. Knowing how to lean into them and use them efficiently has immense value. Same with JS. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue are designed for test-ability and to be easily debugged. And if you want to use a Transpiler, you cannot beat Typescript. Which is also in its own current era of maturity. I understand you want to only worry about writing C#, and to not have to leave the comfort zone of your IDE. Even if you don't the whole team can still use the same tooling and IDEs for developing. We are getting there with Blazor but there is still a very long way to go. Also, there is some beauty in having any back-end and having a regular HTML, JS and CSS app interact with it easily. All the technologies you listed do not have large user-bases, are still pretty young technologies, do not have a big variety of large enterprise grade set of samples. bridge.js, CSharpWebApp.js and qxlib.js are a nightmare to debug. I can debug JS quite easily in the Chrome, FF and Edge development tools because they are already designed to debug basic web apps. Also, there are broswer extensions for that sort of thing too. So, I stand by my orig comment saying I would never use Bridge in an enterprise app in a production environment.
&gt; been a recent conversation topic in the office. Because of this or were you aware of it already? I am quite aware that what I'm doing is a silly hack, I just found it funny. I was impressed by the Span of structs into Span of bytes using MemoryMarshal and looked for other neat stuff. GetReference(ReadOnlySpan) was kinda screaming at me like "YO I EXIST USE ME LOL"
We’ve been talking about it in relation to some stuff in the interop area with respect to unloadability.
I would not look at certs or degrees except for an entry-level position. These are honestly meaningless. What languages do you know? What technologies have you worked with? This is the first thing I look at in a resume. You should show a broad exposure. You should also show you've kept yourself up to date with some recent technologies. Second, what projects have you worked on? Personal projects are okay so long as they are not trivial ones. What was your contribution, and what challenges did you face? What skills did you use for each of them? A senior/lead dev should be one I can give just about any problem and they will be able to solve it -- your resume should support this with complex tasks and interesting problems that I'd get curious about and ask you more on in an interview. Keep in mind a lead position means more than being an expert in coding. Think of what this position means to you -- should you be targeting it?
How is it different from naudio or cscore?
Without using the `unsafe` keyword and compiler switch, yes. Of course that doesn't mean the other ways are "safe", but neither is `MemoryMarshal`.
Those are kinda smart a** answers. Technically correct perhaps but not real helpful. I just used jagged arrays a while back. I had an X, Y, Z point cloud with millions of points and needed to slice the point cloud up somehow. What I did is took the enclosing rectangle and sliced it up into cubes. Each cube was addressable using an index (cube[2][45][9] for instance. I then took each point and placed them in a list at that location in the array. Jagged arrays can be very useful but hard to initialize and work with. A big downside is you have to know how many elements you need before you initialize them. Most people will point you toward List&lt;T&gt; as those are really arrays underneath and are much, much easier to use in most cases. In my case I thought that using stacked Lists like that was clumsy.

&gt; Angular 2.x or 3.x - it looks like a total mess Not once you learn how it works. Web components rendering equally to web, ios, android, with hot reloading is nothing to ignore.
You can't be serious. 
I think many of the "frontend for dummies" abstractions are great for LOB software, where you don't see all of the unmanageable madness. If you are making a cloud-first public website, avoid at all costs and go Angular or other.

Been programming c# a long time, have no idea what you are talking about.
don't forget a point class. Then to navigate the data of a single triangle you can pointer hop a thousand times and completely flood the l1 cache. 
Unity is pretty good. The docs are quite fleshed out. I found it to be better documented than Unreal, and especially CryEngine, where the docs are practically non-existent.
If you want to move from junior to senior programmer mindset, read the following: https://www.amazon.com/Dependency-Injection-NET-Mark-Seemann/dp/1935182501 From the Amazon review: &gt; The Short Story: This is the best software development book I have ever read. By miles. Or, in deference to Mr. Seeman, in kilometers. Stop. Buy this book. It will change how you think, how you reason, how you sleep at night. See you in a year, we will both be smarter. &gt; The Long Story: I bought this book last year. I can't remember exactly why I bought it, but I suspect that it had something to do with intellectual intimidation and the frightening title. I come from a non-OO background, but I am too young to get through the next 20 years without dealing with the reality of OO prevalence in small (i.e. numerous) projects. I had 2 choices ... start at the bottom or start at the top. Believe me, I chose the latter with this book. &gt; I'm not going to explain the content in every chapter, simply because other reviewers have already done the job as I would have. Read Mr. T. Anderson's fine review if you need that kind of detail. Instead, I will talk about the effect that this book had had on how I think.

How do you run this? https://github.com/globant-sunil/EdgenuityATS Dont know how running a code works and such. Does this work? Thanks!
You can factor out the transform.position += and the DeltaTime by having a Vector3 NetVelocity that you construct from the input. Also, the way you have jump implemented doesn't really work like a jump. Right now it just moves you at a constant speed upwards.
I don't see that as being two separate versions of C#, I see it as people who use C# for Unity but don't actually know C# as a whole, and those who learn C# not from Unity but are just beginning, versus people who fully understand C# and know that there isn't really a difference.
I've had a copy laying around for a while, thank you for reminding me
With a private method, you may need to pass several variables by reference. So a local function is better in those situations. 
I do have a spare question or two for you. I wonder if it is possible to Console.Clear(); only a part of the console? I mean for example if I wanted to write a title with colors and stuff, it would always be visible no matter what happens in the program. For now, the solution I have is I wrote a method and as I clear console, I call my method so it looks like it didn't got cleared but it would spam my program imo. What would you do? Should I just forget it and move on since it's going to be useless anyways concidering I probably won't make anything out of the console in the future xD
&gt; It's slightly less verbose than an explicit Func or Action variable. It's also faster if you can avoid creating a delegate (e.g. passing it to a LINQ query). Though not normally an issue, the can be a real performance boost under specific conditions. 
A few people have mentioned MonoGame, if that seems interesting to you then you might want to look into [Nez](https://github.com/prime31/Nez): it's a 2D framework that's built on Monogame and it offers some nice features out of the box like a Scene/Entity/Component system, an extended pipeline including support for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps, a debug console, easier sprites and animation, pathfinding, etc. The creator is active on Reddit and you can read more about Nez/MonoGame in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/monogame/comments/5617d2/transitioning_from_unity_to_nez_as_a_monogame_noob/) old thread. 
Yes. This goes over how to be a good engineer at an Enterprise level 
If you still need to interface with Excel directly, then you will have to go with .NET framework (if you want to directly use Excel interop libraries in your code). For the authentication component: I'm not sure what you're looking to use, but if you're following this guide: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.2&amp;tabs=visual-studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.2&amp;tabs=visual-studio) then you can use that library in .NET framework 4.6.1 or greater. This is because that identity library is built to .NET Standard which is designed to provide APIs for all languages in the .NET family. See [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) Having said that, if you're going with .NET framework, I would think its easier to stick to [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC 5: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) which has its own ways of security: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/security/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/security/) &amp;#x200B; IMHO Based on the things that I've read from microsoft (their documentation, [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core/), other websites, etc), I believe .net core (and .net standard) will eventually become microsoft's most encouraged toolset for building new applications. Again, \*IMHO\* following this direction will make my applications the most future proof when developing with this toolset. &amp;#x200B; To directly answer your questions: 1) The provided templates in the dotnet cli are all for .net core. If you go with .net framework, you won't be able to use any of them. It would probably be easiest to stick to whatever template visual studio provides for mvc apps. 2) I think its reasonable to start with the provided template and move your code around as you learn and grow. 3) See link above on [asp.net](https://asp.net) mvc security. Again, if you find other libraries to be more helpful and they target .net standard, you are free to use those with .net framework given the version of framework you're using supports that version of .net standard. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps. Have fun!

Perfect, thank you
I appreciate taking the time to reply. My situation has always been a complex one as the teams I’ve managed have always been small in small but successful companies. To that end I’ve always worn many hats and I don’t always know a clear definition of what a “lead” dev really should be undertaking. My roles have stemmed from sysadmin up to architecture and planning. I’ve played big parts in planning complex systems but to the same end I’ve done the trivial parts of that implementation too so I never know which bits of that class as a hindrance on a CV. In larger companies all these are split out into specific groups. I don’t want to class myself as too broad like I don’t have expertise but at the same time I don’t want to take something away that the employee wants. For example: do I put on that I implemented the CI / CD systems for our company or would that normally be an undertaking of a different department? The main problem I have is that I used to write briefs for new devs and I know what we needed but sometimes conveying what we needed was difficult. I fear some job descriptions I’m reading are suffering the same fate and when they read the CV I’m putting in front of them it’s not ticking their boxes as ultimately they don’t fully know what they need.
You need to have visual studio installed, or too much c# knowledge to ask this question. &amp;#x200B; Short answer : download visual studio 2017 community, download the github source files, use visual studio to open AutomationTestSystem.sln, press f5 to launch the program. &amp;#x200B; Long answer : learn c# :) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Słaby troll 2/10 :D.
ive tried that i found a way to do it anyway which is good
i was looking for a way to code in to my program to open it. i know how to set a default program. all other google searches of how to code when you open your program with a txt for example, never worked. but i've found a way to to do it :)
Other then running it in separate process and terminate process there is no reliable way. Try to find better library.
&gt; Is there any way I can murder this thread(safely) and free up its memory(safely)? Tasks do not necessarily have to run on a separate thread. Tasks represent an asynchronous operation, not a parallel operation.
You would need to install a German language pack to get Argentinien. Something like this [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56117](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56117) There's probably something on Nuget that has this capability though. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; where someone can run a library in a long-running tasks in *background* How are you newing up these tasks? They are by default running "in the background," you wouldn't be creating some other kind of "background" object wrapping these tasks, would you?
Unity was spun off as open source a while back, as was Prism which is a higher-level framework that operates on top of MEF or Unity.
I believe newer versions of c# have default implementations on interfaces: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.infoq.com/articles/default-interface-methods-cs8](https://www.infoq.com/articles/default-interface-methods-cs8) &amp;#x200B; im not sure if they are out in the wild yet. &amp;#x200B; I usually either have an abstract FooBase, or use extension methods on IFoo &amp;#x200B;
Not out of the box, either use [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) or [this country list](https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list). CLDR has API packages available on nuget.
Ok, doesn't seem like the best approach since I want to use it for UI translations and German is just one of the supported languages. To do it myself it seems best to create my own translations and resolve via the (English) DisplayName
It looks a little bit like a resume to me 
True that.
You don't need the interface, just inject the Foo. If you want to mock the members, just make them virtual (but you shouldn't need to if you are [properly testing your system against it's public interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM)).
Is this what you're looking for? var supportedCultures = new[] { "en-US", "es-AR", "nl-BE", "de-DE" }; foreach (var cultureName in supportedCultures) { var region = new RegionInfo(cultureName); Console.WriteLine(region.NativeName); } // OUTPUT: // United States // Argentina // België // Deutschland
I guess I’m not talking about the technical stuff, but the Im talking about the community more.
Thanks, I’ll take this into consideration!
The point of having an interface with dependency injection is that you can use different services in different environments. You may for example have a different DB and session management in your development environment. Your unit tests will also use fake services. Additionally, interface implementation isn't inheritance. Also don't use default implementations on your service interfaces please. 
Well with this we can still make 2 groups, and the normal C# looks much harder so they could get discouraged looking at that if they use Unity, or Unreal, and other engines with C#
One of the best resources I've found is Bob Martin's clean coders video series (cleancoders.com) They are pricey, but safaribooksonline.com has most of them for free with a subscription. They also offer a free trial.
I would add in here dependency injection in .NET. That book definitely elevated my own personal software engineering ability. 
Well, first of all your Class/Interface wouldn't compile because it contains the same member name twice "Val1". Besides that, yes... consider this: In a number of realizations of IFoo the Func(); method has the same content: Your idea to turn this into FooBase is correct. You name the class XYZBase or AbstractXYZ (wherein XYZ roughly describes the kind of abstraction you are doing; let's say its base person class with method .Move() where all inheriting classes "walk" a certain way: Moon Walking - thus the abstraction is: AbstractMoonWalkingPerson or MoonWalkingPersonBase \[depends on whether or not you want your API consumer to be able instantiate the base class or not\]) Now you can implement the moon walking logic inside the base type. IFoo always requires us to expose some properties, but you don't want to implement them in the BaseClass because that sometimes doesn't fit the model you're trying to code. To be able to mark certain members required by interfaces as "Out of Scope" of your abstraction type you just mark the base class as abstract (meaning you can't directly instantiate it) and put the "Out of Scope" members in there as abstract members, forcing any deriving type to implement that member by themselves. Here the example: &amp;#x200B; `interface IPerson` `{` `void Move();` `bool HasNose { get; }` `bool HasFeet { get; }` `}` `public abstract class AbstractMoonWalkingPersons : IPerson` `{` `public abstract bool HasNose { get; }` `public abstract bool HasFeet { get; }` `public void Move()` `{` `Console.WriteLine("Do the moonwalk!");` `}` `}` `public class SomeRandoDancer : AbstractMoonWalkingPersons` `{` `public SomeRandoDancer(bool hasNose, bool hasFeet)` `{` `HasNose = hasNose;` `HasFeet = hasFeet;` `}` `public override bool HasNose { get; }` `public override bool HasFeet { get; }` `}` `public class MichaelJackson : AbstractMoonWalkingPersons` `{` `public override bool HasNose =&gt; false;` `public override bool HasFeet =&gt; true;` `}`
Removed: Rule 4.
Great list, I would add implementing domain driven design
Why do you have duplicate code? Is it for mocking? Then good. Are you creating many different concrete implementation right away as part of the functionality? If so, why are they doing the same thing? Right now you're trying to make the classes conform to your interface, instead of making the interface conform to your logic. Does your logic use all the properties? Does it call all the functions?
Where's your sense of challenge. The challenge is in being able to do it - Not in making it an available product.
You mean Booch et al for the OO design and analysis?
Yes, the Booch.
```csharp public abstract class FooBase : IFoo { abstract int Val1 { get; } abstract int Val2 { get; } public int Func() { return Val1 + Val2; } } public class Foo : FooBase { override int Val1 =&gt; 1; override int Val2 =&gt; 2; } ```
Thanks :)
It is something like this: I have these "curves" that all implement `ICurve` and have a bunch of properties then calculator uses them like `Calculator(ICurve curve);` in its constructor and instantiates based on those variables. So far so good. Now the "curve" can have a `CheckValid()` function that checks to see if it is valid but the process is the same (it uses the property values to do some calculations and return bool) which is why I am trying to decide what is the best approach for implementing this without having to repeat myself each time I build a new class that is implementing `ICurve`. I am still new to c# and I have yet to learn a lot of concepts for "best approach".
&gt; do you really need IFoo? That is a good question that I was asking myself too. Initially I had `IFoo` and it didn't contain any functions so it made sense. Now I've just added that function so things got a big complicated. I guess one reason why I would still need `IFoo` interface is if I were implementing it differently like with `FooBase : IFoo` and `BarBase : IFoo` and still wanted to use `IFoo` in my functions accepting instances.
Thanks it was very helpful.

It looks more dated because the theming is probably not implemented at all. It uses the default drawing for controls anda ll.

The thing about those exams is some of the questions are a matter of finnesse and intricate knowledge of .net's fundamental workings. They're things you would know if you actually start studying .net for the sake of learning it, rather than coding in c#. Truth be told, some developers can go their whole carreer without encountering some of the things asked on those exams. You can find practice questions online for each particular exam. A quick search should reveal them, but just be warned, with one year of apprenticeship, it may be a bit soon to jump into this thing and some of the questions (and answers) could go over your head. Still, it's a perfect opportunity to learn!
&gt; What should I learn now? The intermediate and advanced stuff. Maybe learn another language or programming paradigm or two, to get some exposure to ideas that C# doesn't capture or really promote. Also, learn how to actually apply the things you know to solving problems, probably by actually applying the things you know to solving problems. There's not really a walkthrough for becoming an Expert Developer, in this or any other language. 
Meanwhile, in /r/cars *I've learned the basics, gearbox, right of way and other stuff like that. What should I learn now?*
In WPF they have base classes with implementations. The interfaces have little to do with it. Look around in System.Windows.Media namespace. A Geometry has a collection of Figures which each contain a collection of segments. They decided that everything is a PathFigure, but the segments vary, like arc, line and bezier. The Figure has a function that tells you if it has curves, based on logic where it checks its segments. The segments are derived from the abstract PathSegment which doesn't really provide any logic; it's just a common baseclass to allow any combination of segments in a Figure's segment collection. Which allows any combination of Figures in a Geometry. Interfaces are absent. Haven't looked if they did it differently in UWP. Interfaces should describe what an object *can do*, not what an object *is.* Where would they come into play here? Well, your ICurve example, in my opinion would only have a single function; HasCurves, returning a bool which the base Figure class implemetns. Then it's up to the Figure object to find out if that's the case based on its segments. &amp;#x200B; But we're past the topic of Dependency Injection now. This is more framework architecture and design and that's beyond me.
I think I’ll buy a copy. Amazon’s preview shows a photo the author has where a cheap hotel has wired the room’s hair dryer straight into the wall (to prevent theft, presumably). This is analogous to not being able to inject your own hair dryer into an interface and illustrates how a technical expert is needed to do it safely. 
Cool, I didn't know this, I have to check it out later. But I'm afraid in this case "curve" here doesn't exactly have much to do with geometry since it is Elliptic Curve used for cryptography so it is not for drawing, it is for calculation. Basically it is a way for me to inject "prime, order, generator point, a and b" into the calculator so that it can do things like multiplication modulo p. 
I don't know if it can be applied to your use case, but sometimes when I need to call some library that I don't control, I use the following pattern: ```csharp await Task.WhenAny( Task.Run(() =&gt; library.Method()), Task.Delay(timeout, cancellationToken) ); ``` That way, if the library method takes too long, I can still exit the surrounding task. And eventually, call some other method/capability on that library that can stop() more or less gracefully the other processing (maybe throwing some exception that I can catch and log).

Eh, if it's wrong I don't want to be right, I do the same thing I think it reads a lot better. I also do K&amp;R in Razor/ASPX, probably because it's standard for javascript.
Thanks.
I prefer K&amp;R braces, always, but as long as you're consistent, it really doesn't matter.
&gt; Tasks do not necessarily have to run on a separate thread. Tasks represent an asynchronous operation, not a parallel operation. But using Task.Run or similar always does.
Sure. That's why I said "not necessarily". And we don't know what that code is doing. :-)
I very strongly don't mind/care which of the two, or both, people use. I like the KR style as it saves vertical space which is something slightly useful. Ideally we would submit code in some neutral form and our editors would display it as each user prefers! 
I think it looks fine. The biggest problem is communicating with your team to get a consistent style. "Always Allman" or "always K&amp;R" is easier to explain and understand than "Allman, except expressions, which are K&amp;R".
My workplace uses PHP, and they've adopted "the" standard which mixes the two. Classes and functions/methods are Allman, but everything within them (including lambdas) is K&amp;R. Quite frankly it's a fucking mess. I personally (where I have control over what I write) use Allman for {} and K&amp;R for (), which helps to ensure very easy scope visibility. It can be long-winded however.
Michael Jackson.HasNose returns false 😂😂😂
[Task.Run](https://Task.Run) always runs on the thread pool, but I don't think there's any guarantee that it has to be a different thread from the one you scheduled it from.
You could give [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) a gander. I use this to ensure blocks of code execute in a specific amount of time or else I fail the process. This is to avoid things like hung connections. There's a Timeout Policy that might work for you. Here's an example: Policy policy = Policy.TimeoutAsync(120, (context, timespan, task) =&gt; throw new TimeoutException("Exec library could not initialize within timeout period.")); Then you execute your code later on: await policy.ExecuteAsync(async (ct) =&gt; { exec.Initialize(); }); You can even combine policies so you could use a timeout policy with a retry policy. Check it out, it's a great library and might be what you're looking for.
It's always about preference, but StyleCop recommends only one way for easy standards and because it makes it easier to add to an if block later particularly if you had something like if (condition) statement; But honestly it is all a matter of preference, and if you have a team getting the team to agree to the preference.
This is an ideal place for an abstract base class. It allows you to implement what you need from the interface whilst making the rest abstract and up to its children to implement. Or as you said create a normal base class and make any overridable members virtual.
Yes, it always does. Task.Run uses QueueTask on the default, thread pool task scheduler, and this in turn always uses ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueCustomWorkItem which never executes inline. Executing Task.Run code inline would definitely cause deadlocks in a lot of code out there. By the way, great that I’m downvoted for stating a fact, to elaborate on the already given answers. 
Be aware that `CultureInfo`/`RegionInfo` are system-dependent and might work differently based on what OS you're running them on. A basic example: Windows 7 has a smaller list of cultures than Windows 10.
Thanks cDaneish - for the resources and comments. My concern with ASP.NET MVC is that the Razor pages are Microsoft's (losing) attempt at coming up with a frontend framework, and that given React's demand, and versatility, it would be the better option from a developer's standpoint. Perhaps I'm misguided, however. As to your questions, my only comment relates to #1. I am able to create a React + .NET Framework WebApp in VS2017. This isn't the CLI, but it does work. See: https://imgur.com/gallery/VhguSSs. 
Why can't you just add React to a mvc site?
I am a developer myself. Also, I manager an IT department for several years. In the specific case that I am referring to, their was one particular developer who was in way over his head and the client didn't replace him until he had severely damaged the project. 
Unity has some bad practices like overriding the `==` operator for regular reference types. That's fairly weird in *normal* C# code. Unity is also **very** gaming oriented (obviously), which differs from your usual line-of-business and web-apps.
I am not saying that it cannot be made to work. Web component rendering across platforms is a property of HTML5 and not specific to Angular or any other framework.
&gt; I think the community is slowly becoming more and more toxic. In general "*the*" community is very welcome. But the larger a community becomes, the more troublesome people are attracted (like me). And these kind of people often stand out from the crowd and shine a bad light on the whole community. Personally I'm having a hard time dealing with people that obviously did not spend any thought or effort, then proceed (often several times) to ask very simple basic questions.
Let's agree to disagree then. I have been developing web applications since 1997 mostly for large corporate clients. Some of your concerns I do not understand. &lt;&lt;Also, there is some beauty in having any back-end and having a regular HTML, JS and CSS app interact with it easily.&gt;&gt; The demo that I showed can work with any backend - the CSharp compiler is used to build the JavaScript that runs in the browser - it has nothing at all to do with deployment. 
I don't hate JS at all. Since about 2005, most of the work that I have done involves JS.
Do an internship? 
Without posting a lot of details, I'll just demonstrate it how I've come to understand it. Most explanations of inheritance are without context - that is to say, it is hard to understand *what* inheritance is without understanding *why* you would use it. Here is one of many possible examples - we have code that wants to deal with some data we have stored somewhere. We have several places we might want to store the data - in a SQL database, in a Redis cache, and possibly in memory (like if we're doing testing, or if we just want to stand up some quick ad-hoc server.) So we can write all of our code that USES this storage, because at the end of the day, that code shouldn't care how the data is stored. And we write the code that deals with the storage of that data. Then, to make it possible to re-use the code, we build interfaces - or contracts. We say that, to access the data, we will always use these parameters. public class BusinessObject { private readonly IGetPerson getPerson; private readonly ISavePerson savePerson; // Dependency Injection! Worth a look if you're interested in why we do this public BusinessObject(IGetPerson getPerson, ISavePerson savePerson) { this.getPerson = getPerson; this.savePerson = savePerson; } void ChangePersonName(Guid personId, string newName) { // Code that shouldn't care what storage we're using var person = getPerson.GetPerson(personId); person.Name = newName; savePerson.SavePerson(person); } } public class Person { public Guid Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } public interface IGetPerson { Person GetPerson(Guid Id); } public interface ISavePerson { void SavePerson(Person person); } // Used to store using SQL database public class SqlPersonRepo : IGetPerson, ISavePerson { public Person GetPerson(Guid Id) { // query sql database for person } public void SavePerson(Person person) { // persist person to sql database } } // Used to store using Redis cache public class RedisPersonRepo : IGetPerson, ISavePerson { public Person GetPerson(Guid Id) { // query redis cache for person } public void SavePerson(Person person) { // persist person to redis cache } } // Used for testing code without relying on external connections public class InMemoryPersonRepo : IGetPerson, ISavePerson { public Person GetPerson(Guid Id) { // query memcache/dictionary/whatever for person } public Person SavePerson(Person person) { // persist person to memcache/dictionary/whatever } }
or just use Markdown triple Single-Quote brackets around the whole block. New-Reddit Editor does much better with this.
&gt; By the way, great that I’m downvoted for stating a fact Because you're you're conflating two different things and in so doing stating an incorrect "fact". &gt; Yes, it always does. No, it does not. &gt; Task.Run uses QueueTask on the default, thread pool task scheduler, and this in turn always uses ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueCustomWorkItem which never executes inline. While your description of the internals of Task.Run is correct, that does not mean that the the thread pool cannot end up using the same thread that initially called Task.Run to continue the task later. Also, unless that behavior is part of the public contract of Task.Run, it is foolish to rely on it. More foolish to tell others they can count on that behavior. 
thanks! Its just that when you run a program in visual studios on your computer, how can it affect the website that it is intended for? Like if you have a C# for a site and you download the source file and run it on your computer, how does it end up even knowing your on the site that you intend to use it? Thanks for the clear explanation, it's appreciated!
If your user is using Windows in German, he'll get it, I think.
As a former Java dev, who writes more C# now, I would say don't make things different as in the language standards. &amp;#x200B; First it was hard to switch the braces style, but to be honest, it simply don't matter as long as it is consistent.
Agreed, it's about the team... for my team, it needs to be automatable with with Code Analyzers
There is some key points you're missing. But first, tell me what exactly you want to do with this github repo
in .NET Allman braces are the standard really, so I would stick with that. but in the end its about readability and consistency (for sanity's sake). with modern screen sizes, large storage, and better compression, we don't really need to worry about wrapping and file sizes and such. readability is most important. 99% of the time the file is rarely opened, but when it does the readability and consistency is what counts, not number of lines or bothering to scroll a bit to see a parameter for a second.
I use Allman only with throwing exceptions: if (argument == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(argument));
You should queue this work since 30 sec chunks of CPU are pretty large. This would be trivially easy to bring down if you do the work in process. Setup a Windows Service or even a console app to be your number cruncher. Have your web app interact with this external component. If you want to get fancy, use Service Fabric to scale the work depending on how many requests you need to support concurrently.
Azure functions could be used in the same way I imagine? Instead of a Windows service? Then it can just be scaled as needed.
Learn F#
I just double checked the processing time limit. Azure Functions would work.
Sounds like you need an icurvevalidator to do your logic and inject that where required. 
From a client-side perspective, consider accepting the input with a HTTP 302 redirect to the URI for the eventual response. Use a HTTP 202 to indicate that processing is not complete. Keep retrying until it resolves to a 200, or 5xx (at that point you have your resource or it has failed. From a server side perspective, you don't want to tie up the HTTP pipeline, so create a stub record in the database (so you can know to send back the 202), then do your background processing asynchronously, finally update the entity with the result of processing and mark it as complete. When you get the next request, send back a 200 and you are good to go. 
We are invested in serilog and seq as we are 1. Cheap, and 2. Cloud adverse It works pretty well for us with dot net core. We inject the request properties into our message bus headers, push them onto the logging context so each service can pick up the original request information. Sure it might not be as easy as just referencing some nuget and have it work auto magically. And seq is only as useful as you configure it. But it has dashboards, you can configure signals and alerts. 
&gt;Edit: except if the current code is running on a threadpool thread, then it may queue it to that thread, I suppose. That's pretty much what I said, and is one of the scenarios encompassed by my point. &gt;It will eventually be stolen by another threadpool thread Not guaranteed at all, AFAIK.
This^ Make a new mvc/api solution for the backend bits. If you want to setup an external toolchain for the front end, you certainly can. I’ve done it with Vue/Angular, and it was pretty straightforward. 
Why are you taking the test? Studying for the test makes sense; you will learn a lot of material. But before you spend the money on the actual certification, know what your goals are. In my case, the only time my certifications mattered was when my company was a Microsoft Certified Partner. That status required that we maintain a certain number of certified developers/engineers. 
Good points but my job is actually paying for it and if I pass I get a raise. Is it a difficult test? Are there any study materials that you found particularly useful?
I used the MS Press books. I found them to be useful, but they didn't cover everything on the test. (Note that my test was several years ago; your test will be different even if it has the same number.) Here's an example test page. I'm seeing a lot more options than when I took the exam. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx
Not many people that I know usethe new reddit. And as I absolutely lpathe it, I would rather manually convert it to the old markdown.
I’m here to learn from the comments. Thanks! Hey what do you do @jennsterzen
To be clear, I'll be polling the GET URI periodically until the database entry says that it is complete? I don't know anything about IHostedService, but I will begin research on it soon. Thanks for the response and suggestions!
Just use TPL...
Thank you for the suggestion! I'll be looking into creating a Windows Service, and/or Service Fabric.
That's the simplest and most canonical (w/r HTTP REST conventions) way to implement the desired functionality. It's certainly not the only possible solution.
I always advise people to not use inheritance. Use composition instead. But i guess you just have to go through inheritance path to understand why.
I'm certainly open to exploring other options as well if you think they would be better.
I didn't take the c# but took the web development one and now working on mvc to get mcsa on the dev track. 1) understand the principal of the topic. Studying tests/questions is not the way to go. 2) they will try and confuse you with syntax and names. 3) there is how it's done and how Microsoft wants it done. Sometimes this overlaps but remember it's Microsoft giving the exam. This might be less so since it's C# but you get the idea 4) most exam refs are missing content and not indepth 5) might be worth dropping money on a udemy course or hitting up pluralsight 
I found that the "C# 7.0 in a Nutshell" book is great for explaining all the concepts. I recommend you read through the important sections of that book.
You can still exhaust the pool and lock up the process in a burst scenario.
So what do I get for paying github? I had to pay for a year not too long ago for these features. 
Probably CI. I was doing my private projects on GitLab just because it had private repos, but if you get free CI on GitHub that would be awesome.
oh, should have clarified, I want to translate it as part of a web application, so the server executes the `CultureInfo etc` But as it turns out the API doesn't support what I want anyway, so I'm going with a handcrafted `.resx` file
Dope
I think CI comes with Free as well.
The catch is on the private repos on Free plan: They can only have up to 3 collaborators. They can't have pages/wikis. No protected branches. They won't show Insights. All of these are more than fair, imo :) And I think the Enterprise plan has a whole range of other support.
Guess I'm moving off of Bitbucket! Sorry, Atlassian!
Yes, honestly I only use private repos to get version control on stuff that is not ready enough for the public eye. If you need more than 3 collaborators then you could always use another platform, or just pay for pro.
Seems like you would be better off with an XML document.
I have a JSON doc but the thing is that i need that data within the code because i can't use external files. So i need a way to essentially hardcode the json into a dictionary so i can add that to my configuration builder.
Wouldn't a second API be smoother? The function would be only the expensive processing. The main API will just wait with async/await untill it completes? It woudn't block the pipeline
I haven't worked with JSON as much as XML, but I'm pretty sure you can use the NewtonSoft library to deserialize into an object. I think in the latest .net version JSON serialization/deserialization is part of the .net framework.
i guess gitlab and bitbucket scared them enough after the initial Microsoft acquisition announcement. Smart move on github's part. 
Git in there! Nice!
This here is the correct answer, [u/Anon22a](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anon22a) &amp;#x200B; [https://scottlilly.com/c-design-patterns-composition-over-inheritance/](https://scottlilly.com/c-design-patterns-composition-over-inheritance/)
I kind of hoped this would happen when MS bought it. You get them on VisualStudio.com. I do like VS.Com, but it's feature heavy and it can be a bit baffling. Quite a bit of their documentation is very out of date. The other day I had to find the option to use the legacy UI just so I could follow the docs to do something. Github is just easier to blat stuff into.
You shouldn't implement your own logger and probably don't need to setup your own logging host. &amp;#x200B; You can use a service such as [logz.io](https://logz.io) as a start. Your logs will be accessible to you in no time. When the company grows you might want to think about storing your logs in some other way.
Exactly. I think VisualStudio.com is 10 users? but who cares, I just want somewhere I can hide my shame :) We already use inhouse github at work, it's a no brainer for me.
Exactly :)
It's 2019, no one is better off with an XML document.
I've been using Gitlab for 3 or 4 years now. Only switched from Github to Gitlab to hide my shameful projects from potential employers
/u/username is how you "tag" someone on reddit. for example /u/edubbs38 
Bloody Microsoft! Giving away free stuff to developers again. When will it end?
[dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com) documentation is great. 
I’m moving off visualstudioonline tonight! Thanks for the PSA!
I think there's a disconnect between the new branding and trying to google the answer to a problem. By google I mean search, and by search I mean both in their docs and through google :) MS do often do really good documentation though. 
Lol :) "And here's a solution I added which has 9 projects in, 3 have code, and two of those don't compile. I abandoned it after a year. So, job??"
&gt; That's pretty much what I said, and is one of the scenarios encompassed by my point. Right, but this is the only scenario where it can happen. Think of any others? &gt; Not guaranteed at all, AFAIK. It is, it’s a works stealing system. No work item is left on a local queue forever. The only exception to *that* might be to eternally starve the pool, but it would have to be with the current items, as otherwise the queued item would eventually make its way up. I think that’s very unrealistic. &gt; I don’t think that calling it “inline” is the correct term here, rather, you’re talking about executing it on the same thread that’s potentially waiting for the result. By inline I mean executing it right after some other work has finished. This is what happens with task continuations, if the proper conditions are met, but it never happens with work items on the thread pool. &gt; I think what you’re referring to are deadlocks that can be caused by not using ConfigureAwait(false) wherever possible. No, I am not taking about that. That’s a separate issue that is only relevant for task continuations including await, not work items in the pool.
Ugh, Is it really worth it? What’s the biggest difference? I haven’t had any issues with Bitbucket.
&gt; Because you're you're conflating two different things and in so doing stating an incorrect "fact". No, i dont believe I am. The central point is that when using Task.Run, your code will eventually execute even if you spin forever right after. &gt; While your description of the internals of Task.Run is correct, that does not mean that the the thread pool cannot end up using the same thread that initially called Task.Run to continue the task later. It can, but it’s never forced to do so, meaning it will always execute even if you don’t release the current thread. &gt; Also, unless that behavior is part of the public contract of Task.Run, it is foolish to rely on it. I’d say it is, as it states that it queues it on the thread pool which says &gt; Queues a method for execution. The method executes when a thread pool thread becomes available. And they will, unless you keep the maximum number of threads starved in their current state forever. This is completely unrealistic. &gt; More foolish to tell others they can count on that behavior. It’s a personal opinion, people tell others those all the time in this sub. OP’ll be fine.
A Task is meant to be an asynchronous operation that completes. It can be long-running, but it isn't intended to be infinite. The best mechanism it has for terminating itself is the cancellation mechanism. Threads were the same way. While there is an `Abort()` method that does what it says, you are strongly encouraged not to use it. The behavior is that it terminates the thread with a ThreadAbortedException, which is really likely to bypass cleanup tasks you had intended to run, which means you're going to leak resources or potentially leave things in an invalid state. So if you know you are going to have to end a thread asynchronously, it is a lot smarter to design it to be gracefully cancelled. The same goes for Tasks. They sort-of-kind-of represent threads, but the resources they used are shared by the whole scheduler and you can mess up a lot of things if you violate its expectations. Mainly: long-running tasks have to be configured a special way so it knows they'll be tied up, and you don't get to terminate tasks. If you want a task to terminate early, it should support cancellation. If the problem is that your tasks are waiting on things like `HttpClient` methods that don't support cancellation... tough cookies. MS didn't do the right thing, so now you're stuck having to work around them. Sometimes your best bet is to go find something else that does what you need and does support cancellation. Other times you just cheat and instead of awaiting the `HttpClient` task directly, you `Task.WaitAny()` the `HttpClient` and a task you can cancel. 
&gt; Right, but this is the only scenario where it can happen. Think of any others? No, it's the only one I can think of. When something is scheduled to the thread pool, it can be picked up by any thread pool thread. Depending on the size of the thread pool, and what the other threads are doing, it could be most suitable to keep the current line of processing on the same thread. I think the thread pool determines this as it sees fit.
GitHub pretty much just killed the only reason (I’m aware of) people were using bitbucket over github
So VS Online (Azure DevOps whatever) is still better because you can have 5 people on the project.
I think usually people usually just leave the title. I don't know of any way to selectively clear lines from the console. You can clear the whole thing and reprint the parts you care about, but I'm not sure it having a title is a problem that needs a solution in most cases.
GitHub is pretty much a community, and BitBucket is just a git host. If you have _any_ open source repos, then hosting them on GitHub makes them really discoverable, and you're able to interact with other repositories (fork, track issues, open PRs) with the same account. Most of the FOSS software you work with will be on GitHub so these benefits start to add up. 
Gotcha, I’d consider myself a learning, hobbyist programmer and my only 2 repos are work related. Not really a public repo in their current state. Working on open source repos is something I need to get into though. 
LINQ and database design principles.
More important than your style preference is having your team's tools handle it for you. 1: Pick and use a style specification, define your weird rules explicitly and commit this with your sourcecode. EditorConfig is what you should check out first for .NET. 2: Pick and recommend tooling that helps enforce or reveal the style. VS2017 has full support for EditorConfig, and ReSharper adds even more options, just as an example. Optionally enable automatic formatting on save. You or someone on your team should never have to think or worry about which style is correct, or cause more commits to 'fix' something that wasn't enforced. The toolchain should put their braces exactly where the style dictates. PS: K&amp;R all the way; vertical pixels are precious. It can make the difference between fitting a whole thought on the screen and having to scroll. class { method() { try { if () { } else { } else if () { } } catch () { } catch () { } finally { } } } PPS: Newline at end of every file.
That's what i thought, I can't find any solution for that and my teacher even redirected in Visual Studio to the Windows form application instead. I asked a collegue about it and he told me I could always program a code to clear a particular line in a library, which is way over my knowledge right now. But thanks for your answers.
Direct jira ticket and git integration means we'll be staying with bitbucket. We were paying more for private repos and couldn't manage source control against tickets using github, now we're paying for a service that's free elsewhere but we have a whole suite of atlassian integration. 
What's most important is that you do the same thing consistently every time. The goal is that everyone working on the code can write in such a way that you can't tell who wrote what code by style alone. I wouldn't mix styles, I think that confuses people more than seeing a style they don't like used consistently. I particularly don't like the practice of omitting brackets if the if statement "only has one line". It always turns out later you want to add another line, and it's a pain to add the brackets later. Or later, you might delete an extra line, and then you have to delete the brackets too, which is a pain. And if you aren't careful, you can accidentally set things up to flow in a way that isn't obvious. I've seen some code that says "OK what if I put the expressions on the same line?" like: if (somethingBad) throw new ArgumentException("..."); That tends to come from people who started in a language with cooler flow control statements like Python or Ruby. I don't want to get too deep in the argument but here's my personal feeling, followed by the deviation I make. You should make your code look like what Microsoft's looks like on MSDN. That's what most other public C# developers have done. That means whatever this style is called, you use it: if (someConditon) { EvenIfSingleLine(); } else { int whatever = 3; AndMultipleLines(whatever); } My team, for whatever reason, decided on the Java-style convention where the opening brace goes on the same line. I use that because I value being consistent with their style more than winning a holy war. But if I were setting the policy, I would use the MSDN standard. It's what most C# devs are used to seeing.
Oh cool, I get to save $7 a month! Honestly though, having private repos for work is such a huge convenience for me, I might just keep paying anyway. As much as people shit on Microsoft for Windows 10 and almost every other aspect of the company, their development stack and tools are pretty legit
Yet another good place to start is: [https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
&gt; No, it’s the only one I can think of. Yeah me too. The work stealing queue system is implemented for cache locality reasons, but it will never prevent other threadpool threads from eventually picking up work (when they run out of their own thread local queue).
I really hope they possibly increase the number on Github. Azure DevOps setup and interaction always feels like a mess to me.
Workflow and fork-syncing. My shop has everyone working on their own fork, using a modified git flow. Bitbucket has fork-syncing, which means you always have the latest upstream changes, as long as you've pulled recently. Nothing gets merged without a PR, which must be approved by at least three reviewers. Merging pull requests is a one-click operation in Bitbucket, whereas in Github it requires three. I've worked in a couple of shops that didn't use this workflow, and were either using regular git flow, or trunk-based dev. The lack of conflicts and clarity of state of the trunk branches is a *vast* improvement over anything else, and Bitbucket supports it *vastly* better than Github does. There are a few other advantages, but those are the big ones. We actually transitioned from Github *to* Bitbucket last year, and if I were setting up a software engineering org from scratch, it would be (and was at my last gig - I was on the TFS-&gt;Git transition team) my first choice.
Came here for clarifications on why such new feature is already broken on the preview and got this. 
Thanks for the insight. Like I said I’m not heavily invested but was curious if GitHub had much on Bitbucket other than namesake. I’ve really enjoyed my Bitbucket experience and other than a VS issue a few months back have had no issues with my first repo use. I don’t know how I programmed without repos in the past.
It's M$ all over again!!
Butbucket supports Hg as well. Something I wish GitHub and gitlab would do despite their names. Would be nice if they became VCS agnostic.
dammit ms is ruining github! &gt;:( /s 
Not an experienced developer, what does this mean? 
Microsoft for the win!!! Goodbye BitBucket
Automatic fork syncing sounds like a recipe for disaster. Exactly how does it handle merge conflicts? If you claim that git doesn't ever generate merge conflicts, I have about 5 years of experience using git that says otherwise.
I'll be honest, for those kinds of projects, if I'm the only one who has worked on them, they never leave my computer (well... computer or backup) despite still using git repositories for them.
Yeah no, I've seen enough to know better than that. So it's highly dependent on the workflow, which in our case is roughly the following: we have a single collection of trunk branches (in our case, we have develop, release, hotfix, and master), and each developer forks the "trunk" repo. Daily work is merged via pull requests from a branch based on each developer's **fork/develop** branch, to the **trunk/develop**. Trunk branches are almost *NEVER* committed to outside of this process, which is similar for hotfixes. Releases are cut from develop via a PR from trunk/develop to trunk/release, which allows work to continue in develop while a release is being finalized and tested. Once a release goes out, we merge release-&gt;master, master-&gt;hotfix, hotfix-&gt;develop. If a hotfix is required, a PR is made to trunk/hotfix from a dev's fork/hotfix, and once it's released, we downmerge to the other trunk branches from hotfix (we have a very specific order, but I don't remember what it is due to us not having had to do a hotfix in so long :D ). Fork syncing *would* be a disaster, if we synced with each other's forks, but we never do that, we keep our individual forks synced to the trunk/main repo. It's a bit of overhead, but once the team is used to it, things go *much* more smoothly than I've ever seen with any other workflow. As far as merge conflicts, we do get them on a daily basis, but they are almost always &lt; 10 lines, and the correct change to take is generally very obvious. Collaboration to resolve a merge conflict is required on the order of twice a month (I'm not kidding), on a team of ~15 contributors with ~50 very active repositories.
[Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)), for one, but the connection you say that you don't see is simply the behavior. The concept of polymorphism is pretty straight forward - a message is dynamically dispatched based on what is being sent (ad-hoc or parametric) or what is receiving it (subtype/inclusion). Overloading is a type of static polymorphism (referred to as ad-hoc polymorphism in the wiki). &amp;#x200B; I think what you're probably more used to referring to as polymorphism is subtyping/inclusion.
Their doc organization has finally got up to a reasonable par. Msdn pages were so fucking hard to dig through sometimes. 
You spelled buttbucket wrong
They will cloud host your private personal project repositories for free. It used to be free only if the projects were public.
You probably need a tree where each node can contain a list (or even a dictionary) of more nodes.
What are your keys? public class TreeNode : IEnumerable&lt;TreeNode&gt; { public string Value { get; } // empty list = leaf public List&lt;TreeNode&gt; Children { get; } }
Off the top of my head, perhaps have the dictionary value be an object that uses an interface. Then, implement two classes that implement that interface. One of which can have a string "value", and the other a dictionary "value", and the third a nesting "value". Later, if you need the value to be other types, it can be easily extended. 
The github -&gt; JIRA integration is actually really good. I’ve used it with a lot of success. 
Same, and started paying because they were so good giving it for free for so long that I was feeling bad. Still it's way cheaper than GitHub

It is a Virtual DOM with angular-nativescript, vue-nativescript or react-native that does the magic.

Why though? It's perfectly reasonable to run a site hosting repositories for just one version/revision control system. And as you pointed the name wouldn't make sense anymore.
It doesn't make that much sense to provide free private repos without the same basic features as public ones. Unless you know they're plan on shitting on the pre-existing free public repos in the hear future by cutting them back the same way too...
In my personal experience, keep your REST API in .NET Core and add to it SignalR. With SignalR you can execute functions on your client, any that are listening that is. For example if you have an Angular app, or any other javascript or node framework front end, you can create a connection to a SignalR Hub on your API and it we begin a bidirectional connection. You can then send data from the front end to your API either through the Hub or through an API controller post. Within the SignalR Hub you can execute a seperate .dll file that is executing the math operations, you can either stream these results or push them to the front when completed, as well as save them into the database via dependency injection to the SignalR Hub. 
Why not is a better question. A name alone isn't a good enough reason, imo, and it'd still work with git. The way I look at it is that if a new VCS came out and became popular, does GitHub just close shop? Launch a whole new service? Or just support the new tool?
Ehhhh. This is a classic MS strategy to take over the market. I hope it continues to go well, but I don't like anyone who takes over too much of the market. That doesn't breed innovation. 
Hey, good afternoon/day/night Could you explain what is the use case for it? I never really understood why you would need a message broker or even how do they work. &amp;#x200B; thanks!

Australia's backdoor law is enough of a reason to drop bitbucket...
Still the 1GB limit though right? So is there any reason to use them over gitlab?
It's not like the hobby coder is really their money maker anyway. The real cash is in the enterprise and professional hosting. This just encourages hobbyist coders to make it their standard so that they will keep pushing it if they move to a paid job.
Let's define what kind of magic that we are talking about. I am concerned with the productivity of the human programmer. For more than ten years, I was a Smalltalk programmer and could put together complex GUI's in the space of a few hours. Of course, Smalltalk bit the dust a couple of decades ago and so I moved on to Web programming. So, my focus is how to get more deliverable output for each hour spent coding. What you seem to be referring to is machine productivity - making the browser rendering process faster and less resource intensive. These are not mutually opposed goals. I can easily adjust the code generation to include/exclude any JavaScript libraries or CSS libraries. For example, in the online demo, I include Bootstrap CSS for the "WebSite Mode" and I also include Google JavaScript libraries for code C# formatting and for loading fonts. When it makes sense to include angular.js or vue.js or any other technology, I would be happy to do so. CSharpWebExpress has no built-in restrictions on what kind of code gets built. The are classes that wrap Qooxdoo for the Windows and general layout with flex boxes, splitters etc. There are other classes that wrap Bootstrap for responsive page layout - look at the main page of the demo and make the browser very narrow and you will see what I mean. There are also CSharp classes that wrap the Qooxdoo mobile libraries. And I have classes under development for wrapping Paper.js which is great for games. But to the developer building applications, it is all just CSharp code. Press a button and the machine does the rest. To summarize: -- what gets built could be Angular, Vue, Qooxdoo, or WASM -- but the application developer only has to code in CSharp 
Sounds great. On the rendering process, how does it compare to Xamarin rendering? It sounds almost the same, having a standardized UI library with specialized renderers for different platforms.
I feel like you could always right some logic that says max downloads concurrently is like 3 or something and store all the urls in a queue and then only process 3 at a time.
Except GitHub isn’t an open source fork of anything.
Only a bunch of morons would integrate their product so far deep up some other retards library.
Yeah I agree fuck Microsoft for giving us free stuff and moving technology forward.
Gitlab is a joke.
&gt;The goal is that everyone working on the code can write in such a way that you can't tell who wrote what code by style alone. Personally I actually like programmers having slight differences in their code so you can identify who wrote what without having to go into source control. I'm not talking major differences, just minor things that no body should be really fussed about... You have to have a bit of give and take with coding styles. n.b. I use the microsoft standard as much as possible. n.n.b. Using hanging braces in C# is blasphemy. They should have mentioned that in the job interview and you should have told them to go DIAF.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Gitlab? Are you fucking kidding lmfao.
thanks /u/KryptosFR I didn't thought of this, I might be able to use this for the whole initialization block of my code.
Many would and that's fine. When I joined the company there was zero structure or processes in place for development, no source control, sticky note todo lists for customer feature requests, the works. This, strangely, is the lesser of two evils.
You can also use Hangfire for running background jobs in a Windows service.
Only a moron would think atlassian is a library.
How about using an anonymous object and nest it inside of there?
This is a very fragile scenario because it assumes that you can keep your socket open for the entire transaction. What if your client switches from wi-fi to 4g while processing? What if your server restarts and has to restart the processing? You are depending on synching state between your web server and a client device for 30+ seconds -- scary.
This is the purpose for which I suggest writing an IHostedService implementation if the scale is small. If the scale is large then definitely move it out of process.
Bidirectional dependency in a client-server architecture is a code smell and can seriously compromise maintainability and extensibility. Generally, your server should make no assumptions about the client implementation. Further reading: [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://www.google.com/search?q=dependency+inversion+principle&amp;oq=dependency+inversion+principle&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.6876j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
I think the best way would be to integrate SignalR, so that you can report progress to the client in real-time, and then the client doesn't have to poll. In some ways, I think this would be simpler than the above solution. If the work succeeds, you can use SignalR to send the result's location to the client, then the client can GET it.

I had to do something similar to rate limit my requests to Amazon SES. I add my requests into the database for persistent storage. Very important if you're queueing things up, since you don't want to lose the queue if the process ends for whatever reason. You can set up an infinite loop on its own thread where you await a cancellation token infinitely. When you add new work into the DB, cancel the token, and then your code can check the DB for a request to send. Send the request, sleep for a bit, and check again for another request. If nothing is there, go back to sleep, and repeat. In your case, you probably want to store in-memory the last time a particular API was hit, so that you know if you've waited long enough. Also, you wouldn't want to sleep infinitely, but if you're only hitting Google Drive every 40 seconds, and you've got 20 left, then sleep for 20 seconds. If you've sent everything, then you can sleep infinitely, so that your thread remains dormant until you cancel the token again to wake it up. Remember replace your token after cancelling it. You could set up a thread for each endpoint, then the sleeping will be simple.
I think you need to get the basics of the language down. Methods in C# are private by default, so "void start" and "private void start" are the same thing. I don't consider myself to know that much about Unity. I think many people make the mistake of jumping straight in without learning to program anything. If you want to learn C#, I recommend starting where I did, which is with Venkat's tutorials: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105) As a new programmer, I learnt so much from that series. It really helped to get me going, and teach me how things worked. He simplifies everything. However, the PlayerController is what controls your character, e.g. movement. Saying GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;() will get the Animator component from the current GameObject and store it in anim. You can set the Animator component in the Inspector. Unity's tutorials will teach you about GameObjects, the Inspector, Animators and more, but programming-wise, Venkat's tutorial is much better, in my opinion, than the ones Unity has.
Dunno, the LINQ to XML api is pretty darn smooth.
Resource files is meant for this. You can [set the UICulture to german](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WATZ39pfnVM) and it'll use your Resources.de.resx file to look up the resource.
Well, their purpose is mainly to move forward your tendency to use their platforms, ultimately ending up with Azure which makes them money. 
For AWS I listen for the rate limiting status code (429 Too Many Requests). When I get that I pause requests for a random amount of time and keep retrying (with longer waits each time) until I'm allowed to poll the service again.
Yes, sorry, it wasn't a dig at you, rather an observation that everything is JSON now :)
The funny thing is, the MSDN was still always better than almost everyone else's docs. Which isn't saying much. Any company who think documentation is autogenerated Javadoc style crap with zero usage instructions can go to hell!
I used to do that back when SVN was still a thing. I just ran my own SVN server at home. The nice things about a hosted private service, I can more easily use more than one computer without resorting to a network drive and I can access code from work just in case I wanted to. 
🙌 In no way at all does devalue a star :)
Giveth example: using static Giveth.Steps [Test] public async Task SomeTest { Given("some precondition"); ... And("and another precondition"); ... When("something happens"); ... Assert.Multiple(() =&gt; { Then("something should be true"); ... And("so should something else"); ... }); } 
You can have a Dictionary&lt;string,object&gt; but you lose the type safety and will have to check types and cast appropriately as needed &amp;#x200B;
I cannot reproduce that behavior. A simple test I did updates fine both while dragging and with a context menu open. You'll need to show us some code.
Wow.. Who needs more than that? Are you backing up databases on it? Just curious...
Or you know their competitors could adapt and do the same thing. 
Yes... that doesn't change what their purpose is. Huge corporations can do things that is difficult to compete with for smaller players.
yeah will do there is no chance to fuk this up with payment stuff :D .
Every single time you call `.Add()` it triggers an update and as a result a redraw. You better want to add all new elements at once. Unfortunately the `ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;` itself does not support this feature, so you need to add your own type: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45364074
Thanks for reply.... I found the stackoverflow link a bit complated too understand, but thanks for your reply.
Do you often **add** new elements? Or do you more often just update elements? The first section of my comment is more relevant when you often add elements. The second section is more relevant when you mostly update.
Both add and updates, it depends sometimes. I tried to do: Categories.ToDictionary(x =&gt; x.id); Categories[DesiredID]; When it doesn't find the key (desiredID), it returns an error. How can I avoid this? What I want to do is if it doesn't find the key in the dictionary, it should add instead.
&gt; When it doesn't find the key (desiredID), it returns an error. How can I avoid this? Well, yeah. The indexer throws if the key is not found. You solve this by checking the documentation of the dictionary class. Look for a method that does what you want: Check if an element with the key exists, and if yes: retrieve it.
Good god. Mount Ballmore is going to appear in my nightmares.
So I started building this on my PC and made it as a windows form app, easy enough, I created a login page and all the other pages I need but... &amp;#x200B; I am having trouble with the SQL table I have create and getting the app to dump the info into the table it keeps telling my there is issues with my column names or definitions, but when I check everything looks ok. also I want it to create a Unique Customer ID every time you enter a new customer Eg Customer 1 has ID 1 Customer 2 Has ID 2 etc Please help or guide me to the correct place to learn this. this is my code using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel; using System.Data; using System.Drawing; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Data.SqlClient; using System.Configuration; namespace MySmartGarage { public partial class NewCustomers : System.Windows.Forms.Form { SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection((@"Data Source=DESKTOP-D7G231F\MSSQLSERVER01;Initial Catalog=MySmartGarage;Integrated Security=True")); public NewCustomers() { InitializeComponent(); } private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void label2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void label3_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void label4_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void label5_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void textBox4_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void btnExit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { this.Close(); } private void txtCustomerLastName_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void btnAddAccount_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { try { con.Open(); SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("insert into Customer('" + txtCarReg + "','" + txtEmail + "','" + txtFirstName + "','" + txtHouseName + "','" + txtLastName + "', '" + txtPostcode + "','" + txtStreet + "''" + txtPhone + "''" + txtCity + "')", con); cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); txtBusinessName.Text = ""; txtCity.Text = ""; txtPhone.Text = ""; txtStreet.Text = ""; txtPostcode.Text = ""; txtLastName.Text = ""; txtHouseName.Text = ""; txtFirstName.Text = ""; txtEmail.Text = ""; txtCarReg.Text = ""; MessageBox.Show("Customer Added"); } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); } try { } finally { con.Close(); } } private void NewCustomers_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void label13_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void textBox1_TextChanged_1(object sender, EventArgs e) { } } } &amp;#x200B;
Yeah I noticed too. But VSCode have come a long way - now the settings actually have GUI. When you're manually editing these things I agree XML can be a pain, but once we get to the GUI level then I'm back to wanting robust APIs to handle the configuration.

This is why Adobe and every other major app developer would be smart to have a free, functional version of their apps. Get creators into the ecosystem early and get them to rely on it.
[I had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14)
Their API docs are technically correct and thorough, but to me, a hobbyist, they are not very accessible and they are lacking in simple examples. I always use other sites for examples.
My understanding of Xamarin.Forms is that they use Mono primitives to do the rendering. In the case of CSharpWebExpress all that is being produced is JavaScript. The actual rendering would be done by the host browser engine when it renders the DOM elements. In some of my lower level classes, I do have methods for "rendering" but they are simply creating DOM elements, not actually putting pixels on the screen.
Removed: Rule 5.
Removed: Rule 4. If you're looking to make a simple game, probably best bet is to dive into Unity3D and the learning resources they have over at https://unity3d.com/learn and at /r/Unity3D If you're looking to make non-3D games and learn the very basics, there are learning resources in the sidebar (especially the "C# Fundamentals: Development for Absolute Beginners" which is a free video series by Bob Tabor) or at /r/learnprogramming.
The custom ID should just be handled by your DB when creating the column just set it to Auto Incriment.
Ok thanks 
I'm a junior web developer. I have some experience in front end technologies and they hired me on the contingency that I learn c\# so I can start working on the back end
Take a look at the .editorconfig support - that's pretty decent these days, and has the ability to create warnings for bad code style.
&gt; Add AppVeyor nuget feed source to local environment (please ask for the credentials) That's a pretty big barrier to entry.
I hate K&amp;R style, personally. That’s just aesthetics, though. The only language I know of that actually matters is JavaScript. Otherwise, either way compiles just fine. The more important thing is readability, which comes from consistency and following conventions. Practically speaking, that means always use Allman in C# and always use K&amp;R for Java. Why? Convention. You should also always use PascalCase methods names in C# and camelCase method names in Java (as examples). Don’t be cute and try to add your own style that runs counter to convention.
But keep in mind that the Task is not killed. It will continue to run, even if you don't listen to result anymore.
Have you considered shader-like rendering for terminals? I'm doing some prototyping work with text shaders for MUDs (text-based multiplayer games) which might overlap with this. You may also want to look into the Entity-Component-System pattern for organising your game objects to make the engine more flexible.
Can System.IO, running via Blazor in the client, not access local files? I would have thought that’s how I’d do it. Also, remember that Blazor is still even experimental, and only it’s highly nerfed version (the non-wasm server side Blazor) is slated to be in Net Core 3 (which itself is still in preview) I think it’s future all hinges on how well the team pulls off full AoT compilation to WASM.
&gt; Can System.IO, running via Blazor in the client, not access local files? That would be a pretty massive security risk, wouldn't it?
I prefer the second approach. I like to return immediately when the rest of the code can't be executed.
Ive been using Azure DevOps for this reason, they have provided free private git repos for a long time now. 
Its perfectly valid to reverse check and sometimes good too. Keeps away neesting if statments and unnecessary code execution.
Awesome, I can finally start new projects without being ashamed and later change them to public when I feel more confident with my code
What's the problem with Gitlab? I prefer it over Bitbucket
InvokeOnUIThread(() =&gt; this.IsLoading = false, this.text = "test" ); Do you know if I can set multiple variable value with this line?
Just... Have multiple statements in a code block...? Do you have a beginners C# book? If you don't have one, then I'd highly suggest you to get one.
Are you talking about something like [that](https://youtu.be/IEbFwDv1RHU)? If yes, that can be a thing in a distant future. I'll definitely check Entity-Component-System. It's look like Unity is build that way.
Either way is just as valid. Also, you can check ModelState multiple times. Aka... 1. If valid, get some data. 2. If condition on data, add modelstate error. 3. If valid, do some saving or other stuff. 4. If you reach the end, then it must be invalid, return view with validation errors. Basically, it is flexible enough to do all kinds of patterns for whatever fits that controller's action the best.
Convert to XML then store that a giant string in your code somewhere. Then you can load that into an XML object at runtime and query it with LINQ Or you can just use a basic dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;. It’ll accept any objects as a value, but then you’ll have to manually type check when you read our values. Like this: if[dict[0] is string varName) ... if(dict[0] is dictionary&lt;,&gt; varName) ...
It lacks robustness for very large projects that bitbucket and github handle excellently
Not so much rendering perspective 3D models to an ANSI terminal, more applying shader effects to text rendering. You have code for a Border object, for example - as it's purely a visual effect, that could be added to a given text "sprite" in shaders. You could render colour shimmer or reflections in the scene as visual effects rather than adding all that render logic to every game object.
If I'll figure out how to apply shader-like rendering, then sure. It would be a great feature. But i'm not so familiar with shaders etc. I will probably rewrite everything to ECS as you mentioned, so Border will be simple added as separate component. That's again for pointing me ECS! 
While it is really all preference and consistency is key. I have always used strictly Allman style with C#, no matter what. However, when doing JS, for example, I will go strictly K&amp;R.
Correct me if I'm wrong (I just got back to C# after a year of using other languages), but the purpose of Blazor isn't to replace JS, it's to offer the ability to write reactive applications with C#, like Vue/React/Angular. Blazor just handles the reactive system, if you want custom JS interaction outside of that you'll have to use interops. Of course Blazor and all of its extensions it will probably build a large enough of an eco system that you can build basic modern web apps without touching JS, but it will probably take a while.
No worries, glad it helped; you might also want to look at existing vector libraries to save yourself a lot of boiler-plate. System.Numerics has vector types for floats, but that may not be ideal for integer-coordinate terminals; I'm a fan of GlmSharp which has a full range of float, int, uint, etc. vectors, though I don't think they've published a package for .NET Core/Standard yet. Speaking of which, it'll be worth publishing NuGet packages of your project when you're happy to publicly release.
... or just use Newtonsoft and just avoid XML altogether....
I have almost finished Vector2, so it's too late. Also I'm trying to make this as thin as I can and that lib looks big. But I'll looks closely to it I know, releasing on NuGet is must have! Maybe version 0.3.0 will be on NuGet :)
Wrap each behaviour in a rule type with two methods; ShouldExecute &amp; Execute. Add rules in a list, sorted by priority. Call ShouldExecute (passing the set of outdata information flags) on each rule to decide if that's the one to use, then call Execute on the first that returns true. To extend this, simply define a new rule type with a ShouldExecute &amp; Execute implementation, and at it to the correct point in the rule list.
Thanks for your feedback! &amp;#x200B; Releases are available in [nuget.org](https://nuget.org). But packages for feature branches get published to a nuget feed in AppVeyor. I will check if I can make it easier to contribute by making AppVeyor nuget feed publicly available. Also I will update readme file to make sure that section is not misleading. I just realized it looks like the steps for usage of the package.
The second approach is definitely cleaner and the better way to go. Conditions that stop execution should always be run first. That being said, I would recommend you take a look at doing your validation with a filter so you don't have to run ModelState.IsValid every time.
yeah that was the one thing I thought of. Basically add services to a List&lt;Task&lt;Something&gt;&gt; and then do result = await Task.WhenAll(tasks.where(t =&gt; t.ShouldCall).Call(input))... my question is how do I wrap the Input and how do I create the list?
I mean until this year adobe was basically free. The amtlib.dll was such an easy target for years over multiple versions, and it seemed like they dont care at all about security. Not sure how the new system works tho
Reduce if-else and if statements as much as possible.
What information would be typically passed to the webservices? Do the results of those calls need reconciled in some way - e.g. call A makes a change to the person's data, call B makes a different change; can those changes just be applied in sequence, or do they need merging? For creating the list, you can go as simple as a static method that just returns hard-coded, pre-populated list, or something more complicated like adding attributes to any rule types and then reflecting over currently loaded assemblies to generate the list.
Your syntax is sorta broken, as-is, and I'm not sure you can do what you want without reflection. And the reflection is kinda ugly. object BuiltList(object o) { return Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(List&lt;&gt;).MakeGenericType(o.GetType())); }
This is most likely not what you want. As you have your obj variable you also know the type of obj. Therefore you could just specify the type at compile time instead of resolving this at runtime
I dunno, here's the more complex version of what I'm doing. Basically, user passes in ANY object, and I grab the "pool" based on that object's type, and then attempt to insert the object into it. However, I'm not able to cast into the generic type to do what I'm trying. public void Release(object obj) { var key = obj.GetType(); if (!_pools.ContainsKey(key)) { var genericPool = typeof(SinglePool&lt;&gt;).MakeGenericType(key); _pools.Add(key, genericPool); } ((SinglePool&lt;obj.GetType&gt;)_pools[key]).Put(obj); // &lt;-- this is where the problem is. }
Thanks! I'd actually gotten that far, but it was more about USING this object that I was having trouble with. Please see response to other commentor.
the input is definitely static - a single string. The output of each call however is a different object that needs to be merged into a single big object that needs to be returned. As for your suggestions about the list, the second one (reflection) sounds more elegant but a lot less performant, so we'll probably go with a static method that accepts a... configuration object that says which calls needs to be made? We will have to and update the properties of this object as well I guess
C# console class is going to be quite slow... if it were .net framework I'd recommend p/invoking Console commands... You need some wrapper for cureses or similar... from what I understand from research in the past is that the linux console can be a pain to get ahold of because it isn't standardized like the windows console. &amp;#x200B; In any case, I don't believe you will be able to obtain good frame rates without utilizing native libraries. &amp;#x200B;
Only thing I do is use "Application.Idle += HandleApplicationIdle;" for the game loop like this... void HandleApplicationIdle(object sender, EventArgs e) { while (IsApplicationIdle()) _form.GameLoop(GetDeltaTime(), GetFps()); } bool IsApplicationIdle() { NativeMessage result; return PeekMessage(out result, IntPtr.Zero, (uint)0, (uint)0, (uint)0) == 0; } And in the GameLoop is where all the logic updates and Control.Invalidate() (for drawing) happens.
IIRC, you can use unobtrusive client-side validation on .NET Core. Some don't like it due to the use of jQuery, some other don't like due to the use of data annotations on your models, but I find it the easiest way of validating form data beforing POSTing.
I know. That's why I mentioned CurseSharp. It's a wrapper for curses lib. I was also thinking about using P/Invoke some C++ libs, but not right now. Still thanks for pointing it out. 
If your generic type extends or implements a non-generic interface, you could cast to the non-generic interface for supported operations. For List&lt;T&gt;, say, we could cast up to IList. If you don't mind using `dynamic`, you might be able to do what you want by assigning your generic object to a `dynamic` variable. Maybe. I think the type inference is likely to be gross. You could also use some more reflection to find the method you want and invoke it. var pool = _pools[key]; pool.GetType().GetMethod("Put", new [] { key }).Invoke(pool, new [] { obj }); All of this assumes your method gets supplied object references, rather than something more specific. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/7m0r0x/simultanous_console_input_and_output/drvapru/?context=3 This has some code for .net framework console manipulation. 
Very good answer. Only nitpick: a queue (MSMQ or whatever) is arguably more correct mechanism than a stub record in a database. The message processing updates the entity. If the entity is in a transactional store, XA can be used to get rid of the message alongside the entity update. But now we have XA use.
In addition to the horrible reflection business, you could try caching the put calls, once they're built. *Or* you could add a non-generic interface to SinglePool&lt;T&gt; to expose Put(object), and cast to that, if you have that much control over the code involved.
&gt; pool.GetType().GetMethod("Put", new [] { key }).Invoke(pool, new [] { obj }); I actually went down this rabbit hole for a minute, but couldn't figure out how to get a return from .GetMethod. It always returns "null". 
This is from thanksgiving.
I don't really know much about this stuff but I have previously done a little digging in this area and the library that always came up was [libcotd](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/src/default/). I don't think this is in active development but the original author has started another [project using Rust](https://github.com/jice-nospam/doryen-rs). I quickly googled and found a [.net version](https://github.com/FaronBracy/RogueSharp) and I'm sure there are more.
holy shit thats awesome!
&gt; Or you could add a non-generic interface to SinglePool&lt;T&gt; to expose Put(object), and cast to that Hrm. Could you explain this a bit more? Adding a SinglePool() would be possible so long as the functionality of the root class could remain the same. 
I just tried this and it seems to work: &gt; class SinglePool&lt;T&gt; { public void Put(T x) { } } &gt; object pool = new SinglePool&lt;int&gt;(); &gt; pool.GetType().GetMethod("Put", new[] { typeof(int), }).Invoke(pool, new object [] { 1 }); Maybe try some different binding flags?
Sounds like a job for [VBA](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43613883) instead of C# if you ask me.
This may help you. It's not a complete solution but should get you close. https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/linq-to-excel-in-action/ 
You'd have to modify SinglePool&lt;T&gt; to implement the new interface, but that would look something like interface ISinglePool { void Put(object obj); } class SinglePool&lt;T&gt; : ISinglePool { void ISinglePool.Put(object obj) { // naive comparison, but works as long as you aren't dynamically loading assemblies // be sure to add a message to this error, just in case it ever gets thrown. // if you're really sure it never, ever occurs, you could replace it with an assertion. if (obj.GetType() != typeof(T)) { throw new ArgumentException(nameof(obj)); } this.Put((T) obj); } public void Put(T object) { /* return object to the pool */ } } 
hopefully there's no catch, like being forced to give royalties to MS for any project in on Github. 
the problem is that generics need to be defined at compile time. you cant do SinglePool&lt;obj.GetType&gt; you need to use reflection if you want to go that route. Its not tested but did you try something like this: ((Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(SinglePool) .MakeGenericType(obj.GetType())))_pools[key]).Put(obj);
I have used annotation and fluent api, but i don't know why some doesn't like annotation, short and easy to read
How about something like this ``` public static T CreateGenericClass&lt;T&gt;(T obj) { }
Unless I'm mistaken you can use the Authorize attribute and set the Roles property like so using a comma delimited value: \[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,User")\] 
Yes, that's what I'm doing right now. My issue is that any changes to that require that I modify the code and re-deploy.
Yep, you were on the right track. Apparently my creation of the generic dictionary was flawed. Digging into that now.
Can you describe what these changes are?
Very true. They start to become more accessible the more you know. Their examples are a bit contrived sometimes too. The socket server stuff is poor.
Adding or removing groups from the list of roles to authorize.
&gt; People think the web is put together with duct tape and bungee cords Some of it is actually duck type, but near enough ;) We had this discussion at work recently, sort of inter-departmental pow-wow. The general consensus was negative. And you're partly right, a lot of us grew up with the stuff and do not have fond memories of it :) We provide APIs that are consumed enterprise wide, pretty much all REST, some GraphQL coming in and some real time stuff. We produce, they consume, so for us producing some JSON is simple. Inside our app (apps) when they chat, the JSON is parsed directly into classes, so in that sense there is some validation. If it's malformed it won't parse. We're more interested in validating things like counterparty IDs are real and so on. If we were doing something like exchanging information with an external company, XML with schemas would probably come up simply because it's almost self documenting. That said, I hate self documenting stuff because of all the crappy JavaDoc style documentation out there :)
I remember reading that on a book, which I don't remember the name nor the author.. lol After a few minutes trying to recall the reasons... I think, from what the author said, it's actually a good advice and unrelated to this case... something along the lines of this: it is better to avoid data annotations on domain entities when using EF due to its tendency to break the separation between the data access layers and business logic. 
Haven't seen a use case like this before if I'm understanding properly what you want. You will have to do something custom with an Authorize filter probably. You would also need to store which groups are allowed for which route in some sort of configuration file or table since it sounds like you want to change this on the fly. You can then cache the values in a dictionary or something and dump it when your source changes. From there you would check the claims for the role against the route values and redirect to 401 if they aren't authorized.
It’s still an announcement.
Eat shit and die
I think you were right until your summary. Instead - "In summary, the original values on my entity should be set to the values from the database." Aka, since the operation failed due to a concurrency issue, update my local entity to match what the source of truth (the database) has.
Oh goody, JSON instead of XML, what a revolutionary concept! It doesn’t make a different which serialization format is being used, he still needs to convert from text to runtime objects
Maybe you want to try mygamma.io . It has a good FAQ with a first start guide here. [https://help.mygamma.io/guides/](https://help.mygamma.io/guides/) It is a tool that provides static code analysis with an additional dimension because it helps you to resolve architectural issues as well as code issues. Since it is free for open source projects, you can try it for free easily. Just to be fair I work for them, since a few days as a consultant.
Unless you can find a library if custom auth types (I don't know of any of the to of my head), you're going to have to roll your own. Attribute usage basically locks you into using only compile-time primitive constants, so you need a custom implementation that you pass a constant key into to look up values in a config file or DB table. I've been doing something similar this week, with the added fun of needing to fetch values from the parameter list to use as arguments in the query to the DB.
Most people i know use RES, which comes with a toggle button.
The issue is that there is no way to bring up a file dialog. You can easily load in files that exist on the server, but the client can’t upload a file without some seemingly heavy JS interop, which is what my question is about. Core 3 will have client-side Blazor eventually, though.
And most people never use it. 
I don’t recall if I used this one exactly or not in the past but I think it was http://www.jigar.net/articles/viewhtmlcontent324.aspx 
Pretty sure you're statement on core 3 including blazor is a wild guess as I haven't seen any official commitment from microsoft on this (although I'd love it to happen!) 
The purpose of Blazor is to offer full-stack web development in .NET (C#). Blazor components will be .NET wrappers around JS libraries. Blazor depends on JS interop for bootstrapping, and also because WASM doesn’t have DOM manip. since it’s still in MVP, which is hopefully only a temporary hindrance while the WASM people work on the GC.
&gt;Is it really worth using Blazor apps if Razor pages can do all of this? Well, first of all, given how early-stages Blazor is, the "is it worth it" question can almost unequivocally be answered 'no'. You don't want to rely on it for a production-ready website. Beyond that, it depends on what your goal is. Blazor is a single-page application framework like Angular or Vue. Essentially, if you want to do a web _site_, use Razor Pages, MVC, etc. If you want a web _app_, use Blazor, Angular, etc. For a web site, users will be navigating through different pages, each individually indexed by search engines, and whathaveyou. For a web app, there's a single 'page' that exists as a wrapper to run an app, and that app then performs additional requests are made to APIs to fetch data (but not entire pages).
&gt;"In summary, the original values on my entity should be set to the values from the database." So it is actually the database value that overwrites the proposed value? Ok, thanks for making that clear. So if you wanted to make the client win, meaning that the proposed value should overwrite the database value, would you do it like this?: entry.GetDatabaseValues().SetValues(entry.OriginalValues);
That's fairly vague. Care to elaborate?
What the hell?
Game Dev, especially prototyping. Being able to commit/use assets without having from an external source is quite nice when doing the early prototype of a game. 3D Models &amp; music eat up space quickly. Sure once you get funding for the project you will start to pay for space needed, but having 10 GB to begin with is really helpful when you're just getting started.
I think I just figured something out. The value that was proposed is not stored within `OriginalValues`, but with `entry.CurrentValues`, right. So my question would be, if a conflict happens, and I want to save the current values (proposed values), would I do it like this? entry.GetDatabaseValues().SetValues(entry.CurrentValues);
Hmmm.. Valid reasons, I think. There's probably a workaround to that, kinda like using some cloud service that offers good space at the free tier and allows sharing. You put the share link on your repo and then someone else can mount the cloud server as an OS drive. lol
Depends. Do these shits have more than 256 columns? 
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/02/blazor-0-6-0-experimental-release-now-available/ It’s in there. They’re working on client-side while server-side ships with the initial Core 3 release. At this point I know I need to use JS interop, but my question is what I’m supposed to be passing to my C# code. Do I pass a base64 string/byte array/pathname, etc?
You need to get your hands on a windows laptop you can use for this course. Sorry but it just doesn't run on mac.
One workaround would be to give SinglePool&lt;T&gt; a non-generic method public void Put(object obj); ..and put it under an interface IPool. Then the implementation of SinglePool&lt;T&gt; can simply cast the object to T, which is guaranteed to succeed given your usage. Then in this code, you can either cast to IPool or change your dictionary _pools to be of type &lt;Type, IPool&gt;
Desktop app development Core is limited to .Net Core 3.0 on VS2019 both of which are in preview (not yet released). Unfortunately, the designer isn't working yet, so you have to do it all in code. The pretty GUI you saw for building is only available for .Net Framework, which doesn't work on Mac. Your best bet is probably to dual-boot into Windows and develop there. What's the Mac term for that? 
That link doesn't say anything about client side blazor being officially supported yet. I know server side blazor is being included and I know client side is still under very active development. As far as the blazor upload goes, my 2 example projects both pass the file contents as base 64 strings and it works perfectly. I'll try to remember to come back here after work and put an example up
Thanks! I was trying something similar and that P/Invoke throw an Exception, because kernel32.dll was not on Linux. It's possibly only Windows lib. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
&gt; What's the Mac term for that? BootCamp
Visual studio is available for Mac, but may not have all the graphical UI tools of the PC version. Nonetheless, it’s largely possible to achieve the same results using the Mac version. In addition, JetBrains also have a cross platform IDE for c#. Good luck with the course!
Okay so I have almost no experience with C# on a Mac but as far as I remember MonoDevelop has libraries for GUI creation. Not exactly sure about how good they are. But how did you get around joining a C# course with a mac getting this far and no one mentioning anything about limitations?
That makes sense! Thank you! I'm going to check out that channel right now.
Thanks. :) 
What's wrong with SignalR? That's what it's for.
If SignalR doesn't work for you, then perhaps some inter-process communication using shared memory? I've used this before for communicating between a console app and local webserver. [Polymorphic serialization](https://github.com/rogeralsing/Wire) [Shazam IPC](https://github.com/hhblaze/SharmIPC) [Shared Memory Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharedMemory/)
SignalR was an ASP.NET product, i thought, and asp net doesn’t like the .dlls we need to use to talk to the cache 
Hi guys. I've got a 87 Honda motorcycle and I want to fly it like a plane. Any idea how I may get this to work? (sorry to sound like a turd, but it's oil and water, yo)
There's lots of ways of achieving GUIs on MacOS. You could go the web-route and develop web-applications, using things like Angular and React. If you hook those up to Electron it *can* feel a lot like a desktop application. Hooking it up with a .NET Core backend is pretty easy too. That said, if your professor used a specific GUI tool, I'm guessing it's something like Windows Forms, in which case **you're probably better off using Bootcamp to run Windows.**

There is Xamarin.Mac. Never used it, but might be worth a try? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/mac/
Yea thats what came to my mind
Like any company, they are trying to make money. I will start to worry when that's no longer the case.
Does SignalR handle the case when a socket is unexpectedly closed? Let's say iPhone Andy decides to switch to 4g during the wait -- do we handle it gracefully in this case?
Great! Last week, I just paid for a yearly membership for this feature.
OP do this, it's pretty straight forward and you can use get VS community for free. If you're in college you can prolly get a copy of windows for free (or torrent cough)
There is an [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) cross platform UI library, which you can run on .net core. Also Xamarin as mentioned before. 
Sure, I’m saying that monoculture isn’t always good for the consumer in the long term. 
Thanks for the suggestions everyone!
Blazor is not full stack, its a single page web app framework. To do full stack in .NET you would still need ASP.NET Core running on the server with Web API, or to create a web application with no backend (or use it together with any other kind of backend, if you want). &gt; Blazor components will be .NET wrappers around JS libraries. It's more accurate to say that Blazor has a JS library that is part of it's runtime for DOM manipulation. It's components are created as Razor templates with C# code, they aren't wrappers around JS.
&gt; From what I’ve seen, there is some significant overhead with the wasm compilation that seems to oftentimes negate the performance gains. What makes you think there would be performance gains to using an unoptimized experimental single page app framework on a new unoptimized platform (Mono WASM)? The Blazor team themselves have admitted the performance is not great yet, for many reasons.
Folks have already given you good advice to use Bootcamp to install a Windows partition. If you need to buy a copy of Windows cheap, search for OEM copies of Windows 10 online. You can get a legit copy of Windows in a download for under $30 usually.
&gt;322 comments Same for me, just install the app on Jira and you're good to go.
Go back to stack overflow bro, it’s literally on the Blazor website: https://blazor.net
Yeah I didn’t say supported, I said released later.
When I had projects like this in school, I installed VMware Fusion on my Mac and booted into windows. My university gave us copies of VMware for free.
Instead of using message boxes place a breakpoint (right click on a line and click insert breakpoint) and you can step through your code line by line, maybe it'll shed some light on your issue.
What database provider is this? SQL Server? PostgreSQL? SQLlite? Something else? Have you tried wrapping this in a transaction? Can you create a small program that calls this method and then post the complete program here or upload it someplace and give us a link to it?
https://blazor.net
I'm using SQL server, I'm not sure what a transaction is, sorry. I have a way of calling my method in a controlled way, but I don't have a separate program to do it, however from my other tests done there is literally nothing to post because the update doesn't affect anything.
All I'm saying is that the status of the client side blazor project is listed as experimental. There is nothing saying that it will be released in the future. I don't mean to argue but as someone using blazor, its fairly important to know that the whole project COULD (although unlikely at the moment) be tossed in the trash by Microsoft at essentially any time. 
Yes, I've used the breakpoints too, sorry didn't mention them in the main post
Doesn't the using statement automatically open the connection? Why do you need to open it again? Maybe try surrounding this with a try catch and see if you get an exception in the catch? Put a breakpoint in the catch and you might be able to get more info to provide us. 
If the client loses connection, then on the client side, you should make a request to check if they missed out on anything.
I am merely stating that when you run Blazor on the server side then you are relying on both Blazor and ASP.NET Core, and that Blazor only handles the portions that render your UI and pass application state. Blazor is not full stack, Blazor + ASP.NET Core is.
I'd just do the CustomAuthorize. I had a project where I tied Roles to a Permissions table (Controller/Action combination) and that worked pretty well. So my users ended up having a set of Roles, that each have a set of Permissions. Of course, you have to set up permissions for all Roles then, and this hits your database an additional time per request. Tradeoffs. This does, however, let me decorate controllers with a [FoobarAuthorize] and let my db do the work of seeing which Roles/Permissions allow a user to hit some action.
Haven't executed your code, but to me it looks like problem is in the where clause. At first, why where clause is open for SQL injection? Every other data is supplied by SQL parameters, but parentId is just slapped in to sql string. You can just add another sql parameter for parentId, and change where clause to something like this "WHERE ParentId = @ParentId". And if you don't want to add parameter, change SQL script of where clause to this "WHERE ParentId = '" + parent.parentId.ToString() + "'"; &amp;#x200B;
You can also similarly create a custom Policy that contains user roles: [Authorize(Policy= "AdminPolicy")]
Homework?
Three things. 1. Pull the sql query out as text and run it in sql management studio if you can. If you’re getting into a quagmire, separating out parts of the program and testing them separately will help. If you can run that query in management studio and it works and updates that record you at least know the problem is in C# 2. While debugging, go to your exception settings in visual studio and turn on ALL of the CLR exceptions to throw https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/managing-exceptions-with-the-debugger?view=vs-2017 3. I won’t pretend to know your experience level but PLEASE make that ID in the where clause a parameter also. Leaving it as plaintext added on to the end of a query is how you get caught with a SQL injection attack. It doesn’t matter if this is for you and only you, you never know when a project you create might take off or be used elsewhere and if you leave a small security hole like that you’ll regret it. If you say I’ll fix it later just remember, “later means never”. Hope this helps
I wish it was, I am learning all this for a hobby and using my friends garage as a platform, so I am trying to make an app for him and his customers. Seemed simple enough but been along process of learning and getting stuck along the way! 
This is great advice here! I use this same technique all the time for my db headaches. Comparing what it is actually happening to whatever I think is happening usually points me in the direction of the error (my thinking). Eg. thinking my db was somewhere it wasnt then updating the wrong thing (copy to out directory fail)... thinking my update command/commandtext was right...thinking everything cached was updated/refreshed ...a few of my usual plays. Step it through? 
You should be using git-lfs for game development. Assets do not count towards the total size limit. Git LFS only has a 2 GiB limit per object.
As others have stated you’ll need windows. You can rub Windows for free (minus the cost of the operating system) with Parallels for Mac. Parallels Desktop Lite by Parallels International GmbH https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parallels-desktop-lite/id1085114709?mt=12 You may be able to get a free copy of Windows 10 (Education) through your school. Check with your IT help desk for help. They may also help you install the OS as well.
Thanks for the suggestion, I just tried but nothing changed. just to let you know i'm not getting any errors, and by using breakpoints the whole thing runs just fine, just for some reason the update doesn't work
Yeah, I'll say. Must be one of the "deplorables" out there. They're banned.
Yep, its my teacher he wants to use it, unfortunately no one in my class has a choice in the matter, he says that its what they do in industry, but he hasn't worked in the industry in a good while. Just to give you some context this is my course work for my A-Level
Could you use a message queue between your cache layer and SignalR Hub?
Removed: Rule 4. There are plenty of resources out there for working with databases. The method you use will likely depend on the nature and framework of the app you're using. Try jumping in by web searching for it or you can look at some of the help resources at /r/learnprogramming.
Ok thanks 
Getting Windows from the Microsoft page for free is also an option, but customisation of the desktop will be unavailable and of course... THE WATERMARK. But that depends if the person is willing to not pay for it.
Try to wrap your query in a try catch just for testing so you can get what exception is being thrown. Let me know if the exception is hit and what the result is. 
Big thanks for the suggestion and knowledge, I'll look into how to do your suggestions and get it done and keep posting. Also thanks for the insight into the SQL injection attack it won't matter for the thing i'm making, but ill change it, always great to get into a good habit :)
Absolutely, hopefully it’ll help. I run a team of ten so I field questions like this most days. Hope you get it sorted
I’ll let the Blazor people know that they’re wrong.
Another thought: find out where the SQL Server logs are and look at them. If a database error is happening, it should appear in the log. I'm sorry I can't give more detail on how to find the logs, but I use PostgreSQL.
Bootcamp or computer lab. When I was in college I just used MSDNAA and got a Windows 8 key. I'm guess you're just starting out and you will be in over your head with any alternative solutions.
Could you make a restful api to consume your dll and have your website query this api, or a console app writing to an xml/json file your api or website can query might be a workaround. Extra steps but you can change your data source later with an api.
If you are performing a series of operations on a database, you can wrap them in a transaction. If the entire series is successful, you finish by committing the transaction. If any step fails, you can roll back the transaction to revert the database to the state it was in before you started, ensuring that the database remains consistent. Let's say Mr. Deadbeat writes a check to Mr. Creditor. Your program begins a transaction, adds money to Mr. Creditor's account, and then finds that Mr. Deadbeat had no money in his checking account. You roll back the transaction, and Mr. Creditor's account goes back to where it was before you added money to it, and then you write a nasty letter to Mr. Deadbeat. Much more detail, and the exact syntax to use in C#, can be found in a Google search.
I don't think you need to call open and close (close will be done for you by the `using`). What happens if you remove those?
&gt; Desktop app development Core is limited to .Net Core 3.0 on VS2019 Even then it's just Winforms/WPF on Core right? It's not cross-platform, still Windows only. &amp;#x200B;
Qt doesn't have official C# bindings
Beware that Xamarin.Mac is in preview, and it shows. The docs don't mention this. I have stability issues with my Xamarin.Mac app.
That sounds like it may work... &amp;#x200B; However, the pattern feels odd. What are you trying to accomplish? Aka? If you update the values back to what they were before the database change... you are essentially circumventing concurrency checks. If that is the case, why have a concurrency check to begin with? You can turn that off and not even have this issue to begin with (although, then you may overwrite newer values in your database). I guess I don't know what you are trying to achieve.
If you don't use Windows, you're in for a bad time. You'll be doing shit that's totally different than what your prof is teaching. Your only non-Windows options are: * AvaloniaUI * Xamarin * Mono * Web app ...All of which are very different from your good ol' Winforms or WPF which are both Windows only. The closest you'll get is Mono, which attempts to mimic Winforms but is still a totally different beast. You wouldn't even be using Visual Studio if you went that route. &amp;#x200B; Just find access to Windows somehow, whether that's on your machine or in a lab.
`entry.OriginalValues.SetValues(entry.GetDatabaseValues());` This line doesn't make sense, does it? I set my original values to my current database values, but how could I know if my current database values were infact my original values? Can anyone confirm whether im right or wrong that this makes little sense?
&gt; GUI builder tool Which? If you're going to be learning something you need to know which actual framework you're using.
You can actually connect to .xlsx files using ODBC connections and query it like a database. Each sheet is a table, I believe.
&gt;If you update the values back to what they were before the database change... you are essentially circumventing concurrency checks. Well, that might be true, but if the `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is thrown, I have to put in some code to handle it. And then just keeping the original values is one way to handle the exception, if you can follow me &gt;What are you trying to accomplish? Its for an application I am working on, where there has to be concurrency handling in place. Right now im in the stage of trying to find out how it is even possible to handle `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`, hence all the questions. Ultimately, I want to overwrite the database values with the current (proposed) values, and thereby save the current values to the DB.
YES, /u/sgcdialler, use a policy they are great
Run windows on a vm
Does the parent id that you're passing in exist as a record in the database? If they don't, the data won't be updated. Also, check your connection string is pointing to the same db you are checking.
If you have access to SSMS run the profiler and see what the exact SQL statement is you're executing. Then copy and paste it into SSMS. You'll see if 0 rows are being updated, or maybe the command itself isn't being executed etc.
Just replace uint with ulong
It's just a bunch of math, make the original variables longer numbers
You can easily dual-boot (Bootcamp) or virtualize (Parallels, VMWare, etc) and will run fine.
I'm not saying they are wrong. Their website says you can do full stack .NET development using "stable and consistent tools, languages, and APIs both in the browser and on the server". It doesn't say that 'Blazor' encompasses all of those concepts. They are talking about .NET standard / core, Mono WASM, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core, SignalR, Visual Studio, C#, the BCL, the dotnet sdk, Blazor, and a wealth of other concepts and technologies.
That is correct
You can build cross platform UI in Visual Studio for Mac with a GTK# project. 
I’ve had quite a bit of success with Xamarin.Mac, and haven’t run in to many issues. What sort of stability problems have you experienced?
That is not true. For a prng to spit out truly random numbers the values for all the operations and their initial values have been carefully chosen. If you just change around some shifts and make it a ulong you won't get a prng that magically generates 64bit random numbers. &amp;#x200B; For the OP: The random number generator code you show looks like it's a xorshift prng. There are many variants. This wikipedia page lists a few of them and there are also 64 bit prngs, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift)
Xamarin forms now also supports mac desktop
You’ve received quite a few answers at this point which encompass most of your options, but the truth is that we (and possibly you) need more information before we can help. There are two major UI frameworks with editors built into VS 2017—WinForms and XAML (used for WPF and UWP applications)—*for Windows*. First, you need to find out if using one frameworks is required for the class, in which case you’ll *have to* install Windows via Boot Camp or in an emulator. If they are not required, then your best bet would Xamarin.Mac, which will allow you to write C#/.NET applications, and connect them to Xcode to build a native UI with Interface Builder. Let us know what you find out, and we can provide more direction.
I get SIGSEGV errors. The best guess I can make is that Mono or Xamarin.Mac has disposed something on the .NET side, and the "native" side is trying to access the null object.
&gt; Ultimately, I want to overwrite the database values with the current (proposed) values, and thereby save the current values to the DB. That's... not how concurrency protection works. The best way to handle concurrency is to use the DB to do a transaction with an UPDATE statement. Rather than "Amount = 5", you do "UPDATE foo SET foo.Amount = foo.Amount + 5". A proper SQL database can guarantee concurrency protection in such a case. Now, we can't always do everything like that with complex business types, but you can use the same concept. Don't think in terms of "set the amount to 5", think of it in terms of what the *transaction* would be. The DatabaseValues vs. CurrentValues are there so you can compare them and properly implement your own mutation of the data.
That makes sense. I haven’t run into that problem, but it sounds very plausible, and having to deal with memory management manually in any situation in which it isn’t explicitly performance related would be pretty irritating.
Excellent, thanks for the thoughtful replies!
Thank! I saw you removed my post rules 4. Im looking for the rules atm and i cant find them. Im probably blind sorry
For what need? I think outlook is okay priced.
Yeah, it's an app-breaking issue for me. I opened an issue with Xamarin.Forms, and one of the guys there said I should open it with Xamarin.Mac, so I need to get around to that soon and let them fix it.
Bootcamp, Parallels, Virtual Box (which I don’t suggest, definitely did a great job of overworking my machine!)...
\&gt; **JavaScript** is a good choice for your first programming language. Yup, this article is pretty worthless.

I understand the concern but with this setup SignalR Hubs act nearly as an API call that creates the connection through one of several different technologies like long polling, forever frames or websockets. Every part of the solution would operate on its own. You receive the data from the server in the form of JSON so you can do with that what you will. As for the dlls I assume in this situation they are only being passed in parameters for math operations, not in the form of models
Nice! This has everything I need! Thank you! 
I believe the default timeout for a lost connection is 15 seconds? This is handled on the client using the [HubConnection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/jj889727\(v%3Dvs.111\)) . In frameworks like Angular the HubConnection tracks its state 
No, the longest sheet has 47 columns.
I don’t get where you’re going with this. It has nothing to do with the question and it’s an embarrassing exercise in pedantry. You just listed a bunch of pieces that make up Blazor. If you don’t know what Blazor is, you should look at the website I linked to you *twice* instead of this crusade to prove that you’re right and I’m wrong.
Thank you, I will check it
Yeah, it should do the job better but the requested language was C#, thank you anyway
Thank you, I will check it
Yeah, unsurprisingly, if you're making changes to the code, you need to re-deploy when you change it. Normally, if you're using this sort of Auth attribute, you don't change it often (if ever) . You may just need to rethink your roles, and add/remove the users in those roles instead. If you have roles for ProductCreator, ProductEditor, ProductAdmin , CategoryAdmin, SiteAdmin (or whatever suits your site) some who can add, some can edit, some can delete.....then there should be little reason to change the roles allowed per-action. Roles aren't Users. Users can have multiple Roles. Alternatively, you will need to make your own Auth attribute that queries your DB instead. Apply an "access-roles" and/or "edit-roles" field to the page/item in the DB and make a custom attribute that queries the user's roles against the DB field instead of the hard-coded Action attribute. That way Bob can edit or delete productA but can only view ProductB
I've had a similar situation with an older project. I moved the list of roles into a config variable, and had a custom class derived from the AuthorizeAttribute. I had to restart the app pool with each web.config change, but it was easier than a re-deploy.
A using statement does not automatically open the connection, it just creates the object for you. You still need to call connection.Open inside a using statement if you want to use the connection with your database. 
ExecuteNonQuery returns an integer with the number of rows affected. Capturing that value might help you debug a little.
You were attributing things to Blazor that aren't technically part of Blazor. That kind of thing would get you laughed at by some devs. I'm not on a crusade, and I don't need to read the website...I was scouring the Blazor gitter before that website existed.I just thought you were incorrect in thinking about how Blazor fits in the .NET ecosystem, and you were very rude in turn. \[I give up\]([https://media.giphy.com/media/Ennb4fZczzAS4/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ennb4fZczzAS4/giphy.gif)).
Can't seem to get it working on 32 bit process, so in "Properties - Build" you have to uncheck "Prefer 32-bit" It's a little bit of code but it should be to just copy-paste this in your Program.cs file, fix the excel file path and run: [https://pastebin.com/LNbgKMct](https://pastebin.com/LNbgKMct)
&gt; Desktop app development Core is limited to .Net Core 3.0 on VS2019 ...and Windows. OP asked about macOS. 
Can you do me a favor and spit out that update string and paste it in here? As others have mentioned, you should parametize everything, just get into the habit. I'm assuming this is for school too? Otherwise I'd recommend using entity framework or other ORM service
Looks nice, looking forward for more, thanks!
Be wary; confusing (classic) Unity with ECS is a pretty common mistake. Unity is currently adding ECS as a bolt-on module, which means Google results on the topic can get confusing, but know that the standard Unity object model (using `GameObject` and `MonoBehaviour`) is definitely _not_ ECS but rather a simpler form of component-based design. I highly recommend you use component-based design no matter what you do and never again subject yourself in inheritance hierarchies for object composition, but don't call it ECS unless it's _actually_ ECS. That'll just confuse people further. :)
Good point!
Virtual box + windows
Could do with less emojis in the README.md, but what the fuck do I know, I'm just an old fart
Using does not open the connection
This code is (mostly) industry standard, but you have minor issues 1) open connection before creating command object (this will require curly brackets for connection) 2) you don’t have to explicitly call connection.close() - thats what the using statement is for
Thank you for reminding me to get off Reddit, and start doing my homework.
You cannot cast without a type at compile time. What you would want to do is use reflection to call the Put function with MethodInfo.Invoke.
I am just curious why the object is generic in the first place. You can't call any methods on this object. Wouldn't it be better to have all of your methods have generic parameters? This way you can have the correct type at all times. Once you enter the realm of reflection, you are forced to use reflection from then on out.
This is almost certainly the cause. Check you know what ParentID’s value is, and that a record exists with that ID The execute returns an int (number of records updated) - check that and perhaps fail if it’s zero 
&gt;Of course, you have to set up permissions for all Roles then, and this hits your database an additional time per request. Tradeoffs. You should definitely be caching this sort of thing. 
/u/LookAtThisRhino and /u/cryo are right. WinForms/WPF coming for Core 3.0 won't help you on Mac. If you're ready for a steep learning curve, you can try out AvaloniaUI (https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia). It's cross-platform but XAML is incredibly difficult to work with, so I suspect AvaloniaUI will be similarly so. Sorry for the confusion. 
I didn't realize Xamarin for desktop apps too? Not just mobile? For windows desktop, any reason to use Xamarin over WPF?
Absolutely!
