Didn't realize react native was out there, good suggestion for the OP.
That fixed it. Works perfectly now.
I used to do work for a company that relied heavily on Crystal Reports and PowerBuilder. By far the worst contract I've been on. I'm not sure which of those I'd consider worse...
linux
Yes, it is a thing that exists.
Try replacing it with another Console.ReadLine()
It's mostly that there's less of a learning curve with WinForms. The GUI designer is a lot closer to the VB6 one as well.
&gt; By trouble I mean sometimes when I would open my solution, it would error that it can't find the Focus UC anymore. Some playing around with rebuilds and closing and reopening would fix it but I don't know what is actually going on. That's a common problem with WinForms. The only real solution is to move away from WinForms to a more modern UI development framework like WPF. &gt; One method of making them is to create a new user control project You don't need to create a whole new project, just create a WinForms UserControl in the same project as your main form. Drag and drop the controls you need and wire up the code behind. Compile the solution and the UserControl will show up in the UI designer toolbox so you can drag and drop it into the main form. This allows you to compose the main UI from several small controls, each responsible for their own little island of functionality.
Do you have any specific question? 
Removed: Rule 4. You'll need to make an attempt and ask specific questions about issues you're having and include relevant code. Your best bet is likely a third party tool, likely commercial. As suggested, SpreadsheetGear is a good start; I have experience with it too (on the Silverlight side) and it was pretty easy to integrate and get running.
No worries, I didn't take it that way. You're absolutely right though, it's not a good practice to blindly copy and past code. When I practice, I tend to copy/paste it then read for errors. Often times what I'm seeing on a web-site isn't as easy to read as in VS.
From a memory point of view, you didn't actually change I. You created a new space in memory with 2 and assigned i to it. this program illustrates what I am trying to say: static void Main(string[] args) { var x = 1; var y = x; y = 3; //output is 1 Console.WriteLine(x); var objectX = new TestObject(); var objextY = objectX; objextY.x = 3; //output is 3 Console.WriteLine(objectX.x); var xx = 1; unsafe { int* yy = &amp;xx; *yy = 3; } //output is 3 Console.WriteLine(xx); Console.ReadLine(); } public class TestObject { public int x = 1; }
Go take a look at /r/rainmeter
This is probably too large of a project to try and learn programming. I would imagine you would have to do something like this in c++ since your trying to modify the windows operating system.
I would also say it's quite helpful to go through your code step by step on paper. It has helped me in the past catch exactly what was going wrong. As opposed to debugging in the ide, figuring out where something was wrong, but not always knowing why. 
Thank you for the replies but i only need a line of code to show a popup crystal report screen that show a preview of it. I posted the codes in the hastebin above. The empty line is at line 61 
[Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net) may be an interesting way to help you learn both C# and JavaScript. Here's a simple demo with jQuery AJAX calling back to server-side WebMethod endpoint, see http://deck.net/webservice. Hope this helps.
Thanks, I'll check it out. 
At a low enough level, key down and up can be detected (and emulated, I guess). Although the keyboard itself can handle the repeat, it might also be done at the OS level for more flexibility.
As long as you don't use more than 7 elements you won't see this magic, though :)
I learned from Venkat @ YT. He explains this in detail and so you will understand. Or search for Bob Tabor on YT or channel9 great teacher.
I don't see a question in your post. Unless it's the linguistic question. It's called execute/execution/to execute, or just to run.
Yeah; it's not too much effort and it only needs to be done once.
That seems reasonable, although I think that's far too aggressive; you don't need to save *that* often, I think.
You could use a save on every keystroke to a variable or local cache and then every 3 to 5 seconds save the variable/cache value to disk.
Why do you need that? It seems to me that you are making your task unnecessarily complicated.
I want to edit a file which is located on another server. This seemed to be the best way to perform the task.
I don't understand why you need that "run" process, and how it helps with editing files.
Names of system files are generally the same across languages, with the exception of certain "special folders" (documents, images, etc.). However, like the other commenter I don't understand what you're actually trying to accomplish here. `Process.Start` is made for running a command, so using it to run a command that runs commands is rather redundant. I don't think "run.exe" even exists.
The 'run' dialog isn't an executable that you can run yourself, it's part of the 'explorer' shell. There's nothing it can do that you can't do programmatically anyway.
I tried to check quickly in Process Hacker, and when I passed a path to the text file, it was opened in Notepad, which was a child process of Explorer. I didn't see any other process between them.
Thank you! I just implemented it this way, and it works as expected.
Thank god. You understood what I meant. Thank you very much! It works like a charm atm. Gotta test it a few times, but thank you!
&gt; From a memory point of view, you didn't actually change I. You created a new space in memory with 2 and assigned i to it. Huh? I'm pretty sure this is wrong. Your example code doesn't illustrate that. See this example: unsafe { int i = 1; // output is 1 Console.WriteLine(i); int* pi = &amp;i; // output is 1 Console.WriteLine(*pi); // output is 107383844 Console.WriteLine((int)pi); i = 2; // output is 2 Console.WriteLine(*pi); // output is still 107383844 Console.WriteLine((int)pi); }
PHP gets bashed (as it should) but ASP/ .NET web stuff seemed to get bashed even harder so i never gave it a chance. I feel like im going to find out "ohhhh this is why it sucks", but i have yet to find anything like that.
&gt; PHP gets bashed (as it should) but ASP/ .NET web stuff seemed to get bashed even harder If I had to wager a guess, it might be because PHP has already generally fallen out of favour. If you were looking around 10 years ago, you might see a lot more PHP bashing. Now it's mostly a joke/memory for a lot of developers and as such doesn't garner nearly as much discussion as more common-day modern languages/frameworks (Python, ASP.NET, Node, Ruby, etc.); it's so out-of-mind that it often doesn't even enter as a point of discussion, in the same way as people rarely bring up modern development with LISP or SmallTalk or C or Perl. Sure they're there, but they're mostly a non-factor for typical development now. ^\* ^EDIT: ^I ^bet ^I'm ^going ^to ^receive ^flak ^for ^mentioning ^those ^languages ^;) Also, I _personally_ don't see much hate for ASP.NET MVC. Maybe the old ASP.NET webforms, but generally I do see positive suggestions to go with MVC when it makes sense. There's always the general hate-on for Microsoft technologies, but otherwise MVC is generally considered _good_. At the very least, competitive with other mainstream web/server technologies out there for typical use-case scenarios. Good news is that you learned a good chunk of "JS/JQuery/Typescript/CSS/SCSS/HTML"; these are pretty transferable skills for anyone doing web-based work regardless of the server-side backend. It's also probably a good thing that now that you've familiarized yourself with PHP (both its benefits and flaws), you can really appreciate the transition web development has made in the past 15 years from relatively small-scale scripty _web sites_ to large-scale, maintainable enterprise-grade _web applications_.
Has anyone here tried to get it working on Linux or Mac for either deployment or development? I tried it on my Macbook but had to manually install OpenSSL to even get it started, then it failed several times when using the dotnet new command. Are these troubles unique to me?
.NET Core 2 specifically? Or .NET Core in general? I've worked with it on multiple Linux distros without issues so far.
It was .NET Core 1, can't remember the version number exactly, sorry. I'll try it out on my Linux machine at some point, but it was giving me a hell of a time on Mac OS.
I don't think an issue with your C# code or the binary insertion. The error indicates that the _column itself_ doesn't exist regardless of what you're doing with it. Double-check that you've added the column, there are no typos, you are referencing the correct database, and referencing the correct table. EDIT: Well, hmm, maybe? Your SQL query byte data also looks odd to me. I think if you fix the column name issue, you're still going to have an issue inserting the binary data. As it is: "','" + UtilityScanner.ms.ToArray() + "')" I think will just output literally as: `', 'System.Byte[]')` You might need to do something like this instead: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1955977/insert-binary-data-into-sql-from-c-sharp-without-a-stored-procedure
The easiest way to cause that exception is doing something like var list = new List&lt;string&gt; { "a", "b", "c" }; foreach (var item in list) list.Remove(item); so it's not *necessarily* async related. Keep in mind that LINQ to Objects uses deferred execution, so a single enumerator of the "source" list could be implicitly kept alive through dozens of nested LINQ operations, during none of which the underlying collection may be modified.
I tested .NET Core out on Mac with VS Code with some sample projects. The experience was ok but what I missed most was actually Visual Studio itself and the ease of churning out code with the aid of the debugger and intellisense. I prefer .NET Core on Windows but funny enough that kinda defeats the purpose of why Microsoft created Core in the first place. It'd be fantastic if Microsoft could clone Visual Studio and have that be available for Mac or Linux.
A better way to put it. Thing of each number as a constant. You can't change the meaning of 1. 1 is always 1. I can't change 1 to 2. Imagine if the int32 struct was in fact mutable instead. You would have this: public class MutableInt32 { private int m_value; public MutableInt32(int x) { m_value = x; } public static implicit operator MutableInt32(int x) { return new MutableInt32(x); } public static MutableInt32 operator +(MutableInt32 x, MutableInt32 y) { return new MutableInt32(x.m_value + y.m_value); } public void ChangeThings(int x) { m_value = x; } public override string ToString() { return m_value.ToString(); } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { MutableInt32 temp1 = 1; MutableInt32 temp2 = temp1; //as expected its 1 Console.WriteLine(temp1); temp2 = 5; //as expected its 1 Console.WriteLine(temp1); //reset temp2 = temp1; temp2.ChangeThings(3); //Wat? Console.WriteLine(temp1 + temp1); Console.ReadLine(); } } 
Useful response, thank you!! I guess i just had misconceptions about how people felt about it. I'm in the process of totally redoing my backend. I feel like i have so much more extensibility and room to grow and add features with ASP.NET / MVC. 
Yup: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/
&gt; Wait for the contents of the text box to change. This also works well for edge cases like pasting text via mouse, where keystroke detection would miss the changes.
What is the problem? You don't have a reference to the first form1 window in form2?
Yeah but it's perfect, always good to have a couple of extra eyes on things. I also downloaded a spell checker plugin for visual studio now and found a couple of other things to fix. But your declaration finding was most important as it actually affect the naming of the api methods. So I created a fast 0.2.1 release with our fixes so we get it out of the way before more users start to download the nuget package and notice it :-)
Awesome, I'll get the update in the morning and crack on :)
People joke about it; but it's true in that there are two kinds of languages or frameworks: 1. The ones that complain about constantly. 2. The ones that nobody complains about because they're dead and no longer used.
I've never gotten it working and I use debian based distro. Low effort attempt and never got further than installing the dependencies that they don't even list in the install guide and having it still not work.
As far as I know you can install some VSC plugins to make your life a lot easier and provide you with a similar experience to VS. I'm pretty sure you can at least get C# intellisense in there.
Yes, I thought as much, but I was mostly looking for recommendations of said books. But thank you for taking time out of your day to give me this advice.
May I have a link to that discord server? Thank you for these tips :)
There is no difference in the resulting code, it is solely a matter of convenience/readability of the source code.
Hmm how do you like angular 2? I've been curious to see if React +.net has a future
I'd love to teach you. Send me a PM if you want.
[Here is a pretty simple tutorial on creating a web API using ASP.NET.](https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api) It walks you through creating the API and then setting up a simple user interface.
I don't know what your problem is but the instructions work perfectly fine under Sierra, you just have to have homebrew installed
The two most important things for building software well is understanding **discrete mathematics**, literally math of how algorithms can exist/work and **data structures** for understanding how data is logically stored in computers and that there is purpose in *how* it's stored and ergo how it is accessed and queried. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/23407/are-there-any-good-discrete-mathematics-video-online https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms These courses from coursera look perfect for self taught learning. 
That's right. The change event has a lot of utility.

If you look to the right of this webpage, you should see a sidebar with a bunch of good links that people have recommended. That has some good articles and video tutorials. Personally, I would start with the C# Fundamentals video that is linked there.
Have you checked out Project Rider? https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/documentation/rider_survival_guide.html I think it is a good alternative. Not completely reliable yet at is still early access, but very promising.
I disagree, that's not at all why Microsoft created Core. It is an added benefit, but it's all about the headless servers; microservices running in containers scaling with powerful elasticity. Low overhead. Cutting out the crap
Look into getting the Head First C# book if you want a book to read. It is entertaining and does well on the basics. 
S/six/half dozen Windows is the crap that's holding us down. I wouldn't say modularization of say entity framework is cutting out the crap.
Not really S/six/half dozen. I agree regarding Windows, but the level of modularization you mention yourself, that .NET Core brings, allows our software to be faster &amp; less bloated, irregardless of OS. That's what I mean by "cutting out the crap" (even though Windows can be apart of that)
The XML you have pasted it self is not proper. No parser is going to be able to deserialise it.
Code Race is a simple C# program to make it easy to create races comparing two methods to see which one is faster. Code Race includes an Item Template that does most of the work for you, so all you have to do is write your two methods.
Better just use [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet), which does an excellent job at this and also checks for various gotchas (methods need to be Jitted first, warns if you run with Debugger attached or compiled in Debug mode, etc). Can't get any easier than this library and very smart people are behind this. People that know .NET in depth. Besides that: We already know you prefer CodePlex over good platforms. But why are you not properly hosting your source code there? All I can see is a download to a zip archive - not very trustworthy. But [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/de/file/39b69ccbf53edde1d41d02de0cb0aaef7b7d05cca3ded758f5639eed1086f6b3/analysis/1485246774/) does not complain. If I understand your description correctly, this is supposed to be a library to make performance tests, right? If so, why does the zip archive contain so much junk? Ignoring the **user specific files**, there are whole UI tools contained. There are obscure code obfuscating methods like `NullHelper.Exists`, and incredible much "Helper"-class code smell.
 var xmlDocument = XDocument.Load(dellApiUrl.Replace("&lt;SERVICE_TAG&gt;", serviceTag)); ~~As far as I can tell from the documentation `XDocument.Load(string)` loads from a file, not via the internet, so why are you passing it a URL ? (I'm assuming `dellApiUrl` is a string containing a URL but you haven't shown it's initialisation so I could be wrong).~~ EDIT: ignore this paragraph! If that line's giving you the error, I suggest breaking it down into 2 parts; one that gets the XML into a variable, and the next that loads the XML from that variable into an `XDocument`; then you can easily inspect the XML that you're trying to load to see what's up. 
I think that user [f42e479dfde22d8c](https://www.reddit.com/user/f42e479dfde22d8c) has said almost everything I would have done. But I would add a second timer to save once in a while, if the first timer hasn't fired for a certain period of time. This would help in case of crashes. An alternative is to use a local cache (ie. a file) in which you save from time to time, to protect from crashes. Also, if you use autosave I would eliminate the button "save" because it will probably confuse users.
Yeah I have homebrew installed, I have no idea what the problem is either.. it wasn't essential so I'm not going to waste the time on it. As a bit more detail brew will install openssl, but I can't link it - so the os still sees 0.9.8 installed. Tried to get around it with multiple methods, including forcing the linking and creating symlinks etc but nothing worked for me.
There is no difference in which way you *reference* the namespace. &gt; does the CLR compile the whole System namespace down into the final build vs the second example only compiling what it needs from that namespace? What the CLR will do is that it will *bind* (load) at runtime the Assembly that contains the ~~namespace~~ class that you need, the assembly might be in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) or in a separate file somewhere. When in Visual Studio you "add reference" to an Assembly what you are doing is basically writing somewhere in your application "I need this assembly to run, please find it and load it" (more or less) For a more formal explanation [read the documentation on MSDN about Assembly binding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yx7xezcf\(v=vs.110\).aspx) Edit: On a side note: the CLR does indeed compile, but at runtime, with a technique called Just in Time compilation. What you get after compiling in Visual Studio is an Assembly written in [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) (Common Intermediate Language), this is written by the C# compiler and not the CLR. The CLR is something that "executes" your Assembly by compiling it into actual machine code that your CPU will execute
What about PInvoke calls? Are they gonna get ported too?
I'd prefer to *be able to* develop on all the targeted platforms at least.
Don't dismiss any tool or language just because you feel like people "bash" it. Especially if you only get these opinions from online communities. Many people just parrot stuff they've heard or read about and I can assure you that many people who bash PHP or ASP.NET have not worked with either in years, if ever. If you tried ASP.NET/MVC and liked it that's all that really matters. Use what works for you.
Just using timer and make nonsynchronous methods to save is simple.
Visual Studio for Mac is currently in preview and is a good start towards this. 
I looked at your example and have written myself a little demo but unfortunately the CPU usage is very high, even when just displaying something static.
The simple solution is to just dispose of all the things. GC does a pretty good job at disposing stuff but you should make a habit of disposing everything you can anyway. I've gotten into debates before over the effectiveness or usefulness of disposing everything but honestly for maybe 15 characters of code its worth just getting into the habit. That way when you use something that doesn't get picked up by GC you are already in the habit of disposal.
Don't use if you don't like it. As with all my open source projects you get triple your money back if you don't like it.
Then I stand corrected, thanks. However, my point about separating the line into 2 separate parts still stands. 
You joke, but I'm considering now because of this (and other posts) of making a rule that linking to any source code or project must done transparently. That is, the code should be visible and browseable in the web UI and not require the download of any file (zip, exe, etc.) to view or run.
Try and remove the xmlns attribute.

I'm on my phone so I can't look it up easily right now, but isn't there an "end of file" you can use instead of end of stream?
no there isn't. I would have to change the class type of my readFile object, which then would get rid of my .Split method.
I have no clue what exactly your issue is. Your "code does not account for all lines" but it "accounts for each line and the while loops stops after the line/column ends"? Could you try and explain this a bit better? Or post an example of the text file and the output you get?
Another one which I have in my bookmarks: https://github.com/samoatesgames/mui.extended.toolkit Based on https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui/
The code looks ok actually, but on your asset entity I take it you have just one ID property? If there is 2 properties for example Public int ID {get;set;} Public int assetID {get;set;} Possibly one id is being confused with another ? Without seeing the table/entity contents I can't really diagnose properly. 
You could make a simple service or application that involves processing an extremely large file/dataset. That scenario allows you to practice async and also parallelism while applying a streaming approach
Any reason you need to use `StreamReader`? I would just use `File.ReadAllLines` and be done with it: List&lt;string[]&gt; commaDelimitedLines = File.ReadAllLines(files) .Select(l =&gt; l.Split(',')) .ToList(); EDIT: I also want to echo the other posters. Your requirements are confusing. Could you reword them, and maybe ideally provide an example of your input and what your resultant code/data/types should be?
how would I incorporate that with a while loop? while(!readFile.ReadToEnd() == '\0') would that work?
say I had: a b c a b c a b c a b c a b c a b c it stops after reading column 1, and disregards the other columns 
Your code reads line-by-line, not column-by-column. The other column values are in the rest of the `values` arrays?

You mean, you want it to display nicely indented for the user? Something like this? &lt;message&gt; &lt;id&gt;0&lt;/id&gt; &lt;displayname&gt;System&lt;/displayname&gt; &lt;content&gt;Welcome to chat!&lt;/content&gt; &lt;time&gt;2017-01-24 00:29:32.0931366&lt;/time&gt; &lt;contenttype&gt;text/plain&lt;/contenttype&gt; &lt;partytype&gt;3&lt;/partytype&gt; &lt;partykey /&gt; &lt;/message&gt; &lt;message&gt; &lt;id&gt;0&lt;/id&gt; &lt;displayname&gt;System&lt;/displayname&gt; &lt;content&gt;Bob Ross has left the conversation.&lt;/content&gt; &lt;time&gt;2017-01-24 00:29:42.6487233&lt;/time&gt; &lt;contenttype&gt;text/plain&lt;/contenttype&gt; &lt;partytype&gt;3&lt;/partytype&gt; &lt;partykey /&gt; &lt;/message&gt;
Please post your demo code here https://gist.github.com/ and I will try and if I see any issues in the code that would cause "very high" CPU usage, I can suggest a change. If I find it looks good, and its my lib causing it, I can run your demo and debug it to fix it which is good for every one :) thanks.
Yes, I believe that is the first step. I am having a brainfart day, but I cannot find a solution to do the following. A more plain text readable format would be preferred.

[LINQ to XML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt693062.aspx) is probably your best bet. Depending on your particular needs, you might also look into deserializing the XML into your own object. More info [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/182eeyhh.aspx).
+1 for MUI, very nice UI framework. Fills a perfect niche in making a "modern" styled app that's backwards compatible on older versions of Windows.
I know a guy named G. Oogle, he has pretty neat resources for seemingly everything. Like [this](http://zbrad.github.io/tools/wscore/) or [this](http://dotnetthoughts.net/using-websockets-in-aspnet-core/) or [this](http://www.softfluent.com/blog/dev/2016/12/11/Using-Web-Sockets-with-ASP-NET-Core)
I would suggest deserializing it or using LINQ-to-XML (or other XML parsing methods) as suggested by /u/adrach87. I think using the `XmlSerializer` is probably a decent way of doing it. Although, I'm not sure what methods will work or break since you have two duplicate root nodes `message`. I'm not sure if _technically_ it's valid XML as-is, though if it isn't, all you have to do is wrap it in a dummy root node.
I tried putting [Key] above the AssetID but it didn't work. As for making RegionID nullable, how come you're making RegionID nullable? Also sorry not too familiar with c# but I have heard of migration, is that updating the .edmx file from the database? I'm doing database first btw.
its making a new modal, but when it refernces them in the DOM it picks up the first one by ID. So, the structure seems alright but the deceleration of the modal needs have a new id in the loop, like "DeleteModal_[assetID]". 
Ah, ive not done anything with .edmx files, i usually do it code first and work from there. The region id you have in your asset class public Nullable&lt;int&gt; RegionID { get; set; } Is already nullable by doing : public int? RegionID { get; set; } (Replacing Nullable&lt;T&gt; with ?) is just sort hand, something you might find useful. The only reason i can think of is why that id is nullable in the first place is beacuse there is no constraint set up in the database, and when the database classes where generated, VS wasn't sure and made it nullable. Also after looking at /u/kingofsomecosmos's answer, they are indeed on the right track here, i was too stupid to realise it . I've had it before when clicking a submit button on one form will actually submit another form with the same name, One way you deal with this is to use a plain old button with an onclick event to submit a specific form.(this is a little messy by the way, personally i dont like this approach but its the first thing that comes to mind) @Html.Button("Save", "glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-saved", new { @class = "btn btn-xs btn-success nav-button", @type = "button", @onClick = "$('#@item.AssetID').submit();" }) 
I wrapped them in a node of "messages" now. &lt;messages&gt; &lt;/messages&gt; Time to convert them to html!
ahhh gotcha I see what you're saying now. The Nullable&lt;int&gt; is all auto-generated when making the classes. I'm trying to use my own symbol but I'll try and do it your way while trying to implement my symbol.
SignalR.
You want to HTML to resolve to something like below: &lt;span class="lnr lnr-trash" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#DeleteModal_1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="modal fade" id="DeleteModal_1" role="dialog"&gt; where the _1 is the unique part of the modal id and target. the call with "data-target="#DeleteModal"" is targeting the item with DeleteModal as the ID. since you had multiple (one for each loop) it picked the first one. You need to make each id unique.
ooo yes I see what you're saying and that makes a lot of sense. but then now is the part of how to make it unique? i was thinking to make a variable called count and increment it by one, but is it possible to append that to both the data-target and id? something like "#DeleteModal_[insert count variable here]"? and then count would start with 1 and go up?
Unity is a game framework, Visual Studio is an IDE, these are two different tools. It's kind of like asking "should I use a hammer or a saw when building a deck"... the answer is: both. In regards to being a beginner, if you are totally new to programming, you're going to find this course too advanced. If you mean beginner to game coding, sure why not, it's just $15.
Woah. SignalR does look exactly like what I need, thanks!
if your asset id is unique, I would just append that value. there is no need to create a new variable. 
great!
I normally do but don't know why I missed that. Not sure if I should leave the thread up for future people, or delete everything now before people feel like giving me more downvotes
Can I ask why? I've been looking at their scheduler, and it seems like the most full featured one out there. Was thinking about giving the whole DevExpress package a try.
Haha, just leave it up. It's just that in this line of work your google-fu is as important as your programming skills.
Can you elaborate? I wrote applications using it before and I didn't experience any :(
nHibernate? I won't get into the ORM wars here, but at least pick one that supports Async/Await. 
This one is amazing. Both MahApps and MaterialDesign are excellent choices. I've used both and they're pretty easy to work with.
I'm biased so I would recommend the one I wrote, Tortuga Chain. But really, for basic UI-driven applications any will work so long as they support async/await. Otherwise you have to spend all of your time messing around with background threads to avoid blocking the UI.
Again thanks for the detailed answer, I'm surly going to check your mvvm framework. The main reason I'm into mvvm-light is the pluralsight videos the author made about it which were great in my opinion.
Take a look at the free Visual Studio Dev Essentials program: https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/ One of the fantastic benefits is you get 3 months of Pluralsight for free. Pluralsight is hands down the best online resource for C# &amp; .NET courses. Sign up for Dev Essentials program and take Pluralsight courses to your heart's content. You won't regret it. 
&gt;Trying to parse data from XML, get an error The story of my life...
Although you fixed your problem, i beg you please use parameterized queries. 
Say your top level A has children B and C. C has child D which has child E. Something changes on E which you want to trigger a function in B.
Oh fuck. So he fixed the memory leak by breaking it in the other direction. I swear, the only reason that library is popular is the name. 
Yeah, the API looks nice, but once you scratch the surface it has a bunch of issues.
Per the edit: **Edit**: I had to edit out certain information because its private, assume &lt;service_tag&gt; is the service tag of a system and &lt;apikey&gt; well you get the jist. I don't want to freely post an apikey for everyone to see and run up the daily calls against the domain. The xmlns="#" is private for a reason, another piece of information that can't be posted. **Edit**: The XML data I posted was only a portion of what is actually being offered by the server. There is more to it but felt that the first few lines would be relevant. Just assume all closing tags are there. The XML data is served by a Dell server and would be out of my control. But can safely assume all necessary data is provided in the XML.
This is a pretty good enhancement. Previously, when you had a pinned object (because it was being used in an asynchronous I/O operation like a socket call) you could artificially run out of memory. This is because during the duration of the I/O operation you can't relocate a pinned object, because the network driver was depending on the memory address to remain the same the whole time. So pinned objects presented an artificial floor to the Gen0 allocator and over time that floor would get higher and higher until [Surprise!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB2GboGOuTI) No more memory.¹ This enhancement allows the allocator to use freed memory below the pinned objects. ¹ The answer, if you knew about this problem, was to allocate a pool of objects for I/O operations at the start of your program, so they'd be clustered together in memory 
Thankfully the vast majority of communication is just PropertyChanged. 
And we need moderators, why? Your importance is only in your own mind.
Throw away the shitty interopt code. Use nuget, get spreadsheet light. Thank me later. Edit:: http://spreadsheetlight.com
Does Spreadsheet Light offer advantages over EPPlus? edit: looks like it hasn't been updated in over 3 years..
You should be using loops instead of using goto. Your issue is that when you converted the answer from a string from Console.ReadLine(); to an integer. And trying to check if that int is equal too "I don't know", you should store the answer from Console.ReadLine(); to keep for later if you need it. Also using a while loop is a much better alternative to using goto, they are a nightmare to debug and are just bad programming habits that you should never start! public static void Main(string[] args) { //Create random number generator Random random = new Random(); //get two random numbers to do math int num1 = random.Next(1, 16); //gets number between 1 and 15 int num2 = random.Next(1, 16); Console.WriteLine("Enter q to quit at any time!"); while(true) { Console.WriteLine($"What is {num1} * {num2}?"); string answer = Console.ReadLine(); if(answer == "q") { Console.WriteLine("Goodbye!"); break; } //we try to parse the string that the user entered to see if it is what we want int number; if(int.TryParse(answer, out number)) { if(number == num1 * num2) { Console.WriteLine("Well done! Your answer is correct!"); //generate new random numbers after the user gets the answer correct! num1 = random.Next(1, 16); num2 = random.Next(1, 16); } else { Console.WriteLine("Wrong! Try again!"); } } else if(answer == "I don't know") { Console.WriteLine("Ok, here's another question!"); //generate new numbers if the user can not get the answer num1 = random.Next(1, 16); num2 = random.Next(1, 16); } else { Console.WriteLine("Try again!"); } }
It doesn't say whether the project needs to build with a 4.6.2 target or whether just running on that version is enough.
I would recommend using an Excel library like others have suggested, but if you are doing this for a non-OS project, make sure to check the licensing on the library first. Some are not fit for commercial use. Also, as an aside, you can declare a `using` statement like this: using excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel; Saves a lot of typing.
If it applies .Net FX you can bet it applies to .Net Core. These days, improvements are made to CoreClr and then filter down to NetFx, generally.
Please forgive me im really new to programming and still dont know how to use VS much.
As far as I know, it's not recognizing the VB code probably because you're pasting it in a .cs (for c#) file. So it's expecting c# syntax. Off topic, where did you get that minimap view? I've been looking for one.
Actually, I think closedXML is better.
You are in a C# project. In a C# project you can just have C# code. You can try create a VB library, have the code there, then call into that library from your main program.
Not sure why you're shirking WS so much, but the fact is ootb it's websockets first, even with server to server comms. [IE doesn't even support SSE](http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource)
It's built into VS, no need for a plug in. Just right click the scrollbar and you'll find options to turn it on.
I asked for scenarios, where many of redditors have used the same.
I'm shirking because WS are overrated (probably because kids see the node socket.io tic tac toe demos and think it's a reasonable way to write software). What you need is a push channel from the server, and do writes through normal XHR. In practice, clients are not directly connected to the application server, as the server sending the requests can change mid-session.
beautiful, thanks for your input. eni
Will do tomorrow. :) With high cpu usage I meant that 1 core was at full load and I was only displaying a static "0". In retrospect, I think it could have been caused because I did run it on a Virtual Machine. But as I said, I will notifiy you tomorrow again.
Thanks for great suggestions everyone! I will read through your responses then decide what to do next :)
I would assume that it does; 4.6.x isn't that new anymore.
It's especially useful in combination with dependency injection.
Instead of streamreaders and checking EndOfStream, if the file isn't absurdly large, just use `File.ReadAllLines(file)`.
.NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 already support .NET Standard 1.6. .NET Core 1.2 will support .NET Standard 2.0, yes.
I could seriously listen to this all day. Microsoft's developer talks on their internal systems are always super interesting, but the GC stands out as one of the more mysterious things that can impact app perf significantly. And she explains it really well! 
Not sure, I'll go have a look at epplus today. I have used spreadsheet light for a few years without complaints.
It seems to me that your code reads everything in the file, but stores only part of the data. If you could show us the rest of the loop, we might be able to help you more efficiently. To be more precise, your code reads text by lines, not columns. It gets the line "a b c", stores 'a' into myList1, then maybe does something else you haven't showed us, and after that repeats the process if there is still another line present. EDIT: just to clarify, you want to read the rows, and store every word into its own list? For example read "a b c defg", store 'a' into list1, 'b' into list2, 'c' into list3, "defg" into list4 ?
Set a breakpoint on the line and inspect `myList` and its contents. Should be fairly obvious what the problem is.
how do I do that? I'm a beginner at C#
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k0k771bt.aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ea46xwzd.aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.indexoutofrangeexception.aspx
set a breakpoint, and looked at myList; not really sure that I see what the problem is
 List&lt;List&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt; myList = new List&lt;List&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt;(); // ... int groupIndex = 0; // ... myList.Add(new List&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;()); // ... myList[0][groupIndex].Add(headers[i]); You add an item to `myList`, but at no point is anything added to `myList[0]`, so `myList[0][0]` is out of range.
You are iterating i from [0,headers.Length - 1]. When i == headers.Length -1 your if statement contains the expression headers[i + 1] which will cause an index out of bounds exception.
Wow, alright. So I need to add myList[0].Add(List&lt;string&gt;()); I think I am just confused on how lists work. Thank you. So if I do myList.Add(new List&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;()); which list does that add to? The 1st list or the second?
I changed it to headers[i-1] &amp;&amp; headers[i] starting from 1, seemed to work but it cut off my first value
How can I get all my values? I've tried a bunch of different things it's just not picking up either the last or first index depending on the type of for loop I write
Of course client initiates the request. This is with all the related solutions, starting with long polling. Check back in a year on how well websockets is doing against competition (http2).

A few questions/notes: * Can we see the `PlcSymbolDesc` and `SymbolDesc` definitions? There may be a discrepancy. Also I assume `PlcSymbolDesc` is a struct... * Your integer types do not line up. If you're working on nothing but Windows you'll get away with your definitions as-is (although you're also mixing signed/unsigned in places) but on 64-bit UNIX this is an error. I recommend using the stricter types defined in [cstdint](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdint). ---- However that being said your problem may likely be down to the fact that the marshaller can not obtain the size of the resultant array (that gets generated in C++). Also this kind of design prone to memory leaks (have you thought about when and where the memory in `*ppSymbolList` gets freed?). But with this design at least it would be better to use an `out IntPtr` and manually copy the data to a new array of correctly set size, something like this: SymbolList = new PlcSymbolDesc[NumOfSymbols]; GCHandle pinnedArrayHandle = GCHandle.Alloc(SymbolList, GCHandleType.Pinned); try { MemCopy( source, pinnedArrayHandle.AddrOfPinnedObject() destination.Length * sizeof(PlcSymbolDesc) ); } finally { pinnedArrayHandle.Free(); } // elsewhere... public static void MemCopy(IntPtr source, IntPtr destination, uint numBytes) { Memcpy(destination, source, new UIntPtr(numBytes)); } DllImport("msvcrt.dll", EntryPoint = "memcpy", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, SetLastError = false)] private static extern IntPtr Memcpy(IntPtr destination, IntPtr source, UIntPtr count); ---- If you're interested I also have some P/Invoke stuff that may come in handy on my blog: [P/Invoke Tips](http://benbowen.blog/post/pinvoke_tips/).
I would recommend a bit of light reading on how to structure your data better. A list of lists of lists is probably not the best thing to use for your case and you'll end up with a ton of other problems later in your code. If you have a better data structure, where you can discriminate the strings based on attributes, then you'll have an easier time writing all your code. Also look into linq. Have a good time learning c#.
I found the official online practice tests the most beneficial when preparing. The official exam ref was nice as well but the practice tests are really great.
StructureMap and Autofac are both fine. I would steer away from Unity since Microsoft has seemed to abandon it.
I was told to use a list of lists of lists, I don't have too much of an option I guess
Your wish is my command! https://www.nuget.org/packages/SamOatesGames.ModernUI.Xceed.Toolkit/ Hope I did it correctly, I've never published a NuGet package before. Any issues let me know :)
&gt; whilst you rarely create them directly, I'm glad he said this. I've almost never had to create a Func/Delegate ever, and I'm still not really sure of every day uses of them. It's quiet a relief that they arent that common as I was starting to think I was missing out on some key knowledge. I've recently started a job where they use some weird Funcs in combination with interfaces AutoFac for dependency injection. Not a clue how it works... I just do DI with the traditional interfaces and constructors idea like you're supposed to. /shrug
Not yet, but feel free to open an issue :).
The .NET Framework and .NET Core share code so these changes would also apply to Core.
I would also expect that, but would love for it to be explicitly called out either way 
Thanks for the input!
The value in currentMinimum will change each time the loop gets to a number smaller than what it was holding before. That's why you start with the biggest possible value (Int32.MaxValue).
I forgot that people would still use xml configuration. We used autofac at my last job because it auto-discovers so much stuff :S Seeman has a bunch of article about DI http://blog.ploeh.dk/tags/#Dependency Injection-ref I like automocking, but I use strict mocks. http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/03/11/auto-mocking-container/ 
Yeah it's crazy isnt it. This was 2015/2016 when I came across XML being used like that at my previous job. I came up with a simple XML format to describe some data. Wasn't in any way related to DI at that point, but no, the stupid "senior developer" who claimed to **HATE** XML decided that we would scrap my nice idea and instead fudge it into Unity XML config format. Well done, you coupled the data format directly to the container, making it even more complicated to remove that coupling in the future! At that point, why use a container, if you're just going to couple your design to the container implementation anyway which ironically is what DI is supposed to help you avoid! Absolutely infuriating, but the guy was all about creating job security for himself, right up until when I left. &gt; Seeman has a bunch of article about DI &gt; http://blog.ploeh.dk/tags/#Dependency Injection-ref &gt; I like automocking, but I use strict mocks. &gt; http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/03/11/auto-mocking-container/ Yeah I regularly read his articles, they are very interesting and the guy is really smart. Funny you should mention auto mocking, literally yesterday I was thinking about something like that. Am I right in thinking you'd use it to avoid having to create a lot of repetitive lines in your tests that look like this: var someThing = MockingFramework.Mock&lt;ISomeThing&gt;(); var someService = MockingFramework.Mock&lt;IService&gt;(); var someThingElse = MockingFramework.Mock&lt;ISomeThingElse&gt;(); I was looking at using AutoFixture also be Seeman for this, what do you think? I dont know much about auto mocking yet, just normal mocking.
I know this targets core but how does GC distribute with hybrid apps to different platforms. (i.e xamarin iOS and Android Projects)
Sadly, I don't have access to the automock code I wrote, but it came about as a was a way to deal with large numbers of dependencies in the constructor even though most methods used on a few :S I used an automocker for Moq, maybe this one, but I'm not sure: https://github.com/tkellogg/Moq.AutoMocker I was able to specify that all the automatic mocks were strict. var factory = new MockFactory(MockBehavior.Strict); var container = new AutoMockerContainer(factory ); //This would give a Car, but since we didn't declare any actual mocks, everything we call will throw. var car = container.Resolve&lt;Car&gt;(); If I wanted to mock the Engine I would add something like this before resolving the Car instance. container.RegisterMock&lt;IEngine&gt;([moq-setup-expectations]) The expected calls give back whatever was in the setup, and any unexpected calls throw. Also: Most of the code was in a base test class to keep the test methods simple 
Not all code is shared. Do you have a source saying that the GC is?
We use funcs in our generic framework if someone wants to override our built in json serializer with their own implementation. Func &lt;TOut, string&gt; We also have a func in some code for the developer to pass in their password decryptor so it can be decrypted at the point of use. Func &lt;string, SecureString&gt; I also use them a lot for events instead of using event handler. I can post more real word examples of using funcs.
Stackoverflow who else?? 😉
Take a look at the open source projects on GitHub. If you see one that is active offer to help out. 
Thanks @ProgrammerShrinks :3
Removed: Rule 4. There are some other subreddits that might be more appropriate for looking for such help/mentorship: /r/learnprogramming, /r/learncsharp, and /r/programmingbuddies. EDIT: And your post history doesn't seem to back up your claim of "professionalism and seriousness of any 30 year old". I would recommend that work on that if you're seeking mentorship.
&gt; whilst you rarely create them directly, While they may not be used as much recently with lambdas and async added to the language, we used to use them a lot. We still do for some delayed binding and inheritance (especially with WinForms along with events). I started Asp.Net while the original was still in beta. It took a while to understand delegates, but I learned how they worked, they were awesome.
Like /u/vivainio suggested, you can use a CI. I like gitlab.com because you can basically bring your own docker image. It is very nice. 
Removed: Rule 3. Might get more help at /r/PowerShell/ instead.
Sounds very nice. I've got to try out containers yet.
Hi and thank you for your reply! &gt;Can we see the PlcSymbolDesc and SymbolDesc definitions? C# [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] public struct PlcSymbolDesc { public string pszName; public UInt32 ulTypeId; public string pszType; public UInt16 usRefId; public UInt32 ulOffset; public UInt32 ulSize; [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = 2)] public char[] szAccess; public byte bySwapSize; } C++ struct PLCH_DLL_DECL PlcSymbolDesc { PlcSymbolDesc(void); ~PlcSymbolDesc(void); char* pszName; unsigned long ulTypeId; char* pszType; unsigned short usRefId; unsigned long ulOffset; unsigned long ulSize; char szAccess[2]; unsigned char bySwapSize; }; As I've said, I've tried passing this as a simple pointer back and forth and this works perfectly. I had a problem in which I had set Packed=1 in C# initially though. &gt;If you're working on nothing but Windows you'll get away with your definitions The library I'm trying to access isn't available on anything but Windows. But thanks for the tip! I'm going to take a look at your suggestion now. I'd rather maintain the interface but if this is easier, I'll do it that way.
Indeed, I was thinking more of some private repos that is not defenitely microsoft created. I'll check it out. Thanks Phrohdoh.
&gt; However from experience I know many places love to use ans abuse containers across their code base Some places also just love to use them. You can't always use poor-mans-DI, since it can't really handle extensions loaded from other assemblies.
At least with dependency injection (DI). I guess IoC can mean a bunch of other things.
Or people with other opinions ;)... but yeah, most developers are definitely lazy as well.
Dependency Injection: A fancy name for *passing the class some shit it needs.*
How do you XML document the arguments and return value of the delegate? If you have an actual delegate you can properly document it completely using the regular XML documentation syntax. But when you use `Func&lt;&gt;` or `Action&lt;&gt;` you can just document the delegate argument itself - but not the arguments of the delegate.
Did you end up hiring them?
Not sure if it's the best pattern but it's fairly popular to use MVVM for UWP. 
Yep, like I said. The delegate itself is not *properly* documented. Only the argument `jsonSerializer`. You're not applying XML documentation to the delegate itself (because you can't with Func). Whether you consider it worthwhile to properly document the delegate or consider this case simple enough for it to not be needed is another discussion.
I think you are arguing semantics here. The same documentation in the delegate is the exact same text in the method documentation. /// &lt;summary&gt; /// A custom JSON serializer to serialize the specified input data. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;typeparam name="T"&gt;The type of data to be serialized.&lt;/typeparam&gt; /// &lt;param name="data"&gt;The data to be serialized.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;returns&gt;A serialized JSON string of the input data.&lt;/returns&gt; public delegate string JsonSerializer&lt;T&gt;(T data); 
Thank you for doing this. I found it very helpful getting up to speed with network in .NET. I only followed a few parts directly related to TCP, but nonetheless, it was very useful. A request - it would be very helpful if you could compile this into a .epub book for e-readers.
I'll take that one to heart. lol I now how to do it all conceptually, but sometimes I can't remember methods or docs for them. 
nothing bro, i dont know the code. im new to c#...
So you don't use it? 
Thanks for clarifying that. VERY new to all of this so I appreciate being able to freely ask dumb questions. :)
In addition I suggest you to browse the properties, events and methods of each control on the MSDN website (it's on the right panel of the subreddit) to understand them better.
Yes. But of the ones I listed above are any of them particularly easier or harder?
Thanks for the dedication!
Oh, thank you for the gold!
I am mostly trying not to use any library and learn it myself, which is proved to be a tough choice. I did it with `SocketEventArgs` and `Async` Sockets (the one topic you didn't cover) :D I checked the tutorials more, I have to say it is pretty good. I have to spend some time this weekend going through it all, to read and fill the gaps in my knowledge.
Well, for someone learning it from scratch with all the examples being the same pingback with separate `Server` `Client` I had lots of trouble. p.s. Just ran code metrics on my code, the `CommunicationManager` alone is 360+ lines of code handling all the `Async` calls, `Buffers`, `SocektEventArgs`pool to manage number of connections! I somehow thought it was more and that is without the `MessageManager`
I've got external libraries from the SDK to control the camera, so I think that means I need to use setup Projects. Do you have a link to what to do after just adding a setup project? The microsoft site isn't being very helpful in that regard.
Maybe not the answer you're after, but how about just doing it as a regular app and scheduling it with Windows Task Scheduler? No messing about with timer code, or having to rebuild to change the timer, or worrying about how accurate your timings are.
&gt; maybe I could do the other lab assignments from trying to learn from this example. Nope. That's really not how it works.
Absolutely could do this for you. Not the way this whole learning thing works though...
You misunderstand. Learning requires that you struggle with the problem. I personally DO know how to do this problem. The only reason I know, however is because I've struggled, failed, asked questions, tried different things, GOOGLED questions, failed some more, wracked my brain, and then finally found an answer (I say "an" and not "the" for a reason). I would not deprive you of that experience for any reason. Now, after you try to complete the problem, and you still have issues, you can look at posting your code here and people will critique it. But coming on Reddit and saying "do this for me" is not going to get people to help because: a. Most of us had to go through similar struggles learning to write code and honestly... it's probably the most useful way to learn. b. Most of us understand the principle about fish and fishermen. We don't give fish. We teach fishermen. Come back after you've started writing some code and it blows up. Ask questions then (while posting the code that blew up, of course). You'll likely get a much more favorable response.
Removed: Rule 4. You'll have to make an attempt, and if you still have issues, post questions about those specific issues and the relevant code you used. If you need help even making the first initial steps, maybe /r/learnprogramming or /r/learncsharp would be better suited.
Take a peek at this video; They create a VERY simple project and then at 0:55 they add an additional project to the solution, that project is a "Setup Project" With this you have to add the framework, additional dlls, etc. The video goes fast, so plan on pausing your way through it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0v6hmumCFU
MVVM is a good fit unless you're making a very small application.
You could use XmlDocument. Maybe not as good as the other methods, but it's what I usually use. It uses xpath syntax to find elements. Here's an example: public enum ContentType { textplain, image, whatever }; public sealed class Message { public Message(string message) { message = "&lt;message&gt;&lt;id&gt;0&lt;/id&gt;&lt;displayname&gt;System&lt;/displayname&gt;&lt;content&gt;Welcome to chat!&lt;/content&gt;&lt;time&gt;2017-01-24 00:29:32.0931366&lt;/time&gt;" + "&lt;contenttype&gt;text/plain&lt;/contenttype&gt;&lt;partytype&gt;3&lt;/partytype&gt;&lt;partykey /&gt;&lt;/message&gt;"; XmlDocument xmlContent = new XmlDocument(); xmlContent.LoadXml(message); XmlNode idNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/id"); XmlNode displayNameNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/displayname"); XmlNode contentNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/content"); XmlNode timeNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/time"); XmlNode contenttypeNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/contenttype"); XmlNode partytypeNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/partytype"); XmlNode partykeyNode = xmlContent.SelectSingleNode("/message/partykey"); Id = Int32.Parse(idNode.InnerText, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); DisplayNode = displayNameNode.InnerText; Content = contentNode.InnerText; Time = DateTime.Parse(timeNode.InnerText); ContentType = (ContentType)Enum.Parse(typeof(ContentType), contenttypeNode.InnerText.Replace("/", "")); PartyType = Int32.Parse(partytypeNode.InnerText, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); PartyKey = partykeyNode.InnerText; } public int Id { get; set; } public string DisplayNode { get; set; } public string Content { get; set; } public DateTime Time { get; set; } public ContentType ContentType { get; set; } public int PartyType { get; set; } public string PartyKey { get; set; } }
Where possible, **don't** try the operation in a `checked` context and then catch the exception. Two reasons: 1. Exceptions are for *exceptional* behaviour, not for control flow, and 2. Throwing and catching exceptions is slow in terms of performance. Instead use something like `if (UInt32.MaxValue - b &lt; a)` to detect overflow before it happens; and similar for underflow. For multiplication it's a bit harder, but you could try temporarily upcoercing to `UInt64` and testing that against `UInt32.MaxValue`. Other solutions exist but are fiddly. ---- Edit: Also, you're setting the `containedValue` to `UInt32.MaxValue`, even after an *underflow* in your subtraction operator. I highly doubt that is your intention. Have you written any unit tests?
I don't really see the use case for this, it will just hide overflow bugs. Anyway, in addition to the things the other commenter already mentioned, the conversion to `int` should be `explicit`. To make it behave more like builtin numeric types and avoid having to cast it to `uint`, override `ToString`, and implement things like `IEquatable&lt;T&gt;`, `IComparable&lt;T&gt;`, `IFormattable` and related equality/comparison operators. 
Agreed on all that. If he wants a "capped value" type he should probably implement it properly with configurable limits instead of just the arbitrary limits of 0 and 4294967295.
Great little tutorial series! I do love it when an author picks a subjects and deep-dives it from start to finish, it's much better than having to piece together information from all over the place. I know you're "finished" with it and slightly fatigued, but might I suggest a follow-up series on Message Queuing, like ZMQ, RabbitMQ and similar? I think with a good networking understanding, message queues are a logical progression and it's just different enough that it might be interesting for you.
Hey, this looks very interesting. I've been looking for something like this. Saving it for later.
No, I just pass the class the shit it needs.
What you're describing is p2p, look up p2p socket implementation or p2p networking in C#.
Thank you! 
&gt; Could anyone explain to me, whats with the public class Example thing? Why do I put main inside of a class declaration? C# is a very strongly object-oriented language; which means all code must be inside a class. Usually when C# programs start the code 'begins' from an entry point (`Main`). `Main`, like all other code, must be inside a class. In this case, the class is `Example`. `Example` could be called anything, but it's often just named after the application (I personally call it `EntryPoint`). &gt; Why do I create an inicialize an object inside class declaration? That's not inside a class declaration, that's inside a method that is inside a class. The method is the `Main` method, which I mentioned above.
I got 90/100 in machiine problem! -10 cause i dont have design :D thank you so much!
Thanks! Implementing SSL/TLS is something that someone shouldn't do unless they're really knowledgeable about security. Never roll your own crypto, auth system, or SSL/TLS implementation unless you know what you're doing. If you're looking to simply use that stuff, there are a few other libraries that exist that can help you. For instance, C# ships with an `SslStream` class. I've linked some pages from the MSDN documentation in the `conclusion` section.
If it's OK with /u/def-pri-pub (probably ruined the username typing it on mobile), I may be able to help get an e-book together for it.
And they unrolled it)
Yes, thats the best way to do it, by just deserializing the XML into a compatible object. I read your question as if you'd not know the contents of the XML, but you still want to edit it. Don't worry about it, just keep creating the compatible objects and mapping them, that will be fine.
In that case you read it correctly. I'm given certain properties that will be in every element, but each element may have also other various elements. So it will look like this: - Base class that every element has - various properties that I have no idea off. Thats why I was looking at dynamic objects because I can add properties to them on the fly. Consider this XML. First, Second and Third tags are in both so my class would have such properties and Various ones are the "non-expected" ones. &lt;Companies&gt; &lt;Company&gt; &lt;First&gt;&lt;/First&gt; &lt;Second&gt;&lt;/Second&gt; &lt;Third&gt;&lt;/Third&gt; &lt;FirstVarious&gt;&lt;/FirstVarious&gt; &lt;/Company&gt; &lt;Company&gt; &lt;First&gt;&lt;/First&gt; &lt;Second&gt;&lt;/Second&gt; &lt;Third&gt;&lt;/Third&gt; &lt;SecondVarious&gt;&lt;/SecondVarious&gt; &lt;ThirdVarious&gt;&lt;/ThirdVarious&gt; &lt;/Company&gt; &lt;/Companies&gt;
Thanks very much for this. I need to learn more about Linq and IEnumerables, so this is a really good introduction with relevance to my problem. Thanks.
I had good experiences with the Fundamental of Computer Programming. My two main issues are that it can be very verbose, and it won't really teach anything GUI-related IIRC. So be prepared to skip some stuff, and to look for other sources eventually. I would say it's a good way to get your basics done, up to about chapter 11-13 (after he's done with classes). After that, start looking for other tutorials (I recommend the Unity tutorial projects).
Why is this bad for a large file? And what size file would e large enough to cause problems with this function?
But no one should write code like this though. It's incredibly verbose. Math.Min suddenly takes a whopping 71 characters to spell out when even with ternary it would be 16. private static int YearsDiscount(int years) =&gt; years.Match().To&lt;int&gt;() .Where(y =&gt; y &gt; 5).Do(5) .Else(y =&gt; y) .Result(); Could be written like this: private static int YearsDiscount(int years) =&gt; years &gt; 5 ? 5 : years; Visual Basic has a way better select statement than C#. It isn't an expression (if I remember correctly) but it allows a lot more complicated case expressions. The only thing I miss is the ability to switch on 
I have figured this out, for anyone trying something similar https://sitename.sharepoint.com/_api/web/GetFolderByServerRelativeUrl('Sitename.sharepoint.com/Development/Shared%20Documents') seemed to work for me 
&gt; But no one should write code like this though... "*...It certainly isn’t the way I’d necessarily solve such a problem if starting from scratch. But that isn’t the point of the exercise...*" I certainly did miss the chance to refactor the F# `yearsDiscount` function to the simpler one you suggest though. But, in a classic case of "you can't please all of the people", I then got comments on twitter from an F# fanboy telling me I should replace the `Years = customerType == Unregistered ? 0 : years;` line with an `Option`. Ternaries seem to split opinion all too often. 
what? why should that code display 0...9 ? what am I missing? int i = 0; var a = () =&gt; Console.WriteLine(i); i++; var b = () =&gt; Console.WriteLine(i); a(); // why should this display 0?

Sorry, probably not going to happen.
If you want to send HTTP messages between clients using JSON, The HttpClient can send objects automatically serialised into JSON using JSON.Net. [Here](https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client) is a tutorial that shows how to use HttpClient with WebAPIs but the knowledge can be carried over. 
the bare basics is var myObject = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonCovert.Deserialize&lt;MyType&gt;( await new System.Net.HttpClient().Get("someUrl") ); You'll probably want to make it a tad more robust, for example by having a static HttpClient so you don't overload on connections, but it's roughly this straightforwrad.
I'm not sure what you mean with that as I use uint.MaxValue and uint.MinValue already to get the "capped value" that I desire. Plus it seems more logical to not make it configurable as it is supposed to be a replacement of uint without the actual overflow/underflow and the manually thrown exception.
Really seems like it would be better to do something like a `bool TryIncrement(int i)` function, instead of just swallowing the error in an overloaded operator.
Is this going to be officially supported on IIS?
 double[][] myArray = MyList.ToArray(); That converts `MyList`to an array, but it's still an array containing lists instead of an array containing arrays. You need to convert the individual sub-lists too. Easiest solution would just be double[][] array = myList.Select(list =&gt; list.ToArray()).ToArray();
Moq and Moq.Contrib :D I started bulding up the class again. This is the heart of it. The container is private and I just add more and more helper methods to the base class. [TestClass] public class AutoMockingTest : AutoMockingTestBase { [TestMethod] public void Index_returns_ViewResult() { var userServiceMock = new Mock&lt;IUserServices&gt;(); userServiceMock.Setup(svc =&gt; svc.GetUserFromCookie()).Returns(new Account.Domain.Models.UserProfileModel { }); Register(userServiceMock.Object); var cfgMock = new Mock&lt;IConfigurationService&gt;(); cfgMock.Setup(svc =&gt; svc.DefaultCacheLimit).Returns(10); Register(cfgMock); var cut = Resolve&lt;PlansController&gt;(); var result = cut.Index(); Assert.IsNotNull(result); Assert.IsInstanceOfType(result,typeof(ViewResult)); ViewResult vr = result as ViewResult; Assert.IsInstanceOfType(vr.Model,typeof(BaseViewModel&lt;string&gt;)); } } abstract public class AutoMockingTestBase { private MockRepository Factory; private AutoMockContainer Container; List&lt;Type&gt; autoRegistered = new List&lt;Type&gt;(); public AutoMockingTestBase() { Factory = new MockRepository(MockBehavior.Strict); Container = new AutoMockContainer(this.Factory); } public void Register&lt;T&gt;(T instance) { Container.Register&lt;T&gt;(instance); } public void Register&lt;T&gt;(Mock&lt;T&gt; mock) where T:class { Container.Register&lt;T&gt;(mock.Object); } public T Resolve&lt;T&gt;() { var tot = typeof(T); if (!autoRegistered.Contains(tot)) { autoRegistered.Add(tot); Container.Register&lt;T, T&gt;(); } return Container.Resolve&lt;T&gt;(); } } 
Thank you for your interest. Yes, it will be. We are making final tests and writing documentation before commit. Soon we'll release 1.7, and this version will officially support IIS.
Thank you for your answer. That made it a little clearer for me.
Crystal reports, I feel your pain brother.
Funny enough, it is JSON! JSON actually comes of JavaScript not Java (two completely different languages only named alike thanks to some weird netscape navigator programmer int he 90s...) it's a neutral data transfer schema that some people use for config files (though it's lacked of comments makes it not the best for that.) As other's have suggested JSON.Net is a greay library to get started using it in C#. Do note, it is much more lightweight than XML if bandwidth is a concern -- but it can end up being less human readable when trying to serialize objects to it due to it not supporting attributes like XML does so you can not specify auxiliary data easily without changing your schema.
Variable names (and all other identifiers) must start with a letter or an underscore, they cannot start with digits. If you explain what exactly you're trying to do, maybe there's another solution.
Variable names can't start with a number, and there's no way around it. It would make lines such as `int otherVariable = 40 + 3;` ambiguous: Are we talking about the actual value 40, or the variable named 40? You could try naming it "forty", or something like "name40", "id40", etc. (Also, FYI, you're trying to assign a string to an integer, That won't work even if the variable is named properly)
I finished reading through C# Programming Yellow Book and I found it to be very helpful to grasp the basics and get a little bit of exposure to the more advanced topics. The author is usually pretty clear in his explanations and has a sense of humor in his writing.
Can we get an update button in Visual Studio like it's 2017? My blood boils every time I have to download a 2GB install file and sit there twiddling my thumbs for an hour and a half watching the progress bar not move. While you're at it, Windows update sucks too. 
Maybe this'll help you along :) http://pastebin.com/cjVN4DWU Don't forget to check whether enteredMonth is in between 0 and 12. You can use &lt; or &gt; in an if statement.
I used to think DI was a great idea. Then I worked on some code bases that actually used it. Usually the problem the DI is trying to solve is poor design in the first place.
I'd recommend you to create the library with a name not containing space(or any char like comma, dot etc). Ex SharedDocuments, then rename it afterwards. That way the internal name will be easier(it will not change wen you rename). 
A switch with 12 cases? Why would you ever use that?
I hate to suggest it, but WCF is basically what you're looking for.
Just because a class is large doesn't guarantee that it is bad. Are you using DI? If you want to be able to test using mocks, make your methods non-static and extract an IFileHelperMudBall interface. 
I think the method name kind of gives it away, ServerRelativeUrl. The parameter is supposed to be the relative path from the ServerUrl. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn292553.aspx Here's how the endpoint URI:s are structured https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn292556.aspx
What problem are you trying to solve? You are most likely going about it the wrong way.
It's been a while since I've messed with ClickOnce deployment. But did you try adding the new certificate using MageUI.exe? https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xhctdw55(v=vs.110).aspx Open up your manifest file in mage and click the save button. At that point you'll get a prompt to associate the certificate. You can pick one that's already in your local cert store or add the new one by picking it from the file dialog. (Along with the password) 
Assuming it's literally *never* written to again after the very first read: Yes, but why risk it? Why not use something like a [ReaderWriterLockSlim](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim.aspx) which will have minimal overhead anyway, and provides peace-of-mind? ---- Assuming it's written to more than once (e.g. it is not *immutable* data from the perspective of the readers), **no**. The compiler, the JIT, and the processor are all allowed to make assumptions about your code if you don't explicitly include multithreading primitives. Those assumptions include things like re-ordering statements or completely removing 'fresh' reads; usually done in the name of performance. For example, from a single-threaded perspective, it makes a lot of sense to cache a variable's value rather than go back to main memory all the time if you're using it a lot. The compiler, JIT, and processor *always* assume single-threaded access *only* unless you explicitly make it clear that the memory you're reading from could have been altered since the last read on this thread by an external source (e.g. another thread). ---- I'm actually going to be releasing a blog post shortly about this very thing in a couple of weeks, your question is just a week or two too soon in that respect (frustratingly). But in the meantime I highly recommend reading this blogpost by Eric Lippert: [Can I skip the lock when reading an integer?](http://blog.coverity.com/2014/03/12/can-skip-lock-reading-integer/)
That's correct: You're not going to have any kind of race conditions if you have multiple threads reading from the same data, as long as that data is never modified once it's passed to the threads.
You have been a tremendous help! If you wouldn't mind explaining the rest that would be fantastic, although I do appreciate that typing on a phone can be a meticulous effort.
Do you have discord? We could DM in discord if you like :)
Or you could private message me on here :D
Mono, linux dev. :D
I like how he named the parameters how the fields should be named
for me I seemed to read somewhere that I should call the document library/archive instead which threw me off a bit. thanks for the links I'll need some of the other API services soon I'm sure! 
&gt;Not necessarily, but the presence of the lock makes it harder to just "add a quick write" six months later by accident. When all you see is some random field completely unprotected it's much easier to just idly refactor in something completely broken. So it's just about documentation? In that case, code comments would be much more helpful than a useless lock that future programmers may or may not notice. &gt; It takes someone very smart or very ignorant to write lock-free code. *If the data is mutated*. For immutable shared data, none of this makes any difference.
&gt; So it's just about documentation? Yes, but in the same way that using sensible variable names instead of just `x`, `y`, `z` is 'just' documentation. Comments can be good too but they tend to go out-of-date quickly in a large codebase and are easily ignored. &gt; If the data is mutated. For immutable shared data, none of this makes any difference. Look, if the data is *genuinely* immutable (e.g. `const` or `readonly`) then yes I agree, and the conversation stops there. But the impression I got from OP was that he was writing to a memory location from one thread at some point then later on reading from that location. That means the data *was* mutated at some point, but just not while we're doing a read. Not protecting the read in this scenario is dangerous because there's no memory fence in front of it to prevent the read being moved up earlier in time. A CPU is permitted to prefetch data almost as early as it likes (it can look ahead in the instruction queue to find upcoming reads and schedule them before the instruction is actually 'caught up to'), in order to hide memory latency. It could happily read the memory location before the writer thread has actually written anything. Normally a lock emits a [memory barrier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread.memorybarrier.aspx) to prevent this, as well as exhibiting the more obvious use that people are more familiar with (e.g. ensuring a block of operations are atomic wrt other threads). This kind of stuff is reaching the limits of my ability to reason about, so here's a question I asked about 2 years ago on stackoverflow, demonstrating that without **full memory barriers** you can write to a location in one thread and even though a second thread reads that location later, it still reads an 'older' value: [Volatile fields: How can I actually get the latest written value to a field?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22404109/volatile-fields-how-can-i-actually-get-the-latest-written-value-to-a-field). Notice how the correct fix is to simply put a lock around the access. Now it's my understanding that the failure demonstrated in that question is in actually expecting some kind of 'ordering' when dealing with true parallelism\*. If OP writes to his field and then reads from it 20 seconds later there's probably no issue (not least because the OS will have context switched thousands of times by then anyway). Ultimately I think in this one case he'll probably be okay, which is why I said "Yes", but frankly the amount of thought required to be sure is why I followed it up with a "but why risk it". If you understand all the above and still think it's worth it, then fine; we'll just have to agree to disagree. I understand that you may have a stronger grasp on these fundamentals than me, but I don't think the average user does, and I don't, and therefore I stand by my suggestion to just use the lock. :D \*as well as not quite getting that memory fences are there to prevent reordering on the local thread only and are not synchronization primitives; but that's somewhat orthogonal here
No reason your data later cannot be files; it's just a persistence medium. I'd try using IOC/DI as suggested to clean up and decouple the code. You can go the repository/unit of work approach with files but you should consider if the effort is worth it or not for small utilities. If you want something highly reusable/portable then it's good idea but for small single purpose utilities it may be a overkill. The cool thing about going towards a repository pattern, especially when paired with DI, is you could easily switch out your persistence medium in the future with minimal to no impact on your business and presentation layers. Probably not useful as most apps realistically won't do this but it's still cool.
Going to disagree with the top post here. If something's immutable, then YES, feel free to read from it concurrently. That's part of the magic of immutability. If you use a lock, then you're adding unnecessary contention. This is all assuming you actually DO have immutability and follow good practices. That is, if something's immutable, then its interface should be immutable (not just "hey, here's operations X, Y, and Z but you're actually only supposed to use X and Z), so on and so forth.
&gt; Therefore my recommendation would be to always lock every access to a field that can be shared across threads, even if you think that eliding the lock is 99.99% likely to be harmless. The nano-scale benefit is simply not worth the macro-scale costs of verifying that the elision is correct, and certainly not worth the risk that the code is incorrect now or might become incorrect in the future. Code which avoids locks is extremely difficult to reason about, so make your life easier: if you can, don’t write shared memory code to begin with. If you have to, use locks consistently. This is misleading as that advice is on lock-free programming vs using interlocked e.g. atomic CAS operations. 
Try to keep you classes down to as few concerns as possible - ideally down to one. For example: converting an business class into a stream does not mean you need to know anything about the FileSystem. Likewise when your business class attempts to save itself, does it need to know how it's being saved? Should business classes even know how to persist themselves at all? Maybe break apart your mud ball into relate task, such as those methods that change the business models to and from xml - put them in an XmlModelConverter. And those in charge of changing business models to and from text in another - TextModelConverter. The IO portion gets small real quick in that it only needs the xml / text that came out of the converters. Later on when another format comes in, add another converter and you are good to go. You can even go down later on with dependency inversion. If you build the converters to an interfaces you swap out converters(JSON instead of XML) or IO (webresponse instead of file) via configuration instead of hardcoding. I'm a really big fan of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) and it has help me break big classes down to something more manageable.
Careful, this line `int unShiftedIndex = (curIndex - key) % alphabet.Length;` doesn't do what you think it does. That's because C#'s `%` yields the remainder.In your case with a key of 10: unShiftedIndex = (5-10)%26 = -5, which is certainly not what you're looking for(you get an IndexOutOfRangeException)
I am fairly sure reading double and long is not thread safe in any of the major languages. 
Generally - no. What appars as reading could still hold and mutate state. Let's say you have a dictionary, and axess values through the property acessor - but for some reason it does something special (increment a counter, although increments are mostly atomic, let's say it's a special counter). Then what looks like safe reading is actually writing in disguise. In practice those situations are rare. And reading primitives is obviously safe - although initializing them across threads might still need locks. 
Thank you! Those are good ideas to implement. I just wanted to get basic functionality before I dealt with those corner cases. I will have to look into StringBuilder because I have never used one before. Also I tried to add captions to the imgur images to describe this "weird" behavior. But I probably should have reiterated these problems within my post. Kindest Regards.
May I ask how long you have been programming? I used to think DI was a solution looking for a problem, then I worked on a project that implemented it badly and believed it was a stupid idea. Then I worked on a project that did it right, the concept clicked in my brain and now I realise it's usefulness. 
The amount of time is irrelevant unless you're going to make an appeal to experience, which is pretty stupid in an entirely anecdotal discussion, but 25 years. DI is a simple concept, dressed up with a fancy name and made more complicated than it needs to be. In the best case, all you're doing is simplifying things by packing dependencies into a single object and passing that in instead of passing everything individually. In the worst case, you're 'DI' is actually a big ball of mud and everything depends on everything. A concept that has gotten a similar treatment lately is the monad. It's just function composition. It doesn't need to be made complicated and scary.
Maybe you can use: 40 = Convert.ToString(_40);
&gt; Is DI the solution to this problem? There are few scenarios where DI is not the answer, to be honest. It goes hand in hand with clean abstractions, coding to the interface and not the implementation ("concrete type"), and decoupling your classes etc. It just promotes good design and makes changing code in the future much easier, as well as allow for good unit testing with mocks. I recommend NSubstitute as a mocking framework, personally.
You shouldn't really be using exceptions for control flow, exceptions are for 'exceptional circumstances'. You could replace try { typeOfCypher = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); } catch (FormatException e) { continue; } With something along the lines of while(!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out typeOfCyhper)) { //let the user know they entered an invalid selection } 
I heard ordering by _id is not raccomended, though, since it is based on the client clock, thus not really the best way to order it. What does all the async stuff do? Do I need to make all the method async? (You don't have to ecplain it to me, just give me something to read to get started on the concept)
Didn't know about the client clock; I always had my own timestamp field so never needed to order on _id. Good to know, thanks! You don't have to make anything async if you don't want to - it's just good practice nowadays (in most situations). Find() is fine as well.
Thank you for the suggestion! My question is: will this continue to prompt the user for a correct response? Like if I added: Console.WriteLine("That is in invalid response"); Will the control flow back into the loop and prompt the user again?
Sort of. It creates a state machine when await is used and will return back to your function later (when the awaited operation has completed) to allow other operations to continue. You can effectively stop UI freezes and such. The reason I recommend async is because in this context, you're using it in conjunction with a database operation which can be relatively slow. Using async allows other processes to continue. It's great to use for example in ASP.NET as all Actions can be async, allowing ASP.NET itself to continue serving requests while an action might be await'ing something. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14177891/can-somebody-please-explain-async-await for a better explanation :)
It surely won't hurt you. Pracise is always good. Maybe getting out of your field and doing something else for a while gets some fresh air in and helps you approach your current problems in a different way. I'd go for it \^\^
I think it always depends on what you mean by "becoming a better programmer". You can learn and practice almost every part of a programming language and its principles and design patterns by just programming whatever you like. But as a developer you surely know that there are not only things like the programming language itself to learn but also miscellaneous technologies like libraries, frameworks [...]. If your focus is on improving for your job I'd definitely stay on this kind of applications (Front-End/Backend, WPF/ASP.NET [...] ). But since programming is mostly not only a job but often becomes a private field of interest no one prevents you to do game programming privately. It surely will also help to improve your overall knowledge but won't be as efficient as e. g. programming business applications which will be more applicable to your job. 
It *can't* be truly immutable if he's talking about arrays and lists (which he did indeed mention). Hence my suggestion to use a lock. Write to it once using the writer lock, ensuring a store-release fence, and then read in perpituity with no worries. Anything else in unnecessarily risky. 
Interlocked *is* a lock-free construct, and no, Eric is talking about eliding **locks**. For evidence of this, see that there *is* no Interlocked construct for reading a int (the subject of the article); because that's already an atomic operation (which is what the Interlocked class provides) in non-unsafe C#. If you read the article in full you'll see he, like me, sees the tradeoff of 20ns pause vs the potential unsafeness of eliding a lock to be rather ill-advised.
Programming in Unity some 3 odd years ago really helped me develop as a c# developer. Probably is the reason why I got a job as a .net developer too. It is really good practice for OOP skills.
I meant lock-free programming (using e.g. interlocked) vs blocking synchronization primitives (e.g. mutexes). Also, the structure he discusses is still mutable. If we're talking about a fully immutable structure then things are very different.
They are atomic if you're running on 64 bit, but not on 32 bit.
If you write a dedicated server it certainly will. Scaleable game dev is incredibly challenging.
Yup, I think that'll fit your needs and clean up your code nicely. 
"Will programming make me a better programmer?"
Consider `Enumerable.Range('a', 26).Select(x =&gt; (char)x).ToArray()`, btw. 
Absolutely. There isn't a single programming practice (I can think of) that couldn't be used for gaming. There are some, perhaps, that don't get used often, but that doesn't mean you couldn't adapt them to gaming.
Cheers man, will give this a go at work tomorrow.
Absolutely, almost one in the same 
Oh, yeah, sorry. I'll edit that. I jumped the gun a little. How do I get the calculations in? I want to use monthlySalary (done already), yearlySalary, and newSalary. Would I declare these somewhere under my Employee class or EmployeeTest class? I have a Console.WriteLine to show the calculations (it shows when I run it Employee1's yearly salary is:), but I'm not sure how to get the calculations in there. I don't even know if that makes any sense...I can take a screen shot of what I have, but it's a horrible mess I'm sure and I don't feel like being laughed at anymore today.
&gt; That being said, I did get the classes made. There should be only one employee class definition. And two instances of that class. &gt; newSalary = (yearlySalary * .10) + yearlySalary The only property specified in the assignment is monthly salary (for salary stuff anyways) so calculate against that value. This could be a method that does the calculation and assigns the new value to monthlySalary -- such as: void GiveRaise(decimal percentageRaise) You will also need a method to display yearly salary, and the calculation for yearly salary can be done there. void DisplayYearlySalary(Employee employee) Inside this method perform your calculation for yearly salary and output to the console. Once you have that setup all you need to do is to create two employees (new keyword), pass each to the DisplayYearlySalary, then give them raises and again pass each to DisplayYearlySalary. 
&gt; being as efficient as possible so game developers really put time in building efficient functions And this right here in itself is worth the dabble. I have seen so many enterprise applications lose sight of optimization because of the forest of five nine availability, load balancing, redundancy, data integrity, etc. I mean sure enterprises can usually afford to just throw more hardware at a scaling problem but it seems so wasteful. 
I didn't even know that C# had mascot and I have been programming in it for eight or more years.
From previous experience, I try to never use anything from Microsoft that is not an actual release. I did use the preview tooling for .Net Core, and it was awful.
&gt; I feel like this is some ancient language that only certain people can still read. Well, it isn't ancient, but it IS a language that only certain people can read. It's why good software engineers get paid the big bucks. &gt; This book doesn't do a very good job of saying exactly what everything is. What book are you reading? Maybe it legit is a bad book. That said, the jump from procedural programming to OOP is a big one. I still remember when object oriented code was such a strange abstract way of thinking. It's quite easy now. In fact, I did your assignment in about 5 minutes (no exaggeration.) The thing is you very literally have to struggle with this simple example. It's the only way your brain will truly understand this way of thinking. &gt; don't they have to be labeled 1 and 2 because there are two employees? If no one has told you yet, a CLASS is not a real object. It's more or less like a template. When you create an INSTANCE of the class, then all the features in the class become real. So let's say that you've managed to create a Class called "Employee" with all the features that you're supposed to add. When you create two employees it'll happen like so: var employeeList = new List&lt;Employee&gt;() { new Employee("Joe", "Public", 1400.50), new Employee("Jane", "Doe", 1500.75) }; foreach (var employee in employeeList) { var fullName = string.Format("{} {}", employee.firstName, employee.lastName); employee.monthlySalary = employee.monthlySalary * 1.10; // 10% raise! woo hoo! } I'm not gonna show you how to make the classes as you need to figure that out on your own. The code above shows creating 2 new Employee types and adding them to a List object (like an Array). Then it iterates over each item (employee) in the employeeList. Because each item in the list is an Employee type, they all have the same features. (like a template. Except that it's called a Class.)
Maybe not game programming, but making a rudimentary engine surely will help you learn some advanced concepts!
Keep telling yourself that.
The biggest (or second biggest, doesn't really matter) mobile OS in the world uses it as it's main programming language. The second biggest selling video game ever uses it. Google, Amazon, EBay, LinkedIn, and Facebook all use Java. But I'm sure you know better than these folks.
I concur, pracise makes perfect.
https://dotnetfiddle.net/ or http://pastebin.com/ ideally use a site like these which nicely format your code. makes it easier for us to read, identify problems, and provide solutions. as far as being laughed at.. i can't speak for everyone, but the general vibe is that most people are here to get their problems solved, help solve other problems, and share cool articles/things they've learned.
If you want something truly different you could try functional programming. 
Ok, now I can put up what I have. [Right Here](http://imgur.com/a/vmPjE) Everything with a comment I started with, but as I went on it kept giving me errors. I figured I'd let it fix it and see what happens and maybe I'll figure out what I'm doing wrong. BAD IDEA. It just made me more confused. Our instructor hasn't graded them yet but it'll probably be another few days before he does. I really (so far) enjoy programming. I've had run ins with different languages here and there which got me interested, but it wasn't ever something that they encouraged girls to do when I was a kid. I feel like I can get this, but there's some key or puzzle piece that I'm missing for it to click. I think maybe I get all the terms confused, which is where the book isn't very good at explaining them. They give a sort of general definition and then a complicated example. We're using Visual C3: How to Program 6th ed. by Dietel and Dietel. It's really not a terrible book, but I feel like they assume we already know the basic components even though it's meant to be very basic. Everyone else in class had a hard time with this assignment, too. There's only 6 of us though, so that's not saying much. I don't want to give up. I'm not the kind of person to give up. Besides youTube and courses from udemy or something, is there anything "offline" I can do/read/use?
I've certainly never been accused of being weak hearted. I also prefer mentally taxing exercises with my own brain to (in general) mentally taxing interactions with others. I have no doubt I can do that part, I just feel like there's something I'm missing to make this click for me. I'm going to have to review all the terms - the book isn't exactly clear on that part. I appreciate the encouragement! really, I do... :) Thanks
&gt; If no one has told you yet, a CLASS is not a real object. It's more or less like a template. I think this is definitely where I got confused because the examples in the book that go through the chapter (making the bank accounts and adding deposits) labels them as account1 and account2. 
Funny enough, the book has only touched one dot notation. It says that it exists and then it uses it in examples. I'm sure somewhere in the book it goes into how to use it and why, but so far - nada. BUT this does makes sense...
This is incredibly helpful. I did have a list, but it wasn't as "drilled down" and specific (obviously, because I didn't know) as you have it here. This makes it much more understandable and I can see where everything goes. Being able to "see" the list in the problem from now on will be easier. Thank you.
I only didn't post over there because it's been a month or more since anyone has been over there and not many posts have replies. I didn't want it to die a slow death over there.
Yes, account1 and account2 are not classes though, they are instances of a class. They are taking the account class (template) and allowing you to assign different values to the properties of that class. Think of account1 and account2 as different objects that have separate properties of the Account class. For example, you keep your money in a bank, and you have a few separate acounts, one for savings, one for spending money, and one for bills. To fully describe these accounts, there are a set of properties that each must have, AccountName, Type (savings/checking), Balance, OwnerName for example. This will be your class Account{}. It will lay out the specific data that is required to fully describe each account. Now, you have a template to describe your bank accounts but each one of your accounts will have a different value for these properties, a different AccountName, type, and balances. This is where account1 and account2 come in. Here you are instantiating a different object for each of your bank accounts that must fit the structure of the Account class but can have different values for each object: Account account1 = new Account(); account1.AccountName="Bills"; account1.Type="My Checking"; account1.Balance = 3.00; Account account2 = new Account(); account2.AccountName="My Savings"; account2.Type="Savings"; account2.Balance=4.50;
C++ and Java are just worse versions of C#. You would be surprised just how easy learning the others will be.
Why can't the book just say this? This makes much more sense. So when you are doing account1.AccountName = "Bill" do you have to put the AccountName anywhere else or is it a local variable? Local variables get deleted after the program has run, right? I think part of my issue was that I thought in order to use account1.AccountName I had to say (declare, whatever) what AccountName was going to be before I used it. Right? So, I called them (Employee and EmployeeTest) classes because that's what I had to choose when adding something new into the project. Is EmployeeTest not a class? I keep forgetting the word instance. I don't know why. It makes a lot more sense to look at it like a template that can be "copied" over and over again, but how does it know what AccountName, Type, and Balance are? Don't you have to say that you're going to be using them and what the parameters (if any) are going to be?
Your really close here. First, your GetYearlySalary functions are not implemented correctly. You'll want to just use your Employee Class' YearlySalary property for this, not a function outside of your Employee class. Since you already have a Salary property (monthly salary), your YearlySalary property doesn't need to store a separate value, it just needs to manipulate the Salary property to return the yearly salary instead of the monthly salary. It should look something like this: public decimal YearlySalary{ get { return this.Salary*12; } set { this.Salary=value/12; } } now, when you want to print a yearly salary in your main() function, it will look like this: Console.Writeline($"{employee1.First} {employee1.Last}'s yearly salary: {employee1.YearlySalary:C}"); The second issue is that your Raise function is expecting a percentage but applying it as a straight value. You'll want to set Salary equal to Salary + Salary*raiseAmount/100 here instead of just adding raiseAmount. Now, after this you are correctly reading in a raise percentage from the user, but you never call your raise function. you'll want to call it for both employees like this: employee1.Raise(raiseAmount1); employee2.Raise(raiseAmount2); and then repeat your Console.WriteLine commands to print out the data again, this time with the new values. 
I will definitely be looking at this. Thanks!
Yes, local variables will be lost after the program has run. In this case at the end of the Main() function but you can use it throughout the main function after it has been declared for example: decimal MyTotalCash = account1.Balance + account2.Balaince; You don't need to declare account1.AccountName before you use it but you do need to declare account1 as an instance of the Account class before you can use account1.AccountName like this: Account account1 = new Account(); This says, I want to create a variable named account1 that is of type account and then allocate memory for all of the properties described in the Account class. This creates a real object that has all of the properties of your Account class (or template) that can be assigned and manipulated. It's kind of like your class is a blueprint and when you call Account account1 = new Account(). You are saying here is the blueprint, now build me one of these so that I can use it. When you say Account account2 = new Account(), you are saying now build me another one that is the same type of thing but has separate and independent values from account1.
OK! So, at first I started with public decimal monthlySalary (then after a while it told me that was wrong, it told me it had to be private). I see where you started with public decimal MonthlySalary. * Why did you add the private monthlySalary? To do the calculations? and it's private because you're doing that calculation inside the Employee class, right? Now, where you entered your public Employee constructor (your 2nd block) is this. an arbitrary word or does "this" mean something? The book doesn't say if you can just make these up into something that makes sense and is readable. That's definitely a part that confuses me because I never know where they're getting these words from. 
with these, do you use the {get; set;} or just leave them how you have them? Does it make a difference?
NEW QUESTION! I see some of you did the calculations differently though I'm sure you all get the same result. Is it easier to just multiply by 1.10 to get the new salary amount instead of what /u/SnOrfys did or would doing that prepare the code if down the line you wanted to add more calculations? Does that make any sense?
You don't need to use {get; set;} but doing so allows you more control and flexibility over the property. Let's go back to your Employee example: public class Employee{ public Employee(){ } public decimal MonthlySalary; public decimal YearlySalary{ get { return MonthlySalary * 12; } set{ MonthlySalary = value /12; } } } In this case your class has two decimal properties but they are tied together. When you get the yearly salary employee1.YearlySalary it is not an independent property but it is based on MonthlySalary and returns the value in monthly salary times 12. When you set employee1.YearlySalary = 12000 it is not setting an independent value but setting MonthlySalary to 1000. So if you did this in your Main(): Employee employee1= new Employee(); employee1.MonthlySalary=10000; decimal thisYearlySalary = employee1.YearlySalary; employe1.YearlySalary = 24000; decimal thatMonthlySalary = employee1.MonthlySalary the value of thisYearlySalary would be 120000 and the value of thatMonthlySalary would be 2000.
Could you also print the "but why" gif?
What book are you using?
It is not "so bad" it is "normally bad". But here are some reasons - Wrapper types for primitive types - checked exceptions - generics that suck (i.e. no List&lt;int&gt; and can be broken at runtime) - no properties
It's simple. The comment section of the original post was a bunch of "but I can do this in MS Word" type comments. 
For real though, use it.
It's a little expensive, but I love RedGate's ANTS. Profiles SQL too.
Ironically I've only ever really used cecil for injecting code to cheat at games. It feels weird to think of cecil from the gamedev side. PS: setting the application type to console makes all this like a lot easier.
If this inspires some little kids to program, it has served a noble purpose. 
Im likely missing the point but couldn't you just store the information in a dictionary?
To teach you how to use switch?
That naming convention makes my skin crawl.
Using a dictionary to store enum values? Never seen that before.
This is a programming subreddit.
Why do you want to open run? What are you hoping to achieve in doing that?
I am pretty sure you can get the .net sdk as part of the [windows sdk](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
That only installs the one for .NET 4.6. I explicitly need the .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.0 SDK's
They use the same compiler, but different reference libraries. And nothing I can find has the reference libraries for .NET 4.0 or .NET 4.5. Which specifically means I can't build my libraries for those versions, which are actually very important for me to be able to do.
I find the real time constraints and visceral feedback of game programming to be immensely challenging and rewarding. Having done it professionally for the past four years and worked on a good sized, successful, shipping 3D game I can say there's a ton of value in game programming for any coder. However, I strongly discourage walking into it with the enterprise software, layers of abstraction, object oriented mindset. You're going to miss most of the value with that approach. Don't use Unity, don't use a memory managed language, and don't try to build a bunch of fancy, generic systems. My thoughts? Build a tiny 2D engine in C (or super minimal C++). Manage your own memory, think about what the CPU is actually doing, what caches are doing, learn to think in terms of data flow, structure your code around the data. Consider Handmade Hero for reference and data oriented programming a la Mike Acton. Do this, and even if it doesn't end up being your cup of tea, you will be a better, more well rounded programmer, able to pull from two vastly different mindsets. I started down this path a couple of years ago after 2 years of a more "traditional" C# software development approach in Unity and I'm a *significantly* more effective programmer now because of it.
This site has pretty clear likes to all the different versions of .NET http://getdotnet.azurewebsites.net/target-dotnet-platforms.html
This subreddit isn't a "hey gais halp me homewerk" Read the content and do the assignment. You can ask very specific questions, but don't go around asking people to do your homework for you.
Nice job!
I figured one of you would show up eventually. I have not and I never will ask anyone to do my work for me. The other day I asked for some help to clarify some things. I got really turned around for a lot of different reasons. Quite a few people here helped set me straight. I appreciate it very much. I went back to do this assignment and I actually understood what it wanted. I feel good about that and I'm not going to let a sourpuss like you knock me down. Also: "Hey guys! Help me do my homework?" ftfy :)
Thanks!
So I can give it a parameter to access file on another server without login into the server.
You can build to 4.5 with 4.6. Do note that 4.5 is no longer supported which may be why you can't find the SDK anymore.
There can be confusion since it comes under two names, and the NuGet listing is Newtonsoft.
As it should be.
Whilst your username might disagree with me I feel that we shouldn't have memes among the top posts here.
You should have the timer spawn a new thread to execute Ext1 every time it goes off, then reset the timer. The main thread will only wait and monitor the console; Ext1 will have to run in a separate thread to keep from blocking the main thread's scheduling.
We shouldn't have them at all here.
Taking a long time to execute in a timer thread is generally not a good idea. That said, the timer will just execute Ext1 concurrently if you fail to finish in time. The following program demonstrates this: void Main() { var t = new Timer(x =&gt; Boom(), null, 0, 1000); Thread.Sleep(6000); t.Change(-1, -1); } void Boom() { Console.WriteLine("Boom enter"); Thread.Sleep(1500); Console.WriteLine("Boom leave"); } output: Boom enter Boom enter Boom leave Boom enter Boom leave Boom enter Boom leave Boom enter Boom leave Boom enter Boom leave Boom leave Notice how multiple Boom calls are executing at the same time.
That's debatable; it avoids forgetting a letter, although it does presuppose knowledge about the unicode ordering of the letters a-z.
&gt; You shouldn't really be using exceptions for control flow, exceptions are for 'exceptional circumstances'. Yes... although what's exceptional is not easy to define always, and the framework also uses exceptions for what I would call control flow :/. In this case I tend to agree, though.
There are other kinds of humor, though :)
If we could have less "I can't type this exact question into Google myself"-posts, I'd be fine with a humor post now and then ;)
Oh /u/cryo, you're so funny!
You're trying to do a spinlock which it seems you're failing at; you're not checking if the result has completed, and you're not looping but there is really no need. Implement IInvokable as an awaitable and you should be able to `await` it instead. Be advised that there is some work implementing an awaitable because you are responsible for delegating the continuation. If not you should use a synchronization primitive to signal that the work is done (which you would have to do with an awaitable as well) rather than spinlocking. This will save you a very significant amount of CPU work.
&gt; ldstr allocates memory to a new string object that is created from the string literal. That string object's reference is then pushed on the stack. Then it do a Call on the method which will use the string on the stack as its parameter. So yes, the string literal is in the assembly. But, at runtime, this literal is simply an operand to create a string object. So you do have memory allocation that will need to be dealt with by the garbage collector. But `ldstr` will only create the string object once. And that object is not gonna be garbage collected - it stays with the lifetime of your application. &gt; The Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) guarantees that the result of two ldstr instructions referring to two metadata tokens that have the same sequence of characters return precisely the same string object (a process known as "string interning"). [Source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.ldstr\(v=vs.110\).aspx) Assuming your statement is true (that the string object is eligible for garbage collection), then the statement from the MSDN page regarding the `ldstr` operation can't be true. If the string object is garbage collected it would need to create a new instance, in which case it's not the same string object anymore.
Good.
Will this then affect VS 2017 RC? If yes, it would the "RC" label even more hilarious. Edit: I assume I am downvoted by people who think it's fine to call a product which undergoes multiple non-bugfix changes "RC". Mind explaining why?

DI itself isn't the answer, but it will put you on the right path. You don't need to use a container at first, you can start with Pure DI (Manual construction) http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/11/06/WhentouseaDIContainer/ 
`s` is a `string`, so `s is int i` will always fail and `i` will never be assigned. But it remains it scope...
It's a technical sub for technical posts and comments.
Lovely :p
Actually I am pretty sure this code fails to compile on that if statement with `error CS8121: An expression of type string cannot be handled by a pattern of type int.` Were the code instead: var s = new object(); if (s is int i) Console.WriteLine($"i={i}, s={s}"); Console.WriteLine(i); The error would be `error CS0165: Use of unassigned local variable 'i'` 
/r/ProgrammerHumor perhaps?
The latest version, `VS15.0.0-RC.3+26127.0` implements the latest rules (leakage from `if` only).
Whyyyyyyyyyy... Make it strict in the first place! If variables leak out of if-expressions it will stay that way forever! It seems like laziness to keep the current rules.
Other than `InvokeFunTarget&lt;T&gt;` not calling `WaitHandle.Set()` this looks pretty good to me.

And that patterns and out variables should have the same scoping rules (I think this tie up is the real culprit). I'm totally ok with "out variables in the surrounding block scope" if (!int.TryParse(someString, out var i)) return; // have i accessible here with the logic being that the `out var` syntax is pure syntactic sugar with a hidden declaration statement in the surrounding block: int i; if (!int.TryParse(someString, out i)) return; // have i accessible here This is a straightforward simplification of existing C# (and I agree with them that this second statement is very common)... but I don't immediately see the connection with pattern variables: if (!(s is int i)) return; // use i... This is something entirely new (depending on which pattern is used, a number of different IL instructions are generated).
It actually launches the code without attaching the debugger. A side-effect is just that it adds that "press any key" thing at the end. Not sure why those two come together to be honest.
I thought it was because it was some sort of educational thing or something.... why would you want to leave off the debugger?

Remembering that comments can be "why"s instead of "what"s is helpful. This was only Chp 3. I did my comments like the book because the last time I didn't I got points taken off. When I was writing this, it kept asking me if I wanted to declare in the same like (put it together or something) and I did to see what happens and it did the same thing you did here. He doesn't want that for now. He wants it spelled out and separated so we can see what's happening. I only know this because another student did it this way and was told he had to redo it. -shrug- what are we gonna do? lol
what is the ++?
/u/Gambleon covered the bullet points. The slightly longer version is that as your skill in WPF grows you should never use "drag and drop" for WPF because it, frankly, gives you bad WPF. You should learn and familiarize yourself with the [WPF Panel Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754152(v=vs.110\).aspx). By knowing when to use a Grid vs. a Stack Panel you'll write better WPF and by extension design better UIs.
The best practice for comments is to explain *why* something is being done. It couldn't hurt to do that in conjunction with your required comments. Also, reason for this is probably so you get in the habit of commenting at all. If you're working with experienced developers, they will know why the syntax means and what it does. What helps most is to explain why, or break down an algorithm so they don't have to waste time. Good job!
Thinking a little more, a waithandle is rather low level for this (and I think this code to use it is slightly wrong because EventWaitHandle doesn't have a parameter-less constructor that I see). I'd suggest instead using a TaskCompletionSource: https://gist.github.com/bbarry/e0271bc18b79647e0d5cf5ef6ed67210 With that in mind, the resulting code can be considerably further simplified (a task I'll leave to someone else). 
Debug this full program to see what I mean: using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace ConsoleApp1 { internal class Program { private static void Main() { while (!Debugger.IsAttached) { Thread.Sleep(100); } Debugger.Break(); //ensure the relevant windows are available at this point (particularly the cpu graph in the diagnostics window Spin(); Wait(); Spin(); Wait(); Spin(); Wait(); Debugger.Break(); } private static void Spin() { var stopWatch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew(); var dummy = new Test(false); dummy.Complete = false; Task.Run(() =&gt; dummy.Invoke()); while (!dummy.Complete) { if (stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds &gt; 5000) return; } stopWatch.Stop(); return; } private static void Wait() { var dummy = new Test(false); dummy.Complete = false; Task.Run(() =&gt; dummy.Invoke()); dummy.Task.Wait(5000); } } class Test { private bool v; private TaskCompletionSource&lt;int&gt; tsc; public Test(bool v) { this.v = v; tsc = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;int&gt;(); } public void Invoke() { Thread.Sleep(4500); tsc.TrySetResult(1); Complete = true; } public Task Task =&gt; tsc.Task; public bool Complete { get; set; } } } 
That's a good question. I can't remember if the update will fail because the cert doesn't match during update. It's been a while. I'll look around. 
For him, using only public properties is fine. But I hope you didn't mean that as a sweeping piece of advice!

I finally found them. The 4.0 one was a PITA to install. It comes in the Windows 7 SDK, but that fails to install normally because it doesn't see .NET 4.6 as a valid platform. So that required a regedit hack to get working. And then the 4.5 one came from the Windows 8 (not 8.1) sdk. All the 8 links redirected to 8.1, so had to dig for that one to find the installer.
I whole heartedly agree. Want to do something common but doesn't fit their cookie cutter mold? Have fun with a sphagetti mess of events. Want to tweak that simple border for a theme? Here's their dog shit theme editor that is horrible for multiple reasons but also makes upgrading a disaster.
Great demo!! Thank you!
That's ok. I will play a little bit with that. Thanks for you suggestion though!
check out [this link](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/339835/Send-Email-using-SMTP-in-Csharp). You could possible execute this code everytime an exception is caught.
Why don't you simply declare and instantiate a `FormTest` in your main class, call `ShowForm()` *only once*, `UpdateForm(string text)` as needed, alongside one more method in your FormTest class, `ToggleForm()`, which hides\displays the form?
You should use a proper logging framework, such as [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog).
&gt; And that patterns and out variables should have the same scoping rules Yes I think thats more what its about. The x.TryParse example is just syntactic sugar so that you can skip the declaration of the out variable before the if, but the scoping is the same as if you had declared the out variable. 
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to read this post, but it makes me happy when I see someone excited about getting past programming hurdles. Kudos!
The top post ever is a picture of my humourous cup...What more do you want!?
`var` just lets the compiler fill in the type, it's still statically- and strongly-typed.
What's the purpose? Are you doing this an exercise to load libraries at runtime? Or do you simply want to use this form that exists in a separate library. If it is the later, then you can either add the DLL as a reference in the main windows forms application. Or even better add the DLL as second project in the solution and reference the project. Then you can instantiate it as you would another object. The default namespace of classes is the assembly name, so you'd have to fully qualify the name: MyFormsTest.FormsTest testDialog = new MyFormsTest.FormsTest(); or: using MyFormsTest; FormsTest testDialog = new FormsTest(); If the exercise is load a the assembly on the fly. You can use various methods on the Assembly class to load it, find the type you are looking for (FormsTest) and then use Activator.CreateInstance to create it. At that point though you have to also use reflection to find the ShowForm method and invoke via the method info or assign a dynamic object which is ugly as well. Both also have a performance hit. Dynamic dispatch is slower. 
TODO's are great during development, but they better be turned into well defined user stories and put into your product backlog before you commit!
Ugh, I sound like a PM. //TODO: slash wrists 
For comments, use comments to describe the why (EG: Your assignment). I looked at the code before reading your assignment and was wondering why you would do the console writes as separate lines. So: using System; /* * Assignment 4 Exercise 3.14: A4 E3-14.cs * Display numbers 1-4 on the same line through different methods * * Write an app that displays the numbers 1 through 4 on the same line, with each pair of adjacent numbers separated by one space. Write the app using the following techniques: * a) Use one Console.WriteLine statement. * b) Use four Console.Write statements. * c)Use one Console.WriteLine statement with four int variables and string interpolation. */ class Assign4 { static void Main() { // A) Use one Console.WriteLine statement Console.WriteLine("\n\t1 2 3 4"); // B) Use four Console.Write statements Console.Write("\t1 "); Console.Write("2 "); Console.Write("3 "); Console.Write("4"); // C) Use one Console.WriteLine statement with four int variables and string interpolation. int number1 = 1; int number2 = 2; int number3 = 3; int number4 = 4; string phrase = "I declare a thumb war"; Console.WriteLine($"\n\t{number1} {number2} {number3} {number4}, {phrase}!\n"); } } This is concise (except the very top portion, but it gives a reason for WHY you are doing this program) and gives a *reason for the code existing* which is what comments are good for.
Just post the source code in a convenient place so people can look at it. If it's a multi-file thing, preferably put it on GitHub.
&gt; while (!Debugger.IsAttached) { &gt; Thread.Sleep(100); &gt; } What do you mean it doesn't? Just run a bench mark in release mode and open up visual studios resource monitor tools...
what he said. use online repo if you ever want help with code, and link to the code whenever you ask a question:) GitHub is free to use for public projects i believe.
I would ~love~ to code a cross-platform GUI in C# without having to use Mono
Maybe you should read up on what `var` actually does.
Maybe I should have qualified it with "... instead of public fields". In that context, I generally do mean it sweepingly. 
I think it tries too hard to look like Visual Studio, which I dislike
Thanks! How much work was involved in the port?
The port was very straightforward. The most difficult things were the portions that relied on mono's DllMap feature, which isn't supported on .NET Core. The bindings for OpenAL and SDL2 are a couple examples. I had to rewrite all of the PInvoke declarations to work around that.
Why? I don't think it's a bad thing to give .net developers a tool that looks like something that they're already familiar with.
oh
yes
"hahahahahahahaha"....?
Seems not bad for a beginner however im a bit Rusty with my C# skills. What I would do next, is create a new Class for the MainMenu or a new class for the whole Menu and Input-Output functions just so you get a feeling for OOP. Try thinking about that a bit. Maybe look up some design patterns, inheritance, interfaces etc. It's very fun to do.
By the way, you mean VS2017 RC; it's not released yet.
X++ returns x and increments it by one ++X increments x and returns it 
To be honest i don't even know about creating classes and calling classes... but i'll get a read on it, thanks!

Probably because you've never had an interaction with yourself.

Use its [`SelectedIndex` property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.selector.selectedindex%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).
Have you looked up the documentation at least? ListBox has a SelectedIndex property which returns -1 if no item is selected, while ListView has a SelectedIndices property(from which you'd access only the item at index 0, if any, assuming that MultiSelect is false).
Yes I have, I'm not sure how to incorporate that into an integer I can use as an index for my list.
You can still use older version of C#. IDE is in RC state, language is in its own development stage. Even if they release VS 2017 RTM with unfinished C# 7 beta, they can release support for the final version of the language with later VS update. The problem here is the possibility, that MS would not communicate that properly.
Perhaps you need to better describe your requirements. If you have a `List&lt;string&gt;`, and you want to look up in that list the same index as selected in the `ListView`, it's just `myListOfStrings[myListView.SelectedIndex]`.
But the index is usually either -1 or 0 right? If there are 5 items to select from in the ListView that means there are 5 items in my listOfStrings. 
Also there is no SelectedIndex for ListView
What platform/framework are you using? WPF? WinForms? ASP.NET? UWP? Other?
also myList[listView.SelectedIndex] does not work as you can't convert that to an int. Basically all I'm trying to do is get the full actual file path of the selected item. However, it keeps giving me errors saying that the path does not exist. That's because it is treating my file as though its coming from the folder where my project is in.
.NET I just need to get the directory path of the selected Item. However, it is showing the directory as coming from the same folder my project is in, which is incorrect.
Windows App. And sorry, I'm new to C# not sure what the difference is.
I followed along because I wanted to do it, but it doesn't have a working product at the end :(. What's the point of an intro video that doesn't have a full hello world example?
By the end of the series, it will be fully functional with different commands. I'm building it like FoxBot's Discord Bot example, using a command handler, which is time consuming , so splitting it into shorter videos will help to explain it better.
In the following video can you explain what a discord bot is and what it is used for?
Moq is good. 
C#/.NET Core support is coming. We're limited by the fact that microsoft chose to make their debugger usable with their own products only. We already have highlighting and intellisense for C#. Refactoring support is coming soon. Even Rider's use of the debugger violates the license.
Opinion: MSTest is painful to write tests for.
neither atm , audio is messy for C# , so it will most likely be the last thing we do
It might be useful in this case if (!int.TryParse(someString, out var i)) { i = someDefaultValue; } // have i accessible here
Check this out homie http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html
Ms test has been around way longer than anything else. 
&gt; x:Key="textblocknamegoeshere" Thanks kindly for the thought. x:Key does not exist, so I tried x:Name and x:UID but that also did not resolve the issue, in fact it causes a different error. This is going to be one of those; "oh duh" issues, I can just feel it. Thanks again 
sorry, x:Key is for resources, the textblock should have x:Name="BlinkyTextBlock" This line should read: Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(aniHour, new PropertyPath("(BlinkyTextBlock.Foreground).(SolidColorBrush.Color)")); I can try re-creating it but not sure what this.Hour refers to.
The dark theme existed in Visual Studio 2013, I'm not sure about 2012 and 2008, though.
XUnit docs are literally shit. They basically don't exist. Also, there's no category attribute like in NUnit or any other framework for any other language. I find them useful especially for lots of tests on the same area of code. NUnits docs aren't the greatest either. 90% of search results returns nunit 2 docs on their website. Sometimes if you're lucky you'll get the v3 docs that are randomly on Github and are hard to navigate. Also, trying to find what is and isn't deprecated from v2 to v3 is far too difficult. Why don't they use the obsolete tag ffs. I'm not keen on moq because its like they decided to see how far they could go turning everything into a lambda. I really really like NSubstitute though. It's straight forward, the docs are good, and it basically has the tagline of "forget the difference between fakes mocks stubs doubles blah blah and just do what you need to do".
Thanks for the info, but I'm still confused. (again, maybe just stupid). If I call this function, I get in return a Task. Like this: var user = GetCurrentUserAsync(); In this case "user" is a Task, but I want the ApplicationUser, how do I get at it? Does this make sense? What is the technique called where the function returns the Task with the &lt;greater than&gt; and &lt;less than&gt; with an object (ApplicationUser) inside? This doesn't seem (to me) to be the async and await or the expression bodies it's ?something else? 
If you're completely new to programming, you could start with a scripting language, such as PowerShell, to get a grasp on the logic and flow of programming. The reason I say PowerShell is that the syntax is pretty close to C#, it's already integrated into all modern Windows operating systems (and now runs on Linux!), there's great free resources on it, and it's a "loosely typed" language, so it's not going to be as strict on the syntax and data types. These videos are a great resource on PowerShell: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D474E721138865A Otherwise, if you're set on learning C# first, the "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding" overview looks like it will be perfect for taking you from 0 to programming in C#.
I wonder where https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection fares
I'm not 100% useless at coding, I can look at code and..understand how the basics work. I've followed a few tutorials, but I couldn't do anything with code. I've probably forgotten how to do " Hello world". I use visual code in Unreal engine 4, and i can get by on that, but I really need to start learning C#. 
HashSet does not implements IList so ElementAt() is an O(k) operation.
The IDE gets installed to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\ Since I installed the community edition, my IDE app is at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe
I'm learning C# for a group project I'm doing in class. We are using c# to build a campus program where a student can put in their class locations and the program will show a visual map of where it is within the campus and how to get to the room. You can try and adapt this idea for something like finding a specific food at a supermarket. 
oh ok, I wasn't familiar with that markup, there seems to be a lot of ways to do the same thing in WPF. I'm assuming from your code that you want a textblock to go from white to red over 29 seconds? Is the background white and this makes it look like it's blinking? Here is a blinking animation I did, maybe it could help you. &lt;TextBlock x:Name="ManualModeTextBlock" Text="Manual Mode" Foreground="Red" FontSize="48" FontWeight="Bold" HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="0,50,0,0"&gt; &lt;TextBlock.Style&gt; &lt;Style TargetType="TextBlock"&gt; &lt;Style.Resources&gt; &lt;Storyboard x:Key="Blink"&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty="Opacity" From="1" To="0" AutoReverse="True" Duration="0:0:1" RepeatBehavior="Forever" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/Style.Resources&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Visibility" Value="Collapsed" /&gt; &lt;Style.Triggers&gt; &lt;DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Content, ElementName=ManualOverrideButton}" Value="Turn System On"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Visibility" Value="Visible" /&gt; &lt;DataTrigger.EnterActions&gt; &lt;BeginStoryboard Name="blinkStoryBoard" Storyboard="{StaticResource Blink}" /&gt; &lt;/DataTrigger.EnterActions&gt; &lt;DataTrigger.ExitActions&gt; &lt;StopStoryboard BeginStoryboardName="blinkStoryBoard" /&gt; &lt;/DataTrigger.ExitActions&gt; &lt;/DataTrigger&gt; &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt; &lt;/Style&gt; &lt;/TextBlock.Style&gt; &lt;/TextBlock&gt; In this example I have text on a form that reads "Manual Mode" in big red letters. There's a trigger binding it to the ManualOverrideButton (just FYI, I would rename your textblock to HourTextBlock so as not to confuse it with a property in your code). If the ManualOverrideButton's content is "Turn System On", the textblock blinks. Not sure if that will help you but thought I would show a different way of doing something.
I have the ide and can open and compile my own code fine. I am unable to compile roslyn (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn), when running restore.cmd I get: E:\Git\roslyn\build\Targets\VSL.Imports.targets(252,3): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v15.0\VSSDK\Microsoft.VsSDK.targets" was not found.

[E:\Git\roslyn\src\Samples\CSharp\ImplementNotifyPropertyChanged\Impl\ImplementNotifyPropertyChangedCS.csproj] and a bunch of others. Looking for the file, the directory `VSSDK` is missing from `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v15.0\` Effectively I am getting this: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/15991 except I am on a fresh clone of master
Probably around March is my goal to finish up there and start on some really good quality C# tutorials with some good productions! Also working on some Oxide stuff which is basically a Unity Mod Development Api that can be used for Rust and 7 Day's To Die
Btw guys I really appreciate the feedback, I know the bot doesn't work, but theres a video on Friday that'll fix it and build the command handler. Also the audio will be fixed in the next few weeks, just so much noise cause I'm using a headset and the filter is pretty bad on it. But if they're's any other technical content you want to see, let me know because I'll try anything
Sending works, and is mostly okay, NAudio will do most of the heavy lifting if you use that, however for a bot FFMpeg would be better. Fox is updating his docs iirc, there's a few pull requests coming in.
Thanks kindly, but this is by changing the opacity, not the Color and it's in XAML, not C# Code-Behind. But again, thank you very much
If your project is small and you are just mocking a couple of objects and asserting isequal at the end of your test, there really won't be too much of a difference. If you are using things like Testcases or categories in Nunit, then you are going to be in a bit more pain with MSTest (Unless something has changed since I last used them). I also find that NUnit's standalone test runner is quite handy when I have a lot of tests to run over VS. 
X=5 Y=x++ // y is 5 and x is now 6 X =5 Z=++x // z and x are now 6
Just a heads up, UE4 uses C++, Unity Engine uses C#. Both are excellent. 
It is possible. I forget the exact syntax because it has been awhile, but there is a way to add an event handler to all uncaught exceptions. In the exception handler you can do anything you would have done in any other part of code and the actual exception that went uncaught is passed to the handler as an exception object. From the exception object you should be able to find out all sorts of information including the message, exception ID, and stack trace. Don't forget to also consider the inner exceptions. Sometimes that relevent information is nested inside an inner exception of a generic framework exception so be sure to report the inner exceptions as well. Sending an email is fairly simple assuming you have a smtp server accessible. If you don't have an smtp server available it is possible to use google as an smtp server (again i forget the exact syntax but a google search should work). ---EDIT--- Here is the syntax to catch unhandled exceptions Application.SetUnhandledExceptionMode(UnhandledExceptionMode.CatchException); AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += new UnhandledExceptionEventHandler(CurrentDomain_UnhandledException); Application.ThreadException += Application_ThreadException; For a project of mine, when an uncaught exception is thrown a Gui appears to the user requesting information about what they were doing at the time of the exception, then takes a screen shot of the application and then emails the whole thing to a mailing list.
You could always try implementing the PQ algorithm, if it's only ever 2-variable equations.
Take a look at [math.net](https://www.mathdotnet.com/), they've got a couple of modules relating to solving equations [such as this one](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/LinearEquations.html). I've not used them myself (only dabbled with other parts of their libraries), but sounds like it might do the job.
I'm also in university so that could be a very applicable program for me to look into! Thanks for the idea!
Thank you very much for this! I am just about to start a new cross-platform project tomorrow, which will be using Xamarin. Hopefully we will be able to draw some value from your work!
I started C# from scratch a few months ago (focusing on Web applications) and had taken a Complete course on asp.NET by Mosh Hamedani. I would suggest taking literally any course by him. He is an outstanding teacher
OK cool, thanks for the input :) 
People like you give me hope for humanity. Thank you.
&gt; that isn't backwards compatible and gives you, at present, no way to convert although they are "working on it" Errr... am I misunderstanding this part of the article? &gt; Project.json/xproj -&gt; csproj Migration &gt; Major improvements have been made to project file migration (project.json/xproj -&gt; csproj). The team fixed many project migration issues to improve the migration experience. &gt; We recommend that you discard previously migrated csproj project files and do a fresh migration from project.json/xproj so that you’ll get the new improvements. You won’t need to follow the manual csproj project file updates described in the section above. On a side note, the `dotnet` command line tool can be used to add Nuget packages now (`dotnet add &lt;PROJECT&gt; package [options] [args]`)
That is talking about migrating .NET Core project files - I was referring to converting the old format for storing NuGet references to the brand new one, as it appears like you can only use one or the other per project (or solution?). Nothing to do with .NET Core.
Using a static `HttpClient` is pretty common, but at least according to the MSDN none of the instance methods are actually guaranteed to be thread safe. You seem to be modifying the static client's default headers in the instance ctor, best guess is that the headers collection is not thread safe and blows up if you modify it on one thread while another one is enumerating it to copy the headers to a new request. If each instance needs the `HttpClient` to send different headers, you need multiple clients anyway. And if the headers are the same for all instances, then modify the code so they're only set once (e.g. in the static ctor).
I think the OP needs a nonlinear solver for a nonlinear system of equations, as opposed to a linear solver. There are 2 variables `X = [ x1, x2 ] `and a system of nonlinear equations `F(X) = 0`. One can either employ any number of multivariate root finding methods or solve an equivalent optimization problem: min 0 s.t. F(X) = 0 If you've taken multivariable Calculus or a numerical methods course, you can easily code up Newton's method by hand, but Math.net has a few root finding algorithms out of the box. (Unfortunately the documentation is not great) https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/api/MathNet.Numerics.RootFinding/index.htm Accord has some optimization algorithms. http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/N_Accord_Math_Optimization.htm **Hint**: the standard form for Newton's method for a multivariable system is as follows: X_`k+1` = X_`k` - J^-1 * F(X_`k`), where J^-1 is the inverse Jacobian. You can derive these equations on paper (the inverse of a 2x2 matrix is easy to calculate), and then implement this in an iterative algorithm. Let me know if you need me to expand on this. **Edit**: I'm assuming your nonlinear system of equations is "well-behaved", i.e. it is continuous and differentiable. If it has weird nonsmooth functions like max(0,x) or "if-else" conditions, you might want to try other "metaheuristic" algorithms like particle swarm or simulated annealing.
I have been watching this guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Voso411Vs videos on Udemy. He has a link in the description of youtube video that makes it $45. I don't know the guy / getting no referral. Coming from an extensive PHP / Perl background these videos were all I needed to get going, so your mileage may vary. They aren't in depth, more like build this app, step 1 I show you, step 2 you repeat as assignment on another part of the app. Easy to go to Google/StackOverflow and get more depth when I want it
I'm curious: what is the PQ algorithm? 
Ah, very well then.
https://github.com/waf/Donatello I'm building a statically-typed Lisp for the CLR. It transpiles to roslyn syntax trees, but it's nowhere close to being fit for public consumption. I'm currently figuring out how to support macros. Basic design is ANTLR Grammar → Roslyn Expression Tree → compiled binary 
[removed]
[Fluent Actions for ASP.NET Core MVC](https://github.com/ExplicitlyImplicit/AspNetCore.Mvc.FluentActions) ([nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExplicitlyImpl.AspNetCore.Mvc.FluentActions)) I'm currently trying to fix full support for async/await by implementing an [IAsyncStateMachine](https://goo.gl/c69Rst), if anyone got experience with that I would love me some feedback.
`throw new Exception("An error occured while resting lol", response.ErrorException);` Might want to improve your error messages ;)
No category attribute? You can make your own by implementing the xUnit ITraitAttribute: [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)] public class CategoryTraitAttribute : Attribute, ITraitAttribute { public string Name { get; set; } public CategoryTraitAttribute(string category) { Name = category; } } I mostly use Moq these days, but I've used NSubstitute too, and the syntax is very, very similar. NSubsitute uses lambdas too, I don't see what's wrong with that, they're not used unnecessarily in Moq anyway. I do agree about xUnit's docs though, they really do suck
At the top of this post, there is a "concepts used" section that shows the prerequisites. Also, on my [Learn C# Page](http://www.jeremyshanks.com/learn-csharp/) you will see that this tutorial is after lesson 3 in the basics section. With that being said I totally get where you are coming from. I have written several tutorials and in the beginning, I was spelling everything out in every one of them but it got really repetitive so I did my best to set up the concepts used section and arrange them in an order that made sense of someone were to want to follow the guides in order. Thanks for the advice, I love getting feedback so that I can improve my tutorials. Some of those questions were not clearly answered so I will go back and do my best to answer them. 
&gt; I'll see that; but it will maybe complicate things if i need to serialize/deserialize everytime. JSON is a defacto standard, which you can still use. But RestSharp is not. Besides with RestSharp the serialization also always happens. Just wrap it in a dedicated class. Not using RestSharp is just something to consider. &gt; Weird, on the c# server, someone recommended me to do that. The "C# server"? There's no such thing. Perhaps you confused something in the statements you got. Take a look at the documentation: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w1htk11d.aspx &gt; Well, I wanted to use TAP ; and RestSharp's "async" is callbacks. which isn't what i wanted (or you say that i can just return using Task.FromResult ? RestSharp supports async queries. Use `ExecuteTaskAsync` instead of `Execute`. But I give you that the RestSharp documentation is very poor. Alternatively, for the future: When you're having an ancient async API that still uses the `IAsyncResult` / `Action&lt;IAsyncResult&gt;` API, then you can use `Task.Factory.FromAsync()` to wrap this in a `Task`. When you have an async API with a regular callback, then you can use the `TaskCompletionSource` instead. Create an instance, return the taks. From the callback you call the `SetResult` method. var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;int&gt;(); SomeMethodThatAcceptsACallback(result =&gt; { tcs.SetResult(result); }); return tcs.Task; 
I was thinking of learning C++ at first, but then a lot of people are saying it's quite difficult for beginners to pick up. Ideally I'd like to be able to use both. How transferable are those skills? 
Yes, I wasn't sure if that's what you were trying to accomplish by making your text go from white to red. If the background is white then it would have the same effect as changing the opacity. Also, I think you could define the storyboard in the Window.Resources section of your page as XAML, give it a key (x:Key) and use code behind to do a begin: ((StoryBoard)FindResource("StoryBoardKey")).Begin(); That way you don't have to depend on a something happening to make it happen. If you do want to use the color you could change the target property to Foreground and the From and To to the colors you want.
You can just create the template yourself, it's just a project archive with a bunch of placeholder tags
I tried making this and ran "Import-Module WebAdministration; Get-ChildItem IIS:\Sites" but it doesn't run because I'm not admin. How would you elevate to admin rights? FTR: I'm admin when I build and run the program. 
I like how you tried to update Appveyor.yml three times and then just deleted it lol
To parse JSON, one can use Simple JSON, which is an embedded dependency via nuget
Aren't they only linear functions? My equations are nonlinear.
Having looked through the other pages, there is indeed a lot of useful information, but that material is by no means accessible for just anybody. It's unclear who your intended audience is however, so my previous statement may be invalid. Is it someone who is new to programming? New to .NET? New to C#? Some of it is somewhat more advanced than should strictly be needed for a 'basic' tutorial in any case, and some of it actually skirts over important principles. I did look at, for example, your page on [streams](http://www.jeremyshanks.com/streams-in-c/). I thought this was nice but it didn't seem to touch on important concepts like disposal and GC in general. You correctly use `Using` but fail to express to the user what it is and why it's important, instead relying upon the user to merely accept it as written. And now take a look at help site like [dotnetperls](https://www.dotnetperls.com/streamreader). It's not terribly well laid out I'll concede, but it covers the points well. Each small step is explained and broken out. Yes, it was probably repetitive for the author, but then if each article is taken as its own body of work, it stands out quite well.
The end goal for my C# roadmap is for someone who is new to programming to fully learn C#. I know I am nowhere close to that (writing tutorials in my free time does not equal tons of content). Originally I was just writing random tutorials and then decided to go with the roadmap with lessons approach. When I put together what I had already written it cause a weird flow and I am trying to work out the kinks. I feel like it is much closer and judging by the fact your feedback is less harsh than other feedback I have gotten I must be moving in the right direction. If you have any suggestions on how I can make this material more accessible for anyone new to programming, that would be great. Thanks again for your feedback.
&gt;I think it should be noted for newcomers that the composition and library choices are extremely opinionated, and certainly not a 'definitive' package for Xamarin. Agreed. Hell, some of my libraries are even superfluous to what Xamarin provides, but they're things I like. I will add that corollary into the readme, though, I think it's a good idea to make that clear.
There is no documentation about the deployment process? Until you figure it out, you could always just build the solution locally and then copy the files across.
Between the two choices, PluralSight. Plus you can get 3 months free through Microsoft's Visual Studio DevEssentials program.
The second code sample is not formatted correctly in reddit so it is hard to read... but it looks like the signature for your form class constructor takes two parameters, a GameLauncher and a GameForm1... you are creating the new parameters object with a constructor that has no parameters provided. There might be a constructor that requires no arguments in the other half of the class definition (It is a "partial" definition in the example) but from the exception I would doubt it exists. You can either create a constructor that takes no arguments or you can provide a GameLauncher and GameForm1 to the existing constructor. 
When you hit "build" in Visual studio it will consolidate all the dlls, config files and binaries into either the bin/debug or bin/release directories. Assuming that you aren't using any libs installed to the GAC these should be all the files required to run your executable. You can copy/pasta this directory/collection of files anywhere and it should be able to run. If you find issues where users are not able to run it, make sure all your third party references are set to copy to output and that you are using the client profile version of the frame work in the application tab of the project options. (If you want to use the version that is not the client profile you just have to ensure that the target user has the .net framework installed on their machine). Another choice is to use click-once publishing. For click-once publishing you will need access to a directory owned by a web server. It will create a manifest and a .application file. You can use internet explorer (Chrome and others don't have the plugins to handle the extension) to navigate to that file which will install it onto the machine. A third choice is to use TFS automated builds and use a publish step in the build definition. 
I just tried on my machine and had no problem with it(i just replaced BigDecimal with ints). Perhaps on the redefinition of * for BigDecimal?
Not sure how much this will help but I found this post that you could try to debugg through put some messages in or something to see what is hit, the comment section looked helpful too. ***Full disclosure I haven't tested this code but just did a bit of searching for self elevating powershell scripts.*** https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/virtual_pc_guy/2010/09/23/a-self-elevating-powershell-script/
I have a yearly subscription from work for free, so not an issue there :)
NSubstitute only use lambda for void returning methods. var cloneable = Substitute.For&lt;ICloneable&gt;(); cloneable.Clone().Returns("Foo");
Just regular async methods. Ideally task based.
Thanks. You mean regular ol' async Task&lt;T&gt; SomeMethodAsync() { ... var result = await somehingAsync(); ... return result; } ?
Just finished the readme. Nice work. Have you tried using this with the VS for Mac Preview?
I know what Roslyn does, I know VS Code works cross platform, I know you can write your own extensions for it... But...I still think this is just so cool.
This is the most basic answer as far as MVC: Do you want to deploy on Windows Server? Use 4.x. Do you want to deploy on Docker/Linux/Windows/whatever? Use Core. Core is the future of MVC, so it's good to learn it now, but as evidenced by the (incredibly stupid) change from project.json to csproj, Core is still a work in progress and many don't think it is production ready. Old comment I made about this subject: &gt;I've been at a mostly Microsoft shop for almost a year now and I have to admit that learning ASP.NET Core has been a surprisingly good experience. I am finishing up my first ASP.NET Core project written and deployed 100% in Linux and it was a pleasure to work with. The only issues I have is that the toolchain in .NET Core still needs some work (The .NET Core devs agree) and the switch from project.json to csproj's retarded XML is infuriatingly stupid.
O boy o boy! Tuples were one of my favorite things of using python. 
From how I understand it, .NET Core is a subset of 4.6 so it can be run cross-platform. You'll lose some functionalities, I've seen WCF/WPF listed as some of those. For ASP.NET you lose the WebForms using .NET Core if I'm not mistaken. 
Can you develop this a bit ? 
Personally... seeing Environment.Exit(); has a similar code smell as seeing Goto &lt;labeL&gt;. The reason I say this is because while it isn't technically wrong, usually the way a program executes is Startup-&gt;Intitalize-&gt;Main Loop-&gt;Cleanup Using Environment.Exit() will cause you to either miss the cleanup step, or to re-write it multiple times or come up with some Environment.Exit() wrapper class that makes it difficult to follow how the program actually cleans up after it's self. Nearly all my console applications start life utilizing a quick and dirty main loop such as bool done=false; while(!done) { &lt;DoStuff&gt; if (&lt;UserRequestsExit&gt;) done=true; } 
* .Net Framework 4.x is the desktop full framework you know and expect. It is comprised of the desktop BCL (mscorelib.dll, System.dll, etc.) and the desktop CLR (C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\clr.dll). The source code for the desktop BCL is available for reference (not an OSS license) here: https://referencesource.microsoft.com/ * .Net Core is a cross platform capable framework developed as OSS consisting of the core foundational libraries, "[corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)" and [Core CLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), where it winds up on your system depends on a number of factors * Asp.Net Core is a set of libraries that target .Net Standard (effectively the set of types shared between .Net Core and 4.x) so it can be used against both CLRs * Asp.Net Core teams decided some time ago that msbuild sucked or something like that and had a fit of NIH where they decided to create the "dotnet CLI" which is loosely a set of tools and a project system for creating projects outside of a msbuild ecosystem. That tooling originally was sufficient for producing Asp.Net Core web applications, but grew to also include libraries and console apps and UWP apps and several other structures (causing it to ultimately require interacting with msbuild anyway). This tooling is now collectively known as the .Net Core Project System. * The EF team is also amidst a platform rewrite known as EF Core. I know little more about it than that. Asp.Net Core is solid and production ready, though it is missing some documentation. .Net Core itself is also generally very ready, as long as you don't need something that is not written in it (including basically everything that is Windows specific, as well as AppDomains, Remoting, CAS and Security Transparency and [a number of apis that are wanted but haven't yet been ported](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aport-to-core)). Many 3rd party libraries (including EF 6) are also not yet updated to support Core due to any number of reasons (though this changes constantly). Fortunately the .Net Core Project system can target both .Net Core and the 4.x framework. Targeting the 4.x framework means you can use any of those 3rd party libraries or the missing stuff from the BCL itself. On the other hand, targeting 4.x limits you to running in a Windows only CLR. Unfortunately there are bugs in the .Net Core Project System and to enable greater integration with existing platforms as well as fix these, there are changes coming as part of VS2017 to switch to an MsBuild compatible system, including going back to the .csproj file type. tldr: * .Net 4.x - closed source available (reference license), windows only framework * .Net Core - open source (MIT), cross platform framework * Asp.Net Core - library for building web apps, missing some docs, you should use it anyway * "project.json" - fiasco; works mostly unless you hit a bug; returning to .csproj in 2017, aka part of .Net Core Project System; worth putting up with for Asp.Net Core (you might even like it) **Asp.Net Core is the future of Asp.Net MVC.** It is completely disconnected from any particular framework.
Oh that is just the factorization equation for a univariate quadratic polynomial. I didn't know it had a name. Unfortunately I don't believe this will work. The OP mentioned nonlinear equations, which may not necessarily be quadratic. In fact they may not even necessarily be polynomial. Also that factorization is univariate and does not generalize to the multivariable case. It isn't possible to solve simultaneous equations with that. 
1) nvarchar(max) is treated differently that nvarchar(n). The differences are not apparent to the developer and occur entirely within the sql server operations. The table is more likely to contain a pointer to the data rather than the data it's self (causing a slight slowdown). I am fairly certain the indexing nvarchar(max) is less effective than indexing nvarchar(n). It can affect your sql query plan due to the sql engine having less concrete information regarding the column. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148398/are-there-any-disadvantages-to-always-using-nvarcharmax 2) "A list of Something" usually indicates a 1 to many or a many to many relationship between two distinct objects. The "Somethings" are more than likely independent objects from the thing that has a list of them. Therefore, you wouldn't want to cram all that data into the same table. Example, lets say you have a contact object, the contact object can have multiple phone numbers. You would have one table Contacts ID|FirstName|LastName -|-|- 1|John |Doe 2|Ineeda |Hugg and a second table PhoneNumbers ID|ContactID|Title|Number -|-|-|- 1| 1|Home| (121) 222-3333 2| 1|Work| (212) 333-2222 3| 2|Home| (333) 123-4567 4| 2|Work| (555) 999-9999 5| 2|Toll Free| 1 (800) 321-1234 You would get all of a particular contacts phone numbers with a join statement Select c.FirstName, c.LastName, p.Title, p.Number from Contacts c join PhonenNumbers p on c.ID=p.ContactID where c.ID=@contactID so, having @contactId=2 returns FirstName|LastName|Title|Number -|-|-|- Ineeda |Hugg |Home|(333) 123-4567 Ineeda |Hugg |Work|(555) 999-9999 Ineeda |Hugg |Toll Free| 1(800) 321-1234 Then *just to be safe* you can create a foreign key restraint on the phone numbers table to ensure that the value in ContactID column of the phone numbers table is contained in the ID column of the Contacts table. 
I downloaded the source code and it resolved `SemaphoreSlim` and compiled fine for me on VS2015. Compiled for both .NET 4.0 and 4.6.1 (I don't have 4.6.4 Preview). I'd recommend first trying an earlier non-Preview version of the framework and see if that works. Otherwise, not too sure. Do you have a `using System.Threading;` directive at the top of the file(s)?
Thanks for this, it's working now. I was hitting "publish". Do you recommend any books to read on this topic?
I think I was trying to run a file under a publish directory. When I clicked build and then found the bin/debug directory it works.
The first thing that pops out to me is that the error I would expect to see is "The type of namespace 'semaphore' could not be found... a whitespace is not allowed in a fully qualified type name.... so calling type 'Semaphore Slim' in the exception is unexpected. You shouldn't have to add a reference because the semephore is a type defined in the system.threading namespace in system.dll which is automatically referenced when you create the solution. Check to ensure you have a reference to System (Although if you didn't you would have larger problems than this). Ensure you have Using System.Threading; in the header or that you use the fully qualified type System.Threading.Semaphore in the declaration. Did you copy/past this line? Double check that the white space between Semaphore and Slim is an actual white space rather than some other character that just gets rendered as a white space. 
I totally agree
Scroll jacking? Not interested.
Did you just have a stroke or what? 
That would be super cool. The x86/x64 code is contingent on JITting, though, and doesn't necessarily have one single output at runtime (eg, in the case of generic methods/types) - so it might be complicated.
That was an awful lot of word salad. I cant even come up with a tl;dr even though I read the whole thing. 
Platform is an easy toggle, but yea generics would be a pain.
Is this in a console project? If so, make a WPF project and put the code there instead.
What's the JSON, what's the model?
Thank you very much.
I kindda figured it out, but not exactly sure as to why yet :P I'm running visual studio 2015 and .NET was 4.6.1, target cpu was Any, I'm on a 64 bit machine and visual studio is run as administrator. So I figured out how to get error from this by script.streams.error, and google gave me some clues that some had been experiencing x86 gotcha. So instead of target cpu any I changed it to x64. And it is working. But it is interesting because I tested both x86 powershell and x64 powershell on my machine and both accepted the powershell command. Thanks for your reply though, self elevating powershell seems to be a neat trick!
Community is free as well
&gt; I wonder who is in charge of naming and versioning over there! Naming is a marketing thing. Versioning is a technical thing. Don't confuse the two.
&gt; The end goal for my C# roadmap is for someone who is new to programming to fully learn C#. I know I am nowhere close to that (writing tutorials in my free time does not equal tons of content). I think that the hardest task is going to be imparting the most basic principles of software engineering to a lay person. To give you a little background about me, I fell into software engineering purely by accident. I was messing around with a game and wanted to understand things behind the scenes so that I could cheat. I ended up digging around in the memory and found that I could see structures in hexadecimal quite well, and that I could translate this into writing a memory editor. I came across a group of developers who were working on the same thing and I was able to help point out the structures in memory and what they related to in-game. After that, I wanted to learn more about coding and decided to read some books. The books were frankly terrible but other people regarded them quite highly. Some people learn from reading, but I learn from ripping things apart and seeing how they work. It wasn't until I came across a simple Java implementation of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) that it really clicked. Objects, classes, inheritance, the whole caboodle just suddenly fell into place. My rather elongated point is that it's going to be **very** difficult to anticipate what will make that 'click' connection with a novice because everyone is different, and they learn concepts at a different pace. I've often seen that they need to be given concrete, real-world examples dropped into code before they can visualise code. When I was learning, it was video stores and libraries, but they're increasingly obscure terms, but a simple shop can work just as well. I feel that, the more examples of simple, real-world ideas and concepts that you can plug into your articles, the better.
You have to make more than 1 million USD or have more than 10 developers. If you use it for open source it's free regardless. Completely reasonable of you ask me.
XML is not a very nice format at all. I don't really see why microsoft chooses to standardize on it.
Because it's often associated with bad luck: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_(number)#Unlucky_13 Interestingly the SQL Server 2016 has the version number 13.
&gt; Personally... seeing Environment.Exit(); has a similar code smell as seeing Goto &lt;labeL&gt;. At least they didn't use Environment.FailFast() :p. The .NET framework does that here and there, including some places where it seems very overkill.
&gt; Exiting from Main is how you close a console application cleanly. Using Environment.Exit is another way to close cleanly, although I wouldn't normally recommend it myself.
It's only free under the following conditions: - Up to 5 devs that use VS. - Up to 250 computers within the company (not only developers, but in total). - Up to 1m US$ revenue (not earnings) per year.
.Net Core is open source and free to use, the compiler for C# is open source and free to use, msbuild is open source and free to use, etc. Pretty much everything is open source and free now but visual studio which you don't require to build C# apps. It just helps a lot.
Seems pretty tame for the company that released OSes named "Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs" and "Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition"
WFLP was actually a rather interesting configuration. Be it that it had no features, and no support for anything, it was a good terminal preparation.
Yeah, this really fscks things up in my day job, when trying to discern which version of the .NET Framework is being used in a remote blackbox test, given only the major, minor, and release numbers as a response HTTP header from IIS / ASP.NET. Without the exact build number you have no clue for the mostpart.
We use some example code from Microsoft that queries the WMI database about it.
/u/eightvo post will be the gist of it.
Yes, dotnet core absolutly free, you can install it from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core Also you can use another IDE or text redactor (VS Code, Rider for example).
Ah, sorry I didn't got that.
Looks like a delegate, but IList&lt;T&gt;.Find() seems to take a Predicate&lt;T&gt;, which is just a function that takes a T and returns true or false. Where is this coming from?
Removed: Spam. Also, there are incorrect/ambiguous answers, inconsistencies, and no indication when you are expected to pick multiple answers or just one. You should also have an indication of how many questions or what your progress through the quiz is.
And the most popular version of Visual Studio would probably be Visual Studio 6 due to the legacy VB6 applications that you have to maintain even today.
Considering it was a light version of XP... Many other OSes prior to that were managable via a centralized system. Even 3.11 had options to do so.
There is also a Visual Studio for Mac. Its in preview but is also free. https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/ 
Have mixed feelings about the killing of VB6. It forced me to learn C#, which I love so much. But VB6 was really powerful. I look at Dependency Injection today and can't help but think *"So basically just global variables that we had in VB back in 1995"*
I think you need to use the entity you got from the db in the later calls. If your posted model has a bunch of null, SetValues might remove stuff that you want to keep. db.Entry(currentAsset).CurrentValues.SetValues(asset); db.Entry(currentAsset ).State = EntityState.Modified;
Heres some pseudo code. I apologize for lack of indentation and also for not the best comments/explanation - im doing this on my phone. When im on a computer next, i can edit this and explain a little more if you need me too! //energy that we're expecting to spend float energyToSpend = someEnergy; //the amount of E we've spent so far float energySpent = 0f; //the number of times we've iterated so far int iterationCount = 0; //iterate over every generator foreach (var gen in Generators){ //the total E left over that we need to spend float netCost = (energyToSpend - energySpent); //the number of gens we havent iterated through yet int numOfGeneratorsLeft = Generators.Count - iterationCount; //the E cost that the currently iterated gen is expected to spend float currentCost = netCost / numOfGeneratorsLeft; //this gen doesnt have enough... if (gen.energy &lt; currentCost) { //because we use energySpent to determine currentCost, //this will evenly spread out the amount of E the //generators left over have to spend energySpent += gen.energy; gen.energy = 0; } //this gen has enough energy else { energySpent += currentCost; gen.energy -= currentCost; } iterationCount++; }
95, and 98 also had group policy. The reason for FLP was to make use of older PCs for remote desktop terminals. All were manageable in a "sane" way, if you knew what you were doing.
Jon Skeet answered (and asked) a similar question that isn't quite as up to date as this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/247623/3093703
This method can be modified slightly to create a function that checks to see if the generators can even support the expected cost. To be a bit more specific: this iteration technique is exactly to the specification that the OP posted in one of his comments on this post, he can modify some parts in order to check if its a valid action before hand too.
truu I got it to work! i actually did some debugging and had to change another line, the one in the second for loop. Instead of having it like asset.Licenses.Add(license); I changed to currentAsset.Licenses.Add(license); bc even though for some reason we saved it to the asset object, when we do that line you had with the CurrentValues.SetValues it didn't update the licenses field and in fact, said there were none. that line also helped to save the other fields if we were updating those as well. I think my problem was, I was confused this whole time. i thought the Asset asset was referring to the asset passed in that we were editing but it is in fact not, and it's just binding those properties in a brand NEW asset object. ahaaaa lol didn't know that. thanks for the help! [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult Edit([Bind(Include = "AssetID,Description,PersonID,ManufacturerID,Serial,RegionID,Cost,Notes,StatusID,DatePurchased,DateAdded,AssetTypeID,stamp")] Asset asset, int[] Licenses) { if (ModelState.IsValid) { Asset currentAsset = db.Assets.Find(asset.AssetID); ICollection&lt;License&gt; currentLicenses = currentAsset.Licenses.ToList(); //db.Assets.Attach(asset); if (Licenses != null) { foreach(var temp in currentLicenses.ToList()) { if(Licenses.Contains(temp.LicenseID) == false) { currentAsset.Licenses.Remove(temp); } } foreach (var LicenseID in Licenses) { License license = db.Licenses.Find(LicenseID); currentAsset.Licenses.Add(license); } } db.Entry(currentAsset).CurrentValues.SetValues(asset); db.Entry(currentAsset).State = EntityState.Modified; db.SaveChanges(); return RedirectToAction("Index"); } return View(asset); }
My code shipped in Whidbey and Orcas and I integrated SSDT and bunch of SQL server bits into Dev10. :)
Is that how .NET 3.0 had .NET 2.0 as a subcomponent? That continues to baffle me.
A generator usually means it spawns or increments continuously. I would suggest that you create a resource pool that gets fed by your generators. Then you can limit spending with a max capacity, but still allow a "burn down" strategy. Ie, gens give +5 every sec, but a player can stock up a bit to use a 10/sec ability. If you want each generator to have it's own pool of energy. You will want to distribute costs based on how much they hold currently. Note: A high gen... could be out of energy, which would cause issues in some distribution models. You can also try a regen based pay system to immulate an on going buildup cost. Which would simply use a distribution of active regen and either spread costs equally, by weighted distrubution, or location. Perhaps a combination, pending the feel of the game.
No, that's completely unrelated. .NET 3.0 is just an in-place replacement of .NET 2.0. Same as .NET 4.5 is an in-place replacement of 4.0. With 3.0 and 4.0 they had breaking changes.
If the user has permissions to copy/move/delete files, does it matter if they do it in the file dialog rather than opening a windows explorer to do it? What are you trying to accomplish? 
For reasons outside of my control I have to let a user....... browse to a select a file but ensure that they are not able to do any type of file copy/edit/delete. It is a bit backwards but thats just the way its been setup. Even if they can this OUTSIDE of this specific window. We want to disable it.
It seems that they do it all the damn time. Look at the naming mess they did with netcore
Ahh, you're right. I misread the code. I think what you have here will work just fine. It has a behaviour where potentially smaller generators will be used up to capacity and medium/larger generators won't be, but that can be OK. One issue might be to make sure that when iterating on the generators, you might want to make sure they're sorted from smallest to largest generator. Otherwise it may not pull enough energy from the larger generators.
mildly relevant and makes me giggle is [2ndIterationControverialMSJavaProduct 2.0 Second Edition.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15468)
Dumb question, isn't `Predicate&lt;T&gt;` just a fancy way of saying a lambda expression that returns a `bool`?
They even have package manager repos set up for some of the major Linux distributions. Although you do have to click "Current" to get the .NET Core 1.1 directions instead of 1.0.x (currently 1.0.3).
Sure, in my previous job I used MySQL on a frequent basis (for relational CRM databases) So you think a Mailclient integration would be a good first project? Many thanks, Elliot
There's not really any value in having two references to the same object in the same scope in which it was created. Reference type semantics are primarily a performance enhancement. Large value types are expensive to pass around, while a large reference type takes just as much time to pass as a tiny one.
As someone who didn't use VB, how are global variables similar to dependency injection?
I'm surprised you didn't toss the .NET Standard versions in there with the version of C# they apply to. In this list, "vNext" stands for the next releases of these products * .NET Standard 1.0 is: * Windows Phone Silverlight 8.0 * .NET Standard 1.1 is * .NET Framework 4.5 * Windows Phone 8.0 * .NET Standard 1.2 is * .NET Framework 4.5.1 * Windows Phone 8.1 * .NET Standard 1.3 is * .NET Framework 4.6 * .NET Standard 1.4 is * .NET Framework 4.6.1 * Universal Windows Platform (UWP) * .NET Standard 1.5 is * .NET Framework 4.6.2 * .NET Standard 1.6 is * .NET Framework vNext * .NET Core 1.x * .NET Standard 2.0 (Not yet released) is * .NET Framework 4.6.1 (I'll explain this in a minute) * .NET Core vNext (which has since been revealed to be .NET Core 2.0) * Xamarin.iOS vNext * Xamarin.Android vNext * Xamarin.Mac vNext .NET Standard 2.0 is intentionally dropping back to .NET Framework 4.6.1 as it is the most widely supported version. This release is mainly bringing a bunch of APIs that were formerly .NET Framework only into .NET Standard. It also introduces a compatibility layer to load older .NET Framework DLLs on Xamarin and .NET Core.
&gt; I suppose it is still possible that the name changes again to Visual Studio 2018... Not quite, MS release software (mostly VS) with year numbers in it either half way through the year or just before the end of the year, so they will be releasing 2017 this year but maybe September. People always rage and downvote me for that one, but here goes: * Windows 95: August 24, 1995 * Windows 98: June 25, 1998 * Visual Studio 2005: November 7, 2005 * Visual Studio 2008: November 19, 2007 * Visual Studio 2012: Can't find year on Google * Visual Studio 2013: November 13, 2013 * Visual Studio 2015: June 20th * Visual Studio 2017: I don't see why it will be any earlier than Q3 at the earliest
https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#add-pinned-channel-message I don't know much about the Dicord.Net project but they use to have it [here](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net/blob/5049e573b3f696170ac5ce85695c00e7c60f9b5c/src/Discord.Net/API/DiscordRestApiClient.cs#L345) It's an open source project, it doesn't seem to hard to go and add a command for it.
I totally agree, if it is released this year it will be Q3 or Q4. Just saying it is possible they decide no 2017 release and delay until 2018(and name it to reflect this). I haven't seen a commitment to 2017 aside from the name.

Yea, tell that to the idiots who keep writing `container.Resolve&lt;IFooService&gt;()` all over the place.
It is effectively the same when DI is done incorrectly and IoC containers are passed around.
 &gt;Visual Studio 6 was for ASP/VBScript. Huh? That's not true at all. Visual Studio 6 was the *collection* of all the visual tools. It included Visual C++, VB 6, Visual InterDev and Visual J++. Honestly I don't remember Visual Studio 6 Enterprise ever having an IDE for Classical ASP/VBScript..Maybe that was interdev. I forget what that did. 
I don't know about C++, but Visual InterDev and Visual J++ ran on the VS 6 shell.
No need to downvote. I am telling you what Visual Studio was. It was a collection of development tools. They were all seperate IDEs.. Oh yeah it also had Visual Fox Pro. I mean [here is a picture](http://imgur.com/J1ZYk3L) of the freaking box for professional edition..
You need to be looking for object oriented concepts instead of C# specific. Every issue you've brought up is something that exists in, say, C++. cplusplus.com is a great resource for that stuff. Also, I don't want to say you can't learn C# or C++ as a first programming language, but it can definitely be difficult. I still think something like Python takes the cake for first language. Then again, mine was VB6, so I'm forever broken because of that
Im a total noob on programming. The language that i know most is Python but i dont remember a lot. Im on vacation from school for a while, so im trying to learn up. Is C++ a good begginer language, i heard is complex and hard or something?
C++ is way too complex for a first language in my opinion. You certainly can do it, but there are a lot of common pitfalls you'll run into.
C# is a much better choice for a first language. I don't think you need to start with something simpler like Python, but I wouldn't recommend c++. Even pure C would be a better choice.
You definitely don't have to learn any other language to learn c#. Have you tried looking for beginner books? That's how I learned back in the day. Are you specifically looking for free ways to learn?A quick google search turn up Microsoft Virtual Academy: https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/programming-in-c-jump-start-14254?l=MqbQvzSfB_1500115888 It seems to be oriented for beginners. If you're willing to pay then I'd recommend a [book](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=c%23+for+beginners&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ac%23+for+beginners) or one of paid online sites like Pluralsight: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-fundamentals-csharp The best way to learn is to start with a beginner course or book that goes over the basic concepts of programming and then applies them to c#. 
While I use Visual Studio, I've heard some people also recommend the completely-free Atom editor: https://atom.io/
Don't forget about [Netduino](http://www.netduino.com/) and NETMF! Also [IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot)! (but .Net Core on tiny computers is cool too).
Hey! congrats on learning programming. C# was actually the language I first learned when I was a teenager. Programming has just a lot of concepts, most of them are not very complex, but the sheer amount can make it hard to get started. Just keep at it even if you have some false starts. First some resources https://www.dotnetperls.com/ - lots of awesome overviews of basic concepts in C# and the .NET framework. http://stackoverflow.com/ - a question and answer site, if you have a question this is the first place to look, very likely the answer is already there Ok and finally your questions: Member functions are just functions associated with a particular class. A Class define a type of object. An object is what gets "instantiated" by a class. Think of a class as defining the idea of a thing, and all its properties and behaviors. And an object as being an actual instance of that thing. So you could have a design for a car, which would be the class, and then have a bunch of actual cars built from that design all with different current states, but the same properties and behaviors. check out https://www.dotnetperls.com/class and https://www.dotnetperls.com/object void just means that the function it describes does not return any value to its caller. The purpose of using it is to tell the compiler that you dont expect to return anything so its not an error if you fail to do so. see https://www.dotnetperls.com/void using allows you to shorten the names of things defined externally to the current file. Or it helps manage the lifecycle of disposable objects .Meaning objects that have resources associated with them that you want to make sure you release. Resources are things like network connections that you want to make sure you close. see https://www.dotnetperls.com/using and https://www.dotnetperls.com/system
&gt; Could you expand a little on what was the project.json fiasco? A json-like format would be alright, if it was actually an improvement. The project.json file's only improvement was that it didn't have as much boilerplate extra text. Unfortunately it came at a cost: * It was a very strict json document, no mixing quotes, no comments, no barewords, no trailing commas * The json language support in VS is meh... It works, but it doesn't recover well from errors such as `=` instead of `:`, an extra `"`, a missing `,` and so on. * project.json libraries could not be used as project references in csproj based projects or vbproj based projects or vcproj or fsproj or so on nor could they be in reverse Each of these are fixable, but the result is now that VS tooling needs to be aware and support both formats. And still the only real improvements are in removing the bloat that is the XML structure and trading a little some boilerplate with slightly fewer magic strings. &gt; Also, has it been formally announced that in the future ASP.NET Core will replace the existing ASP.NET? As formal as Channel 9 videos of various MS employees can be. I haven't seen an msdn link or anything that specifically says so. But it will not replace the existing Asp.Net. It is the next version of Asp.Net MVC and Web Api (WebForms will continue to be supported in the full framework and may receive further upgrades there [stuff like language enhancements and security APIs at least I assume], I don't remember exactly what was said or which video it was). [The introduction doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) specifically calls it "a significant redesign of ASP.NET."
I think you should check the [C# for absolute beginners course.](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169)
I recommend you to start learning with something less mainstream like Pascal or Basic. Its ideal language to learn programming. Then i suggest to learn how stuff works with plain C and Assembler. After that you can work your way up reading books about algorithms, oop, compilators and at the same you already can program in language of your choosing like C# or Python. I don't recommend learn Python or C# as first language because you will miss out a lot of important concepts.
In this snippet doesn't like.promote() take action on the same object that visited references? If so then won't liked always equal promote?
Pluralsight is really the way to go.
Thank you.
And here's the photo if you just buy VB: http://img.dooyoo.co.uk/GB_EN/orig/0/0/1/4/8/14860.jpg Visual Studio 2012 comes with Expression Blend. That doesn't mean Expression Blend is Visual Studio. 
Damned if I know, but it was really common a few years ago. Hopefully people don't do that any more, but I haven't looked around lately. 
Congrats! Your choice to learn to code will greatly impact any career you choose, and greatly increase what you can do for hobbies. The 3D game making tool called Unity3D uses C#. I teach it to high school students and I've made [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRf-PfhVvwFDWrHVWYj9tiRze0rtB5Sn0) of simple and short videos. I have a feeling you could use seeing some basic examples of some of these concepts.
Yeah it's fucking terrible. How can someone have "learnt" about DI and not have learnt that the service locator pattern is anti pattern. For starters, it is very ironic. You are replacing a strong coupling on a dependency, with a full on dependency on the container! I've also started to come across what I can only describe as service locator in disguise but mixed in with some other weird ideas. Autofac supports a "IocType" tag, the idea being you can put that on the class you need to inject dependencies. I've no idea why they thought that was a good idea to implement but well done, people now scatter that across their code base and yet again couple themselves to a specific container. Makes me twitch.
With the .NET framework c# has a lot of stuff built in. This takes time to learn but also hides a lot of the complexity of certain tasks. Because of this I believe it's a great first language. It will allow you to create functionality quickly while still giving you all the power. .Sign up for an account in the same place you downloaded Visual Studio. They will have a section for learning. I believe they give you something like 30 hours of PluralSight for free, which I've been told is one the best resources. Good luck!
Just as I thought, thanks
I would recommend [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas) on youtube for all beginner programming stuff. He has loads of videos on many different languages and object oriented programming concepts. To answer your questions: Member functions/variables are just normal functions/variables but are contained within a class. they are usually "private" so other classes cannot access them. Look up encapsulation. When you write a class it is a blueprint for an object. You cannot normally use that class directly with out instantiating it. Say you had a Car class, to use it you would need to instantiating using new e.g. Car myCar = new car(); Void means that a function doesn't return a value. Have a look at function return types. Using is importing libraries of code (think prebuilt functions) e.g. using System.Collections.Generic; allows you to use lists and other fun data collections. Hope this help and good luck.
Don't be scared, it's easy to get lost with languages that have many features. You should know that a function in C# can be passed around like pretty much any variable can. I would probably start here by using VS to find the definition of the IRepositoryQuery type, and look at classes that implement it and see what they want in their constructors. That should help you figure out how to use the method.
In the Car MyCar = new car(); example, what exactly does this line of code do?
Depends what the format of the nodes will be. Possibly, add a key-value pair set. Certainly don't add a free text node though, no matter how easy that seems as it just defeats the point of the XML in the first place. Possibly look into XML schema namespace versioning, then allow imports from a variety of schema namespaces. e.g. https://www.subbu.org/blog/2005/03/versioning-xml-schemas
Only if the most liked and most visited page are the same.
Hopefully Pi0 will get bumped from armv6 at some point... (pretty please Eben ? $10 ? $15?? Please ?!?!?) Love the Pi0 form factor and to be able to ditch the ancient mono 3.something for core would be spiffy :D Keeping my fingers crossed for this or a near-equivalent !
You create a class that describes what an object can do. You then use the that line of code above to actually be able to use it. 
A member variable is a normal variable, but the term member distinguishes it's scope. A member variable is at class instance level scope. I suppose a "normal" variable would be at function level scope. a member function is also just a normal function but at the class instance level. A class has two parts to it in a sense... the definition and the instance. When you write a class in code public class myClass{ public myClass(){} } It's great that you have a class definition... but you don't have any instances of the class until you do something like myClass var=new myClass(); That line Instantiated a new instance of the myClass object. void sort of means null... for instance, all functions are required to have a return type. If your function is actually a method and doesn't return anything then you have to define it as public void myfunction(){} using has a couple uses depending on context. In the header of the file you'll see Using System; or Using System.Threading; This is just a way to short hand fully qualified typenames. So, no matter the case the assembly that contains the type must be referenced... but if you try to instantiate an object from a different namespace then you would have to provide the fully qualified type name if you don't put a using statement to import that namespace. For example, if you want to write to the console you **Could** write System.Console.WriteLine("ABC"); But since by default the Using System; directive is there we only have to use Console.WriteLine("ABC"); You can use the using statement to make an alias typename. (Generally I avoid this as it can go either way as to making the code more legible or not. It usually makes the particular code file being worked on more legible... but if that type needs referenced elsewhere it can get weird) Example If you add using map = Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;&gt;; to the header then in your code Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; m1=new Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;&gt;(); if functionally equivalent to map m1=new map(); There is also the use of using as a keyword where an object that implements IDisposable can be "used" to ensure that when it exits scope Dispose is called on the object.. using (System.IO.StreamReader rdr = new System.IO.StreamReader("file")) { } as soon as the scope escapes the using(){} statement dispose will be called on the StreamReader rdr because StreamReaders implement IDisposable 
I have not yet, just Xamarin Studio for Mac.
VB should be renamed B#. And powershell renamed P# Sql renamed Q# or S# (Query Sharp) Razor to R# Just sharpen up everything... :)

Google's entire front end infrastructure for sites like Youtube is built using Python. For high scale performance reasons they're starting to experiment with an in-house compiler, but it's still Python. If it was truly garbage, I think they would have dropped that a long time ago
Also side note... I've used EF a ton and am even using it right now in a project I just started for a client: look into Dapper (if you haven't already). Dapper is a freaking AWESOME mini-ORM that also happens to be almost as fast as hand-coded SqlDataReader (presuming you coded a nice, fast class that leveraged SqlDataReader for your purposes). It also happens to be maintained/created by StackOverflow and is what they use to send queries to their database, which is technically 1 big ass SQL server that processes _everything_ (there is a backup, caching, etc etc obviously as well). The only thing I can think is the kind of "added step" of writing a class &amp; interface that does the queries (even for basic CRUD), but I rather like the level of control that this gives me as well. See: https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net and https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/ for all the details.
Atom and Omnisharp umfortunatly don't go together as of Atom version 1.9 I think.
I still don't understand why that happens. I have read and understand that if you affect a control via animation you cannot later affect it directly. Something to do with where the object resides in the stack... but that's above my knowledge base. So this works... but I don't know why it was such a problem in the first place. Odd.
Well, some of the content presented in the Original Post is made by Microsoft. If you by "Microsoft's own learning material" you mean their documentation, I considered it but I decided not to go with that, because I found out that I learn better when concepts are presented to me and I google myself the documentation for what I don't understand, instead of just having a book, or alot of documentation and not knowing what to do with it.
Do they have projects or assignments?
Try adding the "Edit References" and add them.
I highly, highly, highly recommend you start at a much lower level language. While your ambition is admirable you're going to end up skipping over several important concepts that .NET makes easy. But hey... to each his own.
I interpret it as number of computers in the enterprise. 
I can't find anything on that link suggesting that 64-bit apps are limited to 2gb.
Looks like your link is correct and I am wrong, it does allocate over 2 gb in 64 bit mode, so I can only assumne the author compiled it as any cpu. However if you compile it any cpu and run it on a 64 bit manchine it does hit the limit, so it must limit the jit even when running 64 bit mode
You can convert it to a byte array and send it that way. Maybe even create a file transfer class with additional information about the byte array you're sending. Google "image to byte array". Sorry for being vague, I'm currently on mobile. 
If you want it as plain-text, use [Base64](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.convert.tobase64string\(v=vs.110\).aspx). [You can also stream the file](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9549889)
How are you allocating it though, making a giant list? That will hit its own max size.
I started with Bob Tabor's videos and did some Pluralsite but this YouTube playlist really helped me. He also has other stuff that will help (like SQL, MVC, etc.) The only downside..a bit of an accent. c# tutorial for beginners: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105
They have several in Azure [Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/storage/tables/), [DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/documentdb/)
The MVA C# Fundamentals course doesn't have any assignments. Mostly you just copy what he does onscreen while he explains everything. All lessons are videos, no reading material. Its a good short course to get the very basics. The edX course is more in depth. More reading along with videos. You have to buy the book that goes along with the course to be able to do practice problems. They will not actually give you practice problems but only refer you to pages in the book that contain them. They do give you one assignment at the end of each module that is not based on the book along with a couple questions to answer.
This is why my shop has no plans to embrace core until 2.0. It's too cutting edge atm. 
I have a program I made in dotnet that deals with large images, and I've had no problems using 10GB of RAM without anything special besides targeting x64.
I always build blackjack. The rules are simple but there's some nuances. I currently am working with Akka and using Mediatr as well. Basically some DDD stuff. with a vue frontend. Totally over engineered, but it's what I do for all languages I learn. 
Honestly, at this point, I would pick a project and just start making it! You likely have enough under your belt now to actually produce a real program. And you will learn _so many_ new things just by going through that start-to-finish process of making a real project. More hard/real lessons than any next book could teach you, at least.

Okay, thanks for the tip !
I can think of 2 choices. - API response returns the file directly. Staatstrojaner already gave the answer for this - API response returns a JSON response with a hyperlink to the image, that the client then downloads. This tends to be easier for the client to deal with. Then you just need to expose the images in a static directory. Downside of this is that there are 2 requests, but that usually isn't a big deal. This is how e.g. the Flickr API works. Not sure which solution is better for you. I would tend to go with the second option.
Look for something interesting on http://up-for-grabs.net/ That's a list of open source GitHub projects that need help with issues. The issues tend to be easy for someone outside the project to do.
JSON is worse. At least with XML you can add comments, which is really important when talking about build scripts. 
http://up-for-grabs.net/ &gt; This is a list of projects which have curated tasks specifically for new contributors. These are a great way to get started with a project
I've built a tool for downloading content from Reddit that meant to be consumed/used offline or at a later time. This solved a problem of mine wherein some links posted to Reddit were no longer available when I had the time to visit the links. So I needed a way to quickly download the content so that I can consume/use it at a later time. I got several thousand users now from /r/opendirectories and /r/datahoarder. I've also added support for downloading from other subreddits such as /r/wallpapers, /r/pics, /r/fullmoviesonyoutube and many more. The software is [here](http://www.moonstarsky.com). This is a commercial product by the way. PM me if you want a free license.

That's probably because paging. On virtual memory access a physical page isn't present so the os must fetch the page via disk io. But oom doesn't necessarily have to be preceded by slowness eg in the no paging case.
there is no limit as such, you're mainly limited by your processing power / memory, as well as politeness. Please look up politeness and robots.txt usage.
I'm really open to anything right now
Thanks. I would look into it
If you are using it to contribute to open source projects that is fine.
Started in 2011 :P
Wow. Sounds like something I'll be interested in. Only problem is i don't know how to begin a project of this scale. If you could give me some pointers, it will be greatly appreciated.
Do you have a github account? Do you like a challenge? Created a new organization and imported a simple tree project https://github.com/dotnetcorestudy/tree I can add you as an organization member and you can make changes as you see fit with the code. Maybe even make it so it runs on .NET core! PM me if you'd like. 
Oh I started in 2010, this is where the internet and the physical world had a crossover episode.
Pick something interesting that hits all of the key technologies in the stack. Store some data in a db, manipulate it in some way in some kind of middle tier (ie. don't do straight crud), serve it up with a useful API (library or service, up to you) and plop a front end on it (web, desktop, app, mobile, or all of the above is up to you). Personally when I started out, for whatever reason, I made a point-of-sale system in every new language I learned. Not sure why. It was a fun problem for my mind to work on. I included - the actual point of sale, entering/scanning barcodes (barcode scanners generally just input a text string and are little different from a keyboard from the app's perspective) - sales reports - inventory and such Again, I don't know why; I was a weird kid.
Gonna need a bit more code. This is nothing more than a pinvoke signature and then some values that we don't get to see. How are you setting up your values to pass and how are you checking for errors?
aahh It turns out that I was running the method in a Task.Run which meant for some reason when I checked the lastwin32 error afterwards it wasn't set... is it thread specific??
http://pastebin.com/zj4Dptim So here it is with a bit more context - The reason it is async and in a Task, is I'm, in short, creating a small ui program that moves a file from one place to another with a progress bar.. to get it all the work I need to make the method async and await running that method in a Task otherwise it locked up the UI
Thank you! that has really helped :)
Made some changes and captured that error code in that new thread and returned it back to the calling thread and from there I've thrown the exception which is making everything work nicely, really appreciate the help
Ah yes it does... I feel rather silly now 
Static variables are the same for all instances of the class, so I generally use them like global variables that are associated with the object they are declared on. Other developers might do things differently though. As a real world example, in web development i like to use a static getter to get an instance of the current session.
Nothing should be static, except for extension methods and operator overloading which can only be static. 
Removed: Rule 4. Unfortunately, the question is too broad as it is and open for personal opinion. It's also a fairly rudimentary C# concept. Perhaps you can repost a question with a more concrete or specific context.
Can't remember exactly but exactly but Rob Miles recommended "Code Complete" not necessarily for "Know more about c#" it's more like "How to become a better programmer in general".
Yes, I know so many developers that just have a fetish for reinventing the wheel, or in this case webapi
You're almost never supposed to call GetLastError through pinvoke. You're supposed to mark your MoveFileWithProgress pinvoke with SetLastError=true. And then you're supposed to call Marshal.GetLastWin32Error. That's because internally dotnet may screw with the last error in the space between pinvokes. If you pinvoke GetLastError, you're going to get the wrong value sometimes. That's not the real issue here though, but it's certainly a bug. 
I have enjoyed Mosh's videos. If you look around you can find coupons for even better deals. If you want to start at the beginning, there is a link in the comments of one of his intro to c# YouTube videos to obtain one of his Udemy course for free. 
I wasn't using the get last error through pinvoke as you mention as I'd also read that. I was using Marshal.GetLastWin32 error and the SetLastError attritube on my pinvoke method. The problem was, I was calling the method on another thread and then doing getlastwin32error on my original thread. Those errors are captured and stored on a per thread basis, so you have to call the getlastwin32error on the same thread otherwise it will not return what you might expect 
Author here: no raw SQL was a requirement from customer due to a very legacy database data model that had no foreign keys and a lot of associations between tables. The data model couldn't be updated either due to other applications depending on it. Using raw SQL to execute queries was very error prone. Dynamic runtime system was necessary as it was for a administration view that would basically be a simplified version of a database client (e.g. pgAdmin) for non-developer administrators. 
Will the framework ensure the stream is disposed as soon as the message is sent?
I would recommend pluralsight. There is a lot of MVC .net courses to follow along with, including web api stuff and angular front and webapi back. They all build interesting and fun stuff and are practical in the real world.
Just curious, why didn't you use HQL? This is no SQL, but allows SQL like queries while using the mapped classes and properties instead of the table and column names.
I've never actually looked at HQL. I'll check it out, thanks!
In this example, yes. It will dispose of the `IHttpActionResult`, which contains the `HttpResponseMessage` which contains `StreamContent` which contains `stream` (phew, that was a mouthful). But if for any reason you are in doubt, you can pass your disposable objects to `Request.RegisterForDispose` and it will dispose of any registered objects when the request/response is complete.
Ah, i couldn't see your code before, and it wasn't clear from your description what mechanism you were using. I saw the other comments about the real problem, but I also wanted to make sure you weren't calling GetLastError directly, which is a mistake I see a lot. So looks like you had it right all along!
I find it especially interesting that the anti-SQL movement really started picking up steam just after the height of the "DSLs are awesome, use them everywhere" movement. Was this a backlash against DSLs? Did people not realize that SQL is a DSL for data access? I never thought to ask.
I believe the argument is that SQL is a bad DSL. 
I still use [MvvmCross](github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross) myself, which is built on top of Xamarin.Droid and Xamarin.iOS and supports UWP as well. I haven't tried Forms in a while, I know it's getting better but I'm already down another path and that's the main reason I still choose MvvmCross for new projects. I do feel like a lot more of the knowledge I'm gaining by having to build UI using Interface Builder and AXML is transferable if I ever have to go Swift/Java for a project
MvvmCross looks very promising. 
I was in a similar position to you about 2 years ago. My history was VB6 and later winforms in .NET, but I wanted to make the jump to WPF. I had tried several times and failed miserably, finding xaml to be a complete mystery to me. What made it click for me? Adopting the MVVM mindset for sure. I decided to choose an MVVM framework and stick to that - I chose the PRISM framework, which at the time was a Microsoft Patterns and Practices maintained set of guidance and tools. Prism is now open source, and maintained by one of the original authors, Brian Lagunas. Check out his [website](http://brianlagunas.com/) I also watched a lot of Pluralsight videos, particularly around Prism version 5.0 which is what I started on. It has since moved on to its current [stable release 6.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Wpf/). I also chose Unity to use as my dependency injection framework, mainly because most of the examples in Pluralsight used Unity, and also because Prism is closely integrated with Unity (not the game engine by the way, a different Unity!) I was lucky in that my employer allowed me about 3 weeks of being unproductive and simply playing and learning the framework. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text! TLDR: There's no magic cure, just keep at it, but pick a framework that has lots of documentation and stick with it.
Oh, just to add - PRISM is more than an MVVM framework - it also allows for building modular, composite applications where you have a shell, and then one or more "modules" that can be loaded dynamically. It has been invaluable in making our software less "monolithic" and much more modular - easier to maintain and upgrade. To begin you may want something more "lightweight" than PRISM.
Thanks a lot for all those detailed reference. I don't know why you are getting downvoted but I am going to learn PRISM now and see where it leads me. I don't really find XAML to be confusing as it's pretty much XML with the parent-children relationship. What I find a bit confusing is the workflow in WPF. Like I am unsure if I need to make a ModelView for each instance of a window or parts of a window, etc. I don't really know the correct workflow which ends up getting really messy even on a small-scale application.
WPF does require some rewiring of the brain if you're coming from WinForm or other traditional GUI libraries. The ViewModel should be 1:1 with your model, it translates the data in your model to a form that can be display in one or more views. It also translates commands from your views into updates for your model. You can have multiple views bind to one viewmodel. For example a stock chart can show the graph data in one view, and in another the current price, both from the same view model that is attached to a database containing stock value history. Binding is simply the observer pattern combined with one-way or two-way data transfer. So if one side of the bind changes, the other is notified and can update with the new value. You can bind the value field of a control with a property in a view model, so data propagates when it changes without any additional work. Data binding also works for other properties of the control, so, for example, if you want the color of the text to be black for positive numbers and red for negative, you would bind the textcolor field to a property in your view model that is set to the sign of the value.
I recommend reading the pattern docs first and then try implementing it in WPF. I had a course online but it's no longer on edX.
I'm no OO expert, but don't think there's another way around it. When a child needs to know about its parent, there have to be reciprocal references. This is a fairly standard pattern, though. As u/VGPowerlord mentions, it's a form of dependency injection, called [constructor injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Constructor_injection).
Thanks, but I was looking for what matches in both strings, not searching one for a specific value.
@chippiearnold: I just want to say: thank you, you deserve more than an upvote!
I'm working on a [MUD (Multi User Dungeon)](https://github.com/LiamKenneth/MIM) basically a Multi player RPG it is text only but that is the beauty of it. It's also browser only rather than Telnet that is traditionally used. I started the project to learn C# Current features that are completed. * Character creation / login * Skills and spells * Scripted NPC's * NPC Dialogue trees * Can move around and interact with objects (get/drop/kill etc) * Web UI I'm currently looking at AI in an attempt to make my NPCs walk to places and react to wants or needs.
Are you paid by the line?
Seems like some temporary error in 1.6 or my bad maybe ;) Tested in 1.6.1 with normal program exit, computer shutdown and restart and it worked in all cases. Thanks again for a great program.
It's been around for a while and the main contributors are on [Xamarin Chat](http://xamarinchat.herokuapp.com/) if you ever get stuck
Whatever works for you really, but personally I'd avoid jumping into frameworks like Prism, etc. as a beginner. It adds a whole lot of other stuff that can be confusing/magic when you're trying to get an understanding of the basics. At its core MVVM is fairly simple: * View = your XAML * Model = your plain ordinary code * ViewModel = the glue in between. It provides the view with only the information it needs and hides the complexity of the model I'd recommend reading some of Rachel Lim's articles. e.g. as a starter: [A Simple MVVM Example](https://rachel53461.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/simplemvvmexample/)
&gt; not a requirement of MSBuild. Well no, because MSBuild doesn't know pretty much anything. It's all down to the target files, for example the C# targets file, which defines what MSBuild does. My main problem with MSBuild is that it binds the toolchain tightly (or at least even tighter) to MSBuild, which you may not always want to use. It's a bit the same with NuGet.
This is more a math (or calculation) question than a programming question.
"C#.Net"? :p
Tuples also have variable content. Actually, I am not sure what that means :p
Requires login to download. 
 var doctors = myEntity.Where(doctor =&gt; Condition(doctor)); myEntity.Doctors.Remove(doctors); myEntity.SaveChanges(); 
In C#, string.Contains() is case sensitive: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dy85x1sa(v=vs.110).aspx Does the description contain the word "Exception" with a capital "E"?
I did, and Thank You. I declare using var, when I should have declared using User. duh I simply should have been more explicit.
In addition to the other suggestions, you can change the code so you're only looking for "Exception" once, which is not only more efficient but also clearer: if (!user.Description.ToUpper().Contains("EXCEPTION")) { if (user.Enabled) { ddl_ActiveUsers.Items.Add(found.DisplayName); } else { ddl_DisabledUsers.Items.Add(found.DisplayName); } }
I had the same type of background and problem as yourself. To be honest, I'm still not sure I'm doing MVVM fully correctly (in fact I'm sure I'm not) so it definitely takes time. I found this tutorial quite helpful in showing me a practical example of an MVVM app with the minimum of code: http://www.markwithall.com/programming/2013/03/01/worlds-simplest-csharp-wpf-mvvm-example.html I would also second https://www.wpftutorial.net/ as useful for learning about individual concepts and controls.
My bad -- I always thought that a foreach loop evaluated like a for loop.
&gt;my manager does not want to use windows task scheduler anymore for certain reasons What are these reasons? 
The Output Window is a general purpose component for any Visual Studio feature, plugin/extension, or your application user code to be able to write to. In what use case scenario or context are you looking for information?
Could you be more specific? In the output window you can select what to output from the dropdown. In my case, by default it shows the debug output and i only stdout messages (Console.WriteLine() and Debug.WriteLine() for example) and a few other debug messages from the (what i believe to be) the runtime when it fails to load some assembly's. I've never seen assembly opcodes in that window (i can see assembly if i open the disassembly window but that's machine code and no IL)
I am exactly in the same position as you are. after reading the comments here my question is: is it worth learning WPF? I work as an engineer and my programming is more of a hobby. I'm an intermediate programmer but i would like to be more professional. most of my projects are small. basically to achieve a certain task which usually i can find my way around it in winForms. so ya my question is it worth learning WPF and is it the future ? the benifits of WPF and MVVM i'm seeing are: 1- better UI 2- easier to maintain and update apps its always great to have nicer UI however, when I want to make a small program, I want to produce it as quickly as possible so will learning all of this make the process slower ? or it will be faster to make such software (my projects include: calculations, graphs, downloading files, making custom excel sheets, database) etc... 
I modified the code as such, with the same results. The condition is working, as there are no results with the string in the description, but there are also a large amount of missing results that should be meeting the condition, as they do not have the string in their description. They're being excluded somehow and it only happens when I create the exception condition either the way I initially did it, or your modification. I put a breakpoint in the loop and F5'd through every iteration and the values are all consistent with the drop down population.
I modified it similarly as per suggestion from /u/Sasken. However: &gt; if (user.Description.Contains("Exception")) Is this a mistype? Wouldn't this evaluate to true for those that have the string in their description? I do not want to populate the dropdown with exceptioned users. I have: &gt; if (!user.Description.ToUpper().Contains("EXCEPTION")) 
Everything to do with the application as it happens. Exceptions get logged there. The loading process is detail. Incoming and outgoing requests. It's all there.
You are right. I meant: if (!user.Description.Contains("Exception"))
Removed: Rule 4. There are quite a few resources out there for creating Excel spreadsheets. A decent open source library is [EPPlus](http://epplus.codeplex.com/). With that you can iterate on your table content and transfer it to a spreadsheet in-memory. Give it a shot and if you have specific issues or questions, feel free to post them along with all relevant context and code.
[This](http://i.imgur.com/uOCEFbN.png) is what I tend to see. 
oh sorry about that, thanks for recommending EPPlus! Will look into it!
What doesn't work? Show us your code or logic?
 function() { }
I think what's happening is that some users do not have a Description set so user.Description is Null. You cannot call a method on a null object which is why exceptionCheck.ToUpper() is throwing a NullReferenceException. Check if user.Description is Null before attempting to work with it. Also, that's why /u/AngularBeginner [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/5sfbsp/stringcontains_in_a_loop_not_behaving_as_expected/ddeqhjh/) has the correct way for performing string Contains(). edit: [UserPrincipal.Description](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.directoryservices.accountmanagement.principal.description\(v=vs.110\).aspx) is indeed null if a description has not been set
You'll need to convert that pseudo code to actual code. I suggest assembler or FORTRAN, you know, for ease.
That's the trail I started down once I logged the exception. However, **all** the AD users have descriptions, even the ones not populating the drop down that should. I do get a null on the very first iteration of the loop, though, but every user afterward looks normal for the rest of the loop. Would that cause issues with further iterations where the description field is not null?
Send me a message if you would like help :)
yeah I know that part, its the actual removing it from the list that I'm having trouble with. Removing from the listbox is easy: listBox.Items.Remove(listBox.SelectedItems); It's removing it from the list in the background that I can't seem to figure out the code for 
If you check u/tweq's comment, he's linked a couple different methods for removing elements from a List&lt;T&gt;. If the elements in the list box and the ones in the list are in the same order, you may be able to use the selected indexes of the list box. If they're not, you'll need to grab the values selected in the list box, and use those to remove the elements of the list.
HTML is a markup language. C# is a programming language. They are apples and oranges. That might explain your confusion. There are numerous ways to get C# dev working on your Mac. Parallels and BootCamp come to mind as being the easiest because you're just running Windows. But Mono/.NET/C# is support on Mac natively if you want to figure out how to make it work. You might also find some online tools like [C# Pad](http://csharppad.com/) helpful. Not sure if it will allow you to accept console/user input but you could easily work out the rest of your assignment using that online tool alone. Finally, sorry to play the dad role, but if we just gave you the answer you wouldn't learn anything. You need to at least pony up some code and make an attempt. But hang in there. It's worth it. C# is awesome once it clicks.
Let me know if you received my PM! 
I implemented /u/AngularBeginner's class and it indeed threw an argument null exception straight away, and the debug stopped. It seems the very first object in search.FindAll is null, which I saw when stepping through the loop, assuming the first iteration is showing an actual result. On the first iteration, 'user' is indeed null, but 'found' has the value of the first actual AD user I would expect to see. This is something I was seeing before I was filtering out exceptioned users, and the first result was a blank entry in the drop down list, so I have an IsNullOrEmpty condition to remove it after I sort the drop downs. I don't know why this null entry exists in AD and whether I can exclude that from the collection prior to evaluating the description... ?
Derp. I just added this and it works now: if (exceptionCheck != null &amp;&amp; !exceptionCheck.Contains("Exception", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))
I am going to check this out. Thanks a lot!
Thanks
Thus is life. Don't feel bad about it. :) C# didn't click for me at first either and I had a similar background as you coming from basic HTML understanding. It took 2x for me to get it, but now make a living on it. Feel free to PM me if you need additional help.
As I comment above, findAll() is returning Principal types. The first 'found' is a subclass of Principal but not a UserPrincipal type, which is why 'user' is null when you try to cast it. When you're stepping through the code, check what type 'found' is in the first iteration.
In the past I've worked with Quartz.NET by maintaining the code that uses it. It wasn't bad but not particularly fantastic either. Note that I wasn't the one who actually implemented Quartz from the beginning and hence never had to deal with the headaches you mentioned. It's always easier to maintain code than write from a clean slate right? 
I meant 'this' as in your solution will work... Get over yourself buddy. I was just showing him how his code would look with your solution.
Assuming this is done in WPF, read up on ObservableCollection, basically acts like a list, as well as updates the UI automatically.
I didn't. I've migrated to the .csproj format; I changed the namespace and version ref to the new values, and did a dotnet restore - but it's still choking on the lack of a project.json $ dotnet --version 1.0.0-preview4-004233 $ dotnet ef --version Entity Framework .NET Core CLI Commands 1.1.0-preview4-22752 $ dotnet ef System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not find file '/path/to/project.json'. Seems like 1.1.0-preview4-final still doesn't support csproj/MSBuild - I either need to un-migrate back to project.json, or wait for (or find?) an update of Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("This will appear in the output window when you're debugging."); The above is very handy to me. You can also install this extension, which will colourise lines with error red, etc. It's configurable too: http://mike-ward.net/vscoloroutput/
One thing I don't understand is how you bind command to certain events. Like on Text Changed on Text Box clicked, etc?
Is this WinForms or WPF? We need to see more than a picture to help.
Yeah, tooling is a bit of a mess right now. This April or May we should see the release of .NET Core 2.0, .NET Standard 2.0, and VS 2017. Then we'll finally see some normalization.
At work most of my time is development in a legacy WinForms app. It uses all the Interop assemblies to do exports to the Office suite. It's pretty easy to use once you have the assembly in your application.
Thank you
Don't take this serious but just use one big ass excel sheet where each cell is the size of the smallest brick. Use multiple cells for larger pieces. 
 I'm pretty sure if you return the bare html for your table with an excel mime type it will either just open in excel or download as an excel file you can open up in excel directly 
We're running Quartz.Net and are happy with it, it's a solid lib. Haven't written a line XML, as someone commented.
Haven't heard of Fluent Scheduler. I'll take a look into that.. I truly appreciate it. Interesting.. I saw Quartz was one of the most popular on Nuget for task scheduling, though that certainly doesn't mean it's the best. I've actually been working a lot lately with SQL and XML feed for one of our servicers, but just like you, I would prefer to stay away from XML on this. 
Yea, I saw Hangfire as well. Tried to go through it on a Pluralsight course but it was somewhat difficult to understand the author. I like the UI too. Silly question, but if I wanted to execute a exe or .bat, would I need another library to do that or does Hangfire somehow do that for you? I couldn't find that in the documentation.
If you don't mind me asking, what do you use Quartz for in your business? Sending out emails or something? Just curious. I appreciate your response.
You *should* also be able to do items.Remove(listbox.SelectedItem); But there are cases where this won't work, depending on what/how it's bound, but arguably if it's available as an approach it is safer as there's no guarantee `listBox.SelectedIndex` is the same index as the the record in`items`. It would also arguably be smarter to rebind the ListBox whenever you update the underlying datasource, (eg ObserverableCollection in WPF), as you're otherwise assuming the job of maintaining consistency between the UI and the data when we already have tools for that.
I personally feel learning wpf in its natural state is important before diving into mvvm. Don't get me wrong, I love mvvm, I just imagine it would be too much learning a new platform on top of mvvm. 
I always use OrdinalIgnoreCase for such things. Should be the same, I guess. 
Just look for libraries that support OAUTH, there's plenty out there.

I completely agree with all points /u/Nugsly has brought up. But a few other points you should change are for example: Your namespace name should be changed from `EHH_Memorial_Manager___Management.Customer_editing_stuff` to `EHHMemorialManager.Management.CustomerEditing` or something similar (and I really don't recommend using the word stuff in any non-personal project) Methods names also should be PascalCased (for example DataObjects.cs is not very consistent with that) Methods like `Brick.customerFullName()` are usually a better fit for properties `public string CustomerFullName { get { return FirstName + " " + SecondName } }` Look into Linq as it's propably on of the most usefull things out there to make your code more readable (if you don't depend having the cutting edge best performance). For example MainMenu.cs 97-114 could be replaced by try { be.brick = bricks.First(b =&gt; b.systemBrickID == (int)dgvBricks.SelectedRows[0].Cells[0].Value); originalBrickIndex = bricks.IndexOf(be.brick); } catch (...) { ... } Maybe turn your usage of `ref` down a bit (I haven't used it once in 3 years of professional c# application development) and just use return values.

Run codemaid on it first. That should clear up most of the styling issues. http://www.codemaid.net/

 &gt; Maybe turn your usage of ref down a bit (I haven't used it once in 3 years of professional c# application development) and just use return values. In WPF/UWP it is quite handy to refer to the backing field for a property changed.
I too hate ref. There's always a better way, especially since Tuple came into the framework. 
&gt; ArgumentNullException("displayLine1") ArgumentNullException(nameof(displayLine1)) Prevents some issues when refactoring etc, hardcoding variable names as strings isn't ideal.
I've just "onelined" it for the purpose of fitting it inline, but yes that's also totally viable
In my limited experience with Entity Framework it is useful if your data models the objects in your code and you use these objects in your code often. EF basically removes/abstracts the data layer. It is also useful if you are developing the database off of an object as it can create the database for you. However if your data is just data I don't know if EF is that useful. I would just give it a try first. It isn't that hard to set up and grab data.
Yeah, it will remove the mapping process and I will have my object populated straight from DB. As I want to go with Code First approach, I wouldn't care how my data is stored in DB, or how it is extracted from it. These are my reasons to switch from ado net/stored procedures approach to EF. I just don't want to write and maintain these procedures anymore. But everything has a cost. The question is - what is the cost in this particular case?

If you haven't done any ASP.NET before, I would recommend you start with the prototypical/standard MVC style website. Get the lay of the land and basic understanding of the ins-and-outs of what makes a web site/application tick. While it might be nice to be able to build a website and develop it like a WPF application, there are fundamental differences which may throw you curve balls. That said, I haven't used DotVVM before, so I can't really comment on how good/bad it is. Still, all the more power to you if you want to dive in with it and get good results. Good luck!
Fantastic, thank you! 
I've never seen this before but it does look nice.
Would something like this work? Enumerable.Range(0, YearCash.Length) .Sum(i =&gt; YearCash[i] * Math.Pow((1 + (Lending_Rate * (1 - taxrate) * total_debt / (total_debt + x) + drate * x / (total_debt + x))), -YearTimeProjected[i]); Not sure what you're referring to with the "x is the lambda variable" though.
Awesome! That's it exactly. Thanks!
I don't recommend MVVM, it's burdensome and rarely needed in Web Development. The only *need* for it is if you build a dynamic reactive application that constantly is **pushed** to by the server. I always recommend the most minimal amount of UI glue / componentry as possible. The server should be responsible for nearly all data creation and transformation needs. The best tool I've found for this is IntercoolerJS. It let's you make simple http forms behave as dynamic ajax with next to zero effort. It also provides enough tools to build simple dynamic components such as an ajax ad rotator with no custom javascript. One thing that works awesomely with IntercoolerJS is to have REST API end points that return partial html. Like a single DIV or for a list of data return a TBODY
If the server is already running SQL (standard or above) you could utilize the Jobs to execute the process.
&gt; knowing ... seems to be overkill. It's never a mistake to know something, to be curious, and to learn.
Very interesting! Does the Stopwatch class support leap seconds and does it work if the user alters the system time while the Stopwatch is running? 
Removed: Rule 4. You'll have to make an attempt, and if you run into issues, post the code you have and a description of the error/problem. As it stands, the assignment text already lays out a lot of the program structure. Maybe see this for a quick introduction and example of classes: http://csharp.net-tutorials.com/classes/introduction/
well, I don't know if I understand it all Also it did take me quite a long time to dig through the code and work out what it was doing!
Fair enough.
Oh, neat! Thanks for sharing!
Ok, you do seriously need to put in some effort here. Google is your friend. Just look for how to set the mime type on on the response object within your .net controller (assuming .net mvc).
Identity Framework is a very thorough example of this, and more. It's worth looking at to get ideas, even if you don't end up using it.
Alright thanks
The "create" code blocks were originally the constructors, but the xml serializer won't work with any object who's constructor requires parameters. And I never thought about using a property like that. I'll probably change it.
I first used Telerik for web forms, and for what it is it's not bad. The controls can get a little bloaty though, or at least that was my experience years ago (I hope that's changed). Would jQuery UI work for what you need? 
the fact that I don't know what that search even means to begin with is already something lolll. but yeah I've been trying, I guess not hard enough. I found some code that shows how to implement exporting but it doesn't say where to put this code? https://www.paragon-inc.com/resources/blogs-posts/easy_excel_interaction_pt5
I was getting a deadlock with Folder.GetFilesAsync() and you cannot use ConfigureAwait(false) on it. Only tasks I thought? As I said I cannot use await or async in this method. I need to convert this into non async code.
I've used them, and it's *okay*. In some spots it's absolutely brilliant, and others you want to rip your hair out. My biggest gripe is that the `.ToDataSourceResult()` you need for server-side stuff requires an IQueryable to be returned from your database, which can sometimes break separation between your UI and your persistence layer. That said, I haven't a clue how to get around the problem without this.
Thanks. I don't know enough about the API yet, but I will keep your observations in mind when I get into details more.
Inside your Task.Run() lambda you are awaiting that call to GetFilesAsync(). The await keyword is only valid on Task objects, which I can deduce that either the code in the OP doesn't compile or GetFilesAsync() returns a Task&lt;T&gt;, which would mean you should be able to call ConfigureAwait(false) on it. But beyond that I'm definitely no async expert so I don't have any other suggestions to try. 
We use the MVC Telerik at work, and for the most part it's pretty good. I saw you mention that you were looking into the Spreadsheet control, it's API isn't that great compared to the standard Grid control, but if your users just need to enter information it should work fine. One thing I will say though, is their support team is excellent and they can help you through most problems you run into (if it hasn't already been solved on their forums)
"Hack" is a pretty good term for these kinds of things; it potrays that somethings works, and does what it's suppose to pretty well - but also that it's not the cleanest solution.
Thanks, that gets the job done but I hoped to learn more on this issue. 
Thanks man, I understand this is the proper solution using OOP, however, we are just learning what OOP is and I am not confident enough to write a full OOP based program yet. I will study your example to understand more of OOP, very much appreciated. 
Stopwatch measures elapsed time, not UTC or any other absolute time, so leap seconds don't apply. Also, it doesn't use system time, so I would assume it's not affected by changing system time while it's "running" (it's not actually running anything).
Since you for some reason want to convert it to synchronous.. IReadOnlyList&lt;StorageFile&gt; FilesCollection = Folder.GetFilesAsync().Result;
Well it certainly doesn't work then. I just get exceptions that the result is not ready. If I spin a while loop first for a second then it always works fine but that's hardly a solution.
Right now, I'm kinda learning WPF, MVVM and Prism(well, once I get the MVVM round my head). I'm a Junior Software Dev and company I work at uses it for most of the products. The codebase is pretty big. My background was University with much WinForms and a bit of WPF done really wrong way. Like the way WinForms would be done with no binding, commands etc. What I'm doing is I had a quick glance at WPF - XAML, Data Binding and Commands. Now, I'm moving on to MVVM. This is basically to save me time to unlearn doing all in code behind as MVVM promotes pretty much no code behind. Then, I am planning to move on to Prism with Unity container. What I found that number of good tutorials on MVVM is limited and for Prism there's even less. It's sometimes difficult to filter through all the crap to pick up something that explains code well and, most importantly, follows good MVVM practices. I would suggest doing a re-write of one of the apps and then post it somewhere for a code review. 
Hacks
I feel like several of those need some elaboration to explain what makes them questionable or useful. I *have* made use of dubiously designed or named extension methods and helper methods, possible abuse of reflection to find and wire up behavior from uncoupled methods in an assembly (detected with attributes!). I don't think any of those things, specifically, made the projects involved unmaintainable, though it could easily contribute to problems that way.
&gt;t's too long for a BFS, seems a bit messy... Yeah exactly what I thought, I have refactored it alot. So if you see it now it's pretty much broken in to little methods that do something. It looks cleaner now. Probably could be improved though. &gt;I think you overuse the 'var' keyword. Resharper recommends Var and the guys at work all use Var so just use it by default, hovering over the class name tells you the type. But you are right it's not clear at first Glance but the method name implies it's a list Thanks for your examples I'll go through them and hopefully be able to understand them and see where i can improve mine 
Technically chars are UTF-16 in C#, but the ascii table can be used for the first 127 chars as they (Unicode consortium) intentionally placed the ascii chars in the same place in Unicode. If you just have to deal with english letters and numbers then you can just forget about this technicality.
For our tools we use async everywhere and it all works pretty well. But this in particular is code that will be running on a background worker thread for a game and we don't want the async chain to follow all the way up to the top. Game code isn't really what async was designed to solve. So yeah a wrapper like that should work well, I will give it a go.
If they are ambiguous, then they're all anti-patterns
So, are unusual and vaguely defined solutions to unusual and vaguely defined problems bad or good? Is that the question? If it makes your code, on balance, better (for some definition of quality that weighs performance, maintenance, comprehensibility, etc, together), it's probably good. If it makes your code, on balance, worse, then it's probably bad. I am generally distrustful of 'clever' solutions to problems, but it's difficult to evaluate any given thing in a complete vacuum.
I haven't done that myself but a quick Google suggests using interaction triggers to achieve this. This is exactly what I mean when I say that it takes time. Even seemingly simple things like this end up requiring a few hours work sometimes just to get your head around them.
Sort of. The TempApp class will create instance of the Temperature class and pass values to it via that default constructor that your teacher is requiring. So you might see something like this in the TempApp class: Temperature celsiusToFarenheit = new Temperature(50); int FarenheitTemp = celsiusToFarenheit.ConvertToFarenheit(); The Temperature class will have those "Convert" methods which would return a converted value.
A hack, a kludge, a "workaround", a quick-fix, an anti pattern. For more information please see my CV.
It's impressive a person even has the passion to dive so deep into something that has been abstracted over by layers and layers. This level of focus reminds me of a buddy's father who's a English language linguist. Give him a word or a part of speech and he could go on for hours about semantics, phonetics, lexicon, origin etc. etc. I asked him once why he dedicated his life to a profession that most would consider extremely boring. He replied, "It's not boring to me!" haha 
Antipattern, code smell
If it's stupid, and it works, it's not stupid. But yeah, I would go with kludge
Do you have your own internet or is it community provided? If the former, type "my ip" into google to get the ip, then as was said in another comment you'll need to activate port forwarding on your router and forward whatever port you use, that'll open the door so to speak to allow incoming packets from outside the LAN to go to whatever computer the router is forwarding to. If you dont have total control over your internet (such as a dorm) then I'm not sure you can do what you're attempting but I'm not super experienced in that field myself.
Not a bad idea. Never tried it personally but I'd have to imagine that would work. I've used Hamachi for games but never looked into what exactly it does to know what you'd need to do different but I assume it'd be just a different ip. Report back!
Yeah, these are built into the language and not hacks at all - they reduce magic strings significantly.
Good answer i guess. It depends so heavily on the context. I dont wanna start throwing weird code up and asking if its good or it sucks, but heres one example of something I use constantly: Generic Dependency Property Declaration Wrappers: Heres a quick demo of the differences if youre interested: https://gist.github.com/CCRed95/3f0a0e794ea31029479da124f9be1c23

Maybe a Memory mapped File? https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.memorymappedfiles.memorymappedfile(v=vs.110).aspx
I don't remember anything about it. The name stuck in my memory becasuse there was a bug in the first VS.Net with dlls over a certain size. 
So are you suggesting that for "Randomly accessing" a file, it may be better to create your own "buffering" code, and only doing a new "read" when the requested value is outside the buffer?
I'm seriously going to have to play with this. Thanks!
Might depend on context. One could read the entire file into memory (relatively slow, but only done once), then access whatever random byte from RAM (fast). In that sense, it might be faster on the data I/O since it's (ideally) one big sequential read from disk without random access and it only needs to be done once. I think it might be worthwhile clarifying too what kind of file size we're talking about here. It's entirely plausible that any file of a decent/typical size (say, less than 10mb? Might depend on the hard drive.) this might be a very fast way of doing it. But if the file is 20gb, it probably will be very slow and have major RAM implications.
`BinaryReader`?
IIRC, this depends a lot on the operating system. I would give this guy a read. It isn't C# but it should give you some good ideas on what to do to get absolute blazing speed. It is for rust, but the tool (a grep alternative) is extremely IO bound, so there is a ton of work to make it as fast as possible. http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/
what did you expect the output to be? tcp is reliable and has backpressure so your client isn't losing messages. id guess you've made a logical mistake somewhere. unrelated, but you've picked a difficult socket api. if you want to use tcp, use tcplistener/ tcpclient and their async methods.
As you allude at the end - if you need to pull data from a drive as fast as the hardware will deliver, then I'm sure there's a Win API to use. If that makes one take a step back and say "Well, I'd prefer to stay in native managed code" then we uncheck "as fast as possible" and go back to "best standard method in managed code" with the acknowledgement we're trading some speed for ease-of-engineering and maintenance. 
Because your TabControl has `height="23"`. Remove this and it will work. As a sidenote: `seperator` is a horizontal seperator. I don't think you'll get the desired effect with it. Oh, and if you're making a grid layout, just use Grid Rows and Columns.
It doesn't add a new dependency.. instead the singleton is updated in place.. the object ref in the di container doesn't change and it's important to keep it that way so that services that declare a `ValuesConfig` see the changes.
I just finished a project where we read very large files from disk. Our project is C# .NET 4.5.2 and we ended up reading the files with unmanaged C++. We used fread and fseek. I don't have any benchmarks but I know the code was capable of reading a couple gigabytes in a second. Consider using 'pinned' memory when copying the data from unmanaged to managed as I understand that is faster. We didn't as we ran out of time. Choosing the correct data structure can save time as well. I've had some tough times with vectors in the past: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1905417/array-vs-vector-vs-list. Maybe you just need a byte buffer. Also, I always wanted to benchmark 32 vs 64 bit applications as 64 is probably faster. We were stuck with 32 for reasons beyond my control. If you have control over the hardware you can choose high end servers or workstation. I remember reading about some Intel bus technology that can double our quadruple throughput. You should have a good chunk of RAM, maybe there is a way to pre-cache. While on the topic of hardware, think about the disk your are reading from: choosing the best cluster size, data read sizes, having sequential data on disk, SSDs and maybe stripping RAIDs. Although some of these concepts might be a bit dated. 
Where are you hovering on the expression? The hover will only evaluate the operator that you hover over, so in this case, hovering over either of the == symbols will only evaluate the individual sections. What happens if you hover of the OR operator (||)?
Hovering over the || gives me false.

You modified `nextPoint`. In the context of the line you're currently debugging, `nextPoint` has a potentially different value than it did in the condition. To my knowledge, the debugger doesn't keep track of old values when examining previously executed expressions. (This also applies to `indices.Count` after calling `Pop`.)
To be fair, there is a lot of tool support out there for catching misspelled property names and updating string literals when renaming a property. I love the new attributes, but we still built some pretty great support without them.
I know that you already found the solution, but next time you run into seemingly inexplicable behaviour like this, just split the if statement into parts so that you can narrow it down: var a = ( indices.Count == points ); var b = ( nextPoint == points ); var c = ( a || b ); if (c) { } Now it is trivial to halt on the exception and see what is going on.
AFAIK, files are mmap'd a page at a time, and the OS loads page lazily rather than eagerly.
Binary reader should be a lot faster, there's no processing the results.
interesting but a badass way of measuring performance of code would be to use the rdtsc instruction to counts the number of CPU cycles before the start of your code and then again count the the number of CPU cycles at the end of your code and then subtract the two. 
&gt; "It's not boring to me!" I guess I can relate to that :-)
Guy a couple of desks over , built an app that loaded a dll, found all the types derived from another types, used string substitution to create source, called MS build build to compile and then moved the new dll (via FTP) to a live server. Often used to complain that it crapped out. Although he asked for help on occasion, I was too busy :) Edit added "build"
I don't use Tuples for the same reason I don't name my variables like variable1, variable2, etc. If I need to return multiple values I make a class.
String.Format ("{0} {1}", FirstName, LastName); 
Me too. I hate questions with a binary answer that dont let you find out about the company, or the company to find out about you 
wow been doing SSCCE for years and didnt know it was a thing .. TIL here I come
Yeh - this is actually a great use case of reflection techniques that sounds like it could benefit from some optimization 
Hi, Try to use unqualified classnames , they make reading a little bit harder. public List&lt;*Room.Room*&gt; AssignCoords() I'm more easy going on var, dont mind em :) can you simplify this var lastOrDefault = getRoom.exits.LastOrDefault(); return lastOrDefault != null &amp;&amp; x.areaId == lastOrDefault.areaId; with a [tertiary] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ty67wk28.aspx) operator Id consider either an extention method or a private method to centralise all the *direction == "North"* E.G. private static bool IsNorth(string s) { return s.IsNullOrWhiteSpace() == false &amp;&amp; s.Trim().ToLower() == "north" ; } 
Previous discussion... https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/fozkk/interview_questions_for_senior_software_engineers/
If you hang around StackOverflow for a little while, you're sure to run into the term because a large portion of questions could really benefit from one. I don't understand people's aversion to making one when asked, though. There are problems I've solved on my own while making one and problems where the SSCCE has allowed me to properly Google the answer. For example, my Python code wasn't working. I eventually whittled it down to ++i not modifying i. That allowed me to find a StackOverflow question I never would have found before. Or in C#, my hook wasn't working, with a strange outcome. Making a minimal example, I was able to find an existing answer that the garbage collector had collected my handler and that I needed to make it a field. Making one shows you value others' time and immensely cuts down on back and forth clarification. It's a shame there's such an aversion to them. As an aside, StackOverflow has its own MCVE term that most users say instead of SSCCE, linking to a page on its own site, but they're the same thing in principle. 
So, I need to create the detector in the Cam_NewFrame(), before the if statement, or in the very start of the program, before Form1_Load?
Umm, not that I'm claiming any responsibility for this, but there may have, at one time years ago, been a piece of software that needed to display local SSRS reports. Said software existed in an environment that had access to *very* limited and *very* expensive satellite internet, and said reports changed or were added to on a monthly basis. And that shitty expensive internet was the only way to update the software and reports. The actual DLL's were updated by transmitting new versions via the middleware app and a database table; they were broken up into about 10KB blocks and sent over the course of...forever. Someone, and I won't name names, but *someone* had the brilliant idea of storing all of the report information, parameter information, and DLL's with report data object definitions in a SQL table. Data in the SQL database was synchronized anywhere from hourly to daily, so this kept these stupid reports up to date and people happy. A generic report viewing window was used globally in the application, and reflection was used to: - Instantiate the report data object by the fully qualified assembly name (varchar in database) from the DLL which was loaded programmatically from the database. - Drag the XML report definition from the database and turn it into a stream to feed to the report viewer. - Call the member function to populate the data object from the database. - Call the member function that generated lists of report parameters to pass to the report. - Call the member function that generated a list of subreport data items to pass to the subreport handler. It was a horrific nightmarish piece of code that could have (and should have) been dealt with in other ways, but it worked at the time...
Thanks, I suspected it was already here in the past because it's so old, but it's so good it's worth a repost, especially since the community ebs and flows so much,
This comment was kind of funny. https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/fozkk/interview_questions_for_senior_software_engineers/c1hjy22/
I'm on mobile, so the code is tough to read, but i can't tell what it is. I can say that when working with EPPlus i haven't had to use an ExcelService and the only thing in EPPlus that would return a stream is something that wrote out tree resulting file. It looks like it's just a way to separate out the logic of writing to Excel.
Expand references in the project, does the system.core reference have a warning triangle on it? If it's there but broken, you can't add it, you can only add then remove.
Do you have an example of this? I'm actually curious
OnPropertyChanged(nameof(MyPropertyNaem)) &lt;- Typo's caught by compiler.
Can't wait for Update 1 to be released for it to be useful! Sorry, I just hope that vs2017 will have fewer teething troubles than vs2015 had. I guess the switch to Roslyn in vs2015 is somewhat comparable to the the rough start Vista had after introducing a new driver model. 
There are quite a few plugins and add-ons still missing for 2017. I'll only be able to fully jump on board once they're available. 
There's no references folder for me to expand. Where else can I look for that? 
ah gotcha that makes sense
Which ones are you missing in particular?
I totally disagree that these are ego questions per se. I can see how a few of them are phrases or concepts from one's own path but they are all pretty universal. More importantly, we're talking about a large, unrelated, ~50 bullet point list. Imho if anybody wants to pick it apart, you have to get specific because the hiccups in the list are few and trivial at best.
Unfortunately the integrated Bower still installs wrong packet version :'( Besides that I really like VS 2017 so far :)
Also missing Browser Link which used to be part of Web essentials. Extremely useful when debugging large projects and trying to find View files in the solution
As you said, I expect vs 2017 should be much more stable at launch since they don't have to re-write the whole system around Roslyn and Core. Although I do expect that waiting for Update 1 will beneficial especially for their new Core tooling. That's the stuff that will be unstable at first.
I think this will genuinely be one of the first times a Microsoft product with a year in the name will be released in the first quarter of the year.
I didn't even read the whole list, just thought the comment was funny. 
I suspected as much (re: T4). We have an enormous T4 system at my current workplace that compiles our proprietary markup language into a custom abstraction on top of cshtml. It's horrible.
I still have the huge MFC class diagram poster that shipped with VC++ 5.0 some where.
There should be a references "node" in the root of your project. If not you have an older project type with a bin folder. 
Yes I do have a Bin folder, here's what I see there: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In the sub folder: EntityFramework.dll EntityFramerwork.dll.refresh EntityFramework.xml &amp;nbsp; In the sub folder: EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll.refresh EntityFramework.SqlServer.xml &amp;nbsp; In the sub folder: System.WebProviders.dll System.Web.Providers.dll.refresh System.Web.Providers.Xml Edit: It's worth noting know of these have warnings next to them in the menu. 
Let's hope C# 7 is stable at that point. There were semantic changes to it less than a few weeks ago.
For us, it has been "fine". Some errors here and there in few months' time, but nothing too cumbersome that wouldn't be fixed by restarting it.
I am not up to date about coolness, but it's the default for frontend packages in ASP.NET Core templates.
To add a bit more detail: * It only shows on the project.json file, none of the other files in the assembly * It's definitely VS specific - I can dock VS to the left of my screen and the logo moves with it * Clicking on it cycles through full visibility (as shown), slightly opaque, and then completely hidden Anyone else seen this!?
They won't have warnings, the bin folder is just that, a folder. The compiler looks in there for assemblies. You have a website project type, which is an older but still supported project type that doesn't use references, it just looks at whats in the bin folder and possibly the GAC. I'd really have to see the project and environment to diagnose the problem at this point. 
School assignments are the worst because they always make things unnecessarily difficult (there are much easier ways to do this..). So I will assume that you are correctly getting words from the user. I would then go about this to handle one word at a time, and perhaps add them to a collection in the correct order, then print the words in the collection (maybe there is some easier way..) List&lt;string&gt; wordsOrdered = new List&lt;string&gt;(); if(same1 &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; same2 &lt; 0) wordsOrdered.Add(word1); ..... foreach(string word in wordsOrdered) Console.WriteLine(word); Does this help?
So, if refreshPage() function gets called at least once that means Send() is being called server side at least once. So, you call Send() every time the database is updated? I would start by overriding the OnConnected and OnDisconnected methods of the Hub. Verify the the client is connected and not disconnected immediately. Also, use the browser dev tools to check the websocket connection is still live. Kinda taking a shot in the dark here as there isn't much to go on.
the code you posted seems to be working correctly, even if it's not doing what you expect. you are calling send once from your connection start callback, so I'm guessing you are missing some logic server side. you have 2 options: 1.) post chat messages to your rest api. Use the signalr connection manager to get the hub context from the api controller and call your send method after inserting into your database. 2.) send chat messages over the signalr connection. Add a message argument to your send method and have your send method broadcast to all clients and also do your database insert. 2 is probably what you want, its simpler and you can avoid an extra round trip
as for the sorting. I would add the values to a List and then sort that List. Because this is homework, and because a big part of being a dev is learning to research I don't want to just give you the answers (20+ years in this and EVERY SINGLE DAY I am looking for something. Don't get discouraged, it's just part of the job) The LIST object can hold a collection of objects. So, for example: List&lt;int&gt; listOfNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt;(); listOfNumbers.Add(100); listOfNumbers.Add(76); This creates a collection of numbers. You want to create a list of strings, then Google how to sort a C# List (see, giving hints, not answers. I know this can seem mean, but you NEED to get your mind to learn to work it out) Best of luck 
I think bower is great for quick and lightweight apps, with few dependencies. But if you want to use one of the newer frameworks, you're probably better with something like jspm, which makes dependency resolution much more manageable.
So, Anchoring fixed the stretching of the textboxes. Thank you for that! I still have some textboxes which have disappeared, so I'll look into that!
Wasn't it called Visual Interdev back then?
Hopefully Python will be back. Taken away a few weeks ago.
I agree with /u/x0nnex here. These are some shitty restrictions. This is totally do-able, but I don't want to just give you the code. But this should help... var firstWord = "z"; var secondWord = "e"; var thirdWord = "a"; Console.WriteLine(firstWord.CompareTo(secondWord)); Console.WriteLine(firstWord.CompareTo(thirdWord)); Console.WriteLine(string.Empty); Console.WriteLine(secondWord.CompareTo(firstWord)); Console.WriteLine(secondWord.CompareTo(thirdWord)); Console.WriteLine(string.Empty); Console.WriteLine(thirdWord.CompareTo(firstWord)); Console.WriteLine(thirdWord.CompareTo(secondWord)); It looks like the `a` always has a total score (-2) less than `z` (2).
This feature is a part of the Web Essentials extension, specifically.
Not in the release. When they took it out they said it wasn't going to be stable in time for release and would come as an update when it was.
I used reflection to serialize the state of a game I'd created; it could take upwards of 15 minutes until I got the bright idea to compile and cache lambda expressions for each property getter/setter!
Why would you use Unity on a project that's not a game? Did it involve some sort of 3D graphics?
Are you trolling? I said IoC...
Oh, is Unity IoC something completely different from the Unity game engine? I thought it was a component of the engine...
I need reporting and SSIS support and, as far as I can tell, it isn't included. Maybe those tools are not part of SSDT? 
I've been using it with Unity for a while and haven't had any problems, but it's still in RC, so your mileage may vary.
how much will it cost? Edit: Not sure why this was down voted?
I would never use an RC in production. I wouldn't even try it before it is RTM. But if it works fine I will evaluate it next month.
I don't know about coolness either, but NPM is definitely the standard these days.
Not sure why asking a question is down voted so much, here have a +1, don't stop being inquisitive.
Any language could be used for anything. The difference is the support of the language for that platform. With .NET Core it is possible to run C# on non-Windows platform, yes. Mobile application development can be done in C#, yes. And it is especially useful if you can target three platforms with one code base. But your question(s) are broad and wide ranging. The only way you can find out for certain is to do some first hand research.
I'm sure you could build native mobile applications using Python and Cordova or PhoneGap? If you want to code on Linux try .NET core, I believe there is a repository on GitHub.
Why does this need to be asynchronous?
There is no non async version in the API. The whole thing is happening on a background thread anyway, I don't want it to be asynchronous.
They've still got a tendency to release stuff too early, but otherwise they're probably one of the most developer friendly companies these days. Weird isn't it.
The MVVM framework was an internal company lib, but I'll see if I can open source parts of it. See sibling replies for details.
Yeah I'm not sure why you're being downvoted either. I can't find any pricing information, but I'd assume they'd provide a free Community edition as with previous installments, and the Professional and Enterprise versions will have similar pricing to the [now current pricing model.](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/)
Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing TBH
90% chance of it costing the same as VS2015. I would assume they would have mentioned something by now if the licensing model changed.
I think MS has always been developer friendly. It's a little bit why they're so successful. 
But that's just a licensing issue. You either have to buy or are in the condition to use the community edition. 
I still have to decide what to use, but for people new to ASP.NET Core it would help if the template works out if the box, even if it's not the absolute best that's doable with this technology choice. I think there is nothing more frustrating while learning a new language/framework when you can't even get the provided template to work properly and when you ask questions about it you get called out for doing such nonsense things.
No, it is a small WinForms application that has only about 16 ".cs" files (excluding designer-generated), and the real-time seems to have been already turned off.
Separation of concers. You have one layer for the Controller (http handling) and other for Excel (database and EppPlus). This way you will be able to create tests upon ExcelService withtout having to scaffold any controller, you will be able to reuse that code in other controller actions... I would separate the database logic from ExcelService to a different bussines layer and call it from controller passing its results to the ExcelService.
I am using VS2017 RC, and do not have VS2015. So, do you think that R#'s slow typing is mostly because VS2017 is in RC status?
Try clearing the resharper cache https://www.google.ca/search?q=clear+resharper+cache&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA702CA702&amp;oq=clear+resharper+cache&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.3935j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 Not linking that to be a dick, but the google anwser is the best one. Short of that I would say uninstall and reinstall Resharper. It def does slow VS down a *bit* but not to the level you are saying..
I would've understood if youtube-dl was a complicated library, but it seems like it's already simple. Is this additional abstraction really necessary?
I didn't actually mean this particular instance. I've been using VS 2017 since it stabilised in early December. I meant more their somewhat universal tendency to release a version one which is an incomplete mess and then drastically altering it. .NET core, SharePoint apps, sharepoint sandbox solutions. A lot of the workflow stuff as well. Their phones. The surface. I could go on. Microsoft has a tendency to release new ideas half baked, it's not new either.
&gt; Project Rider I had never heard of it before, but it looks promising (apparently it is in its early development stage), given that their IntelliJ is feature-rich. VS Code may only be good for special cases, such as web development. As far as I know, it has no GUI designer.
Except TFS and support they have feature parity.
yes it's called gitlab CI
Removed: Rule 4. You'll have to make a more concerted effort than that and ask a more specific question about specific issues you have. As others have stated, ideally your best resources of questions of this fundamental nature would be your text books (or learning materials), peers/classmates, and instructors. That said, you're already on the right track. You output the question to the user, and you are converting a `string` to a `double`. To read input from the user, you can use the `Console.ReadLine`. Once you have all your inputs, you can do the arithmetic necessary with them to determine the total fee.
will try and do that! thanks~
`CInt` (IIRC) is a Visual Basic function to convert a string into an integer. However, such a function doesn't exist in C#. I assume that the code you're lifting this from is either VB or has its own `CInt` function. As I understand it, the VB `CInt` function has some of its [own behaviour](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2dy91zy.aspx) that might not _directly_ translate 1:1 to C#, but you can use `Int32.Parse` or `System.Convert.ToInt32` methods as a replacement or for understanding its purpose.
&gt; Probably downvoted because there's a free version now. That there's a free version doesn't mean all versions are free. And those have a price. And you can ask for those prices.
Ah, okay. Sorry. Thanks for your help!
Why not .netfiddle/glot.io/csharppad? or Git+AppVeyor 
&gt; Mobile application development can be done in C#, yes. Yes but will it look, feel and perform native on iOS and Android?
System.Core.dll is auto-referenced by Visual Studio and MSBuild. The problem could be a wrong framework target.
Yes.
&gt; If there was a web site that the user can just submit the code files and downloaded the compiled result, it would be much easier. How does that prevent this case: &gt; Users must trust me to believe that the "exe" does not do any harmful things secretly. Best way to do this, is to put your source files in a public repo, and then provide a complied exe in the description with a checksum to verify the integrity.
It's useful for data binding to UI controls, which is my eventual goal. 
Well, if the site is an established site, the site can be more trustable than a nobody like I. 
You can use Visual Studio online to build your project. 
YES. 'targetframework' has the following error associated with it: "The targetframework attribute is not allowed." 
"\Web.config(15): Build (web): It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition='MachineToApplication' beyond application level. This error can be caused by a virtual directory not being configured as an application in IIS."
But your source code is your source code. The site reputation doesn't matter, what matters is your code right?
