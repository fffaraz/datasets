&gt; Thank you for another ad-hominem :) Will start collecting them. There is no ad hominem here. This is just yet another example of you using phrases you do not correctly understand. &gt; I'm quite sure Yes, that's the problem. No matter how frequently you're incorrect, you remain certain that there are no errors in the new stuff. &gt; And again, if you do not agree with Java's enum implementation I never said this.
&gt; As you tag the idea as stupid, one would assume the chances of you explaining why '[I] don't even know what it's for' are getting quite slim? Given that you continue to be dishonest, that you are mass replying to comments that are not spoken to you, and that you continue to insist I haven't explained things I've explained? Yes, the chances of you receiving even more help, due to your behavior, are slim. &gt; I have offered you sending proof Proof of what?
&gt; I have asked you numerous time for contributions. And you've gotten a "no" every time. &gt; If you decline, there is not much I can do for the library or its users (if any). Wrong. You could apologize for the bad behavior, thank me for the help you've received, and ask what the defect is. You just don't have the quality of character. &gt; Case closed. He says, going on to write five more posts. Honesty is pretty hard for you, isn't it?
&gt; as mentioned seve Please stop mass repeating yourself.
&gt; Thanks for the write-up. You're welcome.
I just facepalmed. Hard. &gt;I'm assuming you do know what polymorphism is. Yes, I do. However, you do not seem to realise that, in a strongly typed language, if you're returning an object as one of its superclasses, it gets casted to that type. You wouldn't be able to access any of its methods that were defined in the subclass without typecasting it. Furthermore, it would be plain idiotic to try to access methods which only exists in some subclasses on objects which are returned by the getModel() method. If you need to access those methods, return the object as the type in which the methods are defined in, either by classname or interface.
http://xdebug.org/ works with anything!
So let me get this straight. I need to 'thank you' for the help you provided in another completely unrelated thread, even though I have [already done so](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hj13r/reddit_whats_hot_ranking/c1vwzd5)? Although, just in case, if that wasn't adequate: thank you again.
Hereby, once and for all, would you be so kind to explain: 1. How I do not understand the Java implementation correctly? 2. How the library greatly differs from Java's? The 'not expecting miracles' was unfortunately poorly phrased. I meant you actually providing answers to the above questions, not questioning the existence of defects. As seen in the rest of this thread, I am perfectly capable of dealing with defects and enhancements, and am patiently waiting for you to enlighten us.
Proof of not having downvoted more than one comment (see private message). As for continuation of this thread, your [well-deserved thanks](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hih3j/php_enumeration_library/c1vy2u6) and the [outstanding questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hih3j/php_enumeration_library/c1vy3tx) 
In mathematics and theoretical computer science, the broadest and most abstract definition of an enumeration of a set is an exact listing of all of its elements (perhaps with repetition). The restrictions imposed on the type of list used depend on the branch of mathematics and the context in which one is working. In more specific settings, this notion of enumeration encompasses the two different types of listing: one where there is a natural ordering and one where the ordering is more nebulous. These two different kinds of enumerations correspond to a procedure for listing all members of the set in some definite sequence, or a count of objects of a specified kind, respectively. **While the two kinds of enumeration often overlap in most natural situations, they can assume very different meanings in certain contexts.** You sir, suck giant donkey balls.
&gt; in a strongly typed language, if you're returning an object as one of its superclasses, it gets casted to that type. OK, but we're talking about loosely-typed PHP here, where the typing is only being hinted at via PHPDoc. (And there are strongly-typed languages that allow you to do this). &gt; Furthermore, it would be plain idiotic to try to access methods which only exists in some subclasses on objects which are returned by the getModel() method. Look at Codeigniter's [model manual page](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/models.html). This seems to be exactly how CI does it. I just downloaded CI to have a look at it, and there's no way you're going to get hinting for those custom model methods. CI's Loader does stuff like this: $CI-&gt;$name = new $model(); Where $name is the pointer to the model, and $model is the class name. Basically, I'm saying the same as you. Don't use a generic getModel() type method to return subclasses that have differing interfaces. 
Wordpress and Drupal aren't really frameworks... you should learn some OOP and go for zend framework, symfony, kohana, yii,...one of those... I'd recommend you codeigniter for starters but I'm not even sure myself how much life left it has. If your idea is to just create websites, then yeah wordpress and drupal are alright for that. Drupal is harder though, and more flexible...it's what the web development world is hyping right now...might be worth checking it at some point. But OOP is a must. However, if you know what you're doing I'm pretty sure you might get a job doing procedural php too, though you might need to look for some company which is working on legacy code...not sure if it will be the biggest learning experience for you.
&gt;OK, but we're talking about loosely-typed PHP here So? Your IDE isn't executing it, and can therefore not know what type of object is actually being returned by the method. &gt;where the typing is only being hinted at via PHPDoc. Precisely. That's all the IDE knows about, since it does not execute the code. If you know all the subclasses, then you can define all of them as return types in PHPDoc. Simply separate the different types by a pipe (|) character. &gt;Look at Codeigniter's model manual page. Huh? I don't see it trying to access methods which are not defined in the type it claims to be returning. &gt;Don't use a generic getModel() type method to return subclasses that have differing interfaces. Or do use a generic getModel() method which returns subclasses, but trying to use methods which are not defined in the superclass would be mind-numbingly stupid. 
Maybe you should read the definition of enumeration again. You say his implementation is close to "a broken lisp atom system", guess what that system is classed as? Yup, Enumeration.
I think he meant that as more of a time-saver than a literal statement. Using SSH and coding from VIM is more less the same thing as coding locally since you're editing the files directly on the remote server. I think the point was simply that he needs to know how to run PHP and edit the configuration files and that updating a file though FTP every single time you make an edit is incredibly inefficient.
You just answered all the questions I've had about shoring up my PHP knowledge in one post. You are a gentleman and a scholar. :)
Yeah, I just felt like I had to open my mouth and tell my opinion. But yeah, I know what he was trying to say :P
I'm glad that you found my post useful. 
WTF? You trolling me? class Blog_controller extends CI_Controller { function blog() { $this-&gt;load-&gt;model('Blog'); $data['query'] = $this-&gt;Blog-&gt;get_last_ten_entries(); $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('blog', $data); } } $this-&gt;load-&gt;model always returns a subclass of CI_Model. CI as a framework cannot know the actual type in advance (in this case 'Blogmodel'). CI's authors only know it's going to be a class that extends CI_Model. CI encourages it's users to define and call methods of the subclass. get_last_ten_entries is a **method of the Blog_controller subclass**. &gt; I don't see it trying to access methods which are not defined in the type it claims to be returning See above. &gt; If you know all the subclasses, then you can define all of them as return types in PHPDoc. Simply separate the different types by a pipe (|) character. So you're proposing editing the PHPDoc for a core function of the framework **on a project by project basis**. If I have forty models, I have to define forty return types, and the IDE still doesn't know which one is being returned. Good luck with that. That's it, I'm done. Agree to disagree. 
&gt; Maybe you should read the definition of enumeration again. Maybe. Or maybe I already know what they are, and don't really care if some random redditor claims I'm wrong without evidence. &gt; You say his implementation is close to "a broken lisp atom system", guess what that system is classed as? Yup, Enumeration. Uh, no, it isn't. Atoms aren't numbers. Enumerate means "to make into numbers." En numerate. You're full of crap.
&gt; In mathematics and theoretical computer science, the broadest and most abstract definition of an enumeration of a set is an exact listing of all of its elements (perhaps with repetition). To enumerate is to assign numbers to a list. Nothing more, nothing less. You can wave your hands around about how in mathematical and theoretical computer science the definition is a sentence that you came up with, but that just doesn't fit the other things you said, such as &gt; You say his implementation is close to "a broken lisp atom system", guess what that system is classed as? Yup, Enumeration. Oh what a surprise, a lisp atom system has nothing to do with "an exact listing of all of its elements (perhaps with repetition.) &gt; In more specific settings, this notion of enumeration encompasses the two different types of listing: one where there is a natural ordering and one where the ordering is more nebulous. This is, of course, also garbage. Enumerations are not ordered, which is why one of these isn't magically wrong: enum { hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds }; enum { clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades }; To suggest that there are "two different kinds of enums," which are just "one with this characteristic I named turned on, and one off," is just silly. For any binary characteristic, there's always the class with it on and the class with it off; you're just reciting tautologies. Can you find any reference that agrees with you, or are you just telling stories? &gt; While the two kinds of enumeration often overlap in most natural situations, they can assume very different meanings in certain contexts. And yet these "two kinds" of enumeration seem to have no evidence of existing outside of your reddit comments. Hmmmmm. Wonder what that could mean. &gt; You sir, suck giant donkey balls. This from the guy that thinks lisp atoms are numbers.
&gt; Hereby, once and for all, would you be so kind to explain: No. You should have not waited 25 posts to get around to it. It's much too late, which I've already told you repeatedly. &gt; The 'not expecting miracles' was unfortunately poorly phrased. Also the various personal attacks, the claims I hadn't explained things I had, the constant attempts to get me to explain a claim I've never made, et cetera. &gt; I meant you actually providing answers to the above questions Yeah. It'd take a miracle for me to repeat the things I keep telling you I already explained. Mostly because I keep saying "no, stop asking" and you keep asking. You're the little brother on a sitcom. &gt; As seen in the rest of this thread, I am perfectly capable of dealing with defects and enhancements I don't see anyone else telling you about any defects, sir. &gt; and am patiently waiting for you to enlighten us. I don't know why. I keep telling you "no, you've been too rude. That door is closed."
&gt; Proof of not having downvoted more than one comment (see private message). And you would prove that, how? By taking a screen shot, then insisting it wasn't of you logged out, or of you after you un-clicked the arrows? Why are you still wasting time on this? Stop asking me for help. I've been telling you "no" all day. You don't get to be a dick for 20+ messages then say thank you one time and expect more help.
If it helps, you sound like half the developers I've ever worked with. If I were you, school up on the stuff you'd have to do if you were working with a real team of developers instead of on your own. You need to understand revision control, and that most shops operate with a dev environment and a production environment (and sometimes staging which is somewhere in between). As for an IDE, I find syntax highlighting and simplified deployment are pretty much 90% of what I need from an IDE. As for frameworks, go play with CodeIgniter and follow a few sample tutorials and you'll grok it in no time. OOP is something you can pick up with a good book. Also, a parting bit of advice.. just be confident in yourself, and don't be intimidated by people with what seem to be more cred than you. I never liked working with people who weren't pushing their limits anyway, they stop learning. Edit: After reading the comments, TIL I'm not a terrible developer, and I really should go back to doing that as my profession (this support stuff is a layer of hell Dante didn't know of.)
&gt;WTF? You trolling me? No. I'm working from the information you've provided, namely the documentation. The page you linked to mentioned nothing about utilising methods which have been defined in a subclass. &gt;So you're proposing editing the PHPDoc for a core function of the framework on a project by project basis. No, I am not. I don't even know where you got that from, or why you suddenly decided to mention CodeIgniter. What I am saying is that there's no reason why you would expect to be able to see the methods of a type OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN DEFINED AS THE RETURN TYPE. To display methods of subclasses wouldn't even make sense.
No evidence? Orly? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type
In one of my college courses we were introduced to lots of managers of programmers and development staff from big name companies (Microsoft, Apple, Novel) Most quoted that they expect a person to be up to speed around the 6 month mark. 
See above links...
I did. You're still full of crap. Atoms aren't numbers, and you cannot enumerate a repeated list. En numerate. You have no idea what you're talking about. Stop wasting time pretending that I should care about the Bullschildt on wikipedia.
1) I said you had not provided evidence. You had not. Doing so later doesn't make me retro-actively wrong: at the time I spoke, you had given no form of defense. 2) Wow, a wikipedia page. Gasp as well as choke: you cut and pasted its first sentence, and its first sentence, as I already showed, says your other quoted position which you're now trying to retreat from is wrong. 3) Funny thing: you are arguing by literally cutting and pasting wikipedia, apparently without understanding it, yet you still expect to be taken seriously. When errors are pointed out, you just ignore them. I wonder what you'll do when you notice Wolfram Mathworld disagrees with your non-authoritative source. 4) Funny thing: that wikipedia page doesn't say a damn thing about "two kinds of enumeration" or the rest of that nonsense. 5) Wolfram mathworld - a legitimate reference written by people who have training, and which provides an enumeration function (something that doesn't make sense under your non-definition) - provides a function which explicitly disallows repetition. 6) Enumeration solves the enumeration problem, which is "counting all sets of solutions." Funny thing: if repetition is allowed, that isn't possible. Therefore enumeration's fundamental definition forbids the non-definition you got from your non-reference. 7) Even if this page supported the one thing you're trying to narrow this down to, every other thing you said was still wrong. 8) The thing this wikipedia page talks about - which isn't enumeration - also isn't even remotely similar to what the PHP library does, *or* to what your claims claim. 9) If the best you can do is a link to wikipedia which you obviously haven't read, then maybe it's time for you to find something else to do.
What? That's not how this is supposed to work, you're not supposed to be reasonable on the internet you fucking asshole faggot bitch cock sucker... ...ah screw it. Have a nice day. VIM FTW!
I really really did, I'm printing all those out for reading on a road trip this weekend. 
Honestly, the easiest way to figure out whether you're good enough for a PHP job is to pick a PHP project, build it, then to ask someone trusted whether it has security, stability or performance problems.
You've been coding for three years and all you do is screw around with OOP and other people's framework libraries? Try to branch out a little.
The very first piece of advice he gave was to store passwords encrypted, rather than hashed. This is a critical error.
&gt; To "go pro" you should definitely familiarize yourself with existing software like Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, etc He's trying to become a programmer, not an IT support staff member. &gt; It's also good to get into frameworks No. It isn't. &gt; Bottom line though, it sounds like you know how to program. No. It doesn't.
How so? I'm still at the nearly-flat part of the learning curve.
i love presentations by David Zülke! dude is awesome.
you could use microtime and time functions as a part of data generators
Well, if you really want to get knee-deep into the security aspect of web development, I'd also recommend that you check out the following: http://www.slideshare.net/joewalker/web-app-security?src=embed https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack http://shiflett.org/articles 
When evaluating estimates double the number and go up to the next unit of time. So, a 2 day project will most likely take 4 weeks.
That was more a general purpose complaint than anything else. If you want to use an array as an object set, you'd have to do array(STRING =&gt; OBJECT) where you have to manually and context-specifically determine what the string is (in this case, the enum identifier). In a more general sense, something like Java's Object.hashCode() would be incredibly useful for this sort of problem in PHP.
Except that he's not creating an enumeration of integers, he's creating an enumeration of objects, as is the case with Java enums - which is what he's stated to be the goal here. Java enum Objects are fully purposed Objects. That's what he's doing here, so defined() and an array won't work. EnumSet is a special purposed data structure that only allows objects in a specific enumeration to be added to it - it's not an enumeration itself.
&gt; The purpose of an enumeration is to provide a string label for an integer. That isn't what the PHP library does. No. That's *a* purpose of *some* implementations of enumerations. That's not the stated goal here at all. The purpose of Java enums, and I assume the purpose here as well, is to create a series of immutable, single-instance objects (which is extremely useful in an OOP language, a lot more than string labels for integers).
&gt; The very first piece of advice he gave was to store passwords encrypted Really? I thought bcrypt was still a hash, it just used a scheduling mechanism shared by blowfish. It is not encryption, persé. At least not insofar as a hash isn't considered encryption.
&gt; I've been working with PHP and MySQL for about 7+ years now Yet you say &gt; I'm afraid of getting rejected/ridiculed due to my lack of work experience
So instead of a forward slash I hit tab? I don't see the point.
Too overly complicated for a broad, but simple subject.
&gt; I thought bcrypt was still a hash Nope. &gt; It is not encryption, persé 1) Yes, it is. 2) Per se is two words that don't mean that. Are you drinking clamato?
Go waste someone else's time with your Herb Schildtery.
Go waste someone else's time with your Herb Schildtery.
The core difference between encryption and one-way hashing is that encryption is not one-way - that is, it can be reversed. You don't want anyone ever looking in there for any reason. Ever. Therefore, make it mathematically impossible. 
It looks good, I'd add something like fancybox or lightbox. Also a dynamic loading of other pages would be good. (ajax) An rss for new images (with a thumbnail in it) woud be good too.
&gt;&gt;I thought bcrypt was still a hash &gt;Nope. Can you explain this from the link then? &gt; bcrypt is an adaptive password hashing algorithm Or better yet... this from the paper the link cites &gt; We present two algorithms with adaptable cost--eksblowfish, a block cipher with a purposefully expensive key schedule, and bcrypt, a related hash function Or maybe we can focus on &gt; The very first piece of advice he gave was to store passwords encrypted What in your mind renders a hash to not be encryption? Seems to me hashing is a one-way form of encryption (ie, you can't decrypt) in the general sense of encryption. Or maybe you are using a particular technical definition. Can you point out which one you're using? Such that encryption excludes hashing, while at the same time includes bcrypt, which is a hash.
&gt; What in your mind renders a hash to not be encryption? Believe whatever you like, then. &gt; Or maybe you are using a particular technical definition. Yep. But, after that tone, I'm happy to leave you believing whatever you like. Good day, sir. Feel free to attempt to tell me that the reason I won't clarify isn't because of your tone, but rather because you imagine I don't have a point, and have never written code, and probably am a forever alone virgin who's never seen the sun, or whatever new rage fest will make you feel less bad that a nasty tone of voice cost you understanding your security basics. Don't worry, though: maybe some other proggitor will take the time to teach you to secure your stuff for free.
Is github a better solution than sourceforge and google code?
&gt; Yep. But, after that tone What tone? There are several technical definitions, each which given differing edge cases. I'm asking which one you're using. &gt; rather because you imagine I don't have a point Why make this personal? It was a technical thing. You were flat out wrong when you said that the guy's first suggestion was to use encryption, you further showed your wrongness by saying in another post that the difference between encryption and hashing was that hashing was one way. The implication is that you think you can reverse bcrypt's hash. You can't. So you're giving out bad advice by saying people should not be using bcrypt. Unless I'm missing something. What am I missing?
&gt; The very first piece of advice he gave was to store passwords encrypted, rather than hashed His first suggestion was to use bcrypt. &gt;The core difference between encryption and one-way hashing is that encryption is not one-way - that is, it can be reversed. You're implying here that bcrypt is reversible, since you've said bcrypt is encryption and not a hash. You're wrong. By those definitions, bcrypt is a hash. It is not reversible.
Why do you insist on being so obnoxious to everyone in this subreddit? 
Hmm, I had a ajax lightbox, but I decided to remove it, since I wouldent actually use it very much. The rss for new images is a good idea. I'll try to implement that. The thumbnailing might not come though since it has been by far the hardest part of this process. I need to find a better way to thumbnail these images. (using imagemagik now)
I keep asking myself the same question, and have given up. Thanks for taking the time to explaining the goal yet again, appreciate it.
Try to use GD library instead or to save thumbnails on disk so that they aren't being created every time they're required. I'm not sure that GD lib is better, but dynamic thumbnails creation is of course resource consuming.
Yeah, having less than zero knowledge of how a company like Google &amp; fb store/retrieve such large amounts of data, I found this entertaining and informative. 12TB a day? my god, that seems like something out of SCFI... 
&gt; Why make this personal? I walked away because of your tone. Now you want to tell me that I'm making it personal by supposing you'll ... have more tone. Which, of course, you insisted you wouldn't, but then did anyway. It's fascinating how people who are sure they're correct so often never even bother to check. &gt; You were flat out wrong Okay. :) Have fun building secure systems, guy. I'm very obviously not interested by your attempt to drag this conversation out to feel correct. &gt; The implication is that you think you can reverse bcrypt's hash. Funny how you're arguing with words I didn't say, yet if I point out that I didn't say them, you'll just demand a clarification of ... the conversation I'm not interested in. &gt; So you're giving out bad advice by saying people should not be using bcrypt. I never said people shouldn't use bcrypt either. I merely pointed out the error in the first article. I actually use bcrypt fairly frequently; I just use it for its real job. &gt; Unless I'm missing something. What am I missing? The ability to change the tone you think you don't have in order to get the information you want. It's sort of amazing to me how people like you never seem to be able to rein it in long enough to get the data you claim to be after - almost like it's just so you can tell yourself you tried and they didn't have an answer. Oh, and for reference? &gt; What tone? &gt; You were flat out wrong ... you further showed your wrongness ... The implication is that you think ... You can't ... unless I'm missing something. That's, admittedly, from this post rather than the previous, because it's so very obvious and I don't feel like getting the other one for you. (Not that it's hard, I just don't like it when people demand things in ugly tones from me.) That thing, where you get up on a post, preach at length about how correct you are, then add a footnote "Unless I'm missing something?" That's what cost you finding out what you're missing. Don't bother telling me that you don't agree that it's a nasty tone. It's not a point of agreement. You pissed me off, and by arguing it, you're pissing me off more. And if you don't like it? Fine. I really don't care. Go write software on a limited understanding of security, and pat yourself on the back for the argument you imagine you won. And if you want to learn what's wrong? Display more self awareness. Your call. If the next reply isn't a genuine apology, it's a waste of time.
Find someone else to talk to. I am not interested in your insults.
&gt; &gt; The very first piece of advice he gave was to store passwords encrypted, rather than hashed &gt; His first suggestion was to use bcrypt. Yep. &gt; You're implying here that bcrypt is reversible Jesus, it's boring watching someone go over the same text repeatedly, getting the same thing wrong repeatedly. &gt; By those definitions, bcrypt is a hash. Wow. By definitions you gave, claiming they were mine, the thing you said is the result. Clearly, you're a debatist. Is there a reason you keep replying to someone who said they were bored of your attitude, and were done discussing with you? Do you think repeating yourself is a form of proving someone else to be incorrect?
&gt;I never said people shouldn't use bcrypt either. I merely pointed out the error in the first article Let's look at the thread Nicoon's first suggestion was &gt;[How to safely store a password.](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) That is a link to bcrypt. Your first comment about it was the following &gt; This is a critical error This is an ambiguous sentence. I could mean "using bcrypt to safely store passwords" was the critical error. If this is the case, you're simply wrong, especially since you say you use it at well. If you really meant "bcrypt is a encryption, not a hash" as the critical error, then our discussion about vocabulary would be paramount. But I'd have expected that to be called out so we don't confuse the new guy there. Since it wasn't called out that we were just talking about vocabulary, I assumed we were still talking about the actual security part. If there's a third meaning, I'm not getting it. This is how I got to the part about you implying things. &gt;Display more self awareness. Can we take it down a notch or two please? There's no need for this. Tone doesn't always come across clearly, and there was non intended in either of the posts you referenced. The important thing here is the security. I think you're wrong. I explained how. You think I'm wrong. You have not explained how. Your original post was a terse "nope" without clarification, and all attempts past that have been met with hostility. I offered none. That you took some from my posts is unfortunate, but was not intended, nor was there. BCrypt stores passwords unreversibly. It is currently a good way to store passwords (or rather, hashed representation of passwords) Would you agree with that?
Not necessarily, but I know I would prefer it. I would prefer google code to sourceforge too.
&gt;Do you think repeating yourself is a form of proving someone else to be incorrect? This wasn't about trying to prove you wrong. It was about trying to get at what is right, even if I'm wrong. I'm sorry you're taking this so personally. If you would like to be done with this, feel free to do so. However, if you care to discuss the actual security issue involved let's restart: *BCrypt stores passwords unreversibly. It is currently a good way to store passwords (or rather, hashed representation of passwords)* Do you agree with the italicized text? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to safely store a password. &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a critical error &gt; &gt; You said people shouldn't use bcrypt &gt; I never said people shouldn't use bcrypt either. I merely pointed out the error in the first article This really isn't that difficult. "Hey, that hammer isn't for clearing drains." "YOU SAID HAMMERS ARE BAD TOOLS" No, what I said was "that isn't what that tool is for." It's not my fault your reading skills are so very poor that in your head, that turned into "that is a bad tool." &gt; This is an ambiguous sentence. Jesus, will you cut it out already? I am intentionally keeping as far away as I can from answers to you, JUST TO GET YOU TO STOP RESPONDING. I get it. You are desperate to be correct. You are combing over message after message, trying frantically to find just one legitimate error. You're not going to. Stop wasting my time trying. &gt; If you really meant "bcrypt is a encryption, not a hash" as the critical error I did not. Please stop trying to be an editor until you get some basic reading skills. &gt; If there's a third meaning, I'm not getting it. Obviously. &gt; This is how I got to the part about you implying things. The part where I'm implying things is the fault of your being unable to read a simple literal sentence for its simple literal content, and instead start desperately injecting incorrect meanings into it in the attempt to create an error. Which, somehow, you see as my fault. What I actually said, again, was "using that tool for that incorrect job is a critical error." You can spend all day trying to read new meanings into that, and then telling me that the new meaning that you've recently invented, which is different than your last wrong criticism, is again somehow my error, even though I never actually said it. And each time I will say the same thing. "That's also not what I said. Please stop bothering me." And it appears that each time, you respond again with a new hilarious misread of what was said, and an even angrier proclamation of your correctness. I was wondering. Do you think if I just bought you a coatrack, a big coat, and a sign that said "StoneCypher," that you could argue with that instead? It's pretty clear that I don't actually need to participate in your little tirade here. &gt; Would you agree with that? I have no intention of engaging you in any question you ask. I have, now eleven times, told you that I do not want to have a conversation with you, because I find you unpleasant. At no point have you actually figured out what that means.
&gt;What I actually said, again, was "using that tool for that incorrect job is a critical error." OK... The tool involved was BCrypt. The job was "Storing passwords safely". Why is that a critical error?
Yeah, right now once they thumbnail, the file saves in a thumbnail directory, though I have 16 images needing to thumbnail a page. So the first time I do this, there will be a lot of server load. My host already got mad at me for increasing the load a lot.
Three more posts since the last time I quoted one of your questions and said "in the effort to get you to go away, I will not answer you." You really do struggle with being told "go away," don't you?

As much as it's probably suicide in here to say so... PHP is absolutely the wrong tool for the data processing job, especially large data processing. PHP's runtime being as inefficient and slow as it is doesn't usually matter, but for "large scale data processing," it most certainly is enough of a reason to not use PHP and use, say, Java instead (Java is actually quite good / the best at this sort of thing).
Thank you, this is also very useful for me. 
Just create model classes for the other records, just as you did with the Users object, then add those models to the user. Ex: // $england and $germany are of type Application_Model_Countries $user-&gt;addCountry($england); $user-&gt;addCountry($germany); When saving the user object in the mapper, retrieve the objects representing the records in the other tables and store them as well. ex: //.... foreach ($user-&gt;getCountries() as $country) { if (null === ($id = $country-&gt;getId())) { //New record, insert. } else { //Existing record, update. } }
Know that however long you think it'll take you're wrong. Triple that bitch. For example, your programmer says something'll take 4 hours mark it down as 12. You're welcome. 
thanks @Nicoon, however I think I might have to do some inner joins somewhere since so far I have 3 tables(users, paises and users_has_paises). I'm just trying to figure the SQL statement right now then I'll do something as you suggested but I'm kind of stuck... if I do somethign like: SELECT pais.pais AS pais FROM users INNER JOIN users_has_pais on users_has_pais.users_id = users_id INNER JOIN pais ON pais.id = users_has_pais.pais_id WHERE users.id = 100 which,...I thought should retrieve the country records for the user with id = 100... but that's hardly the case and this returns all the records. Any ideas on what could I be missing here?
Why aren't you using Zend_Db_Table for retrieving and setting the data? It has [mechanisms for handling this stuff](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.relationships.html#zend.db.table.relationships.fetching.many-to-many) for you.
wow...I'm checking this right now thanks... I'm gonna have to learn to use doctrine and save myself from a lot of headaches at some point though, lol. And the sql query I need to get there now is: SELECT pais FROM pais LEFT OUTER JOIN users_has_pais ON pais.id = users_has_pais.pais_id WHERE users_has_pais.users_id = 100
So, you've done research in computational mathematics, and you think that means you're ready to be a project manager, which is a college track, for software development, another college track, in a language you don't speak, having never taken any computer science. &gt; I'm going to be managing a team of programmers. Not very well. Turns out you can't just read two or three books and suddenly have the wealth of experience it takes to not be a clueless manager. &gt; and how can I do a good job? By going to upper management and saying "I need to be trained as a project manager; please get me PMBOK training." Or, y'know, hanging a bunch of people's jobs on the belief that you can have an 80s montage, do a few dozen hours of work, and suddenly succeed at a job that industry insiders are famous for getting wrong. But yeah, we can just slide right through this on a couple books and "learning a significant amount of PHP." Hey, I learned the Greek Alphabet. Where do I get started on deep multivariate statistical analysis of medical records? Good luck, Chuck.
And this is why you aren't a software manager. 
&gt; We use Git now, do you suggest sticking with this? Yeah. You're not ready for management. You're asking strangers in public whether you should ditch your toolchain just because someone mentioned a tool. That's classic pointy haired behavior. Just hand the reins over to your developers. They don't want to be managed by whoever you're talking to on Reddit this week.
Just add a call to your countries in the foreach, and set the value according to what your countries model returns. $entry-&gt;setCountry=$modelCountries-&gt;getCountry($row-&gt;country) Something like that?
&gt; You don't need to know fucking anything if you have hired good people. I have seen so many shops fail because of this false assertion. It is very easy and very common for excellent teams to fail because of clueless management. &gt; In short, you are not particularly relevant to the success or failure of the project. Well, PMBOK, RAND, Schlumberger, PSP/TSP, COCOMO and so on say that this isn't correct. But what to actual studies with actual numbers know, anyway? This is, after all, why the best companies ditch all management and let their staff do whatever they want. After all, why would they spend 30% of their salary block on staff who aren't relevant? This is just a bunch of vague claims.
mmm right now I'm actually trying to make this SQL statement work: SELECT pais FROM pais LEFT OUTER JOIN users_has_pais ON pais.id = users_has_pais.pais_id WHERE users_has_pais.users_id = ? but the documentation for that is kind of...well, [weird](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html). I'm trying...but I really don't know what to do: $paisInstance = new Model_UsersHasPais(); $resultSetPais = $paisInstance-&gt;select() -&gt;from('pais') -&gt;joinLeft(array( 'users_has_pais', 'pais' )) 
Please go learn the basics of php/mysql and html/javascript before you continue. Doing so without fundamental knowledge is going to leave your site full of vulnerabilities.
I appreciate the advice, but that doesn't really help me with my issue. I took two web development classes in college, where we covered php mysql html and javascript, but (as you said) at a basic level. I've put all this together myself, and I've reviewed the login/redirect script, and it seems to work well for many people. On the other hand however, This isn't going to be the most sensitive data in the world. It's simply an in/out timesheet for my employees. That's it. The only other thing on our website is, well, our website, which is purely informational, and I have a copy on my flash drive. Not a biggy. I just wondered if anyone knew a better way of formatting php to allow me to get the task done, or if anyone knew of a better login script/solution. Thanks!
All you have to do is rename your .html files to end with .php and they will be parsed by the PHP interpreter, then output to the browser as HTML. (then you can add your login code to the top of the file and it will work) You might be better off buying a 3rd party timesheet/timeclock web service; if you don't know about simple PHP/HTML principles, you might make a mistake and end up messing up the timesheet data or losing data (which is pretty important considering your employees are paid based on this!). Google shows a lot of different services so there is probably a good+cheap one out there that will meet your needs.
I actually meant it more as a literal statement. There are almost no downsides to developing locally and plenty of technical, psychological, and organizational benefits. I mentioned many of them in my reply to BTMPL. The organizational reasons become even more important as the importance of the project or the size of the team increases. If the OP wants to work with professional, qualified people (read: $$$), he is better off getting into the habit of developing locally (or at a minimum, in a per-developer sandboxed environment on a remote server, but I really have no idea what that buys you).
I did do exactly what you said (as I mentioned in the post) but anything outside php tags gets displayed on the site and doesn't redirect the individual to the "access denied" page if they just type in the url. It's like it circumvents the authorization process. If I put the html in with echo's, it works just fine - I dont get any unauthorized access. Again, I appreciate your suggestion to paying for a service like this, but I've already looked into it. I'd like to do this on my own and I wont implement it until I'm certain that it's secure/reliable/back-upable. I'd just like someone to give me some advice about how to format a php page so that it isn't such a bother. The pages aren't going to be super complex. I just want to know if anyone knows a better way to format html in php pages. 
I downloaded the script you linked to and looked at it. Are you including the following code in the header like they say? this is the end of their snippet: //this is group name or username of the group or person that you wish to allow access to // - please be advise that the Administrators Groups has access to all pages. if (allow_access(Administrators) != "yes") { //this should the the absolute path to the no_access.html file - see above include ('no_access.html'); exit; } If this code is appearing before any of your HTML, then it will exit and none of the HTML will be printed, unless this Login&amp;Redirect script doesn't work like the docs say. Calling exit stops the script from processing any more of the file. EDIT: If you are still having trouble try copying one of the supposed-to-be-protected files that is NOT working for you into pastebin or something and post the link here.
That's because he's a troll and a obnoxious cunt. His purpose in life is to be a complete douche to everyone and try and prove his superiority over others. He will bait you into long-winded discussions about nothing where he nitpicks and tries to prove that his English is better than yours. He'll whine that you're bothering him and he'll ask you to leave him alone while responding to all your posts. He's remarkably predictable, if anything. Ignore him for the cunt that he his.
it's only suicide to say so because you didn't back that up with any facts or citations. how about some numbers or specificity to your claims?
Ignore StoneCypher. He's a pathetic shit without a life who resorts to trolling and generically behaving like an all-round cunt to prove his superiority over others (to himself). This is pretty much how he behaves most of the time.
^ This. There's no reason for this kind of shitty behavior. What a douche.
it should look more like: ` $resultSetPais = $paisInstance-&gt;select() -&gt;setIntegrityCheck(false) -&gt;from(array('p' =&gt; 'pais')) -&gt;joinLeft( array('u' =&gt; 'users_has_pais'), 'p.id = u.id' )) -&gt;where() `

html files usually don't run php.. you'll probably want a general header include that does the check and redirects.. don't forget the die() after header()
Facebook uses PHP. Look at the URLs next time you're on there.
Does anyone know if there happens to be a video of this presentation?
It breaks my heart daily because they don't support ftps.
I know - I'm a phpED refugee and there's a lot of netbeans things that take some getting used to.
The general sluggishness, inability to highlight word blocks, and poor Mercurial integration make me rage daily. If anyone is looking at alternatives... [PHP IDEs](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/c0652/whats_the_best_ide_to_use_for_php_development/) and [Stackoverflow Questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php+ide?sort=votes&amp;pagesize=30) Give me Aptana with Netbeans code completion and good Mercurial integration and I would be a happy man. 
Netbeans' code completion gets in my way more often than not. Especially when it tries to add braces and brackets for no apparent reason. Meh.
Fair enough... There's several reasons people don't suggest doing heavy things with PHP: 1. There's no threads, even faux threads a la Python, which makes parallelizing any sort of data processing... impossible. There's a lot of algorithms that this excludes, as well as meaning that (for, say, hadoop) to take advantage of 100,000 cores your job has to be broken into 100,000 tasks instead of 25,000 or 12,500 for a parallel algorithm (assuming 4 or 8 cores per node, respectively). This has a cascading effect because decreasing the number of map tasks means you emit smaller amounts of data to the reduce tasks. 2. PHP has, by far, the worst managed (in terms of runtime performance and memory usage) runtime of popular languages. Some benchmarks: * http://hentenaar.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/27-Benchmark-PHP-vs.-Python-vs.-Perl-vs.-Ruby.html * http://blog.famzah.net/2010/07/01/cpp-vs-python-vs-perl-vs-php-performance-benchmark/ * http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/2008/07/performance-comparison-c-java-python-ruby-jython-jruby-groovy/ And of course there's shootout micro benchmarks, in which PHP is almost always slower and uses more memory than the competition: * PHP v. JS (v8, say node.js): http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=v8&amp;lang2=php * PHP v. Perl http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=perl&amp;lang2=php * PHP v. Python http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=python3&amp;lang2=php * PHP v. Ruby http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=yarv&amp;lang2=php * PHP v. Java http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=java&amp;lang2=php 3. PHP has an incredibly rudimentary and basic stop-the-word garbage collector (as well as having a not-that-great OS memory allocation strategy) which makes it inherently much worse for memory intensive, long-running applications (basically anything that could run long enough to trigger garbage collection pauses) than a runtime with good garbage collection, like the JVM or even Mono. Data processing tasks aren't disposable processes that can be ejected after a few hundred milliseconds - they often have to run for hours at a time. As anyone who's worked with data intensive processing on a managed runtime will tell you, garbage collection times are a huge deal. Having a parallel, concurrent garbage collector can mean as much as doubling the throughput of your application. 4. PHP's compiler is non-optimizing. This isn't a huge deal, but it makes a pretty solid difference in how one must write code if they need to write something performance intensive, like crunching giant piles of data. PHP is a great language for tiny websites, but where heavy lifting has to be done, it's not even a contender. And in all the cases that people love to use to proclaim PHP's greatness (Facebook, Yahoo!, Digg, etc.) all make extensive use of tools written in other languages to do their heavy lifting, most usually hadoop, Lucene, and/or Cassandra. Once you step outside of having simple CRUD web sites and you have to start doing computationally expensive and peculiar things with your data, PHP starts falling apart in terms of practicality.
Please refer to my reply [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hjs0f/large_scale_data_processing_with_hadoop_and_php/c1w2hy1) in this thread. 
Use PHPStorm.
Just let somebody know that it seems like another developer should join the project; to make sure things get done on time. Also, if the client makes a major change, that should push the deadline back.
1.) Be up front if you're having problems. *Don't wait for a deadline that you know you're going to miss.* 2.) Be specific about what the problems are. *Don't just say you're having problems with the whole project. Isolate the specific parts that are giving you trouble and be ready to discuss what you've already tried to remedy the problems.* 3.) Tell them what you (think you) need to fix the problem. *This one is tricky because you may not understand the problems well enough to know what will fix them. But you should try to give them some idea of what you need to fix this. Do you need more time? Another dev? Some other resource? There's no guarantee they'll give you what you ask for, but you can at least try to propose a solution.*
I do it by hand. Gedit 4 life
Thanks for the effort. Yes, I've tried it several different ways actually with this script. But for whatever reason - with every browser that I had to test it with - the darn thing would simply read out everything after the php tags. Even if you just went directly to the url. My guess is that it's either a bug, Or I've done something wrong repeatedly (I deleted, and reinstalled this script a couple times). So I think I'll just look for something else I suppose. Thanks for your help though!
cool, sorry I couldn't be of more help. good luck finding a solution!
Yeah but when you SSH into a Linux environment it's exactly the same as sitting in front of the Linux server its self, only difference is you have to be connected to the internet. You have full control of the server to configure PHP and install any programs you want. I work on a mac, but SSH into a shared development server and code in VIM directly on the dev server, then we commit files from the dev server to production when changes are ready. We only have 2 people including myself that work on that dev server so we don't have to worry much about overwriting each other's work, but we still have to utilize version control software to move stuff between dev and production. Anyway, I guess the point is that a remote desktop is just as good as a "real" desktop, at least if you're coding in a Linux environment, what's important is that you need to learn how to work with a team and use version control software.
I'm not a ZCE, so I guess it isn't relevant to me, but why does www.PHPExperts.pro show up as a blank template site? I remember seeing something about it a few months ago and it still looks the same, I think. Wouldn't a spartan placeholder page look better than what's there currently?
+1 I wish mutli alignment would just work..... :-(
thanks for the thoughtful response. i'll look this over in more detail later. :)
PHPStorm is definitely the best imo. PHP editors have sucked so bad for years, PHPStorm is finally one I can use without becoming totally homicidal.
NetBeans used to break my heart daily in so many different ways. Then I switched to SlickEdit. Yeah, it costs a lot of money -- because it works and doesn't piss me off nearly as often.
Also, make the delays known immediately, and overestimate every time. It discourages scope-creep.
It's open source, why don't you have a crack at fixing it ??
I bought PHPStorm during their latest half price sale and am loving it. If anyone on here is considering it, they offer it for half-price at least a couple of times a year so keep an eye out and you can get it for $49.
OK Honestly? What the heck does NetBeans have over PHPed? I can name MANY things PHPed has over NetBeans, including substantially less memory and CPU requirements, C++ vs Java based (much speedier), and a FAR nicer debugger (nusphere's debugger vs xdebug), and an exceptional profiler.
You also program at a very reduced rate compared to people of equal skill using any PHP IDE.
OK, but you wouldn't understand the code if you tried, so why do you expect anyone else to?
OK, SlickEdit has a few of the features any decent IDE does, but it is lacking all of the major must have features.
What features are you missing? I haven't missed anything so far. It has the number one feature I'm looking for: stable, understanding interface for xdebug.
If only it would be that easy.
we'll call it PHaPBeans
Updates are glacial and support seems to be handled by one guy on the forums, there's no way to extend the IDE and add your own plugins, my final straw was when i was getting regular lockups in the IDE and cryptic error messages, decided to try out some of the more active IDEs out there
I thought programmers liked a challenge? What makes you so sure I wouldn't understand the code? 
Give them a small take home assignment (build some kind of system) then go for the people with the best code to progress further to second interview.
Doesn't seem to work properly for me!
How about problems/bugs that have come up in the past for applications? You could even do what Dilbert did - ask interviewers to fix current bugs :P
I like this, and it's very telling about someone's skills. Being able to write code is great, but if you can't debug it, you don't belong on my team. (Unless we're looking for a jr. developer... maybe.)
Also multiline search/replace. I know I can do it with regexp, but I'd rather select a multiline block and find/replace that block in multiple files. (This is one feature of Dreamweaver I miss since switching to Netbeans)
I'm currently using the trial for ZendStudio and it's pretty good
&gt; Liar. &gt; bad hehavior &gt; your character. Your delusions.
In my old company we gave interviewees a short exam. I would sit with them as they did the test and they'd talk out loud their though process and answers. It was not so much the answer they give but to see how go about solving problems.
If your just looking for questions, have a look at the Zend PHP5 certification exam: http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/
WOW is it me or does Zend make this extremely overly complicated?
It's more that he doesn't seem to be aware that I was questioning. Rather than "... for diff folks" I would have said "... for different projects". ORM is awesome sometimes, not so great others. Full blown IDE is cumbersome sometimes, but a godsend others. But you can't know that if you haven't taken an interest.
We're in the process of hiring and we had a questionnaire, CVs et al, but the thing that really told us about how the candidate worked was **sample code**. Of the 3 candidates we had shortlisted, *none* of them bothered to escape user inputs in their sample code, amongst many other glaring errors. All instant no-nos. Scary thing is this code is in projects that are out in the open right now. This obviously works better if you are a pretty competent developer yourself, and know the donny-dos and donny-don'ts.
the best interview process which i saw so far was when company asked for zipped source code of candidate's biggest project and let their developers examine it. you can fake sample code and do it properly, but when you show them half year of work, they will see .. they eliminated about 98% of applicants this way 
Search sucks in PHPeD. I moved away because of that evil search modal they force on you :( Shame, it's easier to fix all the bugs in netbeans than to fix one bug in PhpEd :( such a shame, I've moved jobs a number of times and bought loads of copies (for each new team) of it.
yep and doing: ( something () then typing another ) seems to confuse it a lot :(
lol so true
It also offers the applicant the possibility to see what mess he will get into. ;-)
What advantage do you feel you get from programming directly on a remote (development) server rather than locally? I guess that's the issue I'm getting stuck with. I see downsides, but I just don't see any tangible benefits. I'm obviously missing something; I feel like I'm on the wrong side of this issue.
&gt; This obviously works better if you are a pretty competent developer yourself, and know the donny-dos and donny-don'ts. In my opinion, if you are a competent developer, you should be able to sit down with someone and talk about anything related to his past projects to get a feeling of how competent he is.
I think the point of this discussion is to judge a candidates competence before investing the time/money to interview them personally.
I ended up solving it with this: $instance = Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::getDefaultAdapter(); $pais = $instance-&gt;select(); $pais-&gt;from(array('p' =&gt; 'pais'), array('p.pais') ) -&gt;join( 'users_has_pais', 'p.id = users_has_pais.pais_id' ) -&gt;where( 'users_has_pais.users_id = ?', $row-&gt;id ); $paisEntry = $instance-&gt;fetchCol($pais);
hmm... makes sense, never mind then. ;-)
Two issues with this - 1) you don't know if they actually wrote it, or which parts, assuming they were on a team developing this project 2) if their biggest project was for another company (likely if they're an experienced developer), in all likelihood they can't actually give you the source due to NDA restrictions - and if they do I'm immediately going to question if they'll do the same when they leave my company.
Some people use the Programmer Competency Matrix as a starting point for creating them. http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm
It's out of date, but could be a starting point for you... http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/8c6gy/can_you_suggest_good_interview_questions_for_php/
&gt;The thing is...I cannot simply pass it to the view like this: Actually, you can. They're just objects holding the data, nothing more. They are therefore perfectly suitable for passing to the view. &gt;How do you guys process these kind of objects in the views/controllers Something like this: &lt;table&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Users&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Role&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;?php if (count($this-&gt;show) == 0): ?&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="2"&gt;No results&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php endif; ?&gt; &lt;?php foreach ($this-&gt;show as $user): ?&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $user-&gt;getUsername(); ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $user-&gt;getRole(); ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; Or you could grab ZFDataGrid, if you want a sortable, filterable table. 
http://www.codility.com It's nice but beware: the questions are difficult.
mmm...interesting...you always help me Nicoon, you're earning yourself a fruit basket. I'll check more of this ZFDataGrid
Don't worry, I'll send you a bill later ;)
Test for everyday situations - recursion, working with date, working with remote sources. Ask them to provide you with sample of their past work so you can take a look at it while they are working on your test. Don't forget about [FizzBuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html).
Absolutely adore PhpStorm. Everything about it simply... works.
Trying this now ... it had best not disappoint me.
Maybe doesn't apply to you, but this is /PHP/, not /Java/
I don't mean to be an asshole, but you're asking quite a few ZF questions lately in this /r/. Maybe you should read through the official docs (they're pretty thorough, if a little... boring), or switch to a different framework that makes more sense? I recommend Kohana :)
no prob...I'm having problems to get myself started with zend,...that's true, but as far as I know Kohana's docs are pretty much non existing. Besides I like Zend...I just need to ask stuff to get me on my two feet in the beginning. You have to understand that this is my first zend framework project,...which up until a couple of days I was doing only with the help of a book which I have now learn (from what other zf users have told me) that sucks. Sorry if my questions seem too stupid to you.
Fizz buzz ftw. 
That is pretty cool, thanks for the good link.
I never said there are any advantages, just that it's more or less the same thing as developing locally. I'm not trying to say that it's better or worse, just that "learn to develop locally" isn't really important, what's important is that you know how to not only write code, but also manage PHP and your databases, use version control software, and all that stuff that you don't necessarily have control over if you're just coding in Dreamweaver or whatever it is people use these days and constantly just upload files to some server you can't control via FTP. For me, I didn't have any experience with Linux when I started my job, and originally I was just using Dreamweaver to code and upload with FTP. The only real reason I started coding directly on the dev server through SSH was because I needed to become more familiar with Linux and basic server administration tasks.
This is the way to go about it. Without a doubt, code quality is important, but Google is a developers best resource and it gets used frequently. You can't do this in an interview so the key is to understand how they approach a problem rather than whether they've memorized the functions to achieve it.
Sure. Grain of salt, as with anything.
I'm not saying some elaborate system they can actually use to pillage your code and get free work done for them. Just some problem that can be done in a few hours so they can see your coding style and ability. If they were getting work done for free that would be highly unethical and I would be quite pissed off if I was a candidate. At any rate it's better than being on their site given a coding test/told to build a system under time and pressure constraints without your usual development environment or even a working internet connection.
Cool. Thanks for the reply. I know you didn't ask for advice, but I'm going to give it anyways. Try Netbeans + xdebug + jVi (or viex - both are VIM plugins) on a project running locally. It's very much worth your time.
Highly unethical. If you're getting people to do real work for you, you should be paying them. If some company asked me to do that, then I found out later I was doing their work for them for free I would be pretty mad. Fixing old bugs is ok though as it's of limited use to the company now except to see if the candidate can do it.
Not to mention if I gave away all the source code to my project, business or site what's stopping them from stealing it and using it themselves. Would never do that in a million years.
I'm using it more for personal uses. I know my weaknesses, but this has helped me to more specifically define them. It's also given me a vague direction of where I should focus my energy to improve those areas.
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $user-&gt;getUsername() ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $user-&gt;getRole() ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; Short tags for the win. The only reason they're not recommended is that they confuse XML parsers... but when was the last time anyone fed php templates through an XML parser? BTW: seeing that you're using alternative syntax: http://blogs.oracle.com/netbeansphp/entry/highlighting_of_alternative_syntax
I think I read you or somebody else talking about how awesome that combination is and I definitely want to try it out. I wouldn't be able to use that with my existing code on our dev server thought would I? At least, not without transferring a whole buttload of files over to my local machine, right?
sorry i forget to mention that they asked for biggest project which have they coded on their own = no team work, just their own project, ( most probably free time, lot of developers tend to have that kind of stuff ).. thats for the NDA. but there is no protection from stealing, if they would submit stolen code, nobody would know .. but i guess its same with samples. 
&gt;Short tags for the win. Short tags are sometimes disabled on the host, and to maximize portability, it is better to write the tags in its full form. &gt;The only reason they're not recommended is that they confuse XML parsers. It's not the only reason. The PHP parser also confuses XML tags with PHP tags, leading to errors if you're working with PHP in XML documents. &gt;seeing that you're using alternative syntax Well, the alternative PHP syntax is the recommended syntax to use within view files. 
Far out, would take me at least 10minutes to understand the demo task and figure out the maths let alone code the rest of it with no way to test it in 20mins.
well, if it is open source then .. 
Sure no problem.
Oh! Then I have a very different recommendation. :) More information -&gt; better suggestions. http://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/ Yes, it's for the wrong language. Most of them are still good brain food. Also, look, in my opinion, the best thing a programmer can do to stretch their mind is to learn a language that's very, very different than any of the ones they already know.
&gt; Also, look, in my opinion, the best thing a programmer can do to stretch their mind is to learn a language that's very, very different than any of the ones they already know. Good point. Going from OOP to functional, interpreted to compiled, etc. always makes me rethink what I know.
I don't think he's saying you're having stupid questions, just more that you should be trying trial by fire. A lot of people here learned PHP the old fashion way, putting your head down and running into it. Don't feel bad asking questions, I wish I had had a good place to as for help me when I first started. However, don't be afraid to try a way off the beaten path. Maybe your way is better than what other people have thought up. Never know.
Then multiple people may have worked on it.
is there anyway to see any of the exam without paying for it?
What drives me nuts is that I honestly don't have that much code that's not under some sort of disclosure agreement (I've worked mostly in Healthcare, clinical trials, and medical research and they are *crazy* about NDAs.) so what I do have is stuff I've written specifically for this situation, but it's not that much. Some of my code is even protected by law. In my opinion, you are filtering out some of the people who actually know what they are doing. 
It is easier to set up debugging when running locally. So, in that case, you would need to move your project and it's files to your local machine. You already mentioned you have them in whatever version control system you are using, just check out your project on your machine. I really doubt your project is larger than 50 megabytes unless you have a lot of sample sounds or videos. Grab a copy of your prod database and import it to a localhost version. The only thing that might get tricky is if you have tons of user generated assets like profile images or photo uploads or whatever - but you already deal with that same issue between your shared dev server and your prod server, so I assume you have an easy way to deal with it. If setting up a project locally is a major problem - you probably did something quite badly. You should be able to move projects to new environments, be it dev, stage, prod, or a new server with relative ease. That said, you can continue developing on the dev server if you insist, as Netbeans has SFTP support. xdebug needs to be installed on the dev server, configured, and you need to make sure the port it connects on isn't firewalled. This will probably take you a day or three to completely wrap your head around it - but programming efficiency - especially when something really WTF happens or you are working on someone else's shitty code, should go through the roof. Imagine stepping through each line of code and having a var_dump or print_r for every array, object, variable, whatever. Being able to see exactly what the $_GET array holds. Checking what's in the session. All the time, line by line, without any horrible echos littering your code. Imagine being able to profile for speed instantly to check what functions or queries take a long time.
The description doesn't make much sense, do you have an example for us? Also, 4000 records isn't much, and if you write the script correctly, parsing 1 shouldn't be any harder than parsing 4000.
&gt; all the source code You don't. People usually ask for a sample of your code, not the whole codebase.
&gt;I just need to ask stuff to get me on my two feet in the beginning. Zend Framework does indeed have a steep learning curve. However, once you've gotten the hang of how things work, it gets a lot easier for you. &gt;which up until a couple of days I was doing only with the help of a book which I have now learn (from what other zf users have told me) that sucks. The best way to learn how to code in Zend Framework in the manner it was intended is to read from the official docs. The [reference guide](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/) is an excellent source of information. It has plenty of code snippets from which you can learn from. The [quick start](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.intro.html) has an example project which should give you a rough idea about how the whole thing fits together. And the [API documentation](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.11/) will give you a complete overview over the various classes and their methods, if you need it. 
Just updated my post with a sample, I hope it helps you understand! Thanks
well you know...each person is a world when it comes to learning stuff. To me, it helps me to ask someone who knows more than me, and then to try to explain what I've learned to someone who knows less. Reading the docs is quite helpful,...but when you're just starting off...frankly sometimes you don't even know what you're looking for or how to look for it. For me it's even harder because English is not my first language, so a couple of weeks ago I didn't even know what "render" meant...and the help I might get in spanish sucks... seriously,...all I find is code at least 5 years old in forums which won't let you even format it so its harder to read.Up until now...everything I didn't know and I asked for, whether its in here, in #zftalk or stackoverflow ...I got an answer (even when it might have taken me a whole day), or at least I got pointed in the right path.
=) Thanks a lot, again. And you're right about it being much easier once you've learned a couple of things. The "convention over configuration" paradigm really makes things a lot easier here.
I'm going to try to get this set up and slowly move files from dev to my machine as I need them, because we have a huuuuuuuuuuuge amount of code. Also, we use CVS to move files from dev to production, but other than basic committing and updating of files I'm not too handy with it so I'll have to do a lot of googling to figure out how to set it up to transfer my local files to dev. Anyway, sounds like a really fantastic way to code, but I'm going to have to do a lot of learning to get it set up properly. Thanks for the project though, I always like learning new stuff. **edit**: Derp, I just read your paragraph about netbeans having SFTP, I just need to install xedebug on our dev server. I'll start with that and for my own personal projects I'll start coding locally.
Also, we're really keen on getting feedback on our concept, so if you have any comments or suggestions, please let us know.
Not working in Chrome 11.0.696.68 EDIT: Not working with ABP running in Chrome 11.0.696.68. The intermediate page doesn't even show.
You need to do some pattern matching with LIKE. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/pattern-matching.html I'm assuming you're using MySQL, but most DB types have something similar.
Yes, with ABP we skip the ad completely, better that than showing them a blank page with a box in it. It should take you back to the original site - did it?
I'm sure this is quite impressive and I'm sure you put a lot of time and effort into it, but fuck everything about this.
Sounds like a plan. It might make sense to play with a small localhost based project for a while using the Netbeans + xdebug combo and see if you like it while you continue working on your existing big project with SSH + VIM as you have been. Less initial trauma (it's quite confusing to get it first setup and working), and no decrease in productivity where it actually matters. One extra hint - get a browser extension for xdebug (for chrome, use "xdebug helper", for firefox, use "easy Xdebug") I'd be shocked if you weren't making arrangements to get your big project migrated over within a month. Also... CVS? Do yourself a MAJOR favor and switch to git + github or mercurial + bitbucket (at least for new projects). I would probably cry if someone made me go back to CVS, or hell, even SVN.
It took me to the site that I'm sure was the destination, but I can't really see the value here for advertisers or the sites that run this. The market is already flooded with advertising solutions that are defeated by ABP, including full page redirection ads (i.e. ign.com). If a visitor clicks to close the ad out of habit then wants to look at it later there is no way to back. Persistent page ads (no flash/animation) are still king in this market since they actually have a chance for conversion. EDIT: So this is going to be done by the site the visitor is exiting and not the destination? If so, it would seem to unfairly push the onus for the ad on the destination site and is extremely poor practice.
There is nothing novel, innovative or cool about this. It's obnoxious and stupid and a terrible idea. Also I'm tired of seeing you posting about this shit on reddit. Fuck off.
100% Agree. Whenever I've had to provide code examples it's been a struggle and I've had to give them shit I knew wasn't my best because it was from when I was in college ... so like 7 years ago. 
Why take home? Give them a real problem you're having and have them fix it. That's what's been done with me most of the time.
WHERE items='Scissors' returns 2nd row only WHERE items LIKE '%Scissors%' returns any row with the word "scissors" WHERE items LIKE '%Scissors' returns any row that ends in scissors WHERE items LIKE 'Scissors%' returns any row that starts in scissors
You almost certainly want to keep the data in 2 tables. Then, if you search for 1 term, you'll have to use a COUNT to see how many rows in your second table have ID 12ACB (to make sure there is only 1 row) and if you search for more than 1 term, you can ignore that and just grab all the DISTINCT IDs with those terms. This, by the way, is called database normalization. It is possible to keep your data in 1 table and do something using the LIKE clause, but splitting it up will most likely save your work down the road **when** your requirements change.
Wow, adverts when you *leave* a website. I really hope this doesn't catch on!
This is the way to go, friend. Listen to this man. EDIT: If the same items are used in multiple "packages" (I dunno what you wanna call them) then that is a many-to-many relationship. To do this you should use 3 tables. Example: * Package (**id**, name) * PackageItem (**package_id**, **item_id**) * Item (**id**, name) Then you would use a couple of joins in the select query.
the secret... is that you're kind of a dick. i probably know double what you know, and am making fuck all. but i've stuck with the companies that i've liked, rather than shifting every 6 months to somewhere that offers me more money. you really lose all sense of self and integrity by switching companies. good luck getting that back.
Well, maybe i didn't explain it well. Some records have: Item=Scissors, Tape, Cable Others have Tape, Scissors So it can't be with a wildcard, the data is not stable right now, also as stated, i want records that match the items i give, ex: Tape + Scissors, if there's anything else, i don't want a match. (Also, the data isn't consistent, there can be "-" or "/" on some fields, but nothing more than a space in others)
Yes, i realized this was the "proper" way, but wanted to know if there was an alternative using FULL TEXT or Lucene or something like that. I'll have my main table, and then the item's table, and one that manages relations, as you said, it's a many to many relationship. Thanks for your time!
Yes, i know, I just got the data (it was in excel) and wanted to know how to proceed best, obviously this is it, but you know, "normalizing" 4500 rows that have 5-25 different items on that field, it's gonna take some time, just trying to find out if there was an alternative. BTW, i tried to make a script to extract all those different "items" and failed, it's so bad that a lot of words are not correctly spaced, so it's going to be fun time. Thanks!
[Google Refine is a power tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from one format into another](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/)
The issue, besides searching, you're going to have with full text is it's speed. It's terribly slow. Using the multiple tables it will be much faster, especially if you make "name" a key that is indexed as well, with unique rather than full text.
afaik in the example link given (/similar addons for browsers) the client requests the data, without using your api keys or anything like that, so only the client's ip will be banned if they do too many requests. (try turning on those toolbars and setting them to request google index/google backlinks/etc on every page load...doesn't take too long until you have to prove you're not a bot...)
This doesn't have anything to do with PHP, and is a question better suited for one of the general programming subreddits. &gt;I'm trying to figure out how something like this is developed: Read the documentation on how to develop an extension: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions &gt;I can hit the APIs for the services that have them available, but if I'm going to release it to the public, wouldn't I hit the query limit on those APIs pretty quick? Surely, the limit applies per user, not per API key. 
look into the mozilla projects there is one for easy addon creation. called JET or something. ill add link when back at my desk.
Referring to [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/tools/builder)?
If your company already does PHP stuff, then why not create your own, and tailor it to the type of work you do? For extra points, leave vulnerabilities in your code, and extra points to those that find them.
I know. I tried, i miserably failed at it. :( 
lol... no need to get pissy... upvoting because of hilarity, but seriousness aside, there have been studies done at google/facebook and such that show that good project managers don't necessarily need to know the programming languages their subordinates are using. that said, i'm a programmer, and don't really care for managing shit... ... though, [the mythical man month](http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) is an amazing book ...
yeap,...I recently got asked to write a WP plugin that would allow the user to connect to his vimeo account and choose which of the videos to display in his website... C'mon man,... you don't need me to do all that shit to know whether I can write a damn plugin or not. Do you want me to design a free theme too just to make sure? 
You mean it actually supports debugging and breakpoints? I didn't see that ANYWHERE on their site.
Ramen!
Your post needs to be deleted from /r/php.
The problem with codility is that they seem to test more math and geometry than they do actual coding. You don't need any actual skills in any of the languages to solve their problems, just a good handle of math. I wouldn't trust this at all.
Are you saying google should or shouldn't be allowed in this kind of test?
You use recursion daily? Seriously? Only three times in my entire 13 year PHP career have I ever had to do something in PHP recursively.
Yes, there are practice exam books available on Amazon.
Ha, no one ever knows that stuff, bro. At a Fortune 500 company in Dallas, I personally interviewed something like 30 short-listed people over the course of a year. No one knew that. No one. My boss was like ::facepalm:: and just told me to "dumb it down" again and again. By the end of it, we hired three guys who all had BS in ComSci but didn't know about XSS, SQL injection, one of the guys we hired couldn't even write a frackin SQL statement OR use an ORM. No knowledge of MVC or any design patterns. These are people who claim to have "5 to 10 years" experience. Then I see these types of people on /r/php acting all big and bad. Then, when you get right down to it, look around at your own coworkers and even people here on /r/php. How many of them (and do you?): 1. Use IDEs (as opposed to nano, vim, gedit, all sorts of editors mentioned on /r/php) 2. Know how and use Breakpoints 3. Know what the Locals window is and use it 4. Know what APC is and use it 5. Know what Adapters, Factories, and Proxies are, and where and how to use them. 6. Know what MVC is. 7. Can build a simplistic MVC from scratch. 8. Can code without a framework. 9. Knows what Views, Triggers, and SPROCS are and where and how to use them. Chances are not even you know all that stuff, but it is what I consider **essential** for any *Senior PHP Engineer* to know. 
Yes, it does.
Tough question. On one hand, checking someone's google-fu can be pretty important, sometimes more important than whether they can remember the code. On the other, it may not be a good use of time. If it were me, I'd give them problems where the solution through logic was more important than the solution through implementation. Then again, I also strongly believe that given a brilliant developer with sub-par team skills/communication is a worthless employee so maybe I'm not the one to ask.
I might not write code that use it, but I use code that uses it - for example, generating page map to/from given page. Yes, I know there are different ways to for eg. generate page map, but it all comes down to how much data you're working with - sometimes ist just faster to use recursion.
I always love finding a if($var = 'something'){ that is supposed to be a if($var == 'something'){
Thanks for this link. I have a lot of reading to do so I can answer all of these!
Try adding a / before the final &gt; in the input tag, i.e.: &lt;input type = "text" name = "whatever" value = "" /&gt;
&gt; there have been studies done at google/facebook and such that show that good project managers don't necessarily need to know the programming languages their subordinates are using. This is news to me. Could I ask for some extra information? I'd like to track those down: that result is counter-intuitive.
I'm glad you said that; you stopped me from going on a long-winded rant about what's wrong with that table.
actually i like zend form, its pretty nice. the decorators are pretty easy once you understand how it works. the learning curve though is pretty high. hockey stick high. best way is to play around with it.
Oh, lots. There are things in there which don't belong; he put things at radically wrong difficulties to get it to stack to the right column count, some stuff is repeated, some of it is silly, et cetera. Still, sometimes just seeing someone else's swing at a thing is enough to get one's mind going so that they can make a better one of their own. I would, actually, be interested to hear about any downsides as you saw them; I didn't make that table, and I'm curious if you've noticed problems that I haven't.
I've used [phpList](http://www.phplist.com/) a few times. The interface is a bit klunky, but overall it hasn't caused me enough pain to spend much time seeking out alternatives. The MySQL backend is pretty straightforward to work with, if you need to write some custom code to integrate it with other projects.
We've used MailChimp a few times at work. I haven't had very much experience with it myself but I haven't heard too many complaints from the other programmers. 
You [should probably](http://www.phpcatalyst.com/php-compare-strings.php) be using if ($var === 'something') { It's if 'something' is in fact a string. :) 
An Open Source mailing list that works like MailChimp would be a dream, but at the moment phplist is *the best* there is. phplist needs to be thrown away and rewritten from scratch - it just carries too much legacy baggage to move forward IMO, but the core of it does do some things very right. [poMMo](http://www.pommo.org/Main_Page) was a good start at a replacement, but the developer seems to have given up soon after the first release.
It was just a simple quick example
I thought that might be the case, but you never know. I certainly wish someone had told me that sooner.
i wouldn't and would cough up a few dollars for mailchimp
GSto &gt; without paying for it? hopeseekr &gt; books available on Amazon. Me &gt; &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
NO EXCUSE.
MailMan -&gt; http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html 
Do you always check if a function already exists? That seems like it could add up to a lot of overhead as your library grows. Wouldn't it be more efficient to fix namespace collisions as they occur?
Fair comment, but in my experience most developers are pretty multi skilled and know a few languages.
Netbeans is free too
I don't use functions (by themselves) very much, just in a few rare classes. I use classes or namespaces. 
nope, this: https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/
Newsletter manager indeed, not a classic mailing list manager.
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. Honestly, managing your own mailing software is way more headache than it's worth. Something like Mailchimp or CampaignMonitor are well worth the nominal cost to not have to worry about your opt-in messages going to spam because your outgoing server isn't configured correctly, or isn't recording bounces right, or the any other dozens of unforseen pains that come with trying to mass email.
Not to mention if anyone flags it in say Gmail that you could always go to spam. I too recommend MailChimp for any new startup, too many headaches when you need people to get your message.
Well as I explained in a post earlier it's unethical to be getting candidates to do free work for your business. Heck you could get a new candidate in each day to build some portion of a system. By the end of a few weeks you'd have a full code base. Old problems are fine though or some old code samples. I said a take home -small- assignment so the person can use their own development environment, IDE, tools, browsers etc rather than trying to get accustomed to their ones as well as do the test in a short time frame. Some places I've been to haven't even provided an internet connection. If they were wanting something done with a MySQL database I'd hope they had SQLyog so I could create a visual view of the schema, relationships etc. Wouldn't want to be wasting time doing it all on the command line.
oh man, those were painful days when i had to configure and maintain those lists, sure it's better today
The last bit I was joking - it was a Dilbert comic. I would never do that, I'm not a massive dick.
http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/2011/03/28/google-cracks-the-code-on-good-managers/
Yup I know, you put a :P face in. Just saying it so the OP doesn't get any bright ideas.
Oh ok. That wouldn't probably matter then if it was a small part of generic code.
Thank you kindly.
rough day? You sound angry.
Well I wish you the best of luck. I'm not much for Zend, only worked with it back at IBM, however if you have questions about base PHP I'm sure I'll be around to help.
I'm about to run this script: forfiles /P "C:\Windows\Temp" /S /M *.* /D -2 /C "cmd /c del @path" EDIT: I'm impatient; I ran it. EDIT2: [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51054/batch-file-to-delete-files-older-than-n-days)
Deleting those files just means that people's sessions will be messed up. Your code should be agile enough to handle this, and just log them out. They'll have to log back in. I think sessions are supposed to have a TTL... might want to look int0 that, because it sounds like it turned off for you.
OH DEAR GOD, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
I NOT GOOD WITH PUTER!
TTL?
Time-to-live. A set amount of seconds until the session expires and deletes itself.
Time To Live, though he really just means expiration time.
The session expires but what about the file in the 'temp' directory? Isn't the Garbage Collector responsible for deleting the actual files?
Usually when the session expires, PHP will delete the file. At least that's been my experience.
I thought you meant without having to take the test for $150 and possibly fail. Stop being a cheapskate.
Yeah, it is, but it runs at a random interval. If someone messed with the settings... it might not clean up. I always used to set up a cronjob to run every day to clear every 33 days (our sessions expired after 32). I'm kinda tired but this thread talks about it a little more: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/654310/cleanup-php-session-files
I think I'm going to end up setting a *Scheduled Task* &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; using my forfiles script. Thanks for the link, though; this helps. :) 
sendgrid... edit: isnt that a perfectly simple solution without you having to deal with crap for a week?
Yea, usually Apache takes care of this
Sometimes, I seriously question Windows and IIS. 
agreed. Mailchimp is a fantastic service.
LOL . you should
mongodb, regex or keyword tree. db.items.insert({name:"Sony", items:["item1","item2"]}); db.items.find({items:"item2",$where:{items.lenght:1}});
If you have a specific section you want to talk about then let me know. But without having to get too lengthy or type out the items I'll just point out some general problems I have with it. And some of this is just reiterating what you already said. Some of the level 0 stuff is just complete rubbish and seems to exist just for the hell of it or maybe to condescend to non-programmers. Thinks Excel is a database? Come on. The other levels don't really have any meaning. You'd expect some sort of consistency but there is none. Some of these items just look like words he threw together without any thought or are just in complete disarray. Systems programming, database, for starters. Others are confusing or just downright incomplete thoughts like he typed them in a hurry. Some are conflicts in specificity. Others look like filler to stretch the category out to four columns. See code organization and IDE sections. Some of the weirder specifics in there I feel don't really belong. Apparently I have to know all of the VCS on his list to be highly competent but my knowledge of TFS is useless I guess. And apparently writing my own defensive coding library makes me an expert in defensive coding. Some are just laughable like the blog section or years of professional/platform experience sections. As if numbers really mean anything. 
What you want is to store the search terms in their own table and then maintain a join table to map search terms to the products table. For example: products ----------- prod_id name search_terms ----------------- term_id term product_search_terms ----------------------------- prod_id term_id Then you build your query using various joins. It's much faster that way. The one gotcha is you'll often have to use nested SELECTS, which take some getting used to, but your database will thank you. 
&gt; I'm about to run this script: &gt; &gt; forfiles /P "C:\Windows\Temp" /S /M *.* /D -2 /D "cmd /c del @path" &gt; &gt; EDIT: I'm impatient; I ran it. &gt; &gt; Everything looks go... Connection lost.
What? That's PHP job, not Apache. Did you (OP) change the default session directory? If so, the session GC wont touch it - you need to delete if manualy as the manual explains.
This is exactly why I don't use PHP sessions.
Sending bulk mail is easy. Making sure that email reaches its' destination, without your server getting blacklisted, is hard.
Make sure the IIS/PHP user (usually IUSR_something_or_another) actually has permissions to clean up it's own mess first, and save the duct tape for when the memory issues start.
linux would know what to do.
It is basically inexcusable to not normalize this data into the schema LaughingFridge has provided you. You will almost certainly be able to make a script to do this. There is a really good chance that at least SOMETHING mildly consistent separates each (or at least most) of the items. When you say "correctly spaced" it makes me think you are doing something weird. You should almost certainly be using the PHP function explode(). Let's assume you have the list of items stored in a string called $items. First, let's get rid of any multiple spaces. //Before: $items = "Scissors, Screws, Hammers"; $items = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $items); //After: $items = "Scissors, Screws, Hammers"; OR //Before: $items = "Scissors Screws Hammers"; $items = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $items); //After: $items = "Scissors Screws Hammers"; Now, let's explode the string based on "," or " " $itemsArray = explode(",", $items); OR $itemsArray = explode(" ", $items); //$itemsArray = array('Scissors', 'Screws', 'Hammers'); You might have to trim() each item, I can't recall. Post the some of your data (including the worst examples) and I'm sure someone can help you out if this doesn't do it straight away. Edit: I just read another of your comments that said the delimiter could be - or / as well. Same thing applies. Just replace all the - and / and | with a comma before you do anything. You might find a couple of oddball mistakes like hyphenated words, but just fix those by hand.
I will create my own in time, but I'm too busy with a current project to work on the test. Otherwise it is a good solution, we already do this for a couple of other positions. 
zend... the zend_auth module is super simple to use...
Permissions are fine. I'd like to know how the PHP Garbage Collector knows which files to clean up. Is there a code/command needed for when a session is begun that registers it with the GC? 
I'm pretty sure it just sweeps the directory for timestamps. Whenever a session is called on, it'll touch the session file to keep it fresh, and just delete whatever is past expiration. Another thing worth a look: grep through the code and look for anything that might be `ini_set`-ting the session lifetime to something thoughtless (overriding php.ini's default). If that's not the case, I'm not too sure what else to check.
Sometimes you'll only make a site that **won't** be hosted on a cheap shared hosting environment and you'll have full control over the server to enable short tags because you'll be on a VPS or dedicated server. Even on a shared host that won't matter anyway because you can enable them with **ini_set('short_open_tag', '1');** in your front controller. Sometimes you'll also have no need to use XML in your PHP site or you're using HTML5 not outdated XHTML. But if you do need to use XML, then for that specific file that needs XML you can use the full PHP tags. Got any more cases of why it can't be used?
What do you use instead?
You could take a look at a framework (codeigniter would suit you well) and refactor your code to work in the frameworks MVC layout. Doing this would be a good way of figuring out how MVC works.
Yeah I've looked at the CodeIgnitor videos and documentation. Still hasn't clicked for me yet. Still have no idea where my existing code (linked above) could fit in terms of the MVC or how to structure it properly. I can see what would go into the View part, that would be the HTML code there. But where do I put all the other code and the form processing code in the controller or the model? Should it be made into functions?
You're right the view should just be dispalying content to the use. The controller should handle the business logic of the application. So in there you'll have a method for each route and make the calls to the relevant models and methods. The models are just PHP classes and contain the application logic. So form validation, database methods, user classes etc.
He probably means he uses his own session handler
I know exactly what you mean, I've always said there are 3 different types of PHP developer: Self-taught/college **Junior PHP Developer** who can knock up a website if they have to, but doesn't really know about the ins and outs of PHP, probably has very old code libraries and no conventions to adhere too. Knows basic front-end stuff like JS/HTML/CSS, but probably copying + pasting examples from other places a lot of the time. Then there's the **Senior Developer** as you mentioned above, has a computer science/programming degree/advanced education and could probably work well with *any* programming language and understands advanced terminologies and knows when they apply. Security practices and conventions are al hard-coded in this person mindset. Can tick all boxes on that list but may not have a great deal of experience in front-end development, as they are sitting behind 4 screens coding an API. Then there's that bleak area in between I'd call it *Enthusiast Developer*, it's the self-taught developer whose been developing for a few years now and likes to keep up to date with coding conventions, frameworks and security practices et al. More than likely worked in a commercial environment at somepoint, maybe with Senior Devs who have taught them a thing or two, and thus can be 'trusted' as much as a senior developer to make a site 'properly'. Probably has a lot of Frontend experience with jQuery/CSS/Frameworks. I'm by no means a senior dev, at 23 people would probably still think I am a junior but fuck that, the area between junior and senior is large and under appreciated.
Hmmm.. what version of PHP? From [TFM](http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime) &gt;Note: If you are using the default file-based session handler, your filesystem must keep track of access times (atime). Windows FAT does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a FAT filesystem or any other filesystem where atime tracking is not available. Since PHP 4.2.3 it has used mtime (modified date) instead of atime. So, you won't have problems with filesystems where atime tracking is not available. 
Ah yes of course. I do as well to store the session data in the database, but that was as a security precaution in case the site was going to be hosted on a shared platform.
If you want a better NetBeans, post your remarks in the netbeans-php list (or the forum, if you really don't like mailing lists). Ranting on reddit is mostly useless. The main NB developers probably don't wander here much. If you post something there, please be clear and constructive. Give code examples with what you expected and what happened. Give the tickets numbers of the bugs you thought were related.
Also XML is a pretty strict format and it starts with the text: &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; Surely they should fix the PHP parser to not get confused between &lt;? &lt;?= and &lt;?xml because how hard is it really to see they're different? If it sees just a &lt;? and &lt;?= it should immediately assume PHP code in the next section. If it sees a &lt;?xml then it's XML.
That's a strange list. I do know everything in it, but I feel some of them are not that important. &gt; *2.* Know how and use Breakpoints Aren't unit tests more useful than this? And continuous integration? I almost never use breakpoints. &gt; *3.* Know what the Locals window is and use it You mean the "Local variables window of the IDE while debugging"? So points 2 and 3 are just "Using a debugger". Once again, I don't value step-by-step debugging that much. XDebug is useful, but not much for stepping through code. I prefer its profiling features. &gt; *4.* Know what APC is and use it APC has 2 uses. As an opcode cache, that's not something a developer has to worry about, and even if it knows it, there isn't anything to do. As an in-memory keystore (a kind of light memcache), it's useful, but not a mandatory knowledge. And any developer can master it within minutes. &gt; *9.* Knows what Views, Triggers, and SPROCS are and where and how to use them. I don't think you have to master this to be a *senior PHP Engineer*. These SQL tools can be useful to some projects, but most of the time they are unsuited. I won't enter into details, just mention some of the problems: versioning, unit testing, debugging, portability.
You notify next-of-kin, I'll rifle through his wallet for Hot Pockets coupons.
IIS 7 is actually pretty good. Not a lot of gotchas. The only problem I've had is Wordpress and Joomla aren't set up to handle a site served up off a SAN. A quick modification to each of them and they work fine.
I recently started getting used to PHP OO after years of procedural! It's great! Perhaps check out [Nettut's PHP OO Beginner](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/object-oriented-php-for-beginners/) article where they give a few good examples. As for your code, remember, the controller tells your app what to do. It should really only be creating objects, and using functions. Classes (models) are essentially the group of functions for that object. Perhaps you have class "User", and a function inside called "function changePassword()". The view should then be just a php/html template really. With my current setup, I actually have a class for my template... that will generate the different items of the page, and then the controller includes the template file which just has the variables in it - nicely organized to where they need to be. Hope this help!
Hi, thanks for your reply, before posting i was triying to normalize data with a script, usign regexp, explode, preg_match and almost everything i thought of. As i told, i failed. The data is in spanish, but it contains numbers (wich i removed easily with a regexp), might contain adverbs and other things: mantequilla una cucharadita de **harina** 2 cucharadas soperas de **coñac** 2 cucharadas soperas de **pimienta verde** un vaso de **leche** \*\* what i need **** - 30 cangrejosde rio - 2 zanahorias medianas - 50 gr de cebolla y una chalota - 150 gr detomate - Un vaso de vino blanco - 3 cucharadas de buen cognac - hierbasaromáticas - 3 cucharadas de aceite - 30 gr de mantequilla - perejil - sal,pimienta y cayena **** Every item is a world on it's own, yesterday i started to manually parse them.
&gt; Thinks Excel is a database? Come on. Excel is more of a database than Paradox or FoxPro were. Whereas that isn't its primary purpose, I don't think anyone would argue that Firefox, which can interpret SQL queries and keeps local storage, at this point isn't a database too. (Two points if you see why that sentence structure is legit.) Otherwise I entirely agree with you on every other comment.
thanks, that's nice to know
It's an interesting topic and there is several useful comments on how e.g I would proceed. I've been coding in PHP the last 4? years, got a decent knowledge of MVCs and can use CodeIgniter fairly good. I hate doing web designs but I feel it just helps me when it comes to putting the whole project together. What I need to learn is a SCM. My favourite thing to do is small scripts that mainly involves contacting an external source to retrieve/set data from. My last "work" was a script that queries an appartment dealer and automatically adds interest if the appartment size/rent/location are accepted by my filters. Honestly I'm just babbling right now but I think this post is well-needed and I'm greatful for every answer so far!
I've had this happen in linux too
I've had this happen several times, just deleted the session files in /var/lib/php5 and I'm good to go until next time.
In addition, I like to think of MVC as if I'm two different programmers: one who writes the models and database schemas, and another who interfaces with the model API (controllers, views, configurations). Models should be generally ignorant of whatever interfaces with it (controllers). I had a problem with "getting" MVC, so I feel your pain. Here's a quick example, which fetches monster information (maybe from a video game?) from a database. class BaseController { /** This method might do other stuff related to View, like error messages or updating a navigation array **/ public function render($file) { include $file; } } class MonsterController extends BaseController { public $monsterinfo; public function get() { $identifier = $_GET['monster']; $monster = new MonsterModel; $this-&gt;monsterinfo = $monster-&gt;getMonsterInfo($identifier); // Calls on the BaseController render() method $this-&gt;render('monstertemplate.php'); } } /** Anything functions that can be shared across all model classes should go here. Maybe a universal hashing method, or session management? **/ class BaseModel { // ... } class MonsterModel extends BaseModel { public function getMonsterInfo($identifier) { $sql = new SqlClass; return $sql-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM monsters WHERE name = '$monster'"); } } From "monstertemplate.php" you can simply do something like foreach($this-&gt;monsterinfo as $monster) { var_dump($monster); } ...because technically you're still working in MonsterController, and its properties (variables) are still accessible even from the template. You'll need to use a router controller to route http requests to appropriate controllers. [F3 Fat Free](http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/) has a dead-simple router and good documentation. You can build your own router, but it's not a trivial task. Let me know if you have any other questions.
Aside from getting to a framework, here's a few tips: 1. Keep PHP logic and HTML as separate as possible. The way I do it is get your data first! Depending on what happens during data retrieval, you can appropriately get the right template, depending on a response. Say your database is down: if you are getting your data first, you can catch the error, and display a 403/404/etc. template. If you're doing it in line, your page might stop loading/not display the appropriate templates. 2. Try to make your code more Object Oriented. Making your code OO'ed makes it easier to read and maintain. Take your SQL calls. 3. Try using a templating engine. I use Smarty, and I've never had issues with it. Of course, you could just use php files that only echo out values. Aside from that, it's just practice. No body becomes good over night. I've been programming MVC/OOP'ed web applications for a few years now, and I still have a lot to learn. I'm going to keep hammering at it, making sure I'm using the best possible practices, keeping up with new technologies, etc. You'll get there. Keep at it, and good luck!
Hmm good to know, never knew that. Has it always been this way, or what version of PHP did this start?
I thought that is how it was but thanks for verifying.
a good rule of thumb is 'fat model, skinny controller'. If your in doubt, then it probably goes in the model. remember that the controller's only job is to get a request (usually in the form of the url &amp; get/post variables) and decide what to do with it. The model is there to handle data, and everything that goes along with it, which includes things like validation, authentication, etc. So all of the code that makes queries, writes/reads session, etc. would go in the model, whereas the controller would be where you may want to check if a user is logged in or not, and send them to the appropriate page.
I'm pretty new to PHP, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm not certain how you have the user verification set up, but I imagine that it's something along the lines of if login is successful, set a session variable that identifies the user as having been authenticated to true when posted to another page. From there you can use an if else statement. if (!isset($_SESSION['user_authenticated']) || $_SESSION['user_authenticated'] != "true") { // if session variable user_authenticated doesn't exist or is // anything else(does not equal), redirect to login page session_destroy(); header('Location: login.php'); } That basically checks if they're logged in. If the user is not logged in, the parser/interpreter won't bother with the code after that. Otherwise, if they are authenticated, it will handle the rest and display the 'secured' information. **Edit:** Keep in mind that I haven't tested that code yet. I'm at work so I cant test to see if it is error free or not. The concept is there, though. And to clarify, the login form would set the session variable user_authenticated to true if successful, otherwise it would have them login again. That if statement would go on the top of the 'secured' pages to check if the user is logged in. However, what the others are saying is very true. You want to have a solid understanding of how that information is passed to the next page. How it is verified, and how the user enters the information. For instance, if you use javascript to verify or 'determine' the time the employee clocks in, that data is rather easily manipulated resulting in tainted input. There exists the potential for many vulnerabilities from not having a complete plan of attack. 
There is interesting discussion on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2591845).
5.2.11
What's the default session directory?
 ini_set Thanks, I will look for this.
Not sure about Windows / IIS but for *nix it's /tmp. According to PHP docs: &gt; Note: Prior to PHP 4.3.6, Windows users had to change this variable in order to use PHP's session functions. A valid path must be specified, e.g.: c:/temp. I'm guessing that by default it would be c:\Windows\Temp or the IIS user's temp directory. Sorry I can't be much of help.
c:\windows\temp is what I'm currently using. Thanks, though.
I never found much difference (if any) from the simple change of interpreted to compiled. It simply makes for more or less of [this](http://xkcd.com/303/), respectively.
Might as well schedule a daily delete if you're going to do that :/
Holy crap that is one big pile of a mess. First off, you have a a LOT of objects with functions that are called to perform a task that should be handled elsewhere. Secondly, why are you using a templating system (crude or basic?) with multiple instantiations along with raw html? I see $rtr, $stat, and raw html output. I guess that's why you see a need to clean up the code. In MVC structure, you would have an Account controller alongside with others: Controller Account function index() // defaults to this if url contains just account function reset() // url request contains account/reset function ... //rest of actions that belong to account function reset() { switch($_GET['stage']) { case 1: //do something break; case N: //do more stuff break; default: //depending on framework, you might be able to redirect //or just default to case 1 and execute same code break; } $view = view_instance-&gt;get('your_view_to_account_reset'); $template-&gt;set($view); }
I forgot to add that I am modifying [this code](http://www.ic.sunysb.edu/Stu/jseyster/plasma/source.html) for my algorithm. Unfortunately, it is not returning any values. Just rendering an image.
I pretty much have to since the GC isn't doing its job. I wish I could figure out *why* the GC isn't doing its job but this is outside of my scope of knowledge. I'm a sysadmin, not a PHP expert. 
I think based on the gleaned context of that particular section of the table, that the author is referring to services where data management is the primary function. And I tend to assume that's really what people commonly refer to when they talk about databases. I consider Excel more of a data formatter. You can make some pretty-looking pivot tables and charts but it lacks some basic database traits like explicit indexing and type constraints and so forth. And forget trying to manage large amounts of data. In all my years I've never heard even a layman refer to Excel or an Excel document as a database; always a spreadsheet. That's purely anecdotal but it would at least explain why I scoffed at that part of the competency table. I would think that even a "level 0" programmer knows the difference.
 foreach (explode(' ', str_replace('\n', ' ', str_replace('\r', ' ', original))) as $uword) { $word = trim($uword); if ($word != '') { ...
I guess the more accurate association would be going from loose typing to strict typing. I commonly associate these with interpreted vs. compiled, which I know isn't a pure relationship, but it's just kind of organized that way in my head. But yeah, the compilation isn't what causes the shift in thinking, it's the switchover from the _having your way with a variable_ to _you must tell me right now what this variable does and that must never change_.
&gt; but it lacks some basic database traits like explicit indexing and type constraints and so forth So do Paradox and Foxpro (and, for that matter, SQLlite.)
It's because you aren't passing in $arr by reference. Change that to &amp;$arr. You're assigning your data to a copy.
You sir, are a scholar and a gentleman. Thank you very much!
To disable, go to your php.ini and set: _expose\_php = Off_
Sho 'nuff.
I... I suddenly feel better about my programming skills. I can't even think of myself as a programmer, but there are compsci graduates who can't even solve those?
Anyone else think this is kind of a waste of code and space? The article mentioned it uses 21kb of memory every time a PHP process is called :/
I'm glad this exists.
lol php sadness
**Additional Info:** Using MYSQLi obectively. I connect to the database with: &lt;?php $mysqli= new mysqli( 'xxxxx', #host 'xxxxx', #username 'xxxxx', #password 'xxxxx'); #database name if ($mysqli-&gt;connect_error) { die("Connect Error: $mysqli-&gt;connect_error"); } ?&gt; I have an auto incrementing ID field, a 'Title' Field, 'Description' Field and a field which contains the URL to an image so I can use &lt;img src="&lt;url from database&gt;" alt="&lt;title from database&gt;" /&gt; I need to have it formatted the same way as the picture and I'm stuck on how to separate the data so each row is formatted this way to form what will be a portfolio of artwork. Doing this for a school project so any help is greatly appreciated.
Came here to say this.
This should be the default. WTF.
i am in love with this php sadness guy
Not sure about Paradox but the other two do indeed have explicit indexing and type constraints unless perhaps you're talking about older versions.
The image itself is only 2.5kb. It's used when you called phpinfo() to display the logo on the resulting page. In the grand scheme of things, this is very insignificant. I wonder where the author gets the 21kb number from. 
There is no default settings in PHP. Download from PHP.net and you get 2 ini files with **suggested configurations**. As far as I can remember, starting in PHP 5.3, `expose_php` is OFF in `php.ini-production`.
Most of his stuff are completely out of bounds. Take for example [#16](http://www.phpsadness.com/?page=sad/16). This is only possible if you overwrite the default error handler and your custom one crashes. It's your own damn fault for not handling errors properly. Same can be said with C# if you overwrite `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` and you are stupid enough to ignore another exception.
It's 21kb... If you are running such an enormous site or so many sites that 21kb * p = a large number you can afford an extra stick of RAM. While I understand why you optimizing code as much as reasonably possible, we need to keep perspective. After all, almost every program in existence has a credit section...
how come?
Not the only way; you can also provoke this error by throwing an exception in the session save handler (which will happen if you assign an unserializable object (such as a PDO instance) to a session variable or something that references such an object) .. and possibly also if you throw an exception within register_shutdown_function handling (not tested it, just guessing).
So the Ubuntu package maintainers are to blame? I see that it's On with the default php5/apache2 install on Ubuntu 10.04.
For the most part, I'm with you. 99 percent of sites really shouldn't care. You lost me at &gt; After all, almost every program in existence has a credit section... The credit section of any program isn't loaded into memory until requested. This is loaded every time a page is requested.
A little off topic, but how does one enable nice error reporting in the browser like [this](http://www.phpsadness.com/?page=sad/1)? I noticed it was on in a new version of wamp, but not on our cpanel server at work.
BINGO. Download the distribution from PHP directly. You'll notice there isn't a php.ini included. Only two INIs... You HAVE to rename one and configure it to use.
Most programs don't load their credit into memory. A fair upvotable point. But, a lot of programs come with a splash screen and a huge logo, or worse yet multiple animated videos. Relatively speaking I'd still rate this as average, not as bad as some, not as good as others.
 #1 is the pettiest thing i've ever seen. Surely you open with a shocker, but that's just sad.

Umm.. yeah I know. My point is that the criticism is stupid, not the design choice :)
Decent resource leveling in some easy web-based (PHP) project manager. I think everyone suffers big-time from time allocation from their masters at one time at least.
However, if you are changing a very large array you may want to use pass by reference.
with XDebug
How about [#18](http://www.phpsadness.com/?page=sad/18), where he points out that a static variable acts like a static variable.

Graphical form filler ie: scan a doc, or upload a pdf, and define fields - then allow to be filled out repeatedly. Acrobat comes close - but isn't really php/web friendly. 
btw, I recommend trying an ORM if you haven't before. The zend_db syntax is rather ugly. Both Propel and Doctrine provide an api for doing things like this with a standard syntax. I'd recommend Propel for starters. Also, I'm a fan of magic finders eg $user = $userModel-&gt;findOneByFnameAndLname('john', 'doe');
The $rtr object is a Router class to do the page routing from relative paths in the URL to actual files to load. The $stat object is for a Status class that displays messages on the page for the user. e.g. header('location:' .USER_DIR. 'reset.php?status=requiredFieldsEmpty'); The Status class would pick up the status codes like that and translate them to an english error or warning message for displaying to the user. I guess some of the code I had tacked on to the Router class, it should all be in a Template class if it's to do with displaying to the page and leave the URL routing to just the Router class. What does $template-&gt;set($view); do? Just do an include of the html view php file?
There's this thing called spell-check. It usually helps, but sometimes I spell piece when I really mean peace.
Ok that example is very good thanks, I can see what's going on there. Can you tell me about the file system structure you use? Like where are you putting the BaseController and BaseModel classes in relation to your general controller and model ones for each page? One problem I might have is I have 11 sub-directories for all my different sets of pages to logically group the files e.g. admin, user, licences etc. There might be around 5 pages in each directory doing various things on the site. So if I had to split my existing page into 3 files for controllers, models and views I might end up with: - controllers - admin - user - licences - etc - models - admin - user - licences - etc - views - admin - user - licences - etc Or I guess you could do it: - admin - controllers - models - views - user - controllers - models - views - licences - controllers - models - views Still going to end up with like 33 sub directories (3 x 11 subdirectories). Also each existing file I have would be multiplied by 3 as well so I might end up with (3 x 5 files x 11 subdirectories = 165 files). Is this excessive, or just one of the things with a big site?
Great, thank-you I will keep this in mind as I refactor it.
Great, quite helpful thank-you.
The way I'd differentiate is that most programs aren't scripting languages that are being (potentially) started hundreds of times per second. Again, I agree with you. I'm just pointing out, perhaps with futility, the incongruity. **edit**: I read up and Wikipedia, the example in the article, gets 25,000 to 60,000 page views per second! That's 1,260,000 kb _every second_ in overhead. That's fairly substantial! Again, most sites are not of this size, but PHP devs should really be aware of it if traffic starts to get big. Waste not, want not.
Yeah only a spell checker wouldn't have picked that up though.
Try to avoid using exit(), it's bad practice and will cause you grief in the future when you have thousands of lines of code to maintain.
Sometimes I feel guilty when I don't notice a bug in my code before running it for the first time... I mean, what if the code had thought it was going to succeed on its' first time, but then ended up in Fatal Error alley? Makes me feel awful!
Why is it bad practice? I'm only using it after a redirect which is what you're supposed to do [to stop the remaining code from executing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2747791/why-i-have-to-call-exit-after-redirection-through-headerlocation-in-php). As for exit; vs exit(); it's a function call so should have the parenthesis even if you don't have to put a status code inside it. As for die() vs exit() they both do the same thing, but I prefer the exit() syntax. What's the reasoning behind not using it?
It's actually not a function call, but rather a construct. As for the reasoning, many applications might have processing that runs at the end (cleaning up, benchmarks, logging, etc..). By doing exit() or die(), you might be ending the script prematurely. It's no so much of a problem in your case right now, but its very important to think about when doing applications.
It's also great if you have your file extension set to something else and people want to know what language the server they're attacking is running.
File structure is really up to you, but *personally* I like to do it like this: - application - models BaseModel.php MonsterModel.php ... - controllers BaseController.php MonsterController.php MonsterDirectoryController.php MonsterEditController.php MonsterFeatured.php - views monstertemplate.php - library - public_html - css - jscript - img - docs index.php index.php is responsible for routing the user to the appropriate controller depending on the request uri. I have a single controller for every different "path" (ex: one for /users/, another for /users/edit/, etc). Model files don't have to mimic controllers (infact you should have far fewer models than controllers). Just think of models as library code - you should expect a hundred other programmers to interface with your model library, who write their own routing, controllers, and template files. Your models just provide a general-purpose library of reusable functions and properties. I once read an analogy of MVC that relates to light switches. The model was the national electric service (dam turbines, nuclear power plants, power lines, etc), controllers are light switches (simply an interface to the power grid), and the view is the lightbulb. This is a decent way to think about MVC. Let's add a little more functionality to our Monster model class. class MonsterModel extends BaseModel { public $types = array("demon", "undead", "dwarf"); public function getMonsterInfo($identifier) { $sql = new SqlClass; return $sql-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM monsters WHERE name = '$monster'"); } public function editMonsterInfo($monsterName, $monsterHealth, $monsterLevel) { $sql = new SqlClass; $monsterName = validateMonsterInfo($monsterName); $monsterHealth = validateMonsterInfo($monsterHealth); $monsterLevel = validateMonsterInfo($monsterLevel); $sql-&gt;query("INSERT INTO monsters VALUES ($monsterName, $monsterHealth, $monsterLevel)"); } // Scrubs html characters from user input and makes it pretty public function validateMonsterInfo($string) { $string = ucwords(strtolower($string)); $string = htmlspecialchars($string); return $string; } } Without paying attention to our controllers or views, we've added some functionality to our monster model class. Now any controller, and other models, can use these methods and properties. The point being, models and controllers are [loosely coupled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_\(computer_programming\)). If you were to suddenly decide to delete your controllers and views and rewrite them from scratch in a completely different way, you shouldn't have to touch your models to get the same functionality as you had before your started over. As far as refactoring goes, it's just a matter of finding parts of your code that could be more elegant, or putting inside a function pieces of programming that you reuse often. Functions should be as *relatively* general-purpose, as in, you shouldn't have to write two functions that do mostly the same thing but with one or a few minor differences. I hope this helps, let me know if you're still having trouble. 
&gt; The way I'd differentiate is that most programs aren't scripting languages that are being (potentially) started hundreds of times per second. Good point. &gt; I read up and Wikipedia, the example in the article, gets 25,000 to 60,000 page views per second! That's 1,260,000 kb every second in overhead. That's fairly substantial! Again, most sites are not of this size, but PHP devs should really be aware of it if traffic starts to get big. Waste not, want not. This just furthers my argument. In order to accommodate the entire performance penalty this credit incurs, Wikipedia only needs to purchase one gigabyte extra of RAM split up between everyone one of their servers. That's an insanely miniscule payment when stacked up against giving the authors attribution for the thousands of hours of free work from them... *especially* when it's completely optional that you enable it.
I've done this multiple times with php and ruby apps. It's fairly trivial to do actually, but the defining fields part is really really time consuming (the last one I did we had around 150 forms with 2-15 pages each, we farmed out the fields part to India and got back crap and had to redo it all).
I think I like you.
Well I do need a new friend. But, I get the feeling you'd be a terrible wingman.
How do you propose exiting properly after a redirect then? I get your point about immediately cutting off execution. Do the destructors for objects have time to get called after the exit() statement? For example, I could see how this would be a problem if you were using your own session handler to save to a database instead of files and in the destructor method it does the final save of the session data to the database. If it exited out before the final save could occur then the session data wouldn't be written. Maybe you could wrap it in a function? But not sure how to clean up the remaining objects etc. The PHP garbage collector probably cleans it up when the script finishes? public function redirect($url) { // Writes session data to database session_write_close(); header('Location: ' . $url); exit(); }
but... why come?
You can remove the end ?&gt; in your PHP and it shouldn't output any whitespace/content after it finishes executing. In fact, some frameworks like Zend framework specify that you must omit the ending PHP tag if the file is only PHP. Destructors do get called if you use exit ("object destructors will always be executed even if exit() is called" see http://php.net/manual/en/function.exit.php). If you're doing something like benchmarks/logging/etc.. in destructors, you will have problems because the order of destructor execution is very unpredictable.
Ok. I think it's still handy to do a redirect &amp; exit as if they enter something incorrect on the form you can immediately redirect them back to fix it, rather than having massive list of *else if* statements so the code doesn't accidentally execute anything else after the redirect.
Well, redirecting for form errors is actually pretty bad too. You're basically letting the user dictate the application state via a URL parameter. For example, I could do ?state=resetCodeProcessing in the URL, and it would send the form without doing a check. But then again, you are using javascript to send the email... So I could just type in whateverajaxdirectoryis/ajax-send-email.php in my address bar and exploit the shit out of your mail server.
..isn't php open source? couldn't he work on fixing the bugs?
it's open source, but not just anybody can work on the project. You have to actually be apart of the development team to add new code to the project.
since Zend afaik
The URL parameters just reference a display message. They don't actually execute any code. A user could enter any of the message codes in the URL and if it it matches the approved list, it will just display a specific error/success message for that code that's it. The application doesn't go off and do something based on that status code. Also it doesn't POST the form until you click the submit button. Also you can't exploit the ajax email as it stores the email data in the session. If it's not there, no email is sent. To get data into the session variables you have to submit the form properly and the account name/email has to be correct. Putting ?state=resetCodeProcessing in the URL doesn't do anything except call the page by ajax which the ajax page then looks at the session variables, but if there's no session data stored then it doesn't send any email and returns an error. You could call the whateverajaxdirectoryis/ajax-send-email.php mail page directly if you want, but it still won't do anything.
Yeah, another black mark against PHP. So many black marks... Why is this even there? For fuck's sake PHP, you make it so hard to love you.
I think github is a much better solution than google code and sourceforge.
The development team wasn't born on the development team. People join such teams by first sharing work, then commit rights are gained over time. It's a meritocracy.
Good question. I'm not going to accept the number without decent evidence, but assume the number refers to all logo data combined. And for good measure, the logo data is stored [here](http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/main/logos.h).
And yet you totally failed to.
Yep, that was my first concern. You carefully hide the PHP version number, and then the list of credits pops up that [I would expect] can be used to determine the exact version in use. The credits do change according to the release, don't they?
Hmm, got this set on all my servers, all running PHP5.3, and still I can see the credits and logo on some servers. I guess I have some investigations to do today... Edit: aha, the php.ini files came with the option turned on further down. I missed those.
I would require the users billing address. Then, have a table in the database that connects zip codes to tax rates.
Why?
I use this geoip library to detect the country, given the IP: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry If you're on linux, it's most likely on your distro's repository. 
You know.... that's a pretty good advice. I've been actually thinking about doing something like that for a while nnow, though I'm not sure how easy could it be to integrate propel or Doctrine at this stage of development. I might check it though, thanks for the advice
10.04 ships PHP5.3? I thought it was 5.2.
The best way would be to limit user input to only valid input selections via drop down. Each state/province record should have a CountryID field that can be checked against the selected country. 
They use this image for things like the PHP info html page. They should instead embed the image base64 encoded. &lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlheABDAOZqAH+CuDk3RyglKszN4qGky9PV57K01ENCWIOGuYKDs1JScpCSwsLE3qqs0ExLY1tcg93e7Ds4PG5xpWptnWFjjXV5sXt+teXm8JmcxoyNwbm62Wtrkk5Oa3F0qXp6o4iLvXJ0o3RzmI6QwVpbfuLj73t9raSl0G1wonJ2rJWWyLu92XR4roWIu5KVw9jZ6pKSxGRmkmtun6WozpSWxS4rL1NRaLO012xqjFxbdoqNv2ZolmhqmpyfyDEuOa6w05yczVVWeJ6hypaZxYGCr2dplz89ULy+2l5giZiZyIyOv4mKuldYfLa319XX6CIeIGxvns7Q5L/A3Hd7tHZ4p19efZmZzG5vmHN3riIeH////5COj1lWV8fGx+7u9dXU1fb2+oKAgayqq3Ryc/Hw8Z6cnePi40tISbm4uWdkZYmJtgD/AEdGX9/g7ZuczGlrnG9zp4yMuri52bi615qbzKeqz9vc65qcyWZkhGhniaeo0m5woIuLucbH4MfJ4WlsnJeYyyH5BAEAAGoALAAAAAB4AEMAAAf/gGqCg4SFhoeIiYqLjI2Oj5CRkpOUlZaXlm0/bXOYnp+gP3l5Nj4acUwaGkwGPj4NMgRBPBhCLQtJIjkfGTkiLymgwqENGgx9TQVQUAN9fAxRUSpyrK90sbNCMy26HwgAFhYVVyglFgkZwcPrjCZxfC5sbBAQdS7JA9QysyIf/iwAEQgEQLDgN4LhpKxA8UbCCT87nkwZkoSdRTVBbAxgQ+KCRxIk8jUQskCKyZMoU6pceXJcBwkTduiAQeEIBStDRFzEFIQJFI4eL7gwQqcFy6NIk6K88iYGjCNHHoxYcsSDzp2Qfmh0AYEjBCMEWCgdSzbplRM6HiwBokDBiCkz/7AuMqGhQBMXdQoYSFK2r1+kHWAsUcCBgwM8CeQayhNlAJQCA3zk+LtyAYbLmDF8oJz0DQUFDtasUeBBsZo8Rvj0GcBkBueVH7JwmU2bS5fXSt0sWXPggIMQO91FYcCgAQLcKzFwwcK8uZnbyJN22F2kyJrSw374kGNEBQ8L0VeqINO8uZgC4ZVeeXAgQAAOcECZMMBEDgEA6VcWEFOeORkV+Sn1hgLu9XAHJnPQ4YMBMhwXoEpdmNEfFlwQ8KBSMazRQw8H7FHJDzI00EBJF6YEQBYTYpHFZiUm9UAAGwInSRsE7ONgiycpN6EZX+ColB9F0EADFZHYEQQBM4CH1P8HmTXZJItHqRDGhGJc0CSJLDHp5Jb4jYWCAzQIUMMjSGAQBJRHffBFFmy26eabWXRRQANdolQAGBOSAWebFwxg4UkL7Ckom10M0IBSQAgggAONzCAEBmIpRcByKVZqBhhcfAEgSl1sUWmKNGyhRRldkGjAlJ9OuAUYXnRxKFIjCOAEo4psI8SNSY2X6qdbeAFBlyfu+ikYY2AgxQB4CqtqGQMkNYITTuCQSAoitIBmUhDwp2yKYUBgEgZebJsiGrdd4Km45dHgRbNIrQEtdoX84ctkZX0hIbr9eQGglPjm2wCK/TZHQxl/HhWAEwIsYEg/9JIVW8DlbdHjnRAzp8X/BeFWjIUY0B3VgaxjEpICAh/UOdakO8I5xhnaTugFAZ1OyMWbY3CBRopaZIFqxHCWcca5E5aBJUsKQJsGId7gOpau/YnhLUoLNNAFeRNqwQDA/a2IEgYNfBFB1VloUTW7gBrwRbL9hWGAUjTMOsgfACCgZFnZ5rmpiVl83XQWGZfH40oQAN1czoIzd8baKn0wBs53H7UEtAqrIYIFJpNlr8wFpxS4qjpT+XRKMfd3RhY0BG3sSqGXp0XjLHUA7Q2CsJBQXw9POMa1J23eHxpZoN3cfyoFG3QZE9KQxVGpD846S0W4rUY4c5OFcn8R9MjS5f0RjrlK4BafxRmqXnAU/9blAa8UB070IEgFlDFdHhqfp1R72uQ3d7tK/Pa3Rdhjs4QB8dtTCgWgJYgVUKZu2VueSQwAvqD1rTnV04/vmAOGLBQOC4djCQOo1p/7CZCAKbgC+/yCvfJUiCXJY04EOre7+J0khVgIA+lMtxIAeG1C5CLLAJ0gCBQYsC/C6yDujkWp7PWuassLYnm8AMB0HU8/HCxPGBS4kh0KogMoGCFZdES9J6LkAwXwQun6Q4MxfOGCJ0xJ9yb0vfBxDwJinFD1KncUK6phIVpcWhSZQy4V+FEFEOjCGLQwRtENoH7M8SBK8sczsWWvC38EZBfK4EiZUXEl6FPf8zpwhb7sR/9VWghlKMVwrxSJ4QsEeKAKvWinCWKhghcUlSi1QMphia8szaPVB97Qgb5ESGNo+MICToVDF5rEXBOSYSEDdsqhSed1gkiBBN7wQ6UosV/NPJYrrbYSRGKBiRoDgzD78jgnRO55EujlWNbYLxqcYZxSQGZ/uPCqramSOW0MWATOcAFnss15gnjBCSTQSaUwUlxmIMMYBlCnGXbQn8TUH//wZQYZMoCOSSmaE45GiCGc4A1joZj+ZjlLMnBhDIVCU6BIGkpWnkQFXGDp6C4oBpaG0qQoZcAQpQMyQ6TgBCdQJ1JgyIUL0IMeBfgjAfxpEkAe9aiZA9QAnkqPQy6TOV7/MOpRk+pHAux0LAdL2CGSEIMToAAp10wkU30khQU0sTxZwChy3OUEeBkiAWUtaHLuuUK2sqQBDYxYx/JTTmkpogR5ZclB+WhMv0qBAZVsDhjQE6By0moRiDWrBKvGAMeqRHdSvCRlNHpZRpRgAjHoQB6lQNR6etYkeXPZ6aLTgQNAq7SNSABqJaDFtGJhDGv10QIWx0a5+oUIPYCWYSOhhCdMQLNS+N8Wpktd3r3WntSlLhgG+xoFyEoAMprEC0DghxjwFgAFoCo9EHddKaBXvRBwLWWIcDAnRICjlkiAG1D7htW2168nsK1yQfGCKfgBtar9r19RwAFZOaEI+AWF/xL04IYD91fBJTrBGhzcg/CygwUUPrAEzorh8BzhAIoSQA9gpxgWgGAHbnBDDKhZYsr4gQMBCJMAAsBi0wgiCSUgwg5gPAEa1zgpEyBQD4QkJrv6eBApSIAedEAEIbshqP7F8BuOgOMNLbkIeHjBkxfxAinr4Mxn3sFHSXzdHRxBAe2B0YYOcAMPjfkRL0DAFIgAgz77mQh++KhQ8zMBIjwANNVxj6JxEAI735kSIhjCnilA6UpT+gh9rnCg38BpTkvg058GKlCJcGm2iKY3B6hOEQJwABxsIDGPFkYKPlACEFgBKlB5gK53PZUlrAUIbGkLYQpjmNCcujdFUAAVbjgwBDHHWjEpUAICPOCBDWwgLb4GdrDbQmzDcIAKIxiBFaxQgmY/+9yLEEEaEHAVdLv73fCOd7wDAQA7AA==" /&gt;
GeoIP services may not always work. I recommend that you follow the approach of other ecommerce websites, and simply prompt the user for their zip code. You should be able to reliably determine their state from that. 
Honest question: Why would you use this when there is PDO?
Yep, that's what I've been getting from doing the built-in package install, on more than 1 system I've gotten PHP 5.3. :)
The reasoning they put forward is analogous to why PDO exists, ODBC just happens to be older and more widely supported by database manufacturers.
Run phpinfo(), right-click on the logos and view the size of them. They're pretty small images. Looking at the code you linked, that's not a lot of data there either (with 10 bytes per line and rounding up to like 1080 lines, the high estimate there is 10k). 
Right - someone really should solve this app. I'm thinking JS + php,gd click drag, define field... etc. 
I've always wondered what kind of project really requires being able to work with any kind of database.
more importantly, how many?
I agree. Leaving it up to the user to enter the correctly matching text would be leaving room for error. Having a drop down field would be the way to go. You could wait until they enter their billing/mailing address and take the info and do the calculation from there.
Here's an example from my life. I work for a company that makes inspection machines that go inside of factories that produce circuit boards. I worked on a project that was a web interface to all the results data that these machines produce, generates graphs, spreadsheets, etc. This was written in PHP using PDO. Now, depending on the size of the factory or the application a different database vendor was used. Specifically, if they wanted long term storage and centralized, we gave them a big remote server with MySQL running. If this was a small customer and they only had one of our machines, then a localhost SQLite database was used. Why? Mainly because the installation and maintenance (none) of SQLite is "safer" to us, than MySQL when we don't need it, especially when these factories are on the other side of the world. So our PHP interface (and the inspection machines themselves in C++) were able to handle both db vendors. On the C++ side, the ODBC solution turned out to be too much hassle and wasn't working correctly, so we instead just abstracted out the db specific tasks and use the respective MySQL and SQlite binding for C/C++ 
Does IE support that now? Last time I checked it didn't.
Yeah Thanks guys this is what i mean going to do, just do a drop down with all the states thanks for the help!!
I freelance, and I am getting more and more work every month. This month I am making the most Ive ever made(in one month time), and I just recently set that bar higher in Feb of this year. If I could make as much money as I am making this month, I would be making 50k+ year, working at my leisure from home. Sadly my average for the last 2 years has been 1.6k/month. OH and I should mention, I build all sorts of websites, but in the last 6 months I have taken on more PHP oriented projects, versus before I was just building sites with CMS, html/css etc. So the increase in money has definitely been attributed to PHP. BTW I am also self taught, no college degree. I am 21, have been working freelance since highschool (5 years, 2 years php), and building websites as a hobby for even longer.
Are you serious? Anyone out there worth there salt wants to learn and grow. Its like being really ugly and dating a hot girl for 6 months. If she gave you a chance and you cant satisfy her needs shes gonna move on if something better comes along. 
Its called the internet! I relocated to greener pastures, but I was able to do work all over the US while I lived in Michigan during the auto crisis. Clients in New York, Chicago, LA, pretty much any major city with a shit ton of work to be done
well, python is a full blown development language.... php is designed to run on top of a server/database stack (i.e., LAMP), so of course it's much easier to develop simple websites. but if i went for a complex mvc framework, i'd prefer to write in python over php. i'd like to see php do the non-web things python can do, i.e., numpy :/
 You're often correct technically.. but that doesn't make a constructive comment
you dont actually want to do that live nor in SQL.
I'd argue that we don't need it to.
i highly doubt you had learned all you could in your self-described less than 6 month stint at company before you chose to shift to a new one. you set a bad precedent by doing that shit. but kudos to you, if you don't give a shit. ...all about the benjamins, i guess...
I made a system which does that very thing, converts PDF to various quality of images and provides a UI to define regions of various types. It also extracts objects (like links, videos) which were embedded with InDesign and Acrobat (or any other PDF authoring software); I could add support to extract PDF forms too I guess. Anyway... it's closed source, not used for processing forms and not available for licensing.... 
[This Stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2648/what-php-framework-would-you-choose-for-a-new-application-and-why) has some good info
I personally would use codeigniter for what you need. It's loosely OO, and has extremely good documentation, so it's easy to pick up. It doesn't have a "bake" feature built in, ~~but I've heard that [Code Crafter](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Category:Advanced::CRUD/) is a good generator, if you're going to use one.~~ Strike that, it's outdated... Since you are going to have a login, I'll warn you that CI stores all session data in the cookie... Either use the native sessions plugin or code accordingly.
You might be wanting something more tried and tested than this, but I'll throw it out there anyway since it's perfectly suited for the kind of thing you're doing. [phPit Foundation Framework](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/phPit) phPit is a framework I wrote over the past 3-4 years and is what I build almost all my sites in. It offers a basic url-&gt;controller mapping scheme, a simple user authentication setup, and (most importantly for you) a really easy to use CRUD database object. Simply subclass the DBRecord object with the table name and (optionally) primary keys, and away you go. Records are loaded like so: $record = new dFoo($primaryid); You then work with $record as if it were a named array. Call `$record-&gt;save();` to update/insert the row. Unfortunately there's not much written documentation, but the main classes are all fully commented. The DBRecord object was also just recently rewritten to use PDO and hasn't received as much usage as the old mysql_ version, so there may be some fringe cases I haven't caught yet.
Give this a try, it's close to DJB's perfect minimum hash. The difference being PHP doesn't understand unsigned int so I've used gmp but you won't get any of the unsigned int wrapping. $strings[] = "This is a test"; $strings[] = sprintf("%s/%s", 123, join("/", array(4,5,6))); $strings[] = sprintf("%s/%s", 123, join("/", array(3,5,6))); function gmp_shiftl($x, $n) { return (gmp_mul($x, gmp_pow(2, $n))); } function djbHash($string) { $hash = gmp_init(5381); foreach(preg_split("//", $string) as $char) { if ($char != "") { $hash = gmp_add(gmp_add(gmp_shiftl($hash, 5), $hash), gmp_init(ord($char))); } } return gmp_intval($hash) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF; } foreach ($strings as $string) { print "djb =&gt; " . $string . " =&gt; " . djbHash($string) . "\n"; } 
I think it would be worthwhile for you to look at [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/). It has an admin panel, user accounts, and a number of other things included. I came to Joomla after extensive use of CodeIgniter and Kohana as well as a few months of working with Django and I have found it extremely useful. I ported over a couple of projects from Kohana without much trouble. 
http://www.slimframework.com/ -&gt; https://github.com/codeguy/Slim i combined it with ActiveMongo and a controller autoloader. works awesome. esp the mongodb active record part.
Well, if Cake is too complicated for you, maybe you can just use a piece of it?
Don't take this the wrong way, but I wish you had just written a blog post and submitted that instead. All that code makes your post hard to follow. Try indenting the code with 4 spaces to switch it to "code view". &lt;?php $like-&gt;this(); ?&gt;
I'll recommend [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com). It comes with all the features you need. You can generate your CRUDs with gii. Tutorial that might help: [Quickstart](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/quickstart.first-app) - [Chapter about gii](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/quickstart.first-app#implementing-crud-operations)
Indented code. &lt;? $apikey = "YOURAPIKEY"; // Your exact API Key $themessage = ""; // The text message to send $sendto = "4801234567"; // Send to this number, numbers ONLY // dont edit anything below unless youre familiar with PHP $encoded = base64_encode($themessage); $replacewith = array("+", "="); $replacers = array("7PLUS7", "7EQUALS7"); $themsg = str_replace($replacewith, $replacers, $encoded); $pingapi = file_get_contents("http://www.textandvoicemail.com/api.php?key=$apikey&amp;to=$sendto&amp;msg=$themsg"); if ( $pingapi == "sent" ) { echo "Message Sent!"; } else { echo "Message not sent (&lt;b&gt;$pingapi&lt;/b&gt;)"; } ?&gt;
Agreed and omg I know you!
Maybe this is new in 2.0, not sure (I haven't really used CI prior to 2.0) but it does have config options for storing the session in the db.
I've really been liking CI too. The code is really clean. Not qualified to opine on the session issue yet, though.
Wow really awesome and thanks for open sourcing it! I tried to break it and failed. No use of exec() or shell_exec() or any of the alternatives worked. Good job!
Thanks! I figured it's a pretty useful app, and I've been using a really really cut back version in my development environment for years, so I figured it'd be something actually useful to give back to the community
[Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) may be worth exploring.
passing http urls in file_get_contents, as well as curl_exec is disabled. Got stuck after that =)
I love me some Redbean atm... $x=R::dispense('tableName'); $x-&gt;property=$whatever; $x-&gt;store(); It also creates the schema for you (unless you set the production flag, which makes it faster).
I'm going to update this comment whenever I fix some server-type settings, like disabling php functions etc Changes: * added DirectoryIterator and RecursiveDirectoryIterator and GlobIterator and FileSystemIterator (crikey) to disable_classes
I hereby apologize for overriding all earlier renders with "not what you expected, is it?" ;). Seems pretty solid now though.
I was watching like big brother and patched that quick smart :-) Thanks! That SPL extension seems pretty dangerous when you don't look at it too closely
Do we know when we break it because it wounds up on "rendering.... " ? I wrote $handle = popen("ls 2&gt;&amp;1", 'r'); $output = ""; while( !feof($handle) ) { $output .=fread($handle,4096); } Then i changed to $handle = popen("ls"." 2&gt;&amp;1", 'r'); die('halt here, i dunno if i broke it or not, sorry'); and saw the message :) Warning: popen() has been disabled for security reasons in /render/4de24e8000073 on line 3 halt here, i dunno if i broke it or not, sorry Edit: Btw, nice work dude :)
I haven't really handled HTTP errors in the AJAX calls to the render script, so if it just sits at Rendering... it could mean that it's either still running, or has given a non-200 HTTP response (500 usually, since suhosin kills a lot of stuff for me). The easiest way to figure out if it's still running or just error'd out is using Firebug or Chrome's debug tools to watch the network requests (heh, easy :-p) I'll make a note of that to fix for the future!
Tried really hard to break it with not really a lot of success! I was able to snoop around a little within the web root via `readfile` and `__FILE__` and `/var/www/render.php` etc, and can view loaded functions with `get_defined_functions`. I noticed if you put `while (true) { print "blah"; }` into a file it just sits there saying "Rendering" and I tried a lot of variations to try and keep the script running and push the memory usage up but nothing seemed to work. Good job!
Thanks! I did spot a case where sleeping between outputting lots of data inside an infinite loop will keep outputting data, since the sleep is causing the max_execution_time to never really hit the limit, so I'll probably add something to nuke long-running processes.
Paradox barely has column types, let alone type constraints. Paradox has indexing, but not explicit indexing. (Indeed, as far as I know, the only SQL vendors that currently implement explicit indexing are oracle and ibm db2.) Foxpro never had type constraints or explicit indexing either. As far as SQLite, SQLite doesn't even have column types. "What? Of course it does." Think so? People are often surprised to find out how it actually works. Try creating a table with an integer column, and then inserting a string into it. Select * from that table, and watch with your jaw at the floor when SQLite returns a string from your table with one integer column. It also attempts type conversions in a poorly defined rank-guessing system which will make you shit your pants while screaming "shenanigans". http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html Turns out that not everything works the way you assume it works, and sometimes people pick examples that seem contrary to intuition *for* *a* *reason*, and that your bullshit sensor isn't going off because they're wrong, but because they triggered it on purpose to remind you that not everything is as it seems from the perspective of someone who's been doing this for less than ten years. I think maybe you didn't realize that "explicit index" means something different than index, and that "type constraints" means something different than "a column that has a type." Explicit indexing means atomic index changes, which is a rare, high end, high durability feature: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/tividd/td/ASE/ASE50trg/en_US/PDF/ASE50trg.pdf Type constraints means "things in this column may be an int or a string or a bool, but not anything else." It's like a specified multi-type. Very few databases implement this. (Some people argue that MySQL enum is a type constraint; I do not agree, but some very smart people take that position.) Sadly, I am once again downvoted by someone who tells me I'm wrong about the examples I chose for a reason, without asking me to clarify.
Couldn't break it. Enjoyable few minutes trying though :)
It did have that option in 1.7. Even with that option, it saves the session data in the cookie as well. It is a little safer, because if it notices the cookie has been modified, it will destroy the session. I just don't like the idea of having a session limited to 4kb(though I've never reached it) and all the data I have for that user being visible, and possibly editable. 
I came here to CTRL+f suhosin... Stefan Esser its maintainer === i0n1c the iOS hacker == awesome :-)
Oh wow, I've been looking for something like this so I can edit code on my server through the browser... did you use some other project for the live syntax highlighting or did you write that yourself? 
I bet you learned a lot building this! (or exercised quite well what you already knew) Relative beginners like me (CS degree + ~3-4 years - only 1.5 in professional environment though) get pretty cocky when we get a handle on the most basic of security stuff and our code starts looking clean and contains at least one clever bit of code... I doubt I could lock down security in an environment like this without learning a whole lot first. Great looking app!
I'm able to write into a file on your server and have the results parsed as HTML, thus beeing able to use JS (XSS, CSRF) http://www.tehplayground.com/#4de2620fd88f1 Will result in an alert with 'hello world' in it. Does that count as breaking it? :) Edit. Also, able to read your code: &gt; $_SESSION['haxor'] = "Nothing useful here, stop trying to hax me, bro!"; is a fun part ;) Edit2: clarification, that's from /var/www/index.php, not your git repo.
Ah, didn't realize that. Thanks for the info. 
Probably the best suggestion so far. Redbean is great and very lightweight. On the plus side, if you expand later and use another PHP framework it integrates great. 
Server no longer responding...
looks good. Codepad.org does this as well, and works with a ton of other languages too.
Thought it might be fun to use while on my iPad. Unfortunately it doesn't function. 
How do we test it, how do I run code in it?
I've just started with it, I'm kicking myself for not finding it earlier!
just type some code, then CTRL+ENTER.
Thank you.
Would guess the answer will be somewhere within this page but my guess is not. Why couldn't you do $testObject2 = clone $testObject1; http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.cloning.php
My code is running, but I get &gt; Warning: ob_end_clean() has been disabled for security reasons in /var/www/render.php on line 24 with the php code from here: http://blinguas.homelinux.net/pnopaste/?7 (which has only 14 lines). Then I fed it an infinite loop, and it just said "Rendering..." forever... while(1) { print "In loop!\n"; } I guess I didn't break it, though.
Well thats what the problem is, I need to be able to do that from within the object, that occurs from outside the object.
If you can't clone from outside, then the only alternative I could think of is grabbing the class properties (potentially using reflection) and then assigning them on the other class, in which case it would probably be easier to just wipe the second object and re-initialize it.
You can't reassign `$this` in PHP5. It was possible in PHP4, and actually SquirrelMail did this. *shudder* So the question really is, what are you trying to achieve? If you need an object to "become" something else so you have different functionality or have access to a particular method, that should be done via composition, e.g. [strategy pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern). Or, if you're trying to copy values from one model to another, take a look at [`get_object_vars`](http://php.net/get_object_vars). I made it a habit to have all my models provide `toArray()` and `setFromArray()` methods, for instance.
Six hours later and I can't access it. Appears broken!
Why not just grab the properties from the object passed as a parameter and copy them to your own? Do note that you might get a significantly better answer if you tell us why you are trying to do this. Chances are there's a better solution for what you are trying to accomplish. 
No offence, but you didn't open source much and what you did is (ew) GPL. The point of interest to most people would be the steps you took with the server configuration. Edit: I get downvoted for providing valid feedback? Get a thicker skin r/PHP.
That information is already available in the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php).
I thought about things like XSS and CSRF attacks (quite simple, really), but I figured they'd only be useful on a site that doesn't require user interaction to trigger and would also contain things like authentication cookies and stored credentials. If I'm wrong with this, feel free to correct me :-)
Thanks. I've never seen codepad before, and I wonder how he's rendering all those other languages - maybe I can expand!
Ah damn.. I only slapped this together on the weekend and tested on Chrome and Firefox - I'll have a look and clean it up for portables soonish
Yup, PHP segfaults pretty quickly inside infinite loops and crashes out, but I'm not handling the non-200 response code, so it just sits at 'Rendering...'
Once I'm happy that I've built a nice and secure environment for the code to live in, I'll be adding example configs and a recommended hosting setup into the repo as well - I just didn't want to put that in until I trusted it. The only other license I can think of to share this under would have been a Creative Commons Share and Share Alike or whatever it's called these days - if you can recommend a better one, please do! I'm sadly fairly removed from the open source world these days
Well, I ran this little test to make sure I can keep it online for an extended period, and it's looking pretty good, so I hope you continue to get some use out of it! :-D For the live syntax highlighting editor I'm using the [Ace Cloud 9 IDE Editor](http://ace.ajax.org)
Then why don't you just ask nicely? I'm sure the OP might be accommodating.
Awesome, thanks :) 
I wasn't asking, I was providing feedback.
I just noticed the "Posted by" blurb is different on the main list than it is on a individual post. Changing line 31 in /application/views/blog/posts.php to this will fix it: echo "&lt;p class=\"info\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"author\"&gt;Posted by $first_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"; There's also an extra closing paragraph tag on line 29. Since categories don't seem to work for me, I've just left it as it is.
MIT or BSD, don't force people to release the source of their software just because they've used part or all of yours to build it unless you really mean it. The end result is that fewer people (probably no one) will actually use it.
`$_GET["the fuck out"]` That was harsh, but seriously, cool story bro.
I took it as you getting stuck on a point (the server config) as if it were information that would never be provided. Others might be unhappy about your jab at the GPL. Personally I think you have a good point, just worded disagreeably. I upvoted you, I'd like to know what you don't like about the GPL though?
Neither of those licenses protect the free state of the code. I don't ever intend on having my work or any derivative of my work commercialised.
Same for infinite recursive loops I assume: function hey($i) { echo $i; hey($i + 1); } hey(1);
Yup! It's been a "problem" for a long time: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15522
 generateTerrain($arr, $x, $y, $newWidth, $newHeight, $c1, $edge1, $midPoint, $edge4); generateTerrain($arr, $x + $newWidth, $y, $newWidth, $newHeight, $edge1, $c2, $edge2, $midPoint); generateTerrain($arr, $x + $newWidth, $y + $newHeight, $newWidth, $newHeight, $midPoint, $edge2, $c3, $edge3); generateTerrain($arr, $x, $y + $newHeight, $newWidth, $newHeight, $edge4, $midPoint, $edge3, $c4); Needs to be: $arr = generateTerrain($arr, $x, $y, $newWidth, $newHeight, $c1, $edge1, $midPoint, $edge4); $arr = generateTerrain($arr, $x + $newWidth, $y, $newWidth, $newHeight, $edge1, $c2, $edge2, $midPoint); $arr = generateTerrain($arr, $x + $newWidth, $y + $newHeight, $newWidth, $newHeight, $midPoint, $edge2, $c3, $edge3); $arr = generateTerrain($arr, $x, $y + $newHeight, $newWidth, $newHeight, $edge4, $midPoint, $edge3, $c4); Or you could pass $arr by reference
Heh when I saw the basedir restriction message it gave away where the code was hiding (the /var/www bit) and so I also did a `print readfile('/var/www/index.php');` and snooped around a little before realising it was open source :P
I think I broke it, I assume you're using a FastCGI setup, hence spamming CTRL+Enter with this code causes each PHP process to run it at once meaning there's no FastCGI spawns left to respond to users. &lt;?php ignore_user_abort(true); // gc_disable(); for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; $i++) { // syslog(LOG_EMERG, str_repeat("hello", 500)); apc_add('hax'.$i, str_repeat("hello", 500)); print str_repeat("hello", 5); } ~~Also I apologise for spamming your syslog if that's really working~~.. my goal was to Out of Memory the machine if possible. I'm going to stop now! Sorry! *Edit: Appears to be responding, hopefully all is well again :)*
$_POST["haste"]
Hmm, I can't see any OOM kills, and syslog is in the disable_functions list so that wouldn't have done much, although lighttpd did seem to stop accepting requests - so that's interesting Don't worry about breaking it, this whole exercise is to learn how to secure it properly so that I can leave it up without much ado about monitoring, and provide a somewhat useful service (eventually)
Ah, do you have an error_log from lighttpd? Perhaps it was filling up with all of the warning messages, making it halt from all the IO? If you do figure out what caused it to stop responding I'd love to hear, but thanks for the opportunity none the less!
There's nothing in the error logs but fcgi bitching about the process dying (which is usually php seg faulting) All PHP output from rendered code gets sent to the browser... I don't really want to log those errors - would result in fairly large log files
echo '&lt;form method="POST" action="'.$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].'#'.$_REQUEST['id'].'" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="code" id="code"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit!"&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" id="id" name="id" value="'.$_REQUEST['id'].'"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;'; creates a form that can cause some trouble...
No worries then, I did at one point DoS myself while playing around with output buffering, sending long strings of compressed repetitive data only to be uncompressed in my browser and OOM'd myself ;)
Add pcntl_fork() to the list of disabled functions, or even the whole extension.
Tried some APC churning by running three simultaneous instances of: while (true) { $n = rand(10e16, 10e20); $key = base_convert($n, 10, 36); $n = rand(10e16, 10e20); $val = base_convert($n, 10, 36); apc_add($key, $val); print_r(apc_sma_info()); } echo 'Done'; After the third instance I couldn't get any response from a fourth instance running `print_r(apc_sma_info());`. Now I'm getting no response at all. Did I break it or is it just coincidence?
Thanks!
Looks like you broke it! Good job.
Certainly seems broken! I think all the php-cgi children have stalled - which is curious since there's eight children and they all look idle EDIT: I've hardened up the fcgi confs a little and retried your description and can't replicate the crash now, so that's looking a bit better - keep working at it though!
Awesome! I tried a dozen other things with no success, so kudos to you sir.
You are going to want to read up on your SQL join commands. Doing this in PHP is really not the way you want to do this. It would be a waste of your relational database features at hand. Not to mention extra work for both the PHP server and database server. http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp
Now would I be able to put that into a $name= thing? I currently am loading columns from one table to put into an html table doing it, $f1 -$f12. If I made $f13= Could I do a sql join and then php echo it into the table? And I also only one to select one column once the it matches the ID. What would be the way to do that?
Javlin is correct. Your sql join will prevent any non-matching rows from appearing in your results. Hence, you print every user to appear in your results.
You don't need to use an API that costs money for this. Just look up the [email address formats of each provider](http://www.emailtextmessages.com/).
Ahhh, after reading more about the SQL Join I understand it better and is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Jav for bringing that up. And this is why I love reddit. Very nice people who are quick to help. And I wasn't flamed in the process. Now it's just figuring out how to use it properly. Thank you again. Edit: Now the problem I'm reading by this, is sadly the one column in t1 is User_ID and in td just straight ID. Would a join still be possible? I've tried it a few times and so far nothing.
Yep, that's excellent thank-you! I've had a bit of a crack at implementing a simplified MVC design like in your example and got it working. In my current site I have a 'library' directory with all of my classes and methods in it. I guess these are library functions for the website as a whole, so can be used by any file in my site. Am I right in thinking that the MonsterModel.php probably wouldn't be used by any controllers unless they were called MonsterController or MonsterControllerEdit? Like if I wanted BirdController for example do use some function that was in the MonsterModel class, I should really pull that method out and make a generic one for the BaseModel.php or make a class/method for it in the overall library? Guess I'm trying to figure out the distinction between what should be in the library and what should be in the BaseModel or BaseController. Also I understand you have one controller file for every path e.g. "/user/edit/" or "/user/add/". Do you have just one UserModel.php file so all those paths/actions could use the same model? If that's the case, does that file get quite large/unwieldy?
An option would be to extend the class and call the parent constructor or inherited function.
First off rather that trying it in PHP I would recommend first experimenting with the SQL is some sort of SQL command program. (I don't know what you are using since you didn't say, or I would be more specific.) It doesn't matter if the names are different, you can still join them: SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.User_ID = t2.ID; or you can use the older (SQL86) method of writing this: SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.User_ID = t2.ID; But I recommend you learn and use the new method (SQL92). If the names were the same then you would do: SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (User_ID);
The source code is pretty ugly =/
Is this your site?
I'm teaching my gf php, this service will be very convenient for that, thanks!
Nice, this would of have been handy for me last year some time when I was trying to show a list of articles on a blog, but only show the first 200 or so chars.
It's not UTF-8 safe, though. It can cut a character like ä in half causing it to show up as an invalid character.
I think you are more likely to see improvements being offered back if you offer an unrestricted license as people are likely to actually build something with it.
Just use unicode preg modifier, and the mb_ functions for string handling (e.g., instead of substr use mb_substr). If your code isn't unicode-safe in this day and age then it's pretty much useless for most purposes.
You'd have to use the [multibyte functions](http://dk.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php) to ensure you're counting actual characters and not bytes.
Thank you. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to work when I was typing it, but editing the SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.User_ID = t2.ID; worked. I was actually working on this in Notepad++. I was trying to call the join with $query="SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.User_ID = t2.ID;"; Then calling them with $f1=mysql_result($result,$i,"name"); And echoing the result into a table. I got it to work. Thank you very much!
This is gonna break when someone has a "&gt;" inside an attribute value (perfectly legal). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454
their api isn't very good looking though.
How many messages can you send. Looking at their site, you get 25 messages for free...is that it?
I like it. I am thinking about developing a micro learning management system in PHP and am looking for a simple and small PHP framework to build it on. As I want to focus my developing time on creating interactive simulations and assignments, I am looking for a framework that is easy to use yet powerful enough to support a growing and evolving system. That is to say I want a framework that gets out of my way, yet flexible enough to enable me to understand and change the inner workings of the framework when needed. I will start out with maybe a teacher or two and their pupils (say 60 of them) and some 10 lessons with a lot of assignments, problems, and the like. However, after an initial testing period, the system should be able to grow. Would you say your phPit framework is up to this task? Do you have any tips before I start developing with phPit?
If you're trying to populate your form with data from your objects, then you're looking for the populate method. Something like: $form = new Application_Form_MyForm(); $blahs = array(); foreach ($model-&gt;getBlahs() as $blah) //Blah models { $blahs[] = $blah-&gt;getId(); } $form-&gt;populate(array( 'name' =&gt; $model-&gt;getName(), 'blah' =&gt; $blahs, )); If you need to populate your data objects with data from your form, then you need to do something like: $form = new Application_Form_MyForm(); $request = $this-&gt;getRequest(); if ($request-&gt;isPost() &amp;&amp; $form-&gt;isValid($request-&gt;getPost())) { $model = new Application_Model_User(); $model-&gt;setId($id); $model-&gt;setName($form-&gt;getValue('name'); foreach ($form-&gt;getValue("blah") as $bId) { $blah = new Application_Model_Blah(); $blah-&gt;setId($bId); $model-&gt;addBlah($blah); } $mapper-&gt;save($model); }
the problem is that I don't have an Application_Form_MyForm. I'm writing this form in one of the views to keep myself from having to use who knows how many decorators in order to use it in the form of tables. I posted the question with the markup and input names as they really are in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6179153/how-should-i-implement-this-mapper-method-to-retrieve-the-right-information) for more information
Well, if you need the post data, just retrieve it using: $this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getPost() Remember that you need to validate the input before using it. Still, you haven't sufficiently explained what it is you are trying to do, how, and why. That makes it hard to help you. As for your method, the issue is blatantly clear. You're looping through the values, each time overwriting the last one (since you're using set&lt;Whatever&gt;($value);). Also, you're splitting your keys on the "\_", and all your form names are formatted as "directorios_&lt;whatever here&gt;". The set method will therefore always evaluate to setDirectorios($value), and the property will always be overwritten with the last value you feed it. If you want your data added in the format you've described (which is most likely the wrong solution), then the setOptions method is completely useless, and you could just do this directly: $obj-&gt;setDirectorios($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getPost());
I'm sorry. What I'm trying to do is to have this information available so I can easily use it with the mapper methods(find, fetchAll, save, update). I would like to also be able to use the setters and getters of the model...in this case setDirectorios. for that reason I need setOptions to be able to efficiently create an array with this form: array(directorio_url( 0 =&gt; url1.com, 1 =&gt; url2.com ), directorio_kword( 0 =&gt; 'blah', 1 =&gt; 'blah' ), directorio_link( 0 =&gt; 'http://test.com/link', 1 =&gt; 'http://test2.com/link2' ) )
1. That'd be a bad solution. 2. I've already explained how to do that. 3. You haven't explained *why* you're trying to do that. 
I'm not completely sure how I should work the CRUD of a relational database. In this case, each of those tables corresponds to an actual table in the database which is also linked to a user_has_links kind of table to link directorios, rss, articulos,..etc. I need an easy way to do this and I thought a mapper was the way to go. That's why I need the setOptions method which will make it more "manageable" or so I think...
&gt; Would you say your phPit framework is up to this task? I'd like to think it's up to this task. :) I've tried to stay very humble with this project since I'm the only developer working on it. Without peer review I am never sure if the way I'm doing things is the best way. It seems like I'm always finding new ways to do things and making massive improvements. The Autoloader class is an example of that -- leaving the __autoload() function behind in favor of spl_autoload_register() was an idea I found in a stackoverflow thread. It was a pretty big change, but I immediately saw the advantages. You'll notice that phPit doesn't have version numbers. It's a constantly growing/constantly changing beast. This is probably its biggest stumbling block as far as major acceptance goes, since there's never a clear upgrade path. &gt; That is to say I want a framework that gets out of my way This is exactly what my goal has been on phPit. Very few forced conventions outside of the file system, and low overhead on individual requests; just handle the url mapping, provide an autoload mechanic, setup the session, and then let the controller do the rest. Even the Controller-&gt;View relationship is not enforced; most of my own controllers have view code in them, separating business logic and presentation code by an invisible line in the file (usually when I instantiate the Page class). &gt; Do you have any tips before I start developing with phPit? Read through all the main files before you start any serious work with it. While the formal documentation is sparse, I've tried to document the code itself as best as I can, and always write clear code (I'm a firm believer of the "your code should document itself" mentality). Don't be afraid to delete things, as well. phPit has been my boiler-plate for several years, so there's a lot of stuff in there that other developers probably won't find as useful (such as the extra CSS files). The only required object is Autoloader and the contents of the paths file, and the only required controllers are 404.php and index.php. Everything else *should* be optional.
Models are supposed to be big. They are commonly called on by controllers that aren't immediately relevant. For example... class PlayerModel extends BaseModel { // A list of damage types and the types of monsters they're effective against public $damageTypes = array( "fire" =&gt; array( "undead", "demon" ), "melee" =&gt; array( "undead" ), "electric" =&gt; array( "dwarves", "demons" ) ); // Get the player class so we can determine which monsters they're effective against public function fetchClass($playerID) { ... } } Here, a controller might now be forced to call both the player class *and* monster class in the same procedure, perhaps to do some comparisons (is this monster weak against this player class or damage type, etc). This is completely typical and you'd be hard pressed to do any kind of real work without initializing multiple classes. Models may even talk to each other. In the above example, *PlayerModel* might want to fetch a list of monster types from *MonsterModel*. However, you should be aware that creating dependencies between models creates tight coupling, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your use case. Use your best judgment to determine which things will rarely change, and which things have a high likelihood of changing. In my case, Library just contains the F3 Fat Free framework, since it's just a bunch of static methods wrapped in a class. If you did end up putting stuff in the library, my *guess* is that it would be a bunch of application-oblivious methods that solve common problems, like maybe a logging class or a method that does performance analysis. BaseModel and BaseController contain methods that can be shared between all their respective children, and it makes sense to put them there. A method that only handles monster data should be put in MonsterModel, but a property array of typical game configurations might be delegated to the BaseModel because those configurations are inherent in every child. In my applications, BaseController has a lot of template configurations. For example... class RootController { // Meta Information public $author = "huckfinnaafb"; public $copyright = "Copyright huckfinnaafb 2011. All Rights Reserved."; public $description = "Site description and stuff! Yeah man!"; public $direction = "ltr"; public $keywords = "butts, big butts, mighty fine butts, bubbly butts"; public $language = "en"; public $title = "Butts, butts, and bigger, finer butts."; // Page Assets public $scripts = array('jquery', 'butts'); public $styles = array('style'); // Common Properties public $dateform = "l\, F jS Y"; public function render($file, $layout = true) { if ($layout) { include (F3::get('GUI') . "layout.php"); } else { include (F3::get('GUI') . "nolayout.php"); } } } The purpose for this is mostly organization - of course you could stick every method and property in the same class, but it would be a nightmare to browse through, you'd have to fight with finding unique names for things, and a new programmer would likely run away at the sight of the thing. Just as well, sometimes I like to build a model that returns itself (an object), with all the relevant properties. For example, this is a model I've written which returns itself and all its parameters in a JSON encoded string, which is later decoded (or not) depending on how the controller wants to handle it. https://github.com/huckfinnaafb/Leviatha/blob/master/application/models/LootModel.php Feel free to look through the rest of that project, although it is a heavy work in progress.
&gt; if ($input==**strip_tags($input)**) return substr($input,0,$length); //if there's no html we don't have to do all this fancy junk Uh.. strip_tags isn't really free, you know. Try benchmarking (profiling) and find if the check is actually useful.

&gt; You'll notice that phPit doesn't have version numbers. It's a constantly growing/constantly changing beast. This is probably its biggest stumbling block as far as major acceptance goes, since there's never a clear upgrade path. As long as there is improvement and evidence of someone looking after it, I would not worry about acceptance. There are a lot of programmers out there that can use a clear piece well tended code. What I like about your framework most is the bare view-component. I like to do things my way, often in different ways in different parts of a web site. Of course I want some consistent look and feel and some navigation, but the rest should be open to the user. &gt; Read through all the main files before you start any serious work with it. While the formal documentation is sparse, I've tried to document the code itself as best as I can, and always write clear code (I'm a firm believer of the "your code should document itself" mentality). I've read most of the top parts of your files and most look well-documented to me. Furthermore, and more importantly, the code is readable! What more can a programmer wish for? &gt; Don't be afraid to delete things, as well. phPit has been my boiler-plate for several years, so there's a lot of stuff in there that other developers probably won't find as useful So I can delete the prototype and related JS Frameworks and/or substitute my own? I would like to thank you for your work and making it available to boot!
Its cool! I like it! I would recommend doing something about the urls for snippets. I just put myurl.com without the http://www. and it followed it as a local link. Should be a pretty easy fix. Is the source code available?
Thanks man. That will definitely be going into the next version! Great suggestion I will release the source code after its all tidied up, I guess people could install it locally on their server as a depository of snippets etc! Going by your name on reddit, your username on [Snipit](http://glensm.com/snipit/) must be the OFWGKTA inspired one :)
&gt; So I can delete the prototype and related JS Frameworks and/or substitute my own? Go right ahead, you can ditch everything in there if you don't want to use it. Just be sure to delete the related calls in the Page object constructor (if you decide to use the Page object), otherwise you'll get a bunch of broken script tags.
Read this: http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/from_flat_php_to_symfony2.html It's one of my favorite posts on MVC and the evolution from flat PHP to modular PHP.
Hi Looks good. Only critique at first glance is I'm always wary of signing up to something without knowing what it's all about. A bit more info on the splash/ intro screen would go far as the screen caps dont do it for me Good work though!
Thanks. I agree, I wasn't sure how to fit it onto the page but I will add a "feature tour" on the front page. Good point!
*What if* I want to test an RSS snippet, or show people how you can chmod or zip files from php? What if I want to show people how someone could potentially do damage, if the input is not properly sanitized? What if I want to show people that database connection does not work from remote area at all? Limiting everything is the easiest, and yet quite the wrong way to go with this, unless you only want it to be used for simple beginner problems (explaining arrays, classes, etc). I want to challenge you to create a solution that would allow people to run PHP code with full control of the machine. E.g. create a pool of LXC containers that die either after the browser session times out, or RAM, CPU, Disk IO or Network IO quota is reached. Instances themselves are created from a stable snapshot and always reverted to the initial version. **The good thing is: **LXC is extremely low overhead technology. **The bad thing is: ** Each instance would have to have their own PHP and Lighttpd on them. A rough assumption is that each would require 32-64 MB of RAM. (not counting LXC overhead, which I do not know). I'm however positive that m1.large would be able to easily serve half a hundred concurrent sessions. Also, If you do this the *easy way*, I'm sure someone would highly appreciate if you'd put the config ini on github or somewhere.. Thumbs up for caring about PHP security though.
Was about to comment very similarly, however I have privacy concerns and cannot open this up as a service. Where is the code / can I host one myself? Basically if I'm investing into a tool like this I have to be certain: * I can keep my information secure (not that I don't trust you, but you won't be liable for data loss as I am) * I can keep hosting or migrate my data out of the system if you no longer wish to provide the service or are not technically able
Originally I set out to create an app in a weekend, so I wasn't concentrating on a public release of the code. I plan on releasing the source code out soon with the aim of allowing people to have their own local hosted Snipit and to scrutinize it further. Allowing the user to download all their data sounds like a good and simple feature. Thanks for your feedback KayRice.
 $_FILES["shredded"]
just turn it into phpfiddler like jsfiddler. that would be awesome.
This guy is a shill for this paid textandvoicemail.com service. I've reported both posts and sent a message to the mods. It's just spam. Carefully crafted spam, but spam nonetheless.
I agree. Ideally, you'd be able to do absolutely everything that PHP is capable of in a proper sandbox environment. This is kinda why I put the source up on github for everyone to see - if you want to use it for a grander purpose that my extremely limited hosting setup allows, you can just fork it, run it locally and test a whole bunch of stuff. This would be useful on things like a corporate intranet where you trust the local users etc. I initially thought of architecting a system that would spin up virtual machines (probably UML, never heard of LXC - looks interesting though!) as needed and have them each heavily segregated and locked down, but still allow the majority of PHP code to function. The primary thing prohibiting this is simply money - I'm running this on a t1.micro instance completely sitting within Amazon's Free Tier. The only thing costing me money is the three js/css files that I'm hosting via S3/Cloudfront. The other thing to consider would be in instances where people may want to test things that require access to the outside world, such as those you suggested: pulling RSS snippet, checking a database connection etc... If I have granted access to the internet to do those, I'd also be granting access to do things like use my hosted tool for a DoS origin, spam hub and so forth. For now, I think that it still fills a fairly nice niche of allowing you to test out basic prototypes. I can already see some examples of actual prototyping in some of the stored render files: PHP5 classes w/ test data, testing strtotime against different text values, testing string sanitzation functions - this is what I wrote it for, and I'm happy to see it getting that use. Having said all that (damn wall of text) if it becomes financially viable for me to build a tougher, but more feature-full solution, I definitely will take up your challenge - it sounds like fun!
With regards to the downvote, I'm not in any way affiliated with them, just asking if anyone has ever tried this framework. My title probably sounded like a promotion, sorry about that.
Don't know if this will fix it, but you are missing a closing &lt;/tr&gt; tag in your getPosts() function. Plus I would also suggest doing a view source and make sure your html is not missing any more closing tags. 
ya it looks like i'm not even getting any of the getPosts() function tags. I fixed the missing tag then looked at the page source and all of my information is in &lt;p&gt; tags. any idea? thanks for the tips so far!
You really should place session_start as close to the top as possible. That way it is there for you to access both for storage or retrieval as needed. It will not work if anything has already been sent back to the requestor/browser Table-wise, I tend to pull the results into an associative array above the html and foreach them in the body of the html. This way you can eventually move your data retrieval from your view into a controller and basically do this via copy/paste.
&gt; I was also having trouble using the header('Location: xxx.php"). Try output buffering (ob_start() , ob_end_flush() )
Are you sure your changing the correct file then? No way something would change table elements to &lt;P&gt;. Are you using Chrome Inspector / Firebug to view the source, or just plain old Ctrl+U?
Ok, i've been trying to put them as close to the top as possible, the tutorials i've been watching have been putting the session_start in the body of the html, and when i do that i get errors, so i've been putting it above the start of the html. And in terms of the tables, what do you mean to pull the results into and associative array, and then foreach them in the body? 
I'm using chrome inspector. i am honestly so confused, haven't done much of this, so it's not easy to get anywhere. I followed a tutorial to get this far, but really lost now. Any chance you can explain this bit: &gt;"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;" . $post['Title'] . "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" . $post['Author'] . "&gt;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"delete.php?id=" . $post['ID'] . "\"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br &gt;/&gt;&lt;a href=\"edit.php&gt;?id=" . $post['ID'] . "\"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;"; I'm not sure why he had us put in the \, and seemingly random quotes. any help is appreciated. &lt;
Figured it out, it was a different file that was named the same thing. fuck me. Thank you very much, took a while to figure that stupid one out.
You're using \" to "escape the quote". When using: echo "hello, I'm a string"; The double quote is used as a special char pointing the end of string. If you'd use something like: echo "hello, I'm "also" a string"; You'd get a parse error - PHP would see: 1) a string *hello, I'm * 2) a token *also* 3) another string * a string* And would have no idea what to do. You can add a backslash to number of characters to display them / display special characters, eg: echo "hello, I'm \"also\" a string"; Tells the parser that the second double quote is in fact a character to display, not a flow control element. Also usefull are: echo "\$a"; Witch would display *$a*, not the value of variable $a - \$ = "display the dolar sign". Other usefull are: \n (new line), \r (carriage return, used together with \n on Windows systems) \t (tabulate). Other way would be to use single quotes: echo 'hello, I\'m "also" a string. And this is not the value of $a!'; Chars in single quotes aren't parsed and are displayed "as-is". Only exception would be the single quote char itself, witch you would need to escape this time, as shown above.
No problem - sometimes the easiest mistakes are the hardest to spot :)
$_REQUEST["Denied"]
Wow thank you very much for this reply. Clears a lot up and is very informative! ahh i love reddit, thankyou thankyou
Just a note, the location header expects an absolute URI, so Location: http://your-site-here/stuff.php instead of Location: stuff.php (even though the wrong style will still work, stupid browsers!).
Awww, I wanted to see what I was up against... &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;: phpinfo() has been disabled for security reasons in &gt;&lt;b&gt;/render/4de48b018335e&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I couldn't make it easy for you :-)
I'll take a crack at it function truncate_html_text($html, $length, $encoding = 'UTF-8') { function tnrecurse(DOMNode $node, &amp;$length) { for($n = 0; $n &lt; $node-&gt;childNodes-&gt;length; $n++) { $cnode = $node-&gt;childNodes-&gt;item($n); if($cnode instanceof DOMText) { if(($cnlen = strlen($cnode-&gt;textContent)) &lt;= $length) $length -= $cnlen; else { $cnode-&gt;deleteData($length, $cnlen - $length); $length = 0; } } elseif($cnode-&gt;hasChildNodes()) tnrecurse($cnode, $length); } } $domdoc = new DOMDocument(1.0, $encoding); $domdoc-&gt;loadHTML('&lt;p&gt;' . $html . '&lt;/p&gt;'); // DOMDoc adds its own &lt;p&gt; if you don't $node = $domdoc-&gt;getElementsByTagName('p')-&gt;item(0); tnrecurse($node, $length); $html = $domdoc-&gt;saveXML($node); return mb_substr($html, 3, strlen($html) - 7, $encoding); // Removes the enclosing &lt;p&gt; } It might throw some exceptions or warnings if the HTML is malformed. Nothing that can't be handled gracefully though.
Try some suggestion may i can be helpful
Ahh, I did overlook the DoS origin argument. Heh, while everyone is firewalling *from* the internet, you'd have to put the internet itself behind a Firewall..
Or just follow the basics, don't change headers after outputting content.

These will stop any serious attacks. But bulletproofing ain't gonna be easy. There are still ways to read (and write) sources given that you know the location of the file you're looking for. You'd still need to block zip, xml, apc (maybe), apd (maybe), and I'm sure I'm still missing some vectors here. Another funny thing: even though you blocked "ini_set", there is "ini_alter". Yep, this is why we love PHP.
Well done! Looks like I've got some more tightening ahead of me :-) I can see how ZipArchive can be dangeous, but XML and it's related ones I'm curious about. APC seems safe, the worst you could do is push PHP to it's memory limit, which I have low enough to not OOM the host. APD I don't consider dangeous either. As for reading sources, the source is freely available on github (link when first visiting) so that's not a concern, and I have the OS permissions locked enough that you can't overwrite the actual site scripts via the system, so that should be safe. Also, I can't believe ini_alter doesn't trigger on the ini_set disable_function like so many other 'is an alias of' functions - christ PHP can be stupid sometimes!
Several things about this: 1. There's no way that I'm giving you my email because you want me to download your code. 2. There's no way that I'm giving you my FTP details to use an IDE, when I can do it on my own computer with no problem (and I have no idea whether or not you store these or not as you have no privacy policy). Even if you said that you didn't store them, I'd still feel dodgy doing it. 3. Your download is completely broken and doesn't work so I can't see the code. 4. You have provided open source, and then asked for certain restrictions such as "don't remove the update code". You don't really understand; once you open source it, it is no longer your property and you can't make demands on how people change your software.
I was able to craft a php code and inject it (via xml) into your render.php (a little help from chmod). This broke the backend, Terribly sorry. *to fix: add chmod, chown, chgrp to the disabled_functions* 
Excellent! That was an oversight on my end, those files were supposed to be root-owned and I changed them for testing but forgot to switch back :-) I've cleaned that up and it's back in working order again - keep breaking it :-D EDIT: For reference, you could have done your edit with file_put_contents()
A thing which really helped me understanding the separation of model- and view layer was when I needed to develop an application which was able to produce the output in various formats. Conveniently Matthew Weier O'Phinney posted an article on his website around that time covering this subject - I'm not able to locate the specific article right now but will see if I can find it later. Before this, I was, like you, under the impression that I couldn't pass my models directly to my views - which is actually exactly what you want. Instead my controllers got way too bloated because I did all sorts of crude maneuvres with my models to "prepare" them to be outputted in my view. Then, as I mentioned, I came in the situation where my application was too be able to output HTML, JSON and XML. The data (and the corresponding models) were the same, but the presentation was different - I just didn't quite realize it at that point. My first try at this became a spagetti-code-behemoth where I did some intricate handling of the requests to determine which output format was desired and routed the request to the correct controller (because of my bloated and completely wrong way of structuring my controllers I had 3 different controllers for practically the same task which "prepared" the models according to the output format). Luckily, I stepped away from the project for a while to gather my senses and read up on a bunch of stuff. It was quite obvious to me that I was doing something wrong. After reading Matthew's article, which I'll try to find for you, everything made sense. My models were presentation agnostic - they were the raw representation of my data. My controllers were also presentation agnostic and simply managed access control and the workflow of my models before handling them to my views. Now, in the view was where all the exciting stuff happened. I had put together a front controller plugin which determined the type of result which should be generated and made sure that the correct view was called. Zend Framework is already built for this kind of stuff and supports you naming the views according to their output format. For example, a list of users may be named: * users.phtml * users.json.phtml * users.xml.phtml And then you simply have your logic automagically make sure that the correct view is being used depending on the response format wanted. In your views, you accept your models and handle them according to the response format. In my case, my index.phtml would render a table with all my users which would then be inserted in the general site layout. If JSON was the response type, the layout (or 2-step view) would be disabled and the data would be rendered as a JSON object instead and outputted. The same goes for XML. The basics of this was to make sure that your application handled this. If anything than HTML was requested as the output format, simply disable the layout and everything else, set the right headers and spit out your model data in the correct format - Zend Framework already has excellent components for working with XML and JSON. When I finally got my head around this, it was trivial to build my application - and the structure of my code was much cleaner. Suddenly, I had absolutely no clutter in my controllers and my views suddenly contained stuff fit for the presentation layer :) The result of this was an appliation for which I could have a simple HTML interface while exposing my models as JSON for my rich ExtJS interface and support XML for some 3rd party tools I needed. This project changed the way I worked with MVC and ZF in general. **TL;DR: Yes, you absolutely can (and should) pass your models to the view layer. The controller nor the model is responsible for formatting your data - that's what your view is for. Try it out and see how much simpler you can make your models and controllers and discover the benefits from keeping a clean architecture.** EDIT: I found the article I was blabbering about: http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/233-Responding-to-Different-Content-Types-in-RESTful-ZF-Apps.html + some typos. Hope this is of some sort of help.
Could use [Lithium](http://lithify.me). It's not really simpler than cake and it's documentation is patchy at best but I'm going to evangelize it anyway cause there have been some moments where it's flexibility has made my jaw drop to the floor, and it's fun to use.
Kohana is amazing. I went from CakePHP to CodeIgniter to Kohana and never looked back. The company I work for uses a customized MVC based on Cake (called Kata) and I hate it with a passion.
Little bit trickier to do a PhpFiddler, and might not be as useful as JsFiddler is. 
Haha yep, swag. Ya, I think being able to install it locally would be awesome!
This has been sort of mentioned from some others, and I also agree there must be a better solution than doing this but you could just do something like this: class Test { public $var1 = "test"; public $var2; public $var3; public function cloneFromObject( $obj ){ $vars = get_class_vars( get_class( $obj ) ); foreach ($vars as $name =&gt; $value) { echo "Changing: " , $name , " to " , $obj-&gt;$name , "&lt;br/&gt;\n"; $this-&gt;$name = $obj-&gt;$name; } } } $obj1 = new Test(); $obj2 = new Test(); $obj2-&gt;var2 = "Clone me"; $obj1-&gt;cloneFromObject( $obj2 ); echo "&lt;pre&gt;"; var_dump($obj1); var_dump($obj2);
just on a side note, use echo "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;" , $post['Title'] , "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" , $post['Author'] ... rather than echo "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;" . $post['Title'] . "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" . $post['Author'] ... the first just treats those are separate parameters passed into the function (which it then prints one after another) whereas the second first creates a new string "object" for each concatenation (which is wasteful)
Dude seriously, stop wasting time trying to be fancy and just get the job done.
Nevermind, I found my answer, but I will leave it here in case anyone has the same problem in the future. You can use serialize and json_encode to append to memcached. My problem was I had already initialized the storage with an array, so the append was failing. Once I deleted the key from storage, things worked as expected. But, when you append to memcached, you must put some sort of separator that you can use explode() on, like a line break or a pipe. If you don't use explode() when you retrieve the data, then it will only return the first entry that you saved there. Example: $update_list = $mem-&gt;get('key'); if(!$update_list) { $mem-&gt;set('key', json_encode($update_array)."\n", 0); }else{ $bob = $mem-&gt;append('key', json_encode($update)."\n"); } $out = $mem-&gt;get('key'); $out_entries = explode("\n", $out); array_pop($out_entries); foreach($out_entries as $entry) { $bob = json_decode($entry); }
As you recognize, it is explicitly documented as only supporting strings: &gt; Memcached::append() appends the given value string to the value of an existing item. The reason that value is forced to be a string is that appending mixed types is not well-defined. You can obviously have a string representation of JSON data. [json_encode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php) returns a string. The output of json_encode is a string, and can be used with Memcached::append(). If append() is failing with a string returned from json_encode, then please share what error you are getting. Note that when you retrieve this data from memcached, you will get back a string with multiple json objects concatenated together. This may or may not be what you want, and you would probably need to split the string back into its original json components before being able to json_decode it. 
Yeah, I had an array value from previous testing in the store, which was why it would not append. I'm a bit of a dumbass there.
Name servers only point to an IP address, not to any file on the server. It sounds like she might be using some kind of URL forwarding at her registrar, in that case you'll need to login there and update the forwarding URL.
Nothing to do with Nameservers, however... Usually on a webhost index files will be passed in a certain order. Typically: index.php, index.html, index.htm If you have an index.php file this would always load first. Try removing/renaming and index.* apart from the one you want to load and see if that works.
Remember that memcached is only intended to be a cache of data that is already stored in a more permanent place. It's not supposed to store fresh data.
In the Apache configs, locate the ["DirectoryIndex" directive](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_dir.html). Mine looks like this: DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm Add index.php in there. If you don't have access to apache configurations, you can probably set it with htaccess, or through some sort of portal offered by your hosting company.
Exactly. tjdick, if you actually had a high traffic site that required something like this, you would quickly realize that memcached isn't up to the job and will FAIL on you often. If you really want to do something like this, use APC.
memcached doesn't address the same problem as APC.
Alternative PHP cache is not a database, and should not be used as such.
Might want to read up on APC.
And who said it should?
Can you show me where to read about APC's distributed store?
http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php
Er ... the original poster. &gt; What I am looking to do is to use memcached, or some other method if need be, to use as a store for pushing data. 
Problematically, this suffers several form of race condition on update contention; this is not in fact correct.
Yeah it's certainly not the route I would take.
My opinion - and I realize this is an unpopular opinion - is that generally speaking, binary cachers are evidence that the scripting language isn't getting the job done. Binary cachers only push the wall back a little bit. There's a time to switch to compiled tools.
Well yes perhaps binary would be more efficient in some situations, but generally the goal is to reduce the load on the database engine, which is typically the bottleneck. Also, I've seen situations where the system bus was literally out of bandwidth (crashing the server) but everything else was ok. I was able to solve this by using APC as well.
This sounds a lot like my library project from the UW. The instructor gave the requirements but didn't say what programming language. Everyone else used Java and objects stored in memory, I realized that a library system is better suited for the web. http://opencodeproject.com/library/ If you log in you'll have a fine due ($7.00). I don't think you can place a hold if you have a fine. If I recall, there were other requirements like tracking which is only available on books in the hold queue.
What kind of help are you guys expecting? I'd be willing to point in the right direction, but I will not be writing code for you. Just PM me.
&gt; but generally the goal is to reduce the load on the database engine That's a little like saying that the reason that someone put a plough on their compact car is to reduce load on the bumper. Yes, they're using one wrong tool to fix a problem with another wrong tool. &gt; the database engine, which is typically the bottleneck. In a well run system requiring caching, IO is virtually always the bottleneck, and the database is virtually never the bottleneck. &gt; Also, I've seen situations where the system bus was literally out of bandwidth I am currently unable to imagine a drive configuration which would saturate a modern bus. Can you be more detailed? Please remember that current busses can handle multiple FusionIO Octals.
Didn't posit whether this method would be suitable for production. Just trying to find a few different methods that might be useful for further testing. On SO, I read that concurrency is assured in memcached when using append, so I thought I'd play with it.
No mention of a distributed cache that I can see.
Wrong subreddit, dude.
The mysql and sql subreddit are so inactive though =( What subreddit would you suggest posting my question in?
&gt; On SO, I read that concurrency is assured in memcached when using append Whoever wrote that doesn't know what they're talking about (which is honestly quite common at stack overflow) That doesn't really change that this isn't what memcached is for, and that this won't go well as a result.
I would suggest IRC #mysql on freenode.
Hey, I have no idea if this would work (I was lazy and didn't feel like setting up the database.) if you could post the database query I can better debug my sql script. Anyways something like this should be a good start I'd think SELECT s.id s.student_name FROM students s INNER JOIN student_classes_completed scc ON scc.student_id = s.id INNER JOIN class_requirements cr ON cr.class_id = scc.class_id INNER JOIN classes c ON c.class_id = cr.class_id WHERE c.class_name = "CS-101" 
Does it really matter? It's a pretty generic question. So the apple ended up with the vegetables. At least it didn't end up in r/cplusplus
I don't undestand how r/cplusplus is less appropriate than r/php
We asked on #mysql, but they wouldn't help because they became incredulous to the idea of it not being a 'homework problem'.
apc_fetch(), apc_store(), apc_delete().
I'm not going to entertain that crap.
If you use PDO for your queries, you can get a result set with a single function call. From there, you have an array of results where you can do something like: foreach ($results as $key=&gt;$value) { echo "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;" . $value . "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"; } it really is similar to what you are doing but PDO is nice as it works just about the same regardless of the database to which you are connecting. It won't really solve your table layout issue but it may make your code cleaner as you progress. also, with your sessions, you MUST start them before any output. &lt;html&gt; is output even above the first &lt;?php tag. Any space or non-&lt;?php tag is considered output if it occurs outside of php tags. Hope this helps
That's just local storage. There's no way to do a distributed (memcache pool, for example) setup with APC.
Ok. Well if you think you can in Memcache that isn't correct, considering it crashes under load.
Helps a ton! Thank you!
You don't think PHP (with or without APC) blocks under load? Everything fails under enough load, one way or another. If this were not the case, I'd be serving the public Wikipedia site off my phone. Throw more servers at it. With memcached you'll need fewer since you can share the cache.
No problem, glad I could help!
So basically, if you make a claim that seems highly unlikely, and someone asks you politely to explain how it's possible, it's crap you won't entertain? Awesome.
What? We use memcached for sessions, 10 servers in the pool with over a million hits a day. It has *never* been a failure point for us. edit: And we're using it for a lot more than sessions, soon.
Not trying to be an ass but it's not really "sharing" the cache. Memcache pools start from the first one and move through the pooled servers sequentially until it can store the data. If one of your memcache servers goes down all of the data cached on it will disappear from the pool.
Here's a different direction you might explore. Haven't tested it though. select students.id as id, students.student_name as name from students join student_classes_completed on (students.id = student_classes_completed.student_id) where student_classes_completed.class_id in (select requires_class_id from class_requirements where class_id = 3);
When I got out of the military I took a PHP contract position for 12$/hour. That really sucked, but most employers can't ignore how cheap you are. After three months I jumped to 20$/hour, then 30$, and now ( 5 years later ) I've mostly moved beyond PHP into other languages where my rates vary from 65$/hour to 120$/hour. All I've got is 2 years of a CS degree, a couple associates, some extreme tenacity, and a habit of self-studying about 10-15 hours a week. Once you get into the groove of writing software professionally you should be able to handle most intermediate level work. Also I've worked with a senior Ruby developer who went from being a music teacher to 60$/hour in only two years, so I'm definitely not a fluke if you enjoy your job.
I do think this is the right direction, sub queries definitely seem to be necessary. But I don't think that query will do exactly what were looking for either (I haven't tested it yet). It would have to be something like "IN ALL". I think we are probably going to end up re-thinking the solution to our problem and use less MySQL and take a more PHP oriented approach. 
I'd need to play around a bit to make sure this works, but this should be an option if MySQL has a string aggregation function that will roll up rows to a list. I know I've been able to find custom functions for Oracle and SQL Server that do it. What I would do would be to join the student and student's classes table together to get a list of the classes the student completed, grouping by student's ID and name. I'd then do the same to the classes and class_requirements table, grouping by class_id and class_name. I'd then join these two queries together with a subquery, joining them where the two lists of a student's completed classes is equal to the list of the classes requirements. It would look something like this: SELECT s.id, s.student_name, to_list(scc.class_id) as completed_classes FROM students s JOIN student_classes_completed scc ON s.id=scc.student_id JOIN ( SELECT c.class_id, c.class_name, to_list(cr.requires_class_id) as required_classes FROM classes c JOIN class_requirements cr ON c.class_id=cr.class_id GROUP BY c.class_id, c.class_name ) requirements ON to_list(scc.student_id)=requirements.required_classes GROUP BY s.id, s.student_name You'd probably have to find a string aggregation function that will order the value within it. You should be able to find something online to do it and then you'll just build it as a custom or user-defined function in MySQL. You also don't need to the completed_classes portion in the initial select, but I would keep it in there just to see what's going on as I was building the two queries. I've never had to work much with MySQL, but know it has its limitations. Hopefully it'll allow something similar to what I've described as it should be what you're looking for. The query will be pretty slow though due to the function and subquery.
I agree with everything here. The stripslashes strip_tags underscores inconsistency and the inconsistency of $needle and $haystack make functions way harder to memorize. 
Seriously? Thats so unrelated
Step 1 is going to be a problem since XSS exploits can still creep in through certain attributes. Malformed HTML would be another problem. If you decide to proceed with this, I would suggest running an automated test that goes through the XSS cheat sheet and tries each string out on your filter code. XSS Cheat Sheet: http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html
Perhaps you'd like to borrow some code from Drupal? See [filter_xss()](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--common.inc/function/filter_xss) and the functions it calls, which are hyperlinked in the source listing.
+1 for writing to file and process in batch, preferably in one big transaction.
Thanks. Yeah, I already have a small version that writes to file, but didn't think of a good delivery system yet. I'm looking to write several versions of the code, then figure the best option for us. Speed is more important than accuracy. Dropping a couple rows here or there isn't really a big deal for this script. I will know the expected number of rows, so I'll know how many rows, if any, are lost.
[HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier) is probably your best bet. Failing that, it's better to use DOMDocument or PHPQuery instead of regexes.

Sorry. That's about the most ridiculous statement I've read in a very long time. Memcache is used by pretty much 100% of the high traffic php sites on the Internet. I personally run *many billions* of requests per month through a multi-machine memcache pool every month without a crash. 
This actually works really well for what I am trying to do. I like the suggestion of looping through the objects variables and assigning them based on name. PHP is insane to me. I come from strongly typed compiled languages and to be able to variably assign a variable name like "$$var" is absolutely nuts... The power that comes with a feature like that is immense.
Looping through the properties of the object is what I ended up doing. Thanks for the reply!
I use PHP a lot, just like you guys. Doesn't mean we have to love it.
Meh, to each their own. There's always more than one way to do things.
Memcached. Will. Crash. I think the best I've seen it do is around 3000RPC.
Sorry. You're **wrong**. There's no other way to put it. I have years of practical experience with memcached running in multiple very high traffic environments which contradicts everything you've said, not to mention all of the other developers I know who concur with me. (digg, facebook, etc.)
I will also agree with everyone else here in saying that you are wrong. I run dual memcached servers that take care of 1 million uniques/day, currently doing 750 cache req/second. Memcache has issues that Redis now addresses in a better fashion but stability is not one of them.
You guys can say I'm wrong all day long, but the fact of the matter is that it does fail, and I'm certainly not the only one to experience this issue. I can only hope when it fails on you, you are able to migrate quickly to a different solution.
At this point, I'm pretty sure that you don't even understand what memcached is given what you've compared it to.
This. HTMLPurifier is the only thing that can clean up untrusted HTML. It also has a ton of options, but even the default setting is almost guaranteed to be secure. None of the other filtering libraries even come close. It's pretty slow and hogs quite a bit of memory, though, so you'd better cache the filtered result as much as you can. Also, make sure you display the results in UTF-8. Not even HTMLPurifier can save you from XSS if you use the wrong character encoding. header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8'); 
Drupal uses kses, which is not a particularly elegant way to filter HTML. Kses can break your page layout if you scrape random web pages with it, and it's also possible to subvert kses using some CSS tricks in the style attribute. [Reference](http://blog.astrumfutura.com/2010/08/html-sanitisation-the-devils-in-the-details-and-the-vulnerabilities/)
That's wrong- memcache's append is atomic so there is no race condition. You should look into using add instead of set though. I do agree that this is not a really good use of memcache, though.
Which is why style attributes are removed. I'd still opt for HTMLpurifier though.
The 100% most secure way of doing this is to not actually allow HTML input, but your own custom tags (like Reddit, Stack Overflow and many others). Escape/htmlentities() the input, then convert your tags with some simple matching to the allowed HTML. This way you have **100% control** over the HTML in the output. HTMLPurifier is another method, but it's bulky and cumbersome to configure. If you are sure you need to accept HTML, this is undoubtedly the best bet though.
One should be aware that it is still possible to generate undesired HTML this way. Eg with src attributes set to a javascript scheme, or with attributes that run out of quotes.
It is great. Just don't forget to keep it up to date.
&gt; That's wrong- memcache's append is atomic so there is no race condition Atomicity doesn't fix almost any race conditions, sir. Talking points do not substitute for a legitimate technical understanding of the matter. All atomicity guarantees is that one isn't partially applied when the other is applied. That has nothing to do with what I was talking about. If Memcached has "abc" in cache, and you write "d", then during "d" you write "e", you are *not* defined to get "abcde". What Memcached's authors are saying is "you'll never get garbage," because it's just supposed to be a hot cache; they think "abce" has replaced "abcd." Indeed, atomicity has literally nothing to do with this: both the right and the wrong thing can be done atomically. You might as well point out what memcached's underlying datastructure it is. Memcached *does* *not* *guarantee* *the* *end* *result* *of* *that* *action*. This is one of the many, many reasons that reading cute little phrases like "it's atomic" and "it's webscale" aren't actually particularly interesting. It's not that this isn't a good use, though that's factual. It's that this isn't a correct use, and superficial flinging around of misunderstood platitudes won't change that.
lol, it would be pointless to use HTML without the style attribute. Even basic things like changing the font size/color requires styles, unless they have zero regard for web standards. Wait a second, kses doesn't even try to produce standards compliant HTML. How has this half-assed filtering library survived so long in popular packages like WordPress and Drupal?
Because it is used on UGC, who's authors are only allowed to use predefined styles.
While it's a bad idea, here is my attempt just for fun. For those who say write to a temp file on disk because memcache has race conditions, handing flock is much slower and error prone and will be more of a problem than memcache race conditions w/ atomic updates even given you may lose an update. My method uses a timestamp + uniqid on the apc key. I don't know if you can get a list of keys from memcache or not so I went with apc. Another idea is to make temp tables in ram using same batch key name then with a transaction, insert into perm select from temp method then drop the temp table. These can all be a problem if you use anything like auto increment or unique primary keys as you have to handle conflict resolution after the fact and didn't provide whatever created the data any feedback. my attempt: $m = new Memcached(); $m-&gt;addServer('localhost', 11211); // block batch_keys in 10 minute chunks function queueData($data, $batch_minutes = 10) { $batch_seconds = 60*$batch_minutes; $batch_key = sprintf("batch_%d_%s", (int) (time()/$batch_seconds) * $batch_seconds, uniqid() ); $data_encoded = base64_encode(serialize($data)); apc_add($batch_key, $data_encoded); } // process batch entries 20 minutes+ old function processBatch($process_minutes = 20) { $batch_seconds = 60*$batch_minutes; $process_seconds = 60*$process_minutes; if ( $cache_info = apc_cache_info('user') ) { if ( array_key_exists("cache_list", $cache_info) ) { $batch_update_file = tempnam("/tmp", "batch_update"); $fh = fopen($batch_update_file, "w"); foreach ( $cache_info{"cache_list"} as $cache_entry ) { if ( $cache_entry{"type"} == "user" ) { $matches = preg_split("/_/", $cache_entry{"info"}); if ($matches{1} &lt;= time() - $process_seconds) { $data = unserialize(base64_decode(apc_fetch($cache_entry{"info"}))); // print_r($data); fwrite($fh, sprintf("%s\t%s\t%s\n", $data{"time"}, $data{"uniqid"}, $data{"jibberjabber"}), 8192); apc_delete($cache_entry{"info"}); } } } fclose($fh); $query = "load data infile '$batch_update_file' replace into tablename"; print "run query: $query\n"; unlink($batch_update_file); } } } // add dummy data for testing $rand = rand(10,100); for($i=0; $i&lt;$rand; $i++) { $store = array("time"=&gt;time(), "uniqid"=&gt;uniqid(), "jibberjabber"=&gt;sha1(uniqid())); queueData($store); } // this would normally run in a cron job every 5 minutes or so processBatch(0); // process time 0 for testing instant data 
In case anyone wanted more background on the application, I am writing a small app that will continually check my google voice # for text messages. When new messages come in, it checks youtube for the search string returning the most relevant items (might expand to include grooveshark in the future). In "autopilot mode" it grabs the first most relevant youtube link, then dl's and encodes it into mp3. The part I need to figure out now is adding it to a currently active playlist. In DJ mode, the requests come in, the DJ sees the most relevant links and then chooses which one he thinks is most appropriate to add to the queue. The idea being that this is a crowd sourced DJ/Playlist for my wedding reception/party.
You will probably have to interface through Flash or JavaScript. For instance, [WMP is scriptable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/299582/is-there-a-documented-javascript-api-for-windows-media-player) given the correct environment. 
Check out the Soundcloud API
I have something sort of similar with an Android app that I wrote. Basically all of the songs on my PC at home are in a MySQL database (There's probably like 5k) that has all the album/artist/song information etc. and a file location. When I request a file from the list (I send it to the phone as a really simple CSV type of data format) it loads a PHP file from Apache on my home server with the Primary Key in the database. PHP then puts out a header of mp3 so the music player thinks its actually an MP3 and begins to stream it. It's really simple. You could do a similar thing - 1. Keep a table with all of the encoded songs (In case at a later time somebody requests a song you have already encoded) then keep two more tables. 1 - A playlist name / information table with stuff like date created or whatever you'd like. Then another table with associates each of the songs to that playlist 2. Just have the playlist / playlist song tables and encode them as needed. 3. Just keep one table with a list of current songs / where they are encoded and just continually add songs to it as one large 'master' playlist. If you're just trying to get this done and working you might want to go with 2 or 3 as an easy solution but if you really want to build this into a nice project having a nice normalized database scheme like 1 is probably the way to go. Do some research into mysql vs sqlite to see what would suit your needs better. As for basic communication / message passing look into JSON so you can send stuff like: $output = array( "command" =&gt; "add_playlist", "song" =&gt; $file_location, "name" =&gt; $file_name ); echo json_encode( $output ); Likewise `json_decode` in PHP will decode this after it's passed. jQuery works really well with JSON as well if you ever decide to create some kind of web interface. Hope that's helpful!

Might be over the top, but you might consider [SugarCRM with a timesheet module added on?](http://www.sugarcrm.com/forums/showthread.php?t=26732)
Or you could just use Subsonic.
Are you looking for something to track your own time, or other people's? For a my own time tracking I've been using [Toggl](www.toggl.com) lately. It's web-base but also has a desktop and smart-phone client. It's got a free and paid version ... the free version is all I've needed. Yeah, it's hosted, and very but that's one of the reasons I like it...
We'll have none of that logic around here, young man.
&lt;3
Over the top would be OrangeHRM.
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_group-concat May just be what we need!
OP: &gt;I've been searching for a self-hosted... You: &gt;Yeah, it's hosted... LOL! :)
Understood ... which is why I was asking him for his purpose (and mentioned that it was indeed hosted_. Perhaps his reasons for wanting to self-host are weak. This is an effective free option for someone to track their time without having to maintain the app.
I'm abrasive like a grinding wheel, baby. Deal with it. Grinding wheels are also useful.
That'll work. You'll just have to remember to use the ORDER BY within the function to make sure your JOIN to the subquery works properly.
Ahh yes I've heard of Toggl for individual but this is actually for a ~100 employee business. Thanks though :)
Thanks guys for all the help, looking up tsheet actually led me in the right direction. I think i'm going to be using 'TimeTrex' http://www.timetrex.com/ It seems to do everything I need it to. Thanks angusmcflurry for leading me there.
NP ... thought I'd throw it out there, since you didn't mention what you needed it for.
If you're looking to use your own SMTP server, you'll need to use something more robust than just mail(). I use [SwiftMailer](http://swiftmailer.org/) in my projects.
Thanks! I was looking for something just like this.
check out [SAM broadcaster](http://www.spacialaudio.com/?page=sam-broadcaster&amp;tab=tab-sam-broadcaster-overview). It might be a bit overkill but it plays mp3s from a MySQL queue, so you can just insert a row into the db to add songs.
JPLAYER if you don't mind it being a .SWF audio player... works in IPAD AND IPHONE though!
Thanks a lot! We actually did forget to add the ORDER BY for the concat function and were having a strange issue where the application was returning different results than when we used the same query in our sql manager. Turns out the PHP application was ordering the tables in a strange way causing the two lists to be different. Thanks again for all the help on this one!
I'd recommend using MPD and one of their HTTP clients: http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients
I remember a few years ago, at the office we played with SnackAmp, it's a music player that can be controlled over http, maybe you can take a look at it: [http://snackamp.sourceforge.net/](http://snackamp.sourceforge.net/)
you can always implement a flash audio player to playback the MP3. There are several that have built in APIs and you could probably communicate to it via javascript. I've done this before, no prior knowledge of flash is required to get it working, you download the swf and read the provided docs. alternatively, you can skip the HTTP part entirely, if the PHP script works, why not run it locally on the computer you'll be DJ'ing from, and utilize a mp3 player on that machine to play the songs that appear in a folder. You could even go as far as numbering the mp3 files so they are sorted properly when dropped in. This gives you choices between itunes all the way to foobar2000 to make the playback work.
you selfhost it in your company? or remote server? i wanted something like this, on a remote server but stop it becouse when the internet fails then i have no time card
The second option is the idea I was going with. The issue I am considering though is, of the local media players, which will allow me to dynamically update the playlist without having to stop start or refresh the media player.
Wow, this looks sharp. Definitely putting MPD at the top of my list.
Check this out: [A list of command line options for Foobar2000.](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Commandline_Guide) I think it may have what you're looking for. EDIT: forgot link.
No problem at all. Glad it worked out.
Hosted app with Google docs integration: http://beebole.com 
MPD is fantastic. Ampache is also worth a serious look.
I use [Kimai](http://www.kimai.org/). It's pretty decent, quick to use and continues running if you have a timer on and close your browser or get disconnected etc.
remote server, and yea that's an issue but they can be manually entered later.
My friend and I tried to write our own a few years ago. Friendly advice: make sure you have access to set/change the time on the server. We built ours on a hosted machine that was set 5minutes too fast and got no end of crap for it.
Not sure sensible use of SQL limit/page and a while loop counts as lazy evaluation
My thoughts too, cool article, but I had the impression this was going to be about *currying* or a *delay/force* type mechanism.
I work now in Codelobster PHP Edition. It's very comfortable and free PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript editor.

Oh, post and get variable goes in Controller. You get stuff from db via Model, Controller does stuff with it and "render" it to a view. Render, as in get the result from the model or whatever and do stuff then set it in a variable say "blah" for a view (let's call it view.php). You usually do something like render("view.php",$result). Then only view.php can access variable "blah" where as the other views such as view2.php cannot, unless you got a stupid framework. I think that's the gist of it. &gt;____&lt; 
&gt;&gt;Am I thinking too hard about this? yes &gt;&gt;Or should I go back to the books and learn some more before trying to apply for a job? Apply for the job, you need job experiences. More than anything you need some resume fodder job, ie shit paying job that is relevant to the field you want to get into cause you can't get good ones. You should also learn OOP and get skillz in job interviews. Sheesh. Job interviews are great, it'll answer all your fears. It'll tell you where you are and what you need to get those type of jobs. So get fuck out there. --- My boss and co worker aren't cs major, they are from humanities and biology discipline. You can learn it, OOP. Hell even with my CS degree I had to learn web development by myself. PHP Object-Oriented Solutions by David Power is a very good book if you want to learn OOP. If anything you can pirate it. I pirated mine and end up buying it cause it's that good. I don't think web development require that much skills, I think without a CS degree I probably would have done fine in this department. After learning OOP you should move to a MVC framework and learn jQuery (learn the very bare minimum of javascript and go straight to jQuery). Anyway, it took a while to figure out what I need to learn and what order. Php -&gt; OOP PHP -&gt; javascript(jquery) -&gt; MVC Of course I already know HTML and know a bit of CSS. Make sure you choose a good MVC, cake imo is gimp as hell and not even object oriented. Yii, Zend (too advance and gluey), Code Igniter, Kohana, or Lithium (cake from ground up I believe) is pretty good. Best bet is probably Code Igniter. I went from Zend, got lost, and went straight to Yii. What you have to remember though, is web development is such a fast moving industry, all these technologies are evolving, and all these nifty techs are coming and going, that you have to keep up with your learning. You cannot stop cause it'll run you over. Edit: I forgot about SQL and some system admin skillz. 
If you're not going to commercialize it yourself, why not let someone else?
1. What is the problem with supplying you email for downloading the source code? This was made for tracking downloads, and (maybe) send an email when there will be a really change in the application (like new version, or some major updates) 2. Yes, I know that there are many people who are afraid (and that's OK) to give their passwords on other sites. This is the main reason why I did this project open-source. 3. I am not familiar with this problem, that did not happen on all computers I was checking on. Anyway, for some reasons, it may happen. I will upload the project to some open-source hosting sites (like google, or github, ...) 4. Yes, I know that, but you forgot the first word in this sentence, which is "please". I think it's important staying up-to-date, this is the reason why I did the check. Anyway thank you for your comment. Gregory.
Interesting, I'd love to see some form of syntax highlighting though, something like this would be perfect for uploading small "snippets" on-the-go that one comes up with. You might also want to make it mobile friendly, my android phone is filled up with small php snippets &amp; text snippets that I created using different applications (due to me not having a simple notepad styled app). That's just me :) I'd also would love to have the snipits (if that's what you call them) better viewable/sortable. If I got dozen of snipits it quickly takes up the whole browser. How about having the latest snipit like you display them now and the rest with the title and links to that particular snipit? 
&gt; And we're using it for a lot more than sessions, soon. For picking up the ladies am I right? "Hey babe wanna come back to my data center and check out my memcache servers?"
I'd like short tags to be enabled by default. It removes clutter from the HTML templates. 
http://ajaxamp.com/ If you don't mind the weight of winamp. You can uninstall some of the default plugins to make it lighter. What are you using to interface with google voice btw? I'd love to add sms based features to some of my projects.
I can't remember if this is the same class I used or not, but there a few floating around. https://github.com/shnhrrsn/Google-Voice-PHP-API I'll share some snippets with you if you are interested. The project will be open sourced on github as soon as I am near completion as well.
&lt;?= was decoupled from short tags, so &lt;?= is now _always_ available as of PHP 5.4.
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
not my choice of systems either. But we have a legacy database at my company and we need to be able to pull info from it using php
PHP has MSSQL functions - http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mssql.php Do you have any other databases you can use? I've used MSSQL before and it's not fun with PHP. If you want some sample code I can probably dig some up.
my companies accounting software uses it, and we need to pull data from it in PHP hence this nightmare task
Can you even run MSSQL on a linux machine?
PHP &amp; MSSQL aren't entirely terrible if PHP's running on Windows and can use MS' [sqlsrv](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/php-driver.aspx) driver. Enough so that I'd consider moving PHP over to Windows if it were an option. Since MS provides them, there's no *nix version. Past that, I've had nothing but problems with PHP's internal mssql driver, and it's officially [dead](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.mssql.php) as of PHP 5.3+ , but [ODBC](http://www.php.net/odbc) should still work. It's quirky (char limits on table &amp; field names, etc) and may require some duct tape, but it should work. 
Don't need to if its on a remote box
the database is apparently hosted on a windows server haha, but our web servers are all linux/apache
I'll save you the trouble: http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/eh9k0/doctrine_one_to_many_relationship_problem/?sort=new
I started reading that but somewhere in the explanation some guy started bashing ORM's and I got lost. Who answered this correctly in this thread?
You install FreeTDS and use the mssql functions. Works fine, we do it all the time. Much better than falling back to ODBC, although that works too. edit: Also, if you're not familiar with MSSQL you might want to look into an ORM that will handle it for you. Of course if you're not familiar with the ORM that might not be any easier. In the past I've used Doctrine on projects that deal with both MSSQL and MySQL and the switch is seamless (unless, obviously, you're doing any raw queries).
PDO?
Not entirely sure, but I think PDO relies on the other drivers? Either way, it [looks](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-dblib.php) like it's on the way to the trash can as well.
I'm having to switch from mySQL to MSSQL for a project at work (Apparently MSSQL is less expensive???), and the general functions aren't too different (mysql_connect -&gt; mssql_connect), but the more specific and useful ones (i.e. mysql_num_rows) have to be hacked in.
At what point does giving giving potential insight to an attacker outweigh giving credit to the developers? Even a small amount of insight can be incredibly dangerous.
&gt; I've used MSSQL before and it's not fun FTFY
The SQL is also different. Not much, but enough to annoy you. Another thing is accessing, browsing and updating the database. I may have just looked the wrong places but I never found a tool as efficient as phpmyadmin or just command line mysql.
OpenOffice Base works, sort of, if you get the right driver. My work won't spring for the MSSQL Express GUI thingey (again, too expensive apparently), but Base will at least let me run sql from an editable textbox so I don't have to do it from a command window and will display data and table layouts.
I had to write some PHP code against MSSQL for a migration to a MySQL system. If I remember correctly, I had to force PHP 5.2.x and install Sybase to get it working.
Can't believe you're the only comment saying this. But yup, use FreeTDS if you're on Linux, I used it successfully a few months ago too. The Sybase driver should also work iirc.
CakePHP? http://book.cakephp.org/view/1075/DataSources
There's a configuration option to encrypt session data. 
I also recommend CI. Have a look at Phil Sturgeon's REST library to implement your API as it does a lot of heavy lifting for you and includes digest authentication. 
Post just to see if I can ever get this submission to actually show up in /r/php or /r/phphelp
Why is this being downvoted? It's perfectly true. Wtf is going on in this thread?
All of this is available on github
Oh, I know, I'm just illustrating the futility, since it's freely available elsewhere :-) if you can dig out something hidden, I'll be much more receptive
nevermind StoneCypher . he's a notorious troll around here, and yea he made a mess of that post. anyways, kudos for trying an ORM :) I know I recommended it to you the other day. but, I think you should be showing us your schema file. All of that BaseUser stuff gets generated from the schema .. there's a ton of code generation when using an ORM . Also, there should be a 'behavior' you can define called Nested Set. Lastly, you probably want to query on the child object eg findByParentId()
Hey. I went through a similar situation / project. MSSQL is not supported natively by php anymore, so FreeTDS is about the only choice you have if you really want to access from 'nux. ODBC sucks pretty bad so I won't even mention that option. The simplest way I found was to have a php instance on the machine that hosts mssql, and use [sqlsrv](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/php-driver.aspx). Now. This in itself gives you a half-decent api but the icing on the cake was when I discovered [Zend_Db](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html). This in conjunction with Zend_Table gives you a consistent db agnostic api that made synchronising MSSQL and MySQL *almost* a pleasure. It is very easy to transfer the data back to your linux box into MySQL , with a simple cli script using a remote user connection on MySql. Good-luck, ( You may need it! ) 
My main tip would be use a framework now. Don't wait to learn one.
Use a good PHP framework, and get the correct MSSQL drivers and it's a breeze. I worked for a company that used PHP + MSSQL exclusively, running over 30 large sites (high traffic loads &amp; including 200+ pages of content each, all completely database driven because every single thing was editable through the CMS we developed) and it ran on that platform perfectly. We used Stored Procedures exclusively too, because there was never a need to move to another database and it meant we didn't have to worry about the SQL syntax. Though, like I say, use a good framework (Yii, CodeIgnitier, Symfony etc) and the database abstraction layer will take care of the inconsistencies without you ever knowing what they are.
look up the slim framework. have fun.
I agree in part, but not completely. Nowadays, it's so easy to start PHP development with a good framework, you don't have to worry about how horrible the database layers were, or how much effort goes into stopping cross site attacks or how do you work with different databases in a similar manner, you lose touch with the core of the language. I think it's worth writing a framework *at least once* to get a feeling and understanding for how much work's involved. Then when you look at other frameworks, you gain a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that's already been done, and potentially, done better than you could do.
In all honesty, I'd start out with a framework and roll along with it. You'll learn plenty about the language along the way, while getting framework specific experience, which can good on a resume because you can leverage existing technologies which improves efficiency. If you're dead-set on rolling your own, at least pattern your homemade version on [MVC architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller). Most well-adopted web frameworks are of the Model-View-Controller type or variant, like Django's [Model-View-Template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names). The separation of roles provides many benefits to web applications, and you'll be starting on the right foot for when you want to move to an existing framework like CodeIgniter, CakePHP, symphony, etc. 
Slim looks like a good routing framework, but I think a more rounded framework would better suit OP's app.
"Web Content Editor" is not the path to becoming a designer/developer under most circumstances, especially if it's a large business.
Fair enough, but don't expect your content editing to count towards experience in webdev/design; there are plenty of people out there who can do basic HTML, in fact it's actually expected of content editors these days.
I've written two. One which used a "pages" folder which it loaded all php files into an array to be able to check "valid" pages and then load the page if it's valid (p=main for example) and then you could supply with an id for certain stuff (?p=post&amp;id=1 for example). Then I moved onto learning a basic MVC model, and I also for a few days learned C# MVC2 (I believe it was at least) and then I moved on to working with cakePHP which goes down real smooth atm.
$30,000 a year for an entry level position like that is about the norm as far as I'm concerned. You could probably get some freelance stuff in on the side as well if you are concerned about building up your portfolio. If you do decide to do some freelance stuff, just keep in mind that you are going to have to dedicate a lot of time to actually finding clients, and a lot of time to making good websites for little money. The upside is that you get a portfolio. Also, if you manage to make any highly useful scripts, those will look great on a resume. 
In my opinion it generally looks better when there's a live version. However, theres really nothing wrong with portfolio fluffing to get you started. I have certainly been guilty of it. You just dont get any references or money, or real experience. Eventually you will want some hands on experience. You dont really want to be learning by trial and error when you have to deal with a large client where thousands of dollars are on the line. If you are really desperate for some quick cash though, you could set up a "web design" website, and offer really cheap websites (~$500 or something) and then just buy templates and use those. I know its really dirty and it makes me cringe, but sometimes you gotta pay the bills. Usually you can go on craigslist and find people who only want a $500 website anyways. 
A lot of sites offer pre-made templates (http://themeforest.net/category/all - one that I have personally used) where you can buy the rights to use the template. Then you can set it up, add some content, and as far as the client is concerned they just received a great new website. This way even if you charge $300 for a website, you are still making good money since it shouldnt take more than a couple hours to set up. On the other hand, this can be deceitful, and you may have some angry customers if they ever see the template used elsewhere. Plus you can't really use it on a resume. 
Do it, quick and rough. Don't worry about how it looks. Then scrap it and do it again. Then do it again. Each time you'll learn from the last time. Each time think about how you can make the code better architected, clearer and easier. Expect that your first few attempts will be pretty bad. A few more quick tips: - To start with don't worry about graphic design, performance tuning, database abstraction or caching. - Yeah I'd avoid frameworks initially too if you really want to learn. - Name things really simple. eg, a page that edits a review, call it edit-review.php or review-edit.php. Make function names and variables obvious. - Try writing useful, reusable classes that your pages use. Split the PHP page into 2 halves. The first half does code stuff eg. process forms, setup default values, get stuff from a database. The second half is your HTML template and any output, where you output items amongst HTML. eg. &lt;?php // database connections etc include_once('setup.php'); // variables setup $page_title='Home'; // load things from database here // form processing etc goes here // ---------- page output starts here ------------- // HTML header that appears on every page include('header.php'); ?&gt; &lt;p&gt;HTML code goes here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;?php // HTML footer include('footer.php'); ?&gt;
Database queries, form processing and HTML all in the same file?
Go to http://sitepoint.com. Read everything (especially re: LAMP), type out the examples. If you're willing to invest say, 4 weeks, into self taught training of basic web technologies, I think you can do better than 30K, "web content editor" position.
Sanitizing your database inputs is for cowards. It's like using a condom on a one-night stand. Be a man and just inject that shit directly. This is the internet, you can trust people. And while your at it, passwords are meant to be stored in plaintext. People usually choose like 5 character passwords, so why would you hash that out to like 50 characters. It's just a waste of space. Speaking of wastes of space, you really should try to keep your database to one table. It's been scientifically proven that columns take up less space than a whole other table. Just make sure to include enough columns to handle all the different combinations of data you may expect. People will say "Normalize it!", but you don't want to be just another "normal" person do you? Was Mark Zuckerberg "normal" when he wrote Facebook? NO! And look at him now! If you need any more help, let me know. I don't mind not being paid and becoming a partner so I'll make more money once we're rolling in the millions in a month or two. /s
Nice try Sony.
For learning and testing this is quick, simple and easy. Each part is still separate and can be split into separate files easily. And as things get bigger, parts can be abstracted away. Good clean code and separation doesn't have to mean separate files.
*If* you choose to use a framework, I'd recommend [Code Igniter](http://codeigniter.com/tutorials/). Lot's of people like Cake/Zend/etc. but from the benchmarking many others have done, and my own testing, CI is the fastest. I don't find it to be any different in learning or coding results than Cake/Zend either. If you need very comprehensive database management, [Propel ORM](http://www.propelorm.org/) should have you covered. It's a bit tricky to start off with, but I've found that it's ability to reverse engineer databases is amazing if you have to do any conversion.
At minimum, use a micro-framework. Idiorm + Limonade is my favorite pair.
sorry @jesse_dev but I created the models with the generate-models-db command, so I didn't have the schemas. I'm creating it right now with the CLI tool and updating the post for you to check, maybe you know what I'm doing wrong here.
Your going to find it difficult to get help on Reddit with this type of question. First your missing a lot of key things people look for. One, Have you tried it yourself? If not please do. If so what did you get that you weren't expecting. Two, what does your database table look like? (Column names etc.) Just to help you out a little your query would look something like: &lt;?php $stmt = $mysqli-&gt;query('SELECT image, title, description FROM images'); $stmt-&gt;execute(); while($row = $stmt-&gt;execute()) { ?&gt; &lt;img src="&lt;?php echo $row['image'] ?&gt;" alt="&lt;?php echo $row['title'] ?&gt;" /&gt; &lt;?php } ?&gt; I hope this gets your started.
&gt; I think it's worth writing a framework at least once to get a feeling and understanding for how much work's involved. This is true, but it's also not strictly necessary. Getting up to speed with a good framework will result in more productive development sooner and likely more maintainable apps, which is good for his friend. Learning any language requires a Project which you wish to implement. Good ones don't always happen along; this seems like a particularly realistic project, so it perhaps shouldn't be squandered on writing something from scratch. 
I dropped out of college when I was 20, started work at a porn web site where I did a lot of HTML and CSS work (among other things...) a year later I quit and began doing freelance work, mainly small jobs from Craigslist. Three years later I'm working from home, doing what I love, and am a general boss. I have a similar skill set; HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL plus a fine arts and design background. The degree doesn't matter, if you think it does then simply lie about it, no one will ever check/care. Your experience and work is all that matters. So you need to build those up. I suggest volunteering. Find projects you like and offer to do work for them. See a website that looks like shit, redesign it and pitch it to them. Get involved with local non-profits and do design or web work. Though I've never done it, getting involved with open source projects is a great growing experience and would look good on a resume. Get on Craigslist and do some creative gigs. Also, walk around your neighborhood and talk to local business. Find out which ones need web sites, logos, design, advertising, etc. and offer to cut them a deal (because you are building your portfolio). Look for employment with small studios, start-ups, etc. Try and find a place where you are working under a designer/developer. This is the best way to learn. I basically picked up PHP and Unix simply by asking a LOT of questions to a developer I worked with. It takes a lot of luck to do well as a freelancer, but luck is simply how you deal with opportunity. Open every door, talk to everyone about what you do, get interested in other people's projects. I get all my work through word of moth. Also, even though you are just starting out, DO NOT UNDER VALUE YOURSELF. Don't work with cheap people, they will always let you down. Being able to do design, front end, and back end makes you a very valuable person, don't forget that. As for your portfolio and resume, don't follow the formula. Forget objectives and bull shit, keep is short and sweet. Your portfolio doesn't have to be crazy, just a few pictures. Because, again, no one really cares. People are looking at hundreds of portfolios and resumes, stand out by being succinct and putting only your best work forward. [Here is my resume with links to my portfolio, for your reference.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N9liBf7fTIeswk1vNpCHGnKfEXlX1-0wP-IofcSAhd0/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CPeH5vID)
do what this guy says. And don't worry if you did a shit job in the first try, refactor stuff untill you're comfortable with the app. Cake and CI are probably the more n00b friendly frameworks if you're gonna go that way.
This isn't remotely deceitful if you explain it up front, and can absolutely be used on a resume. Not if you are a designer, of course, but plenty of web development happens outside of the design phase. Taking a pre-made template, converting it for use with your CMS of choice, making some basic tweaks if needed, adding some initial content, setting up email/analytics, getting it properly hosted, etc. should take a day or two and is probably worth about 300-800 dollars (depending on market - could be a lot more, really). Having a quality design made specially for a client will double the cost of a project - at a bare minimum. For a lot of small businesses, pre-made templates make a ton of sense. There isn't any shame in using them, just don't try to pass it off as something you did.

Oh man why all the downvotes? No sense of humour.
Yeah, because starting out with bad habits just makes them easier to change in the long run...
Painful memories?
Gotcha, cheers for the tips.
Awesome, thanks for the tips guys. I think I will do it without a framework first, just to learn, then as it gets better, i'll switch over to a framework and learn the framework :)
Yep. This why I avoid PHP development at all costs. PHP is a magnet for shit programmers and developers. You'd never see someone advocating bad practice on a subreddit of many other scripting languages and then someone else downvoted for telling them not to get into bad habits.
Try to code with good habits (MVC, OOP, Prepared statements etc etc) from day one. "start as you mean to go on"
Plan things out ahead of time. Know what functions you want to implement, and figure out which functions depend on others. Draw out diagrams if you need to, in order to help yourself. This is something I never do, and I always hate myself for not doing it. Planning ahead tends to be a good thing...
Security, security, security, security, security. You probably learned PHP by reading and copying online tutorials, and you'll probably be reading and copying a lot more of them as you keep learning how to do more complicated things. Unfortunately, a lot of online tutorials and even real books contain code samples that can lead to nasty security problems when copied verbatim. The authors are often too preoccupied with demonstrating one specific concept that they overlook the implication of using that code in a wider context. Next thing you know, insecure code only meant for tutorials end up in production websites for the whole wide world to exploit. For example, any tutorial that contains `mysql_query()` should be taken with a gallon of salt. Somebody at Sony didn't follow this advice, and just yesterday, they lost a million customer records. Oh, and they didn't encrypt their passwords, either. It's possible to write the damn thing first and fix security problems later, but it's difficult to do this after the fact. _Security best practices should become a habit._ When you sit down to write an SQL query which includes user input, you should find yourself producing prepared statements without even thinking twice. The same applies to escaping output. Don't get in the habit of doing `&lt;?php echo $var; ?&gt;` while thinking "I'll escape that later." You'll probably forget to fix it. Instead, as soon as you start a new project, define a function `e($str)` that does `htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` or something similar. Then get in the habit of doing `&lt;?php e($var); ?&gt;` whenever you echo something. (You could also use htmlentities directly, but it's easier to get into a good habit if it doesn't involve 30 extra keystrokes each time.) Get in the habit of writing secure code, and you'll be already ahead of 90% of PHP developers. 
Gotcha, cheers :) I usually secure my code fairly well, I used to be in the more shady side of this stuff, but I never actually learnt enough PHP to do anything with. Still, I know how most of the code is exploited, so I should be fine with that :)
Wah - some people obviously have NO sense of humour. Funny way to give good advice, bud!
Sort of reiterating what has already been said. But my tip, regardless of the size of the webapp or whether or not you use a framework: try to do things following "best practice" guidelines so you get used to doing things smart instead of quick and dirty. Also, //comment and plan ahead what you want the app to do. GLHF, learn and get excited
That sounds rather odd, two simple echo statements, as in &lt;?php echo 'hello'; echo 'you'; ?&gt; or what?
Pretty much. They are in separate statements. One is: &lt;?php echo get_field('summary') ?&gt; It shows up in the source properly and will render after I refresh the page.
What does the return value of get_field('summary') produce?
Just a text entry. You can look at the page (it's pretty basic right now) http://demo.therecipefolder.com/recipe/macaroni-salad/ In Firefox it renders the first time every time. But in Chrome, the Summary and image aren't appearing when you first navigate to the page. I've tried in two different Chrome installations now.
Works for me, but - I did read about Chrome having trouble with output buffering. Does your wordpress conf use it in any way?
If you go to that page, click to the home page and then back to the recipe. Or click the link on the sidebar to navigate to the recipe. I am not using any buffering or anything that I am aware of.
Oh you're right, that's quite weird. I'm quite stomped, perhaps it's an CSS issue?
That's great, now you can use your "shady side" experience for good. Just keep in mind that PHP has a lot of weird and nonsensical features/bugs, so sometimes you might have to take extra caution. For example, `mysql_real_escape_string()` used to ignore character encoding changes made through `SET NAMES` queries. I don't know if it still does that, but it was a real WTF.
Yep, I just learnt about the MVC architecture, and I'm creating a mini framework to help me out. Fun!
Yeah, that is wierd ._. I need to learn prepared statements though, those are supposed to be a lot more secure.
Are you not missing a ; there? &lt;?php echo get_field('summary')**;** ?&gt; 
I added that, and I thought it fixed it but apparently it is still having the rendering problem. Rechecking code to see if I missed anything else. Fresh eyes always helps and it was late last night. Heh.
It seems to work fine for me. Remember that PHP is a server-side language, so Chrome has no idea that an echo statement even exists. If the echoed statement shows up in the source then I would think it has to be a problem with how Chrome is rendering the css.
n1c caught the rather innocuous problem with my post. Missing the semicolon from the first echo statement was causing problems with itself and the following echo statement which was returning the image URL. Chrome was a little more strict in it's interpretation, which seems why it was having problems and Firefox was going "Yeah, I know what you want." After multiple attempts and reloading and navigating to the page, it seems to be loading without issue now. I guess I should remember never to blame the software when it's more likely you should blame yourself.
I thought it was fixed for a second, after n1c caught the missing semicolon. But then it started happening again. Back to crawling through code. :) I took out all the CSS styles to try that too. It's quite perplexing.
There's no difference in adding the ; or not as long as you don't plan on putting any more code in there
Something of a n00b here, can you tell me why this is a bad thing?
This issue isn't in your PHP code, it's in the output that your page is generating. You probably have a broken tag somewhere, or a missing closing quote. Run the output through the w3c validator.
You don't need a semi-colon when the statement is immediately followed with a closing tag. The semi-colon is assumed by PHP. You should still do it for the sake of consistency, but that's not what is causing his rendering problem.
You're right, it didn't fix the problem. The constant page reloading and browsing to seemed fix but the problem cropped up. I found some CSS that was actually the culprit. I had written some styles using the :empty flag so if the user didn't add an image or summary the box would be hidden. When first navigating to the page the CSS was applied first so it was seeing the boxes as empty so it hid them. Maybe it was just the speed of the page rendering that the summary and image were not loaded yet, but for now I removed those rules and it appears to be working.
Chrome has absolutely nothing to do with PHP. If it's not rendering in Chrome, then whatever you're *echoing* isn't valid markup.
Yeah, it's quick, simple, easy and completely wrong and will lead to yet another terrible php programmer. What the OP wants to do is to ignore at least some of your advice in favour of starting as he means to go on. Ok fair enough, learning caching and certain more advanced topics such as database abstraction may be a step too far at this point in his development, but telling him to "Do it, quick and rough" is really bad advice. You should never do anything "quick and rough". Instead, try to think about what it is you're doing. Plan things. Draw and sketch diagrams that may help you to get an idea of what is needed (they don't need to be formal diagrams, but something that helps YOU make sense of what you are planning to do is all that is necessary). You should look into separating your design (read: html code that the end user ends up viewing) and your application logic and database calls. A modern and decent method of doing this is called MVC (Model, View, Controller). You would do well to learn what this pattern is and to start using it early on in your career. Trust me, php code suffers from so many amateur developers who just "Do it, quick and rough" and never learn how to organise and structure their code. I have spent the last 2 days at work trying to decipher some legacy code that I inherited - a single script too, but I'm still struggling to understand it, and this is precisely because the person who first wrote it just hacked it together without thinking or documenting a thing. Here are some good links to get you started: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/mvc-for-noobs/ http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/create-your-first-tiny-mvc-boilerplate-with-php/ Trust me, you don't want to be processing your form logic and doing database calls and stuff like that in the same file you use to present forms and html to your users. Yes, you'll be able to get it working quickly. but any attempt to build on this in the future will lead to maintence nightmares. Push yourself and treat this as an opportunity to learn how to do things well. MVC is where you should start. I would recommend perhaps trying some basic object oriented programming too, although it may be a bit much for you all at once. Definitely head towards object oriented programming though.
I'm a professional php developer myself, and I actually couldn't agree more with you. I actually do write pretty good code these days, but it's taken me a long time to get there, and even now I have to work with legacy systems that are just fucking horrible to deal with. Time and time and time again I come across php code that is horrible and amateur - just a complete unmaintainable mess. I am currently working on a legacy system with include files 7000+ lines long, with shitty 1997 style html tags hard coded in the middle of functions that make no sense, with no separation of logic and design anywhere, no data sanitization and no comments anywhere to be found. I have spent 2 days trying to debug one fucking file, and I'm still no wiser. It is perfectly possible to write decent php code, using best practises, MVC layouts, unit testing and decent object oriented design principles. Unfortunately, if you do this, most php devs will look down on you (that's one of the truly frightening things), because they think you're "not as good" as them, because I'll always take longer than one of those guys to get the first workable version of a system out. Thing is, once my system reaches version 1, I can always expand upon it and change things easily, and it's very rare that things break. Even when things do break, it's easy as anything to fix them because I follow the DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle pretty religiously. So even if I have a bug somewhere, I find the ONE PLACE in the system this bug lives, fix it, and then everything works just fine. The amount of times I've heard terrible developers (people who don't even use source control always raise an eyebrow) refer to php frameworks such as Zend and Cakephp as "mickey mouse" things to use is actually rather depressing. These frameworks are far from "Mickey Mouse" things to use, and actually these terrible developers could learn so much from them. So yeah, I'm a professional php developer who actually agrees with you. Having said that, I'd like to think if you were inheriting one of my systems, you'd get a massive shock - some php code that doesn't suck massive donkey balls.
always use var_dump to 'echo' test strings. it'll give you the datatype and the length, much easier to debug.
Great. That's all I need. I don't mind using standard &lt;?php ...?&gt; for other things. It's the simple &lt;?php echo $value;?&gt; I dislike.
Seriously? You don't think the ".php" extension would give away the underlying programming language? If you're already going to custom configure your server to use a different extension for security reasons I'm sure you would not *turn on* the PHP credit we've been talking about.
It actually was valid mark-up, and it was kind of related to Chrome, but not PHP. From the best I could tell, the CSS was rendering much faster than the database queries, so some CSS that I had that was using the :empty tag was being applied because when the browser interpreted it the data hadn't loaded into the element yet.
php and apache are in charge of executing the php code...not the browsers. you should post the code here for more help
Yii is faster imo. I think Code Igniter would be easier to pick up since it have a huge communities and books and stuff.
It usually helps if you already know a language (since the basic principles are essentially the same across languages), however the best resource is probably the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php) itself. It's quite extensive, so if you go through it sequentially, it should teach you everything you need to know. 
Learn the basic syntax. Do procedure PHP and move on to Object Oriented PHP. Then after that learn a MVC. This assume that you know CSS and HTML and you probably have to learn SQL along the way.
If I was a hiring manager, my biggest concern would that you seemed really unfocused with where you want your career to go. You start off talking about PHP/MySQL but then it sounds like you're getting into a Web Designer role. In my experience very few Programmers are good Designers and very Designers are good Programmers, no matter what they say. My advise would be to make a pick and decide where you want to go. I'd also suggest going back to college and getting a Computer Science or equivalent Design degree depending on your preference. While in school and in your spare time, I'd recommend devoting some serious time to self-study, especially with open-source projects or a side venture. I know others have said the opposite about degrees, but in this day and age, web development isn't just cranking out HTML pages in Dreamweaver and throwing them up on a server. You're likely going to have to work with Devs to mix in database queries, javascript code, know how to optimize for SEO, know how to calculate and capture web hits and conversion ratios, etc.
We use FreeTDS. It's a pain to setup, but completely hands-free after that, which is why I forget how to set it up again, which makes it a pain to setup. AAAAGGGHHH!!!
I'd amend this a little bit. First, understand what MVC means, then attempt to learn a language. My failing is that I learnt a language, and then tried to hack my terrible programming habits into some semblance of a usable structure. Structure design &gt; language syntax
Don't do it from scratch. Use a framework, or at least PEAR.
For me, I learn the Syntax first, then basic data structures, then object oriented stuff, then MVC. That's how I learn C++, PHP, and stuff. The reasoning is they're not going to know classes and stuff yet until they learn the syntax and get some experiences in that. But then again people learn differently.
The PHP manual is a reference, not a guide, for the most part. There is information on how to use certain aspects of the language, but I wouldn't say that it's feasible to learn to program from the PHP manual. I say this as a member of the doc team. It's not that the manual is poorly-written. It's just that it wasn't designed to be used as a replacement for "tutorials" or "Learn to program" books.
Also, people might forget to leave caps lock on. Remember to convert passwords to lowercase in the database and authorize with a strtolower() function from the $_REQUEST just like Wells Fargo. ಠ\_ಠ
I disagree. The PHP manual is a perfectly fine source to learn from. Assuming you read it sequentially, it goes through each step extensively, teaching you everything you need to know. It starts off by telling you a bit about the language, what it is, what it is used for etc. Then it continues on how to install and configure the environment, followed by teaching you the actual language. Then it discusses various security considerations, followed by PHP's features. The actual reference part doesn't start until you reach the "Function Reference" section. Up to that point, it functions perfectly as a guide. 
Just keep doing it until you get it right. Oh how dare I recommend that he practice....
Funny, with my apprentices I use a totally different approach that works much better.
Clearly, your method is foolproof, in that case.
Learn the basic syntax: the forloops, the ifs, the whiles, etc. Then, learn some Object Oriented Programming (you won't truly understand an MVC framework, unless you understand OOP). Then, move onto a MVC framework. I've been working with PHP for 6 years, and I still don't know shit (relatively speaking, of course). Every single day, I'm learning new tips and tricks, trying to learn what I'm doing wrong, etc. It's a process, but it's a good way to start. Also, Wordpress has a horrible thing with integrating PHP and HTML. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS. It will make your life so much easier, if you do. Try to keep the Wordpress way of doing things out of your mind while your learning. It'll just confuse you when you see neatly written code. Edit: Just keep at it. Don't worry if it doesn't work the first time out of the gate; errors and bugs are a great way of learning what you're doing wrong, and how to get out of those bad habits :). Good luck!
Out of curiosity what do you have in mind for a the web app?
&gt;Also, Wordpress has a horrible thing with integrating PHP and HTML. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS Mixing PHP and HTML is just fine, if done properly. See: [Savant](http://phpsavant.com/), [Zend_View](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.html) etc. As long as you do not mix business logic with the presentation, you should be alright. 
Retrospectively, as programmers, we can say "Yeah, all of the important stuff is there" in the manual. But, the problem isn't in learning how to use PHP, it's learning how to program. They're two very different tasks. In real life, non-programmers don't encounter anything substantial from the computer sciences, because they're not exposed to that sort of logic. Hell, a friend of mine is even learning PHP right now, already having had experience with Pawn, and he is having a hard time just understanding arrays in PHP's style. To reiterate, it's not that the PHP manual is poorly-written, or lacking in any substantial way. It's that the uninitiated cannot understand the content matter that the manual discusses, because they are just that: Uninitiated.
&gt;Retrospectively, as programmers, we can say "Yeah, all of the important stuff is there" in the manual. That's not where I am coming from.. &gt;But, the problem isn't in learning how to use PHP, it's learning how to program. They're two very different tasks. Did you see my original post, where I started off by saying this? &gt;It's that the uninitiated cannot understand the content matter that the manual discusses Did you even look at the thing I linked to? I didn't link to the reference pages, I linked to the manual in its entirety, which includes a guide. Seriously, take some time and look it through. Given how extensive the PHP manual is, chances are you haven't even seen it. 
&gt;That's not where I am coming from.. What I meant when saying that is that it's not so much the *content* of the manual that matters, in that we can see clearly that all of the stuff we use is represented in the manual. It's that the way that the manual "teaches" the language would work fine for someone who understands how "programming" works, but it wouldn't work for someone who, as is the case with the OP, hasn't touched code before. &gt;Did you see my original post, where I started off by saying this? Yes, I was rehashing what you said, in the context of what the OP said. (S)He's fiddled with Wordpress, but doesn't seem to have any code experience, so they're lacking the fundamentals. &gt;Did you even look at the thing I linked to? I didn't link to the reference pages, I linked to the manual in its entirety, which includes a guide. I saw what you linked to, and I know quite well how the manual lays the language out in a "guide" format. I should say again, I'm part of the PHP documentation team. I've seen the manual, and I've edited the manual. I don't mean that as an appeal to authority, but rather to say that I understand what is there, and I understand how people learn, and the manual is not, in my opinion, sufficient to teach someone the fundamentals of programming. We're probably saying the same thing in different terms, but I'll say it again: PHP can't teach you how to program. It can only teach you how to program in PHP.
Stock up on body spray and microwave pizza. Get a very comfortable chair. Get lots of headache medicine. Start smoking.
*sigh* &gt;It's that the way that the manual "teaches" the language would work fine for someone who understands how "programming" works, but it wouldn't work for someone who, as is the case with the OP, hasn't touched code before. Yes it would, because it covers the programming fundamentals as well. 
Are you downmodding each of my comments? Every time your reply appears, my previous one is downmodded. That's a bit... silly. &gt;Yes it would, because it covers the programming fundamentals as well. It may cover the programming fundamentals, but I'm *of the opinion* that it doesn't do it well enough that you could sit someone down in front of the manual with a PHP install and have them come away with an understanding of how to write PHP effectively.
&gt;Are you downmodding each of my comments? Every time your reply appears, my previous one is downmodded. That's a bit... silly. ..... Why the fuck are you accusing me of downvoting your posts? Edit: [Here you go, you big baby.](http://i.imgur.com/CzwDA.png) I'm not downvoting your posts, now stop whining over your karma. Maybe if you weren't acting like somewhat of a douche, then maybe you would've gotten upvotes. Edit \#2: Yes, you pissed me off.
Create a servlet that handles all of the requests and includes the necessary files. something like: switch( $_GET['page'] ){ case "login": include_once 'includes/myajaxlogin.php'; break; // more cases default: exit; } Also, then you can make it so only PHP has access to the files, so if they do grok the name, they can't access them anyway. (or put includes/ outside of the webroot).
Perfection is the enemy of completion. Get it done, get it working good enough, and be done with it. You will do it wrong, make all kinds of mistakes, but don't try to fix them all here. Learn your lessons and do it right (but not actually right, just better) on the next project. Just keep **completing** projects, one after another, and learn your lessons and apply them on the next project.
I wasn't accusing you. I was asking you. I'm not all that worried about karma, I was just wondering whether it was worth continuing the discussion, as such behaviour wouldn't reflect well on your ability to engage in rational discourse. Given that you've now called me a douche and a big baby, I think that judgement is valid, downmods or not. Prior to your last comment, I enjoyed our discussion. Have a nice day ;).
&gt;I don't know enough about security to know how worried I should be about this. Well, if it's just a simple matter of linking to the files, then a request could be forged. Every action on a site should be done with a POST request, since it is a non-idempotent method. Also, every form should have a hidden input field holding a checksum which is generated upon each request, and matched upon form submission to validate the action. See: [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery). &gt;When running scripts to submit comments, etc., I check to see if you're logged in first (by checking for a session variable or comparing a cookie against one stored with your username in a database) but I'm still concerned this is a security issue. A session stores the data in temporary files locally, on the server. The only thing that is stored on the client-side is a cookie containing a session ID (for connecting the stored data to that specific visitor). However, it is possible to steal the identity by performing a [session fixation](http://shiflett.org/articles/session-fixation) attack. &gt;salting+hashing passwords If you aren't already, you should be using [bcrypt](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/). &gt;but I don't know much about site-wide security. OWASP has a vast library of [various attacks, and methods to protect against them](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack). 
&gt;I installed several plugins and themes... No offense, but I don't understand why you felt the need to share that. This is only a matter of clicking a button with the words "Install" or "Activate" written on it. What does this have to do with programming? Good luck.
You forgot the whisky.
I think that was meant to give us some background on his/her situation?
You're right. I should've specified that all logic/non-display PHP should be kept separate. Thanks for the catch of that error!
Read a few programming tutorials. Code up a few pages for fun. Go look through some open source PHP projects just to see how other people program things: such as phpBB, mediaWiki, etc. If you want to do professional PHP stuff, you're going to need to know basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, javascript), and how to write SQL statements. 
lol, dont speak about the slim framework or get downvoted... wtf.
You didn't address OP's questions, you just spammed a micro-framework. What did you expect?
learn html, css and js first.
dont use php.
&gt; I am currently storing the includes for the site in a folder called /include. Now, you can't just go to that folder and get a listing of what files are in there, but if you know the name of a file you can view it in your browser. Don't put code under the document root! Put your code a level above the document root. The only code you should have inside the document root is a minimal front controller: no configuration, not even your templates (you do have seperate templates, right?). If you don't know about security issues such as these, you should be using a framework (and a proper one, not the Zend "Framework" set of libraries). The authors of a framework have had time and experience to think these things out: they'll give you the secure login and session handling tools you need. Why reinvent the wheel? Do you think your requirements are different to those of everyone else who needs a login system?
I think you need to be using 'foreignType' in place of 'type' eg Location: columns: ... ... relations: User: class: User local: user_id foreign: id foreignAlias: Locations foreignType: many type: one This is an example of a user having multiple locations. It seems like some table relationships are only defined at the child level. As long as you're generating your base classes from the schema, you should get most of what you're looking for.
It's all about experience and spending time with it.. The more time you spend with it, and thinking about it, the more you'll learn.. You'll need a php/apache/mysql stack. I recommend wampserver for windows or just install ubuntu.
Just to throw out there, a quick and easy tip for protecting against XSS (at least for any recent browser) is to set your session cookies to not be available to javascript.. check out the $httponly option for setcookie(). To protect against session hijacking, you can set session.cookie_secure = true in php.ini but that'll make sessions not work at all under http. 
Wow Thank you guys. As most you mentioned, I'm going to get on the basic syntax, learn the loops "for" etc... I read some stuff about the MVC, it seems like I need more knowledge. But I will get there. heheheeee. 
\[ - frontpage \] is the link you're looking for.
I think the OP explains it fairly well? Basically a text book reviewing app, I can link you to my brainstorm if you want :)
I'm curious to know why you don't like ZF and what you think is a proper framework. I've used Symfony, Kohana, ZF, and they all have similar strengths and weaknesses.
1. WAMP 2. NetBeans 3. A simple project
If you want to keep your files under the document root: As a matter of course, drop an empty index.html into every folder, so that none of the folders can be browsed. Then, drop a single line at the top of every file that conditionally calls the exit() function, depending on something you can test for that signifies the file isn't being called directly.
Do you have an idea of what you want to do? That seems to be the best way to get into a language. PHP is a decent learning language since it allows procedural and object oriented paradigms but you really need some focus. Start a site, grab some tutorials on the web and hack away (works with just about anything really).
I learned PHP programming by reading the PHP manual. Sure it might not be designed for it, but at least for me that's how I started my career.
1. Don't use die() for code related errors. Instead: `throw new Exception($errormessage)` The only time you should ever use die() is if you're writing shell scripts. 2. I see dbname being set in the constructor, but when do the address/user/password details get set? You'd be better off having the constructor call those, and having connect() set the dbname. 3. Your life might be a little bit easier if you rolled a singleton routine into this. static $stored_connection; static function Link() { if (!self::$stored_connection) { $d = new self(); $d-&gt;connect(); self::$stored_connection = $d; } return self::$stored_connection; } 4. Since someone else is going to say it anyway, take a look at using [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) instead of the old PHP4 mysql_ functions. It makes classes like this obsolete.
Do you have any good links to explain exception handling? I never really understood it. User, pw get set directly in the class, which is dumb. I meant to change it to use a config file. Singleton only allows once instance to be running, right? Oh, and cheers, I've been meaning to check out PDO :) 
[Here's the manual page on working with exceptions.](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php) Ideally, of course, an exception should never happen, but if there is a chance one will happen you can trap it with a `try...catch` block like so: try { //code that might throw an exception } catch (Exception e) { //code to handle the exception case } If you only want to catch a specific type of exception, you can put multiple catch statements for each type, replacing Exception with the exception class. If you want to make your own exception class, just do: class MyException extends Exception {} and use the class name in the throw statement instead of Exception. And yes, a singleton ensures that only one instance of the class exists at a time.
I see, Thanks for all the help, I'll redo this with PDO. Does PDO handle exceptions automatically, or would I need to do the try, catch thing again?
As I recall, by default PDO handles errors silently and just returns false if your query fails. But you can call a function on the database instance to make it throw exceptions on errors.
Please don't use mysql_ mysqli (where the i stands for *improved*) has been around for over 5 fucking years. Likewise PDO (which would be my recommendation).
Gotcha, cheers
I would use a database. I'd imagine you'd want a character (maybe user) table that will store your variables associated to that character. You'll need to load them at the beginning of each page request but that shouldn't be a problem as long as you set up a primary key on your table. Each action would go like this: 1. Load the character data 2. Execute the action 3. Update the character data in the DB 4. Show the results page/menu 
&gt; Your life might be a little bit easier if you rolled a singleton routine into this http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/flaw-brittle-global-state-singletons/
Glad to hear it solved itself :)
NetBeans is really key here because learning to use a debugger let's you "visualize" how your code is working by stepping through it. Here's a link to [how to setup debugging in NetBeans for PHP.](http://wiki.netbeans.org/HowToConfigureXDebug) and heres a link on [how to debug in NetBeans for PHP](http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/debugging.html). After you learn the basics and what an MVC framework is buy this book "PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice" by Matt Zandstra. 
Find an open source php project to submit bug fixes and feature enhancements after you've learned the basics. They'll usually give you feedback on how to improve your code, the use of coding standards, and you can bounce things off them on how to implement something. hang out (while you're browsing reddit leave your irc client open) in #php on irc.freenode.net and watch people answer questions. 
Don't use mysql_, use PDO.
TBH PDO doesn't throw exceptions by default, however I like to enable them, and then handle them in another part of the application. Essentially they're about mitigating circumstances - so if a query fails, what is your app going to do? Error out? Try a different database? etc.
I'm a bit concerned about your clean function, by default you're HTML encoding everything that gets inserted into the database. I would remove this, encoding should really be handled on the output, not the input, as the database is just the storage medium for holding the raw data. If you're worried about XSS then you can validate the data before inserting it using a separate function/class (such as strip_tags) but it doesn't belong within a database class.
connect() should return something other than true if it can't connect. I personally would have put the clean() method in a DBUtils class. You should also use static consts rather than numbers as flags. As others have said, die() is bad, especially on a trivial error like passing in the wrong value for type. Also, what's the purpose of this class? Why not use mysqli or ado_db? Are you trying to abstract the DB type or implementation? Then why are functions like fetch_array or fetch_assoc not implemented, forcing the users to break encapsulation and access your public members? IMHO, the only reason to create a generalized DB class of your own is to abstract your database details, e.g. so you could potentially have an easier time switching to postgres or mssql. 
Well, he could also add a boolean param that can be set when no encoding is needed.
The problem with that is that ajax is called directly by the browser. It would fail the check.
I actually generated the classes with generate-models-db ... how do you do it the other way? Also... do you mean I should place the Users table name as foreignAlias?
* **function connect()** with no parameters and requiring the use of $this-&gt;host and so on is cumbersome. Might as well have a separate function to set those values or include them as optional params in the __construct function * the **clean()** function is also kind of annoying, since "$type = 2" doesn't have any real significance beyond "it's not 0 or 1 or anything else". Use definition options like the curl options (CURLOPT_HEADER for example) * While I'm there, **mysql_real_escape string()** takes a **resource $link_identifier** as it's second (optional) parameter. If it's not provided, the fn uses the last created connection, so since you're storing the connection resource in the class, you should always pass the connection as the second parameter so the escape function doesn't have to guess what settings to use for escaping. * In addition, you don't have any clean options for numbers (integers specifically). Consider this query: "SELECT \* FROM classes WHERE id=X" Assuming that you clean() X, you could end up with "SELECT * FROM classes WHERE id=**1 OR 1=1** if the value in bold was passed. So for number queries you really need to have an intval() option (and make sure to quote even integer queries) * **function fetchObject()** puts all the results into a big array. I've seen problems where the resultset is too big for the allowed memory (even in reasonable cases) so you'll need some way to get a single row. That's all I got. It's not something I'd personally use at the moment, but you've got a good start.
Ah, right. Was late and not thinking. Those suggestions are intended to prevent direct file access. Preventing unauthorized access to the ajax is a little different. I see no problem with letting the user, who would normally hit them via the app, hit them directly. It's not like they can do anything that way that they can't. I would always check the user's credentials at the top of each function built to handle an Ajax call, though. Check the session for the user being logged in, having the appropriate permissions, and having the same IP address that the session was created under.
TIL. Have an upvote. 
Actually, I decided to try writing one as my first OOP thing, and I got used to it and changed it a bit. Then I've just hacked bits on really. I'm redoing it now based off everyones recommendations 
Thanks for all the tips, I'm rewriting it now based off everyones recommendations :)
You say you shouldn't use die, but throw an exception. Why is that? Note: I always appreciate advice when I see it - it makes anyone who reads it a better programmer, but more-often-than-not, there's no explanation behind the guidance.
First of all, I don't see why you're even doing this. You're just wrapping PDO, which is a waste of time. Had it been for the purpose of a [DBAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer), that would be understandable, but that's not what you're doing here. Secondly, what were you thinking when you did this? try{ if(!is_array($databaseInfo)){ throw new exception('Database Information is not an array'); } } catch (Exception $e){ print 'Error: ' . $e-&gt;getMessage(); } Looks like you've severely misunderstood the purpose of exceptions. Exceptions are used to notify the code further up in the stack of a fault that it cannot resolve itself. Your code catches the exception before it's ever able to reach the stack above it, and is therefore no better than: if(!is_array($databaseInfo)){ print 'Error: Database Information is not an array'; } It's completely useless for any forms of exception handling. 
I would change the numRows() function to: function numRows($table) { $this-&gt;prepare("SELECT count(*) FROM $table"); $return = $this-&gt;execute()-&gt;fetch(); return $return['count(*)']; } or something like that.
die() is terminal, script execution ends immediately and you cannot work around it. The user gets an incomplete document followed by this message on their screen that means nothing to them, and you have absolutely no record of the error. Because most users tend to be silent, this may continue for weeks without anyone noticing, and even then you have no information to help you debug the cause. An exception, however, can be trapped, either at the function level using a try...catch block, or at the script level via [set_exception_handler](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.set-exception-handler.php)(). Execution continues, leaving you the opportunity to: 1. Determine if the error is critical enough to stop execution (it may not be, some code libraries use exceptions without discretion). 2. Log the error, either manually or automatically using [error_log](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.error-log.php) 3. Dispatch a notification to someone in charge of the server, informing them of the error 4. If necessary, display a user friendly message to the visitor indicating that an error occurred and it is being looked into. Think about all the times reddit displays the "You broke Reddit" message. Now imagine that instead of that message, you got some random error string and nothing else, or worse, a blank page. Finally, if user presentation isn't a concern, here's the biggest reason to want to use exceptions: die() just tells you that an error occurred, not where it occurred. An exception comes with a stack-trace of the functions leading up to the error. This includes file names, line names and function names. This makes debugging SIGNIFICANTLY easier.
Well done on doing PDO, but didn't you notice how wrapping it was mostly pointless? You may as well go further up the chain and implement some sort of ORM with a standard (CRUD?) interface. You shouldn't be outputting SQL errors, also. Exceptions are there so you can handle the error somewhere else in the code (if my query fails for some reason, I'll do action X instead of continuing merrily on my way).
Or could just do $sth-&gt;rowCount().
Here's a [link](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/yaml-schema-files/en) . I recommend trying the detect_relations option. Also, if you're using MyIsam, I'd look into switching to InnoDb . I'm starting another Doctrine project this week, so I'll be right behind ya ;) 
I'm familiar with the supposed down-sides of singletons. Thats why I said it "might" make his life easier. At the level of development that OP is doing, brittle global state is likely to be a concern.
As the person who suggested he use exceptions, my face is in my palm right now.
dat(abase cl)ass!
If it's just a few options, it's perfectly OK to do if ($dead) { // click here to respawn! else { // fight // travel // etc. } But this can easily get confusing if you keep adding features, because you have to remember which options are available in which conditions, and you have to do this in the already cluttered template file. Imagine that you start adding options that are only available in a certain combination of conditions (e.g. health &gt; 50 and has_weapon X and distance_to_enemy &lt; 5 and blah blah blah) and it gets very bad. If you aren't already doing object-oriented programming, start doing it right now. (If you're already doing it, great!) Then you can have a "Character" class with a bunch of properties and methods: class Character { protected $health = 100; protected $is_alive = true; public function adjustHealth($diff) { $this-&gt;health = $this-&gt;health + $diff; if ($this-&gt;health &lt;= 0) $this-&gt;is_alive = false; } public function canFight() { if ($this-&gt;is_alive) return true; return false; } public function canTravel() { if ($this-&gt;is_alive) return true; return false; } } Every time a character's health changes, you call `$character-&gt;adjustHealth(-10);` or something like that. The class and its methods should encapsulate all of the implications of that change, such as dying and becoming unable to fight. Then, in your menu template, you can do: &lt;?php if ($character-&gt;canFight()): ?&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- Fight Option --&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endif; ?&gt; &lt;?php if ($character-&gt;canTravel()): ?&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- Travel Option --&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endif; ?&gt; which is a lot easier to maintain as you keep adding features to your little game. For example, if you decide in the future that characters with a very low health should be paralyzed and no longer able to travel even if they're alive, you can simply change the `canTravel()` method, and the rest of your game will work exactly as intended. 
ok thanks for that. I'm using InnoDb too. I don't think I could do half the things I want to do with MyIsam. Let me know if you find out anything interesting about how to handle Doctrine with ZF ;)
[Cargo cult programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) at its finest.
Gotta do it the write way...
If you're trying to do OOP, I recommend not having public member variables at all, and instead using getter/setters.
No reason to select all the columns to count the rows: &gt; $this-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM $table"); Should be &gt; $this-&gt;prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $table");
Well... as a useful class, what everyone says: i.e. it's a crap-tacular class. As an exercise in OOP, it's not that bad. What's your reasoning for returning $this on connect() and disconnect()? I'm assuming you're going for something like this: $db = new Database(); $db-&gt;connect()-&gt;prepare("select * blah blah")-&gt;execute(); If your connect method fails wouldn't it make sense to somehow notify the chain that you've encountered some kind of error? This would be where throwing exceptions would come in handy. My advise would be to read up on some open source projects and see how they implement their PHP classes. That might give you a good idea of what things to do.
Yes, Getting into Webdesign or Web Development is a good Idea!!! There is lots of Money to be made using the Internet. Especially in Php Scripts and Php Codes. After a few years on the internet i tried everything from porn websites, social networking websites, video and blog websites, affiliate related websites and i thought to myself wow this will never work, Until one day i discovered my love with Selling Php Scripts. I now sell about 20 - 30 Php Scripts Everyday on places like Eymore.com, Payloadz.com and my own Personal Website Resellcode.com and i am now a Happy Camper Again... Good luck on your Journey, Find what makes you money and Happy at the same time, there are lots of different Niches our there to try but using something that interest you will take you much further and keep you motivated to work on it much harder and longer!!! Ohhh and Remember Major Failure in the beginning can really help lead to success, it usually takes knowing and understanding why something has failed before it can become successful so if it doesn't work for you at first Keep trying... It took me 3 1/2 years to make my first $1 from my own website which wasn't on ebay LOL but now i finally make money sleeping and can stay away from ebay and there outrageous selling fees :)
Wow, some of the comments here are pretty harsh.
You probably want to take a look at the function [array_diff](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-diff.php). $good_mins = array_diff($array_with_mins,range(0,60)); This uses the === operator, so you might want to cast all the existing minutes to integers first.
I like harsh criticism. It lets me know that I'm obviously not on the right track, whereas someone more polite might lead me to believe that what I'm doing is actually decent.
Thank you! I will check it out and let you know how it works.
Okay, but not everybody is like you.
Nope, I agree with him. The harsher the better, either way it'll help me improve.
I'm confused, So do I, or do I not use exceptions?
Also, from what I've read, it shouldn't be too hard to turn this into a DBAL, correct? I think it'd just involve changing the dsn?
Oh, I see. That makes much more sense then. Any idea what I would be doing rather than simply outputting the error?
Also, could you maybe explain ORM? I don't really get it :/
And why would you do that? PDO already does it for you, rendering your class completely useless. 
You should use exceptions, but you're using them incorrectly. As said, you should use exceptions to notify the code further up in the stack of a situation that the class cannot resolve on its own. However, by catching the exception in the same class that spawns it, you're rendering it completely useless because it won't ever bubble up the stack. 
Actually, my main reason for doing this was to learn PDO. Also, I'd gotten used to using my last class, so I didn't really want to get in the habit of something else. Oh, and does PDO allow chaining methods?
Oh, and I prefer typing something like -&gt;connect() rather than: $dsn = "mysql:host=$this-&gt;host;port=$this-&gt;port;dbname=$this-&gt;databaseName"; $this-&gt;connection = new PDO($dsn, $this-&gt;username, $this-&gt;password);
&gt;Actually, my main reason for doing this was to learn PDO. So use PDO. Your class isn't really adding anything. &gt;Also, I'd gotten used to using my last class, so I didn't really want to get in the habit of something else. That's a bad reason to keep doing something. If it is a bad habit, you should stop doing it. &gt;Oh, and does PDO allow chaining methods? Why should it? Nothing else in PHP is chainable, why should this be an exception? Furthermore, it's not like it needs to be chainable, since you usually won't execute commands sequentially. Have a look: $pdo = new PDO($dsn); $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username and password = :password"); //this returns an object, so you could call execute directly on that, however that wouldn't make sense if you're executing multiple commands or fetching data, since you need a reference to the object in order to do that. $stmt-&gt;execute(array( 'username' =&gt; $username, 'password' =&gt; $password )); $user = $stmt-&gt;fetch();
there is an issue with the bind method that prevents this from running in Opera. i suppressed the error and everything seemed to work.
whatever. the guy is obviously new, he's trying shit out, and he's following suggestions. it was improperly applied here but at least he's posting it instead of selling it to someone.
Not might, if you are using mysql functions you have to. Try: array_udiff(range(0,60), $array_with_mins, create_function('$a, $b', 'return $a - $b;')); Which will convert to integer for you. Or, in the same code that creates the $array_with_mins make sure to call intval() on each value before placing it in the array.
Note that he got the order reversed, you need the range first and the list of mins second.
&gt; In my experience very few Programmers are good Designers and very Designers are good Programmers, no matter what they say. There are a few out there. The really talented ones command huge salaries, and are worth it. But you're right -- people who's minds work well in both fields are exceedingly rare.
Honestly, this is the best attitude to have. I've learned more from people who were rightfully annoyed to be wasting their time explaining otherwise simple concepts to me than any empathetic professor. The hard part for me was to stop taking things personally. 
Yeah, they're commenting on your code, not you as a person. Once you understand that, it's all smooth sailing :)
