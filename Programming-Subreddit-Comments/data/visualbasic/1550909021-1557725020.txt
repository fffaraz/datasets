You'll need to maintain a reference to it, most likely in a collection. Alternatively, you'll have to trawl through Form.Controls and search for the item you want, most likely through its .name property.
Interesting. So if I understand correctly I need to do first creat a collection of names I intend to use, then create the item and assign it a name from the aforementioned collection and I can refer to it.
That's an option, definitely. If that's what you want to do, I'll recommend using a Dictionary(Of String, Control) and then accessing the control through the control's name that is stored in the dictionary's keys.
I've never used the dictionary in that way. I've done (key,value) where it's string and integer. Could you give me an example of using control?
If it's a child in a form you can just do a me.controls("Combobox1")
You'd just define your dictionary as string, control instead of int, strong In this case your key is just a way to identify it and you "value" is actually a control object
 Dim ControlDict as New Dictionary(Of String, Control) Dim ComboBox as New Combobox With ComboBox ... .Name = "NameBox" End With Me.Controls.Add(ComboBox) ControlDict.Add("NameBox", ComboBox) 
Hmmm, directory/url shortcut list. 
no. what are you actually trying to do? 
I'm experimenting around with custom classes. I understand the very basics of it. (On my phone so bear with me with the code) I have a button generate an instance of my custom class, this class just has a .name property on it right now. I'd like another button to make a message box pop up telling me the name. Problem is, I don't want to create the instance of the class prior to runtime. So my class variable is only accessable in the sub that creates it

Public xxx as string = nothing
 Dim CustomClass as New Class Private Property Name as String Public Shared Function Generate(name as string) as CustomClass Dim CC as New CustomClass CC.Name = name Msgbox(CC.name) Return CC End Function End Class
Close, perhaps I wasn't describing it will enough. Create instance in one function Report class in another function, not the one it's created in
You'll have to expose the Name property publicly then.
The usercount has the value of 11 and there are 11 lines in the csv file.
Ok cool! The error lies in the fact that you start counting at 0 and go to 11. Which means you're counting a total of 12, resulting in a null in the last round. You can fix this by setting the for loop to usercount-1 Hope this helps :)
Thanks man, much appreciated 
Happy to help. Keep at it, we've all had these hurdles at least once in our career ;)
I’m going to university for computing science or hopefully software engineering
Yeah could try something like that, although I am pretty much brand new. Did hello world in class 2 weeks ago so yeah.
Share with us what you tried
Invalid Cast Exception means that you're trying to convert to a value type (string) to an invalid type (double). This is because your array stores both integers and string. You'll want to explicitly declare your data types, and store them in two different arrays. Dim TFS as String() TFS(0) = "Single" ... Dim TFSA as Integer() TFSA(0) = 12000 ... 
Put all the code you want validated inside the try block then in the catch block you want to catch the error then output it via a message box for example. 
Try/catch blocks are supposed to catch program errors that would otherwise stop your program from running. For example `Try` `Dim i as integer` `i = "ABC"` `Catch` `show the user an error message instead of crashing out to the desktop` `End Try` Without the try/catch that would show the user an error and then end your program. The catch part catches the system error and allows you to deal with it gracefully and then continue.
I tried: Try CarbInteger = Integer.Parse(CarbTextBox.Text) Catch CarbException As Format Exception MessageBox.Show(“entry must be numeric” End try 
Thank you, if I’m trying to catch the error of leaving a text box blank how would I write that? I put my example code in the replies, but when I run the program and try it out it just crashes. 
How are you applying the formatting restriction to the text box or variable?
I’m not sure. Im trying to apply the formatting restriction to the text box. I thought by saying “CarbInteger = Integer.Parse(CarbTextBox.Text)” it would restrict the textbox to only allow numbers to be put into it, and not to let it be blank? 
Its not restricting the text box, its restricting CarbInteger to being an integer. Are you doing something like Dim carbInteger as Integer = Integer.Parse(CarbTextBox.Text) You can still put "ABC" in the box, but it just wont be converted to an integer. You're getting the Formatting Eception I assume, yes? On the text box text changed event try adding in something like If isNumeric(CarbTextBox.Text) Then 'nothing' Else CarbTextBox.Text.clear MessageBox.Show("Value Must be Numeric") end if &amp;#x200B;
thanks, I will try that! This may be dumb, but do I need to add a messagebox to my form? Or will it just show by coding “messagebox.show(“”)” 
It will, it will just be a blank message box
You can interate the forms collection. This is off the top of my head so it may not work if you copy paste. I bleieve it will also work in vb6 if you remove the "me." qualifier before the forms collection. dim tForm as Form for each tForm in me.Forms tform.left=0 tform.top=0 next
Could you do a replace all (ctrl+h) in Visual Studio? For example, search and replace "FormBorderStyle.Sizable" and with "FormBorderStyle.FixedSingle".
that doesn't really help clarify, other that you maybe are confusing the difference between an instance and a definition. a class definition can only be set at design time. a class instance you can make at any time with any scope you like, and as many independent copies as you like. But that code to make the instance has to be set at design time too. if you want the class instance to be accessible in multiple button event functions then that instance has to be in a scope that's accessible to both functions. if they are on the same form, then a form level would work, if not, they need to be in a another class as public. the variable you define to hold an instance doesn't have to create the instance. just `Dim myClass as CustomClass`, no "New", will make a placholder that you can assign a new instance to later. 
Just so I'm clear, you're trying to add a dropdown with the options, and determine what to do based on what they select right? If so, try something like this. Note I'm also assuming by combobox1 you're using telerik combo boxes? if not the combo box .add line could change Dim TFS As New Dictionary(Of Integer, String) TFS.Add(0, "Single") TFS.Add(1, "Married Filing Jointly") TFS.Add(2, "Head of Household") For Each kvp As KeyValuePair(Of Integer, String) In TFS ComboBox1.Items.Add(New RadComboBoxItem(kvp.Value, kvp.Key)) Next 'then when you're doing code Dim selectedItem = TFS.FirstOrDefault(Function(t) t.Key = ComboBox1.SelectedValue) If (selectedItem.Value Is Nothing) Then 'you couldn't find what they picked, error here End If If (selectedItem.Value = 0) Then 'they picked single ElseIf (selectedItem.Value = 1) Then 'they picked married jointly 'continue on etc. End If
Here is the whole of my code. Maybe that will better explain the trouble: Public Class Form1 Class entry Property name As String Property count As Integer End Class Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim item1 As New entry With item1 .name = "First Item" .count = 10 End With End Sub Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click MessageBox.Show(item1.name) End Sub End Class The error is on button 2. It is saying that item1 is not declared or it is otherwise inaccessible do to its protection level. &amp;#x200B; How does one go about creating an instance of a class in one sub, and then access it in another sub.
yeah, you have a scope issue. when you Dim in a Sub, it only exists in that sub, when the instance goes away when the sub is done running. put `Dim item1 As entry` in the form level code, which defines it but does not make an instance. then do `Set item1 = New entry` which stores a new instance in the already defined variable, where you have the Dim now. if you don't want to overwrite it every time, you can test to see if it `= Nothing`, which will be true if there's no active instance.
I must have some flaw in my understanding of class instantiation. When creating a new instance of a class, in this case item1; if I over write it the old instance is gone right? How would I go about creating an unknown number of unique persistent instances? &amp;#x200B; Public Class Form1 Dim item1 As entry Class entry Property name As String Property count As Integer End Class Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click With item1 .name = TextBox1.Text .count = TextBox2.Text End With End Sub Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click MessageBox.Show(item1.name) End Sub End Class This works, but now if I hit the button once, I get 1 entry, but if I was to do it again, the previous one is erased and replaced,changed. How can I add more instances of a class without adding new form level blanks?
Do they go away if you Build|Clean? Have you tried closing and reopening VS? Have you tried restarting your PC? 
make an array, List, or some other type of collection of them. in C# I use List most often.
Would I need to loop through it every time i needed to access one of the members? 
not if you use Linq queries. all my .net is with C# though. only the very basics of my VB apply here.
Go back to your course manual man, we are not going to do this for you. This is basic code and if you cant figure it out at this level I would talk to your teacher.
/u/Bonejob is right, if you get stuck with the exercise try posting again with your code and we can try to help. &amp;#x200B; The exercise is written very well, literally code it top to bottom and you will get it.
Step 0: Create an input field and a button Step 1: create a variable (name it max) and assign it a value of zero Step 2: Write a loop that calculates the area when the length is 1, then 2, then 3 and so on. Step 3: Every time you calculate a new area in the loop, compare that area to max. If the area is greater than max, then change max to this new value. Step 4: Display max in the bottom label after the loop is over.
Close all of VS and re open. If that doesn't work, restart. Either VS, or some other process has a lock on that folder. It's most likely VS though. 
So, as a newcomer, the act of learning is a worthwhile reason to write this. But you should also ask yourself, what does putting these apps in your app do better than say, launching notepad.exe and calc.exe in Windows? What's your goal here? Is this going to add a function or feature you can't find elsewhere? Can it save you time in some way? This is the thinking that will direct what you add and what you improve.
Find a yourappname.svhost.exe in the process it was not ended when you had ran the codes last time or restarting helps
AFAIK, you can't create a new variable at run time. Since the exe is already compiled what you might be interested is creating a list/array/dictionary where you can store and instance of your class
I had the exact same problem a few night ago. Tried to tinker for a bit but then decided to just reboot and it went away. I think this is referred to as a stuck file handle. 
Yeah good point, it's just a little project I'm doing to practice my skills though, we have to do a project soon which will use these skills. But I will have to think about all of this for the project though.
Got a picture of the code? 
Needs way more information.. Is this a text box that you can type "1+5" into? or is this a traditional button calculator etccc
I reposted it, I'm new to reddit.
No worries, it would be helpful to see the user interface as well.

You want to use Strings as Doubles. You have to convert them for the use with Convert.ToDecimal() 
Thank you for your help! 
I appreciate it very much! Thank you
If double.tryparse(textbox1.text, dblVar1) and double.tryparse(textbox2.text, dblVar2) then 'code to execute when both text boxes contain numbers (the dblVars will be set equal to the text box values due to tryparse) Else 'code to execute because one or both of the text box values were not doubles End if
Also you can use try catch statements. Try 'insert code here that could fail (maybe due to a type mismatch or some other reason) Catch (ex as exception) 'code if the try fails End try
CInt(txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 1)) - 5
Not working &gt;.&lt;
what is your error? &amp;#x200B;
Since my programs in french ill try my best to translate lol.. so the first error is "this expression isnt a method" and the second error is "end of instruction expected"
Dim a As String = "hhhh 9969 9999" Dim b As Integer = CInt(a.Substring(7, 1)) - 5 &amp;#x200B; See if this helps. &amp;#x200B;
What is the problem you're trying to solve here, like just explain it in layman's terms. 
How about something like this Dim a As String = "hhhh 9969 9999" mid(a, 6, 1) = Mid(a, 6, 1) - 1 [MessageBox.Show](https://MessageBox.Show)(a)

I mean the person only type the first text box (the one on the top) they dont touch other text box from the picture the format they type is from a card that we get here in quebec ([http://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/health-insurance-card/Pages/description.aspx](http://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/health-insurance-card/Pages/description.aspx)) this one if its a male then they type in aaaa 9301 0711 (3 first letter of last name then first letter of first name last 2 number of years birth then month then days and the last 2 digit are random they doesnt matter) and if its a female they type in 51 (for january) 52 (for february) 62 (december) they add 50 on the month for female.... and if i type in let say phut 9351 0711 it will say the birthdate is 1993-51-07 so i need to remove the 50 in month &gt;.&lt; im so block on this code atm lol i need to add that code between those 2 IF If CInt(txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 1)) = 0 Or CInt(txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 1)) = 1 Then txtSex.Text = ("Homme") Else Dim DateFemme As String = txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 2) Dim DateFemmeResult As Integer = CInt(DateFemme.Substring(0, 2)) - 50 txtSex.Text = ("Femme") End If txtInitial.Text = txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(3, 1).ToUpper + "." + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper If CInt(txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(5, 1)) &gt;= 2 And CInt(txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(6, 1)) &lt; 8 Then txtDate.Text = ("19" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(5, 2) + "-" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 2) + "-" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(10, 2)) Else txtDate.Text = ("20" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(5, 2) + "-" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(7, 2) + "-" + txtNumAssurance.Text.Substring(10, 2)) End If
Make a string array and iterate to the 8th index.
Tools options international settings language. You may need to rerun the installer to pick language packs to install but I think English was default. 
You might also just split the string on the spaces, convert the 2nd element to integer, subtract 50 from it and then rebuild your string. Dim a as string = "hhhh 9969 9999" Dim Section() as string = a.split(" "c) Dim b as string = (cint(Section(1) - 50)).ToString Dim newString as String = Section(0) &amp; " " &amp; b &amp;" "&amp; Section(2)
Can you post how your code saves the data now? The only way you could save this would be if the exe is shared across everyone who uses it, which isn't a good idea. Even then it's getting saved in a config file anyways. You have two options. You can save this to a text file that any one who uses the program has at least read access to, or you can save them to a database (the preferred way) and then access the database to display the values. 
This code exports it to a Text file. &amp;#x200B; Dim thepath As String = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop) + "\\StockManagementExport.txt" Dim s As String = ("3PP \---------------------------------- Lenovo X1 Carbon: " + LenX1Carbon.Text + " Lenovo Yoga G1: " + lenYogaG1.Text + " Lenovo Yoga G2: " + LenYogaG2.Text + " Lenovo Yoga G3: " + LenYogaG3.Text + " HP G450: " + hpg450.Text + " HP Desktop: " + HPDesk.Text + " Mice: " + Mice.Text + " Keyboards: " + Keyboard.Text + " Wireless Keyboards: " + WirelessKeyboard.Text + " 2nd Hand Keyboards: " + OldKeyboard.Text + " 2nd Hand Mice: " + OldMice.Text + " Headsets: " + Headset.Text) &amp;#x200B; Dim objwriter As New System.IO.StreamWriter(thepath) objwriter.Write(s) objwriter.Close() [MessageBox.Show](https://MessageBox.Show)("Successfully Exported to your desktop.", "Success", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information) Process.Start(thepath) &amp;#x200B;
Ok, since you've got that. Is this text file on a shared drive? If so, you can distribute your exe and just make sure any computer that uses it has access to that file. Then they could read from the same text file. Let me ask you a few questions though, as this could become a really, really bad idea. How many people do you want using it? Will there be multiple people that can edit the file? Or is it one master program that's editing the file and the others are just reading the data. The reason I ask is you could easily run into file locking issues, where two people are trying to write to the file at the same time, and then also get dirty data problems where user a loads the program, user b edits one and saves, user a then edits the same one and saves without reloading the program, which in turn overwrites user b's changes, without user a knowing. This is really why you'd want to think about moving this into a database. 
But to answer your question, and I want to reiterate I AM NOT RECOMMENDING YOU DO IT THIS WAY. You would change this line &gt; Dim thepath As String = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop) + "\StockManagementExport.txt" To be a new shared drive that the other client computers can see. I also forgot, storing this in a text file means if someone has access to it, they could go in and screw with it, either intentionally and change values, or unintentionally and possibly break your program. Hence another reason a db is a good option here. MsSQL express is free and would more than likely handle your needs for a long time. 
The program isnt reading from a text file yet, thats what I need help with. The program literally just creates a text file from the data from the program. &amp;#x200B; I would like it to save to a file and then read that file and imput data into the program. There is only 2 of us going to be using it and 2 people with access. Also I am not an experienced coder and dont fully understand how to work with databases. &amp;#x200B; I can save to a text file, however I cannot find a way to read certain info from it . e.g &amp;#x200B; Line 3 = label3.text line 4 = label6.text &amp;#x200B; etc.
Yea so your problem is you would always have to save in a specific format to be able to parse it. That was part of my if someone edits the text file it could blow up your program. &gt; There is only 2 of us going to be using it and 2 people with access Famous last words :) As soon as this becomes useful, the company grows, etc it could very well get beyond that. You could even do this with microsoft access and use that as your data source instead of a text file. Honestly, think of a database table as an excel spreadsheet. You can have two columns, name and value. That's how you know what goes where, the name is the label it corresponds to, and the value is what you save from the text box, or put in the text box on load. If you really want to do this from a text file (again a really freaking bad idea) then just google visual basic read text file. It will loop through line by line, and so as long as you store stuff like value1 value2 value3 then in your loop you can just do label1.text = *the first line value* label2.text = *the second line value*
For me that link comes up blank. You can post it in a code block on Reddit
How do you do that?
When you edit there should be a square box to click, it will allow you to post code. It's by the bold, italic, ect
I can't do that. I'm on the phone.
www.pastebin.com That works too. Just select visual basic
This could be accomplished with a while loop. I don't like writing code for peoples homework so I've put together some pseudo-code for you to follow. Hopefully this puts you on the right track. &amp;#x200B; Declare 3 variables 1: Iteration counter to hold how many years into the future you want to calculate 2: Decimal value containing the dollar amount. This will also be your running total. 3: Interest rate to use, this should be a decimal number less than 1 to make the math inside the loop easier. Start a while loop to perform some action while the iteration counter is greater than 0 \- For every run through the loop you will want to increment the dollar amount variable by the current value of the dollar amount variable multiplied by the interest rate. \- Optionally: you can output your yearly calculated amount if required. I assumed you were just interested in the end result. \- Decrement the iteration counter to avoid an infinite loop After the loop ends output the calculated amount to the user.
Yes but it’ll cry and warn you. Explicit may error Dim x as string = nothing That will solve it
Since the assignments are happening right after the instantiations the IDE shouldn't\* complain about the declaration lines. The IDE should\* complain about the implicit cast from string to integer on the assignment lines. a = textbox1.text should be: Integer.TryParse(textbox1.text, a) \* If you are using Visual Studios you can set up your IDE to complain about these types of scenarios or have them ignored.
&gt; Dim x as integer = nothing Are you some kind of monster? &amp;#x200B; You don't need to initialize an integer to 0, they are already initialized to that value. The IDE warns about uninitialized object types, not value types. &amp;#x200B; The IDE will complain about the implicit type conversion when assigning the string Text property to the integer type. The answer above that pointed out TryParse is the way to go. The OP needs to make sure the string input can be interpreted as an integer before assigning it to an integer variable. &amp;#x200B;
I not really sure if it works or not but it's still bad coding habit. The .text property is a String value so getting a integer value out of it, even if the contents itself is just pure ints, It's still advisable to convert as you would on other PL's. You can try: a = CInt(textbox1.text) , etc. With this, a will be assigned an integer value from the converted string coming from textbox1.text &amp;#x200B; There are also other ways to convert, like: Int32.TryParse(textbox1.Text, a) or Convert.toInt32(textbox1.Text).
Just read it as a text file? Stream reader
Why do you need it as a resource if it is text? If it’s a text file that changes external just stream read it for your app folder. If it’s not changing externally just make a globals module and declare them as public’s. Resource files are generally for ui graphic files. 
Dim content As String = My.Resources.datafilename Then content.length should work
I'll check it out after I get done work, thanks!

Can you do this with just visual basic or can you only do it with vbnet? I've been searching for a solid while and it seems like I can't do it with just vb
Okay, I figured out how to convert the html of the page to text, but now I'm not sure how to find the specific id class for the html element. Should I hard code the element or no?
Are you trying to resize the text or are you trying to have a textbox appear from nowhere? You came change the textsize if AutoSize property is true. Change the text box width and height instead. If you are making a textbox already, use the .visible property.
Okay, so my friend suggested I use an index to find the string containing the phrase I want in the text file. So I made one but it doesn't seem to contain or find the html element that I want on the webpage. Here is my code so far: Imports System.Net Imports System.IO Public Class Form1 Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click 'Requests page and records response as text Dim webRequest As HttpWebRequest = HttpWebRequest.Create("https://www.google.com/search?q=usd+to+eu&amp;oq=usd+to+eu&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j5j0j5l3.3293j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8") Dim webResponse As HttpWebResponse = webRequest.GetResponse Dim responseRead As New System.IO.StreamReader(webResponse.GetResponseStream) Dim webResponseRead As String = responseRead.ReadToEnd txtDisplay.Text = webResponseRead Dim index As Integer = webResponseRead.IndexOf("knowledge-currency__tgt-amount") MessageBox.Show("Found string at index" &amp; " " &amp; index) End Sub End Class So it gets the usd to eu webpage and converts it into text. I then tried to create an index to find the specific html element id of the euro amount. However, it returns a value of -1. 
Okay thank you

You were searching for something that didn't exist as far as I can see and google isn't providing any class names that appears to be useful. &amp;#x200B; I suppose if you were to continue using google as the source, I'd instead use your index/searchresult search for the phrase '1 United States Dollar' because that would likely always be a consistent text that would appear (assuming you always are searching for dollar). &amp;#x200B; What you could consider doing is not using google, a secondary source, and go directly to the source. &amp;#x200B; This only seems to update once per day one weekdays, but this is the official European Central Bank itself - a newsfeed specific for dollars [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-usd.html](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-usd.html) &amp;#x200B; I'd look to see from what source google gets the information and go to that source and cut out google. Probably there is a simple rss feed that would give you the information and RSS html is very straightforward because there are specific agreed upon rules (or a couple of sets of rules so there would be an easy pattern to search for finding the information. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; What I formerly did for websites to search them is I went very basic ...I used the Inet api (meaning I got a direct handle for a website - a handle just like a local file) and downloaded the information as bytes and I had to determine the text encoding -either by the html declaration of charset=UTF-8 or else guess it if it was missing. Then I broke down each tag. I didn't use any web browser or really anything at all, so if you do go basic enough, you don't need a web browser or anything at all. &amp;#x200B; Anyway what I did find is that you can just use a simple text the way you do ... but sometimes there were errors. Some things are purposely obfuscated .... youtube for example years ago was fairly straight forward and you could actually see the source of all the videos in a second. You could view the source and type in '.flv' or '.mp4' and you've find the direct source and download it if you wish. Then they began to use reg expression and other things so that now each youtube video appears to have closers than not to a megabyte of text on the webpage (not including comments) when it formerly was perhaps less than ten kilobytes. &amp;#x200B; Sometimes the text of websites will purposely be written in hexadecimal or use entity encoding for part of it when it doesn't need to be ... or have extra spaces and carriage returns that inhibit some simple text searches. Sometimes the data you want is contained in a frame, which is really a separate URL, so you need to read the source of the iframe and then download that second url. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thanks so much! I thought it might have been because google was weird with their coding but I wasn't sure haha. Thank you for all that extra info it was really cool reading it; I'm definitely going to put it to use sometime :D Anyway, I'll try that link you sent and see if I can find a more consistent search term
Have you done anything with loops? Does your class ever cover functions or subs? Did you get a book for your class?
Make a simple app that does something useful for you.
I have a book but honestly it's really just annoying trying to read it; I'm more of a learn by example rather than someone who reads to learn. But no I'm 2 semesters in and we haven't even done functions yet... I did a little programming by myself and learned how to use io.stream and really basic indexing but I'd like to know more 
Yea I was doing that for a few nights but I'm out of ideas lol
you want to learn to program, you write code. There is no magic to it. You read books, you watch videos, you ask questions, but really it boils down to writing code.
Build a clipboard manager. Keep track of what is copied, identify what is in the clipboard, picture, text, hyperlink etc and store them in a listbox or for added challenge a listview that also keeps track of how often it is copied and when it was copied.
Thanks I'll try that out!
Do, or do not. There is no try. 
Try making a calculator those are always fun.
See this part of [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.random.-ctor?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Random__ctor): &gt; The default seed value is derived from the system clock and has finite resolution. As a result, different [Random](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.7.2) objects that are created in close succession by a call to the default constructor will have identical default seed values and, therefore, will produce identical sets of random numbers. When you add MessageBox.Show, you also add delay, so your Random objects get different seed and, as a result, produce different results. Try declaring your Random outside the While loop and only call r.Next in each iteration - this should help and produce more random results.
Thanks That fixed it. I would have never have guessed that the reason it wasn't working was because it was executing too fast
I'm not seeing where you initialize the variable newWeek. However, if this is working when you hard code week a or week b it leads me to believe your if statement is never true, so newWeek is a blank string, and it's technically working, it's just writing a blank string to your file. Step through and make sure your strWeek is actually equal to "Week B" or A. It might have like a white space on the end, a carriage return, etc and so the if statement is technically never true. It would also probably be good to put an else on the very end and log some error saying "I got text I wasn't expecting" or something like that. If I'm correct with your bug, that would have helped you troubleshoot here. 
doing a file open a 2nd time is going to reset the object completely, and set the pointer at the start effectively wiping the file (docs aren't specifically clear on this, but this is what it does). there is no method for replacing some content in the middle. you need to open for reading, and open a temp file for writing. read from the original and write every line to the temp file, changing what you will. close both, delete original file and rename temp file to the original name. 
Oh, so opening a file storing a value in variable then closing the file will also wipe the variable ? 
no, variables are what they are. are you sure you logic is right? the file has only 1 line and no CRLF at the end of it? are you even setting newWeek? I overlooked that you were reading the whole file. I generally use readline instead, makes any CRLF irrelevant. 
Yeah, all the file contains is Week A or Week B. That will be it. I have another program reading that file to display something. Before i have tried dim newWeek at the begenning of the file and it made no difference. 
give it a default value as well and see what that writes. I'm guessing there's characters in the file that you're not testing for. maybe loop the string and print the asc() value to make sure of your input.
How about looking at what a large number of other people have done? &amp;#x200B; [Planet-source-code.com](https://Planet-source-code.com) will contain some bad or middling examples as well as some good examples and you'll see how many other people have created complete coding &amp;#x200B; They have a vbnet section, though it appears to be mixed vb (sharp as well), but since someone suggested calculators, here are the results for calculators: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/BrowseCategoryOrSearchResults.asp?txtCriteria=calculator&amp;lngWId=10](https://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/BrowseCategoryOrSearchResults.asp?txtCriteria=calculator&amp;lngWId=10) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Download a few of them and see if you can follow along - can you understand what is being done and can you duplicate it (or even improve on it) in lines that you write? It will also force you to look up things when you come across new terms - or try to figure out a better way of doing things.
Here is my solution; &gt;! Sub Main() 'Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to n. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Dim n As Integer = 10 Dim total As Integer = 0 total = ((1 + n) / 2) * n Console.WriteLine("The total of 1 to " &amp; n &amp; " is " &amp; total) Console.ReadKey() End Sub !&gt; 
 Dim x As Integer Dim y As Integer For n As Integer = 0 To x y += n Next MessageBox.Show(y) &amp;#x200B;
Are you saying one element is A, or one element is A,B,C? Like the thing contains String1 if it has A, b, or c, or it literally needs the string "A,B,C"
A is one element, B is one element, C is one element
And so then if it contains one of those three, the the entire string1 is valid correct?
I only need all elements of the CompString elements to be found across all strings, not all of String1 to be found
So try this then. Anything where you need at least one match needs to be it's own string Protected Function StringContainsItAll(stringToCheck As String) As Boolean Dim itemsToCheck = New List(Of List(Of String)) itemsToCheck.Add(New List(Of String)(New String() {"a", "b", "c"})) itemsToCheck.Add(New List(Of String)(New String() {"e", "f", "g"})) itemsToCheck.Add(New List(Of String)(New String() {"h", "i"})) For Each listItem In itemsToCheck Dim valid = False For Each item In listItem If (stringToCheck.Contains(item)) Then valid = True Exit For End If Next 'if this is still false we didn't have one of the items, return false If Not valid Then Return False Next Return True End Function 'this one is true Response.Write(StringContainsItAll("a,eh")) 'this one is not because it doesn't contain e, f, or g Response.Write(StringContainsItAll("a,i")) 
Sorry that's still not quite clear. Strings don't have elements. Does String1 = "A, B, C" or is String1 a List(Of String)? 
My example may have been too simplified. each repents an element in a listOfstring so it would be String1(0) = A String1(1) = B String1(2) = C
I edited to give a (hopefully) clearer understanding how what I am looking for
Im having a little trouble parsing this. ItemsToCheck would be my contolStrings ( String1: a,b,c, String2: d,e,f String3: g,h) &amp;#x200B; In the forLoop checks each item in the lists if they contain something that is present in the list I am going to check. (A F I), and if it finds it, it returns true and exists the loop But in this case would it not find A, and exit the loop and not check if F and I were there?
You're on the right path yea. Basically we have a list of a list. The reason being, is you want to treat three items (a, b, and c for example) as ONE thing. So our parent list is that item, and the it's child value, is a list of the items it needs to have at least one of. The loop is a loop inside of a loop. So from a pseudo we're saying loop through all of my items within each one of those items, loop through all the possible values IF we have one of those, we can say we're good for the parent item, and we don't need to continue checking, because we found one If we end up iterating through that whole child item and never found one (so valid never got set to true) then we can exit the entire thing because we know for that particular item, nothing existed, so there's no point in continuing on. You can see that this StringContainsItAll("a,fi") will still be true. Here's how that breaks down What would happen is for the first iteration, it would say ok, my items are a, b, and c Let's check the first, hey it matches, no need to check this first item anymore, set valid to true and exit out of this child for the parent for loop then says, oh we're valid go on to the next guy The same thing happens for the second item, it goes the items we need to check are e, f, and g Nope it doesn't have e Hey it has f set valid to true and exit the child for loop The parent loop says ok we're still valid, next item Same thing happens when it checks for h and i, it finds i since you iterated through everything and never once got a I couldn't find any items, you return true. If anything parent item got all of it's children checked and NONE of them were true, it would instantly return false, because in your case you're saying it always needs to contain all of them. If you have StringContainsItAll("efghijklmno") and it starts to go, it can see checking the first item that it doesn't contain, a, b, or c, so there isn't any point in continuing on, you can just say it's false. 
Don't think that works man. your not setting x so there is no upper bound. Right not the for loop is going from 0 to 0 :) 
I wasn't sure how compleat you'd need it. I wasn't sure how high you wanted x to go, but once defined it does sum up all numbers 
all good man, thanks for the effort solution is valid 
Function Summation(byval n as integer) as integer Dim total as integer = 0 Try For i as integer = 1 to n total = total + i Next Catch ex as exception End try Return total End function
Ok I understand. So what should happen if an all the elements are found, but not in all the lists - say you have three lists and all the elements being searched for are found in only two of those lists?
Lets say you got textbox in each form. There is form1 and form2. You would simply need to do form2.textbox1.text = textbox1.text if you are doing it from the form1 and textbox1.text = form1.textbox1.text if you are doing it from the form2. 
And for value saving you make string(Dim value as string) and you can save it by doing value = textbox1.text
The problem is I did do that but instead of textbox to textbox its textbox to label. I tried to do that but it won't show up. 
The scenario is this: We have to make a quiz with a login and summary form. The username of the login used will show up at the summary with the score from the quiz form
Valid solution , good job. I like how you did a catch try as well in case it went sideways.
If you can't get a hold of the vb6 ide, you can use [MS BUILD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2017) with the [Exstension pack ](http://www.msbuildextensionpack.com/). This will be more familiar for it is more like JAVAC and will allow you to compile without the IDE. The basics are you create a xml like file that defines the build and call it from the msbuild.exe. Here is an example build file. &lt;Project ToolsVersion="4.0" DefaultTargets="Default" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;TPath&gt;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\MSBuild.ExtensionPack.tasks&lt;/TPath&gt; &lt;TPath Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\..\Common\MSBuild.ExtensionPack.tasks')"&gt;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\..\Common\MSBuild.ExtensionPack.tasks&lt;/TPath&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;Import Project="$(TPath)"/&gt; &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;ProjectsToBuild Include="C:\MyVB6Project.vbp"&gt; &lt;OutDir&gt;c:\output&lt;/OutDir&gt; &lt;!-- Note the special use of ChgPropVBP metadata to change project properties at Build Time --&gt; &lt;ChgPropVBP&gt;RevisionVer=4;CompatibleMode="0"&lt;/ChgPropVBP&gt; &lt;/ProjectsToBuild&gt; &lt;ProjectsToBuild Include="C:\MyVB6Project2.vbp"/&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; &lt;Target Name="Default"&gt; &lt;!-- Build a collection of VB6 projects --&gt; &lt;MSBuild.ExtensionPack.VisualStudio.VB6 TaskAction="Build" Projects="@(ProjectsToBuild)"/&gt; &lt;/Target&gt; &lt;/Project&gt; We used this with Jenkins and git to automate our pipeline for an old app.
The easiest for you would be a global variable using the Public keyword. In your first form create a variable; public myvar as string from your other form you can access it by just using hte myyvar variable. textbox1.text = myvar This is the easist method, th ebest method is to pass the variable to the new form when instantiating it.
Lol just realized that this was more of a quiz than someone asking for help.
When changing the text of a label you must change the caption not the the value. Try something like userform1.label1.caption = userform2.textbox1.value.
Can you show me the exact code you are useing? 
You can't go back reading a text file. What you want to do is use a buffer, where you read all the data into an array and then process the data in the array (Or a list might work well) or you could make a custom class and then make a list of that class.
This your answer. If the list of records isn’t too large I’d just shove them in an array.
I am trying to setup a questions and answer post so people can see how code can be put together. They will be all over the place for difficulty, thanks for answering :)
To be honest, rather than read them into an array, I'd define a class with the properties above and create a list of that class - then you're less likely have problems with incorrect index values while trying to access data in multiple arrays, or if you're using a single array, the bother of having to extract the information from a single string every time.
True enough but some people have problems with the concept of classes.
&amp;#x200B; Here are two methods &amp;#x200B; The first method is as Bonejob posted, but I'm giving a few more details. &amp;#x200B; I'm assuming that it's possible that the original form with the username may no longer be loaded (window destroyed) by the time you have the summary. &amp;#x200B; If so, the safest thing to do is have a separate basic module (those files always end in .bas). Many programs have a central module like this where they have functions or constants that all individual forms may need to access. Forms can be loaded or unloaded but basic modules aren't, so they are always available. &amp;#x200B; In that bas file you would declared as so, exactly as Bonejob described: &amp;#x200B; Public GlobalTemporaryData as string 'variable doesn't have to be that name &amp;#x200B; If the first form is still active when you need the information it doesn't matter, but if the first form no longer exists then you do need the separate module to save the data. &amp;#x200B; Public variables and public functions are available to every single other part of the program - private are only available inside that module or class, so by making it public, you're making it available to all the forms of your program. &amp;#x200B; And then when the username is entered, you would then store the username as so &amp;#x200B; GlobalTemporaryData = TextboxUsed.Text or more completely NameOfBasModule.GlobalTemporaryData = TextboxUsed.Text &amp;#x200B; if the variable doesn't have a local variable of the same name, you shouldn't need to use the module name (I can't remember), but it may help you to remember the source. &amp;#x200B; Then at the time of the summary, you'd post NewTextbox.text= NameOfBasModule.GlobalTemporaryData or if it's a label NewLabel.caption= NameOfBasModule.GlobalTemporaryData &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The second method is to use the clipboard instead of a variable. You probably wouldn't want to do this, but I'm just mentioning it so that you have another option and possibly you haven't used it before. The clipboard is available to vb6, vbnet, and any other language. &amp;#x200B; In vb6 when you are ready to save it, you would simply access the clipboard as: &amp;#x200B; clipboard.clear 'not required, but usually better to clear away other things, if only because there may be huge amounts of data left over from another program clipboard.settext TextboxUsed.Text &amp;#x200B; and it is saved to the clipboard .... if you used a notepad and pressed control+v, the contents would appear there too. &amp;#x200B; When you are ready to paste to the new form, you would go a so from that new form: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; NewTextbox.text= Clipboard.GetText() or if it's a label NewLabel.caption= Clipboard.GetText() &amp;#x200B; When the username is entered and fully complete, you'd use the clipboard to store it this way. &amp;#x200B; The clipboard is accessible throughout your program, so it is a sort of global variable. The only problem is that it is accessible to every other program. Windows itself won't clear it out, but if there's let's say a few minutes between the copying (settext) and the pasting (gettext) and the user copied something else from an html page or document, then the data you want will not be there and you'll end up with incorrect information - and if you're doing a quiz, the user will possibly copy and paste text, which will mess the data you've stored. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
This is the "best" approach if, like the following poster suggests, it is not too complicated for you. // This is pseudo code while not EOF student = new myClass [student.name](https://student.name) = read line from file student.grade = read line from file list.add student loop
I was able to get all the values from the text file in an arraylist, but now I'm not sure how to compare the strings. My logic is that I want to compare the two strings in the listbox and the array to see if they're the same(for instance "C" and C"), and then I would want to go backwards in the array and display the previous element in the names textbox. Does anyone know how do that? Thanks for all the help so far.
I would use a list instead of an array. Then use findall https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.findall?view=netframework-4.7.2
To be honest, that is WAAAAY over OP's level of programming. (No disrespect, OP - we started out sometime.)
 for i = 1 to N CurrStr = (current value of listbox) (do something) PrevStr = CurrStr Next i
you can use `open ... for input as #1`, `line input #1,...` `close #1` in a for loop, then `Mid$()`
One of the more important things to do is to type in the code rather than copy and paste it .. One of the reasons is muscle memory. Your brain will learn to get comfortable with typing brackets and curly braces etc without you having to think about it
Are we talking vb6 or vb.Net here?
I can't be sure about how macros work, versus VBA code, but chances are, the references to .dll's have changed. If you open the VBA editor, and go under menu item tools/references, you will see a MISSING: in the list of checked references. Probably a reference to the Excel or Office libraries. If you uncheck on the MISSING, and then search the list of UNCHECKED libraries, you will find that your computer already has a previous version of the library. If the excel spreadsheet goes back and forth between users of different versions of Office, that can be a problem. However, I once found VBA code that read through the references, and selected the appropriate library, and it worked (pretty well) on all machines in my project. If you want more advice, I would edit your comments to include the errors. Also, you should really be posting in r/vba which stands for Visual Basic for Applications. That is the flavor of Visual Basic used in Office.
Any clues from the actual error message?
I remember seeing a library error. I'll be more specific in the morning. The .dll info is interesting, so I'll def have to look for that code. If I upgraded my machine, would that likely solve the problem?

What are you trying to learn for? Work, school, etc.
School
Just grab a vb.net for dummies etc ebook. To start. Most website stuff is snippets and search results to your problem. Books are cool
If it's school then tbh there are any number of sites out there you can Google. But follow your course material and if you have troubles with your assignments post here. Good for you for trying to get ahead though. I used to tutor so if you run into problems feel free to message me
I would like to append your comment and say search this subreddit first, and if you don't find a solution ask here. 
Thank you very much!!, I had problem at the start but slowly I got it. Thank you very much for the help!!! 
I would like to append to your comment (Comment = Comment &amp; "") and say use Google to search, the reddit search is awful. Simply put "site:reddit.com/r/visualbasic" to the end of your search term in google to specifically search this subreddit.
Vb.net? I think he/she is looking for info on VBA.
You know that's not visual basic?
does this code look like the right solution? &amp;#x200B; [http://www.vbaexpress.com/kb/getarticle.php?kb\_id=272](http://www.vbaexpress.com/kb/getarticle.php?kb_id=272) &amp;#x200B;
Thank you. 
As I do realize this is a good place to get help from I was more hoping for a website or something that I could follow on my own and do tutorials. I know there are some code website that have this for java and the more used languages. I haven’t found one for vb 
It’s a little unclear as to what your using. If the firm source is excel then you can put validation on the cell to keep a set format. If it’s part of a text chunk you can parse it looking for a symbol and taking X number of characters and then copy that to a new cell and validate it then Key is to isolate the data to a cell so you can then use that cell as a named variable. You could then link it to a second worksheet and use that sheet as your pass on data. Again it’s unclear but you do need to find the data you want to use as seperate variables first I would think. Instead of copy and paste you can then just link it
I can give you so assignment that I had last semester for class
That code you quoted will do what it says it will, it removes broken references. In my project, I went one step further, I went from removing a broken reference to adding the right reference. I think it went something like this. I had a list of references to the various Word Object Libraries from versions 9.0 to 14.0 (I think) I think I tried each reference, and if it threw an error, I tried the next one. The nice thing is that you can reference them by using a string with the name, and the name only changes by a number, so you can even predict what future versions of the library will be called. 
visual basic 2017xD
Then I would read in the file using the stream reader (system.io.streamreader) create a loop to bypass the first 4 lines and then take of substring of 1,7 something like: Dim sr as new IO.StreamReader("YourFileOfLines.txt") for x as integer = 1 to 4 sr.readline() ' this will read the first 4 lines next messagebox.show(sr.readline.SubString(1,7)) Something like this should get you close
Let’s see it
There's a few links in the side bar under the Learning Visual Basic heading. Also, to remove any question, are we learning VB6 or VB.Net? because a lot of schools still seem to be teaching VB6 which is outdated by quite a few years. 
I’m actually not sure. It’s on the 2017 Visual Basic app. And I click windows form when I make a project. I think it’s .net. We are learning it because it my city a lot of the big tech companies still use vb 
2017 would be VB.Net. I would definitely look at the links in the sidebar. The (visualbasic for absolute beginners) one is follow-along videos that goes over the basics and works up to a little more advanced things like Classes. 
Well we are just now starting to use functions. I just wanted something maybe to get alittle edge 
Dim fileContents() as string = File.ReadAllText(filename).Trim.Split(vbcrlf) String infoYouWant as string = fileContents(4).Trim.Substring(1,8)
The string value of your object LabelVariablePay is "Variable pay" which isn't parseable as a decimal value. I'm guessing that LabelVariablePay is a label and you want to get a number from a text box or some other control? 
Something like Dim aAsDecimal as Decimal = Decimal.Parse(YourTextBox).ToString("##,###.00")
Add this to your textbox.text decimal.tryparse(textbox1.text, decimalvar) Basically if textbox1.text can be converted to a decimal, it will set decimalvar equal to the value in textbox1.
Yep the txtMAwhatever.Text is a string and your variable (MA) is a decimal. Try this: Use MA = cdec(txtmawhatever.text) instead. This will convert the decimals you’re entering into the text is from string to decimal. 
Also don't use labels and textboxes to do math. You should do all your math inside a variable and then display the final result in a textbox or label.
Since the function is returning a double.. you could wrap the call to it with a cstr(function) to convet it to a string before assigning it to the text box.
TextBox1.Text = (mathproc(Num).ToString()) Also, if anything in your input file is ever not a number, you'll get an error. In addition, this assumes there are always 4 lines. You'd be better off with a couple for loops Sub math() dim num as double for each line in IO.File.ReadAllLines("inputNumbers.txt") if not isnumeric(line) then 'throw some error here end if num += cdbl(line) next TextBox1.Text = num.tostring() End Sub 
I think a good learning experience would be to understand what the compiler is telling you - post the error messages and then we can try to work from there. That way you can go through the whole debugging process and see how the error message guides you to a solution, it's much better than someone just pointing out something that's specific to this piece of code.

how are you consuming the xml? When you read it using that method, do you assign it to a property? 
I’m reading it using dom api So I use the xml reader to read the xml Then I read the elements using that method Is there an easier way to read the elements of an xml? Please teach it to me 
I’m reading it using dom api So I use the xml reader to read the xml Then I read the elements using that method Is there an easier way to read the elements of an xml? Please teach it to me
What are you building? 
I’m trying to get the values off an xml and calculate some variables such as total amount and then write txt file with the new values as a KPV
Where does the xml come from? 
Locally. 
Are you using visual studio? 
Yes 2017
How much data is in the xml? 
It’s 5 sets of bills... with around 10 elements each set... so it’s &lt;bill&gt; &lt;element 1&gt; &lt;element 2&gt; .... &lt;element 10&gt; &lt;/bill&gt; ... &lt;bill&gt; &lt;element 1&gt; &lt;element 2&gt; .... &lt;element 10&gt; &lt;/bill&gt; So on 5 times 
You should be able to copy paste the raw xml as I directed above. Once you have a class file that models the xml, you can deserialize the read in xml into the class file as a object.
I’m required to load the xml into buffer... I can’t copy and paste it 
So when you call this method, what are you returning the results into? 
I’m loading the xml into a variable called doc Then I’m using doc.getelementbytagname to load every element into different variables Problem is that now every variable has 5 different sets of information within them
What "Type" is the variable doc? &amp;#x200B;
I’m away from my computer but it might be xmldocument 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28580857/xmldocument-getelementsbytagname-within-a-specified-block-in-c-sharp 
just convert that to vb
So this is what i ended up doing 'Declare Variable Allowance Dim VP As Decimal ' Variable Pay Calculation Dim MA As Integer ' Mobile Phone Allowance Dim HA As Integer ' Holiday Allowance Dim PA As Integer ' Petrol Allowance &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; '(1) CALCULATE VARIABLE PAY &amp;#x200B; MA = txtboxMobileAllowance.Text HA = txtboxHolidayAllowance.Text PA = txtboxPetrolAllowance.Text VP = (MA + HA + PA) ' Calculate Total Variable Pay txtboxVariablePay.Text = VP.ToString("C") &amp;#x200B; and it worked. I guess that's is what you'e describing.
YEah. Correct. It's a label with text "VariablePay" in it. So that when i run the code the text will be replaced by the calculation. IF i make the label black like remove the Text, then the Text "VariablePay" will be replaced by "" in the error message.
So in the Case "A" will be the added Allowances Dim A as Decimal = Decimal.Parse(txtbox.Text).ToString("##,###.00") A = MA + HA + PA &amp;#x200B;
Okay thanks a lot I’ll check it out
Definitely gotta look that up 
in a console?
Yes sorry I got it already! I’m sorry for the question!! Thanks
You could use a for loop with an integer variable to do this. Something like: for i=1 to 4 console.writeline(list1(i)) console.writeline(list2(i)) next 
&gt; Dim fileInput() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("inputNumbers.txt") This won't actually allow you to call fileInput(0), fileInput(1), etc., because you did not properly split it. What you should do is Dim fileInput() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("inputNumbers.txt").Trim.Split(vbcrlf), and then call Num(0) = CDbl(fileInput(0).Trim)
That’s exCtly what I did thanks! I tried it once and I didn’t work so I though there was another way but I was using the wrong variable 
I assume you mean Visual Studio. Have you restarted your PC after installing the framework?
You probably want 2 textboxes: one is your read-only text log, and the other is your input. If you want to make them look like a single console, you could play with the borders and background colors to match them up. Since you have a single input field separate from the read-only portion, you can easily read and parse the text from there.
This could be a fun project! The problem is the textbox control isn't designed for this so you will have to jump through some hoops. I would make the textbox control read only. Use the forms KeyPress event to capture the keystrokes (be sure to turn KeyPreview on for that form). You can change what is in the textbox dynamically. Look at the "ScrollToCaret" method of the textbox and the "AppendText" methods. Good luck!
Paste your code so we can steer you in the right direction (without doing the actual work for you)

Check the path. It is telling that the database cannot be found. check this path 'C:\Users\myxnq\source\repos\VBAssignment\bin\Debug\DataBasedata' for this file. AssignmentDataBase1.accdb
How do you validate that a variable a string of three initials meet the requirements of being 3 characters long. It cannot be below three it cannot be above three characters.
/u/jakebullet70 is giving you good advice. Also, look up what a relative path is. You could be assigning a relative path of "DataBasedata\AssignmentDatabase1.accdb" -- That will cause the operating system to look for the database starting from the path the EXECUTABLE file is in. This can be confusing, it is sometimes easier for assign the actual path, like "c:\Users\myxnq\Databases\AssignmentDatabase1.accdb" -- since the filename starts with a drive letter and colon the operating system won't consider this a relative path. Good luck!
Too complicated. Just created another project and copied the controls and code to the new project. I had tried everything I know and I'm not really a pro at VB.
What are you using to create the form? Is it a desktop application, web page? This site has some sample code in Vb.net for inserting records into access. https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorials/visual-basic-net/7258/adding-and-saving-records-access-database-using-vbnet.html
When you drop a button on your form, you can double click it and that should auto generate the "click" event for your code. Basically it's a method that fires when they click the button. From there, you would sanitize your inputs. Make sure they put numbers where numbers should go, something where it's absolutely required etc. After that, you would generate the sql to save it back to access. This can be manually done by creating the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE sql, but you'd want to make sure you parmetize everything. However, you're probably better off using an ORM like linq or entity framerwork. You can basically wire it up to your access database, it will automatically generate classes for you so you can do the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE stuff through code which is way easier. For example, the manually created sql to update would look something like this Using myconn As New SqlConnection(conn) myconn.Open() sql = "" sql = "UPDATE PtoCalendar SET isApproved = 'true' WHERE ptoCalendarId = @id" Dim cmd As New SqlCommand(sql, myconn) cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", id) cmd.ExecuteNonQuery() myconn.Close() End Using 'using myconn Using manually generate sql to read stuff would look like this Using myconn As New SqlConnection(conn) sql = "SELECT aspnetUserId, isHalf FROM PtoCalendar WHERE ptoCalendarId = @id" cmd = New SqlCommand(sql, myconn) cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", id) Dim reader = cmd.ExecuteReader While reader.Read 'do stuff while reading the rows Dim currentRowAspUsserId = reader("aspnetUserId").ToString End While 'while reader.read reader.Close() myconn.Close() End Using 'using myconn However, those same queries using linq (entity framework) are this Using db As New DbClassDataContext Dim record = (From p In db.PtoCalendars Where p.ptoCalendarId = id) If (record.Any) Then Dim currentRec = record.First currentRec.isApproved = "true" db.SubmitChanges() End If End Using Using db As New DbClassDataContext Dim userIds = (From p In db.PtoCalendars Where p.ptoCalendarId = id) For Each record In userIds 'do stuff while reading Dim currentRowAspUserId = record.aspnetUserId Next End Using It can get a lot better than those examples, but it's much easier to work in. 
there are timer libraries, but to do it without a library you use millis() and some variables. see the BlinkWithoutDelay and the Debouce examples and how to use it to do something after a time
I'm on my phone so this answer is a bit rough. Do a loop with i from 1 - 27 If i does not equal 12 or 23 Add the workbook name and i to a string Use that string to open the workbook and do whatever you want with it. Does that make sense? 
Thank you!
Thanks!
You can add a timer control to the form and put your code in the Timer1_timer sub Or you can do locking loops to insert delays like this 5 second delay example t!=timer do:doevents:loop while timer-t!&lt;5
No need to know the names, just loop through the work sheets. This uses the EPPPlus.dll but For Each ws As ExcelWorksheet In excel.Workbook.Worksheets For line As Integer = 2 To ws.Dimension.End.Row Step 1 Dim cellOneValue = ws.Cells(line, 2).Text.Trim Next Next Note, your numbers like where mine is 2 might change. But that's the jist of it.
check the formatting so when you post this it will show like actual code. something like = this 
Let’s open this with the fact that I’m genuinely not positive, however with some googling it appears that the formatting of the ‘insert method ‘ is off, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe it should look something like 'Selection.Insert xlShiftDown'
I could help with the code, but you'd HAVE to find the API that allows it to speak to the device.
I''m afraid I'm not entirely sure how to find this out, I use the Picaxe Editor 6 software for programming and [this is the chip I use](http://www.picaxe.com/Hardware/PICAXE-Chips/PICAXE-40X2-microcontroller/) if it helps
&gt; Picaxe Editor 6 I found the editor here: http://www.picaxe.com/Software/PICAXE/PICAXE-Editor-6/ (assuming this is the same thing you use) and it says it uses Picaze Basic, not VB. So I don't know how much help I can be as there is no documentation on the site.
Ah okay, I didn't know it used a different version of Basic, but thanks for letting me know this, I'll see if i can research a little further on the matter. Many thanks for your time 
I never used Python on NET but what about - [http://pythonnet.github.io/](http://pythonnet.github.io/) ? &amp;#x200B; Also you can communicate with Python not only due REST? REST is good if you want to expose Python's code to external world (other components/services/etc). Otherwise you can communicate through any typical IPC
Any reason you can’t just make a call to a script outside the. Read a result file in? 
I do this currently. what I suggest is that you take the Python code and create a REST service in FLASK. Consume the service in VB by wrapping the service using the [HttpRequest object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httprequest?view=netframework-4) or direct call from inside your asp.net. Either is valid, I would implement HttpRequest if you wanted to completly abstract the process from the interface. Then its easy to integrate you code into rest of your project base. Microservices are becoming standard. It is easy to upright python rest using [Flask Restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and docker containers, and you can expand upon the api as required to add new features. 
So I'm going to take off my dev hat and put on my team lead hat for this one. It's great you found some way to improve things and took the initiative to build something to do so. However, if the entire stack is in VB, that's likely what you were hired to write. Could you possibly just translate your python to VB? You obviously have the concepts down and a plan laid out, the biggest pain point would be googling syntax. Plus, it would probably be a good learning experience for you to get some foothold on VB as a language. Sure there are ways to run python scripts from VB but then you have an amalgam of stuff running where some code is calling some other code in a different language. That could quickly create a maintenance nightmare. Especially if you're the only one well versed in python on the team. I'm not trying to come down on you or anything, but if a new person on my team built some stuff in a completely different language and said "Hey I have this can we execute it somehow" they would get pretty much that exact response. 
 `Integer.TryParse(txtLSPennies.Text, intLSDollars)` `intLSDollars = (txtLSPennies.Text) \ 100` `lblLSDollars.Text = CStr(decLSDollars)` ... What??? 1) txtLSPennies.Text won't automagically mutate from string to integer, the string gets parsed and the value is assigned to intLSDollars (or 0 if it fails) 2) txtLSPennies.Text \\ 100 is not valid with Option Strict On because you are attempting to divide a string with an integer. You have to use intLSDollars instead. 3) CStr(decLSDollars) makes no sense since decLSDollars is already a string. You lack of fundamental knowledge. I strongly suggest you to follow this guides: [https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners)

1. Did you know you can convert C# to vb.net? If you can write it in C# you can just convert it. Here is one of the converters you can find online: http://converter.telerik.com/ 2. If I could see the code for each form I might be able to help you.
Really? Like convert the whole C# project to VB?
Also, you wanna see my C# project or VB?
You can use the converter I linked to convert one class at a time. It works really well. (I am assuming your project has two classes, something like "Form1" and "Form2") If that doesn't work for you post your vb code and I'll see if I can spot the problem. 
Use one line as a text box, and anything you want uneditable put in a label, sounds simple to me!
Start making stuff you think would be useful. My first project was an application that remembered what was on my clipboard. 
You will have to iterate through the grid control row by row checking for name/string matches to get the correct row. OR set the combo box items' ItemData to the row index on the grid for quicker matching if the grid row order doesn't change
Call it by name with the controls collection. Me.controls("combobox1")
Pls help someone :'( &amp;#x200B; Can't figure out what the hell is the problem!!
If this doesn't help sorry to waste your time, however you did not specify where/how your data originates: from a database? from a file? &amp;#x200B; A combobox (listbox is the same) per entry can hold a long integer value ... that could be an account number (if your account numbers are 7 digits or less) or a reference to the sorted order of a list that would give you a lookup name to a file or the account or something else (I'm not including that right now because it may not be what you want, so why give you something you don't need right away). &amp;#x200B; But for the sake of this, I assumed that every account exists as a separate comma separated value file that has the same name as the client name that was entered (and that no two clients have the same name). &amp;#x200B; Here are the routines I wrote. This is all in the first form that has a 'register client' button, a dropdown combo (called for me combo1) and an MSFlexGrid (named MSFlexGrid1). &amp;#x200B; \---- Private Sub Form\_Load() 'optional?, but makes it look more simple to the eye MSFlexGrid1.FixedRows = 0 MSFlexGrid1.FixedCols = 0 End Sub \---- Private Sub Combo1\_Click() 'to enter data into flexgrid from the combo, use the CLICK event - a click is a mouse up + a mouse down 'these two if then statements are just overcautious checks for errors on my part, in case a client name was entered incorrectly or other problems if Combo1.ListIndex &lt;0 then exit sub If Len(Combo1.Text) = 0 Then Exit Sub &amp;#x200B; 'assumes information was obtained from a file of the same name as the clientname 'the filename would be folder + combo list index as so: 'C:\\SomeFolderOnSomeDrive\\Combo1.List(Combo1.ListIndex) 'the list method calls up the text and the listindex method indicates the current selected &amp;#x200B; 'at this point the data is entered ...

A separate form just with textbox to enter a client name could actually be on the same form as the grid. Any form, any button or grid or any object can be set as visible or invisible and any object also can be set as the topmost object (like you're reading this right now on a web browser most likely and there may be another open window but the browser is topmost on the screen), so what you would do is you'd have a static picturebox (or a frame object) and within that picturebox you'd have the textbox and button for completing the register-name. At the startup, this picturebox would be set to invisible. When the 'register client' button is pressed, you would set the picturebox to topmost (method .zorder 0) and set the picturebox's dimensions to top=0,left=0, height =form height and width=formwidth (you might need a few extra code lines if you can resize the form) and after those to things, set this picturebox to visible. Then when the 'register' button next to the textbox is pressed, you enter the information in the combox as you did before, but just add the single line of code that the picturebox.visible =false. &amp;#x200B; It doesn't really matter, but just for a single textbox and button, a whole new form window isn't necessary ... if there's another reason, then you don't need to explain, but I though it would be helpful for you to see another option. You could even just have the textbox and button appear in the place where the grid would be in the first form - when you're registering, the msgrid doesn't need to be used, so set the grid to visible=false and the textbox and button to visible =true and then after registering, the grid becomes visible again and the textbox and register button become invisible. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Yes, please edit and post your relevant code. 
From a business perspective I'd say it makes sense to go with windows, as that's what you're most likely to encounter in the real world when dealing with excel, simply because it's a windows product. I'm not arguing PC is better than Mac or vice versa, just logically it makes sense to go the windows route IMO. I'm not sure what nuances would be on excel in mac vs excel in windows when using VBA but unless you're doing some crazy stuff, I can't imagine what you do in one won't run in the other. That is purely speculation though. 
This is what I was thinking as well. The carry over will be easier from windows to windows than from Mac to windows. I can get office 2016 for $10 through work so I will probably just do that and just run windows 10 on my MacBook so I don’t have to just get a whole new computer
Look, man, it's XXIst century, and your software doesn't even employ a [proper CRT emulator](https://www.retrovirtualmachine.org/img/gpu.png).
Are you using Visual Studio? Try placing a breakpoint in your skullmovement() sub and walk through it. Since you're using global variables, make sure nowhere else is changing the fast variable to 0 as that may be stopping them.
Below is what I have created so far: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Sub Main() 'Declaring Variables Dim num1, num2, Lownum, Highnum, loopcounter As Integer &amp;#x200B; 'Starting For Loop For loopcounter = 1 To 10 Console.WriteLine("Please enter 1st number to compare: ") num1 = Console.ReadLine num1 = num1 Console.WriteLine("Please enter the 2nd number to compare: ") num2 = Console.ReadLine num2 = num2 Next &amp;#x200B; If num1 &gt; num2 Then Console.WriteLine(“Number 1 is larger ” &amp; num1) End If &amp;#x200B; Console.WriteLine() Console.Write("Press any key to continue: ") Console.ReadKey() &amp;#x200B; End Sub
You need to move the NEXT to the end of the section that needs to loop, so before the *Console.WriteLine()* *Console.Write("Press any key to continue: ")* &amp;#x200B; Part of an IF statement is the ELSE statement where you can tell the program to do one thing OR do another. So in your IF statement where you write to the console the result of NUM1 being larger, follow that up with an ELSE statement where you can then add NUM2 is larger: *If num1 &gt; num2 Then* *Console.WriteLine(“Number 1 is larger ” &amp; num1)* ***ELSE IF num2&gt;num1 Then*** ***Console.WriteLine("Number 2 is larger " &amp; num2)*** *End If* &amp;#x200B; Note though, this does not check if the numbers are the same. But based on your description, that would not be an issue in this case. &amp;#x200B; For the second part of the program, you need to insert some extra bits into the IF statements: *If num1 &gt; num2 Then* *Console.WriteLine(“Number 1 is larger ” &amp; num1)* ***IF num1&gt;Highnum THEN Highnum=num1*** ***IF num2&lt;Lownum THEN Lownum=num2*** *ELSE IF num2&gt;num1 Then* *Console.WriteLine("Number 2 is larger " &amp; num2)* ***IF num2&gt;Highnum THEN Highnum=num2*** ***IF num1&lt;Lownum THEN Lownum=num1*** *End If* &amp;#x200B; After the NEXT statement you can then print out the results of Highnum and Lownum. &amp;#x200B;
How would I do that?
Wow, thank you sincerely in your explanation and with the provided corrections. I couldn't see the path, but now I do. I appreciate it. The only issue I have now is that when I add the command to display the results AFTER the NEXT line, it DOES show me the highest number correctly, but Lownum is always "0" even though it is not declared as such/ I did not input a 0 at all: &amp;#x200B; Here is the code after "NEXT" Next Console.WriteLine("The highest number input was: " &amp; Highnum &amp; " and the lowest number input was: " &amp; Lownum) Console.WriteLine() Console.Write("Press any key to continue: ") Console.ReadKey() &amp;#x200B; End Sub
you need to initialize lownum with a value of integer.maxvalue ie, Dim Lownum as integer = integer.maxvalue This way, you ensure that the next value is lower than what the current value holds. You originally initialized it to 0 so if I type 1 it will not store since 0 is lower than 1. 
And suddenly, it all works. Thank you so much, both of you! I sincerely appreciate the help, my head no longer hurts! 
I am curious, is there a reason we don't need to assign a similar segment to the Highnum? I ask only because I had thought that by the user inputting the numbers, that is then assigning them a value, so why is it able to keep track of the Highnum but not the Lownum without the above segment? Thanks for any input! 
NEXT is for when you're done looping, you'll want to use THEN during the loop
Excel doesn't use "Visual Basic"; it uses "Visual Basic for Applications", which is similar but different. You'll want to come to /r/vba . I have zero experience with Excel on Mac, but last time I checked (several years ago), Excel for Mac couldn't handle VBA.
Click on the margin of your document where you want to place a break point. There will be a red point at that line. Next time you run the program, it will stop at that line, and you can inspect the variables and such, and you can advance manually by dragging that arrow around.
based on positive numbers, any number entered is equal to or greater than the initialized variable which is 0 when not specified otherwise. So if the user enters 10 then 10 is stored into the Highnum because 10 is greater than 0. If they next choose 8, then 10 is still the Highnum. Therefore, when you want the lowNum, you have to start with something that is most likely to be higher than any number the user enters so that their input is stored and used for the next comparison. Again, this is based on only positive numbers, if you accept negative values then you would want to initialize the Lownum variable to integer.minvalue which would initialize it to -2147483648 
Ah thank you. As stated i am very much a noob so thank you for steering me in the right direction. 
yup, that's about right. you may want to check to see that `screen.AllScreens` has more than one element first so you don't get errors when starting with only 1 screen. `Cursor.Clip` is probably what you want for that. there are ways to release the Clip though, and your program won't be notified of it.
Wow thanks so much for that info. 
the tab strip? not sure what you mean otherwise. tabs are pretty common
yeah. that. thanks. didn't even think of that. found it in the tool box, TabControl. pretty simple. he kinda just rushed through it so wasn't sure what he did. &amp;#x200B; Anyway. Thanks.
I watched this video and I think it gave me cancer, this project is not being developed by a professional in any sense. 
Haha...was the only one I could find with what I needed. Doing an assignment so not so many options. Mainly wanted the payslip. 
are you sure you're actually saving it in the database and not just in the local object instance? we can't really help without code.
Take a look. thanks [https://imgur.com/a/1pRUreI](https://imgur.com/a/1pRUreI)
Spit out the sql string you're creating and look at it. This is a guess but I bet you're missing a closing ' somewhere. If you're searching by first name it's likely right where you put in your stuff to search by firstname. If you can post your code, I can probably help more. 
I would start with ensuring there is a space between ) and OR at both occurrences of the concatenations of your string.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you have a localDB instance. When you have this, you have a template in your solutions folder that is copied to your bin/debug folder each time you run the program. So any changes you make to the db in the bin/debug folder get's overwritted when the template is recopied on the next run. This is by design and when not needed, can be changed by clicking on the database in your solution explorer then setting the CopyToOutputDirectory from CopyAlways to either CopyIfNewer or NeverCopy.
since you're using access, maybe this applies https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/67b68979-bf82-4bfc-bb53-0955b6ddaeec/tableadapterupdate-does-not-save-data?forum=Vsexpressinstall 
Yes there is. Start with reading about ShellExecute and ShellExecuteEx
Ok thank you! I'd like to create a "menu program" with which i can select differente executable and run them by clicking buttons
you're a lifesaver. didn't see i was missing "LIKE" Thanks.
i was missing "LIKE" after "Email address" everything good now. Thanks.
Turns out that is the setting i was missing. changed it to "Copy if Newer" and it solved everything. Thanks so much.
Glad you got it figured out. As a side note, if you're using like and wild cards i.e. like '%someVal%' just know that can become very slow if you start to work with a decent amount of data. 
Shell execute is good for opening files by association. More "natively" you can use use `Shell`, eg `Shell "notepad.exe"`
 was just a minor problem. Guy below, CharlieMay helped me. just needed to change under my database (solution explorer) properties on **Copy To Output Directory** from the default setting "*Copy Always"* to *"Copy If Newer"* &amp;#x200B; thanks.
I used Shell("Pathname") and it works perfectly! Thank you everyone!
When you start getting into harder stuff, you'll want to look at `Process.Start`. It gives you a lot more options such as redirecting console input/output.
Oh ok! Thank you! Actually i’m programming for fun but it’s always useful to learn something more! Thank you! 
You're welcome. And honestly, `Shell` is going to work most of the time. I just wanted to make sure you knew what words to search for when it doesn't.
Gonna need more information maybe a code example.
Code example would be helpful. If you are inside a string, which I assume you are by mentioning the quotation marks, the {} is used for interpolated strings. So you can place a variable inside the string like this: Dim count as Integer = 7 Dim text1 as String = $"Here is my test string with {count} words." Console.WriteLine(text1) Output would be: Here is my test string with 7 words. The $ before the start of the string indicates it to be an interpolated string for use with in-line variables. 
Thanks for the help
The first is a set of Parenthesis, a solid curved arc. The second set are Curly Braces, the are similar but instead of arcing they flatten out midway and have a pip poking out the middles.
Not sure about Access or Excel, but [Kevin Drumm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q/playlists) on YouTube has some awesome VB tutorials that break complicated computer science concepts down into very simple explanations. Maybe check through his playlists and see if there's Access programming, too. If not, it's a great resource for many other concepts. 
SOLUTION
Okay......
Yes he can, but he will need to install the engine used to communicate with the database. Which I assume is either Jet or Ace (don't remember which is most recent or what you used specifically).
there is an actual /r/vba subreddit
Okay thank you! 
Why access and not my sql or any other free database package? 
It seemed like easiest way to make a simple database. Is there a easier way to do what I’m doing? 
Someone = In_Love()
You know if you coded to much when you start to dream in code. ;) Laughing aside. How many of s have went to bed and awoke with the answer?
There are tons of videos on how to install mysql. After you install it, it's easy to query. Please look at this video: https://youtu.be/iREruwN65KU Should be easy to copy your code over. If you need converter, then here you go: https://youtu.be/LUtU1GT-0Bs Good luck! 
For real. I catch myself figuring out the solution whenever I’m not even thinking about coding. As if it just comes to me out of no where. Crazy feeling lol
ha ha, You put the problem on a background thread in your own brain. Been there done that. :)
Okay, thank you! I’m at the end of class on vb.net but we never went over databases so I’m a little lost. 
Hey, i might be able to help with this. Is it VB.net?
Yep. All the time. Sometimes, you just have to go home, drink a fifth of whisky*, and go to bed. *optional, but recommended 
well only reason i choose VB is that there's an TrainSimulator controller of which I can only the get the VB script and code outputting data of the controls, so in that case it would save alot of work from reinventing the 'wheel' sort of speak... the UNIT is called RAILDRIVER and the SDK is available on their website :) so i was thinkin 2birds with one stone.. i do not know what VB.net specifically is compared to VB... i just ask for that language based on the only succes im having actually seeing data being generated from the device when i press button/axis/switches etc. thought that might be best place to start :O
Hey, G60FORCE, just a quick heads-up: **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
I'm not sure you can do this with the default drop down. Are you using telerik by chance?
There are after-market/custom libraries that provide more control over common objects like comboboxes - by redefining them, or providing new versions with differing names. Some are free. I don't know if any specifically address your problem, but I resorted to one when the grouping box (forget its real name) didn't behave the way I wanted. 
You mean the default DropDownStyle property? If that's so, I set it to DropDownList. I wouldn't happen to know what Telerik is.
I already managed to edit the colors for the DropDownList of the ComboBox so that its default BackColor is DarkGray and default ForeColor is WhiteSmoke, while selected BackColor is WhiteSmoke and selected ForeColor is DarkGray. Still no clue how I could set the border of the DropDownList to DarkGray.
You'll need to change the draw style to OwnerDrawn and draw the border, hover color etc... look for examples of OwnerDrawn combo boxes. 
I'm trying to do just that but I'm failing miserably when it comes to the border of the ComboBox and the border of the DropDownList of the ComboBox. Tried using Pen and Rectangle to DrawRectangle, but it didn't work as I expected. Also, please check the code I posted and see if I'm on the right way.
CORRECT BUT I DONT GIVE ASHIT
It's good to see vb having {} feature for string formating. Python added this in 3x version. I was using something like `"string" &amp; num.ToString` till now. Will try this out. Thanks
What have you tried in VBA so far?
If you want items to show in a list box you need to add them to the listbox's items collection.
Hey thanks a lot I’m away from my computer now but I’ll figure it out tomorrow. Another question based on that is will this load it before the program runs meaning all the dormitory prices listed? And if not is there a way to make them stay loaded in the list box items. Again I am not familiar with this yet and it might automatically do that but thanks again for your feedback!
Usually you load the first list box in the Form's Load event. When the user makes a selection the next listbox is load based on the users selection in the first list box. If all listboxes have the same items all the time initialize all of them in the Form load event. Consider using a database table to store the information for each listbox to allow changes to be made without having to change the program.
Any reason you can't use an invoicing software that already exists. I understand you're thinking I can build my own for free, but as someone who's built one before, they are WAY more complicated than you'd imagine. There are lots of affordable alternatives out there, and even some free ones, that will more than likely be much more functional than anything you can build, especially in excel. Now if you're doing it just for fun them more power to you. What you'd want to do is lookup tables. Basically in your other sheet you can say, pull data from this set of rows in this other sheet. 
I believe you need listbox1.additem "text"
I need it for VB not C#
I figured the proper command out thanks for leading me to it! ListBox1.Items.Add("Text")
Come on dude, do your own homework.
did you guys know that you can visit [instagram.com/homeworkbandit](https://instagram.com/homeworkbandit) for homework you need done, and we do it in two days.
It's not actually homework but if you insist 
you just laid out the logic in your post if 10 tickets are bought then there is a discount of 10% else if 20 are bought then there is a discount of 20% if totalTickets &gt; 25 throw some error
Listbox1.items.add(text)
Now that I have the variable I saved displaying, I need to add more text to it but the numbers I saved in the variables are integers. How would i go about doing that while still keeping the variables. For Example: ListBox1.Items.Add(AllenHall.ToString) is what I currently have but i need it to not only display the number stored in AllenHall.ToString but also "Allen Hall - (Integer saved as AllenHall.ToString)"
You are better off using listview or grid which will let you add multiple items on a vertical view but allow for different types. Alternatively you can put some sort of delimiter in and parse into types as you read from the listbox.
Hey I cant thank you enough and if you are tired of answering questions feel free to stop you have been very helpful. But if you still want to help here is my next problem: I have two seperate forms and two different list boxes. The problem I am having is transfering the selected data from form two back into a lbl (lblMeal). Now i do not have a problem getting anything show up there, my real problem is getting the actual number selected not the case Number. &amp;#x200B; For Example I click 2095 which is case 1 and the variable is meals14. And it only shows up with the case number in the label on form 1. I need it to show 2095 rather than 1 &amp;#x200B; The code i'm using to transfer the data across forms is MainForm.lblMeal.Text = ListBox1.SelectedIndex.ToString &amp;#x200B; Your help is greatly appreciated 
Hey, nschick, just a quick heads-up: **seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up: Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word". And your fucking delete function doesn't work. You're useless. Have a nice day! [^Save ^your ^breath, ^I'm ^a ^bot.](https://www.reddit.com/user/BooCMB/comments/9vnzpd/faq/)
I don't do web forms, but is there a ListBox1.SelectedItem option? If so then it would be something like ListBox1.SelectedItem.Text. 
Listbox1.text will give you the text you have selected in the list.
Not working for me I'm using vb this might be the proper syntax in c#. Thanks though &amp;#x200B;
&gt;Listbox1.text Thanks So much
No problem. Keep in mind that works fine for single selection modes. It gets a bit trickier if you allow multi select.
I think you took a wrong turn somewhere.
what do you mean &amp;#x200B;
When you say it's not working for you, are you getting some sort of error, or incorrect data transferred? If might be helpful if you can include the sub that shows your second form and the sub that transfers the data to the first form. (and let us know which form that particular but of code is in) 
I remember this assignment in high school! Generate a random number. Then, just do a while loop until the user input guess is correct, giving ‘if statement’ hints as to whether or not the guess is too high/low. 
That’s a neat idea. I will try this!
Hi, I've just seen your previous question and there seems to be a couple of issues. I'm sorry, but it looks like you've misunderstood parts of the question. You don't seem to have created a modules to hold the data and are adding data from constants in Form1 and Form2 separately. So - firstly I'd like to suggest creating a module with this code in it. As you can see, it creates two structures called `Dormitory` and `MealPlan` and two lists. one called `Dormitories` and one called Mealplans where the data is added. This answers that part of the assignment's requirements. &amp;#x200B; Youll notice that there is a fair bit of code here. I've created a couple of structures which will make the rest of the code simpler and less error prone. &amp;#x200B; `Module Module1` `Structure Dormitory` `Dim Name As String` `Dim Cost As Integer` `Public ReadOnly Property Details As String` `Get` `Return Name &amp; " - " &amp; Cost` `End Get` `End Property` &amp;#x200B; `Public Sub New(pName As String, pCost As Integer)` `Name = pName` `Cost = pCost` `End Sub` `End Structure` &amp;#x200B; `Structure Mealplan` `Dim Name As String` `Dim Cost As Integer` `Public ReadOnly Property Details As String` `Get` `Return Name &amp; " - " &amp; Cost` `End Get` `End Property` &amp;#x200B; `Public Sub New(pName As String, pCost As Integer)` `Name = pName` `Cost = pCost` `End Sub` `End Structure` &amp;#x200B; `Friend Dormitories As New List(Of Dormitory) From {` `New Dormitory("Allen Hall", 2500),` `New Dormitory("Pike Hall", 2200),` `New Dormitory("Farthing Hall", 2100),` `New Dormitory("University Suites", 2800)}` &amp;#x200B; `Friend MealPlans As New List(Of Mealplan) From {` `New Mealplan("7 meals per week", 1560),` `New Mealplan("14 meals per week", 2095),` `New Mealplan("Unlimited Meals", 2500)}` `End Module` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Part 2 .. &amp;#x200B; The next bit deals with loading the info into the ListBox in Form1 in the `.Load` event &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub MainForm_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load` `LoadDormitories()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub LoadDormitories()` `lstDormitories.Items.Clear()` `lstDormitories.DisplayMember = "Details"` `For Each dorm As Dormitory In Dormitories` `lstDormitories.Items.Add(dorm)` `Next` `End Sub` I've put the code in a separate sub so that you can use that code separately if you want to refresh the list without having to call the form's load event etc. &amp;#x200B; The same is in Form2 for loading the meal plans &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Form2_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load` `LoadMealplans()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub LoadMealPlans()` `ListBox1.Items.Clear()` `ListBox1.DisplayMember = "Details"` `For Each mealPlan As Mealplan In MealPlans` `ListBox1.Items.Add(mealPlan)` `Next` `End Sub` OK. Next bit. The code in Form2 that calculates the total cost should be in Form1. Have a google about the "SOLID" programming principles. S stands for "Single Object Responsibility" meaning that an object should have a single purpose. The purpose of Form2 is to choose which meal plan. Calculating the total cost of everything should be done in form1. If at some future date, some othere coder were to come along and be tasked with changing something to do with the total cost calculations, they would have to hunt through your forms to find the code. Not much of a problem with only 2 forms, but it is an excellent idea to practice the "SOLID" principles from the beginning. &amp;#x200B; So really, Form2 only needs to pass information about which mealplan as selected back to form1. &amp;#x200B; One of the nice things about Forms is that you can add your own properties to return values to the first form that called it. Bearing those things in mind, This is all you really need for Form2. Note the second line of the code declaring a property. We'll come to that in a moment &amp;#x200B; `Public Class Form2` &amp;#x200B; `Friend Property MealPlan As Mealplan` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub btnClose_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`btnClose.Click`](https://btnClose.Click) `Me.Close()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub btnAddMealPlan_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`btnAddMealPlan.Click`](https://btnAddMealPlan.Click) `MealPlan = CType(ListBox1.SelectedItem, Mealplan)` `Me.Close()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Form2_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load` `LoadMealplans()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub LoadMealPlans()` `ListBox1.Items.Clear()` `ListBox1.DisplayMember = "Details"` `For Each mealPlan As Mealplan In MealPlans` `ListBox1.Items.Add(mealPlan)` `Next` `End Sub` `End Class` Back to Form1 Finally want to add code to calculate the total cost if a dormitory has also been chosen. Now, with the Dormitories and meal plans as objects, its much much easier. So lets look at a simpler total cost calculation &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub CalculateTotalCost()` `If Not IsNothing(`[`selectedDorm.Name`](https://selectedDorm.Name)`) And Not IsNothing(`[`selectedDorm.Name`](https://selectedDorm.Name)`) Then` `totCost = selectedDorm.Cost + selectedMealPlan.Cost` `End If` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; Thats it! &amp;#x200B; You haven't detailed what your labels are called, so i haven't included code to update you labels, but that it prettty much everything I think. Good luck. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Wow thanks for this very detailed and helpful answer much appreciated.
Pretty certain that is a TabControl
No worries. I hope you pick up a couple of useful ideas :-)
Here's how you read a csv file https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3485883/how-do-you-read-a-csv-file-and-display-the-results-in-a-grid-in-visual-basic-201 As for the label. It would just be LabelId.Text = someCellValue However, will the csv only ever have one row? You may want to look at a data grid or repeater (depending on what you're working in) to show multiple lines
I would recommend the [textfieldparser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.fileio.textfieldparser?view=netframework-4.7.2) for csv files, it not only handles delimiters (commas, tabs, etc) it handles quotes. There is a block of example code in the link too.
I think you need a vertical index as well. So selectedindex(x). Tostring. By default you are getting selectedindex(0) 
You're doing the division but not assigning it to anything. Instead of (Total / 4) Write Total = (Total/4)
Without code it's going to be tough to tell but you'd basically just get them into a datatable and then loop through it. If you want to go to the effort (I'd recommend it) look into entity framework. It'll convert all your database tables to objects and then you can use linq functions to loop through and find data. However, this loops through a simple data table and finds stuff where and ID matches. Note that this is web forms so the response.write may not work in your case but you get the idea Dim table As New DataTable table.Columns.Add("ID") table.Columns.Add("Name") table.Columns.Add("Amount") table.Rows.Add(0, "Cheese", 1) table.Rows.Add(1, "Apple", 2) table.Rows.Add(2, "Bread", 1) table.Rows.Add(3, "Milk", 3) table.Rows.Add(4, "Orange", 3) table.Rows.Add(5, "Steak", 1) For Each row In table.Rows 'spit out the row Response.Write("Name " &amp; row("Name") &amp; " Amount " &amp; row("Amount") &amp; "&lt;br /&gt;") 'find anything where the amounts match Dim matchingRows = table.Select("Amount=" &amp; row("Amount")) Response.Write("Matches&lt;br /&gt;") For Each matchedRow In matchingRows Response.Write(matchedRow("Name") &amp; "&lt;br /&gt;") Next Response.Write("&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;") Next That gives me output like this Name Cheese Amount 1 Matches Cheese Bread Steak Name Apple Amount 2 Matches Apple Name Bread Amount 1 Matches Cheese Bread Steak Name Milk Amount 3 Matches Milk Orange Name Orange Amount 3 Matches Milk Orange Name Steak Amount 1 Matches Cheese Bread Steak
By list do you mean the generic list type, System.Collections.Generic.List(Of System.Data.DataRow), or do you mean a listbox control, System.Windows.Forms.ListBox? I don't see a Contents property or method in either of those. I think this is more a question of how to address the individual fields of a System.Data.DataRow. You retrieve values from a DataRow by using the Item property. You can pass in a DataColumn, field name, or field index. It returns a System.Object so you may have to CType it to the appropriate type. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, what you are trying to do is still unclear. &amp;#x200B;
Is there a specific problem that you are having?
If you update the select commands for the tableadapter then it should update the fields.
For the visual side of it, I'd use either the syslistview32 or else some sort of static window. The syslistview32 is probably easier - you'd have to set up the style to single select per cell and for each month you'd have six rows of seven columns and then just determine what day of the week that month starts on and then number all the cells starting with whatever day of the week is the first day of the month ... you'd set the font of the cell to something a bit small and have the text alignment be top and left. You could do as much with a spreadsheet (in fact the listview works exactly as a spreadsheet if you set up the style correctly). &amp;#x200B; You could also theoretically do the same with 42 buttons (6 rows of 7 columns) or something else. They just need to be arranged and treated as a group. &amp;#x200B; For recording dates and calling them up again (the back-end), I'd probably use an sql database, but I suppose you could even use something as simple as csv text file. &amp;#x200B; Assuming you're going for historical dates too, I'd record all the dates using dates as julian days, which is used in astronomy. Windows itself cannot properly handle at all dates into the past and fails before 100 AD (and in some cases not before 1601 AD). Microsoft's Excel has a problem with the leap year for 1900 AD that I believe it still keeps for backwards compatibility, so dates as microsoft views them aren't always accurate. &amp;#x200B; But you're probably not doing that, so perhaps what I'd also do is have the database have a separate fields for year, month, and day. This would also allow you to call up all events on a particular day without regard to the year (all the events in history on a certain day), or else on a specific day/month of a specific year. &amp;#x200B; To bold a specific date, I could do it in a listview, but I made a custom one and it's a bit involved - you could add a bullet or a series of bullet characters as an easy alternative. But if you want the bold, if you used 42 buttons you certainly could use that ... or if you uses a picturebox object (but in that case at the program startup you need to do a few quick calculations to determine box size per each cell and then draw calendar lines horizontally and vertically and drawtext all the date numbers). &amp;#x200B; And to write the text for each calendar day, what I'd do is when a date box is clicked, I'd use the DrawAnimatedRects api function and make a textbox window appear over the entire calendar (along with save/cancel buttons) and enter the data in there. &amp;#x200B;
Can anyone help me with figuring out how to code the “total number of pieces, total pay, and average pay” part of this? I can’t figure out how to keep a running count of all the data.

Thank you, ocdtrekkie, for voting on CommonMisspellingBot. This bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit. [You can view results here](https://botrank.pastimes.eu/). *** ^(Even if I don't reply to your comment, I'm still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!)
Here is a example... `Dim parts as integer` `select case parts` `case 1 to 199` `'do something` `case 200 to 399` `'do something else etc...` `case else` `'validation here` `end select` This is just a basic example if you are still confused post your code you will probably get more help. &amp;#x200B;
Keep separate variables that keep count when a case triggers. So every time case 1 it updated the variable total "totalParts" by totalParts=totalParts+parts etc...
I don’t think this sub exists to do your homework. You should give an attempt, post your code, and ask for critique. 
Gotcha, sorry about that! I’ll make a separate post!! 
Not exactly, I’m more or less just looking for a good place to start! 
Okay thank you!!
set the property of the textbox to multiline its default is single which strips crlf.
Multiline has already been set to two
use ControlChars.CrLf instead of new line. New line is just a line feed not a Carriage return. 
You want to store the information in an array or some sort, or a list. If you make a class say using name and number of pieces they made, and then make a list of that class, then you can get all the data into the program and then process it once the data has been entered.
I used this and it still is just showing up as one line. To be more specific I am trying to have each loop produce one line in this text box corresponding to the numbers entered. I am thinking now that I need another variable. I am just very confused. here is what my actual form looks like. It produces 8 for some reason.
[https://imgur.com/a/b0jL9x3](https://imgur.com/a/b0jL9x3) &amp;#x200B;
Thank you!!
In your loop, every time you execute the line TxtDisplay.Text =.... You are overwriting the entire contents of the text box. You should try.. TxtDisplay. Text = txtDisplay.Text &amp;....... This will take what's currently in the text box and append the next piece of info. 
This tutorial will help you: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_send_email.htm Also emailing a capture of that form is not really best practice. You should look at constructing a HTML email and sending that. 
What are your add / remove functions? You can pass the control you want to update into the function or the form itself. 
Best practice is a polite way of saying it's a really bad idea
Using your code as a base here is what I did; Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim intMin As Integer = Integer.TryParse(TextBox2.Text, intMin) Dim intMax As Integer = Integer.TryParse(TextBox3.Text, intMax) Dim intCount As Integer = 0 Dim Output As String = "" For intCount = intMin To intMax Output = Output &amp; "The Square of " &amp; intCount &amp; " is " &amp; intCount ^ 2 &amp; vbCrLf Next TextBox1.Text = Output End Sub
Thank you! i should've known that!
I ended up doing something very similar. Thank you for your help!!
There are two parts to your problem Sending the main and creating the image to embed in the attach to the email. To take the screenshot fo your form you can use this chunk of code; Private Function TakeScreenShot(ByVal Control As Control) As Bitmap Dim filename as string = "{Fullpath and name of file to save}" Dim tmpImg As New Bitmap(Control.Width, Control.Height) Using g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(tmpImg) g.CopyFromScreen(Control.PointToScreen(New Point(0, 0)), New Point(0, 0), New Size(Control.Width, Control.Height)) End Using tmpimg.Save(filename,System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg) End Function For sending the email the **system.net.mail** namespace is used to create the mail. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.mail?view=netframework-4.7.2 Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Try Dim Smtp_Server As New SmtpClient Dim e_mail As New MailMessage() Smtp_Server.UseDefaultCredentials = False Smtp_Server.Credentials = New Net.NetworkCredential("username@whatever.ext", "password") Smtp_Server.Port = 587 Smtp_Server.EnableSsl = True Smtp_Server.Host = "smtp.gmail.com" e_mail = New MailMessage() e_mail.From = New MailAddress(txtFrom.Text) e_mail.To.Add(txtTo.Text) e_mail.Subject = "Email Sending" e_mail.IsBodyHtml = False e_mail.Body = txtMessage.Text Smtp_Server.Send(e_mail) MsgBox("Mail Sent") Catch error_t As Exception MsgBox(error_t.ToString) End Try End Sub All in all attaching the image is a pain is the ass, I would suggest you just create the reciept as html and embed it as the body of the email. 
hey man all good, glad you got it working.
additionally, it's a lot easier to make an html email than it is to properly attach a photo that won't just be spam-filtering into oblivion.
I actually misspoke. I am using procedures with no return value to update global variables contained in the module. I am posting the module code in a separate comment.

Pass ByRef instead of ByVal
In the procedures (add and remove) try passing frmShoppingCart. I’m on a phone and can’t remember you routine names but something like Public sub AddToList(form as frmShoppingCart) Then reference the controls using form instead of frmShoppingCart. You could also pass just the control you need in the same way .... choose a variable name and cast it as the control type you want
Is that to say I should write another procedure for AddToList and have the AddToCart call it? I'm not sure that would work since the error I am getting is System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.' So my declaration of Public "frmShoppingCart As ShoppingCart" is not referencing the existing instance of the form. Therefore referring the frmShoppingCart in a separate procedure would result in the same error, right?
Additionally, for that to work, I believe there would have to be some type of event on the main form to retrieve the new values, which there is not. &amp;#x200B;
Well from where are you calling AddToCart? After a user selects an item?
You can PM me your assignment so I can get a better understanding of what you are trying to do if you want

You mean you never did it and you want someone to do the work for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ Here’s a link to my code 
nah. unfortunately i recently got a virus. i was able to restore my computer but before i started my project. I am really into computer programming but i am still at the learning stages. any help is much appreciated. Thanks again.
I concur with rendering the email content as HTML as it will save you some headaches. &amp;#x200B; Also, you may run into an issue with system.net.mail if your email server requires implicit SSL. If you happen to run up against that particular problem, check out MailKit.
If you've already done it oce its much easier the second time around. Something for when you work in the field, always have multiple back ups. &amp;#x200B; Take this as a lesson learned and move on.
Just a guess. Browser identification Your building a bit which is exactly what captcha is designed to block
I sub to this to try and help people and then it gets posts like this and the "can you send me the whole project" post yesterday :/
I wouldn't agree that it's a bot. The goal isn't to automate any actions. The goal is simply to read information from my account on the screen once I log in. I could do the exact same thing by grabbing control of a standalone browser and pulling information off, but I'd like do it all within the program.
I fail to see the point or relevance of this post...
Well post the code you have at least.... We won't write the entire thing for you 
Public Class frmtrafficlight Private Sub TxtGreenLight_GotFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtGreenLight.GotFocus txtGreenLight.BackColor = Color.Green End Sub Private Sub txtGreenLight_GotFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtGreenLight.Leave txtGreenLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray End Sub Private Sub txtRedLight_GotFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtRedLight.GotFocus txtRedLight.BackColor = Color.Red End Sub Private Sub txtRedLight_Leave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtRedLight.Leave txtRedLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray End Sub Private Sub txtYellowLight_GotFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtYellowLight.GotFocus txtYellowLight.BackColor = Color.Yellow End Sub Private Sub txtYellowLight_Leave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtYellowLight.Leave txtYellowLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray End Sub End Class
im getting an error on the first line, it says theres multiple definitions txtGreenLight\_GotFocus so i changed it to TxtGreenLight\_GotFocu but i still get an error
What is the other error you get? I would delete the txtgreenlight stuff and do those again. one of the txtgreenlight_focus subs is handling the 'leave' event. 
Instead of using the [GotFocus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.gotfocus?view=netframework-4.7.2) event i just used the Enter event, it's the first event that triggers when the control (technical term for objects on the form) becomes active. so what i did: when the form loads (Form1_Load event) i set all boxes to darkgray. otherwise they would all start as white (or whatever their default color is, you could phase out these first 3 lines by changing their default backcolor to darkgray before compiling in the properties window of each textbox). next i set the first textbox, txtGreenLight to active by using the [Select](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.select?view=netframework-4.7.2) method. the rest of the program is just events (entering and leaving the textboxes) changing the colors. i put comments throughout the program to explain what i'm doing. if you have questions i can answer them. Public Class Form1 Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load txtGreenLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray txtRedLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray txtYellowLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray ' set every box to gray to start txtGreenLight.Select() 'select (set active) the green light first, so when the form starts not ALL boxes are gray. green will be lit at the start now End Sub 'Enter logic: Private Sub txtGreenLight_Enter(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtGreenLight.Enter txtGreenLight.BackColor = Color.Green ' we are using the "enter" event here to change the color to green when the txtgreenlight box becomes the active control End Sub Private Sub txtYellowLight_Enter(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtYellowLight.Enter txtYellowLight.BackColor = Color.Yellow End Sub Private Sub txtRedLight_Enter(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtRedLight.Enter txtRedLight.BackColor = Color.Red End Sub 'Leave logic: Private Sub txtGreenLight_Leave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtGreenLight.Leave txtGreenLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray 'so when you tab out to the next box, a "leave" event is triggered which tells it to go gray. End Sub Private Sub txtYellowLight_Leave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtYellowLight.Leave txtYellowLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray End Sub Private Sub txtRedLight_Leave(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles txtRedLight.Leave txtRedLight.BackColor = Color.DarkGray End Sub End Class 
I got it to work but yellow won't light up. It stays dark gray. I did it using the original code I was using before. When I hit tab it cycles through normally but when it gets to yellow it just stays dark gray
make sure the tab index is set up correctly in the form designer. for example green 0 yellow 1 red 2 
Ok I'll try that now, thank you. You guys are awesome
The "True" at the end of your WriteAllText is telling it to append the text. Change it to False. Be sure to pay attention to intellisense when writing these things. It will inform you. 
Oh right, it's that simple. Thank you very much.
I figured it out, I had two txtYellowLight_GetFocus There was no txtYellowLight_Leave. Therefore the back color on the Focus event would stay gray. Once I added the leave to the back color yellow it's worked fine
In the properties window in the TextBox press the arrow on the right and then press enter to start each new line 
That is the definition of a "bot" and it is defiantly browser identification.
Have you tried using the text changed event for the textbox instead of a keypressed event?
Nope, the only thing I learned how to handle was KeyPress. Some people told me to use Validating and Validate. What's the difference between these and TextChanged?
This, use text changed event.
Agree, this is a bot. Next thing you will try is to open up a real browser and move the mouse around and captcha it. You should see if the site has an API for reasons you are trying to access things. If not, you are most likely SOL
Text changed is triggered any time the text in the textbox is changed.
I agree with ostreddit and would use the textchanged. textchanged is an automatically created routine by VBNet for the textbox. &amp;#x200B; That routine will be called up any time the textbox changes text ... either through deletions or adding characters (but not something like pressing an arrow key left/right) &amp;#x200B; within that textchanged routine if no numbers, then exit, otherwise VBNET has an internal routine to edit the numbers mostly as you want them. &amp;#x200B; This is an example of usage: [http://www.vb-helper.com/howto\_net\_format\_number.html](http://www.vb-helper.com/howto_net_format_number.html) &amp;#x200B; It has more options than you want, but I do believe it accommodates what you are seeking. &amp;#x200B; The rest of this is my answer about user input. If I use a term you don't recognise, I apologise. &amp;#x200B; With small things like a textbox for numbers there's nothing wrong with dynamically handling user input - I do it too for certain things with numbers. &amp;#x200B; But it can get very complicated even with numbers. For example ten and a half euros in Germany is properly typed in as 10,5 but in other countries it would be 10.5 &amp;#x200B; Which is correct? There is a Windows local input that determines things like currency marks and how time is formatted. Do you go by that or do you just decide that there should only be one way? There's a swiss format too, by the way. &amp;#x200B; Sometimes it's easier to have a single error check at the end of the entering process. If you've ever filled out an online form that you need to submit, often times you enter something incorrectly and it doesn't try to dynamically do it - just when you hit the send button, you get a Failure and some textbox is highlighted. Dynamically trying to handle all the possible changes can get too complicated in may cases and if there are 10 or more things you're checking for per every character press, it waste a bit of processing time and slows things down. &amp;#x200B; It would not slow it down at all if it's just a matter of you typing in 10.5 or any simple number, but a textbox that has 1 megabyte's worth of characters will get noticeably slower if you are dynamically editing it &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Windows itself provides a built in style for the numbers-only for a textbox and maybe one or two other simple styles, but another issue with VB is that you don't have direct access to the process for the textbox (or other classes). &amp;#x200B; What I mean is this: &amp;#x200B; [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633573(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633573(v=vs.85).aspx) &amp;#x200B; It's from C++, but you can do it VBNET [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.wndproc?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.wndproc?view=netframework-4.7.2) &amp;#x200B; I may be wrong but I believe using the API would be quicker than using the vbnet way of doing it (I mean writing it almost like the c++ win32 way would be quicker) &amp;#x200B; but when you have that SomeTextbox\_KeyPress(sender As Object, e As KeyPressEventArgs) in VBNET, internally there's the WinProcess for that textbox that Windows processes first .... and then and only then does it send the results of that to the VBNET \_KeyPress. So it's always a bit slower when you're trying to manipulate it through the \_KeyPress &amp;#x200B; There are dozens or perhaps hundreds of messages for every textbox and VBNet normally winnows most of those out ... however if you really want full control to manipulate everything, you'd do it in the WinProcess. &amp;#x200B; I haven't used winprocess in VBNet, so I'm assuming that it gives you full control. Someone mentioned OwnerDrawn in that post where you asked about comboboxes and OwnerDraw in C++ (and even vb6) meant complete control, but also more complicated - and it's not something you can do in just a few lines or just a few hours. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; You'd be able to edit the combobox colours ... but you'd also be responsible for drawing every single line, every single colour. For example with a button, if a button is supposed to look like it's 'clicked' when the mouse is down, you are responsible for drawing shaded edges, drawing a different colour to indicate a click, and you are responsible for redrawing that button when the mouse clicks up and the button is restored. If you don't draw those lines, windows registers a click, but a user doesn't see the click. &amp;#x200B; For a combobox, you'd be responsible for drawing the little down arrow at the side if you want a dropdown box and you'd be responsible for keeping track of the data and deleting it as well as making sure it is drawn in the textbox part of the combobox (if you use window spy or something that lets you look at any window's style, you'll see a combobox is not a single class, but has separate parts to it). &amp;#x200B;
nah you can change the user agent of the browser control to mask it.
Awesome, thank you so much for the effort you put into this answer. It made so many things clear to me, and you explained the way I should handle this challenge instead of giving me an answer like "here's the code, take this and it'll work". Really appreciated! 🙂

Hmmm, good idea
The [datediff](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.dateandtime.datediff?view=netframework-4.7.2) method has those functions. Dim days As Long = DateDiff(DateInterval.Day, date1, date2)
thanks 
You can also do it with a timespan. Dim NbDays As Integer = (date2 - Date1).Days
Maybe you're going into this at a later date, but you're storing passwords in plain text and also not sanatizin your sql inputs. If someone wrote something along the lines of '; drop table login; in your username text box, you'd have a bad day Also, you're connection string should be in a config file somewhere, not the form, and if you really are connecting in with SA, you should have your own user that only has access to that database. Maybe you're covering all that later?
thanks sir. can you write code sir
I can. Been writing in VB and C# almost daily for about 10 years now. 
i don't load treeview using sqlserver can you help me sir for that
This is painfull to watch. Not organzied, code is not stong, structure of project is wrong. Not using binding classes, no buiness logic in sperate objects, no ORM use. This is just wrong, dont do it this way.
Totally aggree with andrewsmd87's comments and would like to add that there is NO REASON to pull the password from the database. You could simply SELECT Username From... and if a row is returned then the proper password was entered, otherwise no row would be found against the input. You should google Sql Injection, and Hashing passwords and read up on this so that you're not teaching unsafe programming to people trying to learn data access.
This is the .Net way, DateDiff is part of the visualbasic namespace and was used for backward compatibility from legacy vb6 code conversion. We should be trying out best to quit using them by now.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff648339(v=pandp.10)
thanks sir
any one watched my video ?any comment
it's not `update()`, just `update`, it's a statement, not a function. you don't need to select to run an update. you almost certainly want a where clause on that update. I dont' see where you're actually using `Str` I don't know what you mean "instances" you didn't include your schema or sample dataset, so it's really not clear to us what you're trying to accomplish. 
I'm maybe blind, but where is If ValidateInputs(...)'s End If?
What exactly are you clicking? If it's the user control, why not use its click event? Sorry if I'm not seeing something obvious.
Once I get past this hurdle there are several things that will be clickable. Right now I'm just trying to click the key picture box to make the rank say hello, tried with he two buttons in the bottom as well and nothing. Once I get one of the things inside the control to say hello the next test is going to be reading the record I sent it via the import command and shoving all the data in the right places. Eventually there will be a number of features like; * Clicking the Apple Core will make it switch between Green(on) and Black(Off), It's sort of a favorite button. * Clicking the +/- Button will make the Quantity in the text box go up or down by the minimum Quantity, update a couple of the labels (Order Cost and GM$) to a calculated value and fire off an SQL statement to put the ProdID and that Quantity in a table for later use. * Same if the user inputs a quantity in the box manually it will have to round out to the closest minimum quantity and then do the math and SQL There are other (optional) things that I will likely have to handle outside the Control itself as well like * Some of the labels (like Class) will have clickable links that will pull up all "similar" items but only when those items exist. While others (Like Sold 60) will pull up more info on how well that item is selling. * The Big Picture box in the middle if clicked will open a form with a bigger version of the picture. Though in all honesty it would be nice if I could just code those inside the UserControl and then have it tell the form it's in "Here's the form I want you to open and any relevant info that form needs" I want this thing to be as self contained as possible because the Control itself may be reused in other forms as I get the go ahead to expand the project and I really don;t want to re-code all the handlers every goddamn time because that defeats the entire purpose of making a user control in the first place. 
you might try posting this is /r/vba for more to see.
Can you tell me how to react so I can avoid forming an opinion myself? Thanks. 
Can you go over your use case with me? Like don't worry about the technical aspects, what is the problem you're trying to solve?
I did a runtime creation for Label and Textbox when ever i pressed enter and both of them are lying above each other, anyway i want whenever i double clicked the label to hide it and show the textbox then when i press enter in the textbox the label will show again and the textbox will be hidden. remember that these items created while the program is running and everyone of them is assigned to a value in an array. &amp;#x200B; i hope u understand me XD
Not really. So are you saying you have a form where they click a label and it adds a text box for them, and they can do this as many times as they want?
Why not just enable or disable the textbox in double click instead of replacing it with a label?
Nice idea! but i think when the textbox is disabled i can't double click it
Nvm, i used .ReadOnly instead of .Enabled thanks guys
You might be right. Try the read-only property. 
&lt;&gt; in VB is not equal. So if variable1 is something other than 2 the if statement is a true condition.
that's exactly what it is. it's the same as != in other languages, though you can also do `if not var = 2...` 
City / State is not a valid field name, try [City / State]. But I'd recommend renaming the field altogether myself. Also, do not get in the habit of building your sql statements like this. You should be using parameters to make your statements secure against not only SQL injection attacks but string formats, ie, what would your sql statement look like if you entered a name like Jack O'reily?
Thank you so much, that fixed my problem. To be honest, I know I should use the parameters to update it. This is my final project for a business [vb.net](https://vb.net) class. My teacher has no idea how to use databases, and I am pretty conformable with SQL, so I am just doing what I know. I did try Jack O'Reily and it crashed the app, If i have time i will try to go back and make it work with parameters. Where would be a good place to start? &amp;#x200B; Thanks!
Converting to use Parameters is quite easy with what you already have. It's just a matter of defining them. So your update statement could become: myStrSQL = "UPDATE Invoices SET Name = @name, Address =@addr, [City / State] = @CtySt WHERE InvoiceID = @invId " then after the line where you create the command mySqlCmd = New System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand(myStrSQL, myConnection) you would just start adding the parameters and their values mySqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", Namei.Text) mySqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@addr", Address.Text) ... etc, until you have defined all that you have in your statement. The rest is same. The only thing I'm not sure of is if mySQL uses the @ or ? for parameters off the top of my head so you may need to google `using parameters in a mySQL update statement` 
Okay, and if I do that I will be able to use things with ‘s in them? 
Yes, and it will protect your code from allowing SQL injection (another search worth read up on) 
Okay, I will read up on that! Just to clarify the rest of my code stays the same correct? 
It should, because you defining the parameters against the command object and you still execute that object the same way you did originally. 
Thank you so much for your help! 
No problem, and if you get stuck, we're still here ;) 
Beyond the parameters thing. Once you get the hang of sql look into entity framework or other various ORMs (I bet they have one for mysql) Then, outside of crazy complex queries, you CRUD the data using objects. It's a lot easier. 
&gt;100% Upvoted I got the parameters to work for update and insert statements. It honestly is so much cleaner to do it that way. The code is a lot less confusing to look at.
I'll look into that, thanks!
that's the Change event, not the KeyPress event. 
And there was the problem, thanks!
The problem is "C:\Users\Dave"...this basically means that the computer needs to have a user account called Dave, plus all the subfolders below that have to exist. Instead, use a part like a temp folder. For the path you could do something like Environ("temp") &amp; "Computer Template.dotx" This also means that the template has to live in that folder, so that you can create a new document based on it.
This might be a stupid question but where is the temp folder at? 
It can vary from computer to computer, that's why I used Environ("temp") so it can use whatever value is being held by that Windows environment variable.
Check out https://www.newtonsoft.com/json it is a library for .net (VB and C#) that allows easy serialization and binding of a json document. With this tool it is much easier to create a dataset that can be searched and manipulated. It also has the ability to do Create, Update, Delete right in memory, and write back out to the json format. 
As someone mentioned, newtonsoft is a good .net JSON library. If you're using the newer versions of VS, you can copy one object of the data, and then in VS go to edit -&gt; paste special and paste JSON as classes and it'll auto generate the classes for you. You can then read the json, use newtonsoft to deserialize it into classes, and then work with objects. If you run into trouble, paste me like 2 or 3 of the objects from your json and I can get you some code to get started on 
So how do I get my file into the temp folder? 
As others said, newtonsoft is your best bet. I just learned the library for one of my projects and it really does make it easier. I'm at work so cant provide much, but once you have your card class and get the json data from the file, try something like this Dim listCards As List(Of Card) = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(Of List(Of Card)(your variable containing json string here) If you want to convert the C# examples in the Newtonsoft documentation, I used converter.telerik.com
You just have to copy it there. In File Explorer, type `%TEMP%` in the address bar and press Enter. That'll take you to the temp folder on the given computer.
This happens every single time... 1 person responds that can potentially help me THEN RADIO SILENCE... omfg help me please!!!
no worries thanks for your help I'll see how I go!!!
Thanks for telling me what to look for, I'll see how I go with finding specifics!!! 
yeah I'll see if I can convert their examples, because most of their samples aren't in [vb.net](https://vb.net) hahaha
Glad to see you making use of our API! I hope it has been helpful to you!
if yo need help just use a C# to vb.net converter. http://converter.telerik.com/ 
The SQL is valid and it will run fine even without a valid invoice id, which is why your code says everything ran fine regardless of the @ID passed to it &amp;#x200B; ExecuteNonQuery() should return an int32 that contains the number of rows affected by the query. You could use that to check for a non-zero value indicating a success, or if it's zero you can pop up a 'not found' message.
So I tried that but now even valid records are not working. 'Command to enter SQL statement using the Data Connection mySqlCmd = New System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand(myStrSQL, myConnection) mySqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ID", TextBox1.Text) ' Open the connection, update the records and close the connection myConnection.Open() mySqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery() If mySqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery = 0 Then MessageBox.Show("No Entry Found with that InvoiceID", "FAILURE") TextBox1.Text = "" TextBox1.Focus() myConnection.Close() Exit Sub End If myConnection.Close() MessageBox.Show("Entry Deleted", "SUCCESS") Me.InvoicesTableAdapter1.Fill(Me.ComputerRepairDataSet1.Invoices) TextBox1.Text = "" TextBox1.Focus() End Sub &amp;#x200B;
That's going to fail all over the place as you aren't catching the value from the function, you are expecting the function itself to have the int32. &amp;#x200B; See the following (untested) code: Dim mySqlCmd As System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand 'connection Dim myConnection As System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection = New System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection("Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\ComputerRepair.mdf;Integrated Security=True") 'SQL Insert Statement Dim myStrSQL As String Dim numAffected as Integer Try myStrSQL = "DELETE FROM Invoices WHERE [Invoice ID] = @ID" If MessageBox.Show("Do you really want to Delete this Record?", "Delete", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Warning) = DialogResult.No Then MsgBox("Operation Cancelled") Exit Sub End If Catch ex As Exception MessageBox.Show("Something went wrong, Please try again", "FAILURE") End Try 'Command to enter SQL statement using the Data Connection mySqlCmd = New System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand(myStrSQL, myConnection) mySqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ID", TextBox1.Text) ' Open the connection, update the records and close the connection myConnection.Open() numAffected = mySqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery() myConnection.Close() If numAffected &gt; 0 MessageBox.Show("Entry Deleted", "SUCCESS") Else MessageBox.Show("Invoice ID not found", "INVALID ID") End If Me.InvoicesTableAdapter1.Fill(Me.ComputerRepairDataSet1.Invoices) TextBox1.Text = "" TextBox1.Focus() &amp;#x200B;
That works perfectly, thank you! 
Also if the reader is confused, i have a variable declared as "License" because i have tried different methods of achieving my goals. I forgot to remove that line before posting.
Can you post your actual code? Without that, can't help much.
well what i was gonna use isnt working but ill show you. Private Sub btnWin\_Click(Sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles [btnWin.Click](https://btnWin.Click) DIM Wins, Loses, Percent Wins = (txtBoxWins.Text) Loses = txtBoxLoss.text) Perecent = (Wins/Loses) \* 100 TextBox3 Str (Percent) &amp;#x200B; End Sub
but obviously that isnt gonna work, shouldnt i be putting As Interger In there some where? im lost...
OK when you declare variables you have to declare them as a type. I.E. Dim j as string or Dim Random_Number as integer Opening brackets and closing brackets have to match you have to use consistent names, perecent &lt;&gt; percent you don't want to take a .text and treat it as a number, it's a string. You can use var or cast to change the string to a number the last line of the sub there is no equal sign anywhere.
well that guy on youtube was full of shit then
any monkey can post on youtube.
valid point. ok im gonna took around with some things here. see if i can get it to work. thank you bud. very appriciated
have a look at some sample code. Some good examples are here: https://visualbasic.happycodings.com/forms/code12.html Keep in mind that code needs to be completely accurate. Typos ruin your day.
I would suggest looking into an array of picturebox's that contain and image or not, then you can loop through the controls and look for image = nothing. To speed this up I would also create a dictionary for each card, first key in the pair should be the card number and the second should be the image itself. This way you dont have to data operations when transferring images to the cards. Actually I would create a class of all properties of the cards and load them in from the database on start. Where can I get a copy of the JSON you were going to use? 
Someone on stack overflow recommended this code, what do you think? Also here is the json: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OrV95jukaYF7x1V8fgA12CMpGk8U4CHO](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OrV95jukaYF7x1V8fgA12CMpGk8U4CHO) But I'm gonna stick with access though It's much more understandable for me and I've come a long way with it. Dim cards As List(Of String) = New List(Of String) cards.Add(TextBox1.Text) 'Create a placeholder variable Dim cardPictureBox As PictureBox 'Loop through every selected card URL For Each url As String In Cards 'Create a new PictureBox cardPictureBox = New PictureBox() With { .Size = New Size(100, 100) .SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.CenterImage .WaitOnLoad = False } 'Add the PictureBox to the Form Me.Controls.Add(cardPictureBox) 'Load the image asynchronously cardPictureBox.LoadAsync(url) Next
First things first, do some quick research on With...End With statements. It'll make your code about 100x easier to read. Also, it doesn't hurt to assign worksheets to variables so you can call ws_parsed instead of Worksheets("Parsed Data"). I'm on mobile so I can't test this atm, but I think the issue you're having is a result of the fact that the brackets being used to delimit each category are being repeated. I would recommend having a dummy string variable that gets reset each loop with the string you're trying to parse. As you go through, separating each category, remove that section from the dummy string. That way, when you get to a bracket that's been used before, it's like the code is seeing it for the first time. 
As someone else mentioned, you might do something like Dim parsedData = Worksheets("Parsed Data").Cells So you can then do parsedData(i, 1) Just makes the code more readable, same for inputData That being said, if I were parsing a string I'd probably split it, then assign vars to things using sub strings. I want to note this assumes the data is ALWAYS in this manner and never changes. Dim row = "Name{Major}[StudentID]Department{Semester}[Classification]Credits" Dim sections = row.Split("]") Dim firstCurlyPosition = sections(0).IndexOf("{") Dim secondCurlyPosition = sections(1).IndexOf("{") Dim name = sections(0).Substring(0, firstCurlyPosition) Dim department = sections(1).Substring(0, secondCurlyPosition) Dim firstBracePosition = sections(0).IndexOf("[") Dim secondBracePosition = sections(1).IndexOf("[") Dim studentId = sections(0).Substring(firstBracePosition + 1, sections(0).Length - firstBracePosition - 1) Dim classification = sections(1).Substring(secondBracePosition + 1, sections(1).Length - secondBracePosition - 1) I left off major, semester, and credits so you have to dig in to figure out how this is working. Hope it helps
I agree sticking with access is your best bet at this point. To much invested into the Access to change direction. The above code will loop through the array of cards and create a pciturebox for each car. I think they were more getting at the asnyc load of the cards so you dont have a stop to wait for each card to load from the web than they were trying to store your cards and search etc.
hint: 4 spaces before code lines. been a while since I did VBA in excell, can you add a breakpoint and step through? check each instr() result and the math on it and the resulting mid(), make sure its doing what your expect. using some variables as already suggested may help performance too. I'd also use it for instr() results, you have an `InStr(1, Worksheets("Input Data").Cells(i, 1), "{")` 5 times. I'm also not sure that's what you want, and storing the position will let you use that value as the Start position for the next instr.
So... you want us to do your homework for you? What have you done so far? What exactly do you need help with?
Do you have a question?
Looks like you have a lot of work to do. Better get started.
What do you mean by loop a message box? Like you want to close it if they don't hit ok? Message boxes stop code execution by design. If you're trying to display some sort of message, just design your own form element with a "close" button that just hides it. You can then change the text, close that on a timer, etc.
ok
If you run into problems let me know as I can probably help more! It's just not possible to do (what I think) you were trying to do with a message box. You could also use a label or some other thing to display text for whatever you're trying to accomplish.
yeah like the wait isn't too long at all so it's fine. Thanks for your help though!!!
What are you trying to loop a message box for? There might be a better/easier way to do it
If you’re looping through something and outputting it via message box, the user has to click ok before the next output is shown. You’re better off using a listbox or something.
The behavior you are describing does not fit the MessageBox control. The described behavior would seem to fit a toast notification, an example of which can be found here: [https://www.michaelcrump.net/pop-toast-notification-in-wpf/](https://www.michaelcrump.net/pop-toast-notification-in-wpf/)
I'm assuming the CREATE TABLE is failing due to an invalid data type. That column in Access SQL will either be "TEXT" if it's under 255 characters, or "LONG TEXT" (actually this will be MEMO since it appears you are targeting Access 2007) if it's over 255. &amp;#x200B; References: 1.

This works fine: cmd.CommandText = "CREATE TABLE zzztest (ID COUNTER, \[name\] varchar(250), \[type\] varchar(250), \[desc\] varchar(250), \[race\] varchar(250), \[image\_url\] varchar(100), \[atk\] INTEGER, \[def\] INTEGER, \[level\] INTEGER)" But this doesn't... cmd.CommandText = "CREATE TABLE " &amp; nametxt.Text &amp; " (ID COUNTER, \[name\] varchar(250), \[type\] varchar(250), \[desc\] varchar(250), \[race\] varchar(250), \[image\_url\] varchar(100), \[atk\] INTEGER, \[def\] INTEGER, \[level\] INTEGER)"
either nametxt.Text is returning nothing or the concatenation is causing an unexpected consequence. assign the query to a variable and then put a breakpoint after it so you can see what the query looks like before it's run. Getting a look at the concatenated query will direct you where you need to go.
it's not a null reference, but thanks for the advice we'll see how we go!
Two options : 1) Use a Public Shared Variable (Accessible from anywhere) 2) Add an argument to your ImageHandler Sub : **(Sender As Object, e As EventArgs, ByVal CCount As Integer)**
what error do you receive on the second one?
I want to make a Alert popup on the screen several times, without the program waiting for the user to press OK. &amp;#x200B; I want to do it for... ^(pranking reasons...)
Just a little help (I'm pretty sure you can do it easily with this) : &amp;#x200B; &gt;Function Random(ByVal min As Integer, ByVal max As Integer) As Integer &gt; &gt;Static Rizer As New Random() &gt; &gt;Return [Rizer.Next](https://Rizer.Next)(min, max + 1) &gt; &gt;End Function
so add 3 text boxes and a spin button to a form. When they click the spin button, use the math.rand function to generate a random number 3 times and set each text box. After that check if they all match and if they do, display winner winner chicken dinner
thanks everyone, u guys helped a lot she marked it correct and working
&gt;ByVal CCount As Integer I don't think you can add parameters to an event handler.
Don't create temporary `Random` instances like that, you'll end up with duplicate numbers because the RNG is seeded based on the current time.
Are you doing this through a website or something? Or win forms?
Forms
Can't you just add two panels and put the bg image in one, and then your second image in the other? Sorry I haven't worked in win forms in years.
Yea I just did what I mentioned. Just put one panel and set the bg image, then add another panel over top of it and set the bg image to the other image. https://i.imgur.com/g0AVdGK.png
Sry I’m new to this what’s bg?
Oh no problem! BG usually stands for background. In this case a background image. The panel should have a property called background image that you can just set. https://i.imgur.com/U5Wz9iI.png
Thank you so much
where are you keeping track of your current cards? right now that's a function local variable, it goes away when the function is done. make that form level and you can check its count property any time, no need for another variable. what do you need the count for when clicking a card? you can cast `Sender` as a PictureBox type and have a reference to the card that was clicked. If you want to be able to remove it, consider generating a unique name and setting it the .Name property to make sure you can find it in the controls collection to fully remove it.
debug print the actual sql string, and include the actual error text. otherwise we're just guessing.
google "custom messagebox", you can't do it with the built in one, with a custom one you can do whatever you want. just don't show it modal.
ok
No problem, let me know if you have additional questions. Good luck!
thanks for the advice CharlieMay I've taken a brake now I was getting too caught up in it but I'll see how I go when I return. Thanks again for your help I really appreciate it!!!
no worries I'll test it out when I come back to it (I found I was spending too many hours on it hahahaha), but thanks for your advice though!!!! I believe it was a syntax error though
thanks both of you we'll check out a private field!!!
thanks chrwei, yeah I think we will make the count form level thanks!!!
Can you, before you go, tell us what you were entering into that textbox?
Like make a ton of message boxes? Make a timer, enable it, on every tick: For I = 1 to 500 Messagebox.show("pranked beittchhhh") Next
Card names like "Dark Magician" and "The Light of Redemption"
Long answer anyone? :) &amp;#x200B; There are a few issues here, so lets go through each line of code you have, but first there are a couple of standardized ways of doing things when you're choosing the names of things. Take a look here &amp;#x200B; Dim Win As Boolean Dim WinningPlayer As String &amp;#x200B; According to Microsoft's naming conventions the first letter of each word should be lower case and the rest of the letters of the first word should also be lower case. If you have more than word in the name, the first letter of each subsequent word should be capitalized. This is called "pascal case" &amp;#x200B; The exception is when you're naming a parameter such as \`playerOneScore\` and \`playerTwoScore\` in this line of code. The first letter of the first word should be lower case and the first letter of any other words in the name should be upper case. This is called "camel case" &amp;#x200B; Private Function IsThereAWinner (playerOneScore As Integer, playerTwoScore As Integer) As Boolean &amp;#x200B; Don't worry if you don't fully understand that line of code. The important bits are that the function name is pascal case and the parameter "score" is camel case. As a side note, all the keywords are pascal case, but VB corrects those for you. &amp;#x200B; One other thing is to give the names of your variables a little thought to make them meaningful. When you start writing more complex code, it gets harder to look back at things and recognized which variable is which. So.. &amp;#x200B; \`Wins\` is ok \`loss should really be \`Losses\` so that it has the same plural context as \`Wins\` \`Percentage\` could be ok, but it's a bit vague - \`PercentageOfWins\` would be better as that is what you're actually calculating. Just using \`Percentage\`, could mean anything. &amp;#x200B; So .. getting to your code. &amp;#x200B; Private Sub btnWin\_Click(Sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles [btnWin.Click](https://btnwin.click/) &amp;#x200B; No major problems here other than your btnWin should have a capital B. The best way to rename it is to get into the habit of using the Visual studio rename command. This will rename all the bits of code that refer to that button name. Double click the name to highlight it. Then right click on the highlighted name and click Rename. Edit the name and when you're done, press enter. Voila. &amp;#x200B; Ok next line, I wont mention naming conventions again, I'll just correct then :-) &amp;#x200B; DIM Wins, Loss, PERCENT &amp;#x200B; There is another issue though. When you're defining a variable, you need to let Visual studio know what sort of variable you're defining, whether it's an Integer, a Double, or anything else - For the purposes here, \`wins\` and \`losses\` should be integers - after all you cant have 3.5435 wins. However percentages should really be a Single or Double type because you want to keep the calculation accurate. You can send an integer value to your TextBox later if you want. So what you should end up with is &amp;#x200B; Dim Wins, Losses As Integer Dim PercentageOf Wins As Double &amp;#x200B; OK so far? Next two lines &amp;#x200B; Wins = TxtBoxWins.Text) Losses = TxtBoxLosses.text) &amp;#x200B; The TextBoxes .Text property only EVER contains String values (though there is a little more complexity about strings that are beyond scope here), so you'll need to convert the String values into Integer values. There are a few ways to do this, but personally, I like this because the code is clear. &amp;#x200B; Wins = Integer.Parse(TxtBoxWins.Text) Losses = Integer.Parse(TxtBoxLosses.text) &amp;#x200B; The lines above take the String of characters and try to make a sensible Integer out of them. Thats about it. Depending on your Visual Studio settings, you may not NEED to do this, but it's always good to make it clear in when you're converting or parsing types. Again, for readability and maintenance. &amp;#x200B; Nearly there .. :-) Next line &amp;#x200B; Perecent = (Wins/Loses) \* 100 &amp;#x200B; Again no major issues, just an update of names etc. err and a spelling mistake :-) &amp;#x200B; PercentageOfWins = (Wins / Losses) \* 100 &amp;#x200B; Final line! &amp;#x200B; TextBox3 Str (Percent) &amp;#x200B; This should also have errors as it is simply not valid code. Also the name of \`TextBox3\` isn't consistent with your other textboxes. They both start with "Txt" not "Text" and should be renamed to something like "TxtBoxPercentageOfWins" or anything that relates to what the TextBox is for Anyhow. .. so what you're trying to achieve is to assign the value of "PercentageOfWins" to the .Text property of the textbox. As you'll remember, we've defined "PercentageOfWins" as a \`Double\` type and I said that the \`.Text\` property is a \`String\` type. So, to make your code clearer, its a good idea to show what you're doing .. &amp;#x200B; TxtBoxPercentageOfWins.Text = PercentageOfWins.ToString &amp;#x200B; The .ToString method is nice easy way to convert value types (numbers to you and me) to String types &amp;#x200B; And don't forget to finish with &amp;#x200B; End Sub &amp;#x200B; Hopefully you've picked up a few pointers. Enjoy. Programming can be enjoyable and frustrating all at the same time. But keep at it and PRACTICE! Youl'll get better!
Then my suggestion should fix your issue. Any time you have a space, a keyword (like name, password, etc...) or some other special character in a field or table name, you must surround it with [ ] in Access.
&gt;For I = 1 to 500 Messagebox.show("pranked beittchhhh") Next Well it fails on the [Messagebox.show](https://Messagebox.show) part. it shows "End of statement expected." It also only shows keywords in the menu.
Show us what code you have done.
I think this works https://imgur.com/gallery/AoJGmBv
That’s the code I was able to come up with
So for 3, what I would do is loop through all the GPAs and check for ones that are greater than the average bumping a count each time it finds one. For the last do a search through all the names, and when the name matches print out that information.
Awesome thanks so much for the help! I’ll let you know how it goes!
yeah you are correct CharlieMay that was just to test that I can create a table with a custom name. My goal is to allow users to title their decks (table) the way they want, so this was just testing how to allow users to enter custom titles, which made it possible thanks to your advice and the others' help!!!!
i actually did this one few days ago. i figured it out on my own with some help from people on here and some help from youtube. now the next home work he gave me is a doozy. But i think i have it nailed down. Thank you so much for taking your time to help me out with this. honestly the people here are literally better then the actual teacher of the class. he didnt even know how to create a zip file... im not joking im being very serious. he couldnt do it... i had to show him how. FML
How can I troubleshoot your code if I can't even see it
`Private Sub FormClosing(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs) Handles MyBase.Closing` &amp;#x200B; `For I = 1 To 500` [`Messagebox.show`](https://Messagebox.show)`("pranked beittchhhh")` &amp;#x200B; `Next` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; End Sub
Hey again. I can’t seem to figure three out at all. Any hint on how I can start?
Sorry I can't help with coding for school assignments.
Your way works... but now I have to make it that multiple images have to be layered on
Hehe. Back in the 1980's when our school started one of the first computing classes in the UK, most of us on the class new. More than the teacher which was kinda understandable at the time. It's rather sad that the situation hasn't changed.
I would move your avg declaration to the class scope so you can access it from other subs (like you did your GPA and NameList arrays. Since you've already shown you know how to loop (button2) do the same thing only create a counter variable that you can add 1 to every time GPA(i) is greater than Avg.
I'm not understanding what you're trying to do then?
There is a system.random function you can use where you can pass in a min and a max number, it call .Next and it'll create a random number for you. What you'd want is a form with a label to display the number, and then a radio button for the user to guess high or low. Then a button. When they click the button, you call the random function and see if it's higher or lower, and then check that against what they guessed. If you can get some code going and run into problems, post back on here and people will help you out.
Do you need a picture of the cards to display or just the values? You can use an enumeration to link numerical values to face card names.
I will try. thank you
I need the picture of cards to display.
temp tables in SQL Server are only available for the session that created them. As soon as you hit sqlConn.close() those tables are cleaned up.
Can this be done in Python more easily? I think in the book Automating the boring stuff with Python there is something similar, but I don't remember well
As someone mentioned the temp tables only last the length of the command, so calling close gets rid of them. That's by design. Global ones (##) mean they're visible to all connections on your current account, but they too get dropped when all your open connections finally close. If you truly need a temp table, you have to define an actual table, and then you'd want to prefix it with something obvious like _ or temp_my_table or something. Can you explain a little more what you're trying to do. Don't worry about the technical details, just a general sense of what your data is and what you're trying to do with it. I bet I could help you find a better solution than a temp table.
That's the weird thing though, they aren't. They only get shut down when I do the actual request, not the close. I can do a SELECT INTO ##TEMP throw that at ExecuteSQL which both opens and closes the connection pause the program before it goes into the next request and then go in SQL Server and do Select from ##TEMP and get results.
[removed]
The first thing I would do is get actual pictures of all the cards from the net. Suites are optional but would be a fun addition. I would then import all those pictures into your project and in your project you can create an object array for all those pictures. Either 13 of them or 52. I would put a Picture Box on the form with a Higher and Lower button. On initial load I would either generate a random number between 1 and 13 if using only 13 cards or two random numbers, one between 1 and 13 and one between 1 and 4 if using 52. I would store that number or sequence of number in the picturebox's Tag property and load the appropriate card into the picture box. Then if the higher or lower button is clicked I would call a function to generate a random number (or set of numbers again for suite) with the word "higher"/lower as a string value and, I would compare the results to say if the person won, lost or had a draw then store the count of each state into different labels and finally shove the new random numbers into the tag property and change the picturebox to the new card.
only going to give you a hint, no code. Start by pulling 2 into it's own function that can returns the calculated average. You can then use that returned value as a compare point for what /u/rudeoffenris told you. as some complete asides; Your current setup for 1 will fail if your teacher tries to add a fourth student, trust me when I say he will try to add as many students as he feels is necessary to see if he can make the program crash. Learn to name your buttons, forms, variables, functions early. It hurts my soul to see Button1, Button2, etc and the sooner you learn the sooner you'll have it ingrained in your behavior to do it.
and I'm assuming that if you ran a sp\_who2 first, you'd still see the original session listed in the results. Since ##TEMP is global, it's accessible from the secondary session. Won't get cleaned up until after the table goes out of scope for any session that accesses it. This is the issue you are facing. You can either start a session when you spin up the program and use it by reference, or create actual tables and clean them up as you go. Your current database scopes are cleaning themselves up and your data is going out the window. &amp;#x200B; References: 1.

&gt; You can either start a session when you spin up the program and use it by reference Don't people generally frown upon leaving connections open for the duration of a program though, I was definitely brow beaten about it on numerous occasions. I did consider it though but figured I'd get other input first before going "the bad" way.
You might be able to use a transaction
You may need to elaborate there, only transaction I'm aware of currently is used when you want to make modifications to data but want the ability to roll back in case of fuck up.
I think your better to use a different tool. Save all spreadsheets to folder as csv use notepad ++ and make a macro to delete everything you don’t want and run it against all files then type/cat files into one csv then import There are many ways to skin the cat but vba may be a harder tool to create the one off task. Going forward you want a est way to dump data to the file but this initial man handling it f files is better done in Csv IMO
Typically you wouldn't want to do this, but from what I can tell, you are trying to use SQL Server as a temporary, self-cleaning data cache and the only way you are going to be able to do this is through keeping a connection open. It's not a good practice, but for the question asked it's the only way I can see making your solution work. Personally I think I'd set up a view in SQL you can paginate over and let the UI handle the filtering and sorting.
Yep that’s the one. I would assume a session table exists till the end of the transaction.
hi sir. i know how to code the label to generate the random numbers but i cant figure out how to do it in the picture box to show random pictures. can you please help me? I'm a total noob right now and I'm desperate to learn but i have no source where to learn. :(
Not going to help you with your code unless you show you've made some effort but I will give you hints You don't tell the picture box to show random pictures you tell the picture box to show a specific picture from a list. specifically you want an array of bitmaps. Preferably from pictures you've added to your resource files. As for sources to learn; 1) If you're at the point where you've been given a project to code you should have already been given all the lessons to do the job, maybe review your lessons a bit? 2) Google is your friend, in fact I've already given you two things to google already.
ok sorry about that. ill try my best!
I’ll look into it, thank you. Unfortunately (for this project) I’ll be on vacation for the next week but I’ll work on it when I get back. Is python hard to learn?
Awesome, I can give it a shot when I get back from vacation. I notice people often try the sophisticated method when brute force is often warranted. Mikko need hammer.
You may need to add headings and a comma if no dates/batches are in the files but basically you are trying to strip data to a single file which is an easier text process than writing vba file calls. In the end your likely to just copy and paste data between two sheets using macros in excel rather than vba not because it’s hard but it’s just faster
&gt; I'd set up a view in SQL you can paginate Yeah that was another option but I need to convince my Boss the server won't explode if we upgrade from SQL Server 2008 to at the very least SQL Server 2014 as OFFSET/FETCH was only implemented in 2012... Like I mentioned to /u/andrewsmd87 I'm trying to work within the bounds of what I got until I can push the things I want.
Yea I was more after what you're trying to do. Are you trying to do some sort of paging in sql without offset? If so I can help with that
still looking for some assignments ?
It is not hard to learn. You can check the book online for free and see for yourself if the part about Excel works for you: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ Also the book is one of the recommended books to learn the language https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index
Yeah Paging and Filtering Ordering
Ok, this may not be the most performant, but could you create a view with a row number column added and then pull from the view?
Are you talking about creating/re-creating the view at runtime?
No not at run time. Like creating it in SMSS and just leaving it there to use. I have some legacy vb stuff where that was the only solution I could come up with for similar issues.
I don't see how you could do proper pagination with a static row number though Like sure it will work if the data itself is always static and ordered the same way but the moment the user goes "I want to order by this now" or " I only want to see Food Items" or "I want to search for any product that have AAA Batteries in the description" then your paging is screwed. Unless there's a way I can both generate and filter by a row number at runtime which I haven't figured out... I know you can't use ROW_Number() in a where clause and you can't use an alias name in the where clause either.
Ah shit you're right. Honestly you may be stuck with just creating a permenant table to handle it, that you delete and insert data into. I actually had to do something similar years ago. Whats the rough number of rows in the table?
The index of the item you are trying to add already exists in your collection. In others words in your collection you have; * (Index 0) Object1 * (Index 1) Object2 * (index 2) Object3 and now you are trying to add Object 4 with an index of 0,1 or 2 so something in your loop is reusing index numbers (more than one for loop maybe?) Are you putting multiple object types in your collection? Are these objects generated at runtime or are they already on the form? Can you post the whole code that builds your collection?
Between 120 000 and 300 000 depending on some predetermined filtering Options.
Are they like exporting this data or something? We have some tools for data sets that large that need exported. But from a UI perspective, we made the decision a long time ago that getting say 10,000 records back isn't really useful to anyone short of if you're doing automated bulk things with the data. Due to that, like on our search where you could technically get 100s of 1000s of records back we just do a top 500 and display a message saying, we're only showing the first 500 records, you may want to refine your search.
I can't post the code since it's closed source, sadly. The controls are placed and added to the collection at design time (I'm writing a replacement for the SSTAB user control, because our in-house ERP system still looks like the 90s, and nobody can agree on even beginning to think of a successor) &amp;#x200B; Does that mean that if I gave a different index to my controls, the error wouldn't occur? The collection seemed to function as a relatively simple list of pointers to controls so I thought the collection indexes wouldn't interfere with control indexes...
No, it's a purchase order system. Think Amazon but for a retail chain. We have about 300 000 products the stores can buy to stock their shelves from across hundreds of suppliers. The likelyhood they will actually look at 1240 pages worth of stuff is low but Depending on what they are looking to do we need to start big and allow them to focus down and back up afterwards. So the process will usually go; Show me everything. I know these suppliers don't have warehouses nearby so don't show me those. Now show me the Housewares department. Now order them by cost. Now show me lightbulbs, I want these, these and these. Undo the search, now show me Toilet Plungers. ... Ok now I'm done with housewares, show me Electronics. Then when they are done they hit a button and it will give them options on what to do with the batch of products they've selected based on each individual supplier involved.
What version of VB are we dealing with here by the way? I don't see how a portion of code that adds stuff to a collection would not be shareable but whatever, can you at least show me the debug print you tried to do (without obfuscation I mean)
We're still on VB6 SP6. If it's just the code for adding to the collection, it's the same code as in the post, but with different variable names, and an additional type that contains the collection. Simply replacing the add line by a debug.print parent.controls(nameOfControl)(indexOfControl) also doesn't work. For information, the name and index are read from a propBag, as this happens during ReadProperties. I'm also off for the weekend so don't worry about time!
&gt; debug.print parent.controls(nameOfControl)(indexOfControl).Name for example, also doesn't work. See this is why I hate dealing with people a lot of the time, if you obfuscate or hide your code, how are people supposed to tell you what part of your code is goddamn wrong? You are NOT using parent.controls(nameOfControl)indexOfControl) because that does not exist in VB6. Also as a complete aside, Parent.controls... Parent of WHAT because Parent by itself is not a thing I just tried it and VB6 asked me to define the variable Parent so unless unless you've created an array of objects called Parent it is ControlName(index[and only if it's an array of controls).Parent.Controls So unless you have something somewhere that goes; Dim Parent as Object Set Parent = NameOfControl.Parent then your obfuscated code is all wrong. That's what showing your code does helps determine where you fucked up. Just because line of code 31 is the one crashing doesn't mean the issue isn't at line 4 Also closed source means nothing if your code doesn't work and you can always delete the code from your post once the issue is fixed. Don't have to post the entire program just the section that involves the thing you're trying to do Anyway from what I understand you're making a replacement for a Tab Control and trying to get all the controls a user has put into each tab right? It this code in the Tab Control or the form? Anyway since you won't post your actual mistake If this code that isn't working is in the Tab Control you've created why not go Dim ctrl As Control For Each ctrl In Controls mycol.add ctrl Next ctrl You'll probably have to do TypeOf checks for containers and make it somewhat recursive in case they go all Russian doll. Anyway lot of what you're describing doesn't make sense; Why would a tab control need access to the properties of the items it contains? The way your collection.add is written makes it look like you're always adding the parent of something to the collection rather than the thing itself. You're reading the name and index from a propbag... of what the tab control? the objects being added to it? If it's the controls being placed into your tab control then why are you not adding them to the collection during the ReadProperties instead of storing them as a and index and using it later. Hell for all we know maybe your read properties is what's wrong. Anyway hopefully you get what I am saying and if not I wish you luck with "why is this one line of obfuscated code in a sea of code you can't see not working?"
[Here's a dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssbhvworehrrdze/Demo.zip) to two projects that I recreated to demonstrate my issue. Simply open the form in design mode to see what I mean. One works (non-indexed) and one doesn't (indexed). There's no fluff and nothing to distract from the issue. Thank you for your time by the way!
just want to check something the index you are using, is it because you are going to have an array of Command1 (or whatever control) Because if you make an array of Command1 and add it to your collection using method A it adds the entire array which then becomes accessible through mycol.item(indexgeneratedonthe mycoll.add)(indexofthecontrolitself)
Here's the deal, I need to keep track of which control will be in which tab, so I need to store control association in the parent form when it is closed, and in some sort of data structure while in design mode and while running and I need it all to carry over, so during design time, I check which controls are visible on the active tab and store that informartion. When the tab is switched, the current tab controls get also moved out of the way just like in SSTab and the new active tab is checking for visible controls. My tabs already handle non indexed controls just fine but indexed controls are being problematic, and I need those as well, so I but replicating the error gave me a hint on how to solve the issue: the error doesn't occur when inside a timer, so I'll probably store the propbag info somewhere and do the initial association shortly after that.
You cant compile a vb application as stand alone. you will have to build and installer and include all libraries required to run the application. I have heard this is now possible in net core 2 but I am not done it yet.
Ok thanks, I just made an installer so it’s now working
You have to include all extra files as resources. Then when you build the EXE, they're bundled with it. Then you can do stuff like this. pbLogo.Image = My.Resources.CompanyLogo.png
If you’re using Visual Studio, I know you could get the NuGet package called ILMerge. I use that to combine the file into one .exe.
Unfortunately the compile options don't allow for MSVBVM5 or 6 (or VBRUN100-400 if an older version) to go missing, but the runtimes are common enough
You can create an installer... there are third party tools, and also can be created in visual studio. I havent had to do it in years, as my coding is for internal work users and we have a unique distribution method. Take a look at this: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects
I imagine he's more likely talking about dlls like the vs power pack DLL, it'll end up in the debug/release folder with the compiled exe
You could hang outside the Microsoft campus as they lay off the VB dev team.... Seriously though you could try https://www.freelancer.com/
Thanks - I’ll give that a try
Out of the loop. Is it officially being discontinued? I use visual studio occasionally and have noticed that the vb examples have been stripped out of the online docs
No, not discontinued, but it went from being its own .NET language to being developed along side the C# team with feature parity, to being relegated to the "C# will get features and maybe, just maybe VB might see them if we feel like implementing them in the language". Over the years it has just become an after thought within MS, but it still survives because there is so much legacy code written out there in VB and VBA.
You might want to try this in the /r/vba subreddit too.
This screenshot is of my code that simply generated the pressure ranges from 10 to 100. (I know my variables are unitless, but the units aren't relevant to what I am trying to figure out right now) &amp;#x200B; Now all I want to do is write a 'for loop' or 'while loop' code (whichever one is more relevant in this scenario) that will multiply the single Temperature value by each of the Pressure values and return each result next to the designated pressure value. I believe the screenshot will help describe this. &amp;#x200B; My ultimate goal is to write one solid code that returns the pressures from 10-100 (has specified end number, which is 100) as well as returning the temperature\*pressure values (which will only end when the pressure values end) &amp;#x200B; I hope I have conveyed my goal well enough and would appreciate any and all help.
I'm sorry if I'm not understanding your goal, but shouldn't you assign a value to x in the second loop? Otherwhise T * x (x=0) will always be 0? I think you can achieve both your goals with just one For loop. Not sure tho. I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.
It looks like your first for loop is unnecessary, does it just enter 10, 20, 30, etc into ten cells? Is there a reason you do it this way instead of just entering the values in the spreadsheet? On your second for loop, what value does x start with? Since it's assigned a value in the other loop I wonder if it's still undefined when you get to the second loop. Also I don't see that you ever define tp. Realistically, using VBA to accomplish this seems overly complex. In cell D3 type this in: =$B$3*C3 then click and drag it down. Does that get you the result you're looking for?
Your description is a little bit confusing, but this is what I'm getting from it: You want your function to input in the range of D3 to D12 (your green cells) the multiplication of B3 times the neighbor cell to the left of your green cells. Is this your desired output? &amp;#x200B; |T|P|T\*P| |:-|:-|:-| |25|10|250| ||20|500| ||30|750| ||40|1000| ||50|1250| ||60|1500| ||70|1750| ||80|2000| ||90|2250| ||100|2500| If that is the case, I don't see why you need a macro. You can instead use an Excel formula in your high lighted cells in the form of `=B$3 * C3`, then you just use the auto fill option. Notice the the '$' (dollar sign) before the number 3. This instructs Excel to NOT auto increase that cell when you auto-fill. Additionally, if you need your data to be raw in the cells (i.e. not a formula), select your cells and copy and paste in the exact same location as values. To do that when you right click you will see a clipboard with "123" written on it. &amp;#x200B; Now about your original question, I have a couple of issues with what you said. You say you want a "solid code," but in all honesty this seems like a workaround to something Excel can already do. If you really want something solid that does what you say, you will have to add to your sub-procedure parameters, some constants, error checks (for dealing with bad input), and more meaning full names for your identifiers (variables, functions, etc.). However, those are just suggestions because I'm assuming you just started learning this. Don't try to put too much stuff right now. Try to do little things the right way. What does the right way means? It means that nothing can break your code and that your code does what you need with flexibility to accommodate for all meaning full use cases (for example here if I needed the output somewhere else I'd have to rewrite all the code). So this is the simplest example that does exactly what you asked for: Option Explicit Public Sub GenerateDataset() 'generic iterative variable Dim i As Long 'variable for the temperature Dim temperature As Long 'temporary variable for the pressure 'it's gonna be used in the loop Dim pressure As Long 'gets temperature from the designated cell temperature = Cells(3, 2).Value2 For i = 0 To 9 'gets pressure for the current iteration pressure = (i + 1) * 10 'assigns pressure to designated cell Cells(i + 3, 3).Value2 = pressure 'multiplies pressure by temperature and assigns to designated cell Cells(i + 3, 4).Value2 = pressure * temperature Next End Sub Lastly, one clarification about the code. Always prefer the property "Value2" over "Value" as there are some issues with data-types when you use the former.
What version of .Net are you using to develop your app? Windows Server 2008 is awfully old. I'm thinking you may be using a version of .Net that's incompatible.
Damn, that’s harsh.
Depending on the scope of your project, I’m available. I know both VB and C# very well.
If you have an alpha channel then you need to set the alpha on the control. By default, controls use RGB, but you can use ARGB. So just set it’s backcolor to 0,0,0,0. And if the control, like forms, offer an alpha setting, crank it to 0.
Use a variable with its access modifier set to “public shared”, not recommended as the whole application has access, you want to keep things encapsulated. Or just define a private variable outside of both subs. Just stick it at the top of your class. In C# we can make things static, which for variables makes it global and can also affect garbage collection. Public shared I believe is almost the same principle, you have access to it without initializing a new instance of an object. I would recommend researching the object oriented design paradigm, and it’s concepts, such as encapsulation. Design patterns are also very nice too.
I would suggest a better method would be to use [psexec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) that is available in the sysinternals quite. psexec \\machine -u user -p password -i -w "C:\application" myapp.exe This tool allows you to execute remote applications via RPC from your local workstation.
YOU LEGEND. Slimrunner, thank you very much for taking your time to help me learn more about VBA, I really do appreciate it and you have no idea how helpful your annotations are. My ultimate goal is to create a Loop within a loop that returns the T*P values for 3 different temps. I know I could write the formulas in the cells but learning VBA is a personal goal. So essentially I want the temperature loop (lets call it Tloop) to start at 25 and go to 125, in increments of 25. Then inside that loop is another loop for pressure (lets call it Ploop) that will spit out the previously described pressure ranges(10-100, in increments of 10) and multiply the previously described temperature by each pressure value in its designated column. I realize this is very abstract to picture and I apologize if it is too confusing. I wish I could attach a screenshot of my excel worksheet to better convey what I am trying to describe. Either way, if you would be able to demonstrate how the sub Ploop within the Tloop would be written, I would appreciate it TREMENDOUSLY. If there is a way for me to send a screenshot and you'd like to see it, I would happily oblige. Thank you once again for your time.
Yeah that would work very well and I am familiar with several excel formulas but I am trying to learn VBA and I'm approaching it with the easiest of codes then progressing to more complex stuff.
This is what I came up with based off the above code you donated, but of course I'm getting error messages Public Sub GenerateDataset() 'generic iterative variable for temperature Dim t As Long 'generic iterative variable for pressure Dim p As Long 'variable for the temperature Dim temperature As Long &amp;#x200B; 'temporary variable for the pressure 'it's gonna be used in the loop Dim pressure As Long For t = 25 To 125 'gets temperature for current iteration temperature = i + 25 'assigns temperature to designated cell Cells(t + 3, 3).Value2 = temperature For p = 0 To 9 'gets pressure for the current iteration pressure = (p + 1) \* 10 'assigns pressure to designated cell Cells(p + 3, 3).Value2 = pressure 'multiplies pressure by temperature and assigns to designated cell Cells(p + 3, 4).Value2 = pressure \* temperature Next Next End Sub
Cool - here is the job posting, I can fill you in more if you are interested. https://blinkux.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jn1r/
I would like to know what I’m working on before going through an application process. It should be the first thing you mention instead of a link to an application.
Check out String.ToCharArray() That should do exactly what you want.
I'm gonna give you some terminology and tips before we get into the code again. When two loops are **nested** they are referred to as **outer loop** and **inner loop**. The outer loop is the one outside, and the inner is, likewise, the one inside. Each repetition of a loop is called **iteration**. By convention in the programming world is recommended to use indentation for clarity. Whatever is inside loops or conditionals (If and Select) must be indented one level. Each nesting level adds one extra indentation. Get used to use tab for indentation, not space. Now let's get to the juicy part. Given the code: 01 Public Sub GenerateDataset() 02 'generic iterative variable for temperature 03 Dim t As Long 04 'generic iterative variable for pressure 05 Dim p As Long 06 'variable for the temperature 07 Dim temperature As Long 08 'temporary variable for the pressure 09 'it's gonna be used in the loop 10 Dim pressure As Long 11 12 For t = 25 To 125 13 'gets temperature for current iteration 14 temperature = i + 25 15 16 'assigns temperature to designated cell 17 Cells(t + 3, 3).Value2 = temperature 18 19 For p = 0 To 9 20 'gets pressure for the current iteration 21 pressure = (p + 1) * 10 22 'assigns pressure to designated cell 23 Cells(p + 3, 3).Value2 = pressure 24 'multiplies pressure by temperature and assigns to designated cell 25 Cells(p + 3, 4).Value2 = pressure * temperature 26 Next 27 Next 28 End Sub First error is in **line 12**. This is a logic error, you told me in the previous reply that you want to go in increments of 25 but you forgot to add the `step` for your outer loop. &amp;#x200B; There is also an error in the **line 14**. You never declared the variable "i". I didn't say this in my first comment and added the code, but I highly recommend adding at the very top of all your modules `Option Explicit`. That line instructs the compiler to throw an error whenever it detects that you did NOT declared a variable. This is very useful to catch tricky errors. Besides, as a programmer you have to get used to be aware of your variables and try to start using more meaningful names too. &amp;#x200B; Another thing to notice is that you overriding your own data in **line 17**. Notice that you are putting that data in the same column where the pressure is supposed to go, the third one. The function **Cells** works like this `Cells(ROW, COLUMN)`. Remember that both parameters are 1-based so that means that the first cell in the top-left corner is referred to by calling the code `Cells(1,1)`. You want that data in row 2. &amp;#x200B; Finally, and I'm assuming you want your output to be stacked one on top of each other, you would have to add up all your iterating variables in the ROW parameter of **lines 23 and 25**. If you notice, every time you repeat the outer loop you will continually be overriding what you do in the inner loop. In order to do this you have to come up with a way to get multiples of 10 every iteration of the outer loop. Why 10? That is the span of your tables. &amp;#x200B; You should be able to come up with a fix to your code with this information, but I'm just gonna give you a hint on the math for the previous paragraph. Your outer loop goes from 25 to 125 in increments of 25. So in order to get that number to be 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on and so forth you need to create a variable that holds that **offset.** The offset will simply be `(t * 25 - 1) * 10`. You could also do `t * 2.5`, but that would make your tables start in the row 25. &amp;#x200B; I want you this time to come up with the solution as great part of being a programmer is to troubleshoot your code, or others' code.
Hm, I'm really new to programming so it's probably a really obvious mistake but I can't seem to get it to work. This is my code: Dim lines() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("Employees.txt") Dim n As Integer = lines.Count - 1 ReDim employees(n) Dim array() As String Dim x As String &amp;#x200B; For i As Integer = 0 To n array = lines(i).Split(","(0)) x = array.ToString() x = x.ToCharArray() lstDisplay.Items.Add(x) Next &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; What it's doing is it's reading the text file for each iteration and then separating each line based on the commas. (For example the first line is Washington,George,1234). So I got that part down, now I try to convert the variable array into a string and store it into x. I then try to convert x into a character array. When I spit it out in a listbox all that comes up is System.String\[\]. Any ideas?
Figured it out, check comment
 Dim line() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("Employees.txt") Dim linedata() As String Dim j As Integer = line.Count - 1 Dim length As Integer Dim convert_linedata Dim newCharArray For i As Integer = 0 To j linedata = line(i).Split(",") convert_linedata = linedata(0).ToString newCharArray = convert_linedata.ToCharArray() length = linedata(0).Count - 1 For k As Integer = 0 To length lstDisplay.Items.Add(newCharArray(k)) Next It produces this: [https://imgur.com/a/qfZ7JOV](https://imgur.com/a/qfZ7JOV)
Way too much wiggling in that code. Dim sLines() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("Employees.txt") redim employees(sLines.count - 1) Dim sWords() as String Dim sWord as String For each sLine as String in sLines sWords() = sLine.Split(","(0)) For each sWord in sWords lstDisplay.Items.Addrange(sWord.ToCharArray()) Next next I don't really understand why you want to add each individual letter of a text document to a listbox as individual items though...
You might need to look into a background worker to run the loadCards() function and pass back to the form's controls with delegates as needed. [Here's a small tutorial that might help](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/88605-the-background-worker/)
Well I'm 100% going about this the wrong way but as part of a hw assignment I have a keypad. The keypad is associated with letters ie 1 = ABC 2= DEF. When you enter the first 3 letters in the last name and first letter of the first name of a person in the text file it will bring up their name and extension. Ie I'll input 8163 and george Washington: extension 2000 will come up. But the only way I could think of associating 8163 to george Washington would be to make an if statement(and the consequently 35 other elseif statements for this giant text file.) So the only other way I can think of is taking the first 3 characters in their last name and first character in their first name and putting it into a chat array and associating each character with a numeric value. Ie: "A" "B" "C" = "1" etc. I'm fully aware I'm way overcomplicatimg this but I cant really think of any other way to do it with my limited experience.
&gt;I'm fully aware I'm way over complicating Ok, so lets break it down into it's component parts. Since this is homework I won't give more code for now but if you post what you come up with after reading this then we can see if improvements can be made. First you have your Dial Codes; ABC=1,DEF=2,GHI=3,JKL=4,MNO=5,PQK=6,STU=7,VWX=8,YZ=9 Then You have your people Washington,George,1234 If we assume the file will always have the same format we can take my previous code take out the for each after the split because we don't need it and use our assumption to access the different parts as we need. In the code I detailed base on the assumption that the file is always the same format; sWords(0) is always going to be Last Name sWords(1) is always going to be First Name sWords(2) is always going to be the extension. What can we do with this info. Well we know we need the first 3 letters of Last Name and the First Letter of First name. and we need to figure out what their number means. what we can do is grab the necessary sub strings of the two pieces we need, turn it into a string and toss it at a function that takes a string and returns a string That function would then loop through the 4 character string and have a case statement that checks which Dial code the letter fits in. It's entirely possibly to have AND/OR operators in a case statement (as an FYI) After the loop you return the string of numbers you built Finally you shove the number you got, the First Name, The Last Name and the extension in to a 4 by X array.
Wew that is a lot to digest, I'll try my hand at it tonight and get back at you. Thanks so much for the detailed response!
Once again, thank you very much. I appreciate every bit of detail and all the clarifications. Most of all I appreciate the fact that a complete stranger has put so much effort in to helping another complete stranger. Kind of helps restore my faith in humanity a little bit. I agree with you and thank you for not giving me the explicit code, because I wouldn't learn as well that way. Learning by immersion is the best way to learn and experience is the best teacher. I will take all your help and tips and advice and apply it and will get my code to do what I want. I will message you when I have completed it and it is running correctly. The only assumption that is incorrect is that I actually want my data to go across. So at temperature 25C and all 10 different pressures I get the Temp*pressure values in columns A,B,C, respectively. For (the next iteration, I believe my terminology is correct) temperature 50C and all 10 different pressures I get Temp*pressure values in columns D,E,F, respectively. So all in all, I will have 5 sets of data spanning 15 columns and all just 10 rows except for the temperature which will just be one cell. I am an engineering student and this code is only to learn how to do what is described above so I can apply that knowledge to my actual project with much more complicated formulas, but if I know how to code these simple formulas I can apply it to the project. In the end the user will enter data and click a button that activates the code (or Sub) and returns the results in the format that I described above (the 5 sets of data consisting of 2 parameters and their repective results, so 15 columns spanning 10 rows). Anyway, thank you again, you are awesome and I greatly appreciate everything. Will message you when I have it completed and operating successfully.
Thanks, took some doing to get the delegates working and *generic* enough but that seems to have fixed both issues.
I'm developing on .Net 2.0. I can launch the application perfectly fine from the server via Remote Desktop but via the Telnet session, no dice.
The only way I have been able to do this without a URL requires the use of the UIAutomation Library and the Windows sdk tool called inspect.exe.
That would be okay if I we're always directly connected to the network, however, the application will be running from outside the network via Telnet as a console to access some minor information.
Thank you! I will read up on both of these things. Unfortunately I don’t have access to the URL from home so will have to wait until Tuesday to make additional attempts. I’ll try to let you know how it goes if I can find a solution.
You very likely can do this with httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse objects without the need to ever invoke an actual instance of a browser.
use IE's network inspector to find the url and post/get format it expects, then generate the post yourself and get the file directly.
The file being downloaded changes based on the information being input into text boxes. I need to access the browser to input the filter. I’m not sure if I would be able to accomplish this through and httpwebrequest (I’m very new to this stuff so it’s very possible that I’m wrong).
I’ve already tried this, no URL to be found. I believe what happens when the button is pressed is filters are applied to data and a CSV file is created for the user with the filters entered. I’ve been able to download files using the method you described from other websites but this is a different kind of beast.
Got it. I have no experience with Telnet. Looks like you have to make a separate connection in your code to use Telnet. I found [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8) if you haven't already stumbled across it. I also found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9113632/test-telnet-communication-on-remote-computer-using-vb-net) in the hobgoblins' lair.
look for a "data:text/csv" in the code, if your lucky you can get the csv data via InvokeScript and window.external bindings, skipping the download prompt, and writing the file directly where you want without trusting the user to pick the right folder. FWIW, I've done similar in C#, but the process should be the same in vb.net
I have the Telnet server live, that's not the issue, as Windows Server handles that perfectly fine. I can log in perfectly fine and access the CLI: &amp;#x200B; However, if I try to run my application, I get this: However, I can run other CLI based applications (like VIM for Windows) fine.
Technically it is possible, because everything that the browser does eventually has to be turned into a web request. Now whether or not it's feasible is another question. What you are doing is probably a lot less work.
Option 1: Press F12 to open the "Developer Tools" menu in the web browser of your choice. There is always a network profiler tab. Option 2:Use Fiddler. This will monitor all of the network traffic on your computer and tell you exactly what's going on. There have been times in my career where this is literally the only way I was able to do my job. https://www.telerik.com/fiddler
I think I recall seeing data:text/csv somewhere when I was scrubbing through. Thank you so much for all the assistance. I’m going to look into all of this and bring my notes to work on Tuesday.
I’m restricted to only using Option 1, external applications rarely get approved for use on my network at work - also, I doubt that my request would be approved as this isn’t actually part of my job description. I’ve just been asked if I could potentially figure out a way to accomplish this.
I just done a few more bits of research on the error and discovered something. As there's no Windows console between the application and the user (as Telnet isn't a Windows console), there is no way to call Console commands. Makes sense I guess, but it's stupid as all heck. However, apparently I can go with Standard IO Handles (STDIN and STDOUT) to do what I want (somewhat). Time to learn something new!
That’s what I thought. Just having a hard time finding any information about this. Thank you so much for the help.
HttpWebRequests and HttpWebResponse objects bypass all of that. You craft a web request with the post data that needs to be passed back to the server (the form data that you fill out and then click the button to download the file). The HttpWebResponse is what gets returned from executing that request. It will just be the raw HTML returned that the browser would normally render into a visible page. So you can parse the HTML, get the URL of the file to download, and then download it in code. Or if the file is automatically served up and no URL is ever provided (even just within the code), then the HttpWebResponse can actually be an array of bytes of the actual file you want to download. There is no doubt it would accomplish what you want, but it does take some knowledge of how HTML and web servers work (headers, etc) to get it working correctly. Good thing is that there are lots of examples using these objects around the web. Not trying to send you off in a completely different direction, but trying to automate another programs UI is almost always a bad idea and will likely break or not work the same on all machines depending on their configuration.
One thing I see is that you declare digit as Char which would be an issue if a 2 digit number is entered. Pretty sure it would only take on digit and therefore not show a 0-9 error. Try changing your For Each to For Each digit as String in strDigits and see if that is any better. Also, you might want to reset the `lblMessageMain.Text = ""` right after that line so that if they fix the issue, the last error isn't still displayed upon success.
Thank you for the quick response; trying it now!
It worked! Thank you!
If you want to play around with this, I wrote something similar a while back and decided to find it and play around with it to see if I could adapt it to your rule of 9 single digits separated by comma. Just drop this into your class and in the Keypress event of the textbox put e.Handled = SingleDigitComma(sender, e.KeyChar) and the function is as follows: Public Function SingleDigitComma(ByVal sender As Object, eChar As Char) As Boolean 'cast the sender back into a textbox Dim tb As TextBox = DirectCast(sender, TextBox) 'don't let us type more than the 9 digits and commas If tb.TextLength = 17 AndAlso eChar &lt;&gt; vbBack Then Return True End If 'create a string of the only characters allowed in the textbox Dim charsAllowed As String If tb.TextLength = 0 Then charsAllowed = "0123456789" Else charsAllowed = ",0123456789" End If 'start enforcing the rules, (can't start with comma, can't have 2 digits) If charsAllowed.IndexOf(eChar) &gt; -1 OrElse eChar = vbBack Then If eChar = "," Then If eChar = tb.Text.Substring(tb.TextLength - 1, 1) Then Return True Else Return False End If End If If IsNumeric(eChar) AndAlso tb.TextLength &gt; 0 Then If IsNumeric(eChar) And IsNumeric(tb.Text.Substring(tb.TextLength - 1, 1)) Then Return True End If End If Return False End If Return True End Function This should only allow the user a single digit separated by a comma 9 times. The only check you would need to make is to ensure that all 9 digits were entered before continuing. In other words, if the length of the text is not 17, the user has not entered enough digits.
Nice! I hope it works for you.
This seems like something you should be able to do way easier with regular expressions.
This is for an assignment so I don’t have much leeway, unfortunately
You can do this with one for loop and a character array. It will be faster and more readable than regex. Not that speed matters at all in this example

Make an loop to go through the array, If statement to check if memberData(i).distance great than 7, if greater then save Console.writeline ("true at array position: " + i) Hopefully that helps

Paste your SQL into a MySQL workbench query window and make sure that it is actually working there.
So, on the first For Each, this is the statement: SET @daycount=(SELECT COUNT(*) AS daycount FROM childattendance WHERE cid='1'); SET @billingrate = (SELECT billingrate FROM childdb WHERE cid='1'); INSERT INTO invoicepaid (cid, invoiceid, invoiceamount, invoicetax, invoicetotals) VALUES ('1', '1', @daycount*@billingrate, (@daycount*@billingrate)*0.15, (@daycount*@billingrate)*1.15); When ran in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET), I get that error attached, however, when I run it in my administrative environment (using phpMyAdmin), I get this:
It's not MY homework dude so it's not like I'm in a rush. :P I got plenty of code of my own (and of past shitty devs) to deal with so by all means take your time.
With a network scanner I could find them in &lt; 2 mins.
that error makes me think the MySqlCommand method is taking the @ as a query parameterization marker. maybe it needs escaped? I don't use mysql, so I'm not sure what it needs for escaping.
I was thinking that too, but according to the documentation on MySQL site, it should work: mysql&gt; SET @c = "c1"; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql&gt; SET @s = CONCAT("SELECT ", @c, " FROM t"); Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql&gt; PREPARE stmt FROM @s; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec) Statement prepared mysql&gt; EXECUTE stmt; +----+ | c1 | +----+ | 0 | +----+ | 1 | +----+ 2 rows in set (0.00 sec) mysql&gt; DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
that's fine for mysql SQL syntax. I'm talking about MySqlClient.MySqlCommand syntax. it's not the same.
Not within Visual Studio. The language itself is not case sensitive, so it would still compile if you were to say, writing VB code in notepad and then run it through the VB compiler manually. What is the point anyway? Why does it matter that keywords are cased?
Haha the hw is already more than a week late and my professor literally just wants us to code a giant 44 long ifelse statement to correlate the numbers to the people... so I'm trying to do it the hard but rewarding way but I lack the motivation to do it...such is life

Give it that nice C# feel. 😂
what happens if you wrap them like you would a table name that is a keyword or contains a space? I'm not sure of the syntax in mySql. But a quick search seem to lead to the ` (above the tilde key). Maybe try: Dim selectStatementD As String = "SET `@daycount`=(SELECT COUNT(*) AS daycount FROM childattendance WHERE cid='" &amp; invoiceNumber.childID &amp; "'); SET `@billingrate` = (SELECT billingrate FROM childdb WHERE cid='" &amp; invoiceNumber.childID &amp; "'); INSERT INTO invoicepaid (cid, invoiceid, invoiceamount, invoicetax, invoicetotals) VALUES ('" &amp; invoiceNumber.childID &amp; "', '" &amp; invoiceNumber.invoiceID &amp; "', `@daycount`*`@billingrate`, (`@daycount`*`@billingrate`)*0.15, (`@daycount`*`@billingrate`)*1.15);" I'm not sure but I would think this would tell the parser to treat these as literal text and not parameters. And while we're on the subject of parameters... they are always a safer way to create sql statements.
But objects are case sensitive I believe. The coding conventions are that local variables should be camel case everything else should be pascal I think. What would happen if you had an enum and a class property of the same name name? Not a good idea.

More like a nice programming language, less advertising, less book title feel.
Then learn C#. What you’re looking for is not possible and even if it were, it’s not going to make you a better programmer. Also having everything lower case is a terrible idea because now you can’t tell what’s part of .NET libraries, or your own code, lets also not forget about backing fields. Having everything lowercase is a terrible option and destroys the readability of any language.
How are you doing the data access? SQL strings? Datasets? Linq2sql? Entity framework?
Load the query into a datagridview Retrieve value from DGV Label.text = storedValueFromDGV
yeah, that sounds like a pretty easy task, take whatever your SUM is then just do like textbox1.text = your sum value, put that at the end of anywhere your math is to update the value
Yes, if the query returns a single sum result, you can use executeScalar() to store it to an int variable. sql = "SELECT Sum(Quantity) FROM theTable WHERE ItemID = 1" ... code to build the command and pass the sql and connection Then Dim result as Integer = CInt(yourCommand.ExecuteScalar()) result will now hold the value from the aggregate.
or if you're working for a single customer/location you can host the .exe and all resources on a public network drive and distribute shortcuts to the app instead.
Hm. So I finally got it to work where it converts numbers to letters but I'm having trouble putting the converted variable into the array. It says that I can't put a string into an array. Any ideas?
post your code, including the parts that converts and the part that calls it
 Private Sub btnLookup_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnTest.Click Dim line() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("Employees.txt") Dim line_data() As String Dim lastname_substring_1 As String Dim lastname_substring_2 As String Dim lastname_substring_3 As String Dim firstname_substring As String Dim new_array() As String Dim namecode As String Dim converted_name_to_numbercode As String Dim n As Integer = line.Count - 1 ReDim employees(n) For i As Integer = 0 To n line_data = line(i).Split(",") namecode = line_data(0).Substring(0, 3) + line_data(1).Substring(0, 1) lastname_substring_1 = namecode.Substring(0, 1) lastname_substring_2 = namecode.Substring(1, 1) lastname_substring_3 = namecode.Substring(2, 1) firstname_substring = namecode.Substring(3, 1) converted_name_to_numbercode = convert_to_code(lastname_substring_1) converted_name_to_numbercode += convert_to_code(lastname_substring_2) converted_name_to_numbercode += convert_to_code(lastname_substring_3) converted_name_to_numbercode += convert_to_code(firstname_substring) new_array = converted_name_to_numbercode ------------------------------ Function convert_to_code(ByRef x As String) As String Select Case x.Substring(0, 1) Case Is = "A", "a", "B", "b", "C", "c" Return "2" Case Is = "D", "d", "E", "e", "F", "f" Return "3" Case Is = "G", "g", "H", "h", "I", "i" Return "4" Case Is = "J", "j", "K", "k", "L", "l" Return "5" Case Is = "M", "m", "N", "n", "O", "o" Return "6" Case Is = "P", "p", "Q", "q", "R", "r", "S", "s" Return "7" Case Is = "T", "t", "U", "u", "V", "v" Return "8" Case Is = "W", "w", "X", "x", "Y", "y", "Z", "z" Return "9" Case Else Return "Not found." End Select End Function
Not exactly how I would have done it, you're still overthinking quite a bit but that will come with experience. For now look at your New_Array variable in both declaration and when you try to fill it and tell me what you think is missing there. Also go back to the tasks I listed and ponder how you're going to link the numbers you shove in that array with your employee list if you have two separate arrays
Well my thinking is that if I can make a new array and shove the converted\_name\_to\_numbercode value into it, I can then merge array1 in with array2 and have a simple if statement If converted\_name\_to\_numbercode = MergedArray(4) Then print something End if
But why though, when it's entirely possible to make multi dimensional arrays?
well I got it to work by cheesing it(let's just leave it at that because even to me the way I got newarray to put in the values of converted\_number\_to\_numbercode is unholy) but I'm confused about the advantages of a multidimensional array in this situation. My professor didn't go over multidimensional arrays aside from just telling us how to initialize them. Wouldn't just a regular array with 4 rows (lastname,firstname,extension,numbercode) suffice for this? Why would a multidimensional array be more efficient?
 you have 4 values, but you have have how many employees? That's what a multi dimentional array is about if you do; Dim Employees(lines.count)(4) You now have an array that can contain all the (lastname,firstname,extension,numbercode) in your file. Employees(0)(0) is Washington Employees(0)(1) is George Employees(0)(2) is Extension 1234 Employees(0)(3) is Numbercode for WasG Employees(1)(0) is Robert Employees(1)(1) is Bob Employees(1)(2) is Extension 1235 Employees(1)(3) is Numbercode for RobB So when you type in the code you're looking for you can then do a search in the 4th position of the second dimension of the array for the matching 4 digit code it's clunky and it's preferable if you set your sizes when you Dim and never resize ever again but it's functional At least until you get to learning about user define structures and such.
Don't need your advice.
Yet you posted here.
Why go through china to get to your neighbors house?

As CharlieMay said you can do executescalar() if the method you are using to access the SQL data allows that command. Or you you can just yank it out of the datatable your sql statement returns since you'll only have one record coming back you'll be able to do result = Datatable.rows(0).item("SalesSum") *SalesSum* being the alias you gave your Sum() in the sql statement. Keep in mind if you are summing a monetary value you may want to use a float rather than an Int or you'll lose accuracy.
yep, it's definitely something. Good luck on the turn in. Might pop back in at some random point in the future and show you a cleaner way. If you're interested.
For sure :P
You can do it many ways. If your doing multiple aggregate functions storing the row in a data table and the assigning the variables from a datatable item select. If you are only doing one then a select scalar or executescalar is your better tool
You just grab everything in the project folder in your documents visual studio files and then open the .sln file on the new pc once copied. The connection details for the database will need to be update to the ip of the sql server

Wouldnt alt+break stop the code ? Bt seriously tho, did you found something , i actually need this also but for another reason, i want a pop up to function as an state window,like one that says :13/100 workbooks worked without the need of user confirmation or anything
i don't need to do this anymore. Thanks!
this is the code I have so far. As of right now when i run the program and click on online nothing happens. I can not get it to list online the online portions that I would like it too Public Class Form1 ' Load the data into the arrays Dim strCourseNumbers() As String = {"CSC 105", "CSC 111", "CSC 121", "CSC 122", "CSC 161", "CSC 171", "CSC 223", "CSC 226", "CSC 240"} Dim strCourseNames() As String = {"Fundamentals of Programming (Alice)", "Introduction to Programming (Visual BASIC)", "Structured Programming (C++)", "Computer Science I", "Intro to Java", "Intro to Python", "Computer Science II", "Programming Languages", "Computer Organization"} Dim strCampus() As String = {"Blackwood", "OnLine", "Blackwood", "Blackwood", "OnLine", "Blackwood", "Blackwood", "Blackwood", "Blackwood"} Dim strDaysTimes() As String = {"Tue/Thur 10:00 AM", "Mon/Wed 9:30 AM", "Mon/Wed 11:00 AM", "Online TBA", "Online TBA", "Blackwood 8:10 PM", "Thur 520 PM", "Tue/Thur 9:30 AM", "Tue/Thur 12:00 PM"} Dim strRoom() As String = {"CIM 217", "Online", "CIM 217", "CIM 217", "OnLine", "CIM 110", "CIM 111", "CIM111", "CIM 114"} Dim strCredits() As String = {"4", "3", "4", "4", "3", "3", "4", "3", "3"} Private Sub btnSearch_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSearch.Click Dim intCount As Integer Dim blnFound As Boolean btnOnline.Checked = True blnFound = False intCount = 0 Do While blnFound And intCount &lt; strCampus.Length = False If strCampus(intCount) = "Online" Then blnFound = True End If intCount += 1 Loop If blnFound Then lstResults.Items.Add(strCampus.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCourseNames.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCourseNumbers.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strRoom.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCredits.Length) End If End Sub
You create a object called a "Random" and then pass in two numbers. A zero and the highest count in the list - 1 (since arrays/list start at ZERO!) &amp;#x200B; `Dim List&lt;string&gt; songs = new List&lt;string&gt;()` `songs.add("song name 1")` `songs.add("song name 2")` `songs.add("song name 3")` `Dim Generator As System.Random = New System.Random()` `Dim i as Integer =` [`Generator.Next`](https://Generator.Next)`(0, (songs.count - 1))` `string randomValue = songs[i]`
You can print the progress in the console or in a text box or as label text. The choice is yours.
Okay for starters, since I assume all positions of all arrays are related I would suggest moving all those arrays into one structure array. Look up how define a structure and how fill it and use it. You likely won't be able to fill it the same way but, to be honest you should look into making a comma separated list and then using that list to load all the data through a loop instead. Second; blnFound = False intCount = 0 Do While blnFound And intCount &lt; strCampus.Length = False No, no sweet summer child no. There is no need for you to setup a constraint like blnFound to begin with when a simple. For intCount = 0 to strCampus.Count - 1 Next will suffice Plus the do while as it is now will fail the moment you find a match and kick you out... actually the way it's written I'm pretty sure it will fail regardless. As it may be interpreted as While blnFound = True And intcount &lt; strCampus.Length = False But don't quote me on that part. lstResults.Items.Add(strCampus.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCourseNames.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCourseNumbers.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strRoom.Length) lstResults.Items.Add(strCredits.Length) Ok so this is just going to show the size of each array in your listbox. Which is another good reason to go with a For Next Loop. You want to move that code into the Loop and you want to either add All the items as one string with just one lstResults.Items.Add(array1 &amp; ", " &amp; array2 &amp; ", " &amp; *etc* ) or as individual things as you are doing now but then your listbox contents will look weird because it will be multiple blocks of 5 things. And you want to use strCampus(intCount), etc of strCampus.length
Additionally you can shove a status bar on your project and use a status label.
If this makes you give up and go ask someone to code it for you, you may want to consider just changing career paths to something else. Because this right here is going to happen A LOT.
also "Online" is not the same thing as "OnLine".
Your code is a mix of C# and VB but more importantly, you will never get song name 3 because songs.count-1 = 2 for the maxvalue and since maxvalue is exclusive, that would leave you only getting random indexes of 0 and 1. Other than that, this is a solution for the OP. So in case the OP is confused by this, the first line should be: Dim songs as New List (Of String) line 6 &amp; 7 should be: Dim i As Integer = Generator.Next(0, songs.count) Dim randomValue As String = songs[i]
Console feeds won't freeze.
Yes but unless you're making a console app, console feeds are generally not seen by users and are just for devs to see whats up.
Good catch, I switched over to C# a number of years ago and sometimes forget the syntax. Have a great weekend
I know what you mean. I still do a lot in VB.Net but my biggest problem now is starting a line with a type instead of Dim and having to go back and get rid of the semicolon.
lol. Yep, been there too many times. ALL my projects are now in C# to avoid this minor headache. But then, I'm working with VR so I don't have a choice.
With a recent version of VB, you can simplify even further: Dim songs = {"song 1","song 2","song 3"}.ToList Dim rnd = New System.Random() Dim randomValue = songs(rnd.Next(songs.Count))
It didn't include my image. Let me try this... [https://imgur.com/ZB2UGeu](https://imgur.com/ZB2UGeu)
Your error is right there. You're defining entityList as a type of ReadOnlyCollection(Of T) but then it looks like service.FindAll returns a type of ReadOnlyCollection(Of IEntity) I like that you're explicitly defining your types though, it is a really good habit to have in VB can you do service.Findall(Of T)(entity, startPosition, maxResults)? FYI it's easier if you paste code in here or your description. Paste it all in and highlight it, then click the button that looks like &lt;&gt; above the comment box, it'll make it look like code
well i mostly give up because i'm still in the basics of learning but i skipped a lot i should know but i dont know where to find it, so i'm blind trying things, i actually already made this by looking and looking and looking on internet for any solution but still dont know how could i make what i say on this thread, i dont have the knowledge but if i had the source i would inspect it step by step and finally understand it to start coding it myself.
Pretty nice we are almost there, it does create the wb control but it's on the same position, i'll search how to create it in like a new instance or a new window, something like that, with that done then we are ready! Thanks!
set the .Location property to where you want each new one to display.
There's a difference between help me solve it and write the code for me.
First, I'm betting your teacher is looking for you to use mod Mod basically returns the remainder of something i.e. 5 mod 2 will get you 1 because 5/2 is 2 with a remainder of one. So, if you do score mod 2 = 0, then it's even, other wise it's odd. So you can do one single if else to check on whether or not it's even Also, this simply allows you to check score, since it's one if. Now, the reason your if is always true is some VB magic going on here. You're doing if dice1 + dice2 = 2 or 4 or 6 the or parts are basically saying or 4 or 6, which vb is automagically converting to true because it doesn't know what you mean by or 4, and is essentially converting things on the back end for you. I'm not shitting on VB but this is a huge downfall of losely typed languages, when the parser tries to interpret things for you because you accidentally wrote something wrong, and it's trying to automatically convert things for you. If you wanted to do an or like that, it would have to look like this if (dice1 + dice2 = 2) or (dice1 + dice2 = 4) or (dice1 + dice2 = 6) etc But, as I mentioned earlier, you can use mod and do this in a single if statement. Let me know if you have questions
Yikes
Plus, the max of Random.Next is exclusive so dice.Next(1,6) is only going to ever get to 5, never 6
Good catch
Thanks
Thanks!
**UPDATE: I got it to work!** Apparently, you need to add **Allow User Variables=True** to the end of the connection string. Return New MySqlConnection("SERVER=x.x.x.x;USER ID=randomusername;PASSWORD=supersecretpassword;DATABASE=mydatabase;Allow User Variables=True")
That's for changing the location on the same window, means that if we create 90 processes of new webbrowsers all of them will be tight, we need to create a new window for each one of them :P
Talk for yourself brother, if someone writes a code **it does teach me about coding**. So yeah, i learnt by seeing the code he gave me, one thing is not learning because u dont know what does something do, another thing is not knowing what is the syntaxis that will make it work.
Just treat the whole string as 1 big word. Remember the space character is a real character just like A, B, C... Go through the string and "fill in" all of the spaces before starting each round
thank you guys for replying anyways!
thank you guys for replying anyways!
Due to the size of this post, let me first start off by saying "Good Job!!!" While there are some code improvements to be had here, you have done what you set out to do and that is to create working game. As far as your questions: Create an array with words and/or phrases. Use the random class to generate a random number from 0 to the length of the array. Use this random number to pass into the index of the array and set that to your secret_word. You will then need to change up your `LoadLabelDisplay()` code to check the secret_word for spaces so that you can denote spaces to the player. Something like: Sub LoadLabelDisplay() lblTempWord.Text = "" Dim LengthOfSecretWord As Integer LengthOfSecretWord = Secret_Word.Length - 1 Dim LetterPosition As Integer For LetterPosition = 0 To LengthOfSecretWord If Secret_Word.Substring(LetterPosition, 1) = " " Then lblTempWord.Text = lblTempWord.Text &amp; " " Else lblTempWord.Text = lblTempWord.Text &amp; "-" End If Next End Sub As far as the win count. You could just add another label and increment a number based on what the label has +1. But keep in mind, you do not want to clear this label unless the player want to restart. Now when the `You Win` message comes up, just start a new game which should select a new `Secret_Word`. Also, if you're interested, this code can be Greatly reduced. There are ways to enable and disable a group of buttons with only a few lines of code but it may be out of the scope of what you're being taught and you might not be able to use it for class. For example, if you were to drag all of your letter buttons into a panel (Panel1). You could simply use: Sub EnableButtons(opt As Boolean) 'opt is true to enable all, false for disable all For Each b As Button In Panel1.Controls.OfType(Of Button) b.Enabled = opt Next End Sub Now this sub does both, if you want to enable all buttons you would just call `EnableButtons(true)`. If you want to disable all of them you would call `EnableButtons(false)`. So not only have you reused a method, you have removed a minimum of 52 lines of code with only 3. You could also remove a lot of repeating code with the buttons by combining the handlers and using the `Sender` object from the event signature to handle the button. This would take all 26 button click events, put them into one Button_Click Method and use 3 lines of code to Cast the sender object, set the `Enabled` property to False and send the letter to the `GuessLetter()` method.

I have no idea what you're asking for. Please elaborate.
You'd first need to create a form that has a text box and a button in it. Then to get the text int he box it would be theIdYouGiveTheTextbox.Text
I have made the text box and button already thanks. but i dont know how i would replace the NAME with what i put in the text box and i also need a way for it to Export the info from the command it runs into the program?
I would like it like this So next to name it would have the name / groups /last log in. it can get all that info from the net user NAME /Domain command? but i dont know how i would get it to put the results into the form.
concatenation is what I think you're asking. In VB.Net, the Apersand (&amp;) is used to concatenate two strings together. For example if I had a `txtName` textbox and I enter `CharlieMay` into it. I could simply perform a Console.WriteLine("Hello my Reddit username is: " &amp; txtName.Text Which would output `Hello my Reddit username is: CharlieMay`
it's possible to exec a system command and get the output, but it would be better to just implement it using the System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity object.
Thanks But how would i do it
If i wanted it to take the Full Name and put it next the Name Label?
Photo?/
Thank you so much for the help! I did some of the stuff you suggested and it works but I'm having trouble making it randomized. Also I decided I wanted to make a next word button, would copying the code from the start button and putting it into the next button work? And then my final problem I created another label like you suggested to keep track of score. I put If lblTempWord.Text = Secret\_Word Then Label1.Text = Label1.Text + 1 in my code but it doesn't work as I hoped.
Here is my code for the start button (the sub the chooses the word) Private Sub btnStart\_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles [btnStart.Click](https://btnStart.Click) Dim wordlist() As String ReDim wordlist(0 To 29) &amp;#x200B; wordlist(0) = "CAKE" wordlist(1) = "VELOCITY" wordlist(2) = "MONEY" wordlist(3) = "DOG" wordlist(4) = "BABY" wordlist(5) = "CHURCH" wordlist(6) = "VIOLIN" wordlist(7) = "RICE" wordlist(8) = "TROMBONE" wordlist(9) = "TEST" wordlist(10) = "HANGMAN" wordlist(11) = "DORITO" wordlist(12) = "LOVE" wordlist(13) = "SCHOOL" wordlist(14) = "XYLOPHONE" wordlist(15) = "OFFENSE" wordlist(16) = "ENIGMA" wordlist(17) = "BURRITO" wordlist(18) = "STRENGTH" wordlist(19) = "COMMUNISIM" wordlist(20) = "TEMPTATION" wordlist(21) = "ROCK" wordlist(22) = "PYTHON" wordlist(23) = "VOID" wordlist(24) = "FLASHCARD" wordlist(25) = "HIPPO" wordlist(26) = "DANCE" wordlist(27) = "TECHNOLOGY" wordlist(28) = "ICE" wordlist(29) = "LEGEND" &amp;#x200B; NumWrong = 0 EnableButtons() btnStart.Enabled = False Secret\_Word = wordlist(randomNumber) LoadLabelDisplay() DisplayHangman(NumWrong) &amp;#x200B; End Sub
So no sorry what time trying to do. is if i had a text box and entered Jeff then i clicked the button i would like it to run the command net user Jeff /Domain and i would like it to tell me what returns?
&gt; System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity you start by googling "System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity" and trying out the examples from microsoft's official docs. then you can ask a more specific question about what you learn from that
is it a ` or a ' ? set a breakpoint and step though, see what you're getting that isn't what you expect. use Asc() function to check its ascii code.
It’s a good old plain ASCII 39, as far as I’m concerned... when I tried to set a breakpoint for a lowercase a it wouldn’t detect that either...
I don't mean set a change break, pick a line of code and set a breakpoint there... press F9 should do it. inspect all the things.
Even a total junior programmer rate is at least 50 dollars per hour. We're all laughing at your 10 bucks
I mean go on Fiverr.... They charge like 5 but it takes up to 2 days, cant wait that long.
Lol
Oh, I set all kinds of Console.Write’s all over the place....
this isn't php. break and inspect real time.
what have you tried?
well I have tried so far to try dim input as integer [combobox1.select](https://combobox1.select) = ("Matinee $16") then lblresults.text = input\*16
but its not working at all lol
is there supposed to be an `if` and `end if`? where are assigning `input`? are you sure the `.select` property does what you think it does? you probably want the `.text` property.
What information do you have about the virtual machine? Do you have the IP or MAC address? Is this this a network question or do you want to use the VM API to access information about the VM network configuration and status?
i tired this but still returning 0, [https://gyazo.com/3b7544c918d6b46a29afa1816ef261e4](https://gyazo.com/3b7544c918d6b46a29afa1816ef261e4)
Here is a working example, if you have visual studio you can create a new forms project, add a button to the form and then copy the following into the code behind of the form: Public Class Form1 Dim FilePath As String = "C:\temp\reddit.txt" Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim File As New System.IO.FileInfo(FilePath) If File.Exists Then 'Read in the file content Dim Content As String = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(FilePath) 'split the content by apostroph char Dim SplittedContent() As String = Content.Split("'") 'count the index of the contentparts, 'a even index is before the apostrophes 'an odd index is inbetween the apostrophes Dim Index_Counter As Integer = 1 'a variable to store the resulting text without the stuff between apostrophes Dim FileContent_Without_ApostrophContent As String = "" For Each ContentPart In SplittedContent If Not isInBetweenApostrophes(Index_Counter) Then Debug.Print(ContentPart) FileContent_Without_ApostrophContent &amp;= ContentPart Else 'ignore the content between Apostrophes or do something else with it End If Index_Counter += 1 Next End If End Sub 'a helper to find out if the current index is odd or even Private Shared Function isInBetweenApostrophes(Index As Integer) As Boolean Return Index Mod 2 = 0 End Function End Class
Update: The code in the picture works for Matinne but not for Evening
don't panic. just follow the code, line by line, think about the result of each line. the 2nd if is inside the first if, which means the 2nd won't be tested unless the first is true, and both can't be true at once.
Thank you for your help bro, just figured it out :) [https://gyazo.com/fa3600c16c952d2bd61f8c3b1340fda3](https://gyazo.com/fa3600c16c952d2bd61f8c3b1340fda3)
FYI if someone put text in the txtTickets.text it will error on you. You can handle that by doing something like this before you set input if not isnumeric(txtTickets.Text) then lblTotal.Text = "Please enter a valid number" exit sub end if
Thank you!! I will add that now, this dumbass Splash screen is giving me errors lol
that is actually giving me this error, System.InvalidCastException: 'Conversion from string "h" to type 'Decimal' is not valid.'
Not sure how you're doing it but can you just put your splash screen and then form items (text box and buttons) in two panels. And then set .visible on each one as needed?
What's your code? The is numeric should have caught that
Im freaking out now lol it wont let me open the project anymore its saying see output window for details this spash screen fucked me over big time
i have a bigger issue now lol it wont even let me open the project it is saying see output window for details , this always happens with the fucking splash screens lol
 If buffer = "'" Then you defined buffer as an array, so you are saying is my array of type char equal to a char of ' but it will never be, because you are comparing the actual array object to a char object, not what the array is storing. if buffer(0) = "'" then Should work for a comparison. Also, since array indexing starts at 0, your declaration Dim buffer(1) As Char Is making an array with 2 elements. Dim buffer(0) as Char Will give you a single element array (but this is not a cause of a bug in your code). You could of course pull the whole string in, and use IndexOf to find your apostrophes
Welcome to programming
The problem is, defining buffer(1) leaves you with an array of 2 elements, Your IF statement should specify the element you want to compare. In this case element (0). Try changing your if statement to If Buffer(0) = "'" Then
Can you provide a screenshot?
Out of curiosity, if you add a new button to the form and set it's fontsize, does it reset too? This sounds like it has something to do with AutoScaleMode
Couple of things; * You should not need the '' around your ? * ADODB has weird behaviors with parameters where if you set .CommandText or .ActiveConnection before the parameters it may or may not create a parameter by itself. giving you more parameters than you need. try adding Debug.Print cmd.Parameters.Count right after your parameters.append you'll sometimes see that you have 2 parameters instead of 1. To fix this move your .CommandText or .ActiveConnection so that it occurs after the addparam * Size is only for variable types like adVarchar, it will be ignored for anything else.
as /u/chrwei said, alll that info can be accessed using System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity google that to find the MSDN documentation which will have examples on how to use it.
That's it, changed the AutoScaleMode and problem has gone. Thanks very much!
first, if you reply to yourself I don't get any notice, I only say this because i was tagged. 2nd, forget the command line. use the object. it'll be more work and more error prone to text parse the command line. start with the example, learn it, understand it, then use what you learned. we're not doing it for you.

somewhere I have the websetup installer for 2008 and 2010 express. if you'd like, I can upload them somewhere later this day, when I'm home. however, keep in mind that you won't be able to activate those, since the activation pages do not exist anymore, but you can find keys online that work, though.
You don't have to share your code with Microsoft what are you talking about?
Is the name of the MC Access 2013 file the same on your machine and the laptop. Is it in the same place? Is it the exact same version of MC Access 2013? Is the Oledb.Connection.Ace.12.0 in the odbc data sources (64-bit)? are they the same in both machines?
The file has the same name. It is in the same directory (I even made sure the USB's drive letter is the same). I don't have access on my pc at home and only on my laptop (which is strange because the connection only works on the pc). The file is a .accdb file. The data sources are the same on both machines. BTW sorry if I'm not providing all info I'm not an expert at all on these things :)
You installed this? https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39358
No, I installed this: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255) Will I need to install that to make it work aswell?
Well you said you were referencing a 2013 database file and the link I posted is for the 2013 access runtime. The one you posted is the 2010 runtime so it's worth a shot to install the 2013 one and see what that gets you.
Thanks, I'll try that :)
If I understand the question.. within the button click, do the total cost * the discount rate + cost * discount rate + cost * discount rate etc. Then do the total cost - what that equals. Have an if statement for if the checkbox is unchecked and if it is unchecked set the discount rate = 0. For instance, If chkbox1. Checked = False Then discount1 = 0 Else chkbox1.Checked = True Then Discount1 = # if chkbox 2.checked = False Then Discount2 = 0 Else chkbox 2.checked = true then Discount2 = # if etc = false then And so forth Then at the end Total cost * discount1 + total cost * discount2 + etc = totalDiscount Price = total cost - totalDiscount I would put another if statement for payment method. If rdbQuarterly. Checked = true then paymentMethod = price/4 Elseif etc Then set the textbox or whatever you are using for output equal to price or paymentMethod. You will need to convert it to a string though. I would just declare the variables you are using for math as doubles. Hope this helps.
Well I guess the first thing the function should do is validate the number of discounts chosen is &lt;= 3 Then take the annual premium text box and make sure it's a number. Then you need to multiply your premium by your discounts. You'll need to decide if that's don't multiplicatively or additively. ((($1000 - 3%) - 4%) - 2%) is a different value than $1000 - 9% Then divide it by a certain number, depending on the radio button selected ( divide by 12, 3, 2, or 1 depending on monthly, quarterly, semi, annually) Write the value to the output box
This is very helpful thank you! I think the part im having the hardest time with is the conversion for the text box? Its supposed to be able to put any number into the textbox and then create the output but im having real issues with how to write that, how do I make a program recognize the number in the text box as the cost
The problem is that you are using the same datatable for each datagridview. Yes, you're clearing it but when you re-fill it, you've already assigned dt to each one and it's the same instance. instantiate a new datatable with each button. Instead of dt.Clear, replace it with dt = new DataTable()
Where price equals the number you want to display and txtOutput is the name of the textbox. Output to textbox: txtOutput. Text = price.ToString If you wanted to use the number that’s in the textbox... then to reference it do variableName = Cdbl (txtOutput.text) For the purposes of your project, I don’t believe you will need the second part.
Thank you very much for the help, didn't realize that was the problem.

I havent had to do any validations yet so this is new to me. Ill give it a try
you'll need to read in a line and parse into a structure/class, then read the whole file into a List of that structure, then sort it, then write it all out.if it's too big to fit in ram you'll need to do some pretty advanced file gymnastics.
hmm... maybe I wasnt super clear, I guess im asking how do you code it so that the program will take any number put into the Text box at the top and use that for the calculations of percentages?
Maybe I have been staring at this to long... Im starting to get angry and thats not good
What are you confused about, maybe I can explain. Try to be specific with what you want to happen.
In the top text box labled Annual Premium, How do I program it to take any number? For instance if I wanted to calculate the Monthly Premium of a 2000 dollar plan, i.e. entering "2000" into the box when the program is running. How does the program know if its 2000? What if next I wanted to type in 2100? I hope thats more specific. The text box is just a text box and I have no idea how to make the program just accept the number that is put into it and then do the discount deductions according the whatever price the premium is. Basically I dont have a constant for the text box it would be a variable right? because its an unknown number until the user inputs a number of their choice? I just honestly have no idea how to set that up. It's extra frustrating because my professors response is "you have to figure it out" to all of my questions...
Declare a variable: Dim variableName as Double (you can do integer if you want a whole number) Set the variable equal to the textbox: variableName = Cdbl( txtboxName.text) Use Cint if declares the variable as an integer Then the variable will equal what’s in the textbox
Ahhh I see. So Dim txtAnnualPremium as Double txtAnnualPremium = Cdbl ?? Or do i create a whole new name for the variable?
It's nothing special. Just tally up the number of check boxes that are checked, and if the amount is over three, then just return to exit the method. You can be even fancier and use a message box to let the user know why it failed your validation so they know how to fix it
pretty sure OP is wearing a 3 piece tinfoil suit with matching hat, shoes and tie.
1) You can get hold of the value that the user enters in the textbox by checking what is stored in the txtAnnualPremium.text property. (Or whatever the name you have assigned to the textbox in your project!) This .text property is a string. Even if the user inputs a number (for instance 3000) the data is a string. When reading the value from the textbox and assigning it to your own variable (let's say you made a Double called AnnualPremium) you need to convert the string value from the textbox to a double, to be able to store it in the AnnualPremium variable. To do this you use CDouble(textAnnualPremium.text). Basically it's short for C(onvert to) Double. And the string value you want to convert, goes in the parenthesis. (The textbox in this case). The code would be; AnnualPremium = CDouble(txtAnnualPremiumtext.text) If you in stead wanted to store the value from the user in an Int variable, you would use CInt () in stead of CDouble. (Basically short for C(onvert to) Int) 2) An important point is to validate what the user inputs in the textbox before doing calculations. What would happen if the user writes his name in the textbox? It's still a string, and MIGHT possibly be converted to a numeric value, but would result in either a massive program error, or at least give a non-logical answer. Good luck 🤞
Can you give a small bit more context. Are A and B constantly changing or are they constants that you just shortened for anonymity sake. What is D for? Are you creating the file that must be read or is it already pre created elsewhere (could you reformat it?) I have a few ideas but these answers dictate what would work
Thank you for the offer. I found an old sealed copy on E-Bay. For $50, I just bought that so I don't have any license issues with Microsoft. My intention is to stand it up in a VM as the only software running, so I can code things and then deploy to an IIS host if I have something I want to run. This way I will have it in perpetuity the next time I upgrade (I'm thinking ahead).
The "community" version gives Microsoft access to the code.
No it doesn't. Are you talking about it's integration with github that is 100% completely optional? What makes you think Microsoft engineers and developers have any interest in your code, even if they could access it?
Microsoft and Apple both have a history of integrating 3rd party apps into their future OS releases. I am old enough to remember when Microsoft came out with Dos 6.0 and stole another company's whole-disk compression technology.
Anybody who develops like this need to get there head examined.
Well this 5 mins job still looks better than most of the UI's out there trust me
No way man, I'm writing the next big operating system in VBA because it is a superior language.

No it really does not for a modern interface. The interface here is what we built 10 years ago.

Yes I know that website I have tried and I know the problem is with my array values but I cant figure out how to fix it... please help
Dim area(2) as Integer is the Problem When you create this you can access area(0) and area(1). YOu have to initialize "Dim area(3) as Integer" to have area(0), area(1) and area(2)
Thank you very much... I will try this when I wake up tomorrow and let you know if it works
Dim area(2) is a 3 element array. Giving you storage at area(0), area(1) and area(2). Dim area(3) would allow you to store 4 values.
The issue you have is you are not sending the values to the Areacalculator function. Personally I would change the signature of the function to Function Areacalculator(byval l as integer, byval w as integer) as integer then inside this method you only need to place Return l*w But before this can work, you also never assign the values in your textboxes to the length or widthx variables. So before the call to Areacalculator() you need to store them length = Int32.Parse(txt_length.Text) widthx = Int32.Parse(txt_width.text) then you call to the function would need to change to area(counter - 1) = Areacalculator(length, widthx) There's a few issues otherwise that I'll let you sort out but this should give you an end result. You should also explicitly set the return type in the functions (notice `As Integer` in my example). Going to the very top of your code, above all other code, putting Option Strict = On will show you some errors that could cause issues at runtime if they are not dealt with.
Thank you very much I will try this asap
How to ask a vague question and ensure you don't get any help
removing. Throw away account, not enough information.
Hi, &amp;#x200B; Just to add to what Charlie May posted .. There are a couple of other small issues in your code. You could move this line &amp;#x200B; `counter=counter+1` &amp;#x200B; to just below &amp;#x200B; `area(counter-1) = AreaCalculator(length, widthx)` &amp;#x200B; so that you don't have to have `counter-1` in that line &amp;#x200B; Also of course, now you don't need the `k` variable so you can remove the definition. &amp;#x200B; Finally, and exercise for you .. What happens if the calculated area is EXACTLY 500? :-) &amp;#x200B; Don't forget.. programming can be frustrating, annoying and stressful, BUT it should be fun!
I think this is probably what you're looking for. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/automate-excel-from-visual-basic-net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/automate-excel-from-visual-basic-net)
Why don't you use VBA ?
you can use office interop, which requires excel be installed. con: it's not terrible fast you can use ado via the excel driver and some SQL, which only requires an excel file with headers rows already be present. con: a little harder to code the simplest is to just append lines to a CSV file, excel, or any spreadsheet application, will open it just fine. con: can't save formatting or formulas
The appending lines to a csv file will this be automated? My 6 text box keep getting updated with the sensor values from my Arduino project. So as the values keep getting updated I would want them to be added to an Excel/csv or at the very least a text file
A CSV file is just a comma delimited text file. You can output the values as you receive them from the arduino, and export to the CSV. Excel can open CSV files without any issues, as long as the application is not tying up the file to continually output data.
VBA is not always the answer to everything. For instance, in this example, they're using VB.NET to interface with their arduino device as a standalone application. You cannot do this with VBA without having an independent application to execute the VBA scripting. At that point, you might as well design your own application to do the interfacing, especially considering it's an arduino which they are already coming up with custom code for.
If you have office loaded on your machine, there is an object for creating an Excel file. &amp;#x200B; Alternatively, I have always hard-coded .csv files for this and used chr(34) and chr(44) to separate and format the file.

Hi Visual Basic Express, is not more longer available.. It was replacement by Visual Studio Community. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ Regards. Gerardo HS.
Like you're trying to simulate a login on another website?
yeah basically simulate login into twitch
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not trying to do something malicious. You'd basically need to simulate whatever kind of request it makes to login, posting data properly however the button does. What exactly is your end goal of this project?
I dont know how do you want me to simulate it since i cant reach to \*simulate a click on the login button\* And i want to create a bot for accepting my friend requests.
Gotcha. So what I meant by simulate is when you click that button, something is happening. More than likely some request is getting posted to an end point at twitch with the credentials you typed in. It's generally pretty hard to simulate a login (on purpose) via a program. You might look into seeing if twitch has an API you can utilize
uuhh i think we are not looking the same objective... It's pretty simple to login into facebook with a program, it's not easy to login into twitch with a program, why tho? Cause twitch has no "id" for using `WebBrowserDePruebas.Document.GetElementById("loginbutton").InvokeMember("Click")` and facebook does. But apart of that, the source code from the page on "[twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv)" is like hidden or something strange cuz i cant search where is the code of the button but i can if i do Right Click and "Inspect", but looks like vb uses SourceCode and if that doesnt appear at source code then it doesnt work. I think it is something like that but i dont know, so if anyone knows i would be glad to see some code about how is it possible to click it the way i would do it with the code i've put of `invokemember("click)`
[Visual Studio Older Versions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) Might be too late for OP, but for anyone else who's interested. I recently had to find VS 2015 (Solidworks' API only supports 2015), and found this link. You can download them as .iso files as well as the web installers.
Sounds like you downloaded a disc image of the VB6 installer. You would unmount the disc image to remove the drive from your computer.
You downloaded an .iso image of a disc. Windows 10 mounts it as a virtual drive. Look in there for a 'setup' program, and run that. It will install like you are using a DVD.
Thanks a ton. I'm new to this, and literally have no Idea what I'm doing.
FYI: you can get old versions straight out of Microsoft’s MSDN archives. In general you can trust shit from that.
Well for now I think I might have lucked out (probably expending my luck for the entire year) I'll definitely be downloading from their from here on.
cool. How do i do that, again?
Hi, I have already tried all of these before i post. Anyway, I'm running it on Visual Studio 2017 [VB.Net](https://VB.Net) platform. &amp;#x200B; I guess, I will just put it straight the value to the CommandText instead of putting in on CreateParameter. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for the help.
Visual Studio 2019 is free and has Visual Basic and like 15 other languages in it.
So it looks like you're wanting each item to have \~50 uses before replacement. You could calculate how many days since first use and divide that by the number of times it's been used to give you how many days pass per use. After that it's pretty straightforward. Just take the number of days per use multiply it by 50 and add that to the initial use date to give you a running estimate of when it'll get retired.
Cheers mate
you have to code it. very little is automatic when you're writing programs.
What is your question?
Sorry about that. I just realized I never actually asked the question. I edited my original post to actually ask the question I was looking for an answer to.
Put it in a module or class, not the form. I mean you can use the form, but preferred not to.
If you want to make them in the form declare them as public at the top of your Form1 code window. Public intScore as Integer To access it from another Form: Form1.intScore += 1 It would be better practice to put them in a module, but not necessary.
This solved my entire issue, thank you!
&gt;why my Dim conversion is giving me a red line under it When a piece of code is underlined in red, the compiler will give you a specific message in the error list. What does it say? &gt; Dim AnnualPremium As Double = DataGridViewColumnDividerDoubleClickEventArgs(txtAnnualPremium.Text) What do you think this line means? How did you come up with this piece of code? &gt; If chkFullTimeStudent.Checked = False Then cstFullTimeStudent = 0 What do you think the keyword `Const` does? Why did you choose to put it in your code?
I came up with this piece of code from help on my other post.. Its supposed to be my conversion line I believe but I truly don't actually understand what it means. The error it gives me says that it "cannot be used as an expression" I used Const as my constants my program is supposed to calculate percentage discounts on insurance based on what is picked. So if someone picked a Full Time Student discount it would always be a constant of 3% discount and never change from a 3% discount unless I have the wrong idea of what a constant means?
The post from last week doesn't mention `DataGridViewColumnDividerDoubleClickEventArgs` anywhere. Constant means that the value can never change, yes. So what do you think the code `cstFullTimeStudent = 0` will do?
Well the commenter helped me and said to write it as Cdbl and visual basic automatically converted it into that line datagridview, Ohhh so by telling the program my constant means zero it is basically a redundancy causing issues? Instead I should just make it checked = false then = 0? Instead of listing the constant until the checked = true then = cstfulltimestudent?
 Dim AnnualPremium As Double = Cdbl(txtAnnualPremium.Text) Cdbl() is a method that takes a string representing a value and casts it to a type Double. While this is prone to errors because of invalid inputs, we won't get into TryParse() as you don't need to be overwhelmed with all these new concepts. Now, your if statements as you're trying to use them are not going to work because you're trying to change a Const (which isn't even the issue). The issue is you're trying to come up with a Percentage based on what all was checked. If I were to ask you what my percentage of saving would be if I was a 32 year old, full time student with a good driving record that was single and smoked living in my parents basement. How would you answer that question? You would go through each item and add up the relevant values and tell me my savings would be .08. This is exactly how you are going to do this here. Dim PercentSavings as double = 0 If chkFullTimeStudent.Checked = True Then PercentSaving += cstFullTimeStudent If chkGoodDriver.Checked = True Then PercentSavinge += cstGoodDriver '... 'continue if statements for each checkbox Notice the += this is the same as saying whatever value PercentSavings holds, keep it and add this new value. So we start at 0 and if FullTimeStudent is checked then PercentSavings = 0 + .03 which is .03 Next, if GoodDriver is checked then PercentSavings = .03 + .05 which is .08 As we continue down the if statements, we add everything checked and once we're done we have accumulated a total to use to calculate the savings.
Hey thank you so much, this is so well thoughtout and helpful to me! It is literally the clearest breakdown of the logic needed behind the program something I was really struggling with. Also thank you for clarifying the use of the variable with the If statement itself. It makes so much more sense to add up the relevant values instead of trying to break them all into seperate pieces and then put them together.
- bin/Debug/ Or - bin/x64/Debug/
Thankss &lt;3
It didn't convert it to that line, it's most likely you had a finger slip and it ended up that way. Visual Studio will make recommendations as type, but it will never "automatically" change something.
What languages do you know now? If you know a few, you'll pick up VB6 in no time. It's pretty simple, although it's not just a language, it's a development environment. So there is some learning involved there. I don't know what the free version entails but I did VB6 development for many years so I owned the retail version. That version had some issues installing on modern versions of Windows (8 and newer). Assuming you're on Windows 10 you may have some problems installing it. Here's the site I used when I last installed VB6 (on Windows 8, but the instructions should apply to 10 as well): https://www.fortypoundhead.com/showcontent.asp?artid=23916
The C family, php, js, java, python, and a few others. But thank you ill see what i can do. Ha id be nice not to install a bulky vm just to try it
Not really, no. The final release of VB6 was in 1998. I'm guessing you aren't much older than that ;)
It is absolutely nothing near to C or ~~MS-Java~~ C#. It only shares a few keywords like if/while/do/for I would look at example programs and get a copy of the MSDN library so you can look up the statements and functions
No, it's very different than .NET. Even [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) is much different. In fact, old VB6 programmers that I know had a hard time migrating to the new [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) when the change happened and some pursued other lines of work. You might have a difficult time with it if you're familiar with C# and .NET. [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) would be right up your ally though.
Haha ya i am. I was just wondering if how .net a vb6 both use guis and if its similar style. Ive spoken to one of the teachers at my school about it so i have a very rough idea about it
Thanks will do.
Thanks and ya i dont mind diffiuclty by any means. Im looking yo basically expand my knowledge. Would you say its a fun language to use once you get a decent grasp or is it something like perl?
In my opinion VB6 is not fun. It could be that I'm biased because I maintain a lot of old code that started life in VB6 or were written by poor VB6 programmers. Because of it's permissive nature, meaning you can write really bad code in it, people tend to write really bad code in it. VB.NET is an entirely different story however. It can be permissive but with if you're using the .NET library instead of the old VB6 shims and if you enable a couple of options to make code make sense it can be very enjoyable. Note that I started programming with BasicA, AppleSoft Basic, Integer Basic, and QBasic. I've written code professionally in VBA, VB6, VB.NET, C++, C#, PHP, Python, Bash. This is just to give you an idea of my background and where I'm coming from. Someone else may disagree with me entirely.
Thanks appreciate the honesty. And thats what this job entails. Did you intentionally choose legacy or just the jobs you happened to take?
I interviewed for a job that had three different positions open with three different teams. Two of the teams were legacy. I had no idea what I was getting into, honestly. In my final interview by phone I asked if I would be writing VB or C# and she suggested that I would be writing some VB but it would be mostly C# new development. Well, it wasn't. The job has treated me very well and in 5 years I've almost doubled my pay. I think that's mainly because nobody wants to deal with the stuff I deal with and I handle it with a positive attitude. As we've grown in the past 5 years and my responsibilities have grown it's come time for me to hand off my responsibilities to other developers. Most of our devs now are C# focused and they don't like the old [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) code. We're slowly replacing it but it will be a while. The nastiest of it is gone though or will be soon. I just got to rewrite the last big piece of nasty code this year. We have some pretty decent [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) code left that won't be replaced for a while. People still hate working on it though.
Congrats dude. But ya like the pay is nice. I mainly care i have a good challenge. But ya the position is basically for someone new to come in and handle maintenance or vb code and some other things. Mainly vb so the lead developer could focus on more pressing things. Theyre currently working on switching out of it as well. But again appreciate the honesty.
If you have the time, feel free to stop by r/Excel and r/VBA for any VBA posts. VBA is very old, and was based on VB6 when it was originally incorporated into the MS Office Suite. If you can get the hang of VBA code posted in those subreddits, you should be able to work fairly well with VB6. It's a slightly more capable and independent version of VBA, but still limited in what it can do due to age. If your job will involve VB6 code, it will be very much worth it to learn VB.NET to update the codebase. But if you're already familiar with the C family, you might as well convert everything over to C# for better support.
It's "between C and C#" like I'm currently between Angelina Jolie and Taylor Swift. It's a loosely object-oriented version of Basic, with some but not all features of OOP. It is completely un-C-like, un-Jave-like, etc. If you are too young to grow up programming in Basic on your TI calculator, maybe you programmed in VBA for MS Office products (the macros are written a bastard version of VB). That's pretty similar. Crack open Word or Excel and write some stuff. Damn close. And I've developed programs professionally in everything mentioned above.
Will do. And thanks but the job im applying for relieves the lead to rewrite everything. Ill check those subs out though
I am in my second week of a new job that only uses VB6 and I had no prior VB6 experience before starting. I was worried at first too about the transition and couldn't get the IDE we use at the office to install on my home computer(I'm obsessed about practicing) but I have found VB6 easy to pick up. Prior experience: 1 year C# and .NET and 5 years Python.
VB6 is quite similar to VBA so if you know that you should get the hang of it quickly
Ph man quite a bit of python but thanks for the confidence boost. Im not really worried about having issues honestly or more so just wanting to learn something new
By chance is that free?
VBA is built into Microsoft access/excel so if you have office, yes.
Okay thanks and ya i got office through school.
Back in the days before the internet, the VB6 Black Book was my reference of choice. https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Basic-6-Black-Book/dp/1576102831 Read through it in a week, covered enough that I was making programs and working on other people's code after that week was up. Though depending on what you know now, it may be overkill.
Thanks for the recommendation. If i do end up getting the position ill consider getting it.
It’s a fairly easy starter language. It’s very forgiving and allows for some ugly code practices. I would not call it “fun” though. I don’t know of anyone doing anything new in it other than legacy maintenance.
Holy moly thanks so much for taking the time out to read this. I gave it a once over and have no idea what's going on so I'm gonna have to really digest it to see what's going on. Thanks so much for commenting everything so I can learn from it :D
I recommend stopping by the posts in r/VBA as it's based on VB6. There are even posts about VBA in r/Excel. These would at the very least get you acquainted with the syntax of VB6. You still need to tinker with the IDE of VB6 to get a better feel for it. I highly recommend getting familiar with VB.NET as it's the latest iteration of VB, and is far more capable than VB6 will ever be. It would also allow you to have all the benefits of the .NET Framework, and allow you to tinker with C#.
Vb6 is not .net so be aware it’s not current but it’s valid to learn the concepts. I’d suggest msdn documentation that installs alongside vb6. The normal places have ISO’s and you can get it via msdn I think for free still. As far as learning I would trawling the usual places for Ebooks. Oreillys in a nutshell. Dummies guide to vb6. Vb6 in 24 hours etc
in addition to this learning it's important to know that the best way to learn is to try and make things! start making programs today, whatever cool thing you can think of. the more you code, the more you'll learn little tricks and be able to speak "fluent code"
Keep in mind VB6 was last updated over 20 years ago and is not a modern language. But there really hasn't been anything like it since and a lot of people (myself included) still enjoy using it. As for resources, there are old books you can find for dirt cheap on eBay.
I don't know of any (legal) way to download vb6 for free. Even if you get the ISO you will need a CD Key to install it. Vb.net is free, but it's quite a bit different than vb6.
planetsourcecode.com has alot of vb6 source code to browse through
Hey, elfer90, just a quick heads-up: **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
I would suggest a newer version, not 2006, because it lacks lots of functions. Get yourself VS2017 and start looking for tutorials and follow them until you get used with the environment. Also, you could also look for C#
So, I have a few questions: &amp;#x200B; 1) Is there a reason you have so many if statements? Why don't you just throw all the id #'s into an array and then just cycle through them with a for/next loop? &amp;#x200B; 2) How are you associating the id # with the entry time? Without that, you won't be able to check later to determine if the id# has already entered today.
I use VB.Net with Monogame and it works very well. One stumbling block when starting is the lack of VB templates for Monogame other than the UWP project, but you can use one of the C# templates as a guide to manually set up your VB/Monogame project.
Hi, 1. There is no particular reason, I am just more comfortable with if statements/less familiar with arrays. 2. I'm just using the current time, so if somebody hits their ID at say 8am, it will record it will jump to the next available excel column and record the time.

I started with VB back in 93 (2.0) and continued using it for more than a decade, before switching to C# because it is in use more than VB. A couple of years ago I picked up Unity, which uses c#, to learn VR development. So I don't see the value of another engine just so we can use VB.... but my lack of sight does not mean it's not a good idea, so please feel free to enlighten me to what I am missing.
No. vb.net is not a language I would use to make video games. I speak from experience for I have made games with vbnet. C# on Unity 3D is largely supported. JavaScript for games is better supported than vb.net. Godot IDE and framework supports a half dozen languages including .net. All of choices are fully cross platform allowing you to target and device or platform. Doing it in vb.net is a waste of your effort for it is virtually impossible to do anything outside of desktop. As for not wanting to change language, Any developer who is not willing to learn more than one language is not a developer they are a monocoder. Learn to program don't learn a language.
Get the hell out of here hacker. We don't support your crap here. For those who don't know CSRF is a type of attack which tricks the victim to do the malicious task on a victim authenticated web application on behalf of attackers interests.
I’m not sure if this is a joke or not but I need the mid and csrftoken to have an app login to instagram
This is not a joke. The only reason to write a program to retrieve CSFR would be to mimic a login and try to do things in another app. Especially since the Instagram API give you access to all endpoints for there apps.
Yes what I’m trying to do is: Make the program check for rare usernames 24/7 but for the program to be up to date I’ll have to keep updating the mid and csrftoken
You could do a simple calculator, or a minesweeper game!
traffic light, cash register, clipboard history viewer.. anything that kinda sounds cool you can probably do.
If you cant do it through the API it is against the Instagram terms of service. https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/ I am now locking this thread
Going from VB.NET to VB6 is easier than the other way around though. From VB6 to VB.NET entails lots of new features and syntax to learn and understand. From VB.NET back to VB6 though just means that half the time you try to write something you remember that the fancy new library/syntax isn't available to you and you have to do it the old fashioned way. Considering most of us learned to program the old fashioned way, that's not a big deal. If OP knows PHP/JS/Python and either C/C++, they're gonna be pretty familiar with the basic syntax and with writing their own boilerplate.
It really comes down to what OP is comfortable with and it seems like OP is fine with learning it. It could be a good jump to a career.
Thanka and ya i tried getting vb6. Way too much work. And vb.net too mee is kind of like other .net stuff..thanks though
You can pick up a legit copy [on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Visual-Basic-FoxPro-C-Studio-Professional-6-0-6-PRO-Full-Ver-install-info/233175987855?hash=item364a5f368f:g:l~YAAOxy3cJTi-ky#viTabs_0).
So should I first check VBA before VB6? Yes maybe after learning vb6 and VBA I will move to [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) to upgrade our system.
Yes that's what I am doing right now. Reading book while coding simple functions. Thank you for the reply...
Thanks. Though im likely just wait till i jave a place that uses it.
Thank you for the site. It can help me to learn to debug and read codes.
Yes our company still and only using vb6.
Our company only use vb6. Maybe after vb6 I will go to [vb.net](https://vb.net) then c# (Hoping and believing that I can learn to code). Thank you for the reply.
Yes I was able to download some old free books online, now I'm starting reading and coding...
