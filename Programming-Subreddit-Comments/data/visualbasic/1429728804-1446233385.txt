Thanks for your suggestion. Fortunately for me and unfortunately for you I actually managed to get it to work before I saw your reply. However I will keep the Shell command at the back of my mind as I move forward.
I think the problem could be you're declaring CC and CG in a private type declaration.. I would probably declare those at the top of the module as public integers so that CreateCell is reading/writing the values you expect. Edit: I looked at it wrong so ignore what I said about them being declared in a private type.
If this is not the problem, why did it went wrong?
.
No, only a single password? Then this password is checked against the pre-set password in the code. The user will get 3 attempts to enter the password and then it will be locked to stop the user from trying again.
Your loop would run from 1 to gradeNum with each iteration accumulating the new input. Then when the loop finishes you could pass the sum of the accumulated values and the gradeNum to a function where it would divide the two numbers and return the average back to the calling routine. Loop from 1 to total number of grades from first Inputbox 'accumulate each input from the user int a variable gradeValue += InputBox("Enter a grade value") dim AvgGrade = YourFunction(GradeValue, GradeNum) Display AvgGrade Function YourFunction (GradeTotal, numGrades) As Double Return AverageResult from your arguments 
I'm calling this function but it wont run the average, it ends after the exit for. here's the function. Private Sub GetGrades() Dim total As Integer = 0 Dim numbers As String Dim gradeNum As String Dim Average As String gradeNum = InputBox("Enter how many grades you want to input:") For counter As Integer = 1 To CInt(gradeNum) Do numbers = CStr(CDbl(InputBox(" Enter Grades"))) If counter &lt;&gt; CDbl(gradeNum) Then counter = counter + 1 total = CInt(numbers.Count) Else Exit For End If Loop Until CDbl(numbers) = CDbl(gradeNum) If CDbl(numbers) = CDbl(gradeNum) Then Average = CStr((counter / total)) ListBox1.Items.Add(Average) End If Next counter End Sub
You are setting fur and gen on the firstCell object in the Cell constructor (New). You should instead set those fields on the newly created Cell and pass in the Cell properties as arguments. Your Cell structure would look like this: Private Structure Cell 'fur - furtilty gen - generation Public fur As Integer Public gen As Integer Sub New(pfur as Integer, pgen as Integer) fur = pfur gen = pgen End Sub End Structure And then you'd pass those arguments when creating a new Cell, like: Dim ListCells = New List(Of Cell) From {New Cell(2, 1)}
Cheers! This worked, I'm very new to VB and this is a small assignment for a module in my first year, I'll be doing no programming next year so I'm happy just to leave it as it is, again thanks!
Thank you, I had always assumed that it would be something to do with the button press. The only problem is I was told by my lecturer that it need to have some kind of loop in it. I have tried each kind and i still can't get it to work. What /u/programming_error said didn't work either as it just looped without allowing the user to enter a different password. Is a loop possible here? Or will it just continue to cause problems?
SOLVED by scanning for port 8000 (and most importantly, enabling ICMP ping, disabled by default lol)
You aren't going to finish it in time, because honestly there isn't much to what you have already done, and still a whole lot to do. For starters, you only draw the game screen on form.load, and on a keydown event. Literally, if no player moves, the game is frozen and doesn't redraw, bombs don't explode, etc.. Games of this nature are not event driven (well games of this nature aren't typically written in winforms, but that is another story). They are typically timer/loop driven, where you would have a timer that is refreshing and redrawing x times per second, which gives you your "frames per second". Regarding collisions, if you are using rectangles, then you could use the rectangle.intersect method, passing in 2 rectangles to see if there is a collision, but since bomberman is a tile based game where the whole board is just a collection of squares, you could easily just calculate if there would be a collision. For example if the player hits the key to go to the right, you would simply check to see if the square to the right of the player is occupied or not, and if not, move them, otherwise keep them where they are. Anyway, good luck man, but you have a lot of work to do.
&gt; then you could use the rectangle.intersect method if I recall correctly it's Rectangle.IntersectsWith() but as you said, he should represent his grid as an array and look up collision values there. No real collision tests are necessary in this case.
This answer rocks. I appreciate the effort you put into this and helping me become better at programming. B
I am interfacing with activex controls provided by the maker of the program, but unfortunately there are no raised events. I can create an event for when the [isprinting] Boolean is high, but would it be best to just run a seperate thread that has a while loop running while [isprinting] is low, then when it goes high raise a custom event? I am unsure of how to do this, or if it is good programming practice to do the control this way.
Thanks! :)
First of all, thank you for doing this! I got different answers from the message boxes after copying/pasting from the Word document we got the assignment on. [Here's a .txt file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q503tcu2lipv0dn/prequiz.txt?dl=0) so you can see what I wrote and so you can copy/paste. I believe the correct answers given are: 15 1 10 55 5 44 5 20 55 44 5 44
only perform it if lstTarget.Items.Count &gt; 0 Try If lstTarget.Items.Count &gt; 0 then If (lstTarget.items.Count -1 &gt;= intSelectedIndex Then ..... 
I feel dumb. Thanks. 
But I prefer to do the math like this ' 35% If (chkDiscount15.checked = true) and (chkDiscount20.checked = true) then TotalPrice *= .65 Else If chkDiscount15.checked = true then TotalPrice *= 0.85 If chkDiscount20.checked = true then TotalPrice *= 0.80 End if. I just think that math statement is much cleaner than the total - (total * .15) Also I'm on my phone so idk if i applied the discounts correctly or not. Running discount as stated above also works. You can do either. 
I haven't gotten to ASP.net yet, but in my current VB.net course, and also in the Java my teacher/program director has been making us use a log modual procedure that he created in every single procedure in the projects, because every procedure is an important procedure. So i'd recommend using it everywhere out of habit? even if an error can't occur. That's what i've been taught. Anyways, the idea behind it is when an error is encountered by the user and they instantly click ok or whatever, getting rid of the messagebox before they call tech support(with no way to explain it), it'll save the error message and information to a logfile in the program's directory. So when the person calls tech support all you have to do is hope they can find the directory where it's installed, and then have them email you the most recent log file. Here's the code: EDIT: Added it: Public Module modUtilities ' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ' Constants ' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ' What log file should we use Private Const strLOG_FILE_EXTENSION As String = ".Log" ' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ' Properties ' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Private m_strOldLogFilePath As String ' Name of the last log file opened Private m_fsLogFile As FileStream = Nothing ' File handle of the last log file opened ' ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ' ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ' WriteLog ' ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ' ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ' What is WriteLog? It's a procedure that will write an exception or ' string to a disk file. The file is named with the current date using ' yyyymmdd format (so it sorts correctly). The file is created in a Log ' directory off of the current working director (usually where the executable ' was launched from). ' ' Why use WriteLog? Because when, not if, the user gets an error you ' (the programmer) are going to need the error information to be able ' to find and fix the bug in a reasonable period of time. The exception ' will tell you where the error happened and, if you're lucky, why it ' happened. ' ' How to use? Wrap procedure code in a try/catch block and put ' a call to WriteLog in the catch block. You really can't do much else ' at that point because you don't know why the error happened.

That means I have ' to use try/catch block with WriteLog in 100% of my procedures. ' ' Guidelines for try/catch: ' 1) Use in all procedures ' 2) ALL code goes in the try block with two exceptions.

' 3) Do as little as possible in the catch block so that you don't ' cause another exception. ' 4) Use only one try/catch block per procedure. If you expect ' an error then code for it.

Valid point. I need help making a program like this one, it's a movie ticket calculator. But I really have no clue what to do. http://imgur.com/a/htIR5 
Are you doing this in vb.net?
I'm using visual express 2010 if that's what you're asking :/
I assume you're doing this for a project and you can just hard code all the prices and stuff. It looks like you need 5 forms. Form 1 is just three pictureboxes and some labels. It doesn't appear to actually do anything. When they click continue you hide this one and show form two. Form 2 is a bunch of buttons. Are all the movies at the same time and you're picking a movie and a time? If so, you just need to record which movie and time they choose. It's a really odd way to do it though, radiobuttons would make more sense than buttons. If you use radiobuttons, add two groupboxes, one for the movie names and one for times, and then place the radio buttons in the corresponding groupbox. When they click a radiobutton, store the value (the movie name or time). Form 3 is some labels and some number up/down controls. When they click confirm, you need to do some math and record the total for the tickets they want. Form 4 is basically the same thing, with some pictureboxes thrown in. When they click the button to add their selection, you update the labels on the right and store the candy/popcorn/soda totals. Form 5 is just a bunch of labels. When you show this one, you plug in all the totals you've been keeping track of and then add them up to get a total. All the way through, the "previous" button should just hide the current form and show the one before it. The next button hides the current form and shows the next one. So basically previous/next would be me.hide form1.show Replace form1 with the name of the form you want.
I assume you could just assign it by doing something like toolstriplabelname.text = textboxname.text or an easier way would be assigning the text you have in your text box to a string variable and assigning that variable to the toolstrip label. Something like Dim strText As String = "text from textbox" and then toolstriplabelname.text = strText
Yeah, we just started Visual Basic in class but I didn't go. I'm almost done with the assignment though but it sure is hard.
then don't put it in the loop? seriously, this is too abstract to give a definitive response. there's all sorts of use cases for both ways, and performance is rarely a motivator to try to interchange them.
Honestly I wouldn't worry about it. But if you are worried why not write a test to see the speed difference. Also can you write the code both ways? I would imagine the first way is the correct way if that code will execute properly. Really this is a pretty vague question.
This really does not matter in todays code environment. Both are fine and since this all is processed by the CLR there are functionally equivalent.
I got VS 2013 from Microsoft but I can't write [VB in it](http://gyazo.com/71cd213e68700b8dc1a4d9144df3eab1). IDK why. I know I installed Python so I can explain how it got there. Anyway here was the [solution to the problem](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yxjl83onvh8f61i/prequiz4b.jpg?dl=0) that someone posted on the discussion board. Never ever would have figured it out.
I don't know how much coding you're doing yet, but here's a simple guide. File -&gt; New Project -&gt; Visual Basic -&gt; Windows Form Application View -&gt; ToolBox -&gt; All Windows Forms -&gt; Button Double Click the button and it'll take you to the code for it. Then click start, click the button to execute your code. So the button_click event will be a subroutine. To make another one go below the end of that sub and type: public sub &lt;nameofsub&gt; and hit enter, and then you can just call that from the button click event. You can kind of look at the picture of what i originally responded with to show that.
[There's to VB option for me.](http://gyazo.com/c07e3429f2f36ab59f7b7ba76009e3c2)
i thought it would be something as dumb as this. thanks.
Deleted my last comment, hadn't had my coffee yet and looked at the wrong thing, so ignore that. Haven't done VB6 in so many years that I forgot that it's not capable of dealing with local variable names, and has such bad error messages. "name" is reserved since it's part of the form's variables, so you'll have to change the name of the variable: Dim name(6) As String Just use something that's not "name" and you'll be good to go. 
I uninstalled the one I had and now have 'community' whereas before I had 'shell'. [Looks much better now!](https://gyazo.com/fb79492faff876a53a1ca36500c482d0) Ty for the idea.
The error you are getting is becuase you are feeding the location property an Integer instead of a point. Sorry, I should have mentioned that I used a point type instead of an integer to describe the location of the webbrowser control. Dim newBrowser As New WebBrowser newBrowser.Navigate(InputBox("URL")) Me.Controls.Add(newBrowser) newBrowser.Left = 0 newBrowser.Top = 0 newBrowser.Width = 100 newBrowser.Height = 100 Dim newpoint As Point = New Point(100, 100) newBrowser.Location = newpoint The way to set the location of the control without using a point is to use the left,top,width, and height properties of the control. The other way is to create a new point providing it with the values you want, and then set the location via the point. Another way you could approach this is to use the Dock property and have it autosize to the space you give it. Draw a panel on the form on the right side of your form and make it 100 wide. Then do something like this. Dim newBrowser As New WebBrowser newBrowser.Navigate(InputBox("URL")) Panel1.Controls.Add(newBrowser) newBrowser.Left = 0 newBrowser.Top = 0 newBrowser.Height = 200 newBrowser.Dock = DockStyle.Top This will add a new browser control to the top of the panel and shuffle everything else down one space :) Set your Autoscroll property to true on the panel and you now have a scrolling widget container. B
Its really straightforward and clear directions I don't see how you're having trouble understanding what the teacher wants from your project.
For example, he wants us to prompt the users for their information. After prompting for that he then wants us to get them to enter their own grade information?? I feel like I'm misunderstanding it, as it would make more sense to either prompt for their info and then display the grades. Or don't prompt at all and just have them enter the information.
Sounds like a simple Windows Form Application that requires some coding in the backend after making a credible GUI. Start with that, there are many tools you can use to help with the layout of the GUI located in the toolbox with Visual Studio. If you are at this point in the semester and cannot understand these instructions then I think its time to ask for a tutor. 
I think the main problem that most C# developers have with VB is there perception of the old VB6 applications. Vb.Net is a full implementation of the .NET stack. VB programmers can create applications every bit as robust as our C# counterparts. No programming language that has created as many applications as VB has over the years can ever be deprecated in its entirety. There is a great deal of code and too much good will to be lost if they ever do. Having said that I am pushing my new developers to start using javascript more for the client side interface and backend in VB. I for one have written Microsoft and told them about the apps my company has written and explained to them that if they ever did drop VB they would loose me and all of my developers for any new projects. EDIT: For those of you who think that is a bit of sour grapes. I have been programming now for 25 years, I started in Cobol, moved to C, and then C++. I have no troubles with C# syntax, I just think VB is **Better** 
15 year vb6 and vb.net developer checking in. I have no problem with c pound. I've known pure basic since I was a kid. I can develop in c pound, but I prefer vb. It all compiles down to the same runtime. 
I'd say the key part is &gt;allow a student to access current grades Create a table or data points in some database (or even hard coded into the application for now) that the students can read (once logged in to their 'account') and enable editing of the grades if the teacher is logged in. The data you use is made up, but should also be enter-able/editable by the teacher account. Should be relatively straight forward once you get your datasource set up.;)
You cannot modify a list as you are iterating over it. If you do for each x in someList you cannot add or remove elements from someList in the loop. As a workaround, you can use a backward for loop: for i =someList.Count - 1 to 0 step -1 '... here you can add or remove from the end of the list... next Another way is to create a temporary list of elements to add or remove: dim tmpAdd = new list(of ...) dim tmpDel = new list(of ...) for each x in someList tmpAdd.Add(...) tmpDel.Add(...) next someList.AddRange(tmpAdd) for each del in tmpDel someList.Remove(del) next 
Ok, I did the first thing, but I'm having a problem using Index, I do that - For i = ListCells.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1 CreateCell(ListCells.listindex(i)) Next But it says there is a problem with the listindex, am I using it wrong? 
ListCells is a standard List, you can just use ListCells(i) 
There is lots of stuff on google for this, [here is a random page I found](http://www.vb-tips.com/MSHTML.aspx), but it might be a bit old. The concept is the same.
mind = blown lol Thanks for the help! I'll check back incase I run into any problems, i'll try the code later since I have to sleep now (timezones lol).
Hey. How are the name and score saved in the array? is it a 2d array or two 1d arrays? I'm having a bit of trouble understanding your code snippet.
I've heard really good things about Beautiful Soup though it is a Python library and not .Net http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ 
I tried working something else, which didn't work either: &lt;code&gt; Private Function GiveAmountMeals() As Integer Dim totalmeals As Integer = 0 For i As Integer = 0 To meals.GetUpperBound(0) If Me.lstMeal.SelectedItem = True then totalmeals = totalmeals + 1 End if Next End function &lt;/code&gt; But apparently this is not the correct way to do it, since it only gives me 0's. I think i'm supposed to use a return function, but no idea how to make this work. It would be easy in console programming, sadly.. haha
which part isn't working? can you just list the files? can you send emails using that function without a file? I don't see any error handling, are you getting errors? some errors do not raise an error, but just present a status
In the Save sub, how are you saving the yes/no for the meal selection? Edit: I see in the code in your other reply that you are not returning a value for the function, so it will always be 0. You need a Return totalmeals on the line before End Function. This tells the code what the value of the function is when it exits. 
This will keep counting whatever is currently selected in the meal listbox, not what you had saved from other people.
Okay, I've played around with it and it's a little messy but it works well. If you're just using a 2d array, saving it is easy, you use the split() and join() commands like so: Dim SaveString as string SaveString = Join(Array(),",") IO.file.writealltext("Savefilelocation\save.txt",SaveString) This will save the Array as a comma seperated file, but you can use any symbol. To load after this, you use Split() after reading in the file. Dim SaveString as string = IO.file.readalltext("Savefilelocation\save.txt") Array() = Split(SaveString,",") Now, if you want to use a 2d array, the code is a little more complicated, I wrote and tested the code in VB, and you can download that here: [http://pastebin.com/5gxW8tij](http://pastebin.com/5gxW8tij). Just make a new console project and replace the default code with that. Obviously it will work with forms as well. I'll go through it here though: So first for the example I've populated a 2d array with 3 entries. In Saves(3,2) the first dimension, with an upperbound of 3 denotes the 3 different players, whilst the 2nd dimension denotes whether we're looking at the score, or the player name. So in the code it's this: Scores(1, 1) = "10" Scores(1, 2) = "Frank" Scores(2, 1) = "20" Scores(2, 2) = "Jim" Scores(3, 1) = "30" Scores(3, 2) = "Bob" **SAVING:** Now that we have it populated, we cycle through the two bounds, joining the two values of each player with a comma, and each individual player with a colon. Dim savestr As String ' Cycle through the x value For x = 1 To UBound(Scores, 1) ' Cycle through the y value For y = 1 To UBound(Scores, 2) 'Write the user score to the string, then the user name savestr += Scores(x, y) 'if this isn't the last time round, ammend a comma to seperate the two values If y &lt; UBound(Scores, 2) Then savestr += "," Next 'We've written the details for one user, so add a colon if this isn't the last time round to seperate from the next user If x &lt; UBound(Scores, 1) Then savestr += ":" Next Then we write this to the save file: IO.File.WriteAllText(userprofile &amp; "\desktop\save.txt", savestr) Where userprofile is a variable with the user's profile **Loading:** Now we have a save file that looks like: *10,Frank:20,Jim:30,Bob* we need to load it, to do this I used the split function with two temporary arrays, it's sort of lazy but efficient too, assuming you don't mind using a little bit, albeit unoticable, more memory. 'Read in the save file Dim savestr As String = IO.File.ReadAllText(userprofile &amp; "\desktop\save.txt") Dim TemporaryArray() As String = Split(savestr, ":") 'TemporaryArray is now a 1D array with the following values: ' 1] 10,Frank ' 2] 20,Jim ' 3] 30,Bob For x = 1 To UBound(NewScores, 1) For y = 1 To UBound(NewScores, 2) Dim TemporaryArray2() As String = Split(TemporaryArray(x - 1), ",") 'TemporaryArray2 now contains: '1] 10 '2] Frank NewScores(x, y) = TemporaryArray2(y - 1) 'We have the -1 because the TemporaryArray is 0 based, unlike the Scores array Next Next This reads in the file, splits it by colon into the individual players, then splits that 1D array by comma to get the two values. In the example I used in the pastebin link I read the values into a second array NewScores() but you will probably be reading it into the same one. I hope you can make sense of this, if not I'll try to help explain it further!
Wow thank you, I did not expect someone to actually write the code for me, but sort of guide me to try to come up with the right one.Well I guess reddit is not a teacher. Nevertheless, thank you very much, I shall use this later, but now I am currently caught up with exam practise as sadly the season's upon me :( .Anyway thank you again kind stranger!
This is my code in the btnSave_Click sub right now, problem is, I don't know how many inputs the user will make so the code has to be dynamic. " Private Sub btnSave_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSave.Click Dim i As Integer If passengers Is Nothing Then i = 0 Else i = passengers.GetUpperBound(0) + 1 End If ReDim Preserve passagiers(i) ReDim Preserve maaltijden(i) passagiers(i) = "Name" maaltijden(i) = True Me.FillPassengersSummary() Me.RemoveInput() End Sub "
I see... you just used what I had as an example. No worries. What you have will save the name "Name" and meal=true for each passenger, no matter what is typed in. To save the name that is typed in, use passagiers(i) = Me.txtPassenger.Text (Change 'txtPassenger' to whatever your textbox is named.) The .Text property will get the value that is typed in to the textbox. For the meals, you can do something similar. (I assume you have a combo box to choose between yes/no) Again, the .Text property will give the text that is selected in the combo box. You can do: maaltijden(i) = (Me.lstMeals.Text = "Yes") This will save 'True' if you select 'Yes'. A longer version would be: If Me.lstMeals.Text = "Yes" then maaltijden(i) = True Else maaltijden(i) = False End If 
bump
Looks like they want you to clear &amp; refill the list every time. So you would blank the box at the start of FillPassengersSummary: me.txtPassengersInfo.Text = "" Then loop though and add all of the passengers and meals (similar to what's in the GiveAmountMeals function). Kind of like the line you have now, but adding each line from the arrays and not the textboxes. After the loop, you would add the line to give the total meals. (My first instinct is to just write the code, but I'm trying to just point you in the right direction, because you seem willing to learn. Let me know if my hints are just confusing :) ) 
I should've thought of that first code part, damnit lol. That does make sense, however when I implement this, i'm now getting this: http://i.imgur.com/NKk8X9q.png No idea what's going on right now
EDIT: Nevermind I found out why! I accidently deleted this line: Me.txtPassagiersInfo.Text = ""
Thanks alot for the help, I really appreciate it, learned alot thanks to this excercise &amp; your help!
Do you have your nodes in a graph structure? The algorithm is pretty straightforward once you have a good representation of your graph... Your nodes need a "visited" flag, a value and a list of neighbors. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) has a good description of the steps to follow. It'd be easier to help you if we had a better idea of the code you have right now or what you've tried. 
Do you remember what those questions were? 
Don't feel bad about oDesk, and certainly do not let it slow you down. I work with Human Resource companies a lot these days. They need to have quantifiable information. Testing is the easiest way to get that data. Realistically knowing what the hell is going on inside the .NET runtime, and all its features are maybe about 10% of your job. When I test for new programmers, I put them in front of google and ask them to find information about whatever is floating my boat that day. Then I ask them to explain what they know vs what is in the searches (It has been about XML serialization and deserialization as of late). Then we discuss the pro's and cons of implementations. I look for interest, passion and down right tenacity. Good programmers are passionate about what they do. They get better everyday. A test can't capture that. Just so you know the last certification I held was MSCD for .Net 2, I found it useless other than to put in on my business card. I spent 2 days memorizing the answers from a book, I then wrote the test and passed. I have looked at your code before, and I know you are working at becoming better at your craft Your code is organized well and it solves the problem presented. Be passionate about programming, write great software, and show that to employers, clients, everybody. The concepts will come as you write software and you will "Understand" .NET not a bunch of facts that are not connected in your head. Here are some thoughts on working areas of knowledge. **Interface** * Winforms - Will be around for the foreseeable future. Just becuase there is so much legacy stuff out there. * WPF- Not a fan myself but having a basic understanding is going to help in the long run. * Webforms - is slowly dieing out being replaced by MVC * MVC - Have a working knowledge. The model View Controler idea while being closer to how the underpinnings of how the web works, is way too complicated for its own good. I find that MVC apps are just a pain to manage long term. * HTML5, Javascript interfaces for client side and use .Net for backend. This is how my company is approaching apps these days. Limit round trips is the most important concept. Do as much as you can on the client and then make small packages to submit to the server (postback) * Telerik/DevExpress - Most commonly used control set for .net application development. **Database** * Learn how to take any data source, and make it work in .Net http://www.connectionstrings.com/ * Learn SQL not MSsql, not Oracle SQL or whatever DB you happen to need. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SQL you can always learn platform specific weirdness. Understand the base language. * Stored Procedures - writing a function for data manipulation is ALWAYS faster at the database level than doing it on the web server or client. * LINQ To SQL - need to be able to get data easy and fast without a lot of code &lt;--- * Use an ORM tool. This kinda fits across a few different areas. Reality is automate the crappy parts of your job. Writing data classes sucks. I like the telerik one (Free) http://www.telerik.com/data-access but there are lots out there. Microsoft Entity Framework is commonly used becuase it is baked in. it sucks. **Programming** * Microsoft reporting still the most commonly used reporting system. Again this is because it is baked in... * XML/JSON Serialization and Deserialization * Http request model and page lifecycles * Javascript interactions with .Net * programmatically creating controls on the fly. in the long run when you are being data entry forms from a relation map, being able to create the form automagically will make your life a lot easier. This list will grow. I tried to google a broad list of topic areas and got crap for return, maybe we can create one here. B 
thank you for that, the main issue I'm facing however is how to find all of the paths the route could take in order to get from the start node to the end node as there are multiple neighbours for each node, any advice on that? 
Thanks a lot. This is a lot to chew on and I am excited to get started. Sometimes, when I go too long between communicating with actual programmers in the field, the internet makes me question if I am making the right decisions. 
In regards to auto properties you professor is wrong any extra code you wrote is one more chance for a bug to enter so the less code the better. The new async functionality in .net will make life a lot easier ands it a good skill to have. I'm not a big commenter personally, I much prefer self documenting code. Though I do make a habit of commenting all public methods and properties with XML comments it makes life a lot easier and if you've already written the contents it's not extra work. For a beginners project though it's really good no major faults just an obvious lack of experience but not in a bad way.
Add **unit testing** to this list. I think I am going to start a wiki page on this sub :) 
I am all for that!
There are a ton of useful classes in the System.IO namespace that you can use. They will allow you to open, edit, save, create, delete, etc... any file that is supported by the class. .cfg files are essentially just glorified .txt files, so opening them in .NET is as straightforward as it can be.
Yes, but you'll have to write the code in the drop event to handle it. You should be able to get the location of the control in the drop event, and then just do some math there to decide which location it should be dropped at (so if you have a 10*10 grid, you'd move the control to the closest multiple of 10, rounding up or down as you see fit). 
 Hope this will help. Imports System.Xml Dim StuffToSave As String = "Hello World" ' Get from textbox Dim SelectedFolder As String = "F:\" ' Get this from FolderDialog Dim SaveLocation As String = "B:\School" ' Get this from FolderDialog Dim xmlsetting As New Xml.XmlWriterSettings xmlsetting.Indent = True Dim writer As Xml.XmlWriter = Xml.XmlWriter.Create("backup.xml", xmlsetting) ' * "backup.xml" - Change path to Location to Save XML With writer .WriteStartDocument() .WriteComment("XML Database.") .WriteStartElement("Data") .WriteStartElement("Backup") .WriteStartElement("BackupName") .WriteString(StuffToSave) .WriteEndElement() .WriteStartElement("SelectedFolder2Backup") .WriteString(SelectedFolder) .WriteEndElement() .WriteStartElement("SaveLocation") .WriteString(SaveLocation) .WriteEndElement() .WriteEndElement() .WriteEndElement() .Close() End With https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlwriter(v=vs.110).aspx

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager%28v=vs.110%29.aspx This is basically all you need for reading .config files in .Net, anything else and you'll have to write your own. I'd probably just write a dictionary to file. Or one of the many configuration libraries out there. http://nugetmusthaves.com/Tag/configuration
I can not stress this enough. Problem solving not code writing.
I had a similar issue recently. The way I got around it was creating a module to hold all the global variables. You can then reference them on your forms: GlobalVariableModule.Variable = somevariable

I've already started ignoring a good deal of the homework questions where the poster obviously isn't even trying. It's also really annoying to find that the OP also deletes the post later (I'm assuming in fear of being caught by a classmate or teacher).
I wonder if there is a way for us to set it so only mods can delete threads? 
I would first implore you to set Option Strict On at the top of your code but I'm afraid it would only cause you a lot of stress with some of the other issues in your code where you are using implicit conversions of various types. Without seeing the types involved between the two I can only state that for some reason the DataBoundItem is not of the same type between the two segments of code. You might be able to cast this explicitly by changing that line to: Dim rowItem As MasterDataSet.CustomerSuppliersRow = CType(selectedrow(0).DataBoundItem, MasterDataSet.CustomerSuppliersRow ) But I'm unsure if it would even let you explicitly cast it. Either way, DataBoundItem is a generic object that could hold a datarow or a datarowview or some other type and in this case it's different from the type that it holds in the second code block. If you were to add a MsgBox(TypeName(selectedrow(0).DataBoundItem)) in each code segment you should see that there is something different about the two "rows" 
What framework are you using? WPF, Winforms? I highly recommend that you do not use global variables they are evil things and you should stay away from them whenever possible. http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil Presumably you have to open the new form somehow, like when clicking a button or something along those lines? So when you create your new form you can just pass the data to the new form. So I imagine something like this 'You can pass it in the constructor Dim secondForm as new Form(&lt;&lt;Patient GUID&gt;&gt;) ' You can set a property on the form secondForm.PatientGuid = &lt;&lt;Patient GUID&gt;&gt; 'You can call a method on the form secondForm.SetPatientInformation(&lt;&lt;Pass Patient Info containing Guid&gt;&gt;) secondForm.SetPatientGUID(&lt;&lt;PatientGUID&gt;&gt;) There are literally tonnes of better ways to pass this data then using a global variable. 
Thanks for the advice, I am using Winforms, the admission data is entered first (to prevent users accessing the observations screed without admitting anyone) at which point the GUID is generated and entered in the "Patient" database. Passing it when opening the observation form shouldn't be too much of a hassle. Can I ask a follow up? If global variables are bad, what is the best way to store variables that contain connection strings and the like? On my machine I've got a SQL server running so I can code the connection string without issue. Later on I was planning on having an option to select a new server location and store that as a string. I'm guessing this is also a no no? (I should probably point out I'm not a programmer, just an enthused hobbiest)
ditto. I shy from homework help when I don't know what the details are. it's also impossible to give a good answer without knowing what the previous work was. sometimes the Right Answer for homework is a completely asinine solution that you'd never do in the real world. The teacher is leading you down a path and building on previous assignments and you don't yet have the info for the proper solution, and so the proper solution would be wrong in this case. you almost certainly will get marked off points, if not an F, for having too advanced a solution.
In he case of connection strings those should be stored in a configuration file that way you can change the value without recompiling your code. It's almost going to be like a global variable but it's a config file there is a difference. You can take a look at the [System.Configuration Namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) in particular the [ConfigurationManager class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager(v=vs.110).aspx). Personally I've been meaning too look at [Formo](https://github.com/ChrisMissal/Formo) to handle configs it looks interesting. You might want to check that out. So while the connection string would be stored in a config file it would be handled by your Data Access Layer (DAL). So your DAL reads the connections strings from the config file and it handles opening and closing connections as well as performing queries against your database. That way nothing else needs to care about what DB you are using. If you do forsee a scenario where you can connect to multiple DB's while the app is running then for sure expose it as a setting otherwise I'd just store it in the config file. Something to think about is that you'll also want to look at some way of securing that connection string since it will allow anyone to save data to the db. Let me know if you have any questions this is essentially the exact same type of stuff I do everyday for a living. 
You're syntax is incorrect here if I'm not mistaken - I don't have a vb compiler around to test, so keep that in mind: Let gradeValue = If(Grade = "A", 4, If(Grade = "B", 3, If(Grade = "C", 2, If(Grade = "D", 1, 0)))) it should be **IIF(Grade = "A" ...** Let gradeValue = IIf(Grade = "A", 4, If(Grade = "B", 3, If(Grade = "C", 2, If(Grade = "D", 1, 0))))

The only thing I can think of is that the PID has changed. If you have multiple windows of Excel open it can have multiple PIDS and in theory could cause it the not "find" the process. Secondly I would create a watch class that you pass the name of the application you want to watch and monitors by processid not name. 
Okay do not define your queries as strings either look into an form like Entity Framework, Dapper dot net or the like. It will make your life so much as easier and your app more secure. Read up on "little bobby tables" to see why storing SQL as strings is bad. Also parameterized queries.

I didn't not have name declared. If I declare name publicly am I able to still have the variable supplied via inputBox? Like this: http://i.imgur.com/lUHBGdz.png
I dont have experience with Visual Basic but I do know the concepts you can implement. I learned these in C and Perl programming. options: 1. Use a pointer variable 2. Use a global variable 3. Use a return statement. 1. A pointer is a variable that uses the address of a variable to send the value and address of the variable to a seperate function. Careful though, changing a pointers value can change its value in multiple functions. 2. Global variables are declared early/at the top of a program. These variables are useable by all functions and namespaces. 3. Return the variable at the end of the function. If you want the variable to be used after the function has run. say: return Name End Sub in your main function you would then call Game_Load and store its returned value in a local variable inside of main: returnedVar = Game_Load() I would also reccomend the option of creating a local variable inside Main. Then passing the variable as a parameter to each function you want to have access to the variable. &gt;Edit: The code snippets are in Visual Basic from resources I found online. &gt;Returning a value: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1wey3ak2.aspx &gt;Pointers: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/712/How-to-do-pointers-in-Visual-Basic &gt;Global Variables: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529862/declare-global-variables-in-visual-studio-2010-and-vb-net
Those are great links. Though I've probably shot myself in the foot with one aspect of the program. When the program starts, it validates the database. If the database is missing, it runs through a number of SQL files to regenerate the database. So far, these files have been hand crafted, lovingly, by me, over many many hours. Just thinking out loud here now. I could probably import them into a table from the csv files, and then use a tool to generate a script for the table afterwards. That might be the quickest way to do it.
What are you using these names for?
not like that, no. I'd recommend against that anyway. put the assignment in game_load or use the constructor.
Thank you so much, I'll look into what you have suggested. The messagebox was just me trying to figure out why the database wasn't updating properly, had added it for troubleshooting. May I ask - what the "Implements" and the "Interface" bits mean - I haven't come across them before. 
Interface is a contract that objects implement basically if you have an interface with a method Foo anything that implements that interface has to have the method Foo. I'll post an example for why its useful after I have finish cooking dinner. 
Think of it this way instead of the output of an iteration being a letter use the names from your list of first and last names or you can use parts of names to generate real looking names. So Jo, ste, chri, ve, hn, could be states and it would output names like. Jove, Steve, Chrive, John, Stohn. Still random but plausable, or you could have names and titles be the states so it outputs stuff like Lieutenant Commander John Smith III
The main benefits of a pointer is that you can pass variables to other functions, change a variable's value from a different function and most importantly access the variable's address. Addresses are important in systems programming and memory allocation. I wouldnt say there is no reason to use a pointer.
This one is fun: https://randomuser.me/
Instead of CSV or a database, why not a simple text file? Use ReadLine to create a list of first names and a list of last names, randomly pick from both, and blam! Random name. 
Since I'm already using a database, why not utilize it?
The application itself doesn't, the launcher does though. But all that does is check for updates.
Alright I promised I'd get to interfaces after dinner well you had to wait until I finished installing a door in my bedroom. So Interfaces are as I said a contract that your classes implement. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/28e2e18x.aspx So in the example earlier you had a Database object (I'll call DAL because it's easier for me since that's what we use at work), and it had a method called Public Sub AddMember(Anaes_name As String, Anaes_GMC As Integer, IsActive As Integer) So without interfaces your class that has a reference to the DAL could only ever have a reference to that object. If you make it implement an interface you can swap out any old object that implements that interface. So for example lets assume the class that calls the database gets passed an instance of that database from whatever makes that class. So without interfaces it looks something like this. Public Class DBCallee private _dal as Dal Public Sub New(dal as DAL) _dal = dal End Sub Public Sub MakeDBCall() _dal.AddMember("name", 1234, 1) End Sub End Class So anytime you call MakeDBCall it will *always* make a call to the database because that's all it can do. But lets say you want to test to make sure that MakeDBCall actually calls the method **_dal.AddMember** but you don't want to bother with having a database instance running well to do that you use interfaces. So we make our DAL implement an interface. The interface looks like this: 'In .Net the naming convention is all interfaces start with I Interface IDAL Sub AddMember(Anaes_name as String, Anaes_GMC as Integer, IsActive as Integer) End Interface So anything that implements that Interface must have a method called AddMember with those parameters, if you specify a class implements IDAL and it doesn't implement AddMember you'll get a compiler error. So then your DAL is implemented like so Public Class DAL Implements IDAL Public Sub AddMember(Anaes_name as String, Anaes_GMC as Integer, IsActive as Integer) Implements IDAL.AddMember End Sub End Class Now you can have a second class let's call it FakeDAL it looks like this Public Class FakeDAL Implements IDAL Public Sub AddMember(Anaes_name as String, Anaes_GMC as Integer, IsActive as Integer) Implements IDAL.AddMember MsgBox.Show(String.Format("AddMember(Name: {0},GMC: {1},IsActive: {2})", Anaes_name, Anaes_GMC, IsActive)) End Sub End Class So now we make one small change to the DBCallee class it now looks like this: Public Class DBCallee private _dal as IDal Public Sub New(dal as IDAL) _dal = dal End Sub Public Sub MakeDBCall() _dal.AddMember("name", 1234, 1) End Sub End Class So now we can pass the FakeDAL or the real DAL both to the DBCallee class and it doesn't care whcih. Now you may be saying what the hells the point of this I'm only ever going to call the database, well it ends up making your code less coupled so you can make a change to the Database and the rest of the app won't care, you can have an app that saves to a db, one that saves to a server, one that saves to a file, one that doesn't save at all and all you have to do is write new classes that implement IDAL. It also and this is the most important part allows you to test your DBCallee class using automated tests. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation Which is something that's really handy if you were to ever make a job of it and might be handy if you ever want to actually use your app for anything critical. Here is an example using .NetFiddle https://dotnetfiddle.net/oeA8ye
Lighter downloads and no database to manage vs not taking an external dependency, I don't envy you having to make that decision.
Thanks a ton! Very in depth response. I believe I got my problem all wrapped up now. I surly learned a lot from this question! :D
Possible approach: Create variables for each of the coin types. When you click the buttons, you increment those variables, then you call a Sub that updates the total. To increment the variables, you need to do either "var = var + X" or "var += X"... Doing "var = +X" sets the var to X, it doesn't increment. (It's like doing "var = -X" to set it to a negative value). 
Use the Tag property of the label to hold the count
You only need VBA, so /r/excel or /r/vba might be better places in the future. Here is some code to loop through files in a directory: Sub shit Const INFILEPATH As String = "u:\directory\" Const INFILEFILTER As String = "*.xls?" Dim lstrInFileName As String lstrInFileName = Dir(INFILEPATH &amp; INFILEFILTER) Do While lstrInFileName &lt;&gt; "" 'open file, do stuff, close and save file lstrInFileName = Dir Loop end sub Let me know if this helps.
Global Variables don't work the way you described. The closest equivalent to a global is a shared public variable on an object or module. 
^ This. Their are harder ways to do it, if you want but this is easy and clean

Edit: I just realised that the example that I typed below uses the same code. It seems to work for me. So perhaps the error comes up in response to your WebRequest.Create and not the DownloadString.

The second one is better because it's easier to read, but both should compile to the same thing. In the first, you're saying, "create a variable called 'workstream' that's going to be a StreamReader, but keep it empty for now... OK, line 2. Now we're going to make a new StreamReader and assign it to the 'workstream' variable." In the second, you're simply straight out saying, "create a new variable called 'workstream' and assign a new StreamReader object to it." However, some older programming paradigms tell you that you should declare all your variables at the top first, so some people end up using the first syntax because that's what they were trained to do.
thanks for that, so simply put it there is no real reason for it other than some legacy reason. I feel like they could just get rid of the 'New' as long as object is defined at the same time. example workstream = StreamReader(filename) Then again I am thinking small term. I am sure there is a reason why you would want to define the file at one stage, then open the stream in a much later stage.
This is all about style. I find the first to be more syntaxial clear, meaning it is easy for people who come after me to understand the intent. The second is easier to to read, and my prefered method. Remember, no wrong way to code only better ways.
If you have a commonly called routine with your workstream being declared outside of it, you can check to see if it is nothing in the routine and then create it if necessary.
What you could do is set a case statement if you'd like to hard code it. Set it so that there is a var such as picture number and each time you click next it will add one and then run the case to choose which picture corresponds to the var. You can also make a back button that is -= 1 for the var. Other option is to use an array that can set each picBox to a number. So the array will go 0 to 3 and each picBox has a number. If currentPic (user var) = 0 then set picture picBox0 = my.Resources.picture1.
Someone please tell me how stupid this idea is. First of all, you'll need a text file containing all the words you'll want to check against. Pull the data and put them in a list that we'll call OED (Oxford English Dictionary; yes, even though it's a list). Now we start scrambling the input letters! ... something which I have no idea where to even begin doing. I'm gonna think on this a little and edit my post when I get some ideas. But is this plan of attack stupid? The idea is that you scramble the letters into as many possible combinations as possible, then compare them against the OED. Seems very resource-intensive to me, but also seems the most comprehensive.
Well, as your intuition tells you, it is an inefficient way to do it. Think of ways to add more structure. Is a list this best way to hold the dictionary? Can you do a better job of using the letters than simply scrambling them? Start from where you're at, and make incremental changes. If you want some more hints, I can tell you which two data structures I would use for this problem :)
I know what a global variable is they aren't constants and I've never heard of public variable. The reason they aren't constants is because Constants never change after compile, variables can change. You can have global variables but global constants are different.
I see that you've got the connection string hard-coded in app.config. I'm a web guy so I don't know much about standalone apps. Instead, is there a way for you to check from a universal location (like C:\ConnectionString.config) first and then fall back on app.config? That way I don't have make a change to your source code. Also is there sample sql data that goes along with the project?
I'd like to add a second request for a subset of the SQL data, or at least the table definitions.
I was reading and there are no global variables in Visual Basic. Still doesnt exclude the fact that other languages implement them effectively. PHP, Perl, C all have global variables. The point is This guy needed to use a variable inside a function in another function. Best way to do that would be to declare it in Main and pass it to all the functions that need it.
 its all good man. No judgement here. Happens to all of us. 
For the case problem, I think that in your For loop for the skill level. intNum always has the same value, which meant that it was saving into the last player's index over and over again. 
hmm, I'm using your Github code and when I run it, the Career tackles seem to be fine. Did you happen to change something after you posted the code? I found that you have enter a valid name (from the array of players) for the thing to work - otherwise it returns the careers total of the first player's. 
Yeah, No worries, I am new myself, But I usually troubleshoot my problems pretty quickly.

Meaning "help desk.vb" is bad. use Help_desk.vb if you must or use the standard convention HelpDesk.vb **o** Use folders to make your structure easier to manage. Place all your classes in a single structure. **o** [Namespaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt9tafza.aspx), and [regions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sd032a17.aspx) are your friend **o** Store your connection string in your application settings. This will make sure you can change your database connection in a single place making it available application wide. Retrieve it using something like this Dim Connection As New SqlConnection(my.settings.connectionstring) **o** in the login form function you are checking to see if they have anything in them using. If txtPW.Text.Count &gt; 0 And txtUser.Text.Count &gt; 0 Then it is more common to use [IsNullOrEmpty](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.isnullorempty.aspx) If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(txtPW.Text) And String.IsNullOrEmpty(txtUser.Text) Then ... **o** Use functions to make your code easier to follow and to reduce replicated code. **o** you should always pass connections into classes. Never have a class use an out of scope variable or pull from the settings of the application. This creates what has been affectionately called spaghetti code :) I will go further if you fix the Git repo and let us have your DB scripts to create the test data. Just for my knowledge what level of schooling is this? 
you are correct hardcode = bad :) 
If you could have any one food for the rest of your life, what would it be and why is it spaghetti?
username is relevant! UpBoats everywhere! 
I get what you are doing with this but remote process stuff is hard to make behave because the user logged in on the machine processing the code must have administrative rights on the remote machine to get it to work right. I would suggest that you just create an app on the remote machine that has a webpage that you can view from wherever and then you are working directly on the machine. 
With VB .NET Being the ONLY Language I'm Moderately good at (python doesn't count does it?), I always Get an Idea of what I'm doing and then Create the GUI, Saving the Code for Later. Now That I am re-reading your "Rant?" Is it safe to assume you hate that he is Going straight for WinForms, and not Console app(s)?
Whilst I agree with everything you say, I do think there needs be somewhat of a balance between the two when someone begins programming in any language from square 0. Eventually both the code side and the interface are going to be learnt, but I have to say I agree that the code side should take priority if it were to be one of the two to start with.
&gt; He was teaching programming from VB which I have no issues with but he was teaching them via creating forms and interfaces first before he was teaching them how to program. That's how we usually create programs in real life. UI first, show the customer, then add the guts.
Do you find that mostly you create mockups of forms, then you figure out the backend and how you are going to store and manipulate the information before you write the connecting code?
Can't argue with balance. Let's face it every developer needs to be able to have a method to get and show information to a user. Part of this is the abstraction of the interface needs to be more clear. a lot of programmers when they come to work for me don't understand interface vs the code that does the work. If a program has a good object structure behind the scenes it does not matter what interface I use weather it is a web, console, winforms, MVC or any other interface.
visual basic...clue is in the name.
Ideally we have designers do the mockups in a drawing program, but some annoying customers insist on us doing it all in HTML. That tends to cost a lot more.
Seriously dude, that's what you have to add to the conversation...
Hey! That's brilliant!! I like it! 
Which code snippet do you want, the one I said in the title? &gt; AddressOf(Function(WITH_PARAMETERS))? Or the one I said in the context? &gt; AddressOf(Function) &gt; But with params..? Want me to name them too? ....AddressOf(Function1(Param1)) http://i.imgur.com/X0mH9tm.png &lt;&lt; Snippet screenshot
Figured it out: _thread1 = New Thread(New ParameterizedThreadStart(AddressOf Function1)) _thread1.Start(30)
I learnt VB.NET using a bunch of online tutorials mainly focused on WinForms, which meant that some of my early programs had repeated code and hidden labels which stored variables. Therefore, I agree with the point that it's important to learn how to define variables, subs, functions and the basics of the language (using a console application) before moving onto WinForms and WPF. 
Hi, so from my understanding. You know what the stat is but don't know where to store it/add it to the total value. But you probably don't want to use a Select Case because there are way too many cases(stats) to manually type. In that case, I think a 2D Array could be used. (0,0) -&gt; "Dex" (0,1) -&gt; Value of Dex (1,0) -&gt; "Crit" (1,1) -&gt; Value of Crit ... and so on Where, from your previous loop, you would loop through the 2D array to find the index(location) where the stat name is stored and then add to value in according to that index. If the stat name is not found after the loop, you would create a new index. After the loop is finished, you would loop through the 2D array and get value of each stat's name from (x,0) and each stat's value from (x,1). Note - this is probably not the most efficient way to do this. 
Ok, I never touched Console, But then again, I never took a Class, I download VB .NET One day after wanting to create my own application, and Watched YT Tuts, and learned as I went missing about 99% of the basic's, so I will probably catch up on that soon, Any Advice? (besides TheNewboston, on youtube) and Yeah, I'm only just introduced to Python but I *Love* it already.
&gt; You know what the stat is but don't know where to store it/add it to the total value. Kinda. I know that Dexterity exists in the game, but you don't know whether an item will actually have Dexterity on it, a lot don't. That is why I was thinking if there was a way to pull the stats automatically, 1 by 1 as it checks each item. I don't even know how I would begin to search the object for a value name, that might not exist on that item. The array did sound like something I was looking for - I just don't know how to get that data into the array.
Your "miles", "gallons", "totalmiles", "totalgallons" variables are never set to any value, so they are all zero. You need to assign values to them before doing the calculations. "NaN", by the way, stands for "Not a Number" because zero divided by zero is undefined.
How do i assign values?
There nothing in Visual Basic that prevents teaching "good" programming techniques. If anything, it's because VB makes it too easy to create forms and dump all the code in them that it has acquired a bad reputation. Since it's so easy to produce crappy programs (from an architecture standpoint), there are a lot of them and a lot of people conclude that VB = crappy code by clueless beginners. That's why it would be important for teachers using VB (or any other language) to start from solid bases. When civil engineers get their first course, I'm pretty sure they don't give them a box of popsicle sticks with and a pot of glue and tell them "ok, build a bridge". Telling people who have never programmed before "here's a form, throw some buttons on it and code whatever you need to make it work" is pretty similar in approach. So why does that end up as part of a curriculum and not the other?
Where you do: milesListBox.Items.Add(MilesDrivenTextbox.Text) you can modify it to do: milesListBox.Items.Add(MilesDrivenTextbox.Text) miles = CDbl(MilesDrivenTextbox.Text) totalmiles = totalmiles + miles ...and the same process for gallons.
Ok, here is it. Not the most elegant approach, but fairly simple and fast. The only "clever" part, if I may be so bold, is to iterate integers and use the set bits to select letter combinations. Sub Main ' LINQPad 4.55 ' Internal dictionary: we sort each word and use that as the key. ' the value is a list of words made from those letters. ' ex: key=abet, words=abet,bate,beat,beta dim words As string() = IO.File.ReadAllLines("words.txt") dim dic = new Dictionary(of string, List(of string)) for each word in words dim srt = string.concat(word.orderBy(function(c) c)) if dic.containsKey(srt) then dic(srt).add(word) else dic.add(srt, new List(Of String) from {word}) end if next ' we get our input and sort it dim letters = input.split(" "c).toList letters.sort dim elems = letters.toArray ' Now we find the words ' To do so, we will generate bits and use that to select letters from the candidates. ' This is a bit inefficient; the original problem specified the word length required, ' so we went through only once. Runs in about a tenth of a second anyway, ' so good enough. :) dim found = new list(of string) for num = letters.count to 0 step -1 dim combos = new hashset(of string) for i = cint(2^num-1) to cint(2^elems.count-1) - cint(2^(elems.count-num)-1) 'ex: 00000111 to 11100000 if BitCount(i) = num then dim comb = "", bit = 1 for j = 0 to elems.count-1 If (i And bit) = bit Then comb &amp;= elems(j) bit += bit next combos.add(comb) end if next for each c in combos if dic.containsKey(c) then found.addRange(dic(c)) next if found.count &gt; 20 then exit for next found.take(20).dump ' .Dump is LINQPad magic, replace with iteration and console.write as required... End Sub function BitCount(num as integer) as integer ' num &gt;= 0 only dim ret = 0 ret = (num and &amp;H55555555) + ((num &gt;&gt; 1) and &amp;H55555555) ret = (ret and &amp;H33333333) + ((ret &gt;&gt; 2) and &amp;H33333333) ret = (ret and &amp;H0F0F0F0F) + ((ret &gt;&gt; 4) and &amp;H0F0F0F0F) ret = (ret and &amp;H00FF00FF) + ((ret &gt;&gt; 8) and &amp;H00FF00FF) ret = (ret and &amp;H0000FFFF) + ((ret &gt;&gt; 16) and &amp;H0000FFFF) return ret end function function input as string return &lt;![CDATA[ w g d a s x z c y t e i o b ]]&gt;.Value.Trim end function

I use PowerPoint for wireframing, I like Balsamiq but I find that powerpoint works just as well, I also find it easier to mockup custom items on the page versus balsamiq. Microsoft is also pushing Powerpoint for wireframing with the addition of the Storyboarding addon that comes with VS Professional.
Putting data in the app.config is not hardcoding. It's a config file, that's were you are supposed to put that stuff. 
**Assignments.vb** Why are you creating private member variables that are only used in one method they should be declared in the Assignments_Load method. Line 21: You are creating a new instance of DataTable and then you are overwriting it with a datatable that is returned from sqlbot.returnDataTable in the next line. You are doing the same thing for TableOfTickets which is declared as a member variable You absolutely need to use parameterized SQL Queries http://stackoverflow.com/questions/542510/how-do-i-create-a-parameterized-sql-query-why-should-i What you are doing is very very dangerous and should not be done. Why are you only displaying the string from line 35 if the user selects completed tickets? Also why is it displaying if there are no completed tickets I would move it down to above line 42 so it's displayed only if there are tickets. Also you should split up the code in the Assignments_load method so that it's shorter and easier to read. Also what happens if it gets an unknown ticket status I'd do something like the following: https://gist.github.com/CalvinRodo/d7db07a2668eb4039f88 *Please note gists are blocked at my place of work so I had to write the code email it to my phone and then copy it into a gist so I apologize if it didn't work properly or I forgot to copy over code* **Tech.VB** You are storing Role as a Skillset but in your new you are taking it in as an integer, it should be passed in as an enum. Also move the enum out of the class. In your ToString you shouldn't compare the enum to integers, you should compare against the enum values, if you insist on using integers get rid of the enum. Ex: If Me.role = 0 then should be: If Me.role = Skillset.pcSupport **Help.VB** Instead of using Append followed by an AppendLine just use append line ex: sb.AppendLine("To add a new tech to your team") **Login.vb** All your fields are local to the btnLogin_Click form they should be declared in there. You are displaying an error when the user enters the wrong user name and password but then still displaying the next form. You should use a guard clause something like the following at the beginning of the btnLogin_Click method: If(string.IsNullOrWhitespace(txtPw.Text) OrElse String.IsNullOrWhitespace(txtUser.text) then lblError.Text = "Please enter both a username and password" Exit sub End If You are doing two things in the btnLogin_click form you should extract some methods to make it easier to read. It should look like this: Private Sub btnLogin_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnLogin.Click If(string.IsNullOrWhitespace(txtPw.Text) OrElse String.IsNullOrWhitespace(txtUser.text) then lblError.Text = "Please enter both a username and password" Exit sub Dim user as Tech = GetTechInformation() DisplayNextForm(user) End If End Sub **SQLBot** your aren't poperly disposing of your connection the code should look like the following: Public Function returnDataTable(sqlQuery As String) As DataTable using(connection as As New SqlConnection("server=HERMAN-W8\sqlexpress;database=support;Trusted_Connection=Yes")) connection.Open() Dim dataAdapter As SqlDataAdapter Dim datatable As New DataTable dataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter(sqlQuery, connection) dataAdapter.Fill(datatable) Return datatable End using End Function The way it is written know you are leaving a sqlconnection open all the time and just opening new ones eventually you will run out of connections. **SupervisorControlPanel.Vb** Use guard clauses it will make the code easier to read for instance in the method btnEditTech_Click if you invert the if statements the beginning of the method would look like this also you should extract a method for the second if statement it's too complex and a pain to read): If lstTechs.SelectedIndex &lt;= -1 Then 'if the form is filled out properlly lblError.Text = "Please select a tech to edit" Exit Sub End If If DataIsFormattedIncorrectly() Then lblError.Text = "Please ensure all data is entered and formatted correctly" End If With the extracted method looking like this: Private Function DataIsFormattedIncorrectly() as Boolean return txtFName.Text.Length &gt; 0 And txtLName.Text.Length &gt; 0 And txtTechEmail.Text.Length &gt; 0 And txtTechEmail.Text.Contains("@") And cboTechRole.SelectedIndex &gt; 0 End Function This is much easier to read and you don't have to scroll to the bottom to see what happens if you fail these tests Also the opening and closing of connections should happen in the sqlBot code not here ticketTable and tickets are never used in this file they should be removed. **Ticket.vb** You are casting dateReported to a DateTime and then displaying a ToShortDateString if it's not assigned but just outputting the object if it is assigned be consistent here. You are replacing spaces with %20, why not just URLEncode the strings? Currently you are missing all the other things that need to be URLEncoded. Call this method on the strings https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httputility.urlencode%28v=vs.110%29.aspx TechControlPanel.vb and Help Desk.vb (also don't use spaces in file names) doesn't exist in the project so I couldn't look at it. 
Thank you so much for this feedback. Lots of great stuff I am going to try and apply to my project later today!
That I definitely know how to do. I had to write a PowerPoint Viewer application for the HR TVs at work that automatically update themselves by looking in a folder for a newer file. 
Good point. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible since the OP seems to be a beginner. His question might also be homework, so I'm leaving all the extraneous considerations as "an exercise for the reader." But you're right, don't do it exactly like that in production code. 
whats the error you are getting? 
Also to answer your final question, this is a 6 credit course at a Community College called Visual Basic for .NET Environments. It serves as an introduction and is supposed to cover to the intermediate though there is no second course in any languages offered in my program. 
Quit linking all the stuff I am going to link before I even know I should link it... Does that make any sense at all :) 
Sorry, I assumed you were agreeing with the statement in the comment you were replying to that the app.config is compiled into your application, therefore anything in there is hard-coded.
I like what Jak said, lets go with his answer :) 
I read your statement about C and I am in the same boat. I worry sometimes that my legacy understanding of code limits me when it comes to what they are teaching today as far as MVC patterns etc. I also worry I am turning into the old guys who shouts at the kids to get off his lawn... 
No problem, it's all about making sure that your code is readable (ex: not creating an enum and not using it but using integers), removing any redundancies (ex: not creating an object then over writing it without using the one you created), making sure that the code is exactly where it should be (ex: not creating Field Variables that are only used in one method), and that you are doing things correctly. 
Ok, but in all fairness, you had 5 hours :) Plus it really needs to be in the community &amp; resources ~~list~~ er, Region.
One last comment create an assignment class something like Class Assignment Source as String Tech as Integer Agent as String StartDate as DateTime EndDate as DateTime End Class Then instead of shoving that data in an ArrayList and assigning it to the Assignments.Tag object and working with strings you can cast that Tag object to the Assignment Object you just created and it will make your code much much cleaner. Same thing for the StartEndDate form create an object to pass around instead of an ArrayList In fact never use ArrayLists they suck always use a generic collection if you need a list of something this prevents you from having to cast from object to the thing you want and prevents you from accidentally putting something you don't want in the list. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3326599/whats-wrong-with-an-arraylist In this case if you don't want to create an object I recommend a List(Of DateTime) to put in the tag.
The program will run until I enter the menu option. After I enter the text I want to encrypt. It gives me the error indexOutOfRangeException was unhanded. Thank for looking. 
First and foremost, if you're going to allow user input then at the very least, ensure that you are comparing against the same case. This can be achieved by fixing the line userText = data.ToUpper.ToCharArray() Strings comparisons are case sensitive by default so "h" &lt;&gt; "H" and since you only have capital letters in your arrays, you need to ensure that the input from the user is the same case. The second issue would be to use TryParse to ensure that in the menu part if the user doesn't type a number the program won't crash. Now, you're probably getting an index out of bounds and honestly, I haven't taken the time to debug your code to see why without some studying of it all. Here's a tip that should greatly reduce your code and make it a lot easier to follow and implement. Your CharArrays are actually strings in the sense that a string is an array of Chars(). Therefore using the indexOf method would produce the index you require for finding the alternate character in the encriptionKey array. Example: For Each c as Char in userText ' cause that's all we care about for the looping 'Return me the index of where the current char 'resides in the string Dim ndx As Integer = CStr(mappingKey).IndexOf(C) 'Since you don't have any checking for invalid characters 'I'll just go with: Ok, found the index, now pass the index 'to the encriptionKey array to get it's corresponding letter. System.Console.Write(encriptionKey(ndx)) Next So with this code and your arrays, by entering: HELLO WORLD, I would receive back: FIBBY QYVBJ Then you can just use this same method while switch the arrays to decrypt. 
At the VERY LEAST if you could set remarks in code blocks green that would be a big plus to visually seeing the difference in code and comments inside code. Dim SomeCode For TheUser 'Make this green or at least another color. I also agree that the thumbnails are kind of a waste of space. The other stuff, I would probably have to see some comparison.
Now all we have to do is work around the limitations of the Reddit Platform :/
If I am understanding you correctly. You have a textbox that contains number and text. You wish to go through the text in the textbox and find all numbers and multiply it by another value. I think it would be better if you looked at the logic a bit differently. Instead of doing your multiplier after the fact do it when they press the button adding the text to the textbox with the correct values. Can you post the original problem for us? I dont want to be sending you down the wrong path. 
Yea, after sending that it dawned on me that reddit probably has limitations as I looked around at various programming subs and didn't see anything that looked any differently than what we're dealing with.
The .doc has built in margins and word wrapping. It would work even if you copied and pasted text into it from a normal textbox. The PrintDocument however requires a lot more work in this area. I personally prefer using the .rdlc reportviewer as you can visually design your page and drag and drop the layout from your datasource. EDIT: since I didn't really answer your question, I'll offer [this as help](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996492.aspx). I've not tried it but it appears to be a WYSIWYG setup for the printdocument.
The header doesn't appear to be much larger than the standard size.
Worse comes to worse, could I not have the application on the pc/server publish the html file in a public folder? That way, the receiver app can pull right from there?
Thanks a Bunch!, Will start watching these tonight!
Add a class to your project and declare the variable in the class Class.vb Public MyVariable as long 
A public variable, declared at form level, can be accessed by other forms. Public Class Form1 Public someValue as Integer End Class In order for you to access the variable from another form, you can use: Form1.someValue
You could put the results in an array or a list and use their index position: Sub Main Dim results = {"(zero)", "Blank", "Hit", "Hit", "Double Hit", "Advantage", "Advantage", "Advantage/Hit", "Double Advantage", "Double Advantage", "Double Advantage"} '... For i = 1 To 7 debug.print(results(i)) Next End Sub Just make sure to cover the entire range (arrays or lists start at zero, so you'll need to put something at that position) because there is no "case else" equivalent. If your die rolls go from 2-12 (for example) you need to make sure the array has 13 elements (0 to 12). Or you could substract 2 from the die roll to shift the index from your die result to a zero based range.
Make a Function that contains the select statement, accepts a dice variable as a parameter, and returns the result. Then you can just call it for each die as you roll them. 
I wouldn't use a hidden control to hold the values. What you need as an array or a list to hold the variable number of values. Personally, I'd store all of the data in variables, and then rebuild txtOutput as needed from the values that have changed. 
I was thinking about this morning after having gone through your code and I don't think you should use the Tag property of forms to pass data. It's much better to pass it in the constructor, it's more explicit what you are doing and it enforces that the right data is passed in. With a tag anyone can send through anything so you have to check to make sure that the data you get out is the right type. For instance you have a form that reads a number out of the tag adds four and prints it, you have to check to make sure that the data type passed in was the correct one: Public Class PrintIntForm Public Sub Foo Handles Button.Click If(Not (typeof Me.Tag is Integer)) Then throw new Exception("Expecting Integer in Tag Property") End If label.Text = (CInt(Me.Tag) + 4).ToString() End Sub End Class However if you pass it in through the constructor then you don't need to do that check and it's caught at compile time. Also the person consuming the form can tell what it needs just by looking at it instead of having to read the code to see if the Tag property is in use. Also exposing a public property is a valid course of action as well Public Class PrintIntForm Private _numToPrint as Integer Public Sub New(numToPrint as Integer) _numToPrint = numToPrint End Sub Public Sub Foo Handles Button.Click 'No Need to check for type, no need to convert from object to integer. Much much better. label.Text = (_numToPrint + 4).ToString() End Sub End Class
Are they typing in the calculation or are they pressing buttons like a calculator? These are two very different solutions. One has you doing tokenization of the string and the other has you just reading in a number then performing a calculation against another value. Also do you care about order of operations, so for instance does 1 + 1 x 3 = 6 like if you were to type into a calculator 1 + 1 and then multiply the value by 3, or does 1 + 1 x 3 = 4 as you would get if you were to follow bedmas where Multiplication is calculated before addition? 
The form has a "Shown" event that occurs after the form is first shown. That's probably the one you want.
Not sure I understand correctly all you posted, but: 1. Threading can use Subs. 2. Your function could be define to return "as object" and you could return "nothing" (but using a Sub would be better). 3. Do you have to use threads directly, or would BackgroundWorker or ThreadPool be easier...? I'm not familiar with Awesomium nor entirely sure what you're trying to achieve by threading, but as an example of how I use threading in an app I maintain: Public Sub PrimeReportEngine(State As Object) ... a bunch of code that produces an empty report + export to PDF, just to prime all the various components of the report engine. End Sub At the beginning of the main form load, I do: ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(AddressOf PrimeReportEngine) All that runs in the background while the user is entering his username/password on the login form. 
You should check out a server wrapper called McMyAdmin. It does pretty much everything you described and is free for small servers (no sense in reinventing the wheel). https://www.mcmyadmin.com/
I just added this to another comment and I figure I'll paste it here as well It's some examples of passing data to forms (remember forms are just objects) https://dotnetfiddle.net/Cmv5Wf
OK, no problem, but you seem to be confused with array dimensions and that is what is causing your outofbounds conditions. You have an Array (27 characters long) called mappingKey You have an Array (27 characters long) called encriptionKey You have an array (unknown characters long) from the user's input called userText. Using nested for loops you need to create the first loop to run from 0 to the length of userText -1 In the inner loop, you need to loop through the length of mappingKey until you find the letter of the current iteration of the 1st loop. Once found, you need to take that value and pass it into the encriptionKey as the index for its associated letter. You then need to stop looping on the inner loop and return control to the outer loop so that it can start again on the next character of the userText. I'm not sure why you're defining those variable at the top of your code and giving them those values but they are not needed for what you're doing. Loop through userText Loop through mappingKey array if the mappingKey(2nd Loop Iterator variable) = userText(1st Loop Iterator variable) append the encriptionKey(1st Loop Iterator variable) to a string exit for Next Next EDIT: I should also mention that since a string is a array of char, there is no need to covert the user input to an array. Just iterate through the string (so define userText as string instead of Char()) For example if you were to run the following code Dim myName = "CharlieMay" MessageBox.Show(myName(3).ToString) the result would be "r" as it is located at index 3 in the array of chars that makes up the string.

Wow... Thanks for making my brain explode and wrecking any hope of ever working for Google. I was finally able to accomplish this, but it took me a couple days of toying with it and I'm certain there are much more efficient ways of doing it, since what I ended up with is really odd. :-P [The output yay!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jkfk6r5z84f5hb/output.png?dl=0) The effective code is essentially 1 Sub and 1 function: The IsMatch() Function - I break the constructor string and the target word down to character lists for easy handling. Then I produce a target "WordValue" that is a sum of the contained bytes in the target Word. I then loop the supplied "random" characters and systematically subtract the bytes from the total. If the total is reduced to zero, then all letters have been matched and the function returns true. Weird, I know - but it worked! :-P Private Function IsMatch(Values As String, Word As String) As Boolean Dim CharList As List(Of Char) = Values.ToLower.ToList Dim WordList As List(Of Char) = Word.ToLower.ToList Dim WordVal As Integer WordList.ToList.ForEach(Sub(c) WordVal += Convert.ToByte(c)) For Each c As Char In CharList If WordList.Contains(c) Then WordVal -= Convert.ToByte(c) WordList.Remove(c) End If Next If WordVal &gt; 0 Then Return False Return True End Function The ScanAll() Sub - This just clears my output box and runs lambdas for the IsMatch and sorting (to get the longest matches first, as part of the criteria), and limit the search results according to a specified value. Private Sub ScanAll() txtOutput.Clear() Dim lstOut As New List(Of String) Words.ToList.ForEach(Sub(k) If IsMatch(txtScan.Text, k.Value) Then lstOut.Add(k.Value)) lstOut.Sort(Function(a As String, b As String) a.Length.CompareTo(b.Length)) lstOut.Reverse() Dim count As Integer For Each line As String In lstOut count += 1 txtOutput.AppendText(line &amp; vbNewLine) If IsNumeric(txtLimit.Text) AndAlso count &gt;= txtLimit.Text Then Exit Sub Next End Sub There is one other small sub that just loads my dictionary from a text file into a Dictionary collection that I run the scans against. I omitted it here since it wasn't really part of the objective. I'd share an output pic but I'm a reddit n00b and don't know how in comments. [Edit: I think I got it]
It wasn't but thank you for the help nonetheless. It is a login window of sorts which will send the data to the main form when it is done (no sensitive data) Rather than opening yet another thread I will ask you here. Please just ignore if you don't want to - I completely understand. I guess you noticed it was me that opened the thread about the diablo calculator? I am re-creating it, but hopefully writing it better with less 'fluff'. I ran into a similar situation as my first attempt but I don't know if there is an easy fix... If you remember my other thread (if you read it) I loop 13 items from Blizzards API server and pull data for each item (doesn't take long). I figured I would add a progress bar to display to the user why there is a pause. Each time it loops I do a step in the progress bar - the problem is the program freezes and comes back showing all 13 steps completed. It's minor at best because it isn't a long time (1-3 seconds) but I figured information is better than no information and it would make it look complete. Any experience with 'locking up' during loops? Logically it should do the step, as it has passed the loop, but it doesn't show anything. No problem if you don't want to reply :) Have a nice day!
Dang, I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder.
Both versions will require the appropriate VB Runtime. VB6 exes should work, as the VB6 runtime is bundled into Windows 7 and Windows 8. For VB5 you may be able to get it to run if you install the Runtime files. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/vbruntime You'll also need to install / register any additional libraries that the program needs. 
Thanks!
Good luck making sense of decompiled VB. As /u/hdsrob said, you're likely just missing MSVBVM50
Mega - I will honestly try and leave you alone now haha. Thank you yet again.
Very, very nice. I'm adding that to my list of quick tools and utilities. How do you parse the request when you get a POST or a GET with many arguments? I'm guessing you can extract that from the context? I generally use a bare-bone WCF class library, so that I can define my ServiceContract and my WebInvokes and get all the parsing done by WCF.
I support many VB6 applications and they all run on Windows 7 64bits. Here are a few tips I learned along the way: * You have to put related .DLLs and OCXs in the \Windows\SysWOW64 folder. Remember to run regsvr32 to register OCXs and ActiveX DLLs. * If the app uses ODBC and you need to configure connections, there are TWO odbcad32.exe programs: one in \System32 which is for 64 bits applications, and the other in \SysWOW64 which is for 32 bits applications. Yes, it looks reversed, but it is what it is. &lt;Cue "thank you note" music&gt; Thank you, Microsoft, for giving them the same name, and confusing the hell out many developers deploying for the first time on Win64. * Older versions of Crystal Reports can be a pain to get to work. [See this page for help.](http://support.cyriouswiki.com/Crystal+Reports+Driver+Installation) An important thing to keep in mind is that on Windows 64bits, the folder \System32 contains the .DLLs for 64bits applications; while the folder \SysWOW64 (WOW stands for "Windows on Windows") contains the *32bits* DLLs and others... Windows64 is supposed to do the right thing when you run a setup program, but it doesn't always work. The console command "for %i in (*.ocx) do regsvr32 /s %i" can be useful. :) Last thing: If you have even older VB programs, in 16 bits, those won't run on Windows 64. 
It's pretty good on speed. Those computer thingies are fast, man. From my tests, the IsMatch can plow through the entire dictionary in about 2 tenths of a second.
Tackling a TableLayoutPanel question? You, my friend, are a courageous man.
That seems to work, though I did notice something else I'll need to fix. Logic-wise, not layout-wise. Rolling the custom control sounds like a good idea too, though I think the last time I did that was in VB5 or 6.
All good man, I am working on a permissions manager right now, for I hate handwriting out permissions for Minecraft. 
If you put your UI thread to sleep, you won't be able to process any events. If you want to detect key presses from anywhere on a form, you can set the form's KeyPreview property to True and you'll get them all in the form's FormX_KeyPress event. If you don't want the keypress to continue on to the underlying controls, you can set e.Handled to true in the keypress event and the key won't be sent to any further controls.
Go line by line and research it yourself. MSDN is a great place for getting documentation on the code. MSDN.microsoft.com 
That's why your course wants you to explain your code. To stop cut and paste without learning. 
Fine! it's in the resource list ;)
Other post?
it could be any of the 4 imported, if there is no data pulled on the report it doesn't create a tab for it. 
Did you make sure the DGV control wasn't extended beyond the tab boundaries? If it is, bring it fully into view and try the anchor property to lock it in to the tab boundaries. [screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cfotjidvc15itj2/oob2.png?dl=0)
Yep. I even added another row as a spacer below the DGV in the table layout. And expanded the tab to larger than the containing control.
I am a little bit confused about your question. You need to describe whta your code is doing but you, yourself do not know what it is doing? I think the excercise you are going though is there to help you with this exact question. While it is beneficial to find code around the internet or other programs you have written, you should be able to conceptulaize what each of those elements are doing, by describing what each element is doing you can give yourself a better understanding of what your code does. When you understand your code to this level it becomes easier to find inconsistancies, bugs or less efficient code. 
Hate to ask the painfully obvious, but do you have the ScrollBars property set to "Both", "Vertical", or "Horizontal"? DataGridView1.ScrollBars = ScrollBars.Both
Had to double check, but yes. I made the DGV scrollbar property a property of the parent control and pass it in that way. It's programmatically set to ScrollBars.Both, and originally it was that way in the designer properties.
Whew! That's a big project. Can't open it in my version of VS, but I found the StellarSystemInfo and opened the .vb as text. What I see is: Public Property GridScrollBars As ScrollBars End then in the Form Load event: dgvOrbits.ScrollBars = GridScrollBars To me it doesn't look like it's ever being instantiated (New) or assigned any value, so perhaps its inheritance is returning Nothing (Null).
You can trap the error condition and keep going. That would look like: Do While Len(strFile) &gt; 0 strPathFile = strPath &amp; strFile On Error Resume Next DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, _ acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9, strTables(intWorksheets), _ strPathFile, blnHasFieldNames, _ strWorksheets(intWorksheets) &amp; "$" On Error Goto 0 strFile = Dir() Loop The risk with this is that it will skip on any error condition and not just because the sheet is missing (e.g. will also skip if file is corrupt, etc.) You can write a more elaborate error checking code if you're concerned about that. You could also make the "loop through files" the main part, then do the following: ' open the workbook up for read-only Set xlWB = Application.Workbooks.Open(strFile, Readonly:=True) for intWorksheets = 1 to xlWB.Worksheets.count set xlWS = xlWB.Worksheets(i) select case xlws.name case "Ces", "Error", "processed", "skipped": blnImportSheet = True else blnImportSheet = True end select if blnImportSheet = True THEN DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, _ .... The above is rough code and not actually composed in Excel (so buggy, but gives you the idea). If your codebase is in Access, you'll have to create an Excel Application object to open the file directly like that. It would be interesting to see if you can do the import against the worksheet object since you already have the workbook open.
Do the tabs get names when they are created? 
Used this and got it to work perfect! Thanks so much!
Can you start a git repo on this man (github.com) This working with dropbox is killing me :) 
Read the documentation for the Read method: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader.read(v=vs.110).aspx You're 6th one is the end tag. Though I think it should be going through more than 6 times. You have whitespace nodes too I am assuming? Either way, don't you want to declare a XMLDocument and use the Load method passing in the XMLReader? Then you could get the root node and navigate the child nodes without all this readto stuff. The only reason to not do this is if you XML documents are huge. Then you might want to read them directly.
I thought when I called xmlStreamIn.ReadToFollowing("AdScreen") That it only read entry nodes. Your explanation makes sense for the exit node. I was able to prove this by checking the nodetype. I understand how to use an XMLdocument to retrieve the information. I was exploring other options. XmlDocument is pretty heavy for just reading in a settings file. Was looking to see if I could find a better way. Thanks for the help. **B** 
Ah, I shall try this and inform you tomorrow. It's late now, thank you very much 
That is it, I was trying to think out solve it in a way more roundabout way, trying to never get the dbnull 
Actually, what I sent will still break. Try this: If Not IsDbNull(row(2)) Then If CInt(row(2)) &lt;&gt; 0 Then k = k + CDbl(row(1)) * CInt(row(2)) End If End If
(Also realized I changed up my json, could've been both) { "register": { "UserName": "Xblade724", "UsergroupName": "Members", } } So anyone reading this: is {} the same thing as [] for a json object .. ? Above worked, even though I used register:{} instead of register:[] EDIT: Also realized I had trailing comma at end. Why was this accepted?
Go to love that old school documentation :P 
Oh I suppose I can :) Give me a bit and I'll post the repo. https://github.com/Eluken/AI_Aide
Do you need to do a settings file from scratch? Can you use the built in config files? Or xml serialization? Or one of the many many config libraries for .net https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=config 
If you add a "Sub New" to the form, you'll see that a "InitializeComponent" line is inserted by VB. That's where your controls are initialized. You can declare your "flds as object" in the header, but you should set it after the InitializeComponent. Like this: Dim flds() As Control Sub New() ' This call is required by the designer. InitializeComponent() ' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call. flds = {Button1, TextBox1} End Sub 
Hi, I tried doing as you said, but the flds = {Control1, Control2, ...} is being problematic; the '{' character is underlined blue, and an error is thrown, saying 'Expression expected'. How to proceed from this?
As far as I know, VB2008 cannot do it in a single line. Collection initializers where added in a later version.
Oops! Just saw you're using OleDB, but that *should* contain the same UpdateCommand features. Just change the namespaces used in the video. Here is the same class used in the video, but adapted for MS Access or OleDB: [AccessDB class - .txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nbzdpk5xkwnr48/AccessDB.txt?dl=0) 
I can confirm this. It's 32 bit only.
Whether you save it to text or "binary" is pretty much arbitrary and up to you. Either way, the process is basically the same: Go through the array and write each object to the file in a format you can read back later. The .Net way is by implementing ISerializable and then using one of many serializers available (you can find tons of examples and guides with google) to read and write your files. XML and JSON are popular formats nowadays, but you can also find binary serializers (although the basic .Net one is not very good). If your object is fairly simple, you can create your own format and read and write it yourself. I'd suggest adding a few things like "version" so that if you improve your map in the future, you are still able to read older versions; maybe checksums to prevent errors or tampering; and if you wish to compress and/or encrypt it, it's always simple to plan in advance than to retrofit it later. 
You should look into "databinding" [MSDN example here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973824.aspx). Many other tutorials and guides can be found by googling for "dataset databinding datagridview". Basically, you don't need to go through the rows and cells yourself to update all your data. The databinding framework of WinForms can do it all for you. 
Couldn't agree more. There's no reason to do any of this by hand (and lots of reasons not to). 
I guess text would be fine. It's all strings and integers anyway. I'll just go that way.
Oh thanks! My bad. I'm still new to linking classes/objects to my form, it's not easy coming from writing code in a simple console lol. Also sorry about the dutch language, I translated some parts of it, but it seems i've forgotten some other parts..
I do think there's some ambiguity with pseudocode, so depending on your need this might be okay. That being said, pseudocode is designed to give a high-level view of the algorithm, and as such any programmer should be able to read it and know how to implement it, which isn't possible here. I suggest replacing lines like 'Declare Variables' with the variable names needed, and 'calculate' with how you would calculate etc. 
I'll try that TNGHT!
First off let me say thank you so much for this. It is truly amazing that you went into such depth for this. Just amazing! Going off of what you said creates another question. Keep in mind that I am horrible at programming. Really quick too how would I simplify this? Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load If bar1.Visible = False Or bar1.Value &gt; 0 Then npc1.Visible = False End If If bar2.Visible = False Or bar2.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc2.Visible = False End If If bar3.Visible = False Or bar3.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc3.Visible = False End If If bar4.Visible = False Or bar4.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc4.Visible = False End If If bar5.Visible = False Or bar5.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc5.Visible = False End If If bar6.Visible = False Or bar6.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc6.Visible = False End If If bar7.Visible = False Or bar7.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc7.Visible = False End If If bar8.Visible = False Or bar8.Value &gt;= 0 Then npc8.Visible = False End If End Sub 
This time the program runs but nothing shows up in the List Box: [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/iZQum)
Sorry about this late reply, but i'm back! (I'm preparing for my exams later this month and cant really afford to waste too much time lol.) So far I understand this code to load in the countries &amp; capitals: https://dotnetfiddle.net/2wRm2w Also, I made a screenshot of what i'm supposed to get in the end: http://s2.postimg.org/4ydrtj6jt/Screenshot_1.png So I decided to make a Sub or a Function for each red thing, not sure if this is the correct choice? I'm also supposed to use an enum to make a choice between the questions "What is the capital of this country?" &amp; "What country is this the capital of?". "Problem" is, our teacher gave us the private variables to work with, so we HAVE to use the ones we got. So besides the variables to load the countries &amp; capitals in (which I understand). We got: https://dotnetfiddle.net/Ueo1Vl So I know I have to use the correctAnswer variable in some sort of If structure comparing the country &amp; capital value (1,1) or (2,2) and if they match, it means the answer is correct right? And then I can +1 on the score. I have no idea on how to compare the (1,1) or so though, neither do I have any idea on how to use the enum so pick random questions (nevermind even matching the correct dropdownlist answers for the correct questions, lol.) I found out how to load certain stuff in the dropdown list, but I can't use it for the Quiz, I mean, it just fills the dropdown list with strings, but you can't actually use it to compare the (1,1) or (2,2) with. (Just to clarify, i'm not asking you to spoonfeed or anything, im trying to figure out how to do this, but it's not easy for a beginner, lol.)
I know this is not directly VB but I am asked this all the time so I thought it would be appropriate for here. **B**
Solid answer man. **B**
Bonus Cookies for Jak... :) **B** 
Here is the final solution Public Sub SaveScreens(path As String) ' serialize to XML and save Dim xmlSettings As New XmlWriterSettings xmlSettings.Indent = True 'xmlSettings.OmitXmlDeclaration = True Using xmlStreamOut As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(path, xmlSettings) xmlStreamOut.WriteStartDocument() xmlStreamOut.WriteStartElement("Screens") For Each item In ScreenItems xmlStreamOut.WriteStartElement("AdScreen") xmlStreamOut.WriteElementString("ScreenName", item.ScreenName) xmlStreamOut.WriteElementString("ScreenComment", item.ScreenComment) xmlStreamOut.WriteEndElement() Next xmlStreamOut.WriteEndElement() xmlStreamOut.WriteEndDocument() End Using End Sub Public Sub LoadScreens(path As String) '&lt;AdScreen&gt; ' &lt;ScreenName&gt;Test Screen 1&lt;/ScreenName&gt; ' &lt;ScreenComment&gt;Test Screen 1 Comment&lt;/ScreenComment&gt; '&lt;/AdScreen&gt; ScreenItems.Clear() Dim xmlDoc As New XmlDocument xmlDoc.Load(path) Dim nodes As XmlNodeList = xmlDoc.DocumentElement.SelectNodes("AdScreen") For Each node As XmlNode In nodes Dim name As String = node.SelectSingleNode("ScreenName").InnerText Dim comment As String = node.SelectSingleNode("ScreenComment").InnerText ScreenItems.Add(New Classes.AdScreen(name, comment)) Next ScreenItems.RaiseListChangedEvents = True AddHandler ScreenItems.ListChanged, AddressOf ScreensChanged 'ScreenItems.Sort(Function(p1, p2) p1.ScreenName.CompareTo(p2.ScreenName)) End Sub
Seems like a fairly straightforward problem. Algorithmically, you'll want to: - Get the customer's sizes - Set the prices depending on the sizes - Multiply prices by the quantity of each robe - If total robes &gt;= 5, give a 20% discount to postage - Total postage - Apply discount to postage, if applicable - If local community group, apply 50% discount 
[It WORKS!!!](http://imgur.com/1yGJ7en) I did have to change the file to be in .wma though... but IT WORKS!!! Thank you for your help. Now i have to make it look pretty. 
 Text1.Text = Replace(Tex1.Text, "123", "abc")
Where does that go? Does that replace the existing text1.text line? &gt; Text1.Text = Replace(Tex1.Text, "123", "abc") 
Additionally, if you want to run code (such as counting the replacements) at each replacement, then you can replace the replace() function using instr() like you were doing. Dim lStart as Long, sFind as String, sReplace as String Dim lCount as Long lStart = 1 sFind = "123" sReplace = "1-2-3" lCount = 0 Do until Instr(lStart, Text1.Text, sFind, vbTextCompare) &lt;= 0 lStart = Instr(lStart, Text1.Text, sFind, vbTextCompare) Text1.Text = Replace(Text1.Text, sFind, sReplace, lStart, 1, vbTextCompare) lStart = lStart + len(sReplace) lCount = lCount + 1 Loop msgbox lCount &amp; " replacements made!"
OK I think I figured out my problem, it's my implementation of choosePivot(). I'll edit this post once I fix it. EDIT: ok it's definitely choosePivot. I've since replaced with a random index between lo and hi and it works! However, I'll still appreciate if anyone has any ideas on how I can take the median value of first, middle and last elements to calculate the index (aka Sedgewick's recommendation).
My mistake, I misread. I don't know how to make a control transparent when it housed inside Awesomium web content window. Their own documentation even says the same thing. It is possible you might be able to subclass the control using something like this; [How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wk5b13s4.aspx) As far as your first comment sorry I misread again, but quit your trolling it's not how to get help here.
Sure but lets do this in its own thread. http://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/37dhwc/upoody24_asks_a_homework_question/
Now that deserves an upvote! :) 
I couldn't get any of these solutions to work. Hope you guys can come up with something else. http://i.imgur.com/hqyILSS.jpg
I tried this, and it won't work. Here is the full code: The calculator is to get from Euros to Dollars or from Dollars to Euros. Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim num1, num2, num3, num4 As Single num1 = (TextBox1.Text * 0.91016656) num2 = Math.Round(num1, 2) num3 = (TextBox1.Text * 1.0987) num4 = Math.Round(num3, 2) If RadioButton1.Checked = False And RadioButton2.Checked = False Then MsgBox("Selecteer of u Euros om wilt rekenen naar Dollars, of Dollars naar Euros. Aub.") End If If TextBox1.Text = "" Then MessageBox.Show("Please fill in a number") End If If RadioButton1.Checked Then Label4.Text = num4 End If If RadioButton2.Checked Then Label4.Text = num2 End If End Sub 
I LOL'ed and not a fake one either. :) 
That's unable to go to Double?? and it selects : num1 = (TextBox1.Tekst * 0.98190001) and says "Invalid Cast Exception was unhandled"
I could.
thank you I'd be happy to do this when I get home in a couple hours. Thanks again!
Didn't want to use my real account at school, made throw away. 
Here is the entire project. It's just one form. Once it's loaded just choose the first group from the combo1 box called 0SEC. The text box should say 'Torrent' and when you click the replace button it should make it change to 'Torrent2'. However if you type 'Torrent Torrent Torrent' into the text box on the bottom, and then click the replace button, it will only replace the first instance of the word 'Torrent'. It will not change the second and third instances of 'Torrent'. Thanks in advanced. http://speedy.sh/zMM5q/nfo-editor.zip
Is it just me, or is that a VB 5.0 form and not a VB 6.0 form? Cause VB5 didn't have the Replace function. (Notice I say past-tense... because really, no one should be using VB5 for anything... same can mostly be said for VB6). Here's a clone of the Replace function that you put in your project: http://www.devx.com/vb2themax/Tip/18933 Overall though, your code seems more than a bit jumbled and defective. You also seem to keep saying "It doesn't change more than just one", but that's completely obvious from the code that it should only change one thing. To wit, I'm pretty sure that means that you don't understand what any one line of your code is supposed to do, and instead mostly mashed together other modules. You should take the time to review each line of code that you have to understand what each line does. Your subroutines aren't matching the names of your command buttons. Command3_Click won't ever fire if you don't have a Command3 button. My suggestion is that you delete all of the code that you don't understand what it's doing. Put in the Replace function from the link I just gave. Then, whenever you want to replace text, use that function. Also, familiarize yourself with [string functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd789093.aspx), [do... loop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eked04a7.aspx), as well as [Select...Case](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cy37t14y.aspx). Also consider downloading a newer version of VB. They are free now mostly.
Yes, a fool's errand; they are not the same language. Badging .NET as visual basic was a misnomer on Microsoft's part. That's not to say if you know both languages you can't transcode (rewrite) it manually.
&gt;I ended up starting a new project and just using the old code as a reference. This is the best answer. You'll not only have an easier time just rewriting most of the code, but you'll also get a chance to update functionality along the way. As stated in a different comment, a lot of things you likely have in the old code can be done better in .Net and you'll be better off rewriting the code and using the old code for reference.
For the hidden information, you can use something like "Fiddler" to look at what is transmitted between the browser and the remote site. It could be loading data using javascript and never putting it into the page source. Instead of clicking the button, you should be able to send the URL directly (when you click a submit button, a new URL is called with the form parameters either in the URL or in the body if the type of call is a POST; you can also see this using Fiddler.) 
Loop through all the elements on the page until you match enough attributes. You might be able to speed things up by using some GetElementBy___ methods in the HTMLDocument Class. As far as grabbing the data from the page between the button press and the data being sent, as long as it isn't in a password field you might be able to use the HTMLDocument's "click" event in some way.
Back in the day when we wanted to grab data from the web with VB6 we used the [WinHttpRequest COM object](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384106.aspx) it was a C++ object but it was the only thing we could use at the time. My guess is the post back is returning that data from the login either to the Request or Response headers. This is a common way to pass data back that is not included in the body of the page. Using the WinHttpRequest object was pretty straight forward. You add a reference to the `Microsoft WinHttpRequest Component, version 5.0` then use something like this to request the page. You will need to mimic the login command and call the specific page the post event is linked to so that you can get the data back. Cant help you with specifics on this becuase you did not tell us anything about the webpage. Dim WinHttpReq As WinHttp.WinHttpRequest Private Sub Form_Load() ' Create an instance of the WinHTTPRequest ActiveX object. Set WinHttpReq = New WinHttpRequest End Sub Private Sub Command1_Click() ' Create an array to hold the response data. Dim d() As Byte ' Assemble an HTTP Request. WinHttpReq.Open "GET", _ "http://www.microsoft.com/library/homepage/images/ms-banner.gif",_ False ' Send the HTTP Request. WinHttpReq.Send ' Put status and content type into status text box. Text1.Text = WinHttpReq.Status &amp; " - " &amp; WinHttpReq.StatusText ' Put response data into a file. Open "temp.gif" For Binary As #1 d() = WinHttpReq.ResponseBody Put #1, 1, d() Close ' Load the data file as a picture. Picture1.Picture = LoadPicture("temp.gif") End Sub Once you have this down you can examine the different data reported back and find which object is storing the data you are looking for. ###documentation https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384086.aspx Neil Obremski had probably the best webdocs for it. http://www.neilstuff.com/winhttp.html **Are you stuck on vb6, for this is super simple in .NET?**
Wouldn't it be simpler to just disable "Fast User Switching" on the PC? http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/disable-fast-user-switching-in-windows/ If you still prefer to list them, you can adapt the C# code from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/132620/how-do-you-retrieve-a-list-of-logged-in-connected-users-in-net to VB to enumerate the currently logged in users. I believe you also need administrator access to do so.
A simpler way to do it from VB might be to use a tool like [PsLoggedOn](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897545). Shell it from VB, pipe the output to a text file, then read and parse the text file to display your listbox. Something like: Dim StdOut = "", StdErr = "" RunProcess("psloggedon.exe", "-accepteula", StdOut, StdErr) Where RunProcess is: Public Sub RunProcess(Exe As String, Args As String, ByRef StdOut As String, ByRef StdErr As String, Optional TimeOut As Integer = 60000) ' Set start information. Dim start_info As New ProcessStartInfo(Exe, Args) start_info.UseShellExecute = False start_info.CreateNoWindow = True start_info.RedirectStandardOutput = True start_info.RedirectStandardError = True ' Make the process and set its start information. Using proc As New Process() proc.StartInfo = start_info proc.Start() ' Attach to stdout and stderr. Using std_out As StreamReader = proc.StandardOutput() StdOut = std_out.ReadToEnd() End Using Using std_err As StreamReader = proc.StandardError() StdErr = std_err.ReadToEnd End Using proc.WaitForExit(TimeOut) End Using End Sub You then should have your list in StdOut. Parse the lines and fill your listbox. 
Problem: We often include emoticons in our text messages to indicate how we are feeling. The three consecutive characters :-) indicate a happy face and the three consecutive characters :-( indicate a sad face. Write a program to determine the overall mood of a message. Input Specification There will be on input text box that can contain between 1 and 255 characters. Output Specification The output is determined by the following rules:  If the input line does not contain any happy or sad emoticons, output none.  Otherwise, if the input line contains an equal number of happy and sad emoticons, output unsure.  Otherwise, if the input line contains more happy than sad emoticons, output happy.  Otherwise, if the input line contains more sad than happy emoticons, output sad. Sample Input 1 How are you :-) doing :-( today :-)? Output for Sample Input 1 Happy Sample Input 2 :) Output for Sample Input 2 None Sample Input 3 This :-( is str:-(:-(ange te:-)xt. Output for sample Input 3 sad I would just like to know the coding to count the number of times a specific text appears. This is from a high school culminating task and this problem was originally from a competition.
ok, lets move this out to its own thread. http://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/34ucda/homework_questions_rvisualbasic_and_you/ 
String.Split interprets the argument as a char array, so it will still give a count for ":-)" if the text containt any one of ": - )" You probably meant to use VB's split (I know I get them mixed up all the time): count = Split(sourceLine, ":-)").Length - 1 Sub Main ' test in LINQPad dim s = "This is a test - with only one smiley: :-)" dim w = s.split(":-)").length // Option Strict off w.dump ' prints 3 dim z = split(s, ":-)").length-1 z.dump ' prints 1 End Sub Oh, and you need "-1" after the length to get the correct count. Other than that, everything's peachy. :-) **EDIT:** Ha. I got it wrong too. s.split *does not* interpret it's argument as a char array, it appears to do CChar(":-)") which is basically only splitting on ":". I thought it did something like ":-)".ToCharArray, but I was mistaken. Ah well; Option Strict forces you to specify exactly which one you want, which, in this case, is a very good thing.
the trick with the InStr and IndexOf method is that you have to keep track of the position in the line, remove the part of the line up to and including the instance of the sub string. Then start the loop again with just the remainder of the string. Repeat this while counting until you run out of string. :) 
Can you give me an example? I'm quite confused on how the code would look like. Or should I stick with the split method, although I'm a bit of confused on that one also.
Let me start by saying thanks for including the original problem booklet and your code. It is rare we get to see the problem as a whole, and we appreciate it. The first thing that I see when I start tracing your program is that you are not using any structure to collect all of the variables into a whole. Your module creates the following variables Public DeliveryPrice, ProductPrice, FinalPrice, Price, DiscountPrice As Integer, NetworkPrice, RCPrice, SolarPrice As String after that your frmwelcome_load function has a do loop that loads each of the products into the variables. I believe this is creating the product list. The problem with this is that there are many orders so you will need to have a list of items for sale (products), and then a list of orders(order information plus a list of items ordered) I would start this app by defining the data that needs to be stored. Lets start with your products. Here is what you know about your products. * There are 3 products * Each product has a name, price, and description There are two main ways to create organize chunks of related variables. The first is using a [structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4ft0z102.aspx) the second is using a [class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/ms973814.aspx). Let's create a structure that stores a single products information. in form_welcome place the following code. Public Structure Products Dim name As String Dim price As Double Dim description As String End Structure This structure describes everything about a single product. Now the magic, when you want to load in your products from your file (we can talk about how to store it in the file later) you would create a storage space with n number of elements to it. Dim Products() as Product To load this with your product information you could use Dim products(3) As Product Dim x As Integer = 0 For x = 1 To 3 products(x).name = "" products(x).price = "" products(x).description = "" Next keep in mind this is not the actual code that you would use just somthing close. You would do this during you file load from your text file. I would also store all 3 products in the same text file and load them into the structure as you come across them in the file. This is a start for you to learn what you need to know. I will be blunt, from the code that you have supplied to us you are lost and I would suggest that you go back and examine variables, structures and classes. Understanding variable scope and collections will also be of use to you. This assignment is very hard for the 3rd assignment in a high school programming class. What books and materials did they give you for learning programming? I see application design here not learning "programming". WHere you expected to understand a programming language before starting this course? 
First off, thank you for all of that, I **greatly** appreciate the assistance, and I'll get to work immediately reading, writing, and learning all of the things you suggested. I will agree with you, I am **completely** lost, and my classmates... well they are even further lost. We have a serious issue with the fact that our teacher has very little experience teaching this subject, and was not the intended teacher for the subject, as the last time she taught this subject was like 9 years ago, when things were quite different. Our classes are pretty much made up of her either bringing in work for us to do, that she doesn't even have the knowledge to complete and is incapable of answering the questions we have, or her telling us to complete exercises from our book. (The book is "Programming with Visual Basic - Introduction to Visual Basic .Net (Third Edition) By Graeme Summers) We were not given anything other than this book to learn the language, nor did we get a choice in what language we learnt, nor were with expected to understand a programming language before beginning the course. Also, do you agree that the 250 minutes we have been given for both design and development phase isn't enough? We feel like it's impossible to get that much done in that space of time
"Replace" is a function, it returns the new string, so you need to reassign it to FullDocument. FullDocument = Replace(FullDocument, DocWrit1AndFriends, Docwrit1New) That should do what you need. Note that in .Net (and Java and many other high level languages) strings are immutable, they cannot be changed directly. Because of that fact, most string manipulation functions will return a new string. It's also why if you're going to do a lot of concatenation you should use a StringBuilder. But I digress.
I know how you feel man, I never seem to feel like I am on "top" of programming like I used to. There is always something I am finding out after the fact. I just resigned myself to every time I do a new project I am going to change the way I do my next project. 
It sucks when your teacher can't help you as much as you would like and I am sure that she feels the same way. It is what it is. The book that was given you is not bad. As a jump start I would use these videos; http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners You and your classmates watch the first 10 videos then and get back to me. I can help you get this program completed once you are aware of the fundamentals. These videos are recommended almost all of the programmers I trust here on /r/visualbasic. I agree with you 250 minutes is a bit short considering the level of knowledge that is being presented. It is not impossible though, you have to choose if you want to put the effort in and learn programming. The channel9 videos will give you a huge jump start. I am also willing to help you and any of your friends in the class. Hell if you come here there are great people Charlie, Postal, Rob, and a bunch of others who will bend over backwards once they know you are truly interested in learning programming. 
Thanks man, it works.
For better post-load/initialization events and exception monitoring, use the Form_Shown event. Fails: Public Class Form1 Private imgBG As Image = Image.FromFile("Guy1.png") Private G As Graphics Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load G = Me.CreateGraphics G.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100)) G.DrawImage(imgBG, New Point(0, 0)) End Sub End Class Works: Public Class Form1 Private imgBG As Image = Image.FromFile("Guy1.png") Private G As Graphics Private Sub Form1_Shown(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown G = Me.CreateGraphics G.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100)) G.DrawImage(imgBG, New Point(0, 0)) End Sub End Class [Output - ScreenShot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wawvnwt83y18ztg/dude.png?dl=0) The bulk of your coding will go into the various classes/objects that you're using - each method and event being a member of its respective class. Personally, I feel that this is quite clean and logical, since your application is/should just be a collection of intercommunicating objects.
Your example doesn't quite work as intended, because these events each only fire once, and things like GDI+ custom drawing need to be handled when painting occurs. To illustrate, if you took your code that uses the shown event, it will certainly draw on the form. If you minimize and restore the window though, the drawing is gone, because the form repainted. For custom drawing on a WinForm, it should be done in the form's paint event, which will fire when the form is in need of redrawing. This will allow the graphics to persist when the form is minimized/restored, moved outside the desktop bounds and moved back, etc...
Ahh, yes. For automated redraws, I would generally use the Paint event, Timer + Draw() Sub, or a Threaded loop, perhaps with some frame control. I figured, by his wording, that he was more concerned about the initial project loading and assumed that he was already familiar with the ins and outs of his drawing routine. :-) 
Are you doing it within a .vb file? I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't get compiler feedback unless you were typing in a .txt file or something like that. Otherwise I would close/reopen VS if you haven't do so already, as it could just be a glitch.
It's within .vb file it's really wierd, I closed the VS, restarted PC, paryed to GabeN. Nothing's working, guess I'll redownload 7GB of Visual Community 2013, and reinstall it. Gonna take 14 hours tho. I'm thankful that you wanted to help, let's hope that reinstall'll fix it. If that won't fix it I'll just rewrite it in C#
What do you all think of this? Public Class Form1 Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load main() End Sub Private Sub main() REM Main code goes here End Sub End Class I'm just curious if there's a generally accepted way of coding when using a Windows Forms Application.
Responding to myself: it doesn't work, because the call to main() happens before Form1.Load reaches its End Sub, so a draw command in the main() sub won't be executed. This is kind of frustrating.
I donwloaded the Visual Community 2013 then repaired the install, now Dim works as intended. It's really strange.
It's working now, after repairing the Visual Community 2013.
Thank you for taking the time to go through this and listing the two problems. After correcting the code, it produces an output of "2,3,4,5,1". I assume it's because of the *Do loop* because if I change the **Do... Loop until** into **For x = 0 to 999** then it produces the correct output "5,4,3,2,1". Any ideas whats wrong with the logic of the original loop? 
Worked perfectly thank you.
Thanks for the reply. I've tried this approach but the text in the textbox runs underneath the button. It's obscured as the user types.
No project, just was learning how to bubble sort an array using a method mentioned in a book I read for an upcoming my Comp Sci. exam. But now that I've probably flunked it, I don't think it matters. Thankyou nonetheless. 
Don't have any answers (haven't worked in VBA in a million years), but wanted to suggest the VBA sub, as it's more focused on VBA, as opposed to VB in general: http://www.reddit.com/r/vba/
Thanks!
try this. me.dirty=false This forces a form to make sure that its current record is "clean", that is, free from unsaved edits. You can also use it as a test, like this: if me.dirty then me.dirty = false end if 
Then you just didn't have the dockings setup correctly. There should be no overlap. Again if you provide what VS/framework version you are working with, I could illustrate with a sample.
You aren't actually reading the file into the file() variable. Dim file() As Byte Try Filename = OpenDialog() If (Not Filename Is Nothing) Then System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(Filename) '&lt;&lt; this isn't going anywhere, and should be changed like below End If Catch ex As Exception ..... End Try change the above to: file = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(Filename) '&lt;&lt; Read the file into the variable. 
Oke, i see where i went wrong, i changed it as you said, but... , when i upload a file it is still 0KB
The reason is that you are concatinating strings of numbers together instead of doing math on them. The + operator works the same as the &amp; operator when it comes to strings. So you are getting 8156 which is "8" + "15" + "6" Try lblTotal.Text = ((Val(txtSmall.Text) * 4) + (Val(txtmedium.Text) * 5) + (Val(txtLarge.Text) * 6)).ToString
This is not a question for the visual basic sub. 
Thanks, that makes sense. I think I would still prefer validation before trying to leverage user input. 
I'm not sure if this is the cleanest solution, but you can "invert" a path by adding it on top of a rectangle. E.g. create a new `GraphicsPath`, add a rectangle the size of the corner, and then add the pie. This probably only works for filled shapes and not for outlines, though.
That would work, I think. I will try it. So really what we want is to create a rectangle from the corner edge as large as the set width, filled fuscia. The draw a pie filled in the form or header color depending upon corner. I will give this a shot. I am having a hell of a time getting the arc thing to work.
I agree, but since this looked like homework I wanted to answer the specific question at hand and not create too much confusion. In real world situations, I would never use VAL() because it can produce unexpected results. In reality, I would use a modified textbox control that only accepts numeric input in the first place, so the user cannot enter an invalid value.
Sorry to bother just realized added a new post instead of replying to your thread meaning you wont get notified. Can you take a quick look at this for me. I am missing something fundamental. 
Because the `Using` directive is in the `DrawCorner` method, the path gets disposed when the method returns and thus is invalid by the time it's passed to `G.FillPath()`. Move the `Using` into `OnPaint` or remove it and dispose the path manually.
crap makes sense. Somedays I wonder what has happened to my brain... 
OK here is how I finally sorted it out. Using path = New GraphicsPath() Dim x As Integer = _RoundedCornerRadius ' Draw Left upper corner path.AddRectangle(New Rectangle(0, 0, x, x)) path.AddPie(0, 0, x * 2, x * 2, 180, 90) ' draw Right upper corner path.AddRectangle(New Rectangle((Width - x), 0, x, x)) path.AddPie(Width - x * 2, 0, x * 2, x * 2, 270, 90) ' Draw Left bottom corner path.AddRectangle(New Rectangle(0, Height - x, x, x)) path.AddPie(0, Height - x * 2, x * 2, x * 2, 90, 90) ' Draw right bottom corner path.AddRectangle(New Rectangle((Width - x), Height - x, x, x)) path.AddPie(Width - x * 2, Height - x * 2, x * 2, x * 2, 0, 90) e.Graphics.FillPath(Brushes.Fuchsia, path) End Using cut my code to about 1/4 of its origional size and allows me to assign the radius of the corner via a property.
I can't get it, for some reason. Could someone download it for me? It's in post #4, it says 111 KB next to.
I created a picturebox, but can't find where to set this property, either in the Properties tab or in PictureBox1.___ in the code. I have NET 3.5. EDIT: I found this: PictureBox1.Image.RawFormat.Gif But I presume this is just normal gif, not animated.
At design time, you select the picture box, and then in the properties grid you find the "image" property and set it to the desired gif. In code: PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile("C:\SomeAnimatedGif.gif") 
Can you point me to some commands that deal with animation specifically? Like setting the timedelay between images.
When it comes to the picturebox and displaying an animated gif, there are no settings. Each frame of an animated gif has a control block that tells it how long that image should be displayed before moving to the next one. So the time delay will be whatever was intended by the animated gif when it was created. If you need more control than that, you would have to use more complicated methods for displaying the animation.
A combination of 1 and 2 would work, that's simliar to how CSS handles margins. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/margin
I'm trying to create an animated gif, though, not view it, is it possible .NET has commands for viewing animated gifs but not for creating one?
Thanks Cal you would make my life difficult ;) p.s. comment appreciated and I agree with you. 
So what I am seeing here is *Create a query that given n number of parameters returns list of matching nodes for a given treeview* Have I got that right? Second question if this entire structure is in a dataset already why do you want to query the TreeView? Would it not be simpler to take you parameters and query the dataset directly via a select statement? then redraw the tree. Last question do you wish to search or filter? A search will return matching nodes a filter will remove non matching nodes from the TreeNodeCollection. Its much easier to duplicate the TreeNodeCollection reiterate through it, removing records that don't fit your needs then rebuild treeview from the new list. 
1. is good but I'd make the property nullable so that nothing also means not rounded. If you choose 2. then I'd really dislike the space delimiter because it's a string and not strong typing etc. I'd go with an integer array that has to have 2 or 4 items. So {2,4} would be the same as {2,4,2,4}. That's how XAML also does it.
&gt; So what I am seeing here is &gt; Create a query that given n number of parameters returns list of matching nodes for a given treeview &gt; Have I got that right? Yes. And `n` is a value between 1 and 6. &gt; Second question if this entire structure is in a dataset already why do you want to query the TreeView? The scenario is that the user has a specific Node in mind that they want to find... but they **don't** know ***where*** it is in the structure. But, because they know a specific word/set of words/identifiers/whatever that the item has, instead of clicking to open each level, scan the children nodes, possible expand/collapse another level of items, etc. trying to find it (there are several hundred total nodes in each structure)---or perhaps they want to find ***all*** items with a specific word/identifier but don't know how many or where they are all--so they can just enter the search term in the textbox and hit enter. It's more of a Find/Find Next feature: one you hit the enter key/search button, it finds the first matching node in the TreeView, sets it as the `TreeView.SelectedItem` and then calls `EnsureVisible()` on the node so that all of the levels are expanded and the node is visible to the user. If that isn't the node the user wants, they hit enter again and it does the same thing with the *next* node in the tree that matches the search. &gt;Would it not be simpler to take you parameters and query the dataset directly via a select statement? then redraw the tree. That's kind of what I am doing... I'm using LINQ to return the rows (or, more accurately, the row's table key) of the items which match the search query. Once I know what the Nodes I am looking for are, I can iterate through the collection and use the `TreeView.Nodes.Find(keyValue)` that returns the Node with that KeyValue (all nodes have unique key values). &gt; Last question do you wish to search or filter? A search will return matching nodes a filter will remove non matching nodes from the TreeNodeCollection. Yeah, I guess I should have been more clear the first time around that it's more of a "Find/Find Next" functionality than it is a *proper* search query... just that there are several different fields for each item that may contain the value(s) they are looking for. &gt;Its much easier to duplicate the TreeNodeCollection reiterate through it, removing records that don't fit your needs then rebuild treeview from the new list. Hmmm. Well, for ***this*** specific functionality, we don't want to modify/hide/filter any items in the TreeNodeCollection... we just want to bring the user to the next Node that matches. *However*... there ***are*** a couple of features/functionality that are still a bit down the road---ones that I wasn't really too sure how I was going to go about adding without completely reinitializing the whole Tree structure--and this *will* be the ***perfect*** solution for those! That is actually a ***really*** big relief to me, now, knowing that--once I get there--there is a really good way to accomplish what I need to do! Seriously: ***THANK YOU!*** As for my problem above: I didn't quite get it doing what I was aiming to do... but a couple hours after I posted this, I *did* manage to find a way that will allow me to accomplish what I need it for: Instead of having a mergedResults collection of DataRows, I went with a `mergedList as New List(Of Integer)`. When I get down the `If [...] Then` checks for which search fields are selected, I changed it to `If [...] Then mergedList.AddRange(findResults{#}.ToList())` and then, at the very end of the function, it returns `mergedList.Distinct()` and removes any duplicates. (On Monday I will probably look into a quick/easy ways for sorting list before the Find/FindNext function iterates through it, but it's not super-important at the moment). Now it will take the key values in the list and then use `TreeView.Nodes.Find(mergedList(n), True)` to cycle through the matching nodes results. So, while I managed to discover a way to accomplish what I need to do, I decided not edit the post/flair as being "Solved" because I still want to understand a good/better way to do combine the results of multiple LINQ statements (all from the same data source) and combine the results in a single object/collection that I can iterate through.
&gt; If you minimize and restore the window though, the drawing is gone, because the form repainted. fun fact: the behavior regarding this depends on the operating system/window manager. I discovered a difference regarding this between Win Vista/7 and XP. XP always throws away the paint "state" while Vista and 7 sometimes keep it.
Let's say I have the following: Dim g As Graphics g = Me.CreateGraphics g.FillRectangle(Brushes.LightGray, 0, 0, 10, 15) g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, 0, 0, 20, 35) What lines would you add so as to save each Fill line as an image in an animated gif?
there is also SystemColors.Control
the "control" color is actually the wrong color for window backgrounds in Windows though. You won't notice on XP, but on Vista and higher the background color is called "Window". It's more like white, not gray.
yes that's the case. It's possible to create a gif from multiple layers using some imaging namespace but there are no options whatsovever.
Since this is a user control I have to deal with the expanding and collapsing property grid functions. I am just bitching and complaining :) 
Have you researched financial.pmt?
&gt; Amount = System.Console.ReadLine().**ToLower()** &gt; If Amount = "Ten" Then nice one :D you either check for "Ten".ToLower() or change that string to "ten". Same with Amount &lt;&gt; "Ten" further down.
Awesome! Thank you for this!
I've gotten this far: Public Class Form1 Dim g As Graphics Dim b As New Bitmap(100, 100) Dim myEncoderParameters As New System.Drawing.Imaging.EncoderParameters Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load g = Graphics.FromImage(b) End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click g.DrawLine(Pens.DarkOliveGreen, 10, 10, 80, 80) b.Save("C:\1.gif", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Gif) g.DrawLine(Pens.Coral, 80, 10, 10, 80) b.SaveAdd(myEncoderParameters) g.DrawLine(Pens.Black, 20, 10, 40, 80) b.SaveAdd(myEncoderParameters) Stop End Sub End Class On the first SaveAdd line it gives me a "Value cannot be null. Parameter name: Structure" error.
hey /u/tthomps are you a programmer? You keep posting links to stuff in the community but you don't ever discuss anything?
Sorry, no. I meant what I said. It might not even be possible. I want a button on a form in VB to access 1 cell on 1 sheet from excel at random and then display it in a new window in VB. 
 Thanks for clearing that up. As long as the document is saved in as xlsx format you can access the excel dom via [Open XML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854.aspx) This would allow you to grab the cell you want. If it is an XLS document you can use something like this. Imports Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel Module Module1 Sub Main() ' Create new Application. Dim excel As Application = New Application ' Open Excel spreadsheet. Dim w As Workbook = excel.Workbooks.Open("C:\file.xls") ' Loop over all sheets. For i As Integer = 1 To w.Sheets.Count ' Get sheet. Dim sheet As Worksheet = w.Sheets(i) ' Get range. Dim r As Range = sheet.UsedRange ' Load all cells into 2d array. Dim array(,) As Object = r.Value(XlRangeValueDataType.xlRangeValueDefault) ' Scan the cells. If array IsNot Nothing Then Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", array.Length) ' Get bounds of the array. Dim bound0 As Integer = array.GetUpperBound(0) Dim bound1 As Integer = array.GetUpperBound(1) Console.WriteLine("Dimension 0: {0}", bound0) Console.WriteLine("Dimension 1: {0}", bound1) ' Loop over all elements. For j As Integer = 1 To bound0 For x As Integer = 1 To bound1 Dim s1 As String = array(j, x) Console.Write(s1) Console.Write(" "c) Next Console.WriteLine() Next End If Next ' Close. w.Close() End Sub End Module 
Okay, /u/kleinma... today I tried implementing the concept/idea I outlined, above. I had to make a couple of small tweaks (mostly just to how the function checked/compared the two values for matches) and... IT WORKED! :D AND it is ***SOOOOO*** much cleaner and easier to understand than what I had been trying to do, before, which also makes me much more comfortable with this solution. I just... I just don't know why it never dawned on me that *I'm* ***not*** *limited to using* ***just*** *the standard SQL query operators* in LINQ statements. It seems so obvious, now, that I think about it. \**facepalm*\* Thanks for your replying! It was ***really*** instrumental in helping me realize this! 
Let the server do the work async. Modify/create a return object that'll give the necessary info. Option 2 is to give the illusion of speed by providing the first call ' info and "paginating"(????) the rest. That's all I can think of right now...
This could change "17" to "214".
 Dim input As String = "1 cup mayo, 17 tablespoons basil, and 223 cups ranch dressi" Dim output As String = "" For x As Integer = 1 To Len(input) Dim thechar As String = Mid(input, x, 1) If IsNumeric(thechar) Then 'check next Dim y As Integer = x While 1 y += 1 If IsNumeric(Mid(input, y, 1)) Then x = x + 1 thechar += Mid(input, y, 1) Else Exit While End If End While thechar = thechar * 2 End If output += thechar Next MsgBox(input &amp; vbNewLine &amp; output)
updated the code since thebasterd pointed it out
&gt; thechar = thechar * 2 &gt; While 1 caught someone writing option strict OFF code? I replaced all your VB6 keywords with their .Net equivalents: Dim input As String = "1 cup mayo, 17 tablespoons basil, and 223 cups ranch dressi" Dim output As String = "" For x As Integer = 0 To input.Length - 1 Dim thechar As String = input(x) If Integer.TryParse(thechar, Nothing) Then 'check next Dim y As Integer = x While True y += 1 If Integer.TryParse(input(y), Nothing) Then x = x + 1 thechar &amp;= input(y) Else Exit While End If End While thechar = CStr(CInt(thechar) * 2) End If output &amp;= thechar Next MessageBox.Show(input &amp; Environment.NewLine &amp; output) Note that the code won't be able to detect numbers like 2.6
Based on the code others provided I created one that is able to do this: http://puu.sh/ifM6B/78c5614bc2.png Note that the decimal mark in the input string has to conform to your locale. So use . or , depending on your region settings or it won't work. Dim input As String = "1,5 cup mayo, 2½ tablespoons basil, and ⅘ cups ranch dressi" 'watch your region settings! Dim output As String = "" Dim previousWasNumber As Boolean = False Dim previousNumberLength As Integer = 0 For x As Integer = 0 To input.Length - 1 Dim tempNumber As String = input(x) If Char.IsNumber(input(x)) Then If Char.IsDigit(input(x)) = False Then 'special number like ½ tempNumber = CStr(Char.GetNumericValue(input(x)) * 2) If previousWasNumber Then 'combine numbers Dim previousNumber As Double = Double.Parse(output.Substring(output.Length - previousNumberLength)) Dim newNumber As Double = previousNumber + Double.Parse(tempNumber) output = output.Remove(output.Length - previousNumberLength) &amp; newNumber.ToString() Else output &amp;= tempNumber End If previousWasNumber = True previousNumberLength = tempNumber.Length Else 'check next Dim length As Integer = 0 For y As Integer = 1 To input.Length - x - 1 If Double.TryParse(input.Substring(x, y + 1), Nothing) AndAlso input(x + y) &lt;&gt; " "c Then tempNumber &amp;= input(x + y) Else length = y - 1 Exit For End If Next tempNumber = CStr(Double.Parse(tempNumber) * 2) x += length output &amp;= tempNumber previousWasNumber = True previousNumberLength = tempNumber.Length End If Else output &amp;= tempNumber previousWasNumber = False End If Next MessageBox.Show(input &amp; Environment.NewLine &amp; output)
On the button click event, set a variable as textbox.text to save the value

Yeah, you got it. 
my BIOS does it's POST beep, so I definitely do have the hardware.
I had a CIS instructor who would deduct 500 points from a program if there was a GOTO in the code.
He's done this before...been 8 weeks after I posted a solution to his VB6 Gold offer [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/30632s/another_vb6_question_reddit_gold_reward/cppiv93?context=3) - Nada! 
I'd recommend not doing visual basic to start and instead do Java. I started with visual basic and it was pretty useless. -Comp Science Major finishing his freshman year of college
I'd love to start with Java, the issue is, if I want to test out of my High School's course, I NEED to learn Visual Basic, as that's what my High School's Comp Sci 1 curriculum is based on, they won't let me move on to Comp Sci 2 or eventually AP if I don't.
That is quite terrible. I would ask your teacher if you can just teach yourself Comp Sci 1 over the summer and take a placement exam to get out of it...If not, move your schedule around.
Yeah, delegates can be confusing. Let's see if we can clarify a bit: Basically, delegates allow you to pass logic to a function just like you would pass a string or an integer. You can call a function with an integer argument, right? What if you want to call a function with "code" as the argument? That's what delegates are for. You might not see the need for that; I know it took me a while to "catch on" to the usefulness of being able to pass code to a sub or function. A common example of that is "sort" functions. VB gives you a default "sort", but you can also give it your own "comparer" if you want to sort on esoteric things or use an order that is not numeric or alphabetical. It's impossible to predict all the way people will want to sort things; so you write an efficient sort and let people pass in the "comparer" method that actually does "ranking" between two elements. Devs can now sort anything they want, and they don't have to re-implement QuickSort themselves (error prone) or, worse, code another shitty bubble sort. So, if you have a list of items: dim lst = new list(of items) lst.add(... ' we add a bunch of items, whatever they are; VB has no idea how you should sort those. You can use VB's sort by telling it how it need to compare those items: lst.sort( function(itm1, itm2) itm1.Size.CompareTo(itm2.Size) ) Everything after ".sort(" is the delegate. Here, it's in the form of an anonymous lambda (a function that doesn't have a specific name and is written directly in-line), but it's doing the same thing a delegate will do. A delegate just has a lot more "boilerplate" code associated with it. Now, if we take your assignment as an example, you have a requirement of doing many different things to a string. You need to reverse words, count characters and count words. You could write 3 different functions (and actually, we will) but you can also use a delegate that you will pass to a single function to do the actual work. You can think of the delegate as the "blueprint" of the function. When you pass "normal" arguments to a function, you tell it "argument1 as integer, argument2 as string, etc.." so a delegate does the same: it describes how the functions you will be passing will look (what they take as arguments and what they return.) For your assignment, you could do something like this: Private Delegate Function StringOperation(text As String) as String This goes on a line by itself, at the form or module level (outside other subs and functions). Now, we're going to need something that accepts that delegate as an argument and does something with it: Private Sub DoSomethingWithText(Something as StringOperation) dim input = InputBox("Enter your text: ") dim result = Something(input) MsgBox(result) end sub Ok, this is very simple but still: we have a generic function that will ask the user to enter some text, will run the delegate we has passed in on the text and then show the results to the user. You can create as many different delegates as you want and you won't have to repeat the inputBox/msgBox parts. Let's write one of those functions: Private Function ReverseWords(text as string) As String Dim words = text.split(" "c).ToList words.Reverse Dim reversed = Join(words.ToArray, " ") Return reversed End Function This function takes a string and returns a string; it matches our delegate "blueprint" that we defined. We can use it with our generic "DoSomethingWithText" sub: Sub Main Dim revWordOrder As StringOperation = AddressOf ReverseWords Call DoSomethingWithText(revWordOrder) End Sub Here, we declare "revWordOrder" as a "StringOperation". It's like "as String" or "As Integer"; think of it as "As That Delegate Blueprint" if you want. We then (on the same line) assign it to our "ReverseWords" function we wrote by using AddressOf (because the "revWordOrder" needs to know where the code it represents is located). You then call "DoSomethingWithText" and pass it the "revWordOrder" delegate. Done. You can write other functions that meets the same signature (takes a string, returns a string) and pass them to "DoSomethingWithText" and it will always work. If you put that in a library, other devs can write their own "StringOperation" functions and pass them to your "DoSomethingWithText" in the library and they never need to bother with inputBox and MsgBox. Of course, this is a contrived, toy example; but hopefully it clarifies what delegates do a little bit. 
Sorry I haven't been on in a few days, but I am glad you got things working and that you learned a little more about what you can do with LINQ.
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Precision Read up on the link above, and double the size involved. Basically, no matter what data type you're looking at, the number of values you can resident is limited by the number of ways you can arrange your bits. Integers have it really easy, with a whole number increment between each value. Float can represent the same number of values, but we chose to stretch it out so that it covers a larger area and has a variable amount of precision. Float doesn't have a number of "digits" it remembers per say, but rather a number and a scale.
Not advocating GoTo usage, but in VB6, GoTo was how you did error handling. It shouldn't be used in .NET because of newer conventions, but GoTo was a necessity for VB6.
 On Error Goto Resume Next ;)
I didn't presume anything, however if you don't actually provide any code, then all we can do is guess as to what the issues are. Clearly Nothing can be cast to an integer which will return 0, so that IS NOT where your nullreferenceexception is coming from. When you read a registry key using the .NET built in registry classes, you have to call GetValue on the specified key. If that key doesn't exist, then you are getting a null reference to the key object, not the value. When you call GetValue on a key object that is nothing, you will get a nullreferenceexception. If you were to fix that, it wouldn't happen.
 Using w As StreamWriter = File.AppendText("C:\Users\cangetenough\Dropbox\test.txt") w.Write("Testing!") End Using
Just because 95% of your class will cheat doesn't make it alright.
That makes much more sense. Thank You so Much this helps a lot. Also I have had a quick read of the link you posted and it looks like it will help too. So once again thanks so much!
Ya I know how to do that, but it will be used on computers that do not have my DB folder. To be honest, I do not even know if it is possible. 
How do you normally edit the file? Through a web browser?
I edit it via my computer DB file. But I am going to have users using my application that will not have access to direct folder. If that makes sense 
That is a good idea to look into. Thanks for the advise! 
If you want to do this from any PC independent of a local Dropbox installation, you'll have to look into their API. They list some C# libraries [on their developer site](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdks/other) that should be usable in VB as well. That probably also means requesting an API key and dealing with OAuth, though. Not sure how Dropbox handles this exactly.
This is VBA code though so it may not be what you are looking for
How would I do that with searching for the value I want? 
Visual Studios - Sorry
I have zero code done at this point. I have messed with some, but I always have so much trouble with implimenting excel. 
There is quite a bit to it. This looks like a good starting point for you though: http://vb.net-informations.com/excel-2007/vb.net_excel_2007_open_file.htm If you find this to be too much maybe check out VBA in excel. It is very easy to work with.
I got it all working just how I want it. Thanks for you input, huge help! 
Got another question if you have a minute - If the result is NOT found, any way you know how to give a error? I used the below code.
http://www.vb-helper.com/howto_csv_to_array.html
A case statement would be more effective in this instance
I was thinking about using the VID and PID but I believe that the same product would have the same VID/PID, wouldnt it?
Just make sure you close your database connections first.
I'm not familiar with TableLayoutPanel at all, but you're probably right that it's better! :) Still, I'll personally stick with custom classes because that's what I'm comfortable with.
What OS are you on?
i dont understand most of it :s there is no other way?
I never personally used or was taught how to use the tablelayoutpanell, but I'll give it a try! Thank you.
Value holds the number of the box, eg 2, 4, 8, 16. It's used for other logic, like determining whether the boxes should merge. A 2d array is like a table that holds stuff: in this case, instances of the box object. Therefore, if I have a 2d array named grid, grid(2,4) will point to the 3rd element from the left and the 5th element from the top: because arrays count from 0 instead of 1. Although you will technically not need the x and y properties within the box object - because you can extrapolate that from the array position - it makes life a lot easier when coding if you first stored where the object is supposed to be and then attempted to move it to said array position. Storing the x and y also allows you to use a dictionary instead of an array if you prefer, which is nice. 
The [lostfocus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.lostfocus.aspx) event fires when multiple actions occur. See the[lostfocus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.lostfocus.aspx) link for the specifics. The jist of it is that when a control looses focus the event fires. You do code that is needed when this event fires. Can you give us a bit of your code so we can give you more information?
thanks man! how can i put a url on a button to click and go?
Right now you're just directly taking and dumping the contents of a file onto the screen, which makes it impossible to sort. Instead, think about how you can get the contents of the file and temporarily store it into a list or array. Once you've done that, you can use the [.sort function](http://www.dotnetperls.com/sort-vbnet) built into arrays and list to sort it alphabetically.
put control on page awesomium.Source = new Uri( "http://www.awesomium.com") 
Thank you for replying! this is what i have so far Public Class Form1 'Displays the number of clicks for each button' Dim numTimes As Integer = 0 Dim numTimes2 As Integer = 0 'Button A counts Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click numTimes += 1 TextBox1.Text = numTimes End Sub 'Button B counts Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click numTimes2 += 1 TextBox2.Text = numTimes2 End Sub 'QUIT Method Private Sub Button3_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button3.Click Me.Close() End Sub 'Lost focus on Button 1 Private Sub Button1_LostFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.LostFocus TextBox2.Text = numTimes2 End Sub 'Lost focus on Button 2 Private Sub Button2_LostFocus(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.LostFocus TextBox1.Text = numTimes End Sub End Class Basically, i have one button and the number of times it is clicked shows up in one textbox, and then there;s another button and the number of times the second button is clicked shows up in another textbox. finally there's a quit button that ends the program 
i don't know why the format isn't showing up the same way...
What have you tried, and what exactly are you struggling with? All you really have to do is handle the `CheckBox.CheckedChanged` events, and set `CheckBox.Checked` back to true if no other checkbox is checked. If you want to save some repeated code, remember that you can handle multiple different events in a single event handler method, and that you can enumerate the checkboxes via the `GroupBox.Controls` property.
I tried some codesnippets from the internet like this: Moduled class named clsCheckBoxHandler Public WithEvents chk As MSForms.CheckBox Private Sub chk_Click() MsgBox chk.Caption &amp; " Clicked!" End Sub and in the Userform Dim chkCollection As Collection Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() Dim cCont As Control Dim chkH As clsCheckBoxHandler Set chkCollection = New Collection For Each cCont In Me.Controls If TypeName(cCont) = "CheckBox" Then Set chkH = New clsCheckBoxHandler Set chkH.chk = cCont chkCollection.Add chkH End If Next cCont End Sub changed it for my intentions, but didn't work maybe i'm just a bit derp right now... i don't know
Are you using a GUI for this? (don't blame me, i never used CInt) if so, try using a TextBox. Then for the Enter-Button do this: If TextBox1.Text = "" Then MsgBox("Please enter a number between 1 and 100", 0, "Error") ElseIf TextBox1.Text &gt;= 100 Then MsgBox("Your number is too high. Please enter a number between 1 and 100", 0, "Error") ElseIf TextBox1.Text &lt;= 0 Then MsgBox("Your number is too low. Please enter a number between 1 and 100", 0, "Error") End If 'Your Code for generated number = number typed into the TextBox and the cancel-button, is this a form opened by another form? (if GUI?) If so, just do Application.Exit() to exit the Application (obvious, duh). i hope i could help. EDIT: With GUI i mean a Windows Form-Project, my mistake.
I am using visual basic 2012. Setting up the form is graphical but the actual actions is all code. As for the input box I am using it to propmt for another entry from the user and to prevent the loop from running indefinitely. Basicall the app opens, user enters a number then clicks a button. A random number is generated and compared to the users guess then it gives a message box saying it was too high or too low, then opens an input window for any further guess. I got it all working but when I tried to hit cancel on the input box or hit enter with nothing entered it gives me an error. If I can figure out how to stop the error from occurring when I hit cancel on the input box I am sure I can apply it to the empty field issue. I am going to take a look at your code now, thanks.
Okay, Sorry if i've mistaken something. you could try Application.Exit() in the Cancel-Event. i didn't want being rude, i just wanted to make my sentence more funny. Sorry for that
Not offended at all and I will take any possible help I can get. Thanks.
good point. would something like this work better? Integer.TryParse(InputBox("Enter a number from 1 to 100", "Guess a number"), intGuess)
 Private Sub LoadImage(PB As PictureBox, Path As String) Dim i As Image = Image.FromFile(Path) PB.Image = i PB.Bounds = New Rectangle(PB.Location.X, PB.Location.Y, i.Width, i.Height) End Sub That should make the PictureBox grow/shrink to the png size. Using a button [cmdLoad] an OpenFileDialog [ofdImage] and PictureBox [pbPlayer] I tested with: Private Sub cmdLoad_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles cmdLoad.Click If ofdImage.ShowDialog = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK Then LoadImage(pbPlayer, ofdImage.FileName) End If End Sub
I guess? really just depends on how detailed you want your error message to be. 
you need 4 spaces in front of each line. 
If the only thing you need to do is make the textbox count increment on button click, I don't know any reason you would use lostfocus. What exactly did the question say for this?
maybe they need to detect clicks on button B by reacting to lost focus of button A. That would be super weird and require alternating button presses though :D
Simpler code for loading and sizing the picturebox: Private Sub LoadImage(PB As PictureBox, Path As String) PB.ImageLocation = Path PB.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.AutoSize End Sub
You have to decide between WinForms and WPF/XAML. In WPF these custom designs are simpler to do than in WinForms. But XAML is quite complex if you've never worked with it. It's completely doable to create a form like in the example only using WinForms and transparency key.
That's what variables are for. Dim Input as integer = CInt(InputBox("Enter a number from 1 to 100", "Guess a number") Then you refer back to the "Input" variable later on. 
I changed it to: Private Function calculateAverage(ByRef dblMidterm As Double, ByRef dblFinal As Double) As Double Dim dblAverage As Double = 0 dblAverage = dblMidterm + dblFinal / 2 Return dblAverage End Function Private Sub displayAverage(ByRef dblAverage As Double) Console.Write("The average score is: " &amp; dblAverage) End Sub Still doesn't work. I'm not really sure what you mean by &gt;simply call calculateAverage() without using its return value I add calculateAverage(dblMidterm, dblFinal, dblAverage) and get an error saying too many arguments.
Functions return a value. You have to put that value somewhere. Right now you're calling the function but you're not assigning the result to anything. Without giving you too much help on a homework assignment, you're missing the "something = something" part of your code. I have a feeling you might be confused because you've declared "dblAverage" in two different places in your code. Keep in mind that even though you used the same name, they're actually two totally separate variables. Variables you declare within a function only exist in that function.
Since you can't do input validation or restriction on an inputbox, a more type safe way would be to return the string and make sure it will pass an integer conversion. Also add in restraints between 1 and 100 for good measure 'HOLDS INTEGER NUMBER WE ASK USER FOR Dim Input As Integer = 0 'LOOP UNTIL WE GET A VALID VALUE Do Until Input &lt;&gt; 0 'ASK THE USER FOR A NUMBER Dim inputString = InputBox("Enter a number from 1 to 100", "Guess a number") 'IF VALUE IS EMPTY STRING, USER ENTERED NOTHING OR CLICKED CANCEL If inputString = String.Empty Then Return 'TRY TO PARSE THE STRING INTO AN INTEGER, ALSO MAKE SURE THE INTEGER IS BETWEEN 1 AND 100 'IF ALL THESE PASS, WE CAN EXIT THE LOOP If Integer.TryParse(inputString, Input) AndAlso (Input &gt; 1 And Input &lt; 101) Then Exit Do 'SET INPUT TO 0 WILL CONTINUE THE LOOP GOING IN THE EVENT THE USER 'ENTERED AN INTEGER, BUT NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 100 Input = 0 Loop 'SHOW THE USERS SELECTED NUMBER MessageBox.Show("You selected " &amp; Input.ToString)
It would seem that the apionly site is expecting certain headers to be sent with the request. For example, if I were to spoof the webclient to pass in the useragent header that chrome passes to sites, the API has no problem returning a result. Using WC As New System.Net.WebClient WC.Proxy = Nothing WC.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/43.0.2357.130 Safari/537.3") Dim myString = WC.DownloadString("http://apionly.com/skype.php?username=usernamehere") End Using
I'm sorry, but my skype is private and I really like to keep it that way. I can still try to help you on here. If you take the exact code I posted, but change the hard coded "usernamehere" to your skype name (actual skype name, not specifically skype email address), do you continue to get the 520 error?
You should do your own homework. I can at least point you to the [documentation for the class you should use](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb) to do this. There are some code examples there in VB. 
Thank you. I didn't really do it the way it was supposed to be done but the exit sub command helped tremendously.
I believe that Awesomium is actually aimed more at building HTML UI, instead of specifically displaying web pages. If you are just trying to parse a page, you're far better off using the Html Agility Pack IMO. http://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlAgilityPack
 Catch ex as Exception MsgBox(ex.Message) End Try And you'll know what the actual exception is, and be better able to figure out what what is causing it.
Whoa, no, don't do this. Change 'Calculate Average calculateAverage(dblMidterm, dblFinal) To 'Calculate Average dblAverage = calculateAverage(dblMidterm, dblFinal) 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19392083/center-form-on-screen-or-on-parent 
Yup. The chart (assuming WinForms here) has a "FormatNumber" event you can intercept and use to format your numbers as you see fit. Private Sub chart_FormatNumber(sender As Object, e As FormatNumberEventArgs) Handles chart.FormatNumber If e.ElementType = ChartElementType.AxisLabels AndAlso e.ValueType = ChartValueType.Double Then e.LocalizedValue = e.Value.ToString("#.###") End If End Sub 
Just a quick read of SQLBulkCopy would lead me to move in the direction of getting your array information into a datatable(matching the columns to the table) and then attempting the bulk copy. I've not tried this, it's just a direction I would start in. The only problem is that to move the array into the datatable would probably just be another iteration process that could instead be used to insert directly into the database. So I guess I would ask, instead of building an array of your data, could you instead build a datatable of your data and then use that for your bulkcopy datasource?
I have found another possible solution : .ChartAreas(0).AxisX.LabelStyle.Format = "G4" 
I'm going for foolproof, not idiotproof. I'm probably the only one that's going to be using the class anyhow.
Yes. I am using OLEDB for other forms such as insert data into database using vb.net but I just don't know how to retrieve data from access to have it as a list in vb.net. I was trying to bound the data into listbox as well but I just get one column instead of two, despite using multicolumn as true. It shows me ItemName but it doesn't show me the price but leaves the column blank. I guess i am too newbie to explain what i want, I will google more to find what I need.
create a list use an OLEDB datareader to read the table loop through reading each row with the reader and adding the items to your list use your list for something cool
Our friends over at [connectionstrings.com](http://www.connectionstrings.com/access/) have you covered. I like to use `dataset` and `datatable` whenever I am working with data from a DB. Here is the code I use for querying a database when using sql server; Dim strSql As String = "SELECT * from {table_name}" Dim dtb As New DataTable Using cnn As New SqlConnection(connectionString) cnn.Open() Using dad As New SqlDataAdapter(strSql, cnn) dad.Fill(dtb) End Using cnn.Close() End Using Here is some boilerplate for using access. Dim adoConn As ADODB.Connection = New ADODB.Connection() Dim adoRS As ADODB.Recordset = New ADODB.Recordset() adoConn.Open("Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\myFolder\myAccessFile.accdb;Persist Security Info=False;") adoRS.Open("SELECT * FROM {Table_name)", adoConn, ADODB.CursorTypeEnum.adOpenForwardOnly, ADODB.LockTypeEnum.adLockReadOnly, 1) custDA.Fill(custTable, adoRS) adoRS.Close() adoConn.Close() Then you can do thinks like bind your [datatable directly to a datagrid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fbk67b6z.aspx), or fill a dropdown with a select statement Dim s As List(Of String) = dt.AsEnumerable().[Select](Function(x) x(0).ToString()).ToList() Learning this will let you do many cool things. Have fun with it. 
Change the AutoScaleMode property of the form to DPI instead of Font. Does that change anything?
Nailed it. Thanks a bunch.
I'm on my phone at the moment. I had a similar problem. The file in my case was on another machine and accessible via the network. My app needed to read the entire file to plot graphical data. Updates occurred every few minutes with a few extra hundred points. You can set up a fileWatcher iirc to fire an event the file is changed. At this event you can grab the file byte size and compare it with the previous observed size. If it's bigger enough to warrant an update, open file and grab the bytes that are new and append to your local copy of the data (either in memory or local cache file). Then update display. 
You need to use the FileSystemWatcher class to capture the event that your log file changes. Then you compare the old file size value with the new size. Then, you open the file with a binary stream reader, move to the point where the new data starts (the old size value comes in handy here) and basically copy everything from there to the end of the file. Close and render the data you've obtained. 
How can I be sure that I'm not running VB6? Some VB.NET commands didn't work for me. Is it because I don't have the libraries? The commands that related to Excel, like **.Workbook**. 
THANK YOU. THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH. I'll let you know the results. 
Add a shortcut to the startup,folder, no vb coding required. Also, when a computer resumes from sleep any running programs before it slept automatically are already running where they left off. TLDR nothing to do here, move along
Brilliant, that's a fantastic fix. So when the final draft comes in tomorrow, I'll export to pdf and then just add pages after the single sided portion and print all double sided? Edit: So I tried this first thing when I got to work this morning and we haven't paid for the full version of Adobe so I can't add a page in or edit the document once I've created the PDF (all I can do is export to PDF).

Don't have a good answer (haven't used VBA in a decade), but you might try over at: https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/ As for VS licenses, There are a couple of free versions of VS available (Express and Community) that give you full access to .NET (of course this doesn't help if you can't actually install VS). 
Yup. Government machine is locked down. I use VS at home. Can't get it at work is my problem :P But thanks I'll try that sub too. I'm thinking I might want to try some SharePoint forum because of the nature of the code.. Much less oriented toward a VB issue and more has to do with SharePoint actions. :\
Good call on the SharePoint aspect as well. You might try a search through stackoverflow for the appropriate VBA or SP keywords as well. 
Ctrl+Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space might be your answer. If not check under tools -&gt; options -&gt; environment -&gt; keyboard 
Try setting co.Authority = "ntlmdomain:{DOMAINNAME}" alternative, if using kerberos auth, co.Authority = "kerberos:{PRINCIPLENAME}"
Yes it is doable. What type of control are you displaying the list in now?
I believe an acBoundObjectFrame but I'm not at work anymore so I can't check
That's a very handy If statement! I'll incorporate it into my program, thanks :)
Move your variable declaration out of the sub and then use mod to determine where you are for the possible outputs. Private Sub Button3_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button3.Click 'Dim ClickCount As Double ClickCount += 1 If ClickCount Mod 3 = 1 Then TextBox1.Text = "a" ElseIf ClickCount Mod 3 = 2 Then TextBox1.Text = "b" Else TextBox1.Text = "c" End If End Sub If you want to cycle through more options like, A,B,C,a,b,c then change the 3 in this line: If ClickCount Mod 3 = 1 Then to the number of possible outputs and then add more Elseif statements for these outputs.
Thank you for responding! Edited: So I figured out what you meant and now my program shows all three alphabets, however, it shows up as "abc" when i click three times rather than showing me just c. Is there a way to get it to show only one letter 
Just checked, currently they're two subtables on a form
Sure, just try to write your other check as a boolean function, that way the intention of what your script is trying to do is much more clear at a glance, which will make it easier to change down the line.
&gt; TextBox1.Text = (TextBox1.Text + "a") It's because of this line right here, after every click you're appending a letter to the textbox. One solution would be to store the letter in another class-level variable (like ClickCount), and only add it to the textbox once a confirmation button is clicked. That leads to a ton of excess clicks though. You could also possibly work out something using a timer. Also, it's recommended to use &amp; for concatenating strings, rather than +. Personally I've never seen any problems using +, but &amp; is explicitly for string concatenation. Also, you can use the &amp;= operator (or += if you insist) to concatenate text instead of foo.Text = foo.Text + "bar" Textbox1.Text &amp;= "a"
I heard it wasn't an issue, but we should probably still check the hdmi connections to make sure the database is secure from viruses.
I facepalmed soooo hard.
Microsoft actually played this at a developer conference to a room full of VB developers. It was something when they were talking about VBs natural ease of use for beginners while giving full language capabilities through .NET. I think it was around the time of .NET 1.0 coming out. 
I have tried everything I could to try to get it to work but I still cannot figure out what I need to do in order to get the program to display one letter according to the number of clicks. 
&gt;if i click twice i want to see "b" not "ab" Perhaps here, you could store the string in the text box in one variable, then the current letter being pushed in a seperate variable. Each button click, you could change the second variable, and set the text box to contain variable1 + variable2. Of course, you would need a way to set variable1 to be the whole string when the user changes buttons.
Alright, here's something that would work. It's an ugly solution, because it requires a confirmation button and that's not how phone keypads work, but it's the quickest and easiest thing that comes to mind. I'd recommend tossing a label on the form to display the current letter. Private ClickCount As Integer Private CurrentLetter As String Private Sub Button3_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button3.Click ClickCount += 1 Select Case ClickCount Mod 3 Case 1 CurrentLetter = "a" Case 2 CurrentLetter = "b" Case 0 CurrentLetter = "c" End Select lblCurrentLetter.Text = CurrentLetter End Sub Private Sub btnConfirm_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnConfirm.Click TextBox1.Text &amp;= CurrentLetter CurrentLetter = "" lblCurrentLetter.Text = CurrentLetter End Sub Notice I also changed your If statement to a Select statement -- this is entirely optional. It just looks cleaner in my opinion, and only needs to perform the Mod calculation once rather than twice.
Thanks a lot i will try it out!
The first place I would look at is the Office Dev center. They have a lot of code for outlook that would be useful. Starting with this [How to create a calendar appointment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff861308.aspx) Also enumerating information from folders (calendars are a folder type) [Enumerating, Searching, and Filtering Items in a Folder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/ff869362.aspx) I would also look at [Automating Outlook](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/jj973160.aspx) It is very possible to do what you are asking, the trick is tapping the right event. You are looking for the [ItemAdd Event](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa155701.aspx#odc_ch11olevents_topic6). Hooking this event makes it easy to examine the item for it passes the newly added item to in the event. You can then examine that item make some choices based upon the information and then create new items in other calendars based upon your functions. Hope this helps **B**
Thank you! I'll take a look tomorrow morning and see what I can understand. 
If I understand correctly, you want to check the content of a textbox for words (or any string of characters) that shouldn't be present? If so, you can do it like this: If TextBox1.Text.Contains("badword") Then... (inform user, censor word, etc...) If you have many words to check, you can use a list: Dim lstBad = New List(Of String) {"ass","shit","ect."} For Each word in lstBad If TextBox1.Contains(word) Then ... (do whatever you want) End If Next Now that's a bit simplistic; it will catch "ass" in words like "mass" or "Carcassonne". It might also get confused by capitalization (depending on your "Option Compare Text" setting. A better approach might be: ' extract all the words from the textbox into a string array Dim strArr = TextBox1.Text.Split({" "c, "."c, ","c, ";"c, "?"c, ":"c, "("c, ")"c, """"c, "="c, CChar(vbCr), CChar(vbLf)}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) ' switch them to uppercase and put the into a hashset to have only one copy of each word Dim hsUpper = New HashSet(Of String)(strArr.ToList.Select(Function(x) x.ToUpperInvariant)) Dim lstBad = {"ASS", "SHIT", "PISS"}.ToList Dim wordCountBefore = hsUpper.count ' check how many word we had originally Dim lstCensored = hsUpper.Except(lstBad) ' remove any instance of bad words Dim wordCountAfter = lstCensored.count ' check how many words remain If wordCountBefore &lt;&gt; wordCountAfter Then Debug.Print("The text contains bad words") Else Debug.Print("All good") End If That should be a bit more robust.

thanks for the quick answer edit: I tried your tip but I can´t get it working :( May you send me an example code so I can see my mistake 
I have always wondered about this.
you can also do a direct cast dim textBoxVal as string = form2.textbox1.text What /u/PostalElf is talkigng about is placing a public variable in the form and assigning it a value when the textbox changes on teh foreign form. then you could access it via `form2.myVar` I prefer direct cast myself. Less work. this also works when you instantiate a copy of a form class. Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click Dim newFrm As New Form2 newFrm.TextBox1.Text = "Your Name Here" newFrm.Show() MsgBox(newFrm.TextBox1.Text) End Sub
You can do this two ways one loop through your array list and create an sql insert set from your values and run it as a command object, or you can do a database insert command from your data access object for each item. Both take the same amount of work and it is debatable as to which is faster over all. 
ohhh thank you very much I got it now :D
Why did you choose VBA? Why not go LAMP?
honestly, I started out with just wanting to make a spreadsheet. And then I just kind of went from there, so now I have a pretty descent application working in excel with userforms. The problem is that we cannot use the file at the same time and if we screw up then it just messes up a lot. And Id like to make something a little more user friendly. So now I've done some coding in VBA, and figured VB was the way to go :p
I have already made a working program in EXCEL, and we are supposed to use it from now, until a month or so from now. Although, I forsee my solution being a more permanent one. That is why I want to have a more robust program. So, I figured while I have developed my first EXCEL application, I can start developing the VB one while I service the EXCEL one. Dont get me wrong, the program is pretty simple so Im hoping it wont take that long.
So basically create a userform application in VB and connect it to an Access database?
&gt; You can't actually modify a collection while enumerating it with `For Each` anyway, One way you can (somewhat) get around this, I've found, is by adding a `.ToList` or `.ToArray` at the end of the collection you are iterating through. So the following code returns the correct/desired results and does not raise any exceptions: For Each item In retList.ToArray retList(retList.IndexOf(item)) = Path.GetFileName(item) Next You **will** get an exception if you remove the `.ToArray`, though. Granted, this probably is not the *best* or most concise solution in this scenario, but it **is** a solution and, in other situations, can be useful. 
Sure, but this is exceedingly inefficient. You're copying the collection, and then searching through the entire collection for each item. If you really need to access a list by index, just use a normal `For` loop.
I want to create a download manager for videos using rtmpdump. You're right, I found this snippet online and it works for one single download. So for every download I have to call a new instance of rtmpdump.exe, but I can't figure out how to monitor them dynamically. I want to use it for the homepage of my roomates university. There are Vods of the courses, and when he is home with his parents, he only has shitty internet that wont stream properly, so he wants to download them when he is here.
I will test it but am pretty sure it wont support rtmp.
The addon does not recognize the videos of the website. None of the tested addons does. 
It's the internal site for students of said university. You need an account to access it. One tool that worked is MediaBox from hensence.com, but its really messy and fucks windows up. The other tool that worked was orbitdownloader. The problem with that is, that I constantly have to pause and resume the download, because it would just randomly go to 0 kb/s downloadrate.
It's actually stored as a 64 bit signed integer multiplied by 10000, for 4 decimal digits. Apparently it's some old OLE thing. Just read it as a `Long` (or whatever labview's equivalent may be) and divide it by 10000 again. 
The Decimal type is made up of three 32-bit integers with a fourth 32-bit integer that signs it and stores the exponent. You can read more about it [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.decimal.getbits(v=vs.110\).aspx) and [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xtba3z33.aspx)
Neither Decimals nor Doubles natively use that format in .NET, but it's what FilePut uses (presumably for legacy compatibility reasons). See also Decimal.To/FromOACurrency();
So far, I've tried removing the DLL projects from the group and adding the existing .cls files to the main project. I have also removed references to the DLLs. I have named all of the classes properly (their class names and file names often differ). There were two places where the class names were called first by referring to the DLL's name and I've removed those. Is this correct so far? What more should I do to wire this up properly?
what makes you think it has errors?
permissions is usualy because something running has the file locked. if you're all running it from a shared network drive, this is the cause, and the solution is to either make everyone close it when you compile, or you switch to an actual installer-like system so everyone runs it local. I have also seen XP have some timing issue where it'll try to overwrite while XP is probing for file info (size, icon, etc) and get the error. I have not seen this on other windows versions. vb6 IDE runs fine in windows 7 and 8.1 x64, you just have to run as admin, and hack a bit. my notes say the installer locks up at the end, but everything works anyway. VS6SP6 installer won't run though, so I have a script to manually upgrade the controls from it I need. you can grab these files from your working XP system, add and remove files as you need. c: cd c:\Windows\SysWOW64\ copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\MSWINSCK.* regsvr32 MSWINSCK.OCX /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\MSCOMCT2.* regsvr32 MSCOMCT2.OCX /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\MSFLXGRD.* regsvr32 MSFLXGRD.OCX /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\FM20.* regsvr32 FM20.DLL /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\MSCOMCTL.* regsvr32 MSCOMCTL.OCX /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\TABCTL32.* regsvr32 TABCTL32.OCX /s copy X:\VBRuntime\Win8fix\COMDLG32.* regsvr32 COMDLG32.OCX /s 
so what's the error message?
"Orange" is the only thing that looks odd, but without the whole program I don't know for sure. 
I need to use arrays for this problem though, how would you recommend doing that?
Array of players ;p an array of arrays would work and just have 0 = name, 1 = score, ect. 
For the guy who PM'ed me you would use somthing like this playerList.Remove(New Player() With {.PName = "BoB"}) ' Get rid of bob he sucks to remove the specific item you could also do it via value playerlist.remove(3)
Interesting, I too have always thought whatever you drew on a PictureBox would just overwrite what was there before. I would go with the most obvious answer, that that the bars are being (re)drawn after the black text, I would double-check that isn't happening. Easiest way is to put a breakpoint on the bar-drawing and make sure it is only executing once. 
Does it have to be the FileSystem.GetFiles function? System.IO.Directory contains a GetFiles function that returns a string array: Dim files() As String = System.IO.Directory.GetFiles("C:\temp")
I might be missing the point but... Imports System.IO Module Module1 Sub Main() Dim folderPath As String = "d:\backup\" Dim fileList As List(Of String) = Directory.GetFiles(folderPath).ToList For Each file In fileList Console.WriteLine(file) Next Console.ReadKey() End Sub End Module
Thanks /u/dan1101 ! You saved my day! In a loop the bar was redrawn after the text. 
I would recommend starting here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listbox.multicolumn%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-2
There is also the listview control http://www.dotnetheaven.com/article/listview-control-with-multiple-column-in-vb.net
check the task manager? no sense in guessing at issues. I don't see why Shell would be any problem unless the processes aren't cleanly ending. with Process, shouldn't you do something to cleanly close it? might run out of file handles if not, or not, I've never used it.
When I check task manager I see multiple instances of adb.exe running. Usually from 6 to 12. But I have no idea what it shows hours later when that exception is thrown. I'm not killing the processes I'm creating with the new process command. I thought they automatically closed once the command was executed and the output was returned. Is that not the case? I could see myself missing something obvious like that. 
seems like it's not ending. maybe launch it visible and see what's going on
That's what you've got me thinking too. I made both the Shell and New Process windows visible. When I watch my program run for 5 minutes it seems to be opening and closing windows fairly efficiently, but then it does seem to run okay for anywhere from a few hours to a day before crashing hard so it's unlikely I'll be lucky enough to be watching it when things go horribly wrong. I've changed my New Process code to a Using/End Using block in case that matters. Any idea how many processes VB can typically handle before running out of resources? I can't imagine this program getting up to more than 100 processes at once and I'd think that wouldn't be enough to be problematic on its own.

Thanks a lot :D Man I love-hate this being thrown into the deep end every time I try to do something new in VB.
Hm I don't know if I explained myself well. I'll try with an example. Lets say that in the IDE the picBox has a random size of 456x300, because I didn't want to scroll a lot to see the controls. Now, when the program starts the window will be maximized, and at runtime, the code gets the picBox as a control to work on. It gets the sizing and positions and through those values it draws the x and y axis on the screen. The problem is that the values for the size of the picBox are the ones of the control on the IDE not those on the maximized window, at run time. thus the axis turning out really small. Is this better? is it the same thing? 
If i got this right you have a picture box and on the form load event you are drawing x and y axis on the picbox. When the form resizes the axis stays where you put it in the first place. First thing is to make sure you are drawing on the picbox paint event not on the form load. I usually start with this code. Public Function GetControlSize() As Size Dim tSize As Size Dim mFont As Font = New Font("Marlett", ControlSize) Dim fontSize As Size = TextRenderer.MeasureText("2", mFont) tSize.Width = Padding * 2 + ControlSpacing * 2 + fontSize.Width * 3 tSize.Height = Padding * 2 + fontSize.Height Return tSize End Function Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs) MyBase.OnPaint(e) Dim G As Graphics = e.Graphics G.Clear(BackColor) Size = GetControlSize() Dim maxLeft As Integer = 61 Dim minLeft As Integer = 41 ... the `Size` type stores an ordered pair of integers, which specify a System.Drawing.Size.Height and System.Drawing.Size.Width. this function was for drawing a string on the form, so the `GetControlSize` is checking to see the size in pixels of a specific font for a specific string. in you case you want to on the OnPaint event of your control redraw the axis on the control, given the new size of the `pixBox` Can you post your existing code for drawing the axis, I can help more then :) 
I'm developing a custom control for the graphical display, and if I got this right, I need to raise OnPaint of the picBox and draw my whatever through said event. I'm doing this now: Public Sub Start(ByVal origin As PictureBox) Dim point As New Point Dim el As New GraphicalElement Dim listP As New List(Of Point) If origin.Equals(vbEmpty) Then Throw New ArgumentException("Exception Occured") GoTo exception End If originRef = origin axis.Name = "Axis" 'ponto (0,0) ponto0.X = origin.Bounds.X + graphMargin ponto0.Y = origin.Height + origin.Bounds.Y - graphMargin 'Define Y axis point.X = ponto0.X point.Y = ponto0.Y - origin.Height + 2 * graphMargin el = New GraphicalElement el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) listP.Add(ponto0) listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "line" axis.addElement(el) 'Define X axis point.X = ponto0.X + origin.Width - 2 * graphMargin point.Y = ponto0.Y el = New GraphicalElement el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) listP.Add(ponto0) listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "line" axis.addElement(el) 'Define Y steps point.X = ponto0.X point.Y = ponto0.Y - origin.Height + 2 * graphMargin Dim iStep As Integer = (ponto0.Y - point.Y) / 20 * -1 For i As Integer = ponto0.Y To point.Y Step iStep el = New GraphicalElement el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) point.X = ponto0.X : point.Y = i listP.Add(point) point.X = ponto0.X + 3 : point.Y = i listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "line" axis.addElement(el) Next el = New GraphicalElement 'end cap - triangle el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) point.X = ponto0.X - 3 : point.Y = ponto0.Y - origin.Height + 2 * graphMargin listP.Add(point) point.X = ponto0.X : point.Y = ponto0.Y - origin.Height + 2 * graphMargin - 3 listP.Add(point) point.X = ponto0.X + 3 : point.Y = ponto0.Y - origin.Height + 2 * graphMargin listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "polygon" axis.addElement(el) 'Define X Steps point.X = ponto0.X + origin.Width - 2 * graphMargin point.Y = ponto0.Y For i As Integer = ponto0.X To point.X Step iStep * -1 el = New GraphicalElement el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) point.X = i : point.Y = ponto0.Y listP.Add(point) point.X = i : point.Y = ponto0.Y - 3 listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "line" axis.addElement(el) Next el = New GraphicalElement 'end cap - triangle el.graphPen = New Pen(Brushes.Black, 1) el.isReal = False listP = New List(Of Point) point.X = ponto0.X + origin.Width - 2 * graphMargin : point.Y = ponto0.Y + 3 listP.Add(point) point.X = ponto0.X + origin.Width - 2 * graphMargin + 3 : point.Y = ponto0.Y listP.Add(point) point.X = ponto0.X + origin.Width - 2 * graphMargin : point.Y = ponto0.Y - 3 listP.Add(point) el.GraphPoints = listP el.objectType = "polygon" axis.addElement(el) 'Try : bmp.Dispose() : Catch ex As Exception : End Try bmp = New Bitmap(origin.Bounds.Width, origin.Bounds.Height, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb) graphObjectsList.Add(axis) ReDraw(originRef) origin.Image = bmp isInitialized = True exception: End Sub the ReDraw sub should be done by raising the OnPaint event right?
in the _KeyPress sub, you can check the KeyAscii value for what you want and set it to 0 (KeyAscii=0) when you don't want the pressed (keys) to appear in the box. Also, you need to check pasted values, so in the _OnChange sub there are a few ways of doing this but one would be to look through each character of the text box to see if it is in you accepted chars and build an output string on the matches, then set the value with the build string at the end (only if it's been changed, otherwise your cursor is going to jump around with each key press regardless)
No worries man.
ah I see, you are using GDI+ usually for something like this I would use the [system.drawing.2d namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.drawing2d.aspx) If you want to use GDI+ i would look at this control [GraphSheet Control For Windows](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5571/GraphSheet-Control-for-Windows) by Harish Palaniappan let me go through the code and see what is going on. Back later :) 
oooohhh nice, but as this will be a program to sell, I want to write the code myself, to avoid licensing problems.
Yes it took me a sad amount of time to realize it was a typo and when I fixed it I was still getting a 0 in the worksheet1 M3 cell. on Worksheet 3 M3 the value is 2. I am trying to get that value (of 2) to show up in the M3 of the Worksheet 1
While some consider it "best practice" to refer to spreadsheets by their index number, I find it makes the code more obscure. Are you sure you're using the correct index. Why don't you try referring to the sheet by it's name. Worksheets("WorksheetName").Range("M3").Value
A Listbox can have multiple columns as well as rows. I would suggest you add 9 columns and then it will be easy to do what you want. [listbox multicolumn](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listbox.multicolumn.aspx) Actually as I am thinking about this I would use a GridView control. Then you can take the click events and actually do inline editing. http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/730206/Sudoku-Generator-using-DataGridView 
Thank you thank you thank you. Being the genius that I am I moved the sheets to be 1&gt; 3&gt; 2. My brain made the auto correction that Sheet3 was always 3. Thanks to learning this lesson I will now ALWAYS put the name of the sheet for stability reasons if nothing else. Thank you! 
Ah! Makes sense, I still feel like an idiot for not using the Chart control, or even knowing it's full capabilities. I was creating a whole class library for a custom one. I might still keep at it just for learning purposes. 
I was wondering what happened with that... :) 
No need to do it on the paint event of you are using the control. You can just call a refresh (? i think its called refresh) on the control with an updated dataset, or use a rebind()
Oh it's not for the chart, God no. It for sizing group boxes to the proportions I want. 
This post is bad. You should feel bad.
sounds like something is re-triggering the click event. you don't have an actual loop there.
Ha yea, hence my confusion.
wow, thanks for your detailed answer, ill give it a try! 
It depends upon how you're accessing and utilizing the database. I tend to do everything in code rather than via wizards. I have a basic control class that I made that operates in disconnected mode and can perform all standard, parameterized commands and queries (read, update, insert, delete, etc.). I'd be happy to share if interested, and could probably slap together a simple demo project for you for VB.NET 2010.
Well there is a login page Imports System.Threading Public Class Login Dim a As New Process Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click a.StartInfo.FileName = "C:\Program Files\reflection\default scripts\as400.rsf" a.Start() Thread.Sleep(1000) SendKeys.SendWait(TextBox1.Text) Thread.Sleep(1000) SendKeys.SendWait("{TAB}") Thread.Sleep(1000) SendKeys.SendWait(TextBox2.Text) Thread.Sleep(1000) SendKeys.SendWait("{ENTER}") Me.Hide() MainMenu.Show() Exit Sub End Sub End Class Which opens Main Menu Public Class MainMenu Private Sub RestartWriters_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles RestartWriters.Click Me.Hide() Form1.Show() End Sub End Class Then the form I provided Imports System.Threading Imports System.Windows.Forms Public Class Form1 Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Thread.Sleep(1000) System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send("ENDWTR WTR{(}PRTFP03BC{)} OPTION{(}{*}IMMED{)} {ENTER}") Thread.Sleep(1000) System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send("STRRMTWTR PRTFP03BC {ENTER}") Exit Sub End Sub End Class That's all I have so far because the app will be useless if I can't prevent the looping :)
I tried this yesterday, and it didn't work - still tries to use the old server.
generally anything in form load is going to increase your startup times. if you want to over-optimize, load only what's needed in form load and fire off a thread or timer to pre-load the rest. 
I like the second solution you provided. You can also replace Debug.Print with MsgBox("Text goes here") if the program isn't displaying the debug text.
Thanks for the reply! I would LOVE if you shared your code. I am just starting to work with access and visual studio. I made this application thing in excel and vba already, but there are some issues that I cannot work around in excel. Like I want several users to be able to use the program at the same time. Excel wont let me do that without messing stuff up. But yea, would be awesome if you shared :)
I will try that. Thank you for helping. Much appreciated :)
json.net 
Thanks for this info. I've definitely witnessed timing issues using sendkeys. The login only seems to work half the time because of this. I figured it was a known issue but hadn't verified it. 
It's a very secure way of doing things and allows all sorts of control over what is sent and stored in the database, how it is accessed, etc. You could write one stored procedure to cover several functions (to do similar things) and then on access, send it the function you want. mycmdName.parameters.AddWithValue("@function", 1) 
I don't have any code in the combo box's for the the selected index change event handler. So it's doing it all on it's own. I tried doing it like this. 1. Change to LG 2. Clear the Model Combobox 3. Clear the Size Combobox 4. Assign database to Model Combobox 5. Assign Display Member as Model 6. Assign database to Size Combobox 7. Assign Display Member as Size But that still caused the same exact issues i was having before. :(
It's done through relationships. Visual studio is smart enough to realise that when i select Apple the model drop box should only show ones that have that Make ID associated with it. I don't have any code for the index change event handler or any SQL statments. 
&gt; This is for only 99 numbers and these are the codes we can only use. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Public Class Form1 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private Sub btnClose_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnClose.Click &gt; &gt; Me.Close() &gt; &gt; End Sub &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private Sub btnPlay_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnPlay.Click &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Val(txtnumber.Text) &gt; 100 Then &gt; &gt; MsgBox("ERROR: Input 2 digits only.") &gt; &gt; Else &gt; &gt; txtnumber.Text = txtnumber.Text &gt; &gt; End If &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "1" Then txtoutput.Text = "One" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "2" Then txtoutput.Text = "Two" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "3" Then txtoutput.Text = "Three" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "4" Then txtoutput.Text = "Four" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "5" Then txtoutput.Text = "Five" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "6" Then txtoutput.Text = "Six" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "7" Then txtoutput.Text = "Seven" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "8" Then txtoutput.Text = "Eight" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "9" Then txtoutput.Text = "Nine" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "10" Then txtoutput.Text = "Ten" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "11" Then txtoutput.Text = "Eleven" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "12" Then txtoutput.Text = "Twelve" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "13" Then txtoutput.Text = "Thirteen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "14" Then txtoutput.Text = "Fourteen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "15" Then txtoutput.Text = "Fifteen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "16" Then txtoutput.Text = "Sixteen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "17" Then txtoutput.Text = "Seventeen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "18" Then txtoutput.Text = "Eighteen" &gt; &gt; If txtnumber.Text = "19" Then txtoutput.Text = "Nineteen" &gt; &gt; Dim txtA As String &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; txtA = TextBox1.Text &gt; &gt; Dim txtE, txtC, txtD, txtG As String &gt; &gt; txtC = txtA.Substring(0, 1) &gt; &gt; txtD = txtA.Substring(1, 1) &gt; &gt; If txtD = 1 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = " One" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 2 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = "Two" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 3 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = "Three" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 4 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = "Four" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 5 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = "Five" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 6 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = "Six" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 7 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = " Seven" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 8 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = " Eight" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtD = 9 Then &gt; &gt; txtE = " Nine" &gt; &gt; Else &gt; &gt; End If &gt; &gt; If txtC = 2 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Twenty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 3 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Thirty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 4 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Forty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 5 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Fifty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 6 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Sixty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 7 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Seventy" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 8 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Eighty" &gt; &gt; ElseIf txtC = 9 Then &gt; &gt; txtG = "Ninety" &gt; &gt; Else &gt; &gt; txtG = "Error" &gt; &gt; txtE = "" &gt; &gt; End If &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TextBox3.Text = txtG + txtE &gt; &gt; End Sub &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; End Class 
If it's just 99 words and is a one time thing you can do the If txt.text = 1 then, Elseif txt.text = 2 then ect. If you're able to you could also choose to do a Select case. Might be less to write, but still have to go word by word.
our teacher gave us 1-99999. How can I able to do that??

Well, there must be some code or SQL statements powering the change, they were just buit by VS instead of explicetly writen by you. Maybe I have a tin-foil hat on but I am always a little leery of allowing VS to write this level of logic, I would rather know what my code is doing. Manually setting the dropdowns through index changed event handlers would be the route I would take to fix this problem. Sorry I don't have an answer that is more closely tied to your currennt program structure. 
Thanks man :) 
There are two type of hot keys there are ones that are tied and are only available when a specific object is in focus, usually a form and then there are the ones that are available globaly. The first type is the easiest, you use the form events, and capture the input in the `KeyDown` event. Private Sub frmCustomerDetails_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load ' When the form loads, the KeyPreview property is set to True. ' This lets the form capture keyboard events before ' any other element in the form. Me.KeyPreview = True End Sub Private Sub frmCustomerDetails_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles MyBase.KeyDown If (e.Alt AndAlso (e.KeyCode = Keys.P)) Then ' When Alt + P is pressed, the Click event for the print ' button is raised. RaiseEvent btnPrintCustomerDetails.Click End If End Sub Some will argue that the `KeyPreview` is not important, I find it very important for it allows the keys to work no matter what is focused on the given form. Here is more information about [Capturing shortcut keys](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/839201) The second type where you are intercepting keys globally, so that you can capture events even when you are using a sdiffrent app take a bit more work. There are a couple of methods for this. I like using the `GetAsyncKeyState` Here is a very detailed article over at [dreamincode](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/94406-global-hotkey/) There is another method called `RegisterHotKey` that uses less processing power, for you are not using a loop to pole the keys. I find that this can be hit and miss in certain applications that use DirectX. Meaning in certain games your key combinations will not be received by your program for somthing is happening that is blocking it. Anwyays the [Microsoft Foums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/c1a24688-d844-4adc-9d85-416a7158c6ba/faq-how-do-i-register-a-hotkey-in-vbnet) have a great chunk of code. 
If you're talking vb6 then you need to use the ItemData collection to assign a reference number to each item. Private Sub Form_Load() List.AddItem "Blue" List.ItemData(List.NewIndex) = 123 List.AddItem "Red" List.ItemData(List.NewIndex) = 456 List.AddItem "Green" List.ItemData(List.NewIndex) = 789 End Sub Private Sub List_DblClick() If List.ListIndex &gt;= 0 Then MsgBox "You Selected Item " &amp; List.List(List.ListIndex) &amp; " With ID " &amp; CStr(List.ItemData(List.ListIndex)) Else MsgBox "No Item Selected" End If End Sub
Good call, eliminating COM is always good, and Late Binding is a nightmare! I haven't actually done any Office Automation in a dozen years or so (using third party components instead), so wasn't sure of the current state of OA. 
Yea, I would love to switch to something better, there is a strict requirement for use of Word, and have changed it drastically over time, hopefully this puts this problem to rest.
Not sure, haha. Basically I have a word document that is pre-created stored in the resources, when I run the "export" feature it copies that report out of the resources, opens it and copies text from the vb.net form and puts it into the word document, it then saves that word document.
The thing you are looking for is "Consume REST Service VB.net" in your Googleing. Rest services are just more loosely defined web service implementations. Web services use [SOAP](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/SOAP) and web api tend to be more loose and use [REST](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Representational_state_transfer#/Uniform_interface) here a couple of links [Using the REST Services with .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819168.aspx) [Create and Consume RESTFul Service in .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/255684/Create-and-Consume-RESTFul-Service-in-NET-Framewor)
hmmm, I may have to look into that. I am not a pro with vb.net in the slightest and it took me forever to get word working, I will check youtube for some videos, I am sure there is one out there! Thanks!
thanks!
yes, but I'm not trying to create an api. I just want to utilize an existing one.
I'm not sure what other prerequisites I could add, any suggestions? I tried disabling/enabling and it gave the same result. Not sure where to go from here. 
As the others pointed out, the reason for the exception is a text value that can't be parsed (in your case to a double). A handy way to parse strings to numbers are the TryParse functions (e.g. [Double.TryParse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/994c0zb1.aspx)). Something like that: Dim numberofdays As String = TextBoxDays.Text Dim numberofdaysdouble As Double If Not Double.TryParse(numberofdays, numberofdaysdouble) Then ' React to the invalid input and Return End If
Here is a standard algorthm for doing what you want. I understood you when you said you had to use `IF Then` I just cant stand crap like that. So here is a better way to do it.

Yep any time you find yourself doing repetitive work on a computer, ask yourself if there is a more concise/automated way to do it. 
Start at the back of the string (path) and walk backwards one character at a time. When you get to the first \, start appending the characters to a new string. When you get to the next \, you're done. Reverse that string (or instead prepend the characters on the string you're building up) and you're good to go. There are far more elegant ways but that will get done what you need.
this will return nothing, and empty string.
split the full path on "\" and concat the last 2 array elements to get the dir and file.
the docs disagree https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.getfilename(v=vs.110).aspx 
I just tried it. It did return Scripts. Though my brain is still trying to reason why. Maybe because it's late Friday afternoon. I'm going to use this, I'll just need to concatenate it with the file name at some point.
Try this: Sub Main Dim fullPath = "G:\Program Files (x86)\Application Folder\Documentation\readme_en.txt" Dim subPath = ExtractSubPath(fullPath, "G:\Program Files (x86)\Application Folder\") Debug.Print(subPath) ' prints "Documentation\readme_en.txt" End Sub Public Function ExtractSubPath(fullPath As String, basePath As String) As String If Not basePath.EndsWith(IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar) Then basePath &amp;= IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar Dim baseUri = New Uri(basePath), fullUri = New Uri(fullPath) Dim relativeUri = baseUri.MakeRelativeUri(fullUri) Return relativeUri.ToString().Replace("/", IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar) 
It's not complicated. `GetDirectoryName` returns everything except the last segment of the path ("E:\Git\AI_Aide\AICore_ManifestGenerator\bin\Debug\Scripts"), and `GetFileName` returns the last segment of that path ("Scripts"). They're just string functions, they don't care whether what you're looking for is really a file or a directory.
This works. With one exception. The path of E:\Git\AI_Aide\AICore_ManifestGenerator\bin\Debug\MyProg.exe returns Debug, which is exactly what it's supposed to. Except I want to treat this as the root directory. So the directory structure (eventually in production) will look like this: \ \Graphics \SQL \Database \Logs This is for an updater/launcher (I know, use ClickOnce) so the executables will reside in the root of the install and the appropriate files get put into their places.
Thank you I didn't know about the val function, which is a huge help.
How do you recommend dealing with processes that need more than 3 parameters then? Split everything up into smaller functions? 
Still writing this up. When dealing with more than 3 you use a parameter array. If all the values are a series you can use a simple array. Public Function sumNumbers(ByVal numbers() As Integer) As Integer dim retVal as integer For each num in numbers retVal += num Next End Function use this to call function Dim addNumbers() As Integer = New Integer() {1,2,3,4,5} Dim largestNumber As Integer = sumNumbers(testNumbers) In complex situations you use a ParamArray Sub studentScores(ByVal name As String, ByVal ParamArray scores() As String) Debug.WriteLine("Scores for " &amp; name &amp; ":" &amp; vbCrLf) ' Use UBound to determine largest subscript of the array. For i As Integer = 0 To UBound(scores, 1) Debug.WriteLine("Score " &amp; i &amp; ": " &amp; scores(i)) Next i End Sub Call studentScores("Anne", "10", "26", "32", "15", "22", "24", "16") Call studentScores("Mary", "High", "Low", "Average", "High") Dim JohnScores() As String = {"35", "Absent", "21", "30"} Call studentScores("John", JohnScores) I am still working on a param array with custom type so that you can send multiple types into the method. This should give you the base idea.
Your code is trying to hard, really to check a pallindrom you want to check if is even, for an odd numbers can not be a pallindrom, if it is even split is in half and compare the reveresed sets without spaces. My original post on this; Function check(ByVal s As String) As Boolean Dim len As Integer = s.Length For i As Integer = 0 To len / 2 If Not s(i) = s(len - 1 - i) Then Return False End If Next Return True End Function Turns out it wont process , ' . or " " So i moved to this. Public Function IsPalindrome_new(src As String) As Boolean Dim palindrome As Boolean = True For i As Integer = 0 To src.Length \ 2 If src(i) &lt;&gt; src(src.Length - i - 1) Then palindrome = False Exit For End If Next Return palindrome End Function The u/Vectronic posted the best version in RegEx Public Function IsPalindrome(ByVal Input As String) As Boolean Return System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace(Input.ToUpper, "[^A-Z]", "") = _ System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace(String.Join("", Input.Split().Reverse).ToUpper, "[^A-Z]", "") End Function
So I attempted to use the second code you gave me and it still didn't accept ' , and the like
Thanks for the short writeup! I'm still new to coding but I am working on a simple chart macro in excel where I bring a bunch of parameters into the function to format the chart and I think this will help clean it up a lot.
Where is that if statement? Is it being called when a key is pressed? Under the form_keydown event add the code to check for the specific button, this way the code is run when a key is pressed. Also, the best way to a button trigger is button1.performclick but what you have works fine
After looking at the pastebin link, try putting it under me.previewkey, and use the code 'if e.key code = keyiwant'. Don't forget to change the forms keypreview property to true in the designer
My take on it: Function IsPalindrome(Text As String) As Boolean text = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.replace(text.toupper, "[^A-Z]", "") Return text = Microsoft.VisualBasic.StrReverse(text) End Function 
I found replace Fromimage with FileStream how can I do??
It's probably your "string" in your OSVERSIONINFO that's giving you trouble. Have you considered using System.Diagnostic's FileVersionInfo? It has a GetVersionInfo method that will return a FileVersionInfo object with all the same information you're trying to get from GetVersionEx (it probably calls it for you behind the scenes.) I tend to prefer using the framework instead of direct Win32 calls when possible...
oh boy I remember having to do this one. have you gotten through learning how to save or add anything to a text file?
no... we have just done random number gen from 0-99 and then save it and recall all the numbers... our teacher is hopeless which actually teaching us things.
 Imports System.IO Public Class Form1 Private Sub btnGO_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnGO.Click Dim fs As New FileStream("name.txt", FileMode.Create) Dim sw As New StreamWriter(fs) sw.WriteLine(txtName.Text) sw.Close() End Sub End Class It should look like this. If you want to add more names on different lines, make sure that the MultiLine property of the textfield is set on true. 
I think it'd be best to override `OnMouseMove` to call `Invalidate()`, and override `OnPaint` to do the actual drawing of the lines. You must perform any interaction with the UI on the main thread, doing it on another thread will throw an exception. In theory you could draw the lines to a `Bitmap` in a separate thread and then draw that bitmap to the picture box on the UI thread, but that would actually be much slower than just drawing the lines directly due the overhead of threading and copying the bitmap, and would only make sense if the drawing was extremely CPU intensive to the point where it would noticeably freeze the UI.
Thank you, that's what I was hoping was best :D
I've tried this already, no result. Something also I've found out, if I type the direct path in Process, which looks like this: Process.Start("Excel.exe", C:\Desktop\Book1.xlsx\' Then I do get what I want and it opens. But if I do: Process.Start("Excel.exe", uploadComboBox.selectedItem) I get nothing.
This worked perfectly. Thanks bro. Is there any way for me to add a "Show Path" button and then it changed the fileName to the Directory? Inside of the combo box I mean.
I got is solved already lol, but thank you.
Have you got experience with any other programming languages?
I have been exposed to other languages and can do basic functions. I know it isn't a coding language but html and css is going to be the closest thing that I can work with
Really I think the best thing you can do is get used to the development environment ( Visual Studios ) and do some tutorials you can find online like these: http://www.visual-basic-tutorials.com/ If you are having a hard time understanding a concept in one of the tutorials then come back and ask questions here.
Thanks I'll check these out
Yea, I figured I would go away from Word, which I have no issue doing. I was playing around with asp.net in visual studio and saw you can host directly in Azure, so will probably end up doing it there. Any suggestions on good places to start learning about ASP.net?
http://www.asp.net/ is a good starting point.
This seems promising, thanks, but how do I actually check the bytes values (I'm not familiar with byte arrays)?
"bytes" is a byte array, so you can manipulate each byte like this: For i = 0 To bytes.Count - 1 If bytes(i) = 65 Then bytes(i) = 66 Next This, for example, would change all bytes of value 65 to 66. 
Thanks, you've really helped :) The process is now pretty much instant.
I think the source of the issue is that numbers chosen to replace duplicate numbers aren't themselves checked for duplicates. For example, imagine the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]. 2 is checked against 5, 4 and 3 successfully. Now the last 2 is recognized as a duplicate of the first 2, and it happens to get replaced with a 5. Lastly, the new 5 is checked against 2 and 1 and passes, even though there is a second 5 later on in the array. You could try to fix this to do a complete check each time, but this method isn't great anyway. A much simpler (and quicker) solution would be to fill the array sequentially with the allowed numbers, and then apply a Fisher-Yates shuffle which is quite easy to implement. That way you are guaranteed to have no duplicates, and you only need to loop through the array once.
What you're trying to do is called a "shuffle". Instead of generating random numbers and checking if you've seen them previously, it's easier to generate the 13 numbers in order and then swap them randomly. Dim rnd = New System.Random Dim card = Enumerable.Range(1, 13).OrderBy(Function(x) rnd.Next).ToArray This will create a "range" of 1 to 13, then shuffle them by "ordering" them using rnd.Next. Finally, ".ToArray" converts the shuffled range to the array you need. The previous code is in "modern VB" style; if you prefer something more "classic", it looks like this: Dim card = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13} Dim rnd = New System.Random For i = card.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1 Dim j = rnd.Next(0, i) 'swap Dim tmp = card(j) card(j) = card(i) card(i) = tmp Next Either one gets the job done. The key is to swap existing values instead of trying to randomly generate them without duplicates. With 13 values, the random method can be made to work, but if you had 10,000,000 values, imagine how long it would take to randomly generate the last few values and the time wasted continuously checking for previous values.
Is using Trim(sString.toUpper) generally cleaner than using Trim(Ucase(sString))? It looks a bit easier to read to me, don't know if there's any other advantages though (didn't ever think to look into string methods).
This is a style thing at this point. Both are easily readable and understandable. I prefer using the string class `ToUpper` over the `Ucase` function. I agree with you the the `ToUpper` is a bit easier to read. 
maybe it's possible, but it's not what you'd normally do. just do it in the app. use calculated columns when the calculation is important to the database schema, not for formatting GUI output.
you make task scheduler show the window. you might have to wrap it in a .bat file. you'd need to make a UI to stop the MP3, or launch it externally like you do the browser with a player than can auto-repeat. vlc might work. or, see if you can set a repeat option on the wmplayer object and use a msgbox like one of the comments on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1569765/how-to-play-audio-file-on-windows-from-command-line
Just curious because you solved your problem. What are you trying to do in this line: If TransactionNumBox.Text &lt;&gt; 0 Then Are you really checking for "0" not in the textbox or are you just checking to see if there is any text in the textbox?
it's possibly using so much javascripty stuff that the DOM clicks aren't bubbling right. you may have to decipher what gets called via the onclick and call that manually. might even be easier to trace what it's doing and just manually submit a form or whatever.
I've got a working solution. I'm not 100% happy with it, but 'it'll do'. If I want anything more from it, I'll probably use it as an excuse to learn C. http://pastebin.com/RPgL3JNF Some odd behaviour of the popup though; while the mp3 is playing, the timer seems to be either paused or drastically slowed; 1 second is more like 4-5. It also doesn't assert on top after the first one, so I can't just open the laptop and mash the keyboard. Probably for the best...
I moved the database to C:\ yes, no folder, just like it was on V:\ before (mapped drive). Funny thing I just tried to run as admin and it just doesn't give me the option to do that. There's something about the date tho that I might check tomorrow since it's 1am for me here in Spain. All computers at work are in Spanish so they have Spanish date format while my computers are in English with of course, English date format and since I downgraded from Win10 to 7 back again I forgot to restore date format to Spanish, which I'll do tomorrow. The access database create a few tables from the data provided by the software that does the data mining, this software create tables labeled ie00800110012015, ie is the initials of the company that made the software, the series of numbers represent a set of specific data (dates, minutes, operators, etc) and the final 4 numbers being the year. Sadly, I just got everything as it is, without any knowledge of VB or programming, so I'm learning as I go and can, sometimes I wish I could design everything myself to be simpler (I have some ideas by now and I know the current coding is a cluster fuck of gazillion unnecessary code, I already scrapped almost half, something I do every new year when I start to re-code the year) I practically run the little company, my boss just pays me and "yes/no" me from time to time when I give some ideas, so everything is just because I just want to make things a bit easier for me, with boss' blessings. Thanks for the help, will report back tomorrow.
Okay, I will try the onclick.
Hey you were a great help! I've found about it from that link of yours :)
Sorry, misread your code! I'm not familiar with tableadaptermanager!
:( thanks btw. :)
I can't see all your code, but it doesn't look like you have an instance of TableAdapterManager: Dim tam as New TableAdapterManager tam.MyTableTableAdapter = New MyTableTableAdapter tam.UpdateAll(Me.MydatabaseDataSet) Something like that anyway, I never worked with it before, but reading the [documentation here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb629327.aspx) it looks like this should set you on the right track.
Sorry got busy in another direction. Couldn't you just leave the textbox empty and see if it: String.IsNullOrEmpty(TransactionNumBox.Text)
Why not back up all the data and do a clean install of 8.1, i.e. wiping out the OS and installing 8.1? Sounds like there are a lot of undiscovered landmines that may be in your system.
I run 2 dedicated VMWare images for daily development (one for my code, and one for a large client). I also have two older images of retired environments (that get spun up every now and then), along with a number of test environments. I've been doing all development in VMWare daily for about 6 years, and see no reason to ever move back to the "bare metal" installation. For instance, the SATA ports on my motherboard failed last month and I had to replace it with a different manufacturer / model. I tried to SysPrep the drive, but something went wrong and I had to reload Windows from scratch. It took several days to get it put back together, but I was able to install VMWare first and go right back to work while putting the rest back together. Same thing for upgrades ... I moved both VMs to 10 a few weeks ago. Started by creating a snapshot of the VM, and installed 10. In the end everything went super smooth, but if I had any issues the snapshot would have had the VM back to the exact state it was in before the upgrade in 2 minutes (not a rollback of the Windows installation, but the exact untouched VM image from before I started). The main reason I use VMWare over any of the others it supports multi monitor setups inside the VM. 
Cool. I'm cheap, so I'll stick with HV for now. ;) Thanks for helping me take the leap! 
I just rdp into my vm et voila dual monitors 
I'm sure more visualization tools support it now, but they didn't back when I first started running VMs, so I went with VMWare. 
You can connect to many different data sources. This website gives you examples. http://www.connectionstrings.com 
I'll come back with better resources later, but I believe this should be a good place to start: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx I haven't tried it yet, I'll do so next time I'm in front of a computer, so it may just be a page explaining how to build Office plugins. If that is the case I'll update this post.
you can use a multi-line text box and append the results instead of replacing
Pre-pend. That way when it adds a new one, it's always at the top instead of forcing you to scroll to the bottom to see the new entry.
thanks dude
You can use .Insert to specify where to add the items. Specifying "0" will put them at the 1st spot: ListBox1.Items.Insert(0, "Foo") For the second part, you can use .ItemHeight and .ClientSize.Height to check if the number of items will exceed the visual capacity of the box: If ListBox1.Items.Count * ListBox1.ItemHeight &gt; ListBox1.ClientSize.Height Then ListBox1.Items.RemoveAt(ListBox1.Items.Count - 1) End If
The "X16" part of the .ToString pads the hex number out to 16 places, taking care of the formatting and conversion at the same time. From the question's wording, I think the decimal is displayed normally, without leading zeroes.
TIL. Thanks. :)
No error messages -- basically the application does nothing when trying to open it. I've seen that happen before when trying to open a 64-bit application on a 32-bit machine, but not a x64 app on a x64 machine. The application does reference 3 different libraries, but those are also set to AnyCPU as the target platform (also with the "Prefer 32 bit" option unchecked). Even if they were 32-bit dlls, I would be a bit confused about why the built application would run on my machine using this configuration, but not anyone else's.
What are the 3 libraries? Can you test the app without the libraries?
Make sure that library is being compiled as 33/64 bit. 
If the library is being compiled under AnyCPU, shouldn't this ensure that it can flip either between 32/64 bit depending on how the application launhes? I genuinely don't know the answer to this, so it might be something here that I'll have to try.
I'd give it a try. I know when it comes to unmanaged langauges (C++) if I write a 32bit application, I can't access anything from a 64bit application. Additionally, I also know that process.getmodules (or whatever) will only return 32bit or 64bit modules depending on if your program is 32 or 64 bit.
You'll have to put "number" at the form level; in the code above, it's local to Form_Load.
Not enough information. What is in the code window, an error? You could also check to see what your startup form is. 
Have you tried anything? Are you stuck because you don't know how to compute an average, or because you do but don't know how to code it? Not trying to be snarky here, just wondering at what step you're getting stuck. If you were to write down in plain english how to calculate the average, how would you do it?
Stuck? Event handlers take all of 10 seconds to create. Google is your friend. You need to convert the scores from text in the textbox to double and divide by how many boxes you have. You should probably use double.tryparse and if the input is not valid, show to user. Go read how to use that method on msdn.
This link may be useful: http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/NET/nets12p1.html Also don't be shy to peruse around MSDN.
You would need to declare number outside the load event.
What does the string from Clipboard.GetText() look like?
Pi r^2 xD
You could easily do this with VB.NET. You'll need a place to store the data day by day (a database would be great for this), a way to enter the data (controls and forms will cover this), a way to query the data into it's final form for export (via the DB, and probably some classes), and a way to export it to Excel (there are a number of ways to go about this, ranging from creating a CSV file, to directly manipulating a running instance of Excel). 
That's a huge part of my background as well. We do POS, so full timeclock, exports, reporting, overtime, integration, etc. 
Awesome, I appreciate the input! This gives me an active project to learn with. Something I am interested in, So I will have something to apply it to and actually learn something! I am sure I will be checking back in get advice in the future. And thanks again!
It can be done easily in .NET, but the average office worker won't have Visual Studio on their machine, or the ability to install applications. Access VBA is probably OP's best bet here because it won't require compiling and installing an executable and it already has all of the database engine capabilities at hand for the data entry and reporting. 
You should consider making it open-source. If you run into any issues, we can help with bug fixes.
Use the in-built vba of Excel or other .msoffice application 
apparently not, but I havnt tried 
Possibly, adding a "new" to the declaration: Shared xcl As New Excel.Application 
yep, but the reference isnt wrong in the code. I'm using chrome in brazilian-portuguese and miscorrected it. Tks!
For the database, you would probably want to look at SQL server express and set up tables, views, stored procedures, etc... 
Registration is required for this evaluation. Please choose a file type: Azure ISO CAB what shall i pick?
I am not entirely sure what you mean but for some more detail Win7 vb2010 I have tried to make an application but it saved as 3 files not a .vbproj but as a .resx which only has the icon currently the .designer.vb which has the code for the visual side and buttons ect. And I have a .vb with the code I wrote for the application and I can't open it as it was before only as separate parts 
You don't even need to create new files with the same name. Just create the project, copy the three files into the folder, and then use the "show all files" button in Solution Explorer. Once you can see the existing files, right click and select Include in Project. 
No I don't see it in projects or any project file
Then the above method of creating another project is probably the best: Start VS Create a new forms project, give it a name, and save it. Open the folder for the new project, and go into the folder with the source files. Copy your three files into the new project folder. If you overwrite existing files (if your form has the same name as the original), then just restart vs, and reload the project. If you didn't overwrite them, then go to Solution Explorer in VS, and click the Show All Files icon (in the top row of solution explorer). Then you should see the existing files in Solution Explorer. Right click on the .VB (the main form file), and select "include in project". Then save and you should be good to go. If your file was renamed, you may need to delete the extra form, and change the startup item. 
Make sure you have KeyPreview = true on the form
Ok so I do this but the files don't show at first until in the solution explorer I click show all files. The files I added are there but they have no icon and there is no option to add the files to the form
Can you give me some more information? what is shpplayer? a picturebox? keep in mind you need to force the form to redraw. Your positions could be updating but if you aren't redrawing the form every time something moves you won't know. Just food for thought.
well i just changed the keycode to wasd and nothing else and it worked so I have no idea why arrow keys don't work
keycode &lt;&gt; keychar, maybe that had something to do with it? was it keys.w or "w"
No. The last version of VS that could open a .vbp was 2008
That's really weird. Somehow your arrow keys aren't registering the same keycode. I would love for you to put a breakpoint on the select case and hover over e.keycode and see what it's value is. Interesting
Since you're still having this problem (I assume), here's a working piece of code. Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Me.KeyPreview = True End Sub Private Sub HandleInput(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles MyBase.KeyDown Select Case e.KeyCode Case Keys.W YourObject.Top -= Y Case Keys.S YourObject.Top += Y Case Keys.A YourObject.Left -= X Case Keys.D YourObject.Left += X End Select End Sub
That sounds simple enough, I'll look into it. Thanks man
Can't remember off the top of my head but isn't there a property of the textbox that you set to only accept numeric input? Edit: apparently not. Stack overflow has quite a few posts about this tho. 
Is this a school project? There are a lot of guides out there you know. 
I've got the basic calculator but i don't know how to get pi or square. 
I tried finding a guide but i can't find one with pi and square.
Have you looked at the system.math library? https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/thc0a116.aspx
You can get the value of pi with System.Math.Pi
I can't because when i save and open the file i can't see any scripts. It also won't let me run it.
Is the DPI the same on both machines? Screen shots would probably help visualize what's going on. You really shouldn't code for a resolution, but should be using containers to lay out controls so that they resize appropriately at different resolutions. If you need true resolution independence I'd look into WPF instead of Winforms. 
Thanks for the input. This app is only going to be running on a 1024x768 machine so I dont need it to be adjustable. Why would the DPI effect the program? Arent both resolutions the same on both computers?
When I create board games, I usually don't work with the "tag" property. Furthermore, I recommend not using a 2-dimensional array of buttons, but rather adding buttons in your program's runtime. Private Sub CreateGrid() For i = 1 To 16 Dim nb as new Button() nb.name = "b" &amp; i nb.size = new Size(btnSize, btnSize) nb.Left= btnSize + i*btnSize - Int((i - 1) / 4) * btnSize * 4 nb.Top= btnSize + Int((i - 1) / 4) * btnSize Controls.Add(nb) AddHandler nb.Click, AddressOf Grid_Click Next End Sub This way, you can adress each button by its name: Controls("b" &amp; 10).Backcolor = Color.Black changes the Color of the Button in the 3rd row and 2nd col ( You just count "linewise") Private Sub Grid_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Dim curr as Integer = Mid(sender.name, 2) Dim row as Integer = Int((curr - 1) / 4) + 1 Dim col as Integer = ((curr - 1) mod 4) + 1 If row = randomRow And col = randomCol Then sender.backColor = Color.Black End If End Sub I don't know much about Threading in VB, so I suggest you leave out Dim elapTimer As New Threading.Timer(AddressOf tick, Nothing, 1000, 1000) Dim stpw As Stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew and just add a Timer Control in the Toolbox in the Form. In the Properties, you can set the Intervall(ms) of the Timer and set the Enabled property to True. If you set its Intervall to 1000, just add in its code Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick Label1.Text += 1 'just seconds, but w/e End Sub Do the Button1 Event as following Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim rnd as new Random randomRow = rnd.next(1,5) Textbox1.Text = randomRow randomCol = rnd.next(1,5) Textbox2.Text = randomCol 'Why did you use a for loop? End Sub Tell me if it works!
I'm still waking up, but why do you set the value of position in this else statement? Else position = InStr(1,Message, CloseText)
Again, I'm still not thinking with a full pot of coffee, but the way you're using the int "position" in this program is strange to me, because as far as I've noticed you're just using it as a return value for instr to tell if you've found a substring in another string, which you then do a second evaluation to see if position is &gt; 0.. In case you weren't aware, you could use it this way: if InStr(Message, OpenText) &gt; 0 then (match found) that will cut down on your embedded if statements which can make easy mistakes harder to find imo. 
I'm starting to get busy at work so I don't know if I will get a chance to really dig in and help, but I want to tell you that using timers and sleep together in VB6 is a risky proposition; especially sleep. All sort of counter intuitive things can happen and only under odd circumstances which will make you pull your hair out. I would advocate busting out the MSDN reference for the MSCOM object and looking for events that are triggered when it's done sending / receiving data and follow those events explicitly instead of trusting timers &amp; sleep. 
Ah, fair enough, did not know I could use it this way - as for using the int to set the position, I actually thought I had to; I'm "new" to visual basic as stated, so I've had to "learn" quickly and have been looking through examples and such that I've been able to find, and this was the easiest understandable one I found of using it - now that you've explained how it works I can see it's silly, but I actually figured that the 1 position was used to check against the &gt;0 to see if the text was in the line or not. 
The issue I found was that the computer works faster than the modem itself; I use the timers to run the program, but even with Oncomm events, unless I add brief moments of time in between the different things firing, all I get is garbled messages that gets sent through; I need a few milliseconds between the lines in the Sendmsg method or I end up with only half of the text going through because it makes the calls too quick for the hardware to keep up as far as I can tell. I'll try and look into it and see if I can do it in another way, though. Thanks for the heads up :) Appreciated.
You can use an array: Dim array(4, 4) As String ' 0..4, 0..4, so 5x5 For i = 0 To 4 For j = 0 To 4 array(i,j) = "Text " &amp; i &amp; ", " &amp; j ' initialize however you want Next Next So your first button can read array(0, x); the 2nd button can read array(1, x); and so on where "x" is the set of text you want to display.
Isn't it just a setting in the ControlBox window? (Sorry, running out for a bit, no time to dig)
it was set to false. i set it to true and im still getting nothing. Once I ran the code below it went away Protected Overloads Overrides ReadOnly Property CreateParams() As CreateParams Get Dim param As CreateParams = MyBase.CreateParams param.ClassStyle = param.ClassStyle Or &amp;H200 Return param End Get End Property
Setting the ControlBox property to False only works if the form's text is empty. Otherwise, the property has no effect
its web based so that feature is disabled. either way you go that is disabled. hence the need for the template program
 strSubject = "" If chk1.value = 1 and chk2.value = 1 then strSubject = "Both Checked" elseif chk1.value = 1 then strSubject = "Chk1 Checked" elseif chk2.value = 1 then strSubject = "Chk2 Checked" end if This will amend the strSubject variable depending on which checkboxes are checked. The method you use to apply this to the subject line of your email will differ on when the code is being run; are you wanting users to press a button when on a blank new email, or do you want to automatically show it whenever they open a new message? I'm sure there are more elegant methods of implementing the same code as above (I've never really played with 'case' statements, not sure what the advantage is over if/elseif), I'm always happy to learn more if someone has a better solution.
OK, so it sounds like you want to create a new mail through your form. That's much easier. I'd usually recommend using radio buttons instead of checkboxes, but this is a very simple method of doing it; Private sub NewMail() Dim objNewMail as outlook.mailitem strSubject = "" If chk1.value = 1 and chk2.value = 1 then msgbox "Please uncheck one option" exit sub elseif chk1.value = 1 then strSubject = "Kick Back" elseif chk2.value = 1 then strSubject = "Long call" end if set objNewMail = outlook.createitem(olMailItem) objNewMail.subject = strSubject objNewMail.display End Sub Put a command button on your form, point it at that sub and it should do the trick. You'll just need to rename the checkboxes from chk1/chk2 to whatever they are in your form.
You want Clipboard.GetText(TextDataFormat.UnicodeText)
forgot a ToString() when you putting the variable in the text box
Hm. Try commenting the 'as outlook.mailitem' section. Not strictly needed, but I always like to keep it tidy. Just to confirm; are you writing this in Outlook's VBA or as a vbscript?
Here is the code used to launch the form: Sub AddMyForm() Dim Items As Outlook.Items Dim Item As Object Set Items = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Items Set Item = Items.Add("IPM.Note.test") Item.Display
it complies and run right for me, the only thing I can think of is the space between WriteLine and (
Would that actually affect it? The website I got it from did the space, and its from msdn.microsoft.com. It gives me an error saying i didn't specify a main method.
Shouldn't it be public shared sub main () then?
you can pass a reference to the textbox itself. instead of using `form2.show()`, make your own method that takes the textbox reference and saves it in a form level variable (`dim destText as Textbox`), then use that to populate the value on send. I believe objects are done by reference by default.
thank you
thank you
this works better if you narrow it to the minimum of code to show the problem and post it here using the code markup. also describe what "no working" means, exactly. very very very few people are doing download a bunch of files off google drive and try to run it, if they even have such a system at-hand. 
ubound() -1 not =1. 
that's not fixed...
How did you define counter1?
I don't see any comment in this thread that says that. Anyways, that should start fixing your problem.
Hey man, as some other people in this thread have already said, you need to change the UBound(names) = 1 to UBound(names) -1 for both counter 1 and counter 2, then that will fix the error. &gt; For counter1 = 0 To UBound(names) = 1 doesn't evaluate because you can't set the UBound of an array like that, and the for loop is interpreting it wrong, change it to - 1 for both counters and it'll work
If this is a simple thing for excel and you don't want to learn how to program extensively (there's quite a bit to learning VB), I'd go against what everyone would say (including myself) and go look into VBA Visual Basic for Applications. It's not as full on as vb .net but it'll do the job. If you did want to go full .net, google 'vb.net excel interop' for the libraries, then search the library on github and select VB for example projects.
Do you have a specific question?
I support what what /u/Jesuschrist2011 is saying. Start with VBA, your comfortable will Excel and VBA will do most of what you need I expect.
If it were an equals sign, the line: &gt;For counter1 = 0 To UBound(names) = 1 Cannout evaluate into anything, as you are trying to count from counter1 to the upperbound of names() whilst simultaneously setting it to 1 (which you cannot do). It has to be a minus sign as you want to count to the upper bound of names minus one, as arrays are zero based. That is, if an array has 5 items then the highest index is 4, because there are items in names(0),names(1),names(2),names(3) and names(4). Whilst this is 5 items, and Ubound() will return 5, there is no names(5), so you're telling it to count to Ubound(names) - 1 to circumvent this. If you wrote the code you must understand why you're putting - 1 at the end, and why it can't be = 1. I downloaded your code to Visual Studio 2013 and got the error, changed to - 1 and the error wasn't there anymore. So it's got to read: &gt; For counter1 = 0 To UBound(names) - 1 
What happens to "position" while you're reading your file?
I would recommend reading the file in line by line and then splitting the two values on the comma instead of doing it in the read function. http://www.vb6.us/tutorials/how-read-simple-text-files http://www.vb6.us/tutorials/vb-string-array-functions-split-join-filter 
Instead of students(pointer) in the textbox, use NameM.
Position isn't incrementing so each iteration is overwriting the array at index 1. In the original do loop, add position = position + 1 Edit: also, what version are you using? From .net, there are far easier ways to accomplish this. And if you're in .net 3.5 or greater, LINQ could handle this in about 4 lines of code.
In the "button_click" event, you can do it the long way: If Label1.Visible = True Then ' or If Label1.Visible Then Label1.Visible = False Else Label1.Visible = True End If Or the short way: Label1.Visible = Not Label.Visible 
Check [this link](http://www.vbdotnetforums.com/ide/61759-visual-studio-2015-released-visual-basic-14-net-4-6-a.html), it might help.
http://imgur.com/xvlglSd this is a picture of the form i am working with... please help :(
Ahhh, I see what I did wrong. I forgot I had to declare new values inside the function because the scope of those values is only within the function. Then you pass through the scrollbar_tempF.value &amp; scrollbar_windspeed.value when you call the function. Thanks guys! &amp;nbsp; But now I have another problem.. The function is giving me incorrect values for the windchill. I don't think 45mph winds and a temp of -15F will give me a warm windchill of 50 degrees F. I'll spend the day trying to figure out what's causing it to do that. I'll get back to you guys if I can't get it within 24hrs. &amp;nbsp; /u/shodanx &amp;nbsp; /u/hdsrob &amp;nbsp; /u/DarkPulseModz
You are an absolute life saver, thank you so much!
RadioButtons have an "AutoCheck" property that you can set to false. Once you do that, you can manage their checked property yourself from the code, usually in the "click" events. Using that technique, you can make buttons that can be checked, but not unchecked.
This is fun to do with LINQ: Sub Main Dim s = "123456789" Dim Parity = Function(str As String, bit As Integer) str.Where(Function(x) Val(x) Mod 2 = bit).Aggregate("", Function(x, y) String.Concat(x, y)) Dim evens = Parity(s, 0) Dim odds = Parity(s, 1) Debug.Print("Evens: " &amp; evens &amp; ", Odds: " &amp; odds) End Sub 
Your statements are running into each other, use line breaks or more colons. Your do loops would be cleaner as for loops, but would appear to be OK.
You can't refresh just a single element, that is the job of the page itself to do. You can check periodically via a timer or other sort of delayed loop to see if a given elements value has changed, but I don't know how you would refresh just a single element from a page. That operation would require a full or partial postback to the webserver assuming the changed value comes from the server side. At the very least it would be javascript based if all the potential values are loaded once and changed client side.
Just run it and time how long it takes... PHP has some provision to time code execution I'm guessing...?
This file has that built in.
It depends on the number, and what numbers it already knows.
Oh my goodness.. what was I thinking. It was a late night last night I apologize. I know how websites work, I should have known better. A thought though is that I could possibly download the page and hold it into a temp directory as the base image. Then reload the page and download it, compare that element id and look for changes. If changes are present, stop refreshing and alert the user. When the user wants to start refreshing again, click the refresher button. But still not sure how I'd go about that lol.
You can put it in an update panel...
an update panel? excuse my ignorance, it's been a good long while 
Again, depends on your hardware. With the computer I test it on, probably, 20 hours.* *Assuming you know no primes at all.
Give me your teacher's email address and I'll just turn your homework in for you. 
That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
So if I understand: |----------- = 100% left player, 0% right player ------|----- = 100% left player, 100% right player -----------| = 0% left player, 100% right player What's the issue? Working out the volumes, or controlling the volume of the media player control?
so, if you put a break point in your sub example() are you getting any value in your variable movie_ID? I am not super familiar with VB6 but from my experience with VB and SQL queries, your SQL query that is sent as a string, does not have access to the variable movie_ID. Either using string.format to add the value of this variable to use a parameterized query to insert your variable. this should then return the record with the approprate m_ID. edit: so you are asking the database to return records where the m_ID column has the literal value "movie_ID", not a number as you are intending.
correct. code in question: "Select * From Movie_Details Where M_ID=movieID" you have to use string concatenation to make the SQL string what you literally want it to be. "Select * From Movie_Details Where M_ID=" &amp; movieID 
Just an FYI, I moderate vbforums.com, and only brand new users have to get posts approved. Once you post a few times that will go away. This is to prevent bots and spam from littering the forums.

Thanks man!!Though i solved it with a friends help i really appreciate you taking your time to help me.
I am studying in university of Pune.Its fuck-all!! Even i dont know why are they teaching such old stuff.I am in my final year of graduation
I think it should work, if you name the images/resource names sequentially. Refer to answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8767755/how-do-you-load-an-image-from-resource-file-in-vb-2010-expresss
Got it! I used &gt; lbl_celsius.Text = CStr(CInt(((CDbl(lbl_calced_windchill_F.Text) - &gt; 32) * (5 / 9)))) to get it to round up. If there's an easier way please let me know.
Use `Math.Round`/`Floor`/`Ceil` for all your rounding needs. Converting to an integer type also works if you only want to truncate fractions. Just be aware that `Math.Round` uses banker's rounding by default. 
Assuming you already have the proper apis for changing the volume of an application, you could "id" each player by it's process id. If you know id 1 is left and id 2 is right, then you could crossfade like so public sub fade(left,right) for i as int32 = 0 to 101 step 1 left.volume = 100 - i right.volume = 0 + i next end sub or something like that. Edit: I should explain: the "i" is a value that ranges from 0 -&gt; 100 over time. Since left needs to go down, we can take it's starting volume (100) and subtract where we are in the fade (i), and with the right we can do the inverse.
Additionally, you could do left.volume -= 1 and right.volume += 1, but I figured this would be easier to visualize.
why wouldn't you save it as 1: texas, Item 2: washington ? it's also unclear what you're having trouble with
alright did not know. Thanks for the heads up
I'm on my phone right now. But try something like this. currentValue = currentValue + transactionValue Even if the transactionValue is negative. It should subtract from the currentValue.
My bad, I will update this post when I get home. Thank you
I'm guessing you need to check the dialog result to see if the user selected ok or cancel before you set your string to the value of the dialogbox's filename field.
Have you tried just terminating the process rdpclip.exe on your client as well as the terminal server then restarting it? That usually fixes my problems with pasting between remote sessions.
Yes, try to declare it outside of the sub. 
Thank you very very much. I was confused about this line all the time, but now it works perfect. The last Problem is, that i seperate the fields of the array with semikolons in the textfile and it ends the textfile with a single semikolon on the end. If the program reads the textfile and saves it again, it adds more single semikolons everytime. How can i remove the last semikolon in my textfile? My code to save the array is: Public Sub WriteFile() If System.IO.File.Exists("C:\PostIt\PostIt.txt") = True Then 'Wenn die Datei existiert System.IO.File.Delete("C:\PostIt\PostIt.txt") 'Datei löschen, damit alter Inhalt nicht doppelt in existente Datei geschrieben wird End If 'If Abfrage beenden If System.IO.File.Exists("C:\PostIt\PostIt.txt") = False Then 'Wenn die Datei nicht existiert System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory("C:\PostIt\") 'Verzeichnis erstellen Dim creator As System.IO.StreamWriter = IO.File.CreateText("PostIt.txt") 'Datei erstellen creator.Close() 'Dateizugriff beenden End If 'If Abfrage beenden Using Writer As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter("c:\PostIt\PostIt.txt", True) 'Datei öffnen For i = 0 To arrText.Length - 1 'Zähler "i" erstellen von 0 bis zum Ende des Arrays "arrText" Writer.WriteLine(arrText(i) + ";") 'Text aus Array "arrText" in die Datei schreiben. Spalten des Arrays in der Datei durch ";" trennen Next i 'Schleife fortführen Writer.Close() 'Dateizugriff beenden End Using 'Benutzung von "StreamWriter" beenden End Sub 
Here you go this should work 'Set the Filter. OpenFileDialog1.Filter = "Bitmap |*.bmp| JPG | *.jpg | GIF | *.gif | All Files|*.*" 'Clear the file name OpenFileDialog1.FileName = "" 'Show it If OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog(Me) = DialogResult.OK Then 'Get the image name string img = OpenFileDialog1.FileName 'Create a new Bitmap and display it PictureBox1.Image = System.Drawing.Bitmap.FromFile(img) End If 
Excellent, it worked perfectly after the changes! Thanks for your help. This is probably a stupid question, but how do I just post code?, do I just copy the code and paste it into the text box?
Thanks a lot. This is more difficult than I thought it would be.
So far that is what I've coded. I've just set the form up and declared the variables. That's all. I'm not too sure where to go from here.
Here is what I've coded so far: Public Class frmPhone Private Sub btnOne_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnOne.Click txtScreen.Text = "1" Dim one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero As Double one = "1" two = "2" three = "3" four = "4" five = "5" six = "6" seven = "7" eight = "8" nine = "9" zero = "0" **Don't know where to go from here** End Sub
There is also the TextBox.AppendText(...) method. It also auto-scrolls to the end of multi-line textboxes if there is enough text...
You'll want to look into the asc() and chr() commands for turning a character into it's ASCII code and back again
Hey! I had this problem using a VDI. I wrote a vb application that will paste whatever is on your PC clipboard by emulating the keypresses with sendkeys. Would this be what you need? I reckon you could adapt it to give a dropdown list. Which computer would it run on, the host PC?
 Math.Round(value, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) The ".AwayFromZero" part has VB use "normal" rounding (.5 goes to next number) instead of banker's rounding (.5 rounds to nearest even number).
Since this is clearly homework, what do you have so far? People around here like to help, but not do people's assignments for them.
How would I implement this? I'm sorry if its obvious but as I said I'm really new to all this!
A bit like this: Sub Main Dim max As Integer = 32 ' Pick a number between 1 and max Dim half As Integer = max \ 2 Dim guess As Integer = half Do Dim userSays = InputBox("Is your number (H)igher, (L)ower or (E)qual to " &amp; guess &amp; "?") Select Case userSays.ToUpper Case "H" half = half \ 2 guess = guess + Math.Max(half, 1) ' 1 \ 2 is zero, we don't want that. Case "L" half = half \ 2 guess = guess - Math.Max(half, 1) Case "E", "=" MsgBox("I knew I'd find it!") : Exit Do Case Else MsgBox("Huh?") End Select Loop End Sub 
What platform are you targeting? Is this WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET, Modern UI? Lets say you are using WinForms because that is typically still where most people start out, the easiest thing would be for you to add a picturebox to the form and set the picture you want to appear in it, and set its visible property to false. You can then via code set its visible property to true when you want it to be visible. You can also dynamically load images into the picturebox (for example if you wanted to swap one image for another) using pictureboxname.image = image.fromfile(pathtofile)
exporting is meant for importing into another vba. vba and vb.net are very very different. even copying code you're going to do a LOT of rewriting. you're almost starting from scratch, in fact i recommend you do. task approach in .net is different than in vba, so direct porting is going to have odd work arounds and really weird code.
Damn. I've been working on this project for around a year and was kind of expecting (but praying against) that answer. I need the code to manipulate an excel document. What do I need to do, other than add Excel as a reference, to get this all working properly?
is `.Cells(Arg2, "A")` the correct place to pull the name from?
the names are in column A and have the exact same range as the x and y values. that's why I'm mystified by the names not aligning with correct pay grades and compensation value. 
Look at visual Studio tools for office (vsto) . But, I agree, you need to do this from scratch. 
That's cool, I didn't know about the stopwatch class. Thanks!
Hi All, I'm a beginner of VB, currently i would like to write a program which have below requirement: -Find all Combination of words in different group EX: **Group A:** Apple Melon Lemon **Group B**: Sam Ashely Kayle Result should be like this: 1. Apple Sam 2. Apple Ashely 3. Apple Kayle 4. Melon Sam 5. Melon Ashely 6. etc hope you guys can help me out. Appreciate your help. Thanks!
You and OP have the same homework?
i guess he's just helped me to re-organize my question
Fantastic question. Post what you've tried so far and we'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction! :)
You'll want to look at database management and interfaces. Easiest way to do it will probably be in Access or MySQL, with minimal VB input. 
It needs to be in the same folder as the exe file if you wanted to specify it with no path like picturebox1.image = image.fromfile("mypicture.png") Or you can specify a full path picturebox1.image = image.fromfile("c:\somedirectory\mypicture.png")
I would pick SQL Express over either of those 2 databases. When it comes to VB.NET SQL Express is going to have the easiest integration, especially using an ORM like entity framework.
format(OPsWork)
you'd need to edit the sql statement or stored query that selects the users.
So something like: Dim sel As String = "SELECT First_Name,Last_Name,User_Name,Current_Employee FROM Users ORDER BY User_Name" then what?
"WHERE current_employee=True" after the FROM and before the ORDER BY
I did it like this: Dim sel As String = "SELECT First_Name,Last_Name,User_Name,Current_Employee FROM Users WHERE Curent_Employee=True ORDER BY User_Name" It killed the drop down box. What now? By the way, I'm very thankful for the help.
lol of course... derp.
so what's the problem? there's several well documented ways to do that you also need to say what version you're using.
Not really thought it out but couldn't you just use nested for loops? Pseudocode: For each wordA as String in Group A For each wordB as String in Group B Console.Writeline(wordA &amp; wordB) Next Next
I am using Visual Studio Community 2015, since I am a begginner at Visual Basic i would like some help
your first goal might be to figure out how to do the storage, maybe via a database (sql express is popular). then "linking" the boxes may before more clear.
Thanks man its working.But now it can only display the label caption and does not display the images.Screenshots:http://imgur.com/a/hICkf
solved it.Used * in select Statement.Thanks a lot man!!!!!!!
In your select, you list 2 fields, so you cannot ask for ".Fields(7)" It's generally better to ask for the fields by name, so that if you later change the number of fields or their order, you don't break all your code. In this case, try using rs.Fields("Poster") to get your info. 
No problem. Although I still prefer the "refer to fields by name" solution... :) 
Timer1 calls Timer1_Tick; I don't see anything that's going to call your Timer1_Timer() sub... 
Depending on where your Xof and iter variables are declared, Form11 might not have access to them. By default, VB will automatically create empty variables (and compile) but crash at runtime. Every module and form of your application should have "Option Explicit" as the first line. That will prevent VB from creating missing variables for you and let you know where there is a variable access problem. 
i have made both of them global
Have you tried putting a breakpoint on that line and examining the content of Xor and the value of iter at that point? You were doing iter = iter + 1 in the other form, maybe iter is still larger than your last array item?
If you use control arrays, the event handler will give you the index of the clicked control and you can use that to determine which one has been clicked. Right now, once iter=10, it stays at 10 for the rest of the program. Other solution: when setting your images, put the value of iter in the ".Tag" property of the control and get it back from there when the control is clicked.
form global or project global in a module? I'd not do either. since you only need the movie name value for the Form11 you should pass it in. don't call example() from the Form11 form_load and instead make example() Public, add a parameter to it, and call it from the sub that opens form11 passing in the movie name. globals will get you into trouble. pass values around when you can. 
is there a simpler solution ? since i'm kind of a n00b at VBasic from what I was able to research it looked far too complex to do.
you're not going to find some point and click way.
What does your code look like?
i just changed the code as follows:http://imgur.com/uqcXRxp it works properly now.Thanks!!
i have one more problem.What should be the query for filtering the movies displayed according to its price?My database has a field called Price. i tried but i get an error. Screenshots:http://imgur.com/a/bG3yf
Use the code below, (sorry for the other post) Dim isColorRed As Boolean = False Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Timer1.Interval = 1000 Timer1.Start() End Sub Private Sub Timer1_Tick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick Label1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString Target = TimeValue("22:49:00") If DateTime.Now &gt;= Target Then Timer1_Timer() End If End Sub Private Sub Timer1_Timer() If isColorRed Then Label2.ForeColor = Color.Red isColorRed = False Else Label2.ForeColor = Color.White isColorRed = True End If End Sub
"Data Type Mismatch" occurs when you try to compare different data types. How is "Price" defined in your database? What type of field is it?
keyword: control arrays. you can create one as index zero (you have to have one on the form) then use the "Load" keyword to make copies of it and .Move() them to where they need to be on the form. or you can just create the max you want on the page and hide the ones you aren't using.
I'd probably use a listview control instead of checkboxes on the cart form.
Could you use the IsNumeric function? Then use an If Else statement and/or MsgBox to display an error if there are alphabetical errors.
http://imgur.com/dIPx2Bl
You could do something like this: Public Function GetPosition(value as Integer) As Integer Dim position = 1 If ProgressBar1.Value &gt; value Then position +=1 If ProgressBar2.Value &gt; value Then position +=1 ' etc. Return position End Function Label1.Text = GetPosition(ProgressBar1.Value) Label2.Text = GetPosition(ProgressBar2.Value) ' etc. You could even loop through all progress bars on the form for an arbitrary number of progress bars: Function GetPosition(value as Integer) As Integer Dim position = 1 For Each progressBar In Controls.OfType(Of ProgressBar) If ProgressBar.Value &gt; value Then position += 1 Next Return position End Function
Thanks for the reply, I managed to solve my issue!
please can you giev me the syntax?
Have you tried anything yet? That's about as basic as it can get beyond hello world. Break it down into steps, first write a program that takes exactly 3 integers and then ends. This will teach you basic Input Output, and type checking. (What if someone puts in a letter instead of one of the numbers?) For the math portion, "multiple of 3" means that the result should have a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. Look into the Modulus operator and it should be obvious. In the future, please try the assignment for awhile first and only then look for help on the specific pieces you do not understand. Providing details on what you did try and why! If you don't really learn the basics like this exercise teaches you, your issues are going to continue to compound and get worse.
Yes in vb6. You can add controls to the toolbox. There are a bunch of standard controls like the date time picker and listview. You can even manipulate the listview quite a bit. Just right click on the toolbox, choose components, and add the microsoft windows common controls. There is even a Microsoft Flexgrid control which you can use, which might be better. I usually use a different 3rd party grid control but I've used the microsoft one before too.
Dont know if there was any chance anyone was going to answer, but I'm all set. I went with the first option and it worked great, it perfectly mimics carrier breakouts made by hand. 
[MSDN is always a good place to start](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/xzwf0t6d(v=vs.100\).aspx) 
To specifically answer your question about the forms. The answer is no. You can not import or copy VBA forms in to VB.net. They must all be rebuilt from scratch. That being said you can technically import or copy paste procedures/methods into vb.net but as others have said it is messy. 
Take a look at MessageBox.Show.
Ah, thank you my friend.
Yes, that will work. Except that your example does "character =" and then checks "word", but with the variable names sorted out, it will be ok. Answer to 1: You get the index of the first character (index is zero-based) Answer to 2: You get -1, the program doesn't crash. 
Thank you for your help :) 
I'm pretty sure that's just a designer thing, and that won't appear once you actually run your program.
You could get each character by looping while indexOf != 1 and removing the last found char
Looks nice. The linked project is a console app that looks nothing like that, though...
Won't you have people overwriting other people's changes? Also, what happens if you load while someone's editing the textboxes? Do all their changes get written over? 
I declared &lt;code&gt; Dim outFile As StreamWriter &lt;/code&gt; in the Public Class frmMain
1. The line highlighted in your screenshot where you encountered the exception of for `inFile`, not `outFile` 2. After you declare it, you still have to *set* it: `Dim outFile As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter`... otherwise it's just an empty variable, no? (I'm not entirely certain about this without the IDE in front of me, but I assume it's like other similar objects that you still need to create a new instance for it.) 
Someone wrote a [.Net wrapper](https://libspotifydotnet.codeplex.com/) for libSpotify, so assuming that wrapper works ok, you can use any .Net language to access it. 
No. There are no "pure OOP" languages and you wouldn't want to use it if it were.
I thought smalltalk was pure oop
Event driven and OO aren't mutual or exclusive. It's actually both. 
make a function that checks to see if everything is answered (the "requirements") and enables the button. then in the click and/or change events of everything call that function.
You could say that. I prefer to say that it has syntax that makes writing OOP style code easier, as you don't have to write in an OOP fashion.
I say this because I can do my_Int_var.count() which count is the method on the into variable type/object.
In a nutshell what is polymorphism?
I would understand better if I were looking at example code or something.
I did something similar by using if statements to add 1 or subtract 1 from a counter. The counter would reset after every "final" button push. If the final button were pressed early the user was prompted with a message box saying that something wasn't filled in correctly. I think the count had to equal an exact number or else the final button couldn't be pressed. I did this a long time ago and I can't share the exact code. Good luck 
Can you post what you have done so far?
There's a simple explanation in the link above, but really it's about being able to override methods when inheriting from base classes. This allows you to create a class that inherits from a base, and then redesign the original subs or functions to better suite the new class. 
Encapsulation is really the core concept behind classes / objects. It's about creating individual objects that encapsulate many variables (a person class for instance), and being able to manipulate that object as a single item. Inheritance is basing classes on other classes, so that you don't have to write the same properties or functions multiple times. So a "Person" might be the base class (with Name, Address, etc for properties), and then you could create classes that inherit from Person like Customer and Employee. They would automatically inherit the Name, Address, and other existing properties from Person, and then you can add more specific properties like Pay Rate or Job for Employee, or Shipping Address or Billing Information for Customer. 
&gt; the property that contains the condition this does not exist. you have to code it. you must define what it means for a question to be unanswered and then code a condition for it. for example, `if txtQ1.text = "" then` means unanswered. 
 Private Sub frmMain_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim inFile As StreamReader inFile = File.OpenText("grades.csv") Dim data, f, l As String Dim first(16), last(16), hw1(16), hw2(16), project(16), mid(16), final(16) As String Do While (inFile.Peek &lt;&gt; -1) data = inFile.ReadLine first = data.Split(CChar(", ")) For i As Integer = 0 To first.Length - 1 first(i) = first(0) lstNames.Items.Add(first(i)) i = i + 1 Next textlabel.Text = first(1) Loop inFile.Close() End Sub I have to read the inputted data into different arrays. FOr an example , Randy,Johnson,100,95,80,87,89, I have to read the first name into one array, last name into another array, and each grade into another
SelectedItem is for a list, not a text, and will be the list index, not the text.
I see. Thanks a lot.
Une appli VB5 (donc 32 bits) devrait tourner sous Win64, mais il faut que msvbvm50.dll soit placé dans \Windows\SysWOW64 (ainsi que les .ocx accompagnant, s'il y en a). Les .ocx doivent également être enregistré à cet emplacement avec l'utilitaire Regsvr32.exe Sinon, comme .Net ne supporte plus de façon directe les "control arrays", il faut les définir manuellement. Un exemple simple: Public Class Form1 Dim Images(0 To 1) As PictureBox Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Images(0) = New PictureBox() Images(0).Location = New Point(10, 10) Images(0).Size = New Size(100, 100) Images(0).BackColor = Color.Blue Images(0).Visible = True Images(1) = New PictureBox() Images(1).Location = New Point(20, 20) Images(1).Size = New Size(100, 100) Images(1).BackColor = Color.Red Images(1).Visible = True Me.Controls.Add(Images(0)) Me.Controls.Add(Images(1)) End Sub End Class
.Text may work for a list, but not for all controls. .SelectedItem on a text box should raise an error.
I used nested if statements to have various requirements. Though if you have a bunch there might be a better way Private Sub SCRCreate_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles SCRCreate.Click If GlobalSR.Text = "" Then Me.GlobalSR.BackColor = Color.Red Else If SCRIssueVerified.Checked = False Then MessageBox.Show("Please verify that the issue exists before creating the SCR.") Me.SCRIssueVerified.BackColor = Color.Red Else If SCRIssueVerified.Checked = False Then MessageBox.Show("Please verify issue and gather screen shots prior to creating Colaboration.") Me.SCRWebex.BackColor = Color.Red Else Me.GlobalSR.BackColor = Color.White Me.SCRIssueVerified.BackColor = Color.Transparent Me.SCRWebex.BackColor = Color.Transparent Me.SCRK2advisor.BackColor = Color.Transparent After the last else is the full process for what i was doing. Make sure if you do something like change a button to be red, that you change it back after all requirements are met.
&gt; If (major = "Business") Or (major = "Computer Science") Then 
Thank you.
That's interesting. A little confusing to me, but I get the idea that if you try to click the button before all requirements are met then it turns red and it'll turn back once all requirements are met.
if you have COM1 open in Hercules then you can't also open it in your app. serial ports can only be used by one app at a time.

What error are you getting? A common mistake would be either misnaming the text box or not setting it as .Text
I see. I think there's another way I'm going to do it, though. But I'll keep this as a backup.
Iif
what about iif?
are you trying to emulate a serial device? you'd need a virtual serial port of some sort, I'm not sure if that's possible with VB. maybe there's some 3rd party software that you can use. or just get an andruino clone Pro Micro off ebay for $5 or so and put your code to emulate there, it'll show as a usb-serial device on your PC. 
I see :)
I see. Thanks for clearing this up for me. :)
I see. Thanks for clearing this up for me. :)

IIF() is different than IF(). IF() is short circuiting, which means that it only evaluates and returns the true or false result. Inline If IIF() is not short circuiting, which means it evaluates both the true and false result, and returns whichever one it should. Scenarios where this may be important would be where the true and false results are actually function calls that could alter state of objects. If you need more clarification, let me know.
The compiled DLLs that work, can you find out what version of Visual Studio they were compiled with? If the source code you have is identical to the working DLLs, then there is some sort of settings/version mismatch somewhere. Unfortunately, StackOverflowException is a tough thing to troubleshoot without walking the source code. I would venture to guess though, that the working DLLs you were sent, and the source code are not exactly the same and there was maybe some modification to the source code or at least the project settings itself since the original DLLs were compiled.
I am, I got it mostly working at this point! :) I'm trying to figure out how to randomize some numbers though. Still searching around for that information. Thank you for your help.
I usually create a class that has all of my JSON attributes as properties. Then deserialize the JSON into your class. Then it is a simple matter of replacing the "3" in your download string with the appropriate property from your JSON class.
 Looked like a small typo. You had an = instead of a &amp; for your last concatenation. Try: LabelLight.Text = "turn the light on " &amp; EnterTextBox.Text &amp; "." Or... Use String format. LabelLight.Text = String.Format("turn the light on {0}.", EnterTextBox.Text)
&gt;Or... Use String format. &gt; LabelLight.Text = String.Format("turn the light on {0}.", EnterTextBox.Text) Also, with Visual Basic 14, they can also do: LabelLight.Text = $"turn the light on {EnterTextBox.Text}." It's definitely one of my most-used of the new language features in VB14 (followed closely by the `?.` operator).
Interesting. Tough to Google on mobile, but I need to start using that. 
You are amazing! A classmate and I were able to come up with the "kill numbers" but we struggled to get any further than that. We started digging into multiples and found that if: (sticks in pile-1) Mod 6 = 0 then the user should start. We might be over complicating it a little, so thank you!
That is exactly what VB suggested I do, I just do not understand why it will not consider both of the variables as integer. The only reason i did not keep it that way was because the calculations were coming out VERY wrong when i did that.
This worked!!! However the calculation itself is now giving me wierd numbers. Do you see anything in my code that would indicate a calculation error? Test data says that 200 in the calories text box and 8 in the fat grams textbox should display 36% as the total. It is showing up as 0.00% :(
This question can really only be answered with a book. Database programming is amazing and powerful but there is so much stuff going on it can't really be answered with a few lines of code. I learned from an older version of this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672323435?keywords=vb%20access&amp;qid=1444882726&amp;ref_=sr_1_9&amp;sr=8-9
Thank you for your well thought out response. I fully understand what you said, which makes it even more strange that changing the variable to double didn't do actually do anything. I don't want to bother you because you already spent alot of time helping me but can you see any obvious problems here?
what version?
See, it doesn't have to be anything special. Not worried about encryption. It's not going to be used real world. Just as a final for my second year of college lol. We got to develop our own business application, so this is what I chose. Perhaps a bit above my head, but nevertheless, I'll learn a lot during it but time is counting down. I do have a userID in the tblCredentials in access. I also have a tblExpenses and a tblIncome. I need to be able to log in and add money to the income then in expenses select a category for an expense add the amount and then the application subtract the numbers and display what's left if anything. that's why I need some how to keep the data only for whom is logged in. Does that make sense by chance? 
are you sure it's on that line? what's the whole error? 800a03f6 is usually that you have something unclosed but reported line is at the end of the file so it can be anywhere
 Dim Output As String = "*******" For i As Integer = 0 To 6 Console.WriteLine(Output.Substring(0, 7 - i)) Next
I am sure it is an option in visual studio. Not sure exactly but looking through your settings, you should be able to find if. 
You could use a counter. If the check box is checked then take the value of check box and add it to the counter and so on... If it isn't do nothing. The coding is for you to do. 
Output.Substring(i) works too.
LINQ one-liner: Console.Write(Join(Enumerable.Range(0, 7).Select(Function(x) "*******".Substring(x)).ToArray, vbCrLf))
This feels like a homework problem. Please post your code so we can see what you've tried already
Go up to the Build menu and Clean the solution. See if that works.
On this problem in particular i havent got anything, i'm not sure where to start, i can post the code i used for the other loop i did that counts the loop number if that helps.
It's difficult to give much advice without knowing your current knowledge level. Here's a couple of pointers to get you sent off in the right direction though: * You can use the "mod" function to check if a number is even. This will work for negative numbers as well as positive numbers. Zero will appear to be an "even" number if you don't make any special exceptions for it. * You can use a FOR loop to go through the series of numbers. Check if each one is even or not and then perform the required calculations to each number. After your loop has completed you should be able to do the remaining calculations.
I am also new to Visual Basic, but for the first thing you need to do the only thing I could think of is to change the variable data types to decimal instead of double. Sorry if it doesn't work.
I'm struggeling to get the code anyhow...so the knowledge level is quite basic. :) So currently no code to share. Hope that maybe someone could share some examples of such calculations in VB, so I could go further. Tried the mod to find even/odd numbers, but do not know how to put the square calculations in and how to put those two working together.
1: You're converting the entered numbers to integers with `CInt` before you assign them to your `Double` fields, and integers cannot store fractions. 2: You can call methods on expressions. E.g. `(sum + meals).ToString("C")` 3: You should use `Decimal` instead of `Double` for money.
Thank you! Now all i need to figure how to do is to set my focus back to the first prompt when i hit the clear button. right now when i hit clear itll clear the inputs and then clear the listbox but my focus is still on the blank listbox
While the loop is running the main thread is blocked, so `Timer1_Tick` doesn't get a chance to run. This is a very weird way of doing things. Just set the timer interval to the total duration you want to wait, remove the loop, and move the `do some things` into `Timer1_Tick` instead.
It's definitely a possibility. Haha
To return the focus all you need to do is under your code to clear the textboxes type the name of the text box which you wanna change focus to and. Focus(). For an example textbox1.focus()
* ID of the checkbox ** ID of the movie Sry, autocorrect. And I am not able to edit my comment on Reddit in Motion.
Did you try to code anything? At all? 
docs on SQLDataSet seem really really lite, but what I'm gathering is that the "tables" are basically virtual, they refer to the resultsets your SQL returns. if your SQL is a stored proc it's possible to have multiple resultsets, and the Tables object is one way to access them. if your results are empty you will still have tables, they just will have no rows. the only way have Tables.count = 0 is to use a non-result query, such as an insert or update or some system command.
hey sorry using vb 2013
I dont really understand what I need to put. Sorry if this is a trivial thing, I'm really new to this.
Do you have to use Do loops? If so, try this. 1. Separate both of your Do loops. Nesting Do Loops can be tricky. You also need While conditions for these loops otherwise the run forever. 2. Declare your storage array before you enter the first loop. (There is some stuff missing here for you to figure out.) Dim fruitarray(9) As String Do While fruitarray(9) = "" Dim fruittype As String = Nothing fruittype = InputBox("Add type of fruit", , , , ) fruitarray(i) = (fruittype) Loop 3. Now do the second Do Loop. Once again there is some stuff missing here. Do While ListBox1.Items.Count &lt; 10 Loop

This is a very confusing assignment. How are you supposed to get the strings to put in the array if they do not already exist? The second half, the output makes more sense to me but the input loop is confusing. The output would be easier using the [foreach loop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ebk1751(v=vs.120).aspx) For Each fruit as string in fruitArray(9) listbox.items.add(fruit) next 
I think it's important for you to understand what it's currently doing, so the first thing you should do is to change the lblRep.Text assignment to an appending and run the program again: lblRep.Text &amp;= CStr(somme) &amp; " " This will show you what the value of somme is on every iteration of the loop, which should show you what exactly it's doing and why it's not giving you the expected results. On a side note, &amp; is the operator for string concatenation. The VB.Net documentation says it's safer than using + to concatenate strings. Personally I've never seen (or even heard of) any problems resulting from using + to concatenate, but whatever. Anyway, the solution to the looping problem is to have the iteration variable be different from your somme variable. The loop itself is adding 1 to the iteration variable every pass, then you're adding 1 to it within the loop, so you're only looping 3 times (in the case where 5 is input). You want an iteration variable that's only incremented by the loop itself, not by other code within the loop. For i As Integer = 1 To nombre somme += i Next lblRep.Text = "La somme des nombres vaut: " &amp; somme.ToString Notice I also moved the lblRep.Text assignment outside the loop. Since you're just assigning the final value (as opposed to appending every increment), there's no need to have this inside the loop; it's an extra, unnecessary operation occurring on every iteration. You'd probably have to have a loop that iterated millions or billions of times for this to even have a noticeable effect on the program's performance, but it's never too early to start thinking about efficiency. The more you train yourself to spot minor efficiency issues like this, the easier it is to identify larger efficiency issues later on.
Yeah, CStr will work fine. 
True. I misread that. 
look at math.ceiling In my case I started with an integer X . Converted to double D. Divide D by 10. Use Math.Ceiling on (D+5). Multiply D by 10 and return Integer
It's working, I'm trying to figure out the logic behind it now. Thanks a lot!
Sorry for not responding guys, my internet has been a bit iffy latley. So this is what i had attempted when iposted the comment. Dim seq As String = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{" Dim length As Integer Dim x As Integer Dim a As Char = Mid(seq, 1, 1) x = 1 length = Len(seq) Console.WriteLine(a) For y = 1 To 13 For x = 2 To (y + 2) Console.WriteLine(Mid(seq, (x), 1)) Next Next Console.ReadKey()
I think you are trying to put text into an integer variable X=Val(text). Will set variable x to be the numeric value of the text And. Int(x) will convert the variable to an integer
 ((value + 9) \ 10) * 10
Neat. I did something similar in highscool with VB3 (no wiki links though - it didn't exist)
Apologies for my deleted post. It has been a busy day for me and I was being stupid. :S 
Thanks, I could really use some suggestions if you have any, I'm running low on ideas. The problem I'm having is that the ideas I have are way too clunky for such a lightweight program.
That's so elegant and I've never thought of that. The sheer simplicity is beautiful. 
 Dim num1 as Integer Dim num2 as Integer Dim num3 as Integer Dim num4 as Integer Dim total as Integer if (Int.TryParse(txt1.text, out num1) And Int.TryParse(txt2.text, out num2) And Int.TryParse(txt3.text, out num3) And Int.TryParse(txt3.text, out num4)) Then total = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 txtTotal.text = total.toString() Else MessageBox.Show("error message", "Title") End If
im not too worried about user input for this, im basically making a stand-alone excel spreadsheet with a little bit of other stuff. and my code works as intended right now. i originally put everything into variables but felt it was too ugly to look at so i started changing it. if thats a bad way to do it ill change it back though. i was mostly just wondering why my code required to remove the "Val(" from the code to get it to work
you can definitely have val() around textbox2.text if you want, so that is not the cause of your error. If I used this code: TextBoxtotal.Text = FormatNumber(Val(-TextBox1.Text) + Val(TextBox2.Text) - Val(TextBox3.Text) - Val(TextBox4.Text), 2) it works just fine. Again, you have that - in front of textbox1.text, so it is converting that to a negative number. If your 4 textboxes had 10 10 5 5 you might expect 10+10-5-5=10, but it will actually be -10+10-5-5 so you will get -10 as an answer.
well its definitely not working properly for me and the only thing im changing is TextBox2.Text to Val(TextBox2.Text) (with the former being correct) I'm taking just values from a textbox so I don't think other code is messing with it somewhere else. (That's one of the reasons why I wanted to do it this way) but if its poor practice to do it this way I will change it back to the way I originally had it which was putting everything into variables(even though i think it looks ugly that way). also, when i turned option strict on it didnt give me any compile errors
If you turned on Option Strict, this would definitely give you an error -TextBox1.Text In any event, just my opinion, but you should structure the code similar to the original code I posted. It prevents any chance for exceptions to occur when the code runs.
do you have option strict on at the top of your code? If you turn option strict on in visual studio, it only will apply to new projects you create, otherwise the project you already made will still operate with option strict off. you can change that in the project properties of the specific project under the compile tab. Also you can set option strict on/off at the code file level by putting it all the way at the top above any other code: Option Strict On Public Class Form1 .... End Class 
What language? It really shouldn't be too difficult. Most languages have a getDateTime function of some sort, and from there you can add or subtract hours based on GMT 
Yes, but where in the book does it assign a value to that decimal. Here is your code with comments. Dim decTotalCost As Decimal 'Variable declared with no assignment. decTotalCost = 0 'Call a function to ensure the number of gbs is valid blnNumberInGBUsageIsValid = ValidateGBUsageInPlan() 'Logic, decTotalCost still equals 0 'Call a function to ensure the plan type was selected intPlanChoice = ValidatePlanSelection(blnPlanIsSelected, strSelectedPlan) 'More logic. If (blnNumberInGBUsageIsValid And blnPlanIsSelected) Then 'More logic. intGBUsage = Convert.ToInt32(txtGBUsed.Text) 'Assigns a value to intGBUsage. 'Display the cost lblTotalBill.Text = "Cost: " &amp; decTotalCost.ToString("C") 'DecTotalCost which is still 0. End If Somewhere in there you need to assign a value to decTotalCost or it will always be zero. (Edited to fix some line wrapping.)
Something like this could work Dim screens As Screen() = Screen.AllScreens Dim selected_screen As Screen = Nothing For Each i In screens 'pick screen Next 'set form to = selected_screen.WorkingArea 
I think for an assignment that doesn't need to be kept up to date, it's a fairly good one. It'd be a bit of a pain if you needed to ever look at it again though. First step of the code, I'd normalise whatever was entered to Zulu time (+/-0), then adjust it to the new timezone from there; should be fairly simple. I won't give code (partially because you haven't given the version you're using and partially because I think people remember things better when they look up the specific details themselves), but here's some very rough pseudo-pseudocode of how I would go about it. Hopefully you'll be able to understand what I'm getting at. Form: 2x command buttons (cmdReset, cmdSubmit), 2x combo boxes (cboFrom, cboTo), 1x textbox (txtInput), 1x label (lblOutput) [On Initialize] Create an array with each time offset, from biggest negative to biggest positive (-12, -11 ... +2, ...+12). Populate two comboboxes with names corresponding to each offset. The idea is that you take the current index position of each combobox to reference the appropriate offset in the array (i.e. cboFrom(0) and cboTo(0) = "International Date Line West" and aIntOffsets(0) = -12) [On cmdSubmit.click] Take the date entered in the textbox and convert it to that time at offset +/-0. [offset - (offset*2)] will convert a negative offset to positive and vice versa; this will give you the amount of time you need to add/subtract. Repeat the above, adding the To offset to your normalised date. Display the new date in lblOutput/caption. [On cmdReset.click] Reset everything I'd be using three subs (Initialize and one for each button on click) and one function (to manipulate the dates).
Depending on the number of check boxes you have, you could use bit flagging to add/subtract numbers easily.

tomtom999, this code looks super familiar. If it's what I think it is [SQLControl], I can help you refine it quite a bit if you like. I've cleaned it up a great deal since it was "RunQuery". One problem I've encountered with this is, in this line: DGVData.DataSource = Sql.SQLDataSet.Tables(0) Error checking should be done prior to attempting to set the DataSource. If there are any errors in your query or command a DataTable [Tables(0)] will not be generated and will crash on the empty array. With the new SQLControl the whole thing will look like: Private Sub RefreshGrid() ' EXECUTE QUERY SQL.ExecQuery("SELECT something1, something2 FROM mytable ") ' REPORT &amp; ABORT ON ERRORS If NoErrors(True) = False Then Exit Sub ' OUTPUT QUERY RESULTS If SQL.RecordCount &gt; 0 Then DGVData.DataSource = SQL.DT End Sub It's much more stable and clean, and also supports easy parameterization of your queries and commands.
You might consider on installing your custom DLLs, you write an entry into a config/ini file for the core program. The Core reads that and loads the necessary DLLs. Alternatively, you can create a license key scheme that does the same. xxxx-yyyyyyyyy-zzzzz where x = serial number, y = options and z = expiration date. Then you just need to decode the license key and enable only the functions that are allowed. 
Didn't know it was this simple, thanks!
Sorry man, I can't, for the life of me, figure out how to do it. I'm totally new to vbscripts, or scripting at all. lol
Figured it out. I did this: str = lmao1 &amp;_ lmao2 &amp;_ lmao3 &amp;_ Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile("output.txt", True) objFile.WriteLine(str) objFile.Close It would go up to lmao100 &amp;_ lmao101 (lmao101 is to end it) 
Hmm, if I understand your situation then, you will almost certainly need a Regex for validation. Maybe something like this: "\d+(\.\d+)*"

I've not explored the idea of what is effectively an ini file, though if I were to do that, even with as unconcerned with piracy as I am, I would not use a text file to check for unlocking, as I would use the internal database and populate the table with a column of strings that were all RNG generated(at creation, then static), and a 2nd column that would be based off a convoluted mathematical logic, that would need to be followed, and another column with a simple number, that would only logically make sense to me, as order of creation
Winforms? WPF? Do you need to know VB6 to maintain legacy stuff, or is it all .net? What's your current development background?
How do you get offered a job for something you have no experience using? Not trying to be disrespectful but learning VB is a little different than coming into a job and figuring out what someone else has coded. 
 Dim tsValue As TimeSpan = TimeSpan.Zero 'Declare your time variable If TimeSpan.TryParse(txtTextbox.Text.Trim, tsValue) Then 'Try to parse input from TextBox 'At this point you can now compare the time entered by the user to the time of day If Date.Now.TimeOfDay = tsValue Then MessageBox.Show(String.Format("Messagebox at {0}", tsValue.ToString)) End If Else MessageBox.Show("Invalid time input") End If I'm on mobile so can't guarantee this will compile but you'll at least get the gist.

I can't believe how many times I've seen this exact same story. And here I am, still waiting for such an opportunity... Okay, lamenting aside, you really just can't "learn VB quickly" because programming is a vast and nebulous thing. You first need to understand what problems lie ahead before you can properly equip yourself to deal with them. For example, it's not going to do you any good to focus on mastering form design and interaction if the problem you face has to do with sockets or TCP/IP programming. Similarly, it won't do you any good to master network programming if the problem before you is related to database connectivity and design. You can spend years going down any of these rabbit holes. Know your problem first, then learn the basics of that specific programming discipline. Beyond that, your ultimate resources are going to be Google and Youtube. Books are all fine and great for learning the basics of syntax and giving a few pointers on tasks usually irrelevant to your specific needs. Learn the basics of syntax and then take a problem:solution approach and you can't go wrong. After some time of "How do I...?" you'll amass an arsenal of skills.
Sorry if my example was a bit confusing. I've updated it a bit and commented as well to clarify and included some reference links. I understand it can look a bit advanced for you, but take the opportunity to learn from it. An important part of learning to write code is cleansing user input and validating that input. You can never trust what a user provides will be the correct format that you need. The code snippet above should be easily work in your Form1 Timer function to validate the user input and display a message box to them.
If your code is executed by Timer.Tick what is the Interval for each Tick? If it's greater than 1 second that could be a problem.
On second thought. Your timer may not fire fast enough to catch the milliseconds exactly! Try this: If Date.Now.TimeOfDay.Hour = tsValue.Hour AndAlso Date.Now.TimeOfDay.Minute = tsValue.Minute AndAlso Date.Now.TimeOfDay.Second = tsValue.Second Then 'MessageBox End If
The timer interval is 1000 ms.
I don't think this is the problem, for some reason it does not read the time from the textbox and that is why nothing happens. I don't get any errors or warnings so... but I still feel like I'm being misunderstood or I just can't explain myself clear enough in English. Check out this screenshot if you have some time, it explains exactly what I need. If someone could write down the code for this simple form, I could easily use it on my project. (http://i.imgur.com/tIBfe9U.png)
It's because a MessageBox blocks the code execution. i.e. Until you click ok or whatever on the Messagebox, the next line of code won't execute. When there's no MessageBox, the code executes, and you can't see the difference because it's updating too fast. Please clarify on what you want to achieve?
ok, so have a button named Submit or something. Have a public variable(x) to note what question it is currently on. Increment x every time the user clicks submit and use x to determine next question. e.g. Dim x as Integer = 0 Public Sub ... Handles btnSubmit.Click Insert Code to Store Answer - Note: Make sure that this code is not executed on the init/loading of the first question. You could make it so that the program automatically loads the first question on the loading of the form and avoid this. If x is less than 25 x+=1 Textbox1.text = array(x-1).stringvariable ' x-1 because array index starts at 0 ' Deselect both radiobuttons to avoid confusion. Else ' Test Finished ' Disable Submit button, Display Results etc. End If End Sub Also, it might be better to display a question using a Label with AutoSize = False - so that it looks better and to make sure that the user can't edit it. 
You are not appending the textbox, you just keep overwriting it. Look up the &amp; (ampersand) operator (aka concatenate)
 Textbox1.text += array(x).stringvariable &amp; " " You forgot the +=
Everything seems to check out just fine. Just gotta give it time to process everything. Below is the exact code I ran (modification of yours) to get the results. 10^-15 results in 103375368 iterations. Sub Main() Console.WriteLine("Enter the value to approach 1/4") Dim x As Decimal = Console.ReadLine() Dim c As Decimal = (0.25 + x) Dim z As Decimal = (0.25 + x) Dim i As Decimal = 1 Do While z &lt; 2 i = i + 1 z = c + (z ^ 2) If i Mod 1000000 = 0 Then Console.WriteLine("Iteration: " &amp; i.ToString &amp; " Value: " &amp; z.ToString) End If Loop Console.WriteLine("Iterations until greater than 2: " &amp; i) Dim answer As String = Console.ReadLine() Console.ReadLine() End Sub
That just looks like 1 Form is all that is needed. Why do you need 2 Forms? When you try accessing the Form2 TextBox it can complicate things.. Try making this all work similar to what the screenshot is by using just 1 Form with a TextBox on that form and also a Timer for that Form with an interval of 500 plus the If statement above comparing only hours, minutes and seconds, not milliseconds. Remember to put a time that is actually coming up shortly, like a minute into the future and then wait.
One thing that might be an issue is `(z ^ 2)`. The `^` operator is only defined for doubles and Doubles take precedence over Decimals, so `c + (z ^ 2)` will be calculated as Doubles and only converted back to a Decimal when assigned to `z`, which will lead to continuous loss of precision. Just use `z * z`, it's probably faster anyway. Same goes for `(0.25 + x)`. Fraction literals are always Doubles unless they have a type suffix (e.g `0.25D`), so this will convert `x` to a Double, add that to the Double 0.25, and convert it back to a Decimal. I would recommend turning on Option Strict, which will prohibit implicit narrowing type conversions. This requires writing more verbose code to convert between types that aren't guaranteed to be compatible, but also highlights a lot of subtle mistakes.
Turns out I won't have enough time for this one to complete its iterations. What I've noticed though, is not every single power of x will return something similar to pi. Even coefficients return something similar. Odd coefficients sometimes do or don't.
Thanks for looking - That is actually what made me think this was weird - why would only some come out to be related to pi? It's not some sort of limit that approaches pi, the number of iterations always bounces around (while enlarging) occasionally hitting near pi.
Awesome, I will try those modifications and let you know if it changes my results.
You should looking into the ratios of Fibonacci numbers if you are interested in things of this nature. If you divide the larger of any two Fibonacci numbers by its predecessor, you get a ratio. As the numbers get larger, the ratio becomes closer and closer to phi, the golden ratio.
This is awesome! Thanks man!
