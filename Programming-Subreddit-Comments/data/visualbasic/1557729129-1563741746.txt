Basic game copies, any catalog type stuff like cds or dvds. Make a journaling prgram and use it for taking notes. You basically want to recreate something already around. Notepad programs with more advanced stuff like Evernote etc
Yeah, there are just so many other alternatives out there that is better than vb. I used to make games with vb as well but there are just a lot of limitations to it.

The two are so similar you should be able to become familiar with both at the same time. There are slight differences in terms of what VBA is able to do, but overall are negligible when you need different projects/ideas to tinker with.
Ok noted... thank you for the reply...
If I understand, you need to make intNew and intOld match the card values, correct?
Yes correct. im sitting here for 3 hours now and im still figuring out.
Ok well since it's homework I'm not going to tell you the answer directly. But I can get you in the right direction. First thing, are you familiar with passing parameters into methods? And getting return values from those methods? If not watch a quick video on that. Second thing, ask yourself *How does my program know which card to display*? It's in your post. Then ask yourself *What steps do I need to take when I decide which card to show*? Think of an actual deck of cards, when do you know what value is on the card? As soon as you see it right? Finally, if my hints are too vague, this is what I'm actually trying to say: &gt;!Set the value of the variables within the switch statement. Possibly even moving it within it's own method and returning the value to the variable!&lt; I hope I understand correctly what you're trying to do and I hope this helps.
Of course, there are already some very good game engines, but none of them allow the use of VB.NET. Today developers choose ease by changing language to achieve their goals, it is respectable but it does not help to innovate. We can see in the world of the web, that every 6 months, new technologies emerge, although there are already tools that work very well. As for example the use of javascript server side was unthinkable until the arrival of NodeJS. And on the side of games, dominated by the C++, C# was very criticized in its beginnings, whereas today it is very common in game development. Today, with the new popularity of VB.NET nothing prevents it from having a permanent place in the world of video games. A small place, and for games only Windows but a place anyway. The problem now is the lack of tools, but the job of a developer, is it not to solve problems? ;-)
Try just msgbox maybe
What is the error you get? Your code isn't formatted in your post so I'm not sure if it's the line return in it or not
this is what it says in Error list: &amp;#x200B; Severity Code Description Project File Line Suppression State Error BC30519 Overload resolution failed because no accessible 'Show' can be called without a narrowing conversion: 'Public Shared Overloads Function Show(text As String, caption As String) As DialogResult': Argument matching parameter 'caption' narrows from 'MessageBoxButtons' to 'String'.

So that means you're trying to call an over load function on messagebox.show which doesn't exist. MessageBox.Show("Welcome " &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; "! You are " &amp; years &amp; " So you can play! Are you ready?", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo) There is no overload that takes in a string, and then the MessageBoxButtons.YesNo argument I haven't tested this but looking a little it looks like you need a second param before the yes no i.e. MessageBox.Show("Welcome " &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; "! You are " &amp; years &amp; " So you can play! Are you ready?", "Some Caption For Your Box Here", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo) try that
It's because the Show method is expecting another string (the window caption) prior to what buttons you want to display. If you look at the overload 5 which is the first overload to not expect an `owner` variable as the first argument you will see that what you are expected to enter is: `text As String` This is what you want to relay to the user. `caption As String` This is the title of the dialog box but you're trying to use the buttons `buttons as MessageBoxButtons` Here is where you would put your YesNo option. If MessageBox.Show("Welcome " &amp; TextBox1.Text &amp; _ " you are " &amp; years &amp; " So you can play! Are you ready?", "You Qualify!!!", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo) = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.Yes Then Notice I added the "You Qualify!!!" caption that's expected.
so the way to "jump" the "caption as string" is to open and close quotation marks with nothing inside them, right?
Yes or `Nothing` or `String.Empty` all should work.
If you type messagebox.show( It will tell you exactly what parameters it wants. Also don't be afraid to look at the MSDN page for the messagebox, it's pretty helpful. you're probably wanting to set your yesno option to 3 for yes and no selections.
Don't know why people are downvoting you. I only use [messagebox.show](https://messagebox.show) when I need to compare it to vbYes/vbNo/etc in an if statement. Otherwise, it's just crazy stupid easy to just type MsgBox("Text here", 4096, "Info") instead of the long drawn out stuff that [messagebox.show](https://messagebox.show) requires when all you want is a simple message box.
I could be way off, but doesn't a new point take two arguments? One for X and one for Y?
it does, but the code accepts that as valid data. So it would look like picturebox.location = New Point ({X=373,Y=266}) I will try and splice out the extra date and see if thats the case
if you have your app installed, you should probably be able to right click -&gt; unmount
Progress bar control.
Is your ScaleMode set to pixel? By default its annoyingly set to Twips
Ive never done this before. Where would I go to check (Using Visual Studio)
If it’s a script file you may want to use she’ll command. Shell is like running command line commands
I’ve managed to create a form.vb in Visual Basic which has the textboxes linked to .txt files and buttons linked to the .vbs scripts. I’d like to save the form.vb file in the folder with the text files and .vbs scripts. How do I save the file so that it will run outside Visual Basic studio software?
Convert to a .exe if possible
I'm not sure why you're not getting some form of exception. If you set `Option Strict On` at the top of your code, you will receive an error message that no overload accepts this number of arguments. In other words, New Point cannot parse "{X=373,Y=266}". You could create a method that can parse that string back into a point and use it each time you want to set the location to the saved value. An easy way to do this is to put the string into a regular expression to remove the extra characters ({}XY=) by replacing them with a blank string ("") and split on the comma, then return a new point back to the calling routing to pass on to the location. For this example you will need to add `Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions` to the top of your code window Create the following Function ''' &lt;summary&gt; ''' &lt;para&gt;Parses the format of {X=123,Y=123} and returns a Point&lt;/para&gt; ''' The format comes from the .ToString() method of converting a Point to String ''' &lt;/summary&gt; ''' &lt;param name="source"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; ''' &lt;returns&gt;System.Drawing.Point&lt;/returns&gt; Function ParseStringToPoint(source As String) As Point Dim value = Regex.Replace(source, "[\{\}a-zA-Z=]", "").Split(","c) Return New Point(CInt(value(0)), CInt(value(1))) End Function Then you can just read the line using the StreamReader as you pass it to the new method to set a location PictureBox1.Location = ParseStringToPoint(sr.ReadLine)
What framework are you using? WPF or WinForms?
Public shared makes your variable global.
I’m using the Visual Basic Express software which gives me a window which I designed with text boxes and buttons to link to text files and vbs scripts. I managed to find the .exe for the window which did display. I run the window on my server 2016 after got a prompt to update .Net Framework 3.5 (includes 2.0 and 3.0). I also use PSExec for one of my scripts to remote onto one computer which also copies another script to it and runs. Unfortunately the command prompt window would remain displayed during the process. But the command prompt window now just flashes on the screen and disappears. Trying to work out why as it worked for me previously.
Okay, so you’re working with WinForms. And what version of .NET are you targeting? If it’s higher than the version installed on the server you’ll need to update to the latest version on the server.
Okay, so you’re working with WinForms. And what version of .NET are you targeting? If it’s higher than the version installed on the server you’ll need to update to the latest version on the server.
.Net Framework 3.5. I installed it on my server 2016 using the features option. I’m guessing I may need up update it further on the server.
I take it you’re new to this. You have two versions, the one you are targeting, as in compiling your app to support, and then the installed version.
I’m an very new to this sorry. Should have mentioned that.
The properties page that you mentioned. Is that on each of my vbs scripts?
No. The properties page for your project, aka, your solution.
Ah the project in Visual Basic?
do you just want to create a "launcher" for yor vbs? if that is the case, why do you not use a .bat file or a powershell script?
I’m looking at a PowerShell script at a later date. I have been tasked to make it easier for someone to run scripts by creating a Visual Basic window with text boxes and buttons linked to text file inputs and scripts instead of them having to type in commands to get the scripts to run.
What the user will put in the text box? The filename? And the button to execute the script?
Compile it?
It’s a USMT function I’m putting into a GUI vb form so when the user types in the PC name into the text box, press a button to run the first script to read the text box and start the first process (scanstate) and then repeat this for the next script to start the second process (loadstate).
I’ve found the exe after compiling the vb file.
Using 5 different forms? You can use 1 and just hide/show some labels/picture boxes or frames. Well if you're going yo stick with that, use a module. Set global variables there
You should just use one form and use the MessageBox.Show method for each question. You could display the user’s given answers in the form.
I'm using radio buttons to put options for the person to choose, I don't think it is possible to put radiobuttons inside a messagebox, is it?
Is there more than one player?
nope
Are the questions true or false or does the user type their answer?
You could use buttons instead of radio buttons and program each button like this. Create a final form which shows the results and add a label called something like "lblscore" In all of the forms write: `Public score As Integer` \[Code for button with correct answer\] `score = score + 1` `form(whatever the final form is called).lblscore.text = score` Add a label in the current form aswell called something like "lblanswer" and add a number for each question form e.g. "lblanswer2" so you can program each label. Add code `lblanswer.text = "Correct!"` \[Code for button with incorrect answer\] (If you are removing points then write) `score = score - 1` `form(whatever the final form is called).lblscore.text = score` &amp;#x200B; Add code `lblanswer.text = "Incrrect!"` This should work.
thenks man! I'm actually using message boxes instead of labels, is it okay?
You could use the. DayOfYear property of the date to decide which row the login is placed on. You would need a separate sheet for each year, or use one sheet and calculate and offset based on the year. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.dayofyear?view=netframework-4.8
Try running a rebuild instead of a build?
btw, Why shouldn't I use radio buttons?
**on form1 pic click** Dim picNew as New Picturebox ... All properties for image here... MainForm.Controls.Add(picNew) **for click function on picNew** Add an event handler with public sub. Watch videos on 'dynamic controls with event handler'.
Don't "Unload" MainForm. If you don't whant it to show just "Form.Visible = False". Hope it helps, or send code
Also, you can reference controls on other loaded forms by putting the name of the form in front of the control name. For example, from Form1 you can reference the picturebox on MainForm by using MainForm.PictureBox1. This works for any control on the form as long as you keep the form loaded like u/MexBee said.
I just tried it, and got an error message, the same I was already getting: ‘ProjectName.MainForm.label5’ is not accessible in this context, because it is private (BC30390). I checked it and it is public. I saw on the internet that I need to make it public, but it already is. Then, I saw that the module for mainform needs to be private, but I’m not using a module. I tried making a change in a label from mainform to form1 and vice versa, to see if me clicking on the picture did anything. The only thing I have to do is that a click of a picture from one form does something on the other. Do you know how to solve this?
Use *Public shared* in VB.NET and *Public Static* in C#. Hope it works.
How many columns does your data have? This may not work for you, but I did something similar using a custom function I found on Google. Insert the below module in VBA to create an =concatenateif() function, this will allow you to find all instances in a column and combine into a single text string in a single cell. You can add spacing or nest in other formulas to format. Then just run your macro and reference that cell, it will all go into the single textbox. `Function ConcatenateIf(CriteriaRange As Range, Condition As Variant, ConcatenateRange As Range, Optional Separator As String = ",") As Variant Dim xResult As String On Error Resume Next If CriteriaRange.Count &lt;&gt; ConcatenateRange.Count Then ConcatenateIf = CVErr(xlErrRef) Exit Function End If For i = 1 To CriteriaRange.Count If CriteriaRange.Cells(i).Value = Condition Then xResult = xResult &amp; Separator &amp; ConcatenateRange.Cells(i).Value End If Next i If xResult &lt;&gt; "" Then xResult = VBA.Mid(xResult, VBA.Len(Separator) + 1) End If ConcatenateIf = xResult Exit Function End Function`
You were very close &amp;#x200B; Dim results as string = "" `Using reader As New StreamReader("Test.txt")` `While Not reader.EndOfStream` `Dim line As String = reader.ReadLine()` `If line.Contains("user") Then` results &amp;= line `Exit While` `End If` `End While End Using` &amp;#x200B; `TextBox1.Text =` results
&gt;Thank you for helping! I am trying what you suggested and it is still only giving me the first line with "user". &gt; &gt;Can you see anything that I am missing? Any help is greatly appreciated! Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim results1 As String = "" Using reader As New StreamReader("users.txt") While Not reader.EndOfStream Dim line As String = reader.ReadLine() If line.Contains("users") Then results1 &amp;= line Exit While End If End While End Using RichTextBox1.Text = results1
Looks like you're exiting the while loop once you find the first hit, instead of just adding it to a list or a text box and continuing to the next line.
Thanks! Looks like I got it working now that I removed the "Exit While" line.
You could. I am more experienced with checkboxes that’s why I didn’t mention them.
Didn't work. Just tried on a different computer, same issue, so it looks like a problem with the project rather than the computer.
How about &amp;#x200B; `Dim foundLines As List(Of String) = File.ReadAllLines("MyText.txt").ToList.FindAll(Function(x As String) x.Contains("User"))` `For Each line As String In foundLines` `TextBox1.Text = TextBox1.Text &amp; line &amp; vbCrLf` `Next` &amp;#x200B; It seems to work for me, but you might have a particular format that doesnt agree with this code :)
Make a backup. Then go into the folder and rename/delete the .vs folder (it's hidden so you might have to show hidden files). This will be rebuilt when you run the application in the IDE. If that doesn't work, then I would also do the same thing to the bin and obj folders. (NOTE: If you have manually moved anything into the bin path you will need to put that back. ie, Database file, text file used for testing, etc...) VS will only build the core files that it compiles.
Looks like it did the trick. Thank you.
what's the RLE schema? Nibble? len = int(asc(mid$(stream,pos,1))/16) val = asc(mid$(stream,pos,1)) and 15 or byte? len = asc(mid$(stream,pos,1)) val = asc(mid$(stream,pos+1,1)) or....??? and expand like so for i = 0 to len+1 print val next
Hey, that works too! Thank you!
Excellent!!
No....
Any reason you are using VB6 and not VB.Net? There are a lot of .NET libraries that allow you to work with PDF's and documents.
The project I've joined onto has been going for several years, so it would be too much time investment to switch to VB.Net at this stage.
You can use the RichTextBox control to save RTF files. As that's essentially what they are (rich text). There are likely third party libraries you can use but not off the top of my head for VB6.
Is it possible to save RTF files from a RichTextBox control with images?
Yeah I use pdf sharp on .net
You can probably compose a postscript file in vb6 and then automate the pdf conversion through ghostscript 🤔
Using a PDF printer might be easier.. or saving as an image.
Yes, but IIRC getting images into an RTF box was nightmarish and incredibly bloating. The data for the image is stored in plaintext, up to 12 characters per pixel
this might work for you, its a easy way to obtain PDFs
Not sure what is going on with that example but it's pretty old. Does this one help at all? http://forum.codecall.net/topic/69309-writing-and-reading-xml-files-vbnet-part-i/ Also, do you have some constraints that are forcing you to use xml? SQL Express is free for databases up to 4 or 8 G (I can't remember for sure) and it would be a much more modern (and easier) way to read and write your data, as you could use entity framework. For that matter, you could even just add a service based database to your project, which is basically a flat file db, where you could create tables and what not in visual studio, and then just use EF on that. If you have to use xml and are still running into issues after that other tutorial, let me know some specifics on where exactly you're having problems and I can help more.
Thank you for your reply. I just wanted to use XML for simplicity (so much for that hahaha). The project will be quite small so I figured it would be more appropriate. I'm making a DnD DM assist. So I can run premade campaigns, the idea is to have a table to track all the monsters stat blocks and another table to track player progression. I'd like to poll monster hp, ac etc.. to make large scale battles quicker to manage. (If you have to roll 3 dices for 12 monsters it can get tedious quite fast). I don't mind switching over to SQLE though. I'll take a look at the link you provided for XML during my lunch break! Thanks again! I'll update on my progress.
Oh I'd definitely recommend at a min you go the DB flat file route, so you can work with tables. You want a database because I can see that getting more complicated than you anticipate fast, and managing that in xml would be a nightmare. For something like this that is a pet project, the flat file (mdb) might be your best route because it can all sit in one code base and should you ever need to move it to another machine, you don't have to set up sql server, move the database, etc. It's all contained in the file system in your project. If you have an example of what you were thinking your xml structure was going to look like, I can help you get something going
I think you are absolutely right about using access for this idea. Its one of the reasons I wanted to use an XML, in case I have to move the software to a new machine it would be a bit of a bother to install a new instance of SQL and then migrate the database. Here is what I have so far for the XML file. The reading/editing/writing part of the program works well enough with the integrated tools. (I just drag/drop the table's column into the form) &amp;#x200B; &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt; &lt;DsEntities xmlns="http://tempuri.org/DsEntities.xsd"&gt; &lt;Entities&gt; &lt;EntityID&gt;0&lt;/EntityID&gt; &lt;Name&gt;Goblin&lt;/Name&gt; &lt;Size&gt;Small Humanoid&lt;/Size&gt; &lt;ArmorClass&gt;15&lt;/ArmorClass&gt; &lt;Hitpoints&gt;7&lt;/Hitpoints&gt; &lt;Speed&gt;30 ft.&lt;/Speed&gt; &lt;Strength&gt;8 (-1)&lt;/Strength&gt; &lt;Dexterity&gt;14 (+2)&lt;/Dexterity&gt; &lt;Constitution&gt;10 (+0)&lt;/Constitution&gt; &lt;Intelligence&gt;10 (+0)&lt;/Intelligence&gt; &lt;Wisdom&gt;8 (-1)&lt;/Wisdom&gt; &lt;Charisma&gt;8 (-1)&lt;/Charisma&gt; &lt;Skills&gt;Stealth +6&lt;/Skills&gt; &lt;Senses&gt;Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 9&lt;/Senses&gt; &lt;Languages&gt;Common, Goblin&lt;/Languages&gt; &lt;Challenge&gt;1/4 (50xp)&lt;/Challenge&gt; &lt;Particularity&gt;Nimble Escape: The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.&lt;/Particularity&gt; &lt;Actions&gt;Scimitar: +4 to hit. Reach 5 ft. One Target. Hit: 1d6+2 Slashing Dmg Shortbow: +4 to hit. Reach 80/320 ft. One Target. Hit: 1d6+2 Piercing Dmg&lt;/Actions&gt; &lt;/Entities&gt; &lt;Entities&gt; &lt;EntityID&gt;1&lt;/EntityID&gt; &lt;Name&gt;Hobgoblin&lt;/Name&gt; &lt;Size&gt;Medium Humanoid&lt;/Size&gt; &lt;ArmorClass&gt;18&lt;/ArmorClass&gt; &lt;Hitpoints&gt;11&lt;/Hitpoints&gt; &lt;Speed&gt;30 ft.&lt;/Speed&gt; &lt;Strength&gt;13 (+1)&lt;/Strength&gt; &lt;Dexterity&gt;12 (+1)&lt;/Dexterity&gt; &lt;Constitution&gt;12 (+1)&lt;/Constitution&gt; &lt;Intelligence&gt;10 (+0)&lt;/Intelligence&gt; &lt;Wisdom&gt;10 (+0)&lt;/Wisdom&gt; &lt;Charisma&gt;9 (-1)&lt;/Charisma&gt; &lt;Skills&gt;--&lt;/Skills&gt; &lt;Senses&gt;Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 10&lt;/Senses&gt; &lt;Languages&gt;Common, Goblin&lt;/Languages&gt; &lt;Challenge&gt;1/2 (100XP)&lt;/Challenge&gt; &lt;Particularity&gt;Martial Advantage: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 2d6 damage to a creature&lt;/Particularity&gt; &lt;/Entities&gt; &lt;/DsEntities&gt; The player table would be a little more simplistic as I want the players to retain their "ability" to roll their own dices (its part of the fun!) &amp;#x200B; So basically, a column for each "variables" of said entity(in this case monster), Name, Size, Alignment, ArmorClass, Hitpoints, Speed, Str,Dex,Con,Int,Wis,Cha,Skills,Senses,Languages,Challenge rating,Special stuff and then Actions. I might want to split Combat actions from "Standard" actions so I can query the column/row and parse it in order to only get the xDx +X (example : 1d6 + 2 of damage) to then use this for multiple monster dice rolls. So for example, 6 goblins will each roll a d20 to determine if it can hit or not the target. Then they will each roll a d6 + 2 to determine damage. In this scenario, the program would save me 12 die throw making the combat phase alot faster.
Are these attributes set in stone, like you won't be adding more? The reason I ask is because if we wanted to go uber crazy on schema normalization, you'd have an entity table with things like name, description, etc. Then an attributes catalog table, that holds the attribute name and what not, and then a join table that links any given attribute to an entity. The reasons I can see for doing that are because you might have some attributes that only apply to certain classes and what not. Now, the simple way to do it would basically be making an entity table with all the columns you mentioned (speed, strength, dex, etc.) but if some classes use them and some don't, that would mean you end up with columns not always used. My guess is my normalization suggestion is a little bit of overkill, so I thought I'd just ask. If you're good with one table with all the attributes as columns, and don't expect to be adding tons of new attributes, I'd say we go that route. If so, I can throw something together really quick to get you started.
Also, are you dead set on VB? I can definitely do it in that, but generally speaking, anything new you do in .net you'd want to do in C#. However, if you want to stick with VB I can definitely do it in that (I work in both daily) just thought I'd also offer up that tidbit.
Oh and last thing, what version of .net are you targeting and what version of Visual Studio are you using?
Hi Andrew, Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it. I'm going to reply to your questions in a single reply. &amp;#x200B; 1. The attributes are set in stone for the monsters, **they will not be for players**. Every couple of levels a player character earns 2 points he can distribute in his stats. Its also possible for a player to equip an item that grants him for example +1 STR. 2. I am not dead set on [VB.NET](https://VB.NET), I did a bit of C# back in the days but I wanted to keep this project in known territories. I also take this as a bit of a challenge because even though its not my job, I still enjoy programming. I'm pretty good at finding code, understanding it and blend it in the rest of my project. I couldn't program to save my life without google but heh :P. 3. I'm using Visual Studio 2019 CE.
We can stick with VB, it's not a huge deal. I'll see if I can throw something together for you quick.
I’m not that experienced with Visual Basic but I have never done problem 1 with an If statement. It can be done in one line on the button click sub. Threezero.backcolor = color.lightgreen When the button is clicked it turns green. If it is already green or grey it does not matter.
Thanks for your answer, with the three lines i wanted to assure when the button is grey it turns green and if it green to turn gray again, so you can see what you have selected and what not.
For problem 2 can’t you do something like this If threezero.backolor = color.lightgreen then Print code here Elseif If fourzero.backcolor = color.lightgreen then Print code here Elseif 5zero.backcolor = color.lightgreen then Print code here Endif Buttons would need to stay green though until you click for example reset buttons button
Yeah thats a good idea i will try it out :)
OK looking at problem 1 - change your code to &amp;#x200B; `Dim btn As Button = CType(sender, Button)` `If btn.BackColor = Color.LightGray Then` `btn.BackColor = Color.LightGreen` `Else : btn.BackColor = Color.LightGray` `End If` In the parameters for the handler, the sender is the object that raised the event, so if you click button TwoZero, the sender parameter will refer to that button. So, you can use the same code in each button's click event handler. Then you can just copy and paste it into the sub for each button. If the button click handler only changes the button colour and nothing else, then you could have just one event handler for all your buttons, but for now I would advise against that in case you want to add different code to specific buttons. &amp;#x200B; For problem 2, this should work. What is does is go through all the controls on your form and if any of them are green buttons, it should print the file associated with that button &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Print_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles` [`Print.Click`](https://Print.Click) `For Each ctl As Control In Controls` `Dim btn As Button` `If ctl.GetType() = GetType(Button) Then` `btn = CType(ctl, Button)` `myFilenameString = btn.Text` `End If` `myFilenameString = TwoZero.Text` `p.Verb = "print"` `p.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden` `p.FileName = "D:\Einleger\" &amp; myFilenameString &amp; ".doc" 'This is the file name` `p.UseShellExecute = True` `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(p)` `End If` `Next` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; Any probs, let me know.
Wow I just tried your first Solution it works so perfect and well, It you dont have to change the button name every time :D. I will try later the print option but thank you in advance for the work you did for me. A small question do you know how to make a reset button to turn all light green ones back to light gray? """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Private Sub Reset\_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles [Reset.Click](https://Reset.Click) Dim cml As Control If cml.BackColor = Color.LightGray Then cml.BackColor = Color.AliceBlue End If End Sub """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Because like this i dont want to work.
&gt;No probs. Same principle as the print sub. loop through all the controls. If any one of them is a button types, and the background colour is green, change it to LightGray. `Private Sub Reset_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles` [`Reset.Click`](https://Reset.Click) `For Each ctl As Control In Controls` `Dim btn As Button` `If ctl.GetType() = GetType(Button) Then` `btn = CType(ctl, Button)` `If btn.BackColor = Color.LightGreen Then` `btn.BackColor = Color.LightGray` `End If` `End If` `Next` `End Sub`
&gt;It works brilliant thank you, I changed the code for the printing a little bit so that it t first saves the buttontexts into a label and after that it will print from it :) because at your solution for printing my Word programm runs like wild and pops up like 20 Attention POP UPS. But even so you Code help me more then a lot and I cant thank you enough i only have now two problems left until my programm is perfect &gt; &gt;1. When I save my Buttontexts in Checkboxlist and sort it by number(So that the lowest number comes at the beginning) 2.11 is before 2.7 for example (Its only a very small issue but if you have anything in mind I would be happy to hear it :)) &gt; &gt;[2. At](https://2.At) my Company the Standard Printer is different one then mine, so do you maybe now how i could change that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So thats how it looks at the moment &gt; &gt;[https://imgur.com/a/7fWS5f7](https://imgur.com/a/7fWS5f7)
I'm Not sure about your second question.. you might have to ask your system administrator about that on. However. Your first question .. The reason Is that the text in your CheckedListBox is just that - text - the computer doesn't see it as a number because it is defined as text. So when the list is sorted, it sorts all the list by comparing the first character in each item, the by comparing the 2nd and then by the 3rd, an so on. When the computer is comparing "2.11" and "2.7" and it gets to the third character in the two strings, it will see that "1" comes before "7" in the character set, so it will always put that one first. How it should be sorted depends on the code you are using to generate the list. Would you be able to post that? I'm in the UK and it's 01:00 here so I'm off to sleep, but I may be around from 08:45 after the wife has gone to work :-)
Try using this in your sub &amp;#x200B; `CType(Controls.Find("textbox" &amp; x.ToString, True)(0), TextBox).Text = "Hello"` `CType(Controls.Find("textbox" &amp; (x + 1).ToString, True)(0), TextBox).Text = "World"` &amp;#x200B; What it does is to search all the controls in your form (including child controls) for a match to the string "textbox" &amp; x.Tostring. So if x =1 it will search for a control called "textbox1" and convert what it finds to a textbox type, to that you can then use textbox properties to assign values in just the same way as you would type `textbox1.Text="Hello"`. &amp;#x200B; if you dont want the search to include child controls then change `True` to `False` &amp;#x200B; Hope this works for you :)
I think the easiest way to do this would be to add your textboxes to a list, and refer to each one by its index. Declare the list: Dim textboxes as new List(of Textbox) Then add your textboxes: textboxes.add(textbox1) for each textbox you want You can then refer to them like this: textboxes(intIndex).text = "holla"
I've done this exact thing, what I did was initialize a variable called Currentnamebox as label Currentnamebox = form.controls("namebox" &amp; I) I being the index of whatever your control is, (1,2,3,4 whatever is at the end of the name) Then you can just call it by currentnamebox whenever you want.
Any way you can post your full project? If not, I'd put a breakpoint in where it sets the text as the code is could be getting executed twice somehow
Full project? I can email you the document itself, but what I posted above is pretty much the extent of the code that's on the UserForm. That's under the "OK" button at the bottom of the prompt that pops up.
Well yea because you posted code that gets set but we have no context on what event it's in, how it gets executed, etc.
Gotcha. I'm new to VB so my apologies. Could you PM me an email, and I can send this over to you? I assume it's a relatively easy fix, but I have no background with this type of stuff; I don't know what I don't know, so it's hard to pinpoint what I need to fix.
Only a thought - I'f you've generated the numbers in an array/List in the right order and they are being displayed out of order in the `CheckedListBox`, you might want to turn of the `.Sorted` property in the properties window of Visual Studio - usually on the lower right of your screen when you are viewing the Designer tab for your form.
No problem that's what this sub is for! If you can just zip your whole project and send it. If not, at least that full form and I'll see if I can help
Google visual basic read a text file. Your first step would be getting the data from the file

Whether it's the design aspect (which needs a lot of improvement) or some features in itself, let me know! Thank you!
Thanks! this is brilliant!
Hehe. No worries :)
What you want is SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). You can do exactly what you want with SQL driving the data.
Interesting. I’ve used SSRS very little but I’ll check it out Tuesday. I parameterize all my SQL queries in my program, can I just pass my parameters to the report?
I think so. I'm used to building them for other people to select the parameters but there are report viewer controls for WinForms that should allow exactly what you want.
Get your data to a listbox and simply scroll line by line out to the printer. Format it on the way out. YourFunctionToSetPrinter() Printer.FontSize = 8 Printer.Print "pallet#" + Cstr(paletID) . . Printer.EndDoc
Another option is Crystal Reports which should be on the visual studio CD
Hey man, I was wondering if you had a chance to review the doc I sent you? No rush, I just thought I should follow up to make sure I sent it to the right email.
I think I missed the email somehow, can you send it again? Sorry about that!
Not a problem at all, I will resend it. Thanks again for your patience/help.
Do you have to use arrays? You might do better with lists.
you don't. you can build a new array, but a more efficient way is to pass the array by reference and also pass a start index and number of items to process to the 2nd function. pass by reference has almost no ram cost and no extra CPU cost. making a 2nd array will have large cost.
Update: once I fiddled around with SSRS for a minute to figure out how to pass my variables to the report, it worked beautifully! Thank you very much Final!
No, i do not. I just thought of arrays.
The new way of doing it is with `Span&lt;T&gt;`, but I wouldn't bother unless there is serious performance considerations. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1?view=netstandard-2.1
&gt;but a more efficient way is to pass the array by reference and also pass a start index and number of items to process to the 2nd function Hmm, so change the first function to accept the starting offset (defaultingto 0) and have the wrapper increment the offset as required. I like that. Thank you. Aren't arrays always passed by reference?
maybe, I don't really keep up with vb.net
Ah, okay. I was just looking it up right now. Thank you for the help.
Thanx. That might be overkill here. It's simply that batches are limited to 30.
&gt; Aren't arrays always passed by reference? Yes, they are.
Excepting the rare performance sensitive code, the general habit is to use `List( of T)` or a subclass of `Collection(of T)`. Arrays are avoided because they are harder to use.
Lists is probably a better choice when you have a dynamic sized group of objects.
(/r/grauenwolf this reply is for you as well.) I'm rather ignorant in these matters, and i am reading all the replies. Thank you for trying to help! I am checking delivery times for FedEx tracking numbers via a web service. FedEx allows batch requests of up to 30 Tracking Ids per request. (Tracking Ids seem to be treated as strings, not numbers.) So, for example, if i have to check 42 Ids, i want to make 2 requests. I believe the normal case is less than 30 Ids, but it has been known to grow closer to perhaps 100. Starting with the sample code provided by FedEx i created a simple module to check multiple Ids. Currently i test with 3. I now want to change it to accept a set of ids, split it into sets of 30, make the requests, and reply to the caller with one set. So, to the caller, the limit of 30 is inconsequential. My idea was to require the caller to pass an array, to which i would reply with a second array, like a key/value pair, where the key if the Id and the value is the delivered time or null/empty. (Would it be better to require a two dimensional array from the caller, and then just update the array?) So, i figured i would create the 30 request function to do the work, and a wrapper around that to split the array into chunks of 30. That was where i came here to ask. Now you are both saying to use a List instead. If that is better, or just plain easier, so be it. I only thought to use an array due to basic familiarity. Please help me decide which is better. If you drop off a little explanation with it, i would be much obliged too.
What I would do is make a class. Make a class a single tracking number. Add the date, expected date, location, whatever info you want in the data. I would add a flag to set whether it has been checked or not and then just do a check on the first 30 that don't have a check. I think you might be making it more complicated than it needs to be, honestly. The list of the class will contain all the data you need and be easily accessible. you can even put a lot of the processing code inside the class. Makes it all snazzy.
The code is to be called from another program, that checks it and ups as well, both on schedule and on demand. I think it is best to let it be called as a separate module then to integrate it into the code. I'm not sure I want this code to update the table directly.
Fair enough. Just the data you need then.
Go to C:\\Users\\&lt;your username&gt;\\source\\repos\\&lt;your project name&gt;. I believe that path is correct, I'm not on a Windows machine right now so I'm just going off my memory. You should find all your normal project files you would find with &lt; VS2010.
If you use an ienumerable implemented class (like list or queue), you can use linq. Just pass the full list to your function, then use Linq's .Take(30) command to return the first 30. Loop until it's empty! (You may have to use skip and take together. I'm not at a computer to test. Link below!) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.take?view=netframework-4.8
That looks nice. I may review that tomorrow. Thank you.
Linq is a bit weird at first, especially when you get into lambdas, but it's really powerful for enumerable operations. You can even search a list, and return n elements that meet a specific criteria. Very useful!
In this particular case (which i ended up explaining in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/bu5lm1/vbnet_how_do_i_pass_part_of_an_array_to_a_function/ep7xft7/) in this thread, i just need to go through the list 30 at a time. I don't really need anything fancy, though. Lambdas are cool though.
Looks like I just figured out problem #2 using If InStr(UCase(TextBox1.Text), "3ASSET") Then MsgBox("Asset #") Else MsgBox("serial #") End If
Ok, back to it right now. You are suggesting that for the key/value pair (tracking id/delivery time) instead of using a two-dimensional array, i should create a class (type?) with two values and make a list of that. Looking a little more, it seems that Dictionary object is an associative array. If the caller populates the keys, the function can populate the values.
When I was working on a project like yours I looked at the dictionary object, but I discarded it for some reason that I can't really recall. Maybe I didn't like moving the objects in and out of the dictionary. I honestly don't remember. If I had to do what you are doing, I would create a class like you said and then make a list of that class. In reality there are 850 ways to do these things, for me, the list of class would be the easiest to work with and the least likely to allow bug creep.
you'd need to monitor the progress of the batch file. I'd use the Process class and its WaitForExit() method, but I'd also put it in a thread so it doesn't hold up the UI.
Apologies if I'm missing something, but would it not be an easy thing to add all the items to be queried into a Queue object an de queue 30 items at a time for checking?
Sounds reasonable. I am not an expert by any means, and i didn't even know Queue was an object. I am currently in middle of it and still thinking of an array in a loop while generating the request, and a Dictionary for the return. A queue certainly sound interesting though.
Thank you. Personal anecdotes mean quite a bit to me. I am currently working with the idea of passing in an array and passing out a Dictionary, because populating the dictionary should be easy. Something like: for each item in array if we have 30 generate request Add reply into dictionary end if next item in array
Thank you for pointing me in the right direction! Looks like I got this working for me with Dim p As New Process Dim psi As New ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c MY-COMMAND-HERE") p.StartInfo = psi p.Start() p.WaitForExit() Do you off the top of your head know how to put that in a thread?
use the Thread class. there's a few ways to use it. but also make sure your call to process the file is in the thread too. which will also get you into the Invoke() method... bit of a rabbit hole, but worth it for responsive automation UI. i do these things in c#, not vb.net, but it's the same classes. my VB use is really just vb6 and vbscript
Sounds good except the second line should read if we don't have 30 (in the dictionary). Instead of using a for next loop maybe use a while look that looks at the number of items in the dictionary (or reaches the end of the list). That way you don't go through the entire array each time. Also how are you going to handle the second or tenth time through the array? That's why maybe an array isn't the ideal venue, if you have a list of a class then you can put a flag in the class that says, processed, or a date stamp.
I thought the foreach would go through the array exactly once. use a counter in the foreach, and when it hits 30, send off the request, add the reply to the dictionary, and continue with the foreach. Am i missing something basic here? (no pun intended)
It will go through the entire array once. But once you hit 30 then you want it do whatever work you want on the dictionary. If you want to use the for next then you would have to watch the size of the dictionary and when it gets to 30 then process the dictionary data, clear the dictionary and start over again.
&gt; clear the dictionary and start over again. Why? I want to keep adding to it until it has all the requested data, which can be, let's say, 100 elements. The limitation on 30 is simply per request to FedEx, so every 30, i need to make the request, get the reply into the dictionary, and then build the next request. I can then pass the dictionary back to the caller.
How are you going to know, if the dictionary has 60 entries in it, which 30 you have already sent?
Doesn't the ForEach handle that for me?
Not if you are adding them to the dictionary, unless you are only adding them to the dictionary if they are sent successfully. What happens if there is an error in the transmission? Do you have to deal with that?
&gt; What happens if there is an error in the transmission? Nothing, really. The reply includes a reply type, and if there was Error or Failure, the reply is not processed. (That's from FedEx's sample code.) If so, the next batch should still go. If there is another issue, it will hopefully raise an error and be handled manually. The assumption is that not all packages will be delivered, so the same packages will be checked on more than one day. New day, new request, with some old tracking numbers and some new ones. The plan is to automate it, with some manual, on demand, checking. Btw, to repeat, i really appreciate you going through this with me. If i seem to know what i am talking about, don't be fooled. :)
lol no worries.
Something like this should work, I’m on mobile so excuse any typos. You need to specify what type of control it is with ctype: For each MyCtrl as control in me.controls Ctype(MyCtrl, textbox).text = “Something” Next You can change the control type to whatever control you are using but it will error if it finds a control that isn’t the one you have specified. So you can also check the control type first and then do whatever with it: If (MyCtrl.GetType() Is GetType(TextBox)) Then Ctype(MyCtrl, textbox).text = “something” Elseif (MyCtrl.GetType() Is GetType(Picturebox)) Then ‘Do something else End if Hope this is some help. Edit: Just re-read your question, I think what you’re looking for is just the ctype bit: Ctype(me.controls(“Name of control”), textbox).text = “something”
You need to cast the control object to the more specific type of control that it is to access properties that are unique to that control type. Otherwise you can only access properties of the control object which are the properties all controls have.
For what it's worth, I tend to use TypeOf instead of GetType... Is, because TypeOf works for inherited types, while GetType only works for exact matches.
A15 to J85, rows 15 to 85, so why is your loop going from 1 to 180 (or rather 6 to 185)? For i = 15 to 85 Range(Cells(i, 10).Add... ...
Because of the first few lines are text, should I isolate all the numbers in a sheet?
"retrieve it later" means what, exactly?
Sorry I'm making an automatic email and it allows me to enter the text or object(s) that appears in the email. I can get strings to appear in my email just by typing the name inside the quotations of the =strbody, how can I do the same for a list of values. All I have to do for strings is write their name. In other words: what object allows me to store a list of references strings and then print(I don't know the word) them all at once
loop over the cells and string concatenate.
Not entirely sure what that means. I'm talking more for example Dim NameList as list/string/(I don't know what goes here but that's what I'm asking) NameList = 'Cellrange' I just need a place to store a list of strings from a column. So that when I'm writing the email I just type 'NameList' and they insert themselves
&gt; Not entirely sure what that means. and google didn't help? honestly I'd have to google for an example, so you can too. try "loop over cells excel vba" and "vba string concatenate"
I might do this. Make a collection. Change the value of the tag to signify something about the control. add the controls you want directly into the collection. loop through the elements in the collection, and based off the tag, set the proper property. When I did this, I had five collections, one for each type of control (combobox, textbox. checkbox, etc) Having done this, the only time I got the error you mentioned was when I cheated and added a listbox to the combobox collection. Whoops, those two control types don't share all the same properties.
So far, what have you found, and what code do you currently have?
What you are seeing is a result of a thing called [Scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_\(computer_science\)). Since you are declaring the variable `TotalPoints` *within* the sub `cmdRoll_Click` that variable's value will be reinitialized every time that event is triggered. You'll need to declare `Dim TotalPoints As Long` outside of any subroutines/functions so that the variable is accessible to all subroutines in your form.
I've just just turned each cell into a an individual string then summoned it in the email E.g Dim Name1 as String Name1 = Cells(1, "A") Then typed this name into the strbody so that it appears in the email. ""name1 &amp; name2 &amp; name3" This works for me, but instead of choosing a range it means I have to add about 61 objects. All called Name.
Dim locationOfContentFound as inte Dim fileContents() as string = File.ReadAllText("PathToFile").Trim.Spllt(vbcrlf) For i = 0 to fileContents.Length - 1 if fileConents(i).Trim = "whatyouwanttofind" Exit For End If Next
File.ReadAllText, Split and a For Loop is all you need.
Alright thanks I’m gonna go check how the split works
Can you explain how to use the split in my scenario? Thanks in advance
Not gonna do your whole assignment for you. Coding is like Math, you learn it as you do it, as it helps you understand it better. Google and adding 'Stackoverflow' to any query will help immensely.
Ok I found out how to do it but it does the function slowly, any way how I can speed up the thread?
Post what you have.
Want me to pm you?
Just post the code here
Give me a second
pastebin.com/4U3hXqKe
In it's simplest form, you could do something like the following.. &amp;#x200B; `Private Names As New List(Of String)` `Private Sub test()` `For i As Integer = 1 To 61` `Names.Add(Cells(i, "A"))` `Next` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; However, if you're going to import more than just one column containing a name - e.g. each row contains the details of a person, you might want to consider creating a class called \`Person\` and reading the data from multiple columns into a List (Of Person) instead .. for example .. &amp;#x200B; `Friend Class Person` `Public Property FirstNames As String` `Public Property Surname As String` `Public Property DOB As Date` `Public Property AddressLine1 As String` &amp;#x200B; `End Class` &amp;#x200B; `Private People As New List(Of Person)` `Private Sub test()` `For i As Integer = 1 To 61` `Dim tempPerson As New Person` `tempPerson.FirstNames = Cells(i, "A")` `tempPerson.Surname = cells(i, "B")` `'and so on` `People.Add(tempPerson)` `Next` `End Sub`
No need to declare TotalPoints as long instead of integer - I doubt either competitor will reache Integer.Max :-)
Just for future reference - Professionals will frown at you for using `On Error Resume Next`. It's far better to use `Try..Catch..End Try`
Look up the System.IO.StreamReader, it will allow you to read a file a line at a time and do exactly what you're asking about.
You can use secureString to securely store the string in your code, or you could user Simple3DES and store an encrypted version of your string. I've used both to mall passwords but not the whole connection string. They would both work, though.
Don't. Not this way. Make a webservice/API to sit in the middle .NET being MS' Java is a bytecode that's easily decompiled into near-perfect source code (eg ILSpy)
Thank you - is creating a webservice/API something you do within Visual Studio or something that you setup server side with the hosted database?
How can I encrypt the string out of interest?
Here's a tutorial to do just that: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings)
Server side, and you *could* use visual studio for ASP or CGI web interface yes...
The only thing I noticed that may or may not be an issue, if your email column really called "EMail" or is it actually "Email"?
I'll double check but I'm sure I called it EMail
Spit out the var record after you set it. You may have a ' in name or something (O'Mally or something like that) that is breaking your statement. Side note you, shouldn't put text box strings directly in your SQL like that, you should use parameters. What if I put '; drop table email; in a text box? If it's for an assignment then it's probably fine, but those are best practices
I would print out the "Record" variable after you set it. Then see if there are quotes or single quotes in the values and if not attempt to do this query directly into SQL Server Manager to see if it works there.
I don't see any code validating and sanitizing your user input. you should look at what your `Record` string actually ends up containing and make sure it's valid SQL. you'll also want to do a little research on SQL injection to know how to handle this using Parameterization.
It worked! Thank you so much, Genuinely cannot see how come I couldn't figure it out to working but this actually fixed it, thank you so much.
So there are a bunch of things here: 1. You don't want to use ExecuteScalar for this as there is no result set returned from this sql statement (unless access is weird and returns you the new row you inserted). You want just the ExecuteNonQuery method. 2. Does it give you the error every time or just with specific data? 3. Does access require statements terminated with semi-colons? The examples I found online seem to have them. So try that. But its been more than a decade since I work with access. 4. The first thing I noticed is that you're not handling sql injection at all. So someone just using a single quote in the values is going to screw up your sql statement. Let alone something more nefarious. You might want to read up on parameterized sql statements. &amp;#x200B; You define one like this: Dim cmdTest As OleDbCommand cmdTest = New OleDBCommand("INSERT INTO Customers (Username, Password, Email, Mobile, Address) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", MyConnection) With cmdTest.Parameters .Add("@UserName", OleDbType.String, &lt;Field Length goes here&gt;).Value = txtUsername.Text etc End With
Password is a reserved keyword, you would need to escape it with [ ] "INSERT INTO Customers (Username, [Password], Email, Mobile, Address)...
that's not enough info to even know what book you have. there's a dozens of books about VB.
Can i take picture of the question
home work help here works better here if you type out what your questions about the exercise are, and post some kind of attempt. we're not doing it for you but will answer specific questions.
I posted up there u can see
No you created a completely new post with zero information, and just the picture. No one will know it is related to this post.
Yes, that is exercise 4. What about it?
I need help how to do it
Do your own homework. Show code and ask questions if you get stuck. This is how you learn.
You do realize that this group goes well beyond the scope of your class, yeah? &amp;#x200B; I mean, if you want I will write a solution for you, but it's going to be done in such a way you won't get any points for it. &amp;#x200B; If you've got specific questions as to how or why something works I'm sure most people here would be happy to help.
Dude you didn't even capture all the text of the question
Thanks for your response. I'll change to ExecuteNonQuery. It gives the error with all data. Access no longer requires semi colons to my knowledge (I have been using access scarcely for about 2 years). The program isn't being published to anyone so security is my last concern, and right now I would just like to get things working. Thank you again for such great help!
What’s even the question??
Its down exercise 4 you can see
A response to: [https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/bwdz3l/exercise\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/bwdz3l/exercise_4/) &amp;#x200B; So you want to get the code for checking if a value is too heavy or too large? First step would be to get the values from your text boxes, do you know how to do that? Also, hit the reply button to this post so that I can see that you respond.
Uhhhhhh. Unless I’m missing something on mobile.. I don’t see a question.
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/bwdz3l/exercise\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/bwdz3l/exercise_4/)
Ohhh ok thanks I didn’t see that. Sounds pretty simple to me? OP just needs to check the weights and volume on the button click. Not even sure how to help other than write the solution lol.
Yeah, I don't think the poor person gets Reddit. That feeling you get in school when you finally figure out a question you've been struggling with is amazing, so I'd love to help them out, but there isn't enough clarity in what they're asking to actually help.
I think he just wants to know how to write basic if statements?
or how to access the text property of the textbox control. or how to treat that value as an integer. or how to calculate volume of an object. or the meaning of life. &amp;#x200B; I don't know where this person is skill wise (I assume he's just learning the basics now), so it is a bit hard to tell how much detail needs to be given.
No i dont know
I would suggest you start with Googling that for more detail, but you can get the values from a textbox by doing something like this Dim strVariable as String = [textboxName].Text
Do you know what is chapter 4 question its something from the exercises
It looks like what you're trying to do is this: &amp;#x200B; 1) Collect the weight and dimensions of an object from the user 2) Use the dimensions of the object to calculate its volume 3) Compare that volume and weight against maximum acceptable values 4) If the volume or weight are above the maximum acceptable values warn the user, if not let the user know that everything is okay. Outside of the picture you posted, I really have no idea what your assignment is.
No there is test on chapter 4 it will be something from exersice the question of the test
This question or something similar will probably be on the test.
Jesus you are so lazy. Do your own fucking homework.
I dont know how
Nice catch! This is certainly the primary issue. Find the list of reserved words [here](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/learn-about-access-reserved-words-and-symbols-ae9d9ada-3255-4b12-91a9-f855bdd9c5a2).
Then start with chapter 1 again. Maybe chapter 4 is too much for you.

Use threading.
I'm cool with helping with obvious schoolwork but the lack of effort is mind blowing. Go back in your book and read it again. Or ask to have someone better explain something you don't understand. Or Google a little bit. Geez.
Have a look at this question on msdn - [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/95eacab3-1892-49b9-ad36-6cdc59ecec64/play-multiple-sound-clips-simultaneously?forum=vblanguage](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/95eacab3-1892-49b9-ad36-6cdc59ecec64/play-multiple-sound-clips-simultaneously?forum=vblanguage)
I actually tried that method, for whatever reason it wouldn’t work though. Thanks anyway.
If you need anymore info on the code, lmk :)
Off topic. Do a favor to yourself and use camel or pascal case to name your subs and functions. Not mandatory but it makes your code more readable. See more information here [Microsoft Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-type-members)
Did you set a break point on the sub so you can step through and see exactly which line crashes so you can observe the variable values and see what array object is being accessed out of bounds?
You should be able to make a normal web request using VB to make the page respond as if you're requesting it in a browser. This can get tricky as automatically downloading html usually means you're trying to do something nefarious. What's your use case for this?
&gt;normal web request using VB to make the page respond as if you're requesting it in a browser. Obviously, I've been doing this wrong. How does one make a request that will activate response to Ajax? &gt; automatically downloading html usually means you're trying to do something nefarious Heh. I understand that impression. I'm not even using it to download porn. No, I am deeply involved with travel and do like to follow multiple sites for information and rates in order to keep a database and to make summaries. I can keep much better track of fares and prices this way. For example, Delta has a page where they show their best bargain Skymiles fares, but it is populated through Ajax. I would love to be able to include this in my data.
If you're looking for pricing info and what not, scraping html is going to be a bad way to do things because as soon as they make changes your scraper will either get bad info, get no info, or flat out break. You're probably better off looking for free APIs out there that serve up this info. That being said, if you REALLY want to parse html, then just google visual basic download html from web page. There are plenty of easy options out there
I can download the HTML and parse without problem. Been doing that a long time. The problem is with the dynamic content that is not downloaded with the HTML file. &gt;because as soon as they make changes your scraper will either get bad info Quite true. When they change format I need to retool, but fortunately I've developed pretty good tools for parsing the pages and that only takes minutes to change, provided they have not moved to dynamic content.
The highlighted code looks like this: [Error Image](https://imgur.com/a/L8HzZxj) I just can’t seem to find the problem with my block of code. I appreciate you trying to help.

whatever the value of length is there, it is beyond the bounds of the snake() array. For example if your snake array has 5 elements (0,1,2,3,4) and you try to access element 5, you get indexoutofrangeexception because there is no element 5 only 0-4. So since this looks to be code where you are making the snake longer, you likely need to redim your array to increase the number of elements in it. Redim with the preserve keyword will change the size of the array while keeping the existing elements intact. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement
My snake array has 1001 elements because I did: Dim snake(1000) As PictureBox The lengthensnake() array has no boundaries. Sorry I’m new to this 😬
Well what is the value of your length variable when you get to that line of code and it throws the exception?
Just figured it out! I needed to add 2 lengthensnake() under the head sun rather than the lengthensnake() sub. Appreciate your help and time friend 🙌🏽
No, Visual Basic is incompatible with the internet.
it's just text. copy/paste code snips all you like. if you want to share the whole project/solution, do a build/clean and zip up the folder, or use git and upload to one of the various online git services, just make sure you setup your .ignore file correctly before committing any files.
You can paste whatever code you want. Projects you may need to zip, and possibly even change the extension. You can alternative use paste bin if you want. Lastly, if it is a project, you can create a git hub repo and only share it with people you want to.
That's just mean.
You can export VBA modules as a separate file. It’s a nice way to keep a library of code that gets used often.
Does CR support printing directly without a dialog?
no, you'd need to make an HTA dialog for that
How straight forward is it to make an HTA dialog u/chrwei?
I haven't even tried in 15+ years. I'm sure there guides for it.
Ok I'll take a look, I'm new to VB.
just make sure you put "vbs" or "vbscript" in your searches, not just "vb". there's basically 4 kinds of VB, and they are not really very compatible.
A message box is a model window and as you have seen it stops the code until it is processed. Just like
this won't fully answer your question, but i hope will help you discover code 'ways' for vba/vbs. Just record a macro in MSoffice. then hit f11. you can copy-paste that code. modify it etc. it can REALLY help and speed things up. I'm sorry to anybody that feels this is downvote worthy. i just wanted to share a tip that might be helpful here.

How about the tab.Visible property?
You can use a second tab control that's not visible and then transfer the tab back and forth between the visible and hidden tab controls.
VB 2017 doesn't have this property
After playing with this over the weekend here is my solution. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `' remove the Sensor tab` `Dim numTabs As Integer = TabControl.TabCount` `If (numTabs = 5) Then` `TabControl.TabPages.Remove(TAB_Sensor)` `End If` Don't really need the numTabs variable. When removing a tab probably do not need to check the number of tabs. &amp;#x200B; `'bring back the Sensor tab` `Dim numTabs As Integer = TabControl.TabCount` `If (numTabs &lt; 5) Then` `TabControl.TabPages.Insert(3, TAB_Sensor)` `End If` This works when the tab is present at the start. When a tab is removed its properties/contents are remembered so can be brought back. If you insert a tab from new it will be blank. If you do not include a tab count check it is possible to keep adding new tabs.
Ah yes, just done a bit more googling in msdn. It seems the only way is to remove the tab.
Sorry, I cant seem to format the cURL properly with line breaks.
use the WebClient object. you have 2 parts to that, one is to add an extra HTTP header called Authorization, and the other is to POST json data. there should be many examples of both.
This is a POST request for the random.org API. I cheaped out on JSON handling and did something fragile since I only needed one number out of the output: https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/HAController/blob/master/modRandom.vb#L29 And this code adds an authorization header to the request, but is a little less similar overall: https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/SSCaaS/blob/master/SSCaaS.vb#L35 Remember that JSON is just a block of formatted text, so you have two separate steps here: 1. Making the web request and retrieving the result, which you should be able to display the text output of the JSON from to verify you are getting what you expect. 2. Feeding that JSON into code or a library to parse it and get out the information you want.
there's 2 options to this. your first option, if possible, is to change the app so to does not need to write to the program files directory. use `Application.CommonAppDataPath` or `Application.UserAppDataPath` if that's really not an option, you need to use your installer's scripting or customization options to set these default permission on install, not as part of your app.
Applications are not supposed to write data to the "Program Files" folder, the allowed location is the "ProgramData" folder (no space between words) Take a peek at this page for some info on Common Folders: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/895723/environment-getfolderpath-commonapplicationdata-is-still-returning-c-docum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/895723/environment-getfolderpath-commonapplicationdata-is-still-returning-c-docum)
Thanks for the reply Chrwei. In your opinion, what is the most sensible place to have an application install if it is not in the program files directory? My second question is how I go about changing the default location. I can do this in the properties of the installer. The current value is: '[ProgramFilesFolder][Manufacturer]\[ProductName]' This syntax is different from anything else I have done in VB.NET and I'm not sure I understand how to change it.
Thanks for the reply. My C:\ does not have a ProgramData folder by default. Should I just have one created by the installer?
Scratch that, it was hidden -_- Sorry
I had the program installed to the ProgramData folder. I get the same error that I do not have permissions to run the code from the screenshot.
The PROGRAM goes in the Program Files folder, the data the program uses goes in the ProgramData folder. Let us know EXACTLY what line the code errors on, and the exact error it gives.
you read that wrong. the application installs in program files. the DATA files the app needs go in the various data folders, depending on how the data is used.
Thanks. I think i can work with what I've learned. Out of curiosity, what would the harm be if I installed the entire project under the ProgramData folder?
No issues that I can think of... however, developers should not force the installation location. The reason for "Program Files" is that the OS has control over it. An end-user they can affect things they should not (ie: deleting data and/or application. By using standard practices you can avoid these sorts of issues. By placing the app in "Program Files" an end-user who does not have Admin rights (which in corp world they should not have admin) so they cannot adversely affect the app. This helps avoid support issues. This is one of the jobs of a developer. Writing code is only part of the job.
Thanks. I'm all set, have a great day.
Thanks for the help. I have what I need now.
This is what I use Dim contentType As String = "application/json" Dim msg As HttpResponseMessage Dim apiToken = "SomeTokenHere" 'set this to data if you want to post to the url. It's more than likely the json you want to send Dim postData = "" Dim enc = Encoding.UTF8 Dim url = "http://TheUrlYouWantToHit.com" Try Using client As HttpClient = New HttpClient() client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Bearer " &amp; apiToken) If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(postData) Then msg = client.PostAsync(url, New StringContent(postData, enc, contentType)).Result Else msg = client.GetAsync(url).Result End If End Using Catch ex As Exception 'some error happened, maybe the site is down? End Try If (msg.IsSuccessStatusCode) Then Dim response = msg.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result Else 'didn't get a success code back, error handle End If
I had the same issue a while back for an app I was working on, I did find a solution though playing around with different IO classes. You’ll need to change the permissions on the folder, I’ve seen some software do this as well. If you’re planning on storing user defined files like config files, log files, etc, it’s best policy to store them in AppData as Microsoft recommends. If I can find my old source code I’ll link it here.
I made this, might help: https://github.com/dg107/GenericRest a VB library to do most rest stuff without much thought. Just create an object that is what the service returns or expects and pass that object in.
The application needs to run as an administrator to make changes there. However that folder is not supposed you be used like that. You should be storing and editing does in ProgramData if system-wide, or AppData if user-specific. What you're doing is not good practice.
No. You’ll have to create your own function or continue splitting the string and appending the results to a list.
Dammit. Thanks for helping me out
Split string doesn’t allow formatting for multiple delimiters and for future reference, you can tell what a function or method supports by seeing if it’s overloaded or not, and seeing what parameters there are in overloads. You can also look at the API either through VS, MS, or MSDN, and see each of the overloads and their purpose as well for complete documentation in using followed with examples. It’s best practice to look at the API before consulting Reddit or other people as it makes it look like you are lazy, not really interested in learning and just doing it to pass a class, or you expect everyone to write it for you. If you check the API and your answer is not there, it’s because the feature doesn’t exist. Now is the time to start investing in 3rd party libraries by using Google and or GitHub. Or you can roll your own as a learning project and release it, that way when someone asks the same question, you can have a talk with him like I did with you. Welcome to programming.
Are you talking about doing something like this?: Dim input As String = "This, is going to be; a very wierd sentence. Don't you think?" Dim result As String() = input.Split(New [Char]() {CChar(" "), CChar(","), CChar(";"), CChar("."), CChar("?")}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) For Each r As String In result Console.WriteLine(r) Next Console.ReadLine()
Yea you can't do multiple in one, you'd likely need to split your splits :). If you can post some data as an example and what you're trying to accomplish, I could offer some suggestions.
The easiest way is to replace each split character with itself plus '|' (or any other character not likely to appear) and the split using the '|' character. You also get to keep your full spots, commas etc. &amp;#x200B; for example the op post would become &amp;#x200B; This is for a school project that requires we make a cloze passage generator.| I'm trying to make code that splits a big paragraph into smaller strings of different words by using the split function.| It works great,| until there are multiple bits of grammar to factor in.| Is there a way to use multiple delimiters?| Also how would you then display the contents of the array in a textbox.| Thank you!| &amp;#x200B; psudo code &amp;#x200B; replace(PARAGRAPH, ".", ".|") replace(PARAGRAPH, ",", ",|") replace(PARAGRAPH, "?", "?|") LINES() = split(PARAGRAPH, "|") for each LINE in LINES replace(LINE, "|", "") next
Are you sure this is for Visual Basic? Usually gaming projects are built on C or C++ or a variant of. Also, try reposting the question with a title that asks the question, rather than "help needed", and post some code to show us what you've tried so far.
I've only been coding since the start of the semester of grade 10, and basically all I've learned is visual basics. Right now all i have is "Mario" to move and climb up ladders, and i have no clue what so ever on jumping or physics in general. But ill repost with a better title.
So what program are you using to compile your code my dude? Do you have a snippet of any code you've written so far so I can just check it's definitely VB and see if we can help?
The easiest way is to take the starting position of the sprite and calculate an arc for the character to traverse given the length from the starting position to the landing position. This is trigonometry and you may need to consult your math teacher. Here are some resources. https://www.themathpage.com/aTrig/arc-length.htm https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/sat-math-practice/new-sat-additional-topics-math/v/sat-math-s4-easier This arc is calculated real time and sets the position of the character based upon the game "clock"
All you need to do is use the sheets collection that is built into excel. Something like this should do it. Dim ws as worksheet Dim Oldname as string For Each ws in sheets Oldname = ws.name Ws.name = mid(oldname,1,8) &amp; "19" Next ws I am on mobile so I might has messed up some syntax (and haven't been able to test it)
Hey! I'm working in a new project 100% compatible with VB6: RAD Basic. 100% compatible, with no migration. Open your VB6 project in the new IDE and continue working. Please, check it out at: [https://www.radbasic.dev/](https://www.radbasic.dev/)
Here you go OP: Option Explicit Public Sub RenameWorksheets() Call ConvertYears(2019) End Sub Public Function ConvertYears(ByVal YearVal As Long) Dim TSheet As Worksheet For Each TSheet In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets Dim TempDate As Date: TempDate = DateValue(TSheet.Name) If TempDate &gt; 0 Then TSheet.Name = Format(TempDate, "mm-dd-") &amp; CStr(YearVal) ConvertYears = True End If Next TSheet Set TSheet = Nothing End Function ---- Very rudimentary code with zero error checking, but it does the job fine if the naming scheme is exactly as you have shown as an example.
Just go through the code in your head, follow what happens to myArray
That's the thing, whenever I read through the text I can't see what I'm doing wrong as I can't see any errors
So in your code you: - create a variable called X you give it a value of 0 then you redim your array myArray with X... which is 0 &amp;#x200B; so you have an array that has no entries.
But haven't I already done that via this code? Dim x As Integer x = 0 My problem is that it gives me an invalid compiler for MyArray Or at least current problem lol
This code, if you get it working is going to make things confusing as it will keep adding the contents of the array to the listbox. For example, if you were to type "able" in the textbox and click the button it would put "able" into the listbox. If you then type "baker" and click the button you would then have "able" "able" "baker" in your listbox. Now the reason I say **if** you get it working is because you are 1. Not preserving the array on the redim, and 2. You are not incrementing x so that the array can be redim'd to store more. Here is a link to a [guide for using Arrays in VBA](https://excelmacromastery.com/excel-vba-array/) that might help you. Here is how I would go about doing what you appear to be doing. Declare your x variable (outside the sub to widen the scope) Declare your myArray() (outside the sub to widen the scope) Create your CmdAdd_Click() sub Redim Preserve your array to x elements store the content of the textbox into the array at element x increment x clear the textbox for the next entry Now at this point you should have a method to add items to the array. Notice we have not done anything with the listbox. Now you have a couple of choices. You can then (inside the button) clear the listbox and create a loop to fill it with the contents of the array (hint: use something other than x so as not to mess up the value of your current element number) Or create another button to fill the contents of the listbox to show that your array does indeed hold the values you entered. Now it's been a while since I have used VBA but on that link I gave you they are showing you a couple of different methods of looping through the array, try one of these (myself, I prefer the `for each` method.)
Thats the problem you don't want an array with 0 entries, you want one with 5.
you seem to be on the right track, but why are you putting the password in the lastname parameter? and instead of just getting the count, maybe you want to select from fields and check the resultset? or do you not understand the code you posted at all?
nope I barely understand it, it ain’t mine, I started vb a few days ago and i got to make a lil game from scratch but never worked with a database, got a access database to work with but I didn’t make it, and since i dont want to screw anything up im saving the pass in lastname
I'd recommend finding a guide on using OleDb then. reusing code without understanding it is a good way to "screw things up", as you put it. a basic understanding of SQL will help too, if you're going to keep using an SQL based storage system. also, what you're doing there is fine for a personal learning project, just know that storing the password as plain text like that is a pretty glaring security issue. best practice is to use a salted password hash.
also what im trying to do is something like if score.Text 'a var that has the score of the game' &gt; (here is where the companyName value comes into play) then replace the companyName value with score.Text which i think ik how to do &amp;#x200B; any recommendations would be welcomed
Thank you!

Workbook is an Excel objection, you need to switch it for whatever the autodesk equivalent is
College entrance exams sure have changed since my day, I don’t remember it hinging on my VB knowledge.
If you have a git hub repo you can post it and I'll take a look
I hate when people say they have no clue what they are doing on a *final*. Unless your teacher is a total shit show, you should have a clue. With that said, I am always willing to help (when I can) but you provided 0 info on what you have attempted. No one will do your project for you. Show some effort or find someone you can hire to do this. It probably wont be anyone on this sub tho.
If it's due tomorrow, and you really didn't put in the effort to learn in time, then you are going to learn a very valuable lesson.
I won’t write the code for you. But do a random number generator that selects between zero and two and whatever it selects point to that object in the array.
Agreed. OP needs to share their github repo for this !
 Dim rnd as new Random Dim output as string output = nameArray(rnd.next(0,4))
what exactly is "a debug issue"? an error message? that error detail will usually give a clue to what's wrong.
Correct, I got an error message, but all it was was the one line of code highlighted. As I said in my post, it worked fine on my computer so I'm not sure why it isn't working on someone else's.
without an error message I'm not sure we can't help. typically you get an error AND it highlights. highlight without an error doesn't really make sense.
well, an Excel Range ins't an array of datagridviewrow, so yeah. can't do that. loop tho range and create rows. Or open it as oledb and set datasources as needed.
Can you suggest a different code?
are you sure the header you're adding is in the right format?
I'm not at all clear on what you're doing, and I don't really do VBA anyway. just without the error message I don't think anyone can help you.
Have you gotten this to work in just a rest client of some sort. That's usually my first step in connecting to any API, is to get it working manually. A lot of times, it can just be little nuances, and if you have the rest client, you can send them a screen shot and they can see. Just a guess but it might be in the Auth part. It looks like you're sending a JWT? If so, I don't think that is a valid one
Your example doesn't make sense, can you just explain in basic terms what problem you're trying to solve?
You can't add a range to the gridview. You would need to create a new datagridrow, set each column to the corresponding value in excel, and then add it. However, this may be easier by setting up a connection string to the sheet. What are you doing this in? Win Forms, WPF, etc.
probably doesnt make sense because i wrote it in english not in vb, try to read it as a person would and maybe you will understand, if you dont i will try to explain it better
What's the error you get?
wait nvm read it again and your right it doesnt
I did try to read it. If you post your code that might help.
i dont really have any code for the example im giving since i dont even know how to start, all i have is a login form, in another form i want to check if the values of one of the columns (values) in the row that the FirstName and SecondName are equal to those of the person thats logged in (I have the first and second name saved ) is bigger than a variable, if it is then replace the value by the variable, and else dont do anything
i cant find any good guide on working with databases for this example so thats why im asking here
It doesn't seem all that complicated, I'm just trying to create a form where content controls display when the document is opened and do not print when the form is printed. This is the error: "Run-time error '4605': The ShowHiddenText method or property is not available because this command is not available for reading."
I'm not sure, I'm new to both VB and Rest API's. I just googled for other ways to format the header and I tried myReq.Headers("Authorization") = "Bearer " &amp; apiKey Are there other formats I should try?
[removed]
Run-time error '438': Object doesnt support this property or method
I mean, is the format and content of that key correct? you're not giving any context here.
&gt; "Run-time error '4605': google results say the document isn't open? maybe it's i process of opening at that point and not yet fully open? is there another event you can use for when it's finished opening? like I said, I don't do VBA.
what's failing you about the guides you find?
most of them are to complex for my experience with vb, i have been using vb for about 3 days so im not really familiarized with most of the concepts.
then maybe take a step back and work on that foundation first.
yeah Im thinking about doing that but idk what to do, Im working on a little game project im doing, i dont know what else to add to the game so im starting to learn to use databases
Ah, to show you how new I am, i do not have a github repo. I'll do it now.
set a breakpoint and step though to find what part isn't working like you want. I don't see an issue, but I don't know what your data look like either.
That's totally fine dude. It would be a good idea to start one to track your changes. You'd be surprised at how being able to go back and look at changes is really useful.
&gt; Object doesnt support this property or method That's saying that whatever method you're calling where it fails doesn't exist.
Set one, and it steps through and it goes to the else statement, but just doesn't show the messagebox for some reason. i even changed it to [messagebox.show](https://messagebox.show) just to see if that made a difference, but no
are on the same network or all remote? on the network, you can use a local database. for remote, if they can use a VPN, you can still use a database. if a VPN isn't an option, you need to host a server somewhere and make an API, which is fairly advanced
I've never had that happen. weird.
I posted one chunk to this sub a few minutes ago about a function that is part of my project. could you look at it, its not working properly? basically i need to check the db to see if certain criteria are met. i'm using a reader, maybe scalar is better? idk, its going through the motions but the messagebox isnt showing even though it goes to the else statement.
Isn't it MessageBox.Show("Your message here.")?
I answered there, if you have a way to share your code, I can take a look but it looks like you're doing a lot right. You could definitely benefit from an ORM like linq to sql or entity framework. It makes working with databases a lot easier. [Here's a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/bxwv2k/noob_learning_to_connect_c_and_sql_on_vs2019/eqajf10/) I wrote about it. It's in c# but you should be able to read it and see the assimilates. One thing, even if you don't do the linq to sql or EF, always do any sort of db connection in a using statement. I.e. Using conn = new SqlConnection(connString) conn.open() dim cmd = new SqlCommand(someSql, conn) dim reader = cmd.executereader() while reader.read() 'do stuff end while conn.close() End Using
Just toss the d/b up on Google or AWS. If it’s sensitive I’d do a web ap with all the fancy security crap.
Add steps to write to console to see what you get there. I've had msgbox events misfire and been able to diagnose by using verbose logging to console or a text file.

Thanks for this...I've disabled offline files and still getting same error.
VS. either leave it running in debug and take memory use snapshot to inspect, or deploy a debug compiled version to some test subjects and use the remote debugger tool to do the same.
Visual studio has a built in memory analyzer I believe, if you're running in debug mode
Late reply but yeah i had already watch that series back then, still got no clue how to do what Im trying to
I think it's great to see people proudly making games in VB. :) Honestly probably the only thing you might be short of compared to any other similar Steam title is a more custom UI. But plenty of these type of games are straight HTML with nothing fancy either.

There isn't a shortcut to focus on the first control, That I'm aware of. &amp;#x200B; Probably the easiest way to do this would be to listen for a keypress then focus it on the text (or whatever control) you're trying to focus. &amp;#x200B; Here's an example how I'd do it: &amp;#x200B; 1. 3 textboxes (text1, text2 and text3) 2. 1 timer (interval set at 30, enabled) &amp;#x200B; Add a module and add this : `Public Declare Function GetAsyncKeyState Lib "user32" (ByVal vKey As Long) As Integer` &amp;#x200B; Now, back to the form: `Private Sub Timer1_Timer()` `On Error Resume Next` `'Set focus when CTRL key is pressed.` `If GetAsyncKeyState(17) Then` `Text2.SetFocus` `End If` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps.
Wait, so this is made in WinForms?!
Thanks to both of you--you're right, and feel like an idiot. When we dug a little deeper the memory analysis tools in VS are actually pretty good, and should do what we need. &amp;#x200B; Thank you for your input!
Nice!
If I had to guess, it sounds like they are using an app to automate filling in an external form, likely a web based one using the browser control, not a VB6 form. Otherwise it would be pretty straight forward to focus on the lowest tab order control in the VB form.
 GetNextControl(ctrl, true) This will proceed through all the controls, then you can test the tabindex of the control with focus using ActiveControl of the form or container. CurrentTabIndex may work also, depending on your container control.
Yup!
to focus on any given field use {controlname}.setfocus()
Yes! The label you have captioning the field must have the tab index prior to the textbox. Then assign a letter to be your hotkey by prefixing it with an ampersand `&amp;`. Thus your shortcut to the text box will be Alt+Hotletter Example: Label1 with caption `&amp;Field 1` displays just "Field 1" with the "F" underlined and no ampersand (your visual cue for what the hotkey is). Label1's Tabindex is 2. Textbox for it's TabIndex is 3 Pressing Alt+F will give focus to TextBox1 The label must be visible=true. The label does not have to be near the textbox, it may be "hidden" being positioned off the form
You can, as you have been able to since forever, set an underscored letter in a control's caption and use ALT-&lt;letter&gt; to select it.
Why do this instead of just using the key events?
make a new project of the type you want it to be (console, wpf, winform, service, library, etc). what shows is dependent on the project type. there are hacky ways around that, but it's better to do it the RightWay
I can try, assuming it works as well as the sample code. In any case, which project type is best? There's no need for any visible output.
No visible output? Service
And that will run as a regular .exe? I mean, from the command line and stop when it is done. (I am getting confused by the term Service, as in Windows Services.)
so you just want to manually run it and it does a thing with no indication to the user that anything happened at all? seems like asking for trouble, but you can do it with a regular windows app and exit the application in the form_load. you should do error handling and DO show the form with the error messages and retry options if it doesn't run as expected. if it's going to run via a scheduled job, a console app will work fine, jobs don't run in a gui context. if it's run from another program, you can use `Process` and `ProcessStartInfo` to hide the window.
It looks like it will be run from an Access program, though personally, i think they should run it on a schedule.
I think VBA's shell command has an option to hide too. make then use it. hiding your interface at best is really annoying, and can cause you lots of headaches if something goes wrong.
Excellent point. Thank you.
True, this would work better. I just immediately thought of doing it the other way. &amp;#x200B; I was thinking more of it working even if the form isn't active but I suppose that's not needed here.
What do you mean by sql file? Are you trying to read data from a database into a win forms project or something?
Not familiar with SQLyog but according to a user on D.I.C it’s not a DB or a server but instead it’s a database manager. You’ll need to use MySQL &amp; not SQLyog or something. Again not familiar. I’m only quoting someone else here. (Source) https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/188182-vb-6o-sqlyog/
you can loop the datatable and add each item to the array or use linq's Select(...).ToArray() syntax
I am not familiar with linq. I was trying to find ToArray everywhere but no dice. So far, what i found works is: Dim Data_Adapter As New xxxDataSetTableAdapters.yyyTableAdapter Dim List As New ArrayList For Each row As xxxDataSet.yyyRow In Data_Adapter.GetData List.Add(row.TrackingNum) Next Tracking_Id_List = Get_Delivered_Times(CType(List.ToArray(GetType(String)), String())) That works, but seems unnecessary.
"named arguments" is the technique you're looking for.
I tried naming the arguments, but it then tells me it is not one of the overloads. My.Computer.Network.DownloadFile(address:="", destinationFileName:="", overwrite:=True) redlines DownloadFile and give me an "Overload resolution failed because there is no accessible 'DownloadFile' accepts this number of arguments.
Just use ,,, not ,"","" your filling in the parameters
In this last example, i used quotes to signify i had added a text there. Regardless, since it expected text, the compiler doesn't care about it being empty or not.
idk, maybe it only works on vb native functions
Thanks for looking though. Your a big help.
exactly
Look into a SQL data reader. You can't directly connect a file but you can execute the SQL inside the file with code
well, you're there.. it works. so how can we shorten it? simple. use WITH ..code.. With Network.Downloadfile .url = "url here" .destination ="dest path" .overwrite ="true" End With ..code.. you may need to meddle with the formatting as i cant test right now. but thats how you do it
see my answer (WITH)
Really? A WITH can handle parameters? Hmm... i guess i saw that with some other calls when the parameters where in braces. &gt;well, you're there.. it works. Actually, it kept timing out for some reason. Maybe it was the username and password? No idea. So i went back without the overwrite to make it work, so i just pass the two parameters: url and filename. I'd like overwrite to work so if the code is rerun on the same ids there will be no error, and this seemed like the easiest way to do it. (Furthermore, in some cases it is possible the file has been updated, which while unneeded, it might be nice to have the newer version.) I'm going to have to try this when i go back on Monday. Thank you.
yes. with can do it. in fact thats what its for. its all right having commas etc, but hard to know the order. so having the **.name** really helps understand the code when reading back in a few months lol and after doing the with &lt;.method&gt; you just need to type a . (dot) and immediately have the intellisense list of available parameters for that particular method.
Well, i knew WITH could be used to set properties, that's old hat, and in the past, i've used it plenty. What i didn't know was that it could also be used to set parameters of a function call. That's fascinating, and i can't wait to try it out.
try catch throw end catch is useful, but tiny code blocks like that just dont make it worth it. do come back after the problem you posted is solved ,or not, (and how you solved as other readers can benefit), but also anything else you want to discuss. timing out issue is intriguing. but i dont want to postulate as it will just muddy the waters. one solution at a time at a time :)
yes. sorry if i may have come across as condescending. apologies.
np. I just want you to know i'm not a *total* idiot. :)
then we are DEFINITELY well matched equals because i'm not a *total* pro. :) good luck with the project fren :)
thanks ill try looking into it
Maybe use a List of String instead of an ArrayList. Dim StringList as List(of Sting) It supports StringList.ToArray
Create a console application. Do not output anything to the console (no console.write's or writelines, etc...). Test your application. Open Project|Properties and change Application type to Windows Forms Application with the startup object being your Module name that was created. I just tested this with the following code Module Module1 Sub Main() System.IO.File.Create("D:\ATestFile.txt") End Sub End Module By setting the application type to Windows Forms Application and ensuring that the startup object was Module1 I placed the exe onto the desktop, double clicked it and without any indication of anything happening, the textfile appeared in my D:\ .
If you have control of `Tracking_Function`, refactor it to operate on a single `TrackingNum`. From there, you can do all of your work in the `ForEach` loop. This way you don't need LINQ, you can skip the conversion to an array, and you loop over you data exactly 1 time. I would avoid `ArrayList` like the plague (not to mention it's [recommended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.arraylist?view=netframework-4.8#remarks) by Microsoft too).
Another simple technique is instead of passing individual parameters, you could put all the parameters into a class as properties and then just pass a reference to the class ... fill whatever properties you like leave the rest blank or defaulted to some value. Lots of ways to skin the cat! &amp;#x200B; \- Karlton
Good idea. In this case, it's one line of code though, so i don't want to put too much into it.
This site should have what you need. [https://www.connectionstrings.com/](https://www.connectionstrings.com/)
Look into using XML
The last paragraph has me super confused
Sorry I didn't notice the typo Basically what I have now is a list of what Information is on what line of the save file; so I need to make sure when I read it that, for example, line 189 is read for the 189th variables; if it reads 188 or 190 the wrong data will go to the wrong variable
Second this. Parsing an XML document is crazy fast and the code is so elegant.
use structured data. xml, yaml, json, probably more. you could also use a database.
Json, xml, or a database. If you can post the structure of your data I can help more
thanks a lot
The DownloadFile is still redlined telling me there are no overloads for it. I do not think the WITH is working as you have explained it.
&gt; refactor it to operate on a single TrackingNum I specifically wrote it to work on an array to take advantage of the ability to send 30 ids in a shot. The function accepts any amount of ids, splits them into sets of 30, and returns all the replies together. &gt;I would avoid ArrayList like the plague (not to mention it's recommended by Microsoft too). Thank you for that. I am changing it right now.
first, use parameter binding, you have an sql injection exploit there. https://www.access-programmers.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=219149 ADO is nice because on the VB side it doesn't matter what the database is, the code is pretty much the same. the connection string and sometimes the SQL commands need changed for different databases. pretty much any vb6 ADO guide will get you where you need to be.
Good idea. Thank you. I am changing it to that right now. Um, *New* List. :)
Can you pls screenshot your code including any declarations and imports and post pls?
Created a new Solution/Project, vb, .net, windows, console, tested the one-line, worked including saving the file. Tested the WITH, redlined. [Screenshot](https://ibb.co/sb52XVc) Code: Module Module1 Sub Main() ' Tested My.Computer.Network.DownloadFile("http://example.com/index.html", "c:\a\index.html") ' Redlined With My.Computer.Network.DownloadFile .address = "http://example.com/index.html" .destinationFileName = "c:\a\index.html" End With End Sub End Module
The ugly black window is gone. O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! Thank you. :)
i'm just installing the ide. can you put WITH on it's own line and test. it doesn't 'feel' right to look at. also, what's the message when hovering on the red squiggle? (lawd, vb takes ages to install these days! lol)
I don't like the new keyword in my declarations, I prefer all my Dims look the same. So I would do: Dim StringArray as List (Of String) = New List(Of String)
Fair enough.
Well i openly and completely accept i have made a mistake. **I AM A KNOB** I really thought WITH could be used with any method. but if nothing else, i'm going to keep on and find a way as you've set a challenge. I'm sorry if i wasted you time.
&gt; i'm going to keep on and find a way as you've set a challenge. That's the spirit! :) Btw, what type of knob exactly?
what's the most repulsive and and disgusting and useless knob you can think of? Well he's 2 levels above me.
Hmm.. howsabout those useless crosswalk buttons? They're repulsive because they have strong springs, disgusting, because everyone touches them, and useless, because they rarely do anything anyway. :) Thanx though. Because you got me to test that, i just got past a second issue by testing it with a clean file until i realized my (stupid) mistake).
onwards! i dont press the button cos i know despite me standing there, there will always somebody that comes along and press the button anyway. and if they dont, i'll wait for a gap or for the lights to change anyway lol :) Also.. ONWARDS!!! :)
PartID is not a valid column name.
One of the columns in the database is named PartID, so shouldn't it just fetch the data from there?
Are you sure it's PartID and not PartId or partID or something? Make sure the case is identical.
I'll have to triple check but I'm very sure yes.
I am not familiar with data readers, but i would like to make a few comments about the code. 1) Do not use SELECT * outside of an EXISTS() and ad-hoc queries. It causes a dictionary lookup, all the data in the record to be sent (over the network), and can cause ordering issues if more than one column is retrieved. Specifying the column names in the query is also self-documenting. 2) Do not use dynamic SQL. It is inefficient and insecure. Use host variables. 3) Read rule 2 again, and never ever break it. 4) You are running the same query over and over again. The IF statement should include only the query, and instead use one common MyDataReader and While block. 5) Read rule 2 a few more times.
What was rule 2 again? :P
Have you validated that there is a set of data in the datareader?
When I run the same SQL command in access, it retrieves the correct data. Therefore, the command should run correctly in the code aswell and retrieve also the correct data.
Heh. As a database guy i can't let it go. Also, as many news stories have shown, [little bobby tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) has a high cost. If you do not use dynamic SQL, it is nigh-impossible for that to happen.
thanks for the update. interesting reading. :)
Try MyDataReader.GetString("PartID")
I understand when you run this in access that it is working as expected. A lot of time this error comes when there is no data in the datareader object. thus the "indexoutofrange" try this If (DataReader.IsDBNull("PartID")) Then msgbox("Error PartID is null") end if
This is 100% true, all the fields you full from the database are either in the order of the SELECT part of your statement, or by the order they are in the database design view itself if you use \*, and they are numbered from 0-10, or however many items are in your SELECT, so if "PartID' was one of the items, then you would put: CPUID = MyDataReader.item(0).tostring
All the fields you pull from the database are either in the order of the SELECT part of your statement, or by the order they are in the database design view itself if you use \*, and they are numbered from 0-10, or however many items are in your SELECT, so if "PartID' was the 4th item, then you would put: CPUID = MyDataReader.item(3).ToString
from my understanding, which is a little limited, you're trying to store the message box in a variable, when the message box is a function, so it should look something like this. `Else` `wscript.sleep 6000` `MsgBox("Check" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error")`
u/prestonelam2003, that is an example of trying to get the pop up to appear but it isn't appearing. That is what I'm struggling to find out why.
&gt;MsgBox("Check" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error") so simply posting that on it's own line does not work?
&gt;MsgBox("Check" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error") I've just tried running the script with the above command and the pop up didn't appear.
okay, just a dumb hunch, hear me out on this one. try removing the braces so it looks like this. MsgBox "Check" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error"
Just a question. Do you even fill then command with the sqlstring or is the code just hidden? As far as i know the Otherwise you could try MyDataReader.Item("FIELDNAME")...
Just tried running the script with the braces removed and still the pop up is not appearing.
damn, i'm not too sure. i'll let you know if I figure anything out.
Thanks. This script has two IF statements so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the pop up not appearing. My other scripts have one IF statement and the message box appears after running them.
that shouldn't directly affect it, but you may want to put in a small test to verify that the part of the script with the message boxes is actually running.
&gt;I've updated my script - [https://pastebin.com/azTxBAdq](https://pastebin.com/azTxBAdq) &gt; &gt;I managed to get the first pop up window to appear but I cannot get the second pop up to appear. Any help will be appreciated.
You have a function within your sub, but on your link it doesn't appear to be called. Move the function outside of the sub and call it within your code
u/MrTumblesReefer, are you meaning move the second IF statement outside of the function? Sorry I'm new to VBScripting.
Are you not getting any exception errors?
Hi u/TheBeaches, I'm getting nothing, the PSEXEC window just opens and closes. The message box in the "else" statement that is in the script (see below) is not appearing on the screen. `wscript.sleep 6000` `error1 = MsgBox("Check " &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error")` `document.write(error1)`
I know it was pointed out in the earlier post you made, but try removing error = It looks like you are setting the variable as the msgbox text but it's never being triggered
I declared error1 at the top of the script with the dim command. But I'll try removing error and try it. I'll need to remove document.write(error1) as well.
u/TheBeaches, I removed error = but the message box is still not appearing. The PSEXEC command window just flickered.
Apart from that, you need to establish where it's breaking.. I know it's not throwing an exception, but need to find out the last working line. I'm by no means an expert at VB, but what I do is use msgbox's for debugging.. I just throw them in everywhere so I can work out where it stops working, use it to check variables (making sure they are assigned correctly) and just for a line by line debug.
I'm not an expert on VB either, this is a script that was worked on by someone a few years ago and spent the lst two days trying to work out why the message box is not appearing. I've got two other scripts that have only one IF statement and the message boxes worked fine with them but this one with two IF statements, one works and the second I'm on the verge of giving up on.
Wait, it just clicked... The reason the msgbox isn't appearing is because it's in the else statement. You have mentioned you see the psexec screen popup, which means the if statement is reacting because the first check is true. It never reaches else because it doesn't need to
u/TheBeaches, okay so do I need to change the else statement to something else that will make the message box appear?
So this is what's happening... If file exists is true Run this code Else (also read as if file does not exist) Run this code End So what is happening is the file exists (strremotefilename) or whatever the variable is. So it never needs to reach the else statement. If you want to test this, place msgbox("File Found!") Above "else". So it should trigger if the file is found.
u/TheBeaches, the first IF statement needs to be correct (if not the first message box appears which it does) to then move onto the next IF statement. If the second IF statement is not correct then the second message box should appear which it isn't.
I'll try this regarding placing the msgbox above else.
not Quite Dave... the way you have written the code, it doesnt matter if the first is correct, the second If statement will always run. &amp;#x200B; Ive added comment lines to your pastebin here -[https://pastebin.com/XH2NisE1](https://pastebin.com/XH2NisE1) &amp;#x200B; As you can see, the second If statement is not dependant on the first.
u/TheBeaches, I placed the msgbox above the else statement. The msgbox didn't appear. &amp;#x200B; The scenario is that if an incorrect value is entered, the msgbox appears. If the value is correct then the script runs correctly which it is.
 [u/TheBeaches](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheBeaches/), thanks. Would an "elseif" statement be required for this scenario?
Dave, If you are saying the value is correct, the script runs... so you need to force an incorrect value to test the msgbox. My only suggestion is to next the if statements, if the first condition HAS to be correct before the second one should be considering, there is no reason to not nest them &amp;#x200B; [https://pastebin.com/pHHJJaXK](https://pastebin.com/pHHJJaXK) &amp;#x200B; See if you can work that out.
I wrote a comment a while back on the best way to connect into dbs. You want to use using and parameters. Just ignore the second half where it's using EF/linq https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/bxwv2k/noob_learning_to_connect_c_and_sql_on_vs2019/eqajf10/ Let me know if you have specific questions as that's written for sql connections and you're using ado, but the concepts are super similar.
Which version of VB?
Call whoever has local admin for help.
What happens if you go into debug mode and go line by line, does the code ever reach the second box?

I did, they were inept in supporting Visual Basic. They only know how to install Python and C environments.
I guess figure out how to get the files from this article: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/8e9ae958-2cc2-4727-9309-ed2e071c9a42/microsoft-windows-common-controls-2-60-sp6?forum=win10itprogeneral
The right answer is to do all your development on a VM running Windows XP. Beyond that I can't help you, what you doing should just work because you need the Visual Basic run time to do anything and that has the functions you're using.
I do believe I can run a VM of XP. I'll give it a try tomorrow.
u/Daakuryu, the first IF statement is reached and if a wrong value is entered then the else statement takes effect. If the value for the first IF statement is correct, moves onto the second IF statement. Once correct value for the second IF statement is entered, the script runs successfully. But after typing in a wrong value for the second statement, it just seems to stop and not go to the second else statement. I see the CSCript.exe window appear and then disappear, no message box window appears to show the message stated in the second else statement - `Dim error1` (stated at the top of the script) `wscript.sleep 7000` `error1 = MsgBox("Check " &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " is online",16,"Error")` `document.write(error1)` I think the issue lies around this area of the script - &amp;#x200B; `If objFSO.FileExists(strDestinationComputer &amp; strRemoteFile) Then` [`objShell.Run`](https://objShell.Run) `"psexec \\" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; " -s cmd /c " &amp; chr(34) &amp; "cscript.exe c:\USMTLocalLoadstate.vbs" &amp; " " &amp; strSourceComputer &amp; chr(34)`
&gt; cant post the code bcuz of char limit Ever heard of GitHub
Github let’s you have like 500 characters I think. That’s a whole bunch of tweets!
I think I get the picture but more detail would be helpful. As a start try: Rows_Deep = 5 Cols_Wide = 100 Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") For i = 1 to Cols_Wide For j =2 to Rows_Deep ws.cells(j,I).value = application.average(ws.Cells(j,1), ws.cells(j, i-1)) Next j Next i
if it's hitting the Cscript.exe then it's not seeing your value as wrong it's entering the IF portion and trying to run the thing and that fails.
So is there anyway of getting the second error message box to appear? If both values for the 2 IF statements are correct then the script runs no problem.
The Cscript window flickers on the screen but no error message box appears from the second else statement which mentions to check that the computer is online.
as I said, the fact the CScript runs means its entering the IF, since it's entering the IF it cannot enter the ELSE it's one or the other. So If objFSO.FileExists(strDestinationComputer &amp; strRemoteFile) is coming up true. you have to figure out why it's coming up true when it shouldn't
Ignore the strDestinationComputer in brackets above. That was me doing some testing. The strRemoteFile was originally in brackets for the command. strRemoteFile = "\\" &amp; strDestinationComputer &amp; "\C$\USMTLocalLoadstate.vbs" So inputting a wrong PC name for the strDestinationComputer variable should bring up the error message box but doesn’t. Sorry not very experienced with VBScript.
add code to test for empty string, or use a custom dialog that gets the value via a ByRef parameter and returns a MsgBoxResult enum value.
Try this: Made a couple small changes to it that I'll explain for you. Your Validation function was checking the result of the IsNumeric function and doing seperate returns. IsNumeric already returns a Boolean value so returning the result of that function will accomplish the same thing. This could be taken out of the method and just used in the same way by just doing: If IsNumeric(strAmountInput) = True First example. Private Function Validation(Amount As String) As Boolean 'Validate user input for InputBox Return IsNumeric(Amount) End Function If InputBox("Please enter the monthly rainfall for " &amp; strMonth).Trim &lt;&gt; "" Then strAmountInput = InputBox("Please enter the monthly rainfall for " &amp; strMonth) If Validation(strAmountInput) = True Then 'Set Value for dblAmount dblAmount = CDbl(strAmountInput) 'Add monthly rainfall amount to array, using i as index dblMonthlyRain(i) = dblAmount 'Add item displaying monthly rainfall to listbox lstMonthlyRainfall.Items.Add("Rainfall for " &amp; strMonth &amp; " = " &amp; CStr(dblMonthlyRain(i))) Else 'Prevent loop from advancing if validation fails, forces user to enter valid input before moving on MsgBox("Please enter numbers only.", 64, "Invalid Input") Exit Sub End If End if Second Example: Dim UserInput As String = InputBox("Please enter the monthly rainfall for " &amp; strMonth).Trim If UserInput &lt;&gt; "" And IsNumeric(UserInput) Then 'Set Value for dblAmount dblAmount = CDbl(strAmountInput) 'Add monthly rainfall amount to array, using i as index dblMonthlyRain(i) = dblAmount 'Add item displaying monthly rainfall to listbox lstMonthlyRainfall.Items.Add("Rainfall for " &amp; strMonth &amp; " = " &amp; CStr(dblMonthlyRain(i))) Else 'Prevent loop from advancing if validation fails, forces user to enter valid input before moving on MsgBox("Please enter numbers only.", 64, "Invalid Input") Exit Sub End If Hope this helps.
Put a breakpoint at that IF Statement (or if you don't have line by line debugger then put two message boxes) and check what strDestinationComputer and strRemoteFile at the moment before it checks if it's true.
Sorry but what is a breakpoint in VBScript? I’ve been spending the last two days trying to figure out why the second message box has not appeared?
When you're using a dev tool with an attached debugger (Visual studio for instance) you can click on the side of a line of code to tell the debugger **I want you to pause the program here** this allows you to view your variables or by hitting a specific button go through the code line by line. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Script_Debugger When you're coding, something like that is essential or else you wind up doing exactly what you just said, spend two days running in circles because you don't know WHAT the code is actually doing. You're just making assumptions. But, as I said if you don't have or don't want to install a debugger then you have to go old school and have message boxes tell you what your variable and your IF results actually are instead of guessing they are right/wrong because you say so.

My thought is the best way to protect your software is to not distribute it as a desktop application. If you must make sure you have some web service that it relies on to operate. Manage their access to the services with an account and monitor their usage. Charge per request or per IP address or some model like that.

look into a streamreader the way I'd do it would be to stream each line into an array and then sort the array however you'd like, then use a streamwriter to write everything back into the textfile once you've done all your calculations and sorting
Put the code that records the time under a subroutine that only happens upon the ".load" event instead of the ".show" event
In your template, replace the date/time with a placeholder such as %TIME%. Update your code to replace that placeholder with the format you want and drop it into .load. Since all the coffee is doing is replacing a set string, once it's done that the first time you open it, it can't do it again as the string isn't there on subsequent openings to replace. Just make sure you placeholder is something that will never be in an actual document.
Your application only has one execution thread, meaning it can only execute 1 bit of code at once, so if you are in a loop, nothing else (like clicking a button) can work. To get around this in VB forms you use a timer, which I can see you already have added. move the code inside the while loop into the Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick sub, and delete the thread.sleep() line too
 If Me.Controls("button" &amp; a).Text = "1" Then 'do stuff End If 'Me' represents the form. If the control you want to access is not directly on the form, but inside a container like a groupbox or panel, you would use that object instead of the 'Me'
Hey Fotty, &amp;#x200B; That works perfectly I have if possible just 1 followup question. What would it look like if I wanted to reference a Setting inside My.Settings instead of a Button's text? but instead a Settings "value"? Great still with the Me.Controls I added that to my toolbelt.
Meaning you want to access settings by name but use a variable as part of the name?
Hey TheFotty, &amp;#x200B; Yes I want to run a loop using a variable that changes each loop (1,2,3, etc) and from that I want it to pull the My.Settings Names so for example My.Settings.set1 in the first loop then next it will pull My.Settings.set2, etc and keep looping where each loop is focusing on each certain selected save. I understood that I could do things like "My.Settings.set"&amp;a.toString but I'm not sure how I can then later pull that "value" of that set1 (say it's false) so I can then run a test where is set1 = false then (output). Thoughts?
Hey TheFotty, &amp;#x200B; To add to my last description I'm just going to write some code to show &amp;#x200B; **I want to replace:** &gt;If My.Settings.Notes1 = False Then &gt; &gt;Notes1.text = "False" &gt; &gt;Else &gt; &gt;Notes1.text="True" &gt; &gt;End If &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If My.Settings.Notes2 = False Then &gt; &gt;Notes2.text = "False" &gt; &gt;Else &gt; &gt;Notes2.text="True" &gt; &gt;End If &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If My.Settings.Notes3 = False Then &gt; &gt;Notes3.text = "False" &gt; &gt;Else &gt; &gt;Notes3.text="True" &gt; &gt;End If &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If My.Settings.Notes4 = False Then &gt; &gt;Notes4.text = "False" &gt; &gt;Else &gt; &gt;Notes4.text="True" &gt; &gt;End If &amp;#x200B; **Into:** &gt;For a=1 to 4 &gt; &gt;Dim setting = "My.Settings.Note" &amp; a.toString &gt; &gt;Dim note = "Note" &amp; a.toString &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If setting = False Then &gt; &gt;note.text = False &gt; &gt;Else &gt; &gt;note.text = True &gt; &gt;End If &gt; &gt;a += 1 &gt; &gt;Next a &amp;#x200B; Let me know what you think?
 Dim intValue = 1 Dim mySettingsProperty = My.Settings.PropertyValues("set" &amp; intValue.ToString) If mySettingsProperty IsNot Nothing Then MessageBox.Show(mySettingsProperty.PropertyValue.ToString) Else MessageBox.Show("Invalid Setting Name") End If
Hey TheFotty, &amp;#x200B; I tried the script you listed above and implemented it into my setup and It kept saying the setting PropertyValues were Nothing when they is not the case. Going to mess further with your code to try and hash it out and update this as of tomorrow, thanks further still for checking into this.
Have you actually set them yet or are they just currently all set to default values?
Declaring the variables does not create the arrays. You have to explicitly create them. As it is they are both Nothing
Depends on what you are looking to do? If you are looking to program for yourself or small projects outside of a "professional programmer" position, I think VB is perfect. I use it regularly for small personal projects and a few things I am working on for my employer, but I work at a small company and am not employed specifically as a programmer.
VB is dead. Learn C#
I was looking for a language that can go from zero to app development, that is also used for business applications and won't be dying anytime soon. I build small things for spreadsheets in VBA currently.
VB does have that. You can make mobile apps, desktop apps, web apps, and even API's in VB. I first started programming in basic in 1986, though it has gone through many changes; I believe it has the same staying power as C or assembly.
i don't think this is true. Yes it would be good to learn C# but VB isn't dead by all means. VB will be even be supported in .NET Core 3.0.
Yeah, it's great for building utilities too because you can slap everything together pretty quickly I used to for all kids of stuff for our IT group ("we sure could use a tool to do XXX"). Note though, it's getting harder to find solutions for VB.Net issues or information if you want ideas on how to code something specific, most stuff out there is geared towards C# now.
Yeah. That was pretty helpful. Your comment is dead
Well. It seems like you don’t know the entire family well. BASIC is a syntax that comes in flavors. Visual BASIC is one of them. Visual BASIC for Applications is also one. VB.Net is yet another one. If you want to do application programming and website dev I suggest you download Visual Studio Community edition and look into whatever you wanna program. CB is supported in most template projects be it app dev (both mobile and desktop) and webdev.
Just because you don't use it doesn't mean it's dead
VB.NET is quite usable and already knowing VBA will probably help you make the transition.
Because you didn't declare the size of your arrays, I think is the problem. http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?88161-Can-I-declare-an-array-with-unknown-size
I disagree! I have been programming with VB since GWBasic was new. I am self employed and have more clients that I know what to do with! I have also worked for both large (GE Power, BAX Global Logistic, etc), medium (VT Teddy Bear, GIS) and small companies as well. Choose whatever language you like and as long as you can find work, who cares whether your chosen language is at the top of the list or not. &gt;Just for accuracy's sake. According to an article in ZDNet a study by Tiobe last year (2018) placed [VB.Net](https://VB.Net) in 5th position of most popular languages ... Ahead of both C# and JavaScript I might add. &amp;#x200B; Good luck with your studies!
This is correct. You're trying to check the length of an empty object. The only way to accomplish what you're doing is to ReDim the array each time it needs to be enlarged. Make sure you specify the "Preserve" flag when doing the ReDim or it will wipe the array every time you do it. Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement
Or use a List. There are almost no cases in which an array is better than a List
^
Search the table when a document is opened, and if it doesn't exist, add it, otherwise do nothing. Simple If statement will do the trick.
This seems like the most practical route; could you explain to me how to write the If-statement? I don't write code or know any Visual Basic.
 hash_generator(ByRef file_name As String, ByRef file_name As String) why 2 parameters with the same name?
delete one? or what?
You can't have two parameters with the same name. How is the code supposed to know the difference between the first parameter file_name and the second, since it's the same name. You need to have two different names.
I deleted one, and that fixed it.
you're welcome :)
Agreed -- I switched over to this in my last few projects. Dim CountyAndState as New List(Of String) ... CountyAndState.Add(strResidence) No need to worry about incrementing an index value. The .Add method does it for you.
I tend to not use the same name for the instantiated object. For clarity sake even if there is no longer a requirement. Dim MyWebClient as new WebClient If there are more than one I will go to the next level of detail. dim Instance1WebClinet as new WebClient dim Instance2WebClient as new WebClient Just pick a method you are comfortable with, put it in your technical documentation and then be consistent.
seems to me that readable code is the only issue. comment on it inline. not everyone gets time to read documentation. just sayin
Don't confuse a variable with a type by giving it same name. I have had 'obj' as prefix for the last 15+ years
I tend to use a “p” prefix for procedure level objects, m for module, c for class, and f for form. Like fWebView, etc I’ll use different prefixes if I have multiple objects of the same type
You can use the `Format$()` function, but since decimal is reserved you have to escape it with backslashes `Format$(yournumber, "###\.######\.###")`
It works! Thank you so much, man! You truly are a master.
Is this for VBA and word? Create a hidden checkbox on the document and use that as a persistent flag
Yep, using a macro-enabled word template. What do you mean about the hidden checkbox? I’m only beginning to delve into the VBA side of Microsoft office
Well you can make a new userform in from the VB window (Alt+F11) Insert &gt; Userform Add a CheckBox to it. You can reference it in code ala UserForm1.Checkbox1.Checked using the default names unless you rename things
 Dim theFile as string = "*path to the file*" If System.IO.File.Exists(theFile) = True Then Dim file As New System.IO.StreamWriter(theFile , **False**) for each arrangeditem in arranged2 file.writeline(arrangeditem) next End If
I don't know if this is a text-based game or graphical. But if it's graphical, you could add either an animation for each AI player, or a progress bar when it's their turn. You could use a hard loop to draw the animation/progress bar, and if it locks up the game that's fine - people expect things to be unresponsive during progress bars. There have been studies that show that people dislike a slow process less if a progress bar is drawn: they feel like something's happening. Even if the process takes a bit longer with the bar than without it, the non-bar process is perceived as taking longer. Even if it's a text-based game you can do a "progress bar" just by drawing a line of periods (dots) every tenth of a second or whatever.
&gt;Using the sleep command locks up the whole game for a bit...Hard loops, same thing. That's because everything is in a single thread. If you want to leave the main form alone while your AI are "thinking" move your sleep/hard loops and AI moves to a timer or implement threading.
It's graphical. And it's a fairly complicated game where players can make multiple moves per turn, and possibly win in one turn if their cards work out. So starting up a new game and being told "Fred has one!" before you even start looks broken, even though he legitimately played his cards out. The AI is a bunch of nested loops, recursively checking for new moves that opened up after their previous move. But I need it to at least pause for a second after each move, so the player can register that a move was made.
thanks for your help
just as a sidenote because I didn't mention it you should always try to put file names as variable like I did in my example. It allows you to just call on the file name to do other IO stuff like checking if the file exists. You can also break it down into Path and Name (even type) variables which you can merge back later, usually useful when you are dealing with one folder but potentially multiple file names. so dim thePath as string = "C:\Temp\" dim theFile as string = "leaderboad.txt" 'Optionally leave the .txt out of the previous one and do dim theExt as string = ".txt" then when you need it you can do dim fullPath = thePath &amp; theFile &amp; theExt
Store the result of the InputBox and do your validation there.
 Dim userInput as string = InputBox("Enter Number:") Do While IsNumeric(userInput) = False AndAlso CInt(userInput) &gt; maxValueAllowed userInput = InputBox("Invalid Value, please enter a number that is less than " &amp; maxValueAllowed") Loop
You can either do a masked text box or handle the text changed event on the text box. I am assuming you are using vb.net.
You want to separate your UX logic from your game engine logic. Many real world games make executions that decide whether the player wins or loses in a split second, with the graphics and animations being entirely for show. This is how slot machines function today--the outcome has already been decided before the spin even takes place, yet it's abstracted away where the player has no idea. Do the same for your program, let the moves happen in milliseconds under the hood while allowing your user experience code to control the flow of how information is displayed with time in between moves, represented in the form of an animation like three blinking dots above the AI's name when the AI is "thinking" (even though it actually isn't). Rather than using a Threading.Thread.Sleep(numOfMilliseconds) function that pauses the execution of your entire program after each move, you'd want a timed animation function to occur, with the number of seconds determined by how many moves the computer makes. So take a base wait value of 2 seconds and add 1.5 seconds for each of the computer's moves added to the timer. You can display "Fred has won!" whenever you'd like, the message output doesn't have to be directly hard coded to the moment that the computer's card count reaches a value that derermines it's the winner. You can code it to display after all of the animations are complete first.
Ideally, I'd want to animate the actual AI moves. Show the cards going from the hand to the table, and vice versa. That way it would feel like you're actually in a game. That's a lot of math, though, lerping an x and y coordinate from one point to another across the screen. I think the flow needs to be: Make a decision about which play to make Animate that play. Repeat until no more moves are possible. Currently, there's no animation. The cards just teleport, and all possible moves are made in one nested loop. I'm going to have to break that logic up into separate functions, and call them as needed.
Use timers. Make a timer count to 5 (tick every second), and when it's done, disable itself and execute the AI turn code.
I actually tried that exact thing. For some reason, it just paused before every turn and then executed every move all at once, instead of pausing between every play.
Per their post, they're using an InputBox()
Use use a if statement with isnumeric(object)=true/false to check.
Here is a simple sample which I found on the web. I modified it to be in VB instead of C# and it seems to work. It needs a form, a button on the form (button1) and a datagridview (datagridview1) &amp;#x200B; `Public Class Form1` `Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`Button1.Click`](https://Button1.Click) &amp;#x200B; `Dim Reader As New System.IO.StreamReader("D:\MyCSVFile.csv")` &amp;#x200B; `Dim Var = Reader.ReadToEnd` &amp;#x200B; `Dim DT As DataTable = NewDataTable("D:\MyCSVFile.csv", ",", True)` &amp;#x200B; `DataGridView1.DataSource = DT` &amp;#x200B; `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `Public Shared Function NewDataTable(ByVal fileName As String, ByVal delimiters As String, ByVal Optional firstRowContainsFieldNames As Boolean = True) As DataTable` &amp;#x200B; `Dim result As DataTable = New DataTable()` &amp;#x200B; `Using tfp As Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser = New Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser(fileName` `tfp.SetDelimiters(delimiters)` `If Not tfp.EndOfData Then` `Dim fields As String() = tfp.ReadFields()` `For i As Integer = 0 To fields.Count() - 1` `If firstRowContainsFieldNames Then` `result.Columns.Add(fields(i))` `Else` `result.Columns.Add("Col" &amp; i)` `End If` `Next` &amp;#x200B; `If Not firstRowContainsFieldNames Then result.Rows.Add(fields)` `End If` &amp;#x200B; `While Not tfp.EndOfData` `result.Rows.Add(tfp.ReadFields())` `End While` &amp;#x200B; `End Using` &amp;#x200B; `Return result` &amp;#x200B; `End Function` &amp;#x200B; End Class
Oh god, I really am new. While I get the gist of most of this, I have to admit to being a bit dumb here. At the section where you set the New Microsoft TextFieldParser, I see a bracket without a closing bracket, and I'm not sure where to place the closing bracket. Additionally, in the same area, it starts with (fileName , and I'm dumb enough to be wondering if I'm supposed to be entering in my own File Name, or leave it saying fileName. If I am supposed to be entering in my own file name, is that intended to be my Project name?
HI, &amp;#x200B; Sorry about that, must have missed it on the copy/paste. Also the "filename" gets passed to the function when you click the button. So in the button event where it has "D:\\MyCSVFile.csv" Replace that with your file name. the final parameter that says "True" is whether or not your CSV file has column names in the first row. How's this? &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`Button1.Click`](https://Button1.Click) &amp;#x200B; `Dim Reader As New System.IO.StreamReader("D:\MyCSVFile.csv")` &amp;#x200B; `Dim Var = Reader.ReadToEnd` &amp;#x200B; `Dim DT As DataTable = NewDataTable("D:\MyCSVFile.csv", ",", True)` &amp;#x200B; `DataGridView1.DataSource = DT` &amp;#x200B; `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `Public Shared Function NewDataTable(ByVal fileName As String, ByVal delimiters As String, ByVal Optional firstRowContainsFieldNames As Boolean = True) As DataTable` &amp;#x200B; `Dim result As DataTable = New DataTable()` &amp;#x200B; `Using tfp As Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser = New Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser(fileName)` &amp;#x200B; `tfp.SetDelimiters(delimiters)` &amp;#x200B; `If Not tfp.EndOfData Then` &amp;#x200B; `Dim fields As String() = tfp.ReadFields()` &amp;#x200B; `For i As Integer = 0 To fields.Count() - 1` &amp;#x200B; `If firstRowContainsFieldNames Then` `result.Columns.Add(fields(i))` `Else` `result.Columns.Add("Col" &amp; i)` `End If` `Next` &amp;#x200B; `If Not firstRowContainsFieldNames Then result.Rows.Add(fields)` `End If` &amp;#x200B; `While Not tfp.EndOfData` `result.Rows.Add(tfp.ReadFields())` `End While` &amp;#x200B; `End Using` &amp;#x200B; `Return result` &amp;#x200B; `End Function`
No need to overcomplicate this with oledb. CSV files are not excel files. They're just plain text. If your CSV doesn't have quotes or commas within values just use the answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43974213/how-to-import-csv-file-to-my-datagridview-in-vb-net
Thank you kind stranger!
NP - Glad to help
Okay, I've finished making it and debugging, but I still have 5 errors left, all saying that such-and-such is not declared, it may be inaccessible due to its protection level. I have been assuming this is because my file path is broken, and I've been trying everything I can think of to fix it. I copy-pasted the path, C:\Users\Greg\Desktop\Excel Try for Import.csv. I have tried adding the extra slashes as the guy in the YouTube video suggested, but it's still not working. Any ideas? And no, the file is not protected. It's just a dummy file I made to experiment with.
Zip up the entire project and send to me here (hope I make the link correctly lol) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7amlzanwi7zndv/AAB2cj6RehZK0AI1jFlpIGVaa?dl=0
Buy a NAS or something. How is this VB related?
Tangential; I have a program that I need to access and alter since text filled at multiple pc locations. They are in the same room so I don't need cloud services; and windows 10 file sharing is not working. I was looking for the simplest way a VB project could access non local ( but not too non local) files
What about FTP? Plenty of free FTP servers and VB resources for it.
Could you recommend one for an absolute beginning? I've never done anything network related at all ( hence looking to just connect to another hard drive with no frills)
Well to get started you could run a FileZilla FTP server: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server There are plenty of other free servers of course. Here's an example of uploading/downloading files to and from an FTP server: http://vbcity.com/blogs/xtab/archive/2016/04/13/how-to-upload-and-download-files-with-ftp-from-a-vb-net-application.aspx That site is not mobile friendly, so read on a PC. The examples are about as basic as you can get.
Thanks! I am looking this over now I think thought I may have overstated the simplicity of my problem. Lets say I have a text file (File A) and Two PCs (1 and 2) I want to be able to read File A on PC 1; but also on PC 2 append a line to File A, and when I read it again on PC 1 see the appended line With FTP it seems that I would need to have PC2 download it, append the text, then upload and replace the previous file before PC1 reads it-- to see the new line
Not exactly. A large number of FTP servers support an "append" command. So you would upload your data, specifying the file and the append command and it will append the data to it. I don't have any examples on hand but might be able to throw something together tomorrow.
Sorry I'm getting back so late. I've been so busy. I currently use an online SQL database at the moment for mine and some encrypted hardware ids similar to windows xp (did a lot of the hardware change since last time? If so, it needs to be addressed). May seem like a hassle but I think it may work.
i can see what you're asking for and have had some good replies. the trouble is file locking. you cannot write to the same file from more than location. and is good. So how do SQL etc do it. I'm sure there are a lot of ways. but for something LAN and non commercial.. maybe firing a batch script to his app (yes, support command line) will be useful?? https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=realtimesync
Wouldn't it be easier to use the NumericUpDown control? Then you can just set the minimum value and maximum value. The NumericUpDown control will only allow integers. I assume you're in an older version of visualbasic because your'e using a "inputbox" wich i think is from VB6. I don't know if the NumericUpDown control even exists in that version.
Answering my own question. 1. [Add regkey to use IE11](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2011/May/21/Web-Browser-Control-Specifying-the-IE-Version#Values) 2. Add webbrowser control 3. WebBrowser1.Navigate(url) 4. Handle DocumentCompleted event (including Select Case WebBrowser1.Url.ToString) 5. WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("username").SetAttribute("value", username) WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("password").SetAttribute("value", password) WebBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("login").InvokeMember("click")
Ooh, even easier, kind of. You don't need a form and the browser need not be visible. 1. Add an import: Imports System.Windows.Forms 2. Declare module level browser with events: Dim WithEvents Browser As New WebBrowser 3. Create and navigate: Browser.CreateControl() Browser.Navigate("http://google.com") 4. Add the handler for DocumentCompleted: Private Sub Page_Loaded(sender As Object, e As WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs) Handles Browser.DocumentCompleted
Well, that's a lot more difficult than you might think, since when you hit a button, it will focus the button, and will type the sentence on... Nothing (or worse, the space character will trigger the button again). You could probably use some convoluted system to gram the handle of the control that lost focus, and refocus after the click, but my advice: just use something better suited, like AutoHotKey.
Simple .. Make a windows form, add two buttons. This is the code behind &amp;#x200B; `Imports System.Timers` &amp;#x200B; `Public Class Form1` &amp;#x200B; `Private WithEvents MyTimer As New System.Timers.Timer` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`Button1.Click`](https://Button1.Click) `Me.MyTimer.Start()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles` [`Button2.Click`](https://Button2.Click) `Me.MyTimer.Stop()` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub MyTimer_Elapsed(sender As Object, e As ElapsedEventArgs) Handles MyTimer.Elapsed` `Debug.Print("Some Sentence")` `End Sub` &amp;#x200B; `Private Sub Form1_Shown(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown` `Me.MyTimer.Interval = New TimeSpan(hours:=0, minutes:=0, seconds:=5).TotalMilliseconds` `Me.MyTimer.AutoReset = True` `End Sub` `End Class`
AppActivate and SendKeys.
Not sure that's what OP is after.
thanks, i got it to work
try removing the setRequestHeader line
I can't speak to Outlook in particular, but any time you are changing a collection that you are iterating through, "for each" doesn't work. You should iterate through it backwards (from last element to first) using a traditional "for" loop (with step -1). That way, as you remove elements from the list it doesn't cause problems with the loop.
Ah, backwards. Thank you.
or use a while loop while item count &gt; 0 get first item process and move
It's 1-based, and that works. For Index = Items.Count To 1 Step -1 Item = CType(Items(Index), Outlook.MailItem) Item.Move(Processed) Next
Wouldn't that cause a re-evaluation of count every loop?
yes, but if you need it in a set order, it's the cost of holding specs. I can tell you from some experience, this will not be any kind of significant part of your processing time. outlook likes to take its sweet time about things.
&gt;this will not be any kind of significant part of your processing time. Oh, i know. But still. :) &gt;outlook likes to take its sweet time about things. Strangely, it saved attachments from some 90 emails and moved them in seconds. I was surprised. &gt;yes, but if you need it in a set order, it's the cost. The For loop with Step -1 works just fine. It seems simpler to me as well. But i do like your solution.
`(True, "hello world")`is just shorthand syntax for `New ValueTuple(Of Boolean, String)(True, "hello world")`, which is not a constant expression. The only constant expression you can provide for non-primitive types is `Nothing`, which in the case of this tuple is equivalent to `(False, Null)`.
Aaah. So the error is, as stated, related to the optional syntax and not to the tuple syntax. Thanks.
`True` and `"hello world"` are constants. A constructor call is not a constant, even if the parameters are constants.
Couple things. Anytime you're creating something that you can "open" like a file, db connection, http connection, stream, etc. use a using Instead of dim Application = new outlook.application do using application as new outlook.application end using What that does is make sure things get properly closed. This will help you avoid leaving hanging db cons, files getting locked, etc. when you have an unexpected error. I don't have the outlook library, but I think you could do something like Outside of using the "using" thing as I recommended, there's no reason you can't define things like that, I do all the time. Especially when doing linq db updates where you're only changing one thing. If you don't like doing all the variable stuff, don't forget you can use a with to define an object and it's properties in one line. I.e. Dim cust = New Customer cust.FirstName = "bill" cust.LastName = "brasky" Can be Dim cust = New Customer With {.FirstName = "bill", .LastName = "brasky"}
Your style is your style, but in my opinion you're making your code harder to read with no upside. Creating additional "useless" variables bugs you, and I get that to some extent. But the upside of those variables is: 1. It makes debugging a lot easier. You can step through each line and easily inspect the object. If everything's in one line, that's technically possible but harder. 2. It's just WAY easier to read the first 2 lines than the second single line. You should be writing for readability, not (presumed) optimization or trying for a minimum number of lines. The compiler is probably going to create the same code either way so all you're doing is making your code slightly shorter but also less readable.
COM objects play by different rules. They don't implement IDisposable. Instead you may need to call `Marshall.FinalReleaseComObject(object)` on each and every object you touch. Failure to do so may leave the application running in the background.
Thanx. I was wondering when i ought to use Using. I only learnt of it recently, but most examples don't seem to use it. A few do, so i have been trying to get a feel for it. Should i just replace "all" dim statements like that with Using? I also have: Dim Document As PDDocument which gets set in a loop: For Each File In My.Computer.FileSystem.GetFiles(direcotry, FileIO.SearchOption.SearchTopLevelOnly, "*.pdf") Document = PDDocument.load(File) If Document IsNot Nothing Then Document.close() Next I got the close line from an example. I assume Using would *not* be a good choice there because it should closed. Not sure. Any ideas about (New PDDocument).save though?
Well I don't have those libraries so I couldn't tell you off hand without adding them and testing, for the save thing. Yea you don't always need to use a using, I wasn't sure what type of objects those were, but it's a good habit to get into.
1. Better debugging. I get that. I split it up when it is an issue. 2. Easier to read. I wholeheartedly disagree. I have such a hard time reading code that doesn't get to the point. Declaring variables that are used just once drive me crazy. I find the single line ones to be much easier and much faster to understand. Perhaps, kind of like using a separate subroutines just to enclose a few lines of code as one "function," which make it easier to understand. For me, number 2 far, far outweighs number 1. I understand everyone is different, but as i am writing and working on my own code, condensing things to get to the point is aids understanding.
It's just the objects i am using so i gave working code as the example. But it ought to be the case with any object is needed only for a method it provides.
Well a lot of objects have to be instantiated before you can use them so there isn't always a way around it.
Yeah, and that is what the New is for. My question is if it needs to be assigned to a variable that will never be used.
If you're accessing that method, and it's not a member of the instance and not the class itself, aren't you using the variable?
Fair enough. As I said, your style is your style. I'm just glad I don't have to read your code :) I find 5 small lines much easier to read than one condensed line. That's just me. Maybe it's because I started programming using assembly so I'm used to each line doing one tiny thing because that was the only option...
&gt; I'm just glad I don't have to read your code :) Right back at ya. :P &gt;Maybe it's because I started programming using assembly That makes sense, because you are used to looking at small paragraphs as doing one thing. Mini functions, per se. But, i would think the real reason would be how simply due to how you think. I come from the outside, wanting to know what the box does, action by action. In my mind, preparatory statements need to be ignored (in most cases) so as not to confuse wondering what their function is. Often i will name functions by what they do, almost as a sentence, so the main() routine reads: Prepare_Variables() Get_The_Files_To_Work_On() Process_The_Files() Update_The_Database() I don't do that all the time, but it make everything so much easier to read. But i look at statements of code that way too. That ought to do something, otherwise they confuse me.
Sure i'm using it, but for just one thing. So having a name is redundant. This is allowed when following an = sign, as in the example above. I want to know if it can be done without the = sign.
It sounds like what you're looking for is a Shared function (approximately equivalent to Static in C#). Class MyStaticClass 'Declare New() as Private to prevent instantiation Private Sub New() End Sub Public Shared Function MyMethod() As String MsgBox("Test") End Sub End Class Then you can call MyStaticClass.MyMethod() in your code without having to instantiate anything as MyStaticClass.
The question is: can you do this with an object.
So the problem is, you ARE using the variable. In your example Dim Application = New Outlook.Application Dim Session = Application.Session You can't just call Application.Session because Application is just a class. It's not anything until you say New Outlook.Application. Think of it like a blueprint and your variable is a house. You can't live in a blueprint because nothing exists, it's just a structure to build something. When you say dim foo = new something you're telling your application to actually build the house (instatiate the object), using the blueprint (based on the class) Without the new statement, there was never an Application object anywhere to create a session from.
That's the point. You don't need to instantiate an object. When you say: Dim myObj as New myClass You're instantiating an object using myClass as the template. The 'variable' you're talking about is the object. In the code in my previous reply, you don't need to do that at all. You just call the method directly from the class. Sorry, reading over your post again, I should have specified that this applies to your second question. For your first question, I don't know if there's a good way to get around that. It looks like you're trying to use JS syntax in VB. Unfortunately, these are very different beasts.
I understand that. But i was able to inline the instantiation without giving it a name: Dim Session = (New Outlook.Application).Session Application is instantiated, .Session is called, and i have no reference to Application (well, Session.Application might be it). This works just fine.
I’ve never programmed in VB, but you may set every number as a variable, and every time the program will choose a new number, it will check if it is the same number as in one of the variables, and if it isn’t it chooses a new number. 🤷‍♂️ Ps. I’m not experienced in programming, so I’m sorry if it isn’t what you are looking for. This year I’m going to IB high school, and in 2 years I will be studying programming in school, so everything I know right now is from book headfirst java
There's only one question there. I just wanted to know if there was a way to do it, since VB supports it when it comes after an equals sign, as in the example above.
Are you sure those are the parameters actually being passed to SQL? I would use SQL Server Profiler in SSMS to verify that what you think is being passed is actually being passed. An observation &gt; The difference between the queries is the like condition and also the second query doesn't have any strings. So, I would also double check you are setting the string variable correctly. I suspect that you have added gratuitous quotes in the @SupplierProduct parameter.
No, unless you declare your class as public shared which doesn’t create an instance of an object. In order to use an object in any type of OOP language, it has to be instantiated and initialized. We have something similar in C# which is static, we mainly declare things as static when we don’t need an instance of an object like math or tool classes. Static and publish shared classes are typically faster and more performant because an object doesn’t need to be created and allocated in memory, but when overused can be a terrible thing.
No, you can’t do this. Either use a design pattern, mark it as public shared, or if you’re too lazy to write it, use “With” and “End with”. I have not used VB in a while but you can also just import the namespace.
This is really a syntactical question. As mention in the posted, it can be done when following an =. I just wanted to know if there was a way to do it without being after an =. It's the same operation, that is, instantiate the object and don't assign the reference to anything (in the main program). I'm okay if its not allowed. I was just curious if the syntax was possible.
&gt; I suspect that you have added gratuitous quotes in the @SupplierProduct parameter. Well they weren't gratuitous but apparently the query passed to the server by the fill adds 300 of them so it didn't need my frugally added ones... exec sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM vProducts WHERE 1=1 AND EventCode IN ( 0 ) AND Supplierproduct like @SupplierProduct ORDER BY SupplierProduct ASC OFFSET @MinRow ROWS FETCH NEXT @MaxRows ROWS ONLY',N'@SupplierProduct nvarchar(9),@MinRow int,@MaxRows int',@SupplierProduct=N'''%00012%''',@MinRow=0,@MaxRows=100 Thanks a bunch for the fresh pair of eyeballs.
Create a class with a function that takes a form as an input then loops through all control in said form checking for the control type (will probably have to do something to dig down into containers into containers into containers... depending on how much control nesting you've done.) then set the font of any labels you find to the new font (Assuming it's the same for all of them because if not then you need to be able to differentiate and at that point might as well just change em all manually.) I've made a similar function for my data driven translation module, takes a form and a dataset with all the words in the form and puts the correct language in.
can you show us the error please? also, you do not appear to be cleansing or a better word "sanitising" the input. Are you sure there's not a space or other character being input INSERT INTO is .. uh. doable, but there no lookup to be certain you're not overwriting anything. theres no unique identifier. you need "Update" &lt;DBName&gt; .. argh. i really need to see the error to fix that one problem you're having, but you will encounter others as you proceeed.
This is all it says: https://i.imgur.com/bTspmS5.png I'd be happy to see another error, I've been trying things and getting this same hour for a while now and it's frustrating to say the least...
syntax error. good. syntax can be solved. :) if you manage to get a moment, expand the error detail + symbol. it'll really help. all info is useful :) i still would like to see an "*update Names*" above your code.
The word “Names” maybe a reserved word. Try enclosing it in brackets: CommandDB.CommandText = "INSERT INTO [Names](FirstName,MiddleName,LastName) VALUES(@First,@Middle,@Last)"
You can try to capture the SQL sentence from CommandDB.CommandText, and execute it in the SQL Management Studio
&gt; so there isn't always a way around it. In this case there is, by using the Call statement. I edited the post to show it.
&gt; No, you can’t do this. I needed the Call statement. I updated the post to show it.
after making the change /u/Dexahecimal suggested (thought I don't believe names is a reserved name) Put a break point at CommandDB.ExecuteNonQuery() Then go to the immediate window and type in the following Debug.Print(CommandDB.CommandText) Debug.Print(CommandDB.Parameters.Count) Debug.Print(CommandDB.Parameters.Item(0).ParameterName &amp; " " &amp; CommandDB.Parameters.Item(0).value) Debug.Print(CommandDB.Parameters.Item(1).ParameterName &amp; " " &amp; CommandDB.Parameters.Item(1).value) Debug.Print(CommandDB.Parameters.Item(2).ParameterName &amp; " " &amp; CommandDB.Parameters.Item(2).value) ... put a as many of the Debug.Print(CommandDB.Parameters.Item().ParameterName &amp; " " &amp; CommandDB.Parameters.Item().value) as you have parameters. Thank post all of that here.
Add a semicolon after the statement.
`Herd(0)` returns a copy of a cow, not the original cow. When you change Moo on this copy, you then immediately discard said copy. *** Either use an array instead of a list OR make cow into a class.
Structure or "value types" are passed along by making copies. You have to be incredibly careful to not accidentally make a copy. To make things safer, the base rule is to make value types "immutable", meaning that you can't alter their properties after they are created. Mutable values types exist, but only for high performance scenarios carefully written by experts. And even then, only when there is no other option.
Thank you. I was just looking for a List to store values in, and the code is working fine with struct. I actually set a local List by creating instances of the struct and list.add(), and after the loop is finished, appending it to the main List after each loop. I didn't bump into the issue until i tried looping through the main List to set one more property, at which point i just added a setter method. But i will need access to all the values later. Perhaps a class is what i need, as you explained.
As a professional, I create one Structure for every 100 classes I write. They really are for very specialized purposes.
Semicolon is only really necessary if you have multiple statements in the same query that might interfere with each others execution.
Makes sense. I had looked at the documentation for [SqlParameterCollection.AddWithValue(String, Object) Method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlparametercollection.addwithvalue?view=netframework-4.8), and their example was one statement and it used a semicolon, so i figured that might help here. I guess not.
Thanx. I did not know that. I guess i will change it to a class next week.
WOW! WHAT? THANKS! I *literally* put brackets around everything else except "Names" and was like "huh must not be a reserved word issue. I wonder what the issue is then..." Well that's a relief lol
It actually was the "Names" not being in brackets. I looked up the list of reserved words and 'names' wasn't on there so I thought nothing of it. Must be something else going on that has that word reserved or something.
Apparently "Names" is a reserved word and needed to be in brackets, even though it isn't included in the list of reserved words in the documentation. Must be reserved by something else I have connected to it or something. Anyways thanks for the help! Really appreciated!
Idk if anyone ever got back to you on this but if it's saying something is not declared you either have the variable declared in a private sub and it can't be accessed where you're calling it from or it isn't declared at all. Like "Dim i As New Integer" etc.
not at all. thanks for coming back and helping us all with sharing your time and efforts. Without that communal spirit and giving and taking the time, we are just stunting the ones that prob will help us in the future. :) Thanks :)
I've been out of town all week, so I haven't had a chance to mess with it. I've tried several different options that I've seen around the web. Nothing has worked so far, but I'll be able to play with it this weekend.
i like this. the thread is wholesome. nobody snapping and being spiteful or harsh on other advisors. The community found the solution based on information garnered. the community garnered enough information, and the presenter of the problem cooperated fully and helpfully. not resentufully. ultimately someone could identify and solve.In many ways, we do have something better than stackexchange. I'm proud to be part of that. whatever it is.
Create a timer and ENABLE it when you press the button. When the timer TICKS run the "left click" code AND turn off the timer (Enable = false)
What do you mean by click? Like you want it to click something? If so, I think you can do something along the lines of MyButtonId.PerformClick You get your wait thing by thread.sleep. Just google a little bit and you should be able to find the right syntax.
Or do you mean like literally emulate a mouse click and click whatever you're hovered over?
