Yep that seems to be the problem - with forcing them to be Decimal I get it to be much more accurate. Using the Mod addition from [ViperSRT3g](https://www.reddit.com/user/ViperSRT3g) I can see that z now has 28 sigfigs. Thanks! 100 --&gt; N(c) = 2 10-2 --&gt; N(c) = 30 10-4 --&gt; N(c) = 312 10-6 --&gt; N(c) = 3140 10-8 --&gt; N(c) = 31414 10-10 --&gt; N(c) = 314157 10-12 --&gt; N(c) = 3141591 10-14 --&gt; N(c) = 31415925 
As I said in the previous post, what your code is doing is resetting the question again and again. What you want is to reset the question every time the user clicks the button. Try code below... Dim count As Integer = 1 Private Sub btnNextQ_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnNextQ.Click If count &lt;= 25 Then lblQNum.Text = count txtQuestions.Text = (test(count-1).question) count += 1 Else : Messagebox.Show("done") End If End Sub
I see an assignment and code, but what's the question/issue?
Nothing happens when I select the calculate button.
I need to display 4 numbers so that each number is on its own line on the label rather than just one long line of the 4 numbers.
Lol left field? I think you mean line feed
You saw nossing.
Say the user selects a integer and its stores into number. I wanna output a review in a msgbox to display only the number of lines number has 
that depends on what you mean by "user enters -1". enters how? into what? 
Yes, thank you!
I get as far as Function ServiceandLabor() As Decimal and get an exception "Stackoverflow exception handled" message. 
I'm in this class .... This assignment is due at midnight and that all you got. Not looking so good 
Made any progress on this OP?
Working with databases requires some knowledge in programming as you have to be able to formulate queries as well as knowing how the system works. It's akin to building a computer with zero knowledge in computer science.
Thanks for the info, I was just reading about the MS "it just works" policy and glad to hear that.
you're not showing all the work, also showing some kind of docs for things you aren't using. what's testQuestion and does it have any non-fixed length strings, what's test(0) and why arne't you using qNumber, what's the actual error message.
a DBA that doesn't do any programming at all is really really rare and usually is just a sysadmin doing a small subset of what a DBA usually does within a team of actual DBAs, as the warm body that does the OS-related things DBAs don't like doing. you really don't want to be that guy since both DBAs and sysadmins treat that position as inferior.
What /u/cuddleslapine is saying would look something like this: strNumber = InputBox("Please enter a number between 1 and 10.", "Enter a number") For intStudyNumber = 1 To strNumber Next 
There is no actual error message. When I'm trying to read in the ExcelTest.dat file, it's not being stored in my array. testQuestion is a struct I put in a module. I tried using qnumber(x) but that also doesn't populate. So am I doing something wrong reading in my ExcelTest.dat? &amp;nbsp; Module Module1 Structure testQuestion &lt;VBFixedString(150)&gt; Public question As String &lt;VBFixedString(1)&gt; Public correctAnswer As String End Structure Public Const MaxNoOfQuestions = 25 Public test(MaxNoOfQuestions - 1) As testQuestion End Module -------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's all the code I really have. On my main forum I just have a combobox with values and a button to begin the test.
This was my attempt (Keep in mind, I am a novice as well): Private Sub ComboBox1_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles ComboBox1.SelectedIndexChanged If ComboBox1.Text = "Professional" Then ComboBox2.Items.Clear() ComboBox2.Items.Add("End User") ComboBox2.Items.Add("My Boss") ComboBox2.Items.Add("CEO") End Sub
Thanks for your attempt!
You could do two drop downs and make only one visible depending on what the first drop down selection is
This sounds like the perfect job for bit flagging, or at least a concept that is similar to it. Basically what bit flagging is, is instead of using whole bytes and values for stuff, you would use the individual bits of each byte as boolean values for certain things. An alternate derivative of this, would be to use values that are all powers of 2 to define each option in each dropdown menu. What this means, is that no matter what options you select, when the corresponding values of each option is added together, you will output a unique value identifying the exact choices chosen for your two dropdown boxes. So dropdown box one could have the following values: 1 2 4 8 16 And dropdown box 2 could have the following: 32 64 128 256 All you would need is three variables to make this all work. One variable is equal to the value of dropdown box one, the other would be the value of dropdown box two. Add them up together to get the final output solution. Say you select option 3 in dropdown box one, that would set the first variable to 4. Then you select option 2 in the second dropdown. This would set the second variable to 64, and adding the two together sets the final variable to 68, which you cannot get with any other combination. From there it's just setting the text area with a predetermined template based on each unique output value that you come up with. The best part is, you can use a select case to check on that final value to set your text area.
Small trivia for you today: The control, shift, and tab keys on your keyboard all function in this manner! It's how your computer knows if you're pressing those buttons separately, or together!
Thank you so much for the informational post! thought r/visualbasic was dead lol. Anyways, how do I implement MD6 into my SQLite database in Visual Basic. Also, I'm using Visual Basic 2010 Express, so am I using vb.NET or Visual Basic? I really dont want to install any software for the hashing, I want it to be pure efficient code.
I re-downloaded the data file and opened it to make sure it wasn't empty.. And it's not. So idk why it's not being stored. I'm trying to store the data (actual test questions) into the array either qNumber or test. &amp;nbsp; So qNumber(0) will have question 1, qNumber(1) would have question 2 and so on..
I still have VB6, Saved on my laptop. Because "If It ain't broken, It don't don't need fix'in."
Again, thank you soo much! Have you got an in depth tutorials on SQL in visual basic. Again, I'm looking for the best database for my project and no access! Preferably sqlite or mysql. Also, I want to code everything all by myself so no installing anything.
so to check for said variable intDatasys would i put IsNumeric(intDatasys)
Correct, it returns a boolean value of whether or not it's a numeric value.
thankyou!!!
Keep in mind that IsNumeric will be true if the number contains a ".", so if you truly want Integers only then it will still be true on Decimal / Single / Double data types.
(Assuming _152_ is the record count) You could try something like this: DataGridView2.DataSource = ds.Tables(0) ' Add a new column to you DGV [change name as desired] DataGridView2.Columns.Add("TotCount", "TotCount") ' Loop Rows to calculate from other column and add values to the new column For Each r As DataGridViewRow In DataGridView2.Rows r.Cells("TotCount").Value = DataGridView2.Rows.Count + r.Cells("IDKUPCA").Value Next If it just needs to pull the number from the TextBox you can just do something like: r.Cells("TotCount").Value = Val(TextBox1.Text) + r.Cells("IDKUPCA").Value
thank you ! It helped me a lot! 
&gt; IsNumeric(intDatasys) if IsNumeric(intDatasys) and intDatasys mod 1 = 0 then .... end if
I would personally avoid any use of legacy VB6 functions (anything in the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, such as IsNumeric). If you want to test against an entire string then Integer.TryParse is absolutely the way to go (or Single.Parse if you require decimals). If you just want to test a single character then you should be using Char.IsDigit.
1. You declared intFeet as a string. 2. You [formatted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k.aspx) intFeet as a percent. 3. You want [integer division](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0e16fywh.aspx) which is \ not [/](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/25bswc76.aspx). 4. You probably want to add code to display the remainder which would need the [modulus operator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/se0w9esz.aspx) 
that actually helped me. I'll get on it right now. When i get to class i'll post what i think is the right answer 
What is your teacher's email address so I can berate them for teaching you VB that is now 8 versions behind the current release... This is just stupid. Not worthy.... your teacher probably doesn't even know how to code in .NET.
Is the argument being passed the same variable type as the argument type specified?
when you don't specify datatypes in a function definition then it makes them variant, which is why you can't pass a string array by ref. I recommend adding Option Explicit (there's a IDE pref to set this by default) which will prevent this behavior and also will highlight any variable name typos.
I'm not exactly sure what your suggesting. Are you suggesting I put that inside my loop For i = 0 To noOfTablets - 1 FileGet(1, tablets(i)) Next i FileClose(1) If I put it there wouldn't it just display the same picture no matter what the index is? Or are you suggesting to declare a new dim as filename with the pictures location?
FileGet(1, "picture" &amp; i ) use string concatenation to build the file name...
if the file contents are the same I'd expect so
Alright, that helps a little bit. I understand what you are trying to do, I'm just still not entirely clear about some of the context of the information you're working with. * Where is the actual data that is in the `.dat` coming from? Could you just store the name of the image file to use in there, as well? Or does it come from an external source and you are just parsing it? * Are the images generic or are they unique for every item? (i.e., will all iPad Airs have the `ipadair.jpg` image?) If you have 1000 tablets, but only 20 different kinds, are you going to have 1000 different images? Or 20? --- The other thing I noticed: You should take the button `.Visible` checks out of the Select and do it by comparing `index` against the Upper and Lower bounds of the array: If tablets.GetLowerBounds(0) = index Then btn_previous.Visible = False btn_next.Visible = True ElseIf tablets.GetUpperBounds(0) = index Then btn_previous.Visible = True btn_next.Visible = False Else btn_previous.Visible = True btn_next.Visible = True End If (This is for VB.NET... I think the older VB uses `LBound(array)` and `UBound(array)`.) #&amp;nbsp; Also, this is just a personal preference, but if it were me, I'd use `.Enabled` instead of `.Visible`. It prevents the user from being able to actually use the button, but the button is still visible, just greyed out... it just gives a better visual indication to the user that "You can't do that, now" instead of the button just disappearing.
I guess for this instance the pictures would be unique. I have a Dell Venue8, iPad, iPad Air, Samsung Note 8, and a SurfacePro. So I'm thinking in terms of having 1000 different tablets that would each have their own unique image. &amp;nbsp; As for the .dat file, I'm pretty sure my professor just looked up the different specifications for the tablets and made the .dat file him self. He gave us the .dat file and the 5 pictures to put in our debug folder and told us to read in the .dat using FileOpen. If you were to open the file it looks similar to a .csv. So I don't think storing the pictures to the file is ideal or what he's looking for. If you take a look at the struct that was given for us to use, &amp;nbsp; &lt;VBFixedString(15)&gt; Public pictureFileName As String &amp;nbsp; is defined. So I'm assuming he wants us to store the location of the pictures there. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;nbsp; He gave us an example before where lets say you have a program displaying the 20 students, their average, and the class average. And to display the class average you wrote out class_average = average(1) + average(2)+ average(3) / 20.. and so on. If the number of students changed from 20 to 100, that code is going to be long and inefficient. That's what I'm trying to avoid with the tablet pictures if it's possible at all. Or is this just one of those instance where you have to individually define what pictures to use like I did with the select statement
Thanks for your feedback.
Welcome to the wonderful world of P versus NP. Computers are great at running through small(relatively) iterative loops of numbers. For the range of numbers you're looking for brute force will take ages. One simple optimization. Replace all your exponent operations with straight multiplication. For example, everywhere you have a^3 replace it with a * a * a. Do the same for b^3 and c^3. The exponential operation in VB is not very efficient whereas multiplication is a bit better. I would even declare three more variables and do the calculation only once per loop. dim aCubeVal, bCubeVal, cCubeVal as Ulong Do aCubeVal = a*a*a bCubeVal = b*b*b cCubeVal = c*c*c 
Forgive me for being so blunt and not offering any helpful suggestions. Why are you doing this in VB, when C or C++ would be altogether much, *much* faster?
C and C++ is *much*, **MUCH* faster than VB in just about every way. Considering your code here is essentially doing a lot of calculations and nothing extremely fancy, it would actually be relatively simple to convert it over to something in C or C++. Simplest method of seeing the speed difference is seeing how fast code in either language is able to count up to any ridiculously large number. You will quickly notice how fast C is compared to VB.
In fact it doesn't, just lights up the colors. The sounds would be cool though, this was just a small project I did. As I said this is my second week learning:)
You could use the Windows Beep API to create small brief tones for each square. That would certainly liven it up!
What you may be looking for is a Select Case statement. This will allow you to choose a series of actions based on the results of a single expression. (In your case, it would be lstColleges.SelectedItem) The thing with list boxes though, is they allow you to select multiple items within them. Are you sure this is an option you want to allow? If not, you may want to look at the ComboBox object. It only allows for selecting of a single option at a time.
You need to set your assignment of values above your if statement. Otherwise, dblUNCW will = 0 at the time of the calculation. Also, in your listbox you may have such entries as KU, NCSU, etc... In this case you would need to perform your If statement to check the selecteditems' .Text property If listbox.SelectedItem.Text = "NCSU" then 'perform your calculation That being said, this is very static. An alternative would be to create a college variable and assign each instance a name and cost. Add this object to the listbox so that you could just get the appropriate value directly from the selected item. Something like: Public Class College Public Name as String Public HourlyCost as Double Public Overrides Sub ToString() return Name End Sub End Class Now you could retrieve this information from a source outside your code and populate each instance of college from that external data source (ie, database, textfile, .csv, etc...) Loop code to retrieve external information Dim CollegeInstance as new College College.Name = {value from external source} College.HourlyCost = {value from external source} ListBoxOfColleges.Items.Add(CollegeInstance) End Loop Now you would have a list of OBJECTS that has all the information your need. Then you could use something like dim intHours as Integer = 10 SelectedCollegeCost = DirectCast(ListBoxOfColleges.SelectedItem, College).HourlyCost * intHours 
The i Mod 4 business is used to make sure every seed is unique to the string. Originally, strings like "age", "ega", "gae", "aeg", "gea", etc. would all return the same seed. So I set it to alter the seed, based on the position of each character in the string. It's not perfect, but it's good enough.
make a test case and share the code? one issue you'll have is that VB graphical elements are objects that use generic MFC classes internally. the classes have no useful info and the parent object just pushes what it needs in there. so depending on exactly what you're working with and what you're trying to do to it you'll likely have to use some other method. but you didn't say what methods you are using so...
Usually the order they are enumerated is always the same unless you do some funky dynamic control creation/deletion. So if you can't rely on class name, you should be able to go by child # (GetNextWindow loop),
Why can't you use notepad++? I am almost positive it has an installation option where it just installs under your profile, or I believe you can even install and run it from a USB key. No admin rights required.
You could use a for each but I'm thinking off the top of my head that it would work backward through the collection. For each t as textbox in yourForm.Controls.OfType(Of TextBox)() listbox1.item.add(t.text) Next That should at the very least get you started.
Maybe you could use a datagridview instead of the listbox and add them to each column. 
Depending on the size of your strings from the listbox, you could format them with VBTab at the end of each one. This would result in each of them being formatted according to their lengths and the width of the textbox.
IMO, the simplest way is to inspect the first character of each line as you loop the array, and see if it contains the opening bracket (you could also check the entire line if you know all of the section names). So replace this: count = 0 While readLines IsNot Nothing AndAlso count &lt; 20 RichTextBox1.Text = RichTextBox1.Text &amp; readLines(count) &amp; vbCrLf count += 1 End While with something like this: For Each line In readLines If line.StartsWith("[") Then 'you have a section, create a new array for this section Else 'you have a tag, add it to the current section End If Next 
This works kinda but do you know how I can advance the line so it reads the next one until it gets to my Do Until statement? Right now it just spams cat1 in the textbox because I cant figure out how to make it advance to the next line, lol. I'm still very new at all of this so it's a bit of a learning curve! Private Sub Button13_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button13.Click Dim textfile As String = My.Settings.Directory &amp; "\" &amp; ListBox1.SelectedItem If IO.File.Exists(textfile) Then readLines = IO.File.ReadAllLines(textfile) End If For Each line In readLines If line.Contains("[cat1]") Then Do Until line.Contains("[cat2]") RichTextBox1.Text = RichTextBox1.Text &amp; line &amp; vbCrLf Loop End If Next End Sub
Set your assignment, first. *Then* check if user_input is numeric. Don't do it all inside the if statement. 
[Here is where I'm at now](http://imgur.com/PTbxgSb). What statement can I write where if the user clicks the cancel button, it jumps out of the sub? Because when the IsNumeric runs, VB interprets cancel as a non numeric value so it jumps to the else and shows the msgbox"Please enter a numeric value"
 ElseIf user_input = "Cancel" Then Exit Sub Else (...)
Input box doesn't return "cancel" when cancelled. It returns empty, "" 
 User_input = inputbox(...) If user_input="" then exit sub If isnumeric...... 
Instead of using &gt;lblName.Text = txtName.Text You could use &gt;lblName.Text &amp;= txtName.Text This will add to the current text of the label instead of wiping it and displaying only what is currently in the textbox. I hope this helps!
aka string concatenation. 
Yup!
How does it split the lines into fields? 
depends on the database. you could use ADO, ADO EF, linq, or even a native DB specific library.
`strDrawing = Split(strRecord, ",")` https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6x627e5f(v=vs.90).aspx strDrawing is an array, so Split slices up the strRecord string by commas and puts each part in a element. however, there's an error in this code. strDrawing should be defined as `Dim strDrawing() as String` so that Split can dynamically allocate it based on what's in strRecord. making it fixed length prevents that (unless .net is different in this manner, I haven't tried doing that since vb6 which does not allow it). 
Thank's for your help!
How will I know what database im using?
To append something, use &amp;: Dim testString = "Blah blah blah" &amp; " blah" To add a new line, use vbcrlf: testString = testString &amp; vbCrlf 
well im currently learning this and im using microsoft sql as my databse
im pretty sure we're not suppose to use anything like that. I was given an example code that I don't quite understand where to use it
Yeah its for a project. This is a example code he said that he just googled. not sure how to format Private Shared Function GetConnectionString() As String Return "Provider=Micr osoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" _ &amp; "c:\temp\291datatabase.mdb" End Function Private Sub Findbtn_Click(sender As Ob ject, e As EventArgs) Handles Findbtn.Click Dim connectionString As String = GetConnectionString() Dim queryString As String = "SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM users where userID = " + Idtxt.Text.ToString Using connection As New OleDbConnection(connectionString) Dim command As Ol eDbCommand = connection.CreateCommand() command.CommandText = queryString Try connection.Open() Dim dataReader As OleDbDataReader = _ command.ExecuteReader() Do While dataReader.Read() Answer1.Text = dataReader(0).ToString Answer2.Text = dataReader(1).ToString Loop Answer1.Refresh() Answer2.Refresh() dataReader.Close() Catch ex As Exception Console.WriteLine(ex.Message) End Try End Using End Sub 
I don't know about this language (C#?), but in VB.Net you can put an expression behind your case, including an enumeration. switch (DirFirst) { case 0, 360: CarX1 = 0; CarY1 = 1; break; }
the "buffbills" part is can be done with modulus; If InputValue MOD 3 AND InputValue MOD 4 Then 'buffbills ElseIf InputValue MOD 3 Then 'buff ElseIf InputValue MOD 4 Then 'bills End If And for the checkbox-radiobutton relationship, I would use EventHandlers for the CheckBox, when the CheckBox is "CheckedChange', do some magic with the RadioButtons. On the FormDesigner view, you can find the Properties panel of the selected control at the right hand of the IDE (on default view of course), at the top you can find a lightning icon, there you can set event handlers http://imgur.com/d6lGqO4
 Private Shared Function GetConnectionString() As String Return "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" _ &amp; "c:\temp\291datatabase.mdb" End Function Private Sub Findbtn_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Findbtn.Click Dim connectionString As String = GetConnectionString() Dim queryString As String = "SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM users where userID = " + Idtxt.Text.ToString Using connection As New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection(connectionString) Dim command As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand = connection.CreateCommand() command.CommandText = queryString Try connection.Open() Dim dataReader As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataReader = _ command.ExecuteReader() Do While dataReader.Read() Answer1.Text = dataReader(0).ToString Answer2.Text = dataReader(1).ToString Loop Answer1.Refresh() Answer2.Refresh() dataReader.Close() Catch ex As Exception Console.WriteLine(ex.Message) End Try End Using End Sub I just formatted what you posted. Based on what you posted, it looks like you are connecting to an access database? Not SQL? I'm not entirely familiar with OLEDB, I haven't worked with it in awhile. Check out https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.oledb.oledbconnection\(v=vs.110\).aspx though. Looks like you need to tell it where your DB file actually is on your computer to connect to. Just replace "c:\temp\291datatabase.mdb" with wherever the file is. Also seems that you should have Answer1, Answer2 and Idtxt as textboxes on your form (guessing?) for user input, and the button Findbtn. You've got all the code to do it. Not sure what else you needed. 
0 degrees and 360 degrees are the same direction. You should use "DirFirst Mod 360" and "DirSecond Mod 360" to keep the values in the 0-359 range.
I would start by looking at what exactly you changed between it working and not working.
I would keep in mind that MS dropped XNA back in 2013 and there has been no further development on it since then. XNA apps won't run on the universal app platform. If you want to do newer game development for Windows, I would suggest adapting to that.
Since string.split returns an array I'm pretty sure it just blows away whatever was originally assigned to that variable, I don't think there is a bug here but you are still correct in how it should be written. Although as I'm on my phone I ha e no way of testing this right now but I'm pretty sure I'm right.
Well, I set my whole code in "comments" and started taking piece by piece back into my code. It turned out to be some kind of error regarding the My.Settings property. In the end I had to remove all the settings and transfered them into an .ini file. Thanks anyways!
You can also use a StringBuilder object, a little more convenient and memory efficient to build a string incrementally. It has the AppendLine method, which combines both operations.
on what? not everything has a property page...
I figured it out. I was trying to change the start up object in the design mode. I needed to click the main file in the solution explorer...
Try adding a webbrowser control and call a .navigate() on it to your XML file path. It does a good job with XML files because it will indent correctly and allow you to expand/collapse nodes.
Thanks for the reply! I think I overcomplicated it though when I was trying to explain, it even confused me a second time around reading it. To cut out all the unneeded information what I was originally trying to do is get specific pictures to display in a picturebox based on whatever is currently highlighted in the menu listbox. For example, if the menu had banana currently selected a picture of a banana would show in the picture box. If the user then clicked carrot in the menu a picture of a carrot would show instead. Something like that?
You create a variable to hold the sum and set it to zero. You then loop through all employees and add their individual gross pay to the total variable.
in an IE frame? yeah, that can steal focus even when hidden. IE is obnoxious. why use the browser object? just do the http yourself.
There are chrome extensions specifically made for refreshing a page periodically that you might be able to use.
Thank you! 
Functions return values. When you call a function, you have to set something equal to the function. Instead of CalcStayCharges lblTotalCost.Text = Try lblTotalCost.Text = CalcStayCharges Also instead of establishing your variables as class variables, it may be easier to read once you have larger classes if you establish these variables in whatever Sub you are using it in. So instead of putting "Dim intDaysAtHospital As Integer" at the top of your class, put that in your btnCalc_Click sub, and pass it to the function as a parameter, rather than a variable that will be kept after the code finished running. For this you'll need to change your function to Function CalcStayCharges(ByVal intDaysAtHospital as Integer) As Integer Then when you call the function you will pass the variable like lblTotalCost.Text = CalcStayCharges(intDaysAtHospital) Just woke up, so let me know if any of that was confusing.
Why are you wondering if it is happening because of the program asking strangers on the web when you could simply NOT run the program and see if the issue goes away? Why do people wonder about things they could easily test themselves?
Because that program goes to a website where I have to be online 24/7 with refreshing every hour, I can't just stop it and do that manually, thanks to Viper for making it all easier, now I'll have Chrome 24/7 instead of annoying ieframe :P
Sounds super shady, but glad you got an acceptable answer to your problem.
You are giving us nothing to work with. Have you even created the form? If you are this lost maybe you should ask your teacher for help and come back and ask more specific questions here.
What version of VB is this? VBA? VB6? VB.NETXXXX?
Forget about TextChanged. Use SelectedIndexChanged, which fires only when a selection is made. Let the ComboBox handle the partial matches by using the ComboBox properties AutoCompleteMode = Suggest and AutoCompleteSource = ListItems. Then just check the item that's selected and do your lookup from there. Does that help get you started?
start by breaking it into smaller pieces. make a detailed list of features (gui design, events handling, grab names as typed, proc to fetch data, populate list with data, clear list on invalid match), prioritized them based on dependencies (such as getting the typed name before calling a proc, and filling a the list before clearing it). then get started.
Just add a new form with the components that you need, and display it to get the input from the user. 
Don't forget to use the modal flag.
You might want to try a do while loop. While your text field is empty, ask for an input. If they don't enter anything, it will prompt them to enter something again, over and over and over until they actually enter data.
What's backing the DGV? If it's bound to classes then you could use Serialization (XML, binary, or JSON via json.NET) to save them to a file. You could also use EF to write the classes to SQL. 
Thanks for the info! 
 Environment.Newline.add("text here") And Environment.append("text here")
Yeah Posting some code would be nice. :) Its just for me and a few friends so idc if its the "dirty" code :D
Try googling "arrays in vb". We aren't here to do your homework for you
That seemed like a fun exercise (I wrote it in vba so I couldn't use "return True"), it should work as is in vb.net. Here is my try http://i.imgur.com/Oth70kZ.png
The "ToString" function is in pattern of Value.ToString() rather than ToString(String) But I don't know what that "C" is supposed to mean. If oyu want to concatenate it, do it this way: ListBox.Items.Add(Array(i).ToString() &amp; "C") Furthermore, You declared your arrays globally as String/Double Arrays. But in your output sub(as well as the others), you should keep it this way Sub Output(ByRef Type() As String, ByRef CurrentPrice() As Doube, ByRef IncreasePrice() As Double)
In visual studio 10 i had this toolbar which allowed to quickly create the form close, minimize etc. events. It disappeared in 2015 and i want it back... i've search for hours and can't find a way to activate it :(
The following SO question shows how to get it back. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1441207/class-name-and-method-name-dropdown-list-is-missing-visual-studio-setting
"C" is the "Standard Numeric Format String" for currency: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k%28v=vs.110%29.aspx edit: pasted wrong link
First things ... start by setting "Option Strict On" (preferably globally in Visual Studio, but at least at the top of the form, before the public Class declaration). This will ensure that VB isn't making any assumptions about what you intend, and will force you to be a bit more specific with some code. As DatMarv pointed out, you'll have better success passing the correct type to the functions, and once you have option strict turned on, you'll have to clean up a couple of missing declarations (that will help clean up your issues). Here's a cleaned up version of IncreasePrice: Function IncreasePrice(ByRef CurrentPrice() As Double, ByRef PriceIncrease() As Double) As Double() Dim Size = 0 Dim NewPrice(Size) As Double For Position = 0 To Size NewPrice(Position) = CurrentPrice(Position) + PriceIncrease(Position) Next Return NewPrice End Function The major changes: * The passed values are now arrays of Double, not "Arrays", and it has a return value specified as an array of Double * NewPrice is now declared as an array of Double (it was missing the type assignment) * The Return line is returning the entire NewPrice array, instead of the last item in the array (by including the Size index in the return statement, you were only returning a single item). The currency formatting looks correct, so I'd see how Option Strict helps with the formatting. 
I also just noticed that you are declaring size as 0, so you are never actually looping the Current price / Price increase arrays. You'd ideally set that to the lower count of either CurrentPrice, or PriceIncrease.
you just put () after the var name and that makes it an uninitialized array. you can put a number in the () to initialize, or use some other processes to populate and initialize. the specific syntax varies by VB version and datatype. 
As chrwei said () after a variable is an array So you can dim myarray(3,3) gives you your 3 x 3 grid (actually 4 x 4 because 0 is a valid number)
For a 1-dimensional array: Dim MyArray() As Integer = {1,3,5,7,9} ' Access [GET/SET] values by index - Example: MyArray(1) = 3 For a multi-dimensional array: Dim MyArray(2, 2) As Integer ' 3 x 3 [X/Y Grid] ' Access [GET/SET] values by coordinate [X/Y Index] - Example: MyArray(0,1) = 3 Note: You can use other data types as well. Example: Dim MyArray() As String = {"chicken", "cow", "moose"} MsgBox(MyArray(1)) ' Output = cow

Why would one write code and then create pseudocode from it? That is the opposite purpose of pseudocode. The whole point of pseudocode is to outline your logic so that you can then properly write the actual code. Are you sure you weren't given this code and your task is to convert it to pseudocode?
When everything drops, what are you putting in the textbox? When nothing drops, what are you putting, and does the exception get flagged? When the correct row is dropped, but isn't removed, what do you mean it is not removed? What you described with many different things happening from what was expected sounds like you need to debug the program and see what is happening. I'm not sure if it would make a difference or not, but I think your .ExecuteReader should be .ExecuteNonQuery.
I tried that executenonquery and it worked in the sense that the correct id's were being recognized, but the messagebox would pop up and when I refresh the sql tables the row with the id is still there. so for example with the execute reader if i have a row of id 555 under patientID it would "patient removed" with any value, but not remove it even if i put in 555
You should never, ever write code like this. I could put text in the IDText textbox that would delete your entire database when you code like this. You should be using parameters, not string concatenation to make SQL strings.
Yeah my teacher wants me to convert the code into pseudocode
What parameters? I can't even get anything to drop. Just the message box to pop up
ok, well in that case the above code should prove useful to you to validate the user input before trying to run the query by making sure the textbox isn't empty and is a valid integer.
You'll have to post some code, so that we can see how you are using this. 
ah okay! Thanks for correcting me
I'm not exactly sure I'm following but if you mean, for example, you might delete 10000 from under Nissan Maxima and add back in 12500 it would still be a value for Nissan Maxima but it would go to the end of the listbox (under the 40000). This will be very troublesome to do if that is what you're getting at. My question to you is: **How do you know what each of the entries represent after a user has added and removed various values?** You could however append the listindex from the main listbox for each item you add back. For example in the demo you gave it would show 0~Nissan 0~Maxima 0~2009 0~10,000 1~Hyundai 1~Accent 1~2009 1~6,000 2~Kia 2~Optima 2~2006 2~3,000 3~Nissan 3~Pathfinder 3~2014 3~40,000 Then when you edit it would place the listindex &amp; ~ and the value so that this way you could loop through the list and find anything that is associated with that listindex. HOWEVER, it get's trickier as a user could remove two items and add them back in opposite order at which point you are once again lost as to what value is what. So please answer my question I posed as without that information, this would be tricky to do with 2 listboxes and not using any custom objects (which would save you a tremendous amount of code and work)
IF statements take non-zero or "true" as true. x=true returns true, so this is redundant

Erm, from a relational database standpoint, you would be setting up relationships between individual movies and individual actors. Take the following for instance: You want to track each movie. Within each movie, you will have different actors for each movie. To track this, you need an entry for each actor so that you can establish a relationship with the actors to their corresponding movies. Now the fun part, is establishing the relationships themselves. You'll need an entry for each relationship that has a Movie ID number, as well as an Actor ID number. What this does, is tie each movie and actor together, so that you can search for either field of data. These would be the "pointers" you mentioned. Now to tie all of these into your VBA project, you will be working mostly with these relationships versus the movies and actors themselves. When you are choosing an actor from the first combobox, you will be looking at all of these relationships for any that are linked to your actor's ID number. And from that information, you can pull up the movie info. When selecting a movie from the second page, you are simply looking up all linked relationships that contain that movie's ID number, and listing the actor names that are tied to them. Now the third page is slightly different, but still fits into this system I have described above. It's essentially allowing you to add to your relationship tables to add more information to them. When you select your actor, you will have to look up their ID number. From there, you can create a new movie entry, and a new relationship entry. The movie entry generates a unique ID number for that movie and has the movie's name. The relationship entry generates a unique ID and the corresponding IDs of the movie and actor. Now when you look up by that particular movie or actor, you will now be able to view your data fairly easily. If you don't mind posting your code, I can help you with that. I'm not keen on downloading macro enabled spreadsheets from sources I do not normally work with.
First: Nice! I didnt know about CBool, it actually comes in handy here! Second: I still don't know how to extract the data from my SQL Server... :( Thanks!

Oh, and thank you so much for your response.
Thanks again for your response, it's clearly a lot easier with the tables that you propose, sadly i'm not allowed to create tables, I have to use the tables that are given to me, even if they complicate the things and doesn't let tag movies with more than one genre. I really like how you put it, it's a lot better, but I can't use those tables :(. So the problem persist, how to add movie entries to that tables and keep the pointer thing working. I wish I could give you something more than an upvote for that response, really thank you, dude.
Aaahhh that's so lame. Just have to figure out what the pointers are pointing to. Right now I can't really make sense of what they are being used for.
Notice in the event handler subs there are 2 parameters passed in, sender and e. Sender is the control that raised the event, so it will be the button that was clicked. However, it's passed to the sub as an Object, so you'll have to cast it as a Button before you can change the properties of it: DirectCast(sender, Button).Text = "text" So you just need to pass sender on to your blue() sub so that blue() has access to it. Also, so you know, you can have a single event handler handle multiple events (from the same control or multiple controls) by comma separating the events after "Handles", like so: Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click, Button2.Click
look at some of the properties that the timespan gives Typically if someone is looking for how many minutes the would use the minutes property of the timespan If strTimeLeft.Minutes &lt; 60 then Not at a machine with vb.net right now and haven't messed with the timespan class in quite a while so I may be a little off base.
Thank you! I will look into this next.
You lost me here &gt;What I am trying to figure out is if either of the 2 possible Error MessageBoxes happen I do not want the initial MB you receive on button click to show up. It should only show up if the other 2 MB's do not.&lt; If you don't want the original message box to pop up, I assume it not an error message. So set the other two to catch improper input. You can use a Try Catch or an Else If
A simple way would be to clear the listview and reload the file while skipping all the lines that don't match your employee name. I don't know if you can change your title, but what you want is "Filter a Listview", not "Sorting a comma..." 
Change the order of the MsgBoxes. Do the "error" ones first and "Exit sub" after each (or as necessary). Something like this: Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click If error1 Then MsgBox("Error 1") Exit Sub End If If error2 Then MsgBox("Error 2") Exit Sub End If MsgBox("No Errors") End Sub If that doesn't help, post some code (indent all lines 4 spaces to have it show up cleanly on reddit) so that we can better understand what you're doing.
Thanks for your help I tried both what you and /u/TheFotty suggested and this is the result. ( this is compressed to make viewing easier ) If txtNameLine.Text = "" Then MessageBox.Show("Error1") End If If (radLemonade.Checked = False) Or (radSierraMist.Checked = False) Or (radDrPepper.Checked = False) Or(radDietPepsi.Checked = False) Or (radTeaSouth.Checked = False) Or (radTeaNorth.Checked = False) Or (radMtnDew.Checked = False) Or (radRootBeer.Checked = False) Or (radWater.Checked = False) Or (radPepsi.Checked =False) Or (radOtherDrinks.Checked = False) Then MessageBox.Show("Error2") End If If txtNameLine.Text = "" And (radLemonade.Checked = True) Or (radSierraMist.Checked = True) Or (radDrPepper.Checked = True) Or (radDietPepsi.Checked = True) Or (radTeaSouth.Checked = True) Or (radTeaNorth.Checked = True) Or (radMtnDew.Checked = True) Or (radRootBeer.Checked = True) Or (radWater.Checked = True) Or (radPepsi.Checked = True) Or (radOtherDrinks.Checked = True) Then Else If Not txtNameLine.Text = "" And (radLemonade.Checked = True) Or (radSierraMist.Checked = True) Or (radDrPepper.Checked = True) Or (radDietPepsi.Checked = True) Or (radTeaSouth.Checked = True) Or (radTeaNorth.Checked = True) Or (radMtnDew.Checked = True) Or (radRootBeer.Checked = True) Or (radWater.Checked = True) Or Not (radPepsi.Checked = True) Or (radOtherDrinks.Checked = True) Then MessageBox.Show("NoError") End If End If Hopefully this is easy to read tried to follow the indent thing. ATM If the First IF and 2nd IF are true meaning there is nothing in txtNameLine and all radio buttons are off then all 3 message boxes happen. All I'm trying to do is this - First IF is true then give Error1 - Second IF is true then give Error2 - First+Second is true then give both Error1+2 - If EITHER first or second is true then do NOT give NoError - Only give NoError if NEITHER first or second is true 
Declare the InputBox first, before setting its' content to be added to the listbox1. Once you've declared the InputBox, just determine if it has x with something like If InStr(InputBoxString, "X", CompareMethod.Text) &gt; 0 Then 'Don't add content to listbox Blah Else 'Add content to listbox Blah End If
Thank you! Now how would I get the InputBox to close when "x" is imputed?
Thank you!
You can put a flag to indicate that an error occurred. Set the flag when you get either error and exit before showing "no error" if the flag is set. Dim gotError As Boolean = False ' our Heroic Flag is created If ... MessageBox.Show("Error1") gotError = True If ... MessageBox.Show("Error2") gotError = True If gotError Then Exit Sub ...show no error...
If input = "x" or "X" then Exit For Sorry bout the formatting. 
Do your own homework. You just are copy/pasting the question. You have given zero effort and want someone to do your homework for you. Maybe you deserve the F.
What were you having trouble with? This looks like it might be a final for a class, but you didn't ask any questions.
no shit I want the same thing as they aren't any answers to it 
Good. There shouldn't be answers to homework just sitting on the internet for you to copy/paste and hand in as your own work. Do your own homework. This sub is willing to help those that put effort in and need help with specific things. It looks to me like you did nothing and just want the assignment completed for you and handed to you on a platter. Sorry but that isn't going to happen, and would not help you to learn anything.
yes my bad. Windows (8,10 i am assuming they are similar) events.
Really tired, maybe this actually means the windows event logs. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k6b9a7h8(v=vs.90).aspx Could you just run a timer, save the last few entries or an entry count, when there is a new entry, read it and do whatever based on it? Basically once you read the file, do what you need based on the first entry and periodically read the file? There is also a FileSystemWatcher object you could use and point at each security event log file. When the watcher fires an event saying the file was modified you could then read it and see if it was changed / what was added / do your logic based on what was added. (I don't know if you knew or not but these are actually files in your windows directory.) example: c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs\security.evtx for winXP etc. it is in the same location(?) and is named something slightly different like WinSec.evt or something I forgot the name exactly :*(

At work we are not allowed to utilize any 3rd party add-ins so I needed to find a solution to Outlook's missing alerts on a shared inbox. I explored having 2 exchange accounts logged into the same client and while the alerts were a nice benefit, the inability to modify rules and the cluttering of my calendar and tasks list were not worth the benefit. I was unable to find this solution in any of my searches but instead patched together the solutions people have found to entirely different problems. I thought it might be valuable for others who have found themselves in my position. How the program works: in the ThisSession module on the application start we define an outlook.items object that has events. This allows the program to act whenever a new item is added to this collection. in the items_add(Item as object) event we check if the item is actually mail and not an event or task or another object that might cause an error. If the object is a mail item then we create a userform and then call the ShowForm method of that object. Since VBA doesn't allow for overloaded methods, this is acting as the show method for this form. Within the frx file there are a series of WindowsAPI calls(learning how these work was probably the most interesting part of this project). The API calls we have here are: [FindWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633499\(v=vs.85\).aspx), this will look though all open windows and check the information in the title bar and the window type for a matching window and returns a numeric value that identifies the "Window Handle". A window handle is a unique identifier that for each window that is instance dependent, meaning that each session the window will have a different id. [GetDesktopWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633504\(v=vs.85\).aspx), this gets the handle for the desktop. [GetWindowLong](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633584\(v=vs.85\).aspx), this gets the numeric value for one of the properties of a window that are stored in memory. The parameters that it takes are the window's handle and the location of a property [SetWindowLongA](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633591\(v=vs.85\).aspx), This changes the value of a property of a window that is stored in memory. This takes parameters: Window handle for the window you want to update, the location of the property you want to change and the new value for that property. [SetWindowPos](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633545\(v=vs.85\).aspx), this method sets up the window's x, y and z position, the width and height, and the window style elements. This takes parameters of the window handle of the window you want to change, the window handle of the window you want to be right behind it, the x and y locations, the width and height, and the flags. Flags are window style elements and overrides that apply to the method itself (more on this later). The constants hold the userform's parent windows handle, the location of the border property, the flag constants, and the topmost window constant. There is a global variable that hold our window's handle and one to hold the mailItem that we are using to create the form. The ShowForm method, as I said above, acts as an override to the show method of the userform, it takes in an outlook mail item. This first sets our labels to display the correct information. It then sets the hwnd variable with the window's handle value. It then updates the parent of the userwindow to be that of the desktop, this allow the window to exist outside of our outlook program (this may not be required at this point but was part of a previous solution). It then get the value for the window style and update it to not have a border or a title bar. Next it increases the inner size of the window to account for the new empty space. and then sets the window position to be on top of all other windows, using the Flags that were defined above. The flags I am using are as follows: SWP_NOSIZE, this ignores the size variables that you entered into the SetWindowPos method. SWP_NOMOVE = &amp;H2, this ignores the x and y position parameters passed to SetWindowPos. SWP_NOACTIVATE, this will prevent the window from becoming the active window. This is important because we don't want to take the user out of whatever they are doing. If we knew the user was going to be in a controlled state there might be another solution but since emails can come at any time this is a better solution. SWP_SHOWWINDOW, this will make the form visible. Including this in the flags removes the requirement of using the show method, which allows us to avoid activating the form, since userforms show method by default makes the form the activate application within windows. After the form is made visible we call on the wait method before unloading the form itself. The wait method is relatively simple, it uses a do loop and checks the now function to see what time it is. When now matches the time it was called plus the number of seconds passed to it if will then move out of the method. The DoEvents method frees the thread to allow for other actions while this method is happening. the showmsg method will show the mail item from the form in an outlook inspector, this is used in both the click and double click event of the form. 
It's a database with members,horses,races, and racetracks, I don't know but I managed to get it to work eventually (i used the SQL syntax during my base load so it could open then, I guess that was sufficient)
ds is just the instance of the dataset, in your code you would change this to your dataset instance. Tables() is a collection of tables contained in the dataset so in my example, I am using the first table that the collection holds. index 0. You may have to change this if you have more than one table in your dataset. You should also be able to reference the table by name if memory serves me correctly so if you were using table Employees you should be able to use &lt;your dataset&gt;.Tables("Employees").DefaultView... 
you could maybe pipe it to an online converter, or use a call out to ghostscript
I don't see that you're adding to intCount in your loop, so its value will remain at 0, which makes the loop go on forever. Add intCount +=1 before your Next statement, and that should make your outer loop function correctly. edit: Your inner loop will suffer from the same problem, and that might be causing part of your larger problem.
Do you know how to set breakpoints and step through code? If so, you should set them and set some watch variables and see the code in action as it is executing line by line instead of making changes, running it again, and scratching your head as to why it might be doing something or not doing something. If you don't know about how to do this debugging, just say so, and we will get you started.
It looks like you're setting the 4 indices of the first array each with a random number between 1 and 50, and the second 4 with random numbers between 1 and 4. When you're debugging, you can type variables into the Watch Window and view their values at each step. That might help you see what two integers are being compared when you're attempting to set your boolean to true.
Nothing is being converted to boolean. All that code is doing is checking to see if tbCode.Text is either "Ryan" or "Austen". If it's Ryan, it will display days as Mon, Tues, Wed and AM. If it's Austen, it will display days as Thurs, Fri, Sat, and shift as PM. If it's neither Ryan or Austen, it will say Invalid login. Also, you might want to check on that OR statement. ElseIf tbCode.Text &lt;&gt; "Ryan" Or tbCode.Text &lt;&gt; "Austen" Then 
No after the Or statement the compiler is crapping out because "Austen" is not Boolean as you can only have Boolean values in an If statement. I So it might be saying an error message if something like string cannot convert to or isnt Boolean value. Which is where the confusion comes from. 
 numberstxt.Text = dblone.ToString &amp; dbltwo.ToString &amp; dblthree.ToString You'll want to insert spacing, or make it a multiline textbox and insert vbnewline characters to have each one appear on a new line. numberstxt.Text = dblone.ToString &amp; vbNewLine &amp; dbltwo.ToString &amp; vbNewLine &amp; dblthree.ToString Or you can also make use of the Append method for any string.
How would I insert spacing?
&gt; It works! Thank you!
You just need to put an if then statement in the change sub for your option (radio) buttons that make the combo box visible if the correct one is a true value. You can use properties to make the combo box default visible = false and then if the yes option (radio) button value is true then combo box visible = true. See the example below: Private Sub OptionButton1_Change() If OptionButton1.Value = True Then ComboBox1.Visible = True Else ComboBox1.Visible = False End If End Sub 
&gt; Private Sub OptionButton1_Change() hmmmm I must be missing something because look : https://imgur.com/VLFnJcy

Just do if instead of elseif on the first if.
THANK YOUU IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY :D
so use the debugger and step through to see where it's not doing what you want. you have a lot going on here, and very little of it following "best practice", such as arrays, data structures, multiple records in a file, etc. this makes it very difficult to read the code and spot what exactly is wrong you might even try just starting over from scratch and making it work for only 1 password first, then add more.
There appear to be countless copy and paste errors throughout the code. Username**1** = **objReader**.ReadToEnd objReader.Close() Username**2** = **objReader1**.ReadToEnd objReader.Close() Username**3** = **objReader**.ReadToEnd objReader.Close() If Username**1** = "adsadsadsadgdbggf" And Password**1** = "dsadkjn fjbiujgfgbmflkvmg" Then Username**1** = newName Password**3** = newPass And so on. To help avoid these kinds of mistakes, try to reduce code duplication by moving repeated code into reusable methods, and define constants (e.g. the file paths and default values) in one place instead of multiple possibly inconsistent places.
I also highly recommend not storing user information in plain text. Hash your information and save the hashes.
1) Your total and meal variables are redundant. 2) Your multiplication by 1 does nothing 3) You are reassigning a value to meal for each of the checked checkboxes, instead of adding them. If someone checks all 3 options, you need to add them all together. if chkBreakfast.Checked then Meal += Breakfast end if if chkLunch.Checked then Meal += Lunch end if if chkDinner.Checked then Meal += Dinner End if lblTotalPrice.text = meal.tostring Also meal should have a default value of 0 not 1.
Oh ok thank you i am kind of new ti the whole coding thing lol but thank you like seriously that helped a lot 
just add in a: listbox1.items.add("Heads") on the line after headslabel.text or listbox1.items.add("Tails") on the line after tailslabel.text
thank you
Read the question again. He wants to clear lstZip out and then re-fill it. The problem is that he separated this between two events that trigger off of the same action. What he wants to happen is happening, just in the wrong order. The .click event gets handled first, so it adds the zips to the list *before* the .textchanged event is handled.
I would use different events. And change a bit on the structure. I would store the ZIP codes in a Dictionary. Like this: Dim CitiesAndZipcodes As New Dictionary(Of String, String()) In this case, the CitiesAndZipcodes will store everything, and it's ready when you want to use. Note: you will have to fill the value at Form Load, like this: CitiesAndZipcodes.Add("Budapest", New String("1053", "1057", [...]) ComboBox1 SelectedIndexChange: ComboBox2.Clear For Each val As String In CitiesAndZipcodes(Combobox1.SelectedItem.ToString) ComboVox2.Items.Add(val) Next Uhm, I hope you understand it... 
This is a nightmare to debug because you're manually setting and resetting the pictures. It's hard to say where the mistake is without going through the debugger line by line (i.e. by inserting a breakpoint into your code and hitting F8 to go through the code), but that is honestly a very inefficient way to code something like this. I know you said you haven't covered arrays, but consider looking up how they work and then add your buttons and pictures into a list/array. You can simplify that gigantic code into modular sections that read like this: Private Sub Button10_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button10.Click For Each pic in picList pic.Visible = False Next picList(catwoman).Visible = True End Sub
Use a TextBox or an InputBox
uh, sure?
first, ew, but sounds like a step in learning. second, what kind of card game. third, take your own stab at your homework first, then ask specific questions.
You should just be able to set the DTPicker value with some concatenation. DTPicker1.Value = CDate("01/01" &amp; Year(Now)) It's been a while since I've messed with VBA but I think this should set the date in the datetimepicker to 01/01/2015. If you have set a year value somewhere that you want to use instead of the current year, I would think you could just build the string from that DTPicker1.Value = CDate("01/01" &amp; YourVariableThatHoldsTheYearYouWant) As you can see here we can cast a string to a date when properly formatted (CDate) so by building that proper string and casting it to a date, you should be able to pass it into the DTPicker's value property to get the desired effect.
Agree completely, but we get a lot of them posting here. Mostly seems to be high school / secondary school students, and I'd guess it's what the teacher knows, or has a curriculum for. 
hmmmm my code looks like this for now, where to plug this??: Private Sub StartDate_Change() Dim emptyRow As Long 'Submits the date in the first empty row immediately since the form does not retain datepicker data after the page changes. Sheet1.Activate emptyRow = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range("A:A")) + 1 Cells(emptyRow, 18).Value = StartDate.Value End Sub
So if you're wanting this to happen before prompting then you would probably put it into the forms Activate event or an event that would be triggered prior to the user needing the DTP. All you would be doing in that event is setting the DTP to the date you want to display. 
Yes exactly! So it's possible to have the calendar toggle to a date before the person clicking on it?
I answered my own question and found a way to fix: Option Strict On Public Class frmGrades Private Sub btnCalculate_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click ' Declare the variables to hold values. Dim StudentGrade As Integer Dim Total As Integer = 0 Dim Average As Integer Dim strInputName As String Dim strInputGrades As String Dim intCountName As Integer = 0 Dim Grade As String = String.Empty Dim OUT As String = String.Empty Dim ValidFields As Boolean Dim Variable As Integer Do While intCountName &lt; 3 Do ' First get the name of the student whom grades are being averaged. strInputName = InputBox("Enter the name of a student to average three grades") If strInputName = String.Empty Then MessageBox.Show(" Please enter an alphebetical name") ValidFields = False ElseIf Integer.TryParse(strInputName, Variable) Then MessageBox.Show(" The name entered cannot be a number") ValidFields = False Else OUT = strInputName ValidFields = True End If Loop Until ValidFields = True For intCountScore As Integer = 1 To 3 Step 1 Do ' Convert the user input and verify if it is a numeric whole number. strInputGrades = InputBox(" Please enter the whole number of a score ") If Not Integer.TryParse(strInputGrades, StudentGrade) Then MessageBox.Show(" Please Enter a numeric value that is postive") ValidFields = False ElseIf StudentGrade &lt; 0 Or StudentGrade &gt; 100 Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter a grade between 0-100") ValidFields = False Else StudentGrade = CInt(strInputGrades) Total += StudentGrade ValidFields = True End If Loop Until ValidFields = True Next Average = CInt((Total / 3)) ' Add each score to a total and add one to the score counter. ' Find the letter grade recieved. If Average &lt; 60 Then Grade = " E" ElseIf Average &lt; 70 Then Grade = " D" ElseIf Average &lt; 80 Then Grade = " C" ElseIf Average &lt; 90 Then Grade = " B" ElseIf Average &lt;= 100 Then Grade = " A" End If lstOutput.Items.Add(OUT &amp; " " &amp; "Average " &amp; Average.ToString &amp; ": Letter Grade is " &amp; Grade) Total = 0 OUT = String.Empty intCountName += 1 Loop End Sub 
Yes, as I've shown. You will need to find an event that will let you set it prior to needing it. As you stated above, you want to get the year from a prior field in the userform. For example. Let's say you have a textbox where the user enters the year. You could put your code in the Exit event of the textbox that sets the DTP from the year entered in the textbox. Private Sub TextBox1_Exit(ByVal Cancel As MSForms.ReturnBoolean) 'Take the year from the textbox and append it to 01/01/ and 'set the DTP to that date. DTPicker1.Value = CDate("01/01/" &amp; TextBox1.Text) End Sub Of course, the example above does not ensure that a proper year or even a year at all is entered so you would need to check to ensure that the entry is correct or your application will crash if CDate cannot parse the string to a proper date.
Edits were to fix the formatting* Just a regular one line textbox? I suppose that you could append the name of each file and use a delimiter of some sort. Dim directory = txtDirectory.Text Dim files() As System.IO.FileInfo Dim dirinfo As New System.IO.DirectoryInfo(directory) files = dirinfo.GetFiles("*", IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories) For Each file In files TextBox1.Text = TextBox1.Text &amp; "," &amp; file.Name.ToString Next If you don't want the comma, just delete that part out.
There is no error message, the cursor just changes into the working one and nothing pops up
What type of application is it? Windows Forms? WPF? Console app? What does the first bit of code that runs when the application is started look like?
Its a Windows Forms On the first form? It's a simple progressbar with a timer to simulate a loading Public Class Form1 Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick ProgressBar1.Increment(10) If ProgressBar1.Value = 100 Then Me.Hide() login.Show() Timer1.Enabled = False End If End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load End Sub End Class 
I would think you could set the .SelectedPath property and have that folder hilighted.
Just tried and I got the same result, plus I noticed something, Vb won't let me debug/release until I restart the pc, because there is a process using the project Items, that process is the .exe that never show up
Well, I just tried creating another Form, and the same thing happened, looks like there's something wrong with my pc...
We are currently doing VB6 in my course I was wondering if you guys can think of any 2 player games that can be programmed?
It would be whatever the name of your exe is. DatabaseManager.exe if that is what you called it for example, should be found in the task manager under running processes. That is, this should be the case when you try to rebuild but it tells you it can't because files are in use.
 Case Is = "Example Command" means you're already comparing to a string, so how are you doing that...
All the commands are also in a text document, so it just pulls them from there. Is that what you mean?
show us your login code 
you only showed part of the code, and I don't know the api you're using so...
As long as I know, it would be W10 as Vb Community 2015
got it already.. only needs to stream the image on each pictureboxes Dim fs As System.IO.FileStream ' Specify a valid picture file path on your computer. fs = New System.IO.FileStream("C:\WINNT\Web\Wallpaper\Fly Away.jpg", IO.FileMode.Open, IO.FileAccess.Read) PictureBox1.Image = System.Drawing.Image.FromStream(fs) fs.Close()
Yes! This worked :)! Thank you!
how do you code a CB to ignore it's own index? the check is performed within the CB itself.
CB code: if txt.text = "" then msgbox("Error") exit sub else 'perform code for CB.selectedindexchange end if Clear button Code: cb.selectedindex = -1 when the clear button is pressed, the cb is cleared, but the msgbox activates.
[url=http://imgur.com/SeSqkeT](http://i.imgur.com/SeSqkeT.png) maybe this will help, I apologize, I can't get the code formatting to work properly.
No problem.
Not fully understanding the code and the events involved, you could probably just set a global boolean to the class dim isClearFromButton as boolean = False then do an if not isClearFromButton Your code for checking and calculating isClearFromButton = False End if In your clear button make sure to set isClearFromButton = True This would set the boolean to true so that in your change event, your code would only process if the boolean is false which it wouldn't be upon hitting the clear button. There's probably a more elegant way of doing this but without seeing the event code driving everything this seems likely since the moment you clear the combobox the selected index changes and that even is retriggered. 
I should be banging my head on a rock. The simple stuff is always the furthest from my mind. In the clear button, I simply moved the CB.clear line to the top (making it activate before performing any other clear on the form). It still checks for the error, but what was happening before was that the check was clearing and then running a second check then throwing an error.
Ok we are going to move the img_list to the global. 
No problem!
Have you tried performing this without closing the first workbook?
After copying the data from the test1 workbook and moving back to the tracker.xlsm workbook add Range("A1").select So you select the range you're pasting into. Then after everything is copied over reactivate the test1 workbook and use the activeworkbook.close line there to close the workbook you're copying from If that doesn't work let me know
The operator itself is called %. Or mod. Modulus is the result of a modulo operation.
I would assume that "Design an attractive form with company logo and appropriate objects" means it would have fields for each value, not just a big text box. then you'd make a sub, much like your "report" sub that populates the fields.
Ah, you could practically copy all the code from the button into its own sub, and call that sub from your button. The image you posted of your code appears to be old stuff considering the button has no loops within it.
I changed a few things but I think that may be the change that made it work. Thank you!
Yea sorry I'll post my old code and without the sub doing the loops in about 40 mins I just got out of work. Thank you for the help though. It means alot.
I think I had done that, and it didn't work. It said sub was not producing a value, and this is why Im stuck now lol
Post code!
Check your If statement nesting. In pseudocode, it reads to me as: If any topping is checked, then do nothing Otherwise, if lettuce is checked, then add it as a topping Otherwise, if tomato is checked, then add it as a topping It would seem you don't want the ElseIf because that enforces the "otherwise" logic. A bunch of simple If statements one after another would suffice, especially since I fancy both lettuce and tomato on my burger (so don't stop at lettuce... keep trying all the checkboxes). Only one radio button in a group box can be selected, but checkboxes are independent of each other even when in a group box.
Forgot to mention this is in visual basic 2013. The problem i have is checking the answer, and if the user input answer matches x+y is true. Then display in a label if it is correct, if not display false.
Err the problem is, the program won't build after code for thr button to check the answer. Trying to figure out what would be the correct way to have it check the user inputted answer. (Edit) i fixed the true and false portions but still wont build
Try checking your logic and the scope of intx and inty in the program + what's the error when you try to build the program? (As these are the only two issues i see with your code so far)
Does this help at all (remove boolean and remove other if and declare intx and inty outside of sub): &gt; If intxNumber + intyNumber = intAnswer 'if it does equal lblMessage.Text = "Correct" Else 'if it doesn't equal lblMessage.Text = "Incorrect" End If Edit: this worked for me module stuff Dim intXNumber As Integer Dim intYNumber As Integer sub main() Dim rand As New Random 'Random number from 0-500 intXNumber = rand.Next(500) intYNumber = rand.Next(500) 'prints random generated numbers console.writeline(intXNumber) console.writeline(intYNumber) two() end sub sub two() dim intAnswer as Integer console.writeline("Enter an answer") intAnswer = console.readline() If intxNumber + intyNumber = intAnswer 'if it does equal console.writeline("Correct") Else 'if it doesn't equal console.writeline("Incorrect") End If end sub End module obviously you will change console.writeline and readline to write to a textbox and read from the textbox.
Hm same thing but everything shows up as correct. This is the code i have with that Pastebin.com/jAv6Y4jF
For starters, report isn't returning anything because it's not a function. That's why calling it and passing variables doesn't do anything. In addition to that, you are passing variables that do not contain information to it from your button. If you look at the variables being passed, you declare them initially in your button. They haven't been assigned any values yet.
Thanks a lot!
Did you declare it? Dim Random As New System.Random I believe that's the syntax for it. "Random" Is the name of the generator, and you can change it to anything you want
Thank you! Just went back through work I'd been set in class and yep-that was the bit I forgot. Now, can I actually do work in class rather than wait for everyone to catch up?
In your project properties on the application tab is a setting for shutdown mode. The options allow for * When startup form closes * When last form closes One of these must occur to stop the application. If you are hiding various forms or the startup form itself then you may want to set up a routine that loops through the application's forms collection and ensures that they all get closed. 
Could you explain further?
Works perfectly, thanks!
If it's just a matter of coming up with random components that make up a flag, you can just have graphics with a transparent alpha layer that overlay each other. Changing colours may be a bit trickier. The hacky solution would be to have multiple versions of each template, each in a different colour, but that seems a bit silly. 
As far as I know, `TransparencyKey` has been semi-broken since Vista due to the changes in the way the desktop is rendered (Aero/DWM). For specific colors it behaves strangely or plain doesn't work, without any obvious rhyme or reason. The place to report .NET bugs is [connect.microsoft.com](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio), though I'm not entirely sure if this is a bug within the framework or within the Windows API or DWM. As a workaround, you can try to find a different color that works. Either a different color altogether, or something imperceivably different like RGB(255, 255, 254).
Guessing I'm not quite grokking the entire meaning here. If I have a three-section flag, you are saying to make each section transparent. But wouldn't that just make it one big transparent area?
Yeah, it's how Photoshop works! You can edit different portions of a composite image together on different layers just like how I described your flag above. You might even benefit with looking up youtube videos on layering composite images together.
connect how, exactly? you can access controls across forms, and you can access form-level objects across forms too if you define them Public
If you are using POCOs and object databinding, then you can just bind each DGV to the same object and they'll update accordingly.

this is really more of an SQL question. in most DBs you can something like `SELECT * FROM q WHERE times = (SELECT min(times) FROM q)`. in some DBs you can even grab the random row using "window functions". 
If you're using sql server, you can use select top 1 * from &lt;table&gt; order by &lt;condition&gt;

This will not help them in any way. They're basically wasting their money on the programming course if they do this. At one of my programming jobs, there was a young woman who was hired. She'd apparently done this all through school, getting guys to do her homework for her, passing all the tests purely by charm, etc. She was basically useless on the job. She spent all day in chat trying to get her old classmates to write programs for her. She was fired within a week for not even knowing the very basics of how to build a program. If people in this subreddit want to wind up like that, best of luck to them. I was the opposite. I taught myself to program, just because I loved it. And when I finally took a course, there were times when I was explaining things to the instructor. He joked that I should just stay home and he'd give me the credit, but I actually liked being there.
Nobody on this reddit should be helping one another in visual basic!! No questions are allowed!!!

How exactly did she get hired? I am self taught and don't think I would have a chance to get through some of the programming challenges in most interviews.
Do you have a bot to instantly comment this on all new threads?
No questions allowed? I get that we don't want to do people's assignments for them, but the sidebar states straight up that it's a place to discuss, ask questions and share ideas etc....
If you want the entire program when you click the X on any form: (You will need to complete this on all forms) 1. On your form designer click the lighting on the top of the properties window 2. Find 'FormClosing' 3. Double click on the empty box next to 'FormClosing' 4. Enter this code For Each f As Form In My.Application.OpenForms f.Close() Next 
You can do the same thing with one line of code...
This is ridiculous, where as most would agree that we feel frustrated by people just trying to get there homework done. There are a number of people on here who are truly trying to learn. 
I guess there was no programming test in the interview. They just took the diploma at face value. I guess, they learned their lesson after that. They were a new company.
No, do your own thinking and homework for fuck sake.
Its not my homework...I am an intern that has zero programming knowledge and was thrown a vba task...I don't think I would have survived without your guys help and I've learned so much! I am really grateful! I tell myself if anything if someone stumbles into my questions to solve their issue well there ya go! We are all contributing to the online knowledge this way!
and "equals" comparison is an exact match. I assume you mean to compare to that comma delimited list, you can't do that. you have to do an equal for each item separately using OR. or maybe store those items in an array and do a loop.
 If (RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Provincial Governments and municipalities" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Federation of Canadian Municipalities" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Quebec" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Manitoba" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Alberta" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Saskatchewan" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Ontario" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "New-Brunswick" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = British - Columbia Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Nova Scotia" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Prince Edward Island" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Newfoundland" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Yukon" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Northwest Territories" Or RepOrgDropDown.Value = "Nunavut") Then Label66.Visible = False Label133.Visible = False IAETrue.Visible = False IAEFalse.Visible = False End If End Sub Still not working...hmmmm
I'm not sure in what ways vba differs here, but with dropdowns I use the .text property, not .value. maybe that's it?
There are a bunch of different ways to access a dropdown's selection value and I always have trouble remembering the exact one I need to use in different scenarios... Try using `.Text` instead of `.Value`... otherwise, if you know the dropdown list will be relatively stable and unlikely to change, maybe reference `SelectedIndex`, since that will probably be easier to read. Other dropdown properties to try are `SelectedItem` and `SelectedValue`. 
Yes that worked wooooooot!

Interesting, but this locks you into those specific dice values. Good for D&amp;D, but won't let you roll a d22 for example. Perhaps this would be more dynamic (and less code), but still give you the same results? function roll(argDie as string, optional modifier as integer = 0) as integer Dim rollval As Integer = 0 '--Remove the "d" dim iMaxDie as integer = argDie.replace("d","").replace("D","") '--roll! rollval += rnd.Next(1, iMaxDie +1) + modifier '--return the value return rollval end function Now you can: roll("d20") or roll("d100") or roll("D33",-2)
That's true to some degree, although it's easy enough to enum more [non standard] dice types. For D&amp;D I generally operate with a standard dice set [d3 is usually just a halved d6 though]. Mine is literally a "dice roller", rather than a general randomizer, as I was shooting mainly for "gamer readable" randoms. Yours is definitely more flexible. :-) Anything else I'd use in a game session would generally be done via modifiers and multi-rolls, which are wrapped into the function. My old roller would also create an array to collect each individual roll so that the viewer could see a breakout of the total.
No, do your own thinking and homework for fuck sake.
I am sorry but I have tried many things. I tought somehow with a httpwebrequest but I have no real idea how to do that, because all browser automatically get the right video url after loading the webpage.
&gt;Now we have all the values, so roll! &gt;2d4-3 now becomes ([RandomNumber.Next(1, 4+1)] *2) -3 Am I reading this right? You only roll the dice once and then multiply that result by the number of rolls? So if the random.next produces 3 then the result is 6 because you multiply it by 2. Not very realistic. You should take the 2 and use it as a number for a loop and accumulate each roll eg 2d4+3 ' Get your values from the string. for the sake of example, we'll store them into the following variables rolls = 2 die = 4 modifier = 3 totalDiceResults = 0 for x = 1 to rolls totalDiceResults += RandomNumber.Next(1, iFinalDieMax + 1) next totalDiceResults += modifier return totalDiceResults This is a more realistic random roll as your results without any modifier would always produce an even number as the result. Example 2d4 if a 1 is rolled, result is 2 if a 2 is rolled, result is 4 if a 3 is rolled, result is 6 if a 4 is rolled, result is 8 with the loop method, you could roll a 3 and then a 2 which would give you a result of 5. This isn't possible in your method. You also need to fix your iFinalDieMax value.
That isn't Visual Basic, it is VBA, and would be better suited posted at /r/vba Although this might just be considered spam since you are just linking unsolicited to your blog with ads on it.
Depends on your DM I suppose. The way we play, you roll once and apply the multiplier, then add the bonus. But I see your point. For 4d6, you may want to roll 4 seperate die. I'll see about making fixes later. Thanks.
You are trying to hinder learning.
It was the only way to program a commodore 64!
Ahh found it, may as well show answer for other rookies like me. Dim APPDATA As String = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("APPDATA")
My method would've been Shell("cd %appdata%") May not be the best method.
Yes, you can use AppActivate and SendKeys if you don't mind losing foreground focus and temporary keyboard control.. Or you can use WinAPI to forge event messages such as button presses, menu selections, mouse activity, etc. but this is trickier as you need to determine the hWnds of the controls in question but the messages can be found out in Spy++
great info. thanks man
This is not my video, it is by "Byte of Tech" very helpful video, and he added me on Skype and fixed my code with me. Really helpful guide.
I originally started learning VB6 to create hacks for Starcraft. It has kind of stuck with me ever since.
unless you sanitize, which an ID from a combobox could easily be.
The most secure way to accomplish what you want is a parameterized query. The syntax for which depends on your database and your connection type(OleDB, ADODB, etc.). Since you mention OleDB I will outline the process of creating a connection, data adapter, command, and parameter and how to use them. In order for any of this to work you will need to import "System.Data.OleDB" First off you will need a connection to your database. This is the easy part: Dim conn As New OleDb.OleDbConnection("YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING") You will need to replace "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING" with, you guessed it, your connection string. Now lets set up your command using the query you mention. For clarity sake I'll do it in two steps: 'Set up the SQL string to be run against the data Dim cSQL as string = "SELECT SUM(tblIngredients.Cost * tblComponentIngredients.Quantity) AS Sub_Total " &amp; _ "FROM tblIngredients, tblComponentIngredients, tblComponents " &amp; _ "WHERE tblComponents.ComponentID=tblComponentIngredients.ComponentID " &amp; _ "AND tblComponentIngredients.IngredientID=tblIngredients.IngredientID " &amp; _ "AND tblComponents.ComponentID=[@ComponentID];" 'Create a command object using the SQL we just wrote. Dim cmd as new OleDb.OleDbCommand(cSQL, conn) Next comes the parameter. Parameterized queries are a bit weird but they protect you from all sorts of bad stuff so they are something that you should learn to love. 'Declare a new parameter: Dim par As New OleDb.OleDbParameter("@ComponentID", OleDbType.Integer) With {.Value = &lt;YOUR_PARAMETER_VALUE&gt;} 'Add the Parameter to the Command cmd.Parameters.Add(par) If you had multiple parameters in one query you would need to add them to the command in the order that they appear in the SQL. This is due to the psuedo-named nature of the parameters in the SQL text itself. Just something to bear in mind. Next you'll need a DataAdapter. Data adapters are helpers that make it easy to run a command against a database and push the data returned into a data table. You can use them to update data but thats outside the scope of the question. The Data adapter constructor takes in a command so we will use the one we just created. Dim da As New OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter(cmd) And thats it. You are now set up to run your command against the database. 'Instantiate a DataTable to hold the results Dim dt As New System.Data.DataTable() 'Fill the DataTable using the data adapter. da.Fill(dt) "dt" now contains the results of the SQL you set up earlier. So all you need to do is put these code snippets into a function that either returns a Data Table or whatever and have it take in the ComponentID you are trying to look up. Easy-peasy. This approach is much more complicated than string manipulation but it guards you against SQL injection which is a huge concern for every system you will build. I don't think I missed any steps but if you have any questions or errors just let me know.
+2 for report viewer. it's more work, but it's the right way, and also you gain a new skill
Yes, @ComponentID will be replaced with whatever you put there. It's really not that complicated once you've done it once or twice. Instead of sending just a string to the DB, you're sending a 'command object' that contains both the command and the parameters within it. There is a 'gotcha' you need to be aware of: do not send more parameters than what the command uses. This may not be applicable to what you're doing here, but if you ever find yourself in a position where you are re-using a command object, be sure to .clear() all of the parameters each time you re-use it.
That would be perfect, but if too difficult then just Surname would work. No worries, yeah it was quite similar so It took me a while to figure out it was C#

Cell doesn't look to be a variable in scope in that line of code in question. The only variable called Cell is in your for each loop, so scope for that variable is limited to the loop. Did you want **Cells** there?
Oh sweet, thanks for this, I couldnt find anything on youtube on the Access VB connection that had a voice over. Cheers

use string concatenation... txt1.Text = txt1.Text &amp; (filesplit(0) + vbCrLf)
That's probably it. I'll shuffle my structure around to put the declarations at the top. Thanks! 
what's the error?
Type mismatch It's really throwing me because I'm not sure how it's failing. I'm leaning towards a problem caused by the variables already being defined, but when I add code to clear them (which I could be doing wrong) it still errors out. Has the type of data changed somehow? 
But bwprinters is declared as String, Dim bwprinters(4) As String When would it have become converted into a Long? BwPrints is a Long but that's a different variable that should be a number.
Here is what's happening. In If InStr(Cells(strRowNoList, "K").Text, elem) &gt; 0 Then The first time it runs through the program it actually causes elem = 4515 (the first entry of that listed array). If I set that first elem to be "apple" it still throws the same error. So I tried to declare the elem as string and get the compile error "For Each control variable on arrays must be Variant" So at some point it's assigning the control variable as a Varient and giving it a value it won't review again after the first pass. I'm looking up how to clear out a variable now. It's not as straight forward as I would have thought.
I almost never use foreach. a for loop and just accessing the item index will possibly bypass all these issues.
 txt1.Text = File.ReadAllText(filename).Replace(",", vbCrLf) 
That's the conclusion I came to, but I ran out of time to try it. I'm just shocked that using that elements variable assigns it a value in such an arbitrary fashion. Thanks for all your help, it really got my gears moving and helped me figure out what was being wierd. 
I'm sorry. I'm not really familiar with the VB terms. Would you be able to break it down a little? I am not sure what you mean by update code?

Thanks! Was fun to see VB6 doing weird things. :D
Thanks! Was hoping it might be useful for people wanting to learn how emulation works.
best I can tell it creates an infinite loop....
I know what it does, I want to know the reason for it. it's generally a bad idea to do that
I don't, I am literally figuring this out as I go. 
 "I can't fathom one reason at all for it because..." I was trying to solve an entirely unrelated issue and testing if ending and recalling the function worked. It did, so I then added an exit point.
You click in the outer left column of your code and it will add a red circle in the column. Then when you run your code and it hits that line, it will stop and allow you to look at variable values and you can step through the code line by line as it executes which makes it a lot easier to figure out what is going wrong.
Programs do exactly what you tell them to, nothing more, nothing less. Do you ever tell it to print the contents of the ArrayList? 
I think you're gonna have to use a BackgroundWorker, which will allow your form to update while the code is running. There's 3 primary functions associated with BackgroundWorkers that you'll have to write -- DoWork, ProgressChanged, and WorkerCompleted (going from memory here so I may be off on the names, MSDN will have full examples). DoWork it's where you'll run the loop to handle the movement change calculations, and ProgressChanged is where you'll update the label position or text. If you look up a tutorial on how to handle a ProgressBar it should give you the basic principles you're looking for. 
I'd start with these: https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Basic-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners
It just highlights the whole row, I'm not sure if it's on the InStr but I believe it is. With cells passing a string and elem passing a variable (if I'm saying that correctly).
Well the Array list works. However your ouput will not Show the contents of the ArrayList. On this line: Console.WriteLine(“Days of the Week Are:”) The only Output would be "Days of the week Are" I would suggest including a for loop which would look like the following: For i as integer = 0 to DaysOfTheWeek.Count - 1 Console.Writeline(DaysOfTheWeek(i)) Next Console.Readline() This Piece of Code Will Allow you to OutPut/(Print) all the days of the week.
I can help you understand it if you like, its a very simple piece of code. I mean its the Easiest way imo to Print the days, which your original code does not do.
the break should stop your code when you are in your loop. The locals window will show you exactly what you are passing to the InStr. I would imagine that VB doesn't know that you are passing it a string. If you cast it to a string it might help?
Good to Hear mate.
I don't think I read your whole previous post because I was in a hurry. There's some good stuff here to try.

1. You are making a local variable (ctr). That will output an error 2. The answer is 169
So the first pic is a working receipt, but it looks crap. I need it to be formatted to look nicer. The title of the company at the top, in a bigger font. Something you could give to a customer. The second picture is how I want it to look, but I can't figure out how to print the entire groupbox.
I don't see anywhere that the input values are being specified. Everything is an empty value, so 0 will always be the output. 
Btw, you can also use this http://www.ascii-code.com/ Basically do a &amp; Chr(?) &amp; ? = ASCII Decimal
Was just about to say the same
So I added ContentLength = data.length and PreAuthenticate = True. The stream writer wants Byte data type, what should I do? Wouldn't something like Dim data As Byte() = Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(postData) still be encoding it twice?
&gt;Wouldn't something like Dim data As Byte() = Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(postData) still be encoding it twice? No, the problem is specifically with URL encoding, which takes certain special characters and turns them into %xx strings. Text encoding is an entirely different matter and is always required to represent a string as bytes, it does not change the content of the strings (assuming the encoding can represent all characters). You should probably use `Encoding.UTF8` instead of `Encoding.Unicode` (which is actually UTF16).
Okay, I changed Unicode to UTF8. So I'm confused as to where I am messing up, I changed postData to not UrlEncode the "=", am I missing something?
You're also missing the "&amp;" delimiters in the `postData` string.
So Dim postData As String = "To=" &amp; HttpUtility.UrlEncode(message.To) &amp; "&amp;From=" &amp; HttpUtility.UrlEncode(message.From) &amp; "&amp;Body=" &amp; HttpUtility.UrlEncode(message.Body)
The same. Mostly. I'm not an expert at formatting....
I've solved my issue, thank you for greatly for your assistance! I'll make another comment with completed code in the event anyone else looks for anything like it.
Fixed Code: Public Function sendMessage(ByVal message As SMSMessage) As String Dim sUrl As String = "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/" &amp; ACCOUNT_SID &amp; "/Messages.json" Dim wRequest As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(sUrl) Dim postData As String = "To=" &amp; message.To &amp; "&amp;From=" &amp; message.From &amp; "&amp;Body=" &amp; HttpUtility.UrlEncode(message.Body) Dim data As Byte() = Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData) wRequest.Credentials = New NetworkCredential(AccountSID, strAUTH_TOKEN) wRequest.PreAuthenticate = True wRequest.Method = "POST" wRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" wRequest.ContentLength = data.Length Dim stream As Stream = wRequest.GetRequestStream() stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length) stream.Close() Dim wResponse As WebResponse = wRequest.GetResponse Dim sResponse As String = "" Using srRead As New StreamReader(wResponse.GetResponseStream()) sResponse = srRead.ReadToEnd() End Using Return sResponse End Function
Now you're not URL encoding the values at all, this will probably break if someone tries to send a message containing a "&amp;", line break, or any number of other special characters.
You are correct. After troubleshooting, if I encoded the message.To and message.From, it threw back a bad request. Logically I suppose it makes since that those values should never be anything other than numbers (as the fields are for phone numbers). After only encoding message.Body, it seems to accept "&amp;test$okay" as a test value. I changed the above code to reflect the change.
Perhaps you might have better luck browsing Github for examples?

probably a book, it's been 20+ years though, and not in VB. after you understand the concepts, looking through he reference to see what the new language you're leaning can do with standard concepts will get you started
Not sure which version of vb you are using but this works on 2010, 2013 and 2015.
Is there another way I can be good at arrays? Teach me your ways
no problems now go do your homework :P 
It looks like your issue is likely naming related. json.net needs to find classes that are named to match the classes in the json. IMO, the easiest way to do this is to run the JSON through json2csharp, and then manually convert the c# to VB (or run the resulting c# code through a c# to VB converter if there's a lot of it). Then you'll have the correct class definitions to support the json. So take the json and paste it here: http://json2csharp.com/ Since this is a pretty small one, you can probably just convert it by hand, but if you need a converter, there's a decent on here: http://converter.telerik.com/ 
What?
You would need to check the value of the textbox when the submit button is **clicked**. Something like this that uses the button's 'Clicked' event: Private Sub btnSubmit_Clicked(ByVal ...) Handles btnSubmit.Clicked If txtFirstName.Text.Length = 0 Then MsgBox("Enter your first name", MsgBoxStyle.Critical) End If End Sub If you have other code that need to go after it, you can either use an Else statement and put the other code in there or use 'Exit Sub'
WHAT?
you mean an array filled with numbers 1-100 in which case look up a for loop
Gonna guess that this exception occurs when you test it with an empty textbox? Because the error itself is occurring because there's nothing in the textbox. My guess is that you're testing to make sure the MessageBox fires when the box is empty. The problem is that after you dismiss the MessageBox, the rest of the code still executes. You'll need to put an "Exit Sub" inside the If block that checks the length of that textbox, so that the code will stop executing after the messagebox.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5z06z1kb.aspx look here
Understand first that an array is nothing more than a series of boxes designed to hold variables. The first box is labelled 0, the second box 1, the third box 2 and so on. In your instance, they're designed to hold integers, or whole numbers: so that's the only thing they're going to do. You usually refer to a value in an array by the label. So if you have an array named MyArray and you're interested in the first item (which, remember, is labelled 0), you will access it like this: MyArray(0) Arrays also have certain built-in functions: stuff like .min, .max, .length and so on. These functions tell you stuff about the array: .min gives you the smallest value, .max tells you the largest value, .length tells you how many boxes the array has and so on. [This article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wak0wfyt.aspx) is a little technical, but it tells you everything you need to know about using arrays in VB.NET and is a great reference tool. Another popular and important way to access the values stored in your array is to use a For-Next loop: For n = 0 to MyArray.Length - 1 'do something with MyArray(n) Next What this effectively does is go through every box in your array and do something with each of them: maybe you want to total the values of each box in your array, maybe you want to set them all to a certain value, whatever. How did we do that? We created a control variable called n that runs from 0 (the first label in the array) to MyArray.Length -1 (the last label in the array; the .Length function returns the total number of boxes in the array, and since your first box starts at 0, you'll have to -1 to get the correct label for the last box). 
You'll still have problems/get unexpected results with your code if the user enters a first name but has no last name or didn't enter a DOB year. You should be checking all of your inputs before you attempt to generate the user name. Private Sub btnGenerateUsername_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGenerateUsername.Click If txtFirstName.Text.Length = 0 Then MessageBox.Show("Enter your first name", "Missing Value", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning) txtFirstName.Focus() ElseIf txtLastName.Text.Length = 0 Then MessageBox.Show("Enter your last name", "Missing Value", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning) txtLastName.Focus() ElseIf IsNothing(cmbDOB.SelectedItem) Then MessageBox.Show("You must select your D.O.B Year", "Missing Value", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning) cmbDOB.Focus() Else lblGeneratedUsername.Text = cmbDOB.Text &amp; txtLastName.Text &amp; txtFirstName.Text(0) End If End Sub
Thanks TheFotty!. The values in the xml file are just fake ones due to security reasons, the values are different in the actual file. But, I think I didn't explain correctly what was the problem. The problem is that I have to nodes: one called &lt;Archive name="normal"/&gt; and the other called: &lt;Archive name="fail"/&gt;, I want to be able to get the value of the root attribute which is placed after the root name = "x" attribute only from the &lt;Archive name="normal"/&gt; node. Start searching here: &lt;Archive&gt; &lt;Archive name="normal"/&gt; &lt;Roots&gt; &lt;Root name="x" root="blanco"/&gt; to here. Is that what you are explaining in the 'EXAMPLE ENUMERATING ROOT NODES AND DISPLAYING root ATTRIBUTE VALUE I really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance!
The piece of code in the example: Dim normalRootXValue = SampleXML...&lt;Archive&gt;.Where(Function(x) x.@name = "normal").First...&lt;Root&gt;.Where(Function(x) x.@name = "x").First.@root MessageBox.Show(normalRootXValue) will display "blanco" Note my example used an XML literal as the sample data, but if yours is coming from a file you just need to load it Dim sampleXML = XElement.Load("C:\myfile.xml")
In addition to what /u/quadmra said, here's another example of where arrays can come in useful. For instance, let's say you were making a game where each character would have 10 stats. Now you could declare each of the 10 stats with separate integer variables, but why not do it like this? Const strength as Integer = 0 Const magic as Integer = 1 Const speed as Integer = 2 .... Dim heroStats() as Integer heroStats(strength) += 1 ' this increases heroStats(0) by 1 This not only allows you still directly refer to each stat, but also do a For-Next to sum up all of your character's stats if you need to; quickly find the lowest value using heroStats.Min(), or the highest value with .Max; easily set default values with For-Next for each stat, and so on. You have all the advantages of keeping each variable separate, but with the added advantage of being able to manipulate them altogether in new and exciting ways.

Thanks again!. and I am sorry to bother you, but I am getting an error telling me that "XML descendant element cannot be selected from type 'SystemXML.XMLDocument' ...and this is because my XML file is already in a TextReader variable and then loaded in XMLDocument variable... like this: Dim doc As XmlDocument Dim reader As XmlTextReader doc = New XmlDocument() reader = New XmlTextReader("C:\temp\myXMLfile.xml") doc.Load(reader) ....does this make any sense? by the way I am trying to formatt the code line correctly in this message, but I don't know how...I mean every line of code is in a new line.
Thank you for your response. So I do not need the attachment of the image but just the link path of the image? If I am to place the link path of the images into access and get it connected to microsoft visuals , when i export it to a program, will it effect the database? For example, if I install it into another pc, will it be able to search and display the image? By the way, how to code for the display of multiple images at once and the ability to search for a certain field e.g colours or names. Thank you very much.
I agree that the format does not look quite right. Assuming it is correct you can use Visual Studio to create classes from the XML. You can then deserialize the XML from the file into an object. This allows you to just use the object properties instead of querying the XML for each attribute. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh371548(v=vs.110).aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fa420a9y(v=vs.110).aspx 
I had a lot of issues with 10. A lot of the old DLLs are missing. I'm running a Win 7 VM to do my VB6 development at work
sounds interesting.. I will check this out..Thanks for your comment.
Thanks I got it!
Will try thanks!
Sure. 1) You declare an array with the capacity to hold all items from Me.RandomNumbers.Items which seems to be a collection of some sort. 2) You copy all items from said collection into your array. CopyTo(target, index) says you copy all items into the target array, but start at target(index) to write. So if you have other data in the target array before the index, it will remain untouched. 3) You apply the Min operation from System.Linq which from an Enumerable takes the smallest value.
When and why would you use the copy to array method? 
You use it when you want to copy elements into an already existing array. You may be passed an array from a library or something else you don't control and need to fill your stuff into it. If you just want a new array containing all elements from a collection, then you can also just write collection.ToArray()
I know outlook gets pissy about OLE stuff with certain compose/reply operations. if you have a way check if the compose window is open and just delay you macro until it's not, that might work best.
I can easily do that, but I would prefer [**this**](http://imgur.com/3weWifj) layout printed out because it's much nicer and easier to read when printed than just [**this**](http://imgur.com/W2kJS4p) where all the data is in one row.
Honestly, your best bet would be to create an actual report using the report designer and connect that to your data, but I don't know what version of VS2015 you have. As far as I know in VS2015, you have to install the SQL Server Data Tools when you installed VS2015 to get the SQL Report Designer stuff. If you are using community edition, I believe it is still an option though.
I still don't understand how I can format my print form as I want it to print. Would I use *Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools* within Visual Studio to design my print form as I want it?
Well you essentially don't use a form at all. Forms are for on screen, not for printing. What I am suggesting is creating a report that will contain the data you want to print, and it will allow you to print it out, in whatever format you decide to design it with. I don't know your level of skill when it comes to programming, so I am not sure how complex or simple you would need things described to you.
I think he is saying that you can use reporting software that is built into Visual Studio. It's made for printing. I am not sure if it works with Community. But onto your original question. You have a bunch of text boxes. I assume they are created dynamically through some sort of loop. Just loop through your Data table and set the text based on the current data row in the data table
an array of characters is also known as a string. maybe there is a method that converts to string
I am sorry. I've made a mistake.
Can you help me code a small part of the fillarray procedure? I am still having problems. Is there a good tutorial online that could help me with this kind of stuff. I'm not an absolute beginner and I know what an array is.
Do you have something you'd like to do with an array, or are you just looking for general info? 
I need an array tutorial for sorting arrays from lowest to highest and finding lowest number in an array
I have no resources to link you, but this hopefully makes sense. Happy to answer any questions. For sorting arrays, have a look at some sorting algorithms. I'd suggest a bubble sort for easy coding. For this, you simply use a for/do loop for the one less than the size of the array, and create a variable integer. For each index in the array, use an if statement to check if the value is bigger than the next one, and if so, store it as temp, swap the second with the first, and continue up the array. I realise this may not be so clear, if you're not wanting to try the little problem solving to get it working, here's a rough idea (syntax may be wrong). Dim temp as int Dim array(20) as int For i = 0 to 19 then If array(i) &gt; array(i+1) Temp = array(i) Array(i) = array(i+1) Array(i+1) = temp Next This will sort smallest to highest, swap the inequality symbol to reverse this. I'd suggest reading up on some theory of sorting algorithms, may be useful later on, or just as an interesting logic puzzle. Your other problem : I'm not completely sure I fully understand, but I'll give you my view on what I think you asked, if it's not 100%, just say what I can change. Say the number generated is 13, and it is stored as the integer variable 'number'. Probably in a different sub (for near coding - I'd use local variables and call it through to this new sub via byval to prevent problems, and good coding practice). Within the sub, take the number to be a string (let me know if you want more info on this). Take this 'number' and use the mid function. If they are all 2 digit, take mid(number,1) and mid (number,2) and store them in a new variable, called for example 'sum', added together. (In fact, you could do this all in a function, would be way better imo). Then, back in whatever sub you want, add 'number' to 'sum' and store 'number' in array(sum). *Edit: I reread your post, and I realise I went off in a slightly different direction. You want the number to be generated from the sum, not the ordinal number decided from the generated one. So, go about what I suggested in a slightly reversed order, I would advise using the mid function still, but using a for loop with the number of indexes you have, and using the for loop's value as your 'number' variable.* Can I ask what use this has? Probably I have misunderstood, but other wise would love to see what you want to use it for (or even just experimenting with vb!). 
Did you sent that ContentManagmentStrip to the form under the form settings, or are you displaying it on a mousedown() event of the form? If it's a mousedown event on the form manually showing the menu, I think you'll need to manually close the menu too, on an event such as LostFocus.
Edit: Hyperlink formatting.
That entirely depends on what you want to do.
Everything was done with Click() events, but foolishly, it never occurred to me to hide the menu myself! (probably because it happens automatically for everything else). Adding FileToolStripMenuItem.HideDropDown() fixed the problem! Thank you

You need to read each line and launch each process in a loop. For Each ProcessName As String In IO.File.ReadAllLines("C:\AppReader.txt") Process.Start(ProcessName) Next
IMHO it would be better to use an `Integer()` or a `List(Of Integer)`instead of the `ArrayList`. Using typed collections protects against many pitfalls. (Also the instructions specifically asked for an array...)
Triggering events based on the mouse location would actually be fairly easy to implement if your GUI is relatively simple.
I didn't copy and past the code from my homework. What kind of homework would give you the code? I am stuck and I don't know how to code it. This is my program. What do you mean I didn't try anything at all? The dude is trying to pull some vote manipulation now.
&gt; closing the program and using it another time would result in CustomerID being set back to 1 This is why we let the database service autonumber the rows for us. The database, which is persistent data, knows the highest row number (ID number) and works with that. My code in circumstances like this I usually make the customer first, and receive back a new customerID which I then use to make the order, where I get the orderID (and use the customerID), then make the cake (and use the OrderID)
Also this is the output I'm looking for http://imgur.com/Fj8Kk45 The loop is able to print the inputted number fine. I'm having trouble adding the other text into the box without it repeating every time I click the button. It seems so easy but I'm stuck for some reason.
Can you break it down to the specific issue you're having, there's a little bit of code here, but I see several issues. Like, why are you adding this to your list box every time the index is changed? Private Sub ListBox1_SelectedIndexChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles lstNumbers.SelectedIndexChanged lstNumbers.Items.Add("These are the numbers you entered") End Sub Here it seems you aren't setting your variables correctly, like num doesn't seem to be global variable and you're trying to set it in another sub. Should be num = GetInput(num) Private Sub btnDisplay_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnDisplay.Click Dim num As Integer Dim eventotal If DataVal() Then GetInput(num) LoopSub(num, eventotal) End If End Sub Sub GetInput(ByRef num) num = CInt(txtInput.Text) End Sub Your not sending anything for eventotal to the loop sub so why is that required? Seems like you should be putting your listbox.items.add inside the loop Sub LoopSub(ByRef num As Integer, ByRef eventotal As Integer) For i = 1 To lstNumbers.Items.Count If num Mod 2 = 0 Then eventotal += num End If Next lstNumbers.Items.Add(num) lstNumbers.Items.Add(eventotal) txtInput.Clear() txtInput.Focus() End Sub Too much going on with too many errors, I'm not going to do the homework for you so please give us some error messages. And I'll help you figure them out. Thanks!
I guess I needed to be more detailed. This is the first time, I have taken a programming course. I thought this subreddit, could help me. It's fine now I had another friend help me. Congratulation on being 43 and not caring about internet point that is quiet an impressive feat. 
All of the while using @@Identity to recieve the ID it's just been assigned by autonumber? At all places where an autonunber is possible/correct in the database, it's used
I'd go and reverse engineer how the program keeps track of animations. If there's a simple check on the total amount of animations being loaded, then you'd be able to change that comparison and see a change in the program's behavior.
Here is a very simple [GDI+ game project](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0kurdcqcql835l/DragonDrop3.zip?dl=0) that I made. [DragonDrop 3 - Screen Shot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8at68hvk14shlfw/DragonDrop3.png?dl=0) What I'm thinking is that the way I'm handling the "Drag and Drop" character movement, might provide you with some ideas for an easy means of button making. When doing games, GDI+ or otherwise, I strongly recommend against adding Windows form controls or messages boxes at all. They can cause a number of performance issues as well as stealing focus and causing anomalies with key detection. On top of that, I personally tend to feel that they take something away from the "feel" of the game environment. A simple custom control class should be pretty easy to build and implement.
See if [this](http://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/24051838/Automate-HTTP-Basic-Authentication.html) helps you at all. 
With WebRequest [System.Net &amp; System.IO]: Dim strURI As New Uri("https://mysecuresite.com/whatever") ' CREATE WEB REQUEST Dim WR As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(strURI.ToString) ' AUTHENTICATE Dim myCache As New CredentialCache myCache.Add(New Uri(strURI.ToString), "Basic", New NetworkCredential("yourusername", "yourpassword")) WR.Credentials = myCache ' GET RESPONSE Dim response As WebResponse = WR.GetResponse Dim WS As Stream = response.GetResponseStream ' READ RESPONSE Dim reader As New StreamReader(WS) Dim Output As String = reader.ReadToEnd If you're using a browser control, the process of executing web events and populating web forms will be done via HTML and script Elements. Examples: ' ALTER THE TEXT PROPERTY OF A BOX CALLED lst-ib wbBrowser.Document.GetElementById("lst-ib").InnerText = TextBox1.Text ' EXECUTE A MOUSE CLICK EVENT AGAINST A BUTTON CALLED btnK wbBrowser.Document.GetElementById("btnK").InvokeMember("click")
The child controls must be placed not just above but *into* the tab control. Just selecting them and dragging them onto the tab page should do the trick, or using cut and paste while you have the tab selected. I believe you can also change the hierarchy with the document outline option somewhere in the View menu.
If you mean a WebBrowser control within your app, then yes, although I'm not 100% certain how well that will work if your password box is a "Pop Out" browser window, rather than a floating DIV. Note: Oh wow! I'm slow today... I only just noticed you tagged this as VB6... I'm on VB.NET 2010. 
OK, how about this. When you open the form/start the app. can you grab the largest customer ID, say using DMax (that's an old VBA function,) or the current LINQ equivalent, and just increment from there?

From the sidebar &gt;Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the questing as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen.

Why not use one of the browser extensions that do this for you? Doesn't lastpass do this? To do this in VB6 would require essentially writing your own browser plugin and monitoring the traffic and submitting the credentials as needed.
There are several ways to do this: One is to to expose a variable / property in the dialog form, so that you can retrieve it just before closing the dialog. Another would be to create a function in the second form that returns the status, and call that function for the dialog. Yet another (the least optimal) would be to use a global variable to hold the value of the combo box so that it's available to both forms. 
Ok thanks for your reply!
Hmm no, I haven't learned any of that. My professor did touch on If statements and I've put a couple of those into my program. I'm going to look into these items though and see what I am able to do, thanks!
Interrogate the computer to show the logged on username and which permission groups they're a member of. Very useful information if you ever have to use VB to script admin stuff.
Yeah I managed to do that, If its one colour it goes to the other!
Managed to do both of these now! Thanks for the suggestion. The slider took me a REALLY long time to figure out. 
Thanks, I did these today as well, I also did a Light switch button. switching between white background and black forecolor to black background and white forecolor.
Hey, I just got the light switch done as well!
Elder Scrolls name, nice!
Good Job, I enjoyed the light switch the most, It made me proud when I was done.
Are you using Visual Studio?
I use My.settings If you go into your programs properties and then go into settings from there you can define settings, the type and scope as well as a value. You can change them like anything. Here is a snipit from my code ''' &lt;summary&gt; ''' Returns the current color value stored for the percentage a device backup is completed defined in the applications settings ''' &lt;/summary&gt; ''' &lt;value&gt;&lt;/value&gt; ''' &lt;returns&gt;color&lt;/returns&gt; ''' &lt;remarks&gt;&lt;/remarks&gt; Public Property cPercetnageComplete As Color Get Return My.Settings.PercentComplete End Get Set(value As Color) My.Settings.PercentComplete = value End Set End Property
That's what I'm doing now but I don't like all of these subs that handle the click event for each button. I tried to add another button after the handles keyword which is automatically generated after double clicking a button which had no handle event addicted with it. That did not work.
&gt;outputTextBox.Text = "Year: " &amp; ControlChars.Tab &amp; " Depreciation: " Your output never includes any variables that would hold your calculations. You are getting the output you describe because that is the only thing you are putting in outputTextBox.
Use a list of char Dim lettersGuessedSoFar As New List(Of Char) When the user inputs a character to guess, first see if it exists in the list of guessed characters. List objects have a .contains() method you can pass the char to and it will return true/false if the char is already in the list. If it is, they already guessed it and should be prompted again. If it is not, you can add it to the list and then proceed to see if it is found in the secret word.
You're on the right track. After handles separate all of the button names with a comma, eg Private Sub ButtonClick(...) Handles Button1.Click, Button2.Click Alternatively you can use the AddHandler method to programmatically assign each button's Click event to the sub. Which method you choose will depend on if your controls were created througy the Designer (in which case you'll use the former) or through code. 
can you give me an example?
Can you help me code a portion of it? I'll try to continue where you left off.
You should have learnt how to create a variable, how to compare values in variables, and how to loop or iterate through an array. That's all you need to know to do what I outlined above, which is the logic for findLowest(). Good luck! :)
How would I go about doing that?
you can... i dont know, if the code is 100%, but you will get the idea! CType(Me.FindControl("Button" &amp; i), Button).Text = "foo" 
&gt; I need help with: displaying the list only when a Display button is clicked – the listbox should not be visible before the Display button is clicked (modify so the display is clearer) modifying the program so that if all the rooms are taken a message is shown when the Add Guest button is clicked modifying the program to check for invalid room number modifying loadRoomNum so that the room numbers are assigned automatically using a nested loop (this will come in handy if there are 100 rooms in the hotel)

Why do you make a whole new reddit account and repost a question [you posted just yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/428921/wordguess/)?
Can you please help me. I'm still a noob for visual basic programming. I know you can see my messages. 
Create the buttons through code, then add them all to an array (most likely you'll want to use a 3D array for this purpose). Actually, since arrays of controls are a big pain in the behind, you may even want to consider using a three-layered dictionary, but that can get confusing if you're new. So consider just adding them to a list instead, with the button.tag property holding a value identifying its position in the grid. Alternatively do what /u/DarthDestroy3r suggests, but that still requires a lot of copy and pasting: Private Sub Button_Click(sender as Button, e as System.EventArgs) Handles Button1, Button2, Button3... Button81 'now sender will refer to the button that was just clicked 'so if you want to change the text to X... sender.Text = "X" End Sub
Can somebody please help me? Atleast tell me what to do? Explain in detail. I'm a noob for visual basic.
wow! You help dman with the code and you don't help me with code. Pls help me. I'm still a noob. I only started visual basic last month. pls help me.
I gave /u/dman-no-one a code snippet because they asked a syntax specific question. He demonstrated an understanding of his program's flow and needed help only with the implementation, not with the actual programming bit. You, on the other hand... you're basically outright asking someone to write the code for you. That's not cool. I've given you the logic and tools you need to write your code, so why don't you actually try writing it? If you've tried, show me what you've tried. Explain to me where and how you've failed, and I'll help you further.
I need help. I think I did my part wrong. In the textbox I need to enter the size of an array. When I want to call a function using that array(txtBox.text), it doesn't work. I get an error message. How do I create an array using the textbox information to get random numbers. My code is still up there.
No, there is something wrong with my random numbers part of the code. Can you check to see if it's correct? Is there a way you can improve it?
I end up getting another error message: An unhandled exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occurred in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll Additional information: Conversion from string "0 97" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
That's because your textbox.text has the string "0 97", which obviously cannot be converted into an integer.
I did. I literally put 10 in the textbox. Every single time I entered a number, I got a different error message. 0 84, 0 42, 0 87 
An unhandled exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occurred in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll Additional information: Conversion from string "0 25" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
PostalElf? Did you figure it out?
No the error message changes every time. An unhandled exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occurred in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll Additional information: Conversion from string "0 18" to type 'Integer' is not valid
I also noticed a red underline when I'm using the code that you gave me. The red underline is under the word number(count) for the number(count) = RandomNumbers.Items(count) part
Yeah your code's a mess. Good luck with it.
dude. help me
you are a VB.Net Intermediate. You should know how to do it.
People on this reddit are not the best source of help. The only thing they do is go around and downvote things with 0 response to your questions.
Thanks very much, that seems to have resolved the problems. I've taken your advice and have switched to using a 3D array and have looked into three-layered dictionaries for future reference as well. I'm sure one day I'll understand them.. and controls, I hope! I'm really grateful for the support! It's awesome that theres a community of people here on Reddit, willing to provide advice and give up some time just to help. Maybe at some point in the future I'll be able to help out someone else with their VB / other programming problems... just not whilst I've got so many of my own :P Thanks again! ______________________ (Edit: Just since I noticed - I'm sorry for any other issues I've accidentally caused with other people in other threads by asking this.. - It must be quite a hard job being a mod on this kind of sub, so I don't envy your position! Have a nice day,) 
Yeap, that's what I meant when I said create the buttons through code. :)
How? Is that the same thing I did before? I just went properties -&gt; databindings -&gt; text-&gt; choose the column in the table and it worked but once I use a query (I'm using mysql) and refresh the table, the textboxes no longer do anything.
It may be helpful to see what you have for your Encryption function. Hard to tell otherwise.
I need to modify this program to keep track of the total letters guessed in an array with meaningful indexes. I also need to include in the modification code so that it displays a message box if the user enters the same guess twice. 
 strFilename = "example.txt" If File.Exists(strFilename) Then... This is a perfectly valid piece of code. What problems are you having?
not knowing what a breakpoint does........... nevermind guys,thanks for the help, I just left a breakpoint somewhere and didn't notice.
&gt;I thought I had something with animation of WPF forms, but that doesn't seem to be the case as again that is C# based (same for any tutorials on how to do anything as of late). Well, virtually everything in the framework is C# based (I think even the VB.NET specific stuff is written in C#), but like everything else WPF works fine with VB.Net as well. WPF isn't a game engine, but it is hardware accelerated and offers decent graphics and animation capabilities. Can't speak for the tutorial situation, but if you familiarize yourself a little bit with the C# syntax, everything works the same in VB.
I kind of expected that WPF isn't a game engine, I just broadly thought of it as an animator. On the surface, is it suffice to say that I can perform flash-like animations with it? If that's the case, I can possibly stop the search here and use WPF. I'm just hoping I don't have to give the would be end-user a bunch of crap to be able to run it. Like the animations that I'm referring to aren't that difficult... (in my opinion). The shapes are another thing though: These are the animations in question: https://youtu.be/4lDOVksVgrU?t=105 (Ignore dialog and stage, I'm specifically talking about the style of the big board and the like.)
you'd need to track this yourself on the drop event
As far as I know the answer to your question is no, but heres the (mostly) full relationships anyway http://imgur.com/8gWZQNq
Which executescalar call is throwing up the exception? The first or second?
The second ExecuteNonQuery
Sheesh man I don't understand barely any of what you just said haha. There's test data in the database already, that I inserted using the original program (not this dumbed down version). After they'd been inserted and it tried to insert again (for cake) I got this error (just like I'm getting after the first insertion here, but this time with order). I then just copied the connection string, so this dumbed down version is connected to the database in the debug folder of the real project. This shouldnt be the problem though as I had the same error with the original project ___ Just to clarify, the reason this program is the dumbed down version and the values its inserted are hard coded is so I dont have to enter new details every time I just want to test this function.
I forgot to mention, when I copy paste these queries into the query wizard on access they both execute fine
OK, I figured it out. Actually, I thought about this sooner, but then said "nah, that wouldn't be it". However, sure enough it was. First off (and this doesn't have to do with the error) you can remove those middle .close and .open calls. Just open the DB connection, run all the queries you are going to run, and close it when it is done. As to the error, you are getting it because you are using the same command object, and you are not clearing the parameters you set for the first query when you call the second query. Meaning when you call that second ExecuteNonQuery, the command.Parameters list doesn't just have the one CustomerID parameter, it still has all the params from the Cake insert. The reason I didn't believe this would matter is because you are using explicitly named parameters, so one would expect it to just fill in the ones it needs to in your SQL insert statement (which for the order is just the CustomerID), but sure enough, if I cleared the params before adding the CustomerID one, it worked fine. So just add Command.Parameters.Clear() right before Command.Parameters.AddWithValue("[@CustomerID]", InsertedCustomerID) 
Thank you so much, just tested it mine works too. I guess this was down to my understanding of parameters, I didn't know they held a value I thought they passed it on then it was deleted from memory after. You're a saint, been racking my brains all day and in a bad mood with a headache until now, thanks!
Yeah it was a really annoying one because I know how to solve that error in most cases, and was confident in the database. Too true!
strings have to be in quotes. Dim ItemName as string = "TV Stand" What are you trying to do with the 125::= 325-200 line ??? 
`125::= 325 - 200 ` What is that line even for? Remove it.. When putting a value in a string, you have to include it in quotation marks. so should be `Dim itemNAme As String = "TV Stand"`
 End of Statement expected. Line 6 Dim itemName As String = TV Stand it's expecting the end of a statement, and you have something that isn't valid a valid end because string literals must be in double quotes. Syntax error. 125::= 325 - 200 I don't even know what this is supposed to do. did you mean it to be a comment? it's just not valid syntax in VB at all. deciphering compile errors is a double-guessing-game. the compiler is trying to guess what your code means based on it's rules, and give some an error based on that guess. then you have to guess what that error means in relation to what you meant your code to be. 
That line was supposed to be profit = retailPrice - wholeSaleprice Though, looking at it now it does seem fairly ridiculous. 
No not a comment. That line was supposed to be profit = retailPrice - wholeSaleprice Though, looking at it now it does seem fairly ridiculous. I just seem to have had a massive brain fart.
It's been a while since I've used resource files, but I believe that the call to the resource will return a string (so there's no need for the StreamReader). strTemp = My.Resources.Kanais_Cube_Weapons.split(Chr(44)) You can also use the character literal to make your code a bit more readable: .Split(","c) 
Dude. You didn't even know how to help that guy. You call yourself a vb.net intermediate. What a joke.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
here's what I'm not getting Lets say I have a list of student names, I want to create an instance of student for each one, and i would want to give it a different instance name for each one yes? that way I could pull up specific data per student? eg dim bob as student = new student() dim sally as student = new student() so I can do console.writeline(bob.historygrade) console.writeline(sally.historygrade) but given a list of student names how do I automate a new instance for every name. so if I have a txt file with bob sally I can streamreader the names but how do I make the instances? The internet is filled with examples of creating instances one by one, but I don't know what I'm looking for when I want to create multiple instances. 
Great question! As a general rule of thumb, you _do not_ want to be creating your objects that way (i.e. by giving each of them individual names). Instead, you'll usually want an enveloping loop or function around the object reference. That sounds a lot more complicated than it really is, so here's an example: Dim studentList as New List(of student) For n = 1 to 100 Dim student as new student() student.id = n studentList.Add(student) Next In the above example, we created 100 student objects, each with an id that runs sequentially from 1 to 100. Notice however that none of them have individual variable names. Instead, whenever we want a particular student object, we'll trawl through studentList to find the student object we want and then retrieve it that way; which, coincidentally, is exactly what this function will do. Public Function getStudent(id as integer) as student For Each student in studentList If student.id = id then Return student Next Return Nothing End Function So if we wanted student Bob, with an id of 64, we can just refer to him this way: getStudent(64) I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out how to modify that function to retrieve students based on names, classes and so on instead of just by id. It's very simple and just requires a modified version of the same getStudent function. --- So let's say you have a text file that looks like this: Bob,16,3A Sally,16,3B Where Bob's age is 16 and his class is 3A, and Sally's age is 16 and her class is 3B. We'll want to create student objects based on that data. Now, assuming we can trust that the values are always going to be in that order, we can write a function that does exactly that: Public Function buildStudents(pathname as String) as List(of student) Dim total as New List(of student) Using parser As New TextFieldParser(pathname) parser.SetDelimiters(",") While parser.EndOfData = False Dim currentLine As String() = parser.ReadFields If currentLine(0) &lt;&gt; "" Then Dim student as new student student.name = currentLine(0) student.age = currentLine(1) student.class = currentLine(2) total.Add(student) End If End While End Using Return total End Function What that function basically does is use VB's built-in TextFieldParser to construct an array of string for each line in the text file. So this line in the text file: Bob,16,3A Gets transformed into an array of string by TextFieldParser where string(0) = "Bob", string(1) = "16" and string(2) = "3A". Using that information, we can then create the student object for Bob without once ever using a unique variable name for that. I know the above is a little overwhelming, but if you have any questions, hit me up!
You're talking about design patterns, which is something that everyone has a different opinion on. However, generally speaking, the "best way" to code something is "anything that makes your code easy to read and understand". As long as something makes sense to you, then it's acceptable code. For now, don't worry too much about efficiency. Focus more on understanding programming from a big picture level, and just keep working at it. Efficiency and best practices will come with time and experience. Good luck!
Name variables descriptive names. You should be able to tell what they're for by the name. Operate with consistency. Nothing is more frustrating than working with inconsistent code. If you're doing something a certain way, stick with it. (This applies to camel casing as well) Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a magical thing. It's what prevents VB from regressing back into a massive waterfall of code. It's also what prevents any code from turning into spaghetti. When something needs fixing, it's easy to identify, and fix. If it were spaghetti code, you'd be lost attempting to rewrite half of your code just to get things working again.
(╯ಠ_ಠ）╯︵ ┻━┻
Thanks! I'll try to keep on with that first. I probably really worried to much about this...
What do blondes and spaghetti have in common? They both wiggle when you eat them.
what you're talking about here is premature optimization. you can spend a lot of time making some code the best it can possibly be, and the minuscule CPU time saved in production will take years to recoup the effort you spent making it. as long as someone can come in years later (including future you) and understand what the code does without question, it's good enough code. you can always tweak for performance later if it really matters. 
One of the most important aspects of coding is removing redundancy. If you have code that basically does the exact same thing in multiple places, offload that code to a function. For example: Private Sub doITotal(t as Integer) ' Get total for n For i = 0 to t n += i Next ' Print out total Label1.text = "Round 1: " &amp; n &amp; vbCRLF ' Now total i again for round 2 For i = 0 to t n += i Next ' Print out total Label1.text = "Round 2: " &amp; n &amp; vbCRLF End Sub Here the for loop is listed twice. That's redundant. The above code would be written better with a function: Private Sub doITotal(t as integer) Dim nRounds as integer = 2 For i = 0 to nRounds Label1.Text = "Round " &amp; i &amp; ": " &amp; addI(t) &amp; vbCRLF Next End Sub Private Function addI(t as Integer) as Integer For i = 0 to t totalI += i Next End Function This example is obviously simplified. But even after programming for 25 years, I still find ways to cut redundancy in my code. Some people recommend the first version of the code in order to keep the code simple and easy to understand, but I find it inefficient, and that bugs me. 
if the text out of pdftotext comes out with a space, you need to change it there. maybe there's a command line flag?

When testing this, the only thing I had to change was to declare the i variable. This appears to work as intended.
try using a negative cypher of ... -2 and encrypting a. I want it to roll over back to y but instead it outputs "-" looping back from z works fine but the reverse doesn't work at all. 
Formatted for readability: Dim MyNumberArray(9) As Integer Dim Numbers As String Private Sub frmMain_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Randomly chooses 10 numbers that are between 1 and 3 For x = 0 To MyNumberArray.Count - 1 MyNumberArray(x) = (Int(Rnd(1) * 3)) Numbers = MyNumberArray(x) Next End Sub Private Sub btnStart_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnStart.Click 'Adds the numbers to the list lstNumbers.Items.Add(Numbers) End Sub I recommend combining all of your code into the button event. This would run everything with a single click of the button. Inversely, you can combine everything into the form load event, resulting in not needing to click the button at all.
This part of a series that uses models to help beginners. "Execution space" is a simplified description of memory, register, stack and heap areas used to store data that is 'manipulated' by instructions. "Sending a message" derives from UML diagrams that model an executing object oriented program and shows messages being passed from a sending to a receiving object. The center of the object is a non technical description of encapsulation and is derived from work done by Pressman where data is regarded as encapsulated within an object 'surrounded' by methods. The terminology here is to prepare a student for designing programs using UML artefacts where the notion of sending messages is key to the design.
I mean.like whatever the length in.column A is. I want the to be the length of my M:Y auto fill
Interesting Problem... I think you were just missing some IF statements to check if it exceeds the range a-z/A-Z. Module Cypher Sub Main() Console.WriteLine(getEncrypt("xyz", 1)) Console.WriteLine(getEncrypt("abc", 1)) Console.WriteLine(getEncrypt("ABC", -1)) Console.WriteLine(getEncrypt("XaB", 3)) Console.WriteLine(getEncrypt("XaB", 1000)) Console.Read() End Sub Function getEncrypt(strSentence As String, cypher As Integer) As String Dim encryptedstring As String = "" For Each letter In strSentence.ToCharArray encryptedstring &amp;= Chr(EncryptLetterAndWrap(Asc(letter), cypher Mod 26)) Next Return encryptedstring End Function Function EncryptLetterAndWrap(n As Integer, cypher As Integer) As Integer If n &lt; 123 And n &gt; 96 Then ' Lowercase If n + cypher &gt; 122 Then Return n + cypher - 26 ElseIf n + cypher &lt; 97 Then Return n + cypher + 26 Else Return n + cypher End If ElseIf n &lt; 91 And n &gt; 64 Then ' Uppercase If n + cypher &gt; 90 Then Return n + cypher - 26 ElseIf n + cypher &lt; 65 Then Return n + cypher + 26 Else Return n + cypher End If End If Return n End Function End Module
why do you have variables if they're not actually being used? that could get you marked down. also use decimals for currency calculations, not doubles 
Excuse the late reply. I appreciate the help. Cheers! 
Is this homework? 
Did you read the sidebar? Homework questions are tolerated, please be specific about the questing as much a possible. Asking us to write it for you is not going to happen. We also reserve the right to not answer if we think you are just not trying.
Very well. Can you refer to the comment below which gave a good description of the notions you need for this particular problem, and comment the resulting code? We will help from there. 
Surely here you want to declare the input inside the Do loop then have if statements say if input = "a" do sound then elseif input = "something else" do something else, and have elseif input = "exit" to exit the loop as you wanted (use exit do in this case), because looking at this your logic is unclear to me. For example: &gt;Do &gt;dim input as Char &gt;Console.writeline("Enter a letter to hear a sound, enter E to exit") &gt;input = console.readline() &gt;If input = "x" do sound &gt;elseif input = "other x" do another sound &gt;elseif input = "E" exit do &gt;else console.writeline("wrong input") &gt;loop In this example the user will be asked to input a letter to play corresponding sound which then input takes this value, and will keep being asked until they enter E to exit the loop.
Why not use My.Resources.&lt;filename&gt; ? 
Are the rtf files included as part of the project when it's published? Have you verified that they are in the resources folder after install? 
Yes, they are part of the project when published. I've done a few different such checks.
You need to read the whole file, or at least read it line by line until you get to the line that matters to you. A text file isn't a database, so you can't just say "get me the line that starts with x". Even if you could, the process would still involve reading each line until it finds the match. You could consider not using text files, but using XML files which can be more directly queried. Or INI files, which can have "sections" which you can easily read directly from. This all depends on if you have control over the source text file or not.
How did you publish? ClickOnce?
Yes! That's it. Now its working even after publishing. Unfortunately, it seems now my database is broken. I get the same message but this time it says it can't find my database... which it can, once I click past the error message and start saving records.
what type of database file is it? access?
Having a double click on a button goes against pretty much all design principles. If you REALLY want to (but again for the love of all things holy please don't), you need to create your own button class, inherit from the base button class, and set the StandardClick and StandardDoubleClick control style flags to true. Public Class DoubleClickableButton Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Button Public Sub New() MyBase.New() Me.SetStyle(ControlStyles.StandardClick, True) Me.SetStyle(ControlStyles.StandardDoubleClick, True) End Sub End Class
Yeah, it's an access file that is imported into the project. It works fine when in debug mode or running the .exe straight from bin/release. This is the error I get as soon as I open the app: http://imgur.com/BvRdapX Also, when I try to close the app from a treeview... thing, like this: ElseIf e.Node.Name = "ExitNode" Then Me.Close() I get the below error: http://imgur.com/N55uaKE None of which are present if I run the app from Visual studio or from the debug or release folders. 
Post what your connection string looks like for your database. It should just be application.startuppath &amp; "\yourdbfile.accdb"
Properties&gt; full path: D:\Course\Paul\_Main Project\PlumbingApp\PlumbingApp\Quotes.mdb Not sure if I've found the right thing, but the above is what I get when I go into solution explorer and check the properties of my database "Quotes.mdb" In publish&gt;Application Files&gt; PlumbingApp_1_0_0_3 I do have `Quotes.mdb.deploy` which I would have thought would be fine. Once I click past the error message, I do seem to be editing some sort of database. My school is making me do this project on VB 2008, so .accdb is not compatible. 
I pretty much do that already for the bulk of the data in the beginning and end of the file, but I have to be fairly granular for the parts in the middle that I'm directly working with. There are 264 bytes of data (roughly, varies with length of the 2 strings), and I only understand about 112 bytes of it, interspersed throughout. Also, even though I don't know what the data means, it's fairly handy to be able to have the columns showing what the unknown data is so I can see if there's a pattern when comparing to the known stuff. Switching to a byte array for these smaller chunks would also mean that the DGV wouldn't be displaying everything relevant for each entry, so adding new stuff would need to be handled different instead of expecting the user to just copy the values from whichever entry looks the most similar and hoping it works. I guess what I'm mostly looking for is a convenient way to track 66 pieces of data without manually defining 66 columns, and importing/exporting individually based upon their data type. Right now, I'm working on creating an 'msbdata' class with 2 public lists, fieldNames and fieldTypes. I'll use this more or less as header data for a byte array that I'll build on the fly as I read in/out data. I think it'll work, but it still feels like there should be a better way.
Assuming the 3 words represent the 3 variables you declared for that class?
Yes, but I actually just figured it out! strReadingFile is the file where I'm reading from's location. Dim objReader As New System.IO.StreamReader(strReadingFile) Dim ItemList As New List(Of Potions) Dim PotionInfo As New Potions Dim lines() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines(strReadingFile) For Each line As String In lines Dim intId As Integer Dim dblBottleVolume As Double Dim strTime As String Dim words() As String = line.Split(New Char() {vbTab}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) intId = words(0) dblBottleVolume = words(1) strTime = words(2) PotionInfo.FillPotions(intId, dblBottleVolume, strTime) ItemList.Add(PotionInfo) Next
Thanks, I get the concept now. I was able to implement this for the .rtf files. Do you know how I might be able to set up the db so that its file path is as you showed? My school teacher showed me this: Data &gt; Add new data source&gt; Database &gt; New connection &gt; (add your .mdb file) &gt; test connection &gt; select tables &gt; finish. I don't know how to edit the filepath for the actual database. This might be quite dumb but I tried [this](http://imgur.com/0cnfHnr). How do I change the connection string to be at application startup. The .mdb file is in the root folder of the project, along with the forms etc BTW, thank you so much for your help. My own teacher has given me less of his time on this project than you have. I really appreciate at. I'll pay this forward to others who need help with their code.
Well if you went about it that way, are you working with datasets? So that you ended up with the mdb file and an xsd file as part of your project?
You would need to post the code in question for anyone to be able to tell you what logic errors are making it behave the way it is. As to timers there are dozens of general use examples, like [this one](http://vb.net-informations.com/gui/timer-vb.htm). Timers don't do a whole lot of things, basically just one. They raise an event at the specified time interval, to allow whatever code you have in their tick event to run. Want some code to run every minute? Every second? 10 times a second? Use a timer.
&gt;How are you going about opening a connection to the database in code so that you can access it? As my teacher showed it, I set the QuotesDataSet table "quotes" to details view in the data sources menu, and dragged it into the form. The below code was generated by visual studio as a result. This is in the form load procedure. 'TODO: This line of code loads data into the 'QuotesDataSet.quotes' table. You can move, or remove it, as needed. Me.QuotesTableAdapter.Fill(Me.QuotesDataSet.quotes) When I first started this thread the issue with the database did not exist, it was only the .rtf files not opening. I must have changed something after that. Not sure what though.
He's not even using the StreamReader object, he's using the File class's built-in reading function. OP, you can get rid of the objReader declaration.
For the buttons, you'll need to check the if-then clauses every time something's updated. This can be either stuffed into the main game loop - eg through a sub that's checked every second or so - or whenever the user does something, like click a button. Like /u/kleinma said, timers just raise an event every X seconds. Whatever function or sub you want fired should be raised by said event.
I [gave you the answer yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualbasic/comments/43vbt5/using_double_click_to_open_a_new_windows/). Why are you asking for the same thing again? There isn't an easier way to do it. Buttons don't raise double click events unless you force them to. For good reason too. No one expects to have to double click a button. Only single click.
The problem does seems to lie in your conditionals, which is comparing the whole string with a letter. If stringVar(Index).toUpper() = "A" Then
Thank you very much thats what I was missing, also, how does one do newline in visual basic? do I just type console.writline("Hello/newline World")? edit: just figured it out its string text &amp; vbNewLine &amp; string text
You can also use vbCrlf to force a line break!
Just some advice, but if you want something to be evaluated, post the source code. You might have the best of intentions, but you aren't going to get lots of people to download a random exe and run it on their systems. It also helps since people here are more likely going to want to give you feedback on your actual code, not what the program looks like.
You may find the following code more helpful: Dim A As Date A = TimeSerial(10, 10, 10) Selection.TypeText Text:=CStr(A) &amp; vbNewLine A = DateAdd("S", 10, A) Selection.TypeText Text:=CStr(A) 
Ok, thanks for your advice! I dont really want to upload my code here
Conway's Game of Life is pretty fun to program. I believe the wikipedia article below is pseudo-code free too, but contains all the rules. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life
I'm on Mobile, When I get home and this hasn't been answered, I'll look into it (I'm an amateur as well so it won't look far off from your code)
did and deployed it very happy with the result.....every time i open it it downloads the latest release from the server
Very, Provide what you have, and we will help.
I would go with the last comment i.e. the game of life. You have a specification that needs to be solved as an algorithm and then implemented in VB. You can also add to the specification by having the first generation read from files and you can arrange for more than one starting pattern to be stored in a file or files. It will also allow you to experiment with 2d arrays for a generation and a 3d array for storing generations. You can also store generations in files. It will also allow you to decide on appropriate classes to implement aspects of the specification. There are also lots of solutions out there in other languages and you could convert them to VB.
See this on app.config. That is where you set it and can make your program adjustable by modifying the settings http://mobile.codeguru.com/columns/vb/working-with-configuration-files-and-visual-basic.htm
为了响应：在设计窗口大小调整我的主要形式问题。 您是否尝试过拉伸的形式？我不认为你错过任何设置。我认为这是它应该是的方式。
I'll take a look for that setting. I'll let you know if it works. Thanks!
What is your laptops dpi set to?
I am really glad you brought that up. After reviewing my settings it looks like I was set to 200% more than my PC on all windows. After adjusting it to ~140% it makes the windows appear correct without making everything too small to read on my laptop screen. Thank you for the help guys!
You can use a Select Case statement to filter out your valid numbers from everything else.
Im really new to vb any idea how with pictures if possible?
You should really look into the VB.Net Random class instead of the old vb6 ways of creating a random number. But as to your actual question. Create a counter inside your While loop that increments each time and use a variable as your max range for the random number. Then when the counter reaches an amount, change the variable for the max range of your random. Something like: Dim MaxNum as Integer = 100 Dim counter as Integer = 0 while correctanswer counter +=1 if counter &gt; 5 then counter = 0 ' reset the counter MaxNum += 100 'increase the max range to 200 console.writeline("Questions just got harder") end if firstNumber = CInt(Int((MaxNum* Rnd()) + 1)) secondNumber = CInt(Int((MaxNum* Rnd()) + 1)) ... the rest of your code End While So for every 5 correct answers the random range is increased by 100 making it harder as you go. You could also save yourself a lot of duplicate code by passing in the users choice into the function (in other words instead of add() and multi() just call it performtest() and pass in the correctness and userchoice. Then before you display the problem, you can use an if statement to see if you need to display a multiplication problem or an addition problem. You could even go as far as to set option 3 to either so that if it's option 3 perform a random to see if you ask a multiplication question or an addition question each time.
there's probably an API for that, but the better way is to make a vba function that takes parameters that you can call from VB.
Editing the VBA code while it is running is not really going to be a possibility, rather than change the code, have the code see the user's inputs as data. If the user has typed input somewhere on the Word document, it is possible to access the paragraphs in the document, (perhaps by searching for key words) and then have your code act based on what is found. There are several ways of doing this, including setting up data entry fields within the document that the user is required to fill, or, searching all the text of the document, or even by popping up input boxes and message boxes which ask yes/no questions. It is possible to have a single Word document with embedded VBA code that opens another document and acts on the contents of that other document. I suppose if you gave a better description of what you were interested in doing, I could be more specific.
You should jest have to copy the relevant dlls to the target directory along with the Exe to make that all work. If you need, change your references output property (for each reference) to "copy always"
Dictionary as your collection/enumeration type probably isn't the ideal option here - using a List(Of T) or Collection(Of T) would be better as it would allow you to easily enumerate (loop through) the data easily. For the sub assemblies, you are passing in the same dictionary both times - you need to create a new sub assemblies collection, fill it, and then pass it in: Dim sub = new SubAssemblies(... Etc) products.add("wagon", sub) Sub = new SubAssemblies(... Etc) Products.add("truck", sub) 
Thank you for the response! With a list or collection, would I be able to connect all the lists? The project is about learning how to make that connection. I chose dictionary because I can have a key of truck that holds all the other dictionaries. 
Thanks guys I managed to solve the issue. Just had to write the VBA code call to accept a parameter. User input will be through the VB application's interface.
PM me if you have any questions.
I was steered towards auto hot key in /r/programming it seems pretty similar. I've made this http://p.ahkscript.org/?p=89a43f14 Have yet to test it in game but if it gives me too hard of a time i'll take a look at autoit. Thanks for the suggestion! Edit: this is the newer version http://p.ahkscript.org/?p=5b510c7f
Visual Studio 2015 has the same VB.NET templates for Universal Apps that C# does. The Visual Basic compiler was just rewritten from scratch in Visual Basic by the product team at Microsoft. No it isn't dead. C# tends to get more support for certain things (for example unity game engine integration), but no VB is not dead.
As a hobbyist, VB is still a good choice. Microsoft takes longer to release VB then C# templates for beta software, but they are supposed to be on par by RTM. In the professional world you should avoid it. VB developers get paid less and have fewer job opportunities even though they more or do exactly the same work as C# developers.
On the contrary, most seasoned vb developers can read and write c# just fine while c# developers often can't program efficiently in vb. There are lots of existing software applications out there built in vb that need maintaining, or in some cases need to be ported to c#. I currently do consulting for a company whose software is written in vb and is used by organizations such as Exxon and NASA. End users don't care what something is written in.
That's surprising to me. Last time I looked, a couple years ago, that wasn't the case.
vb6 is easier to learn than C#, I don't feel like vb.net is.
Try teaching some a C style for loop vs. a VB style loop.
I have. C style is actually easier to teach if you explain it right. especially when you start getting into Step and complex break conditions.
Are you talking about the IDE or the runtime/applications themselves? I will assume the IDE, and I would say there is little to no chance of that happening. I can at least tell you I have never even heard it talked about, but conversation usually is focused on looking forward there. I guess not impossible if they ever wanted to open source it, which they have been coming around to more recently. While the runtimes are still shipping with Windows and supported for a number more years, all official support for the IDE ended some years back (2008).
It is, but as far as what makes it into the VB language spec for each new number version of VB. As in what is going to ship with Visual Studio, is all going to be decided on and implemented by Microsoft, at least that is still what the current status quo is. I have no idea if that is slated to change any time soon.
Can you provide a quick n' dirty code sample of each to demonstrate the difference? I'm curious.
VB For x = 1 to 10 Step 2 Console.Writeline(x) Next C# for (var x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x += 2) { Console.Writeline(x); } Just explaining when to use semi-colons and when to not can tale awhile. And then you need to explain how var creates a variable, the difference between the comparison in part 2 and the incrementor in part 3. 
asp.net core will eventually support VB.net correct? I like that MS is starting down the open-source road. In my opinion, I think VB could actually attract python programmers more so than C#. I know some python users prefer the human readable syntax over the more verboseness of C#.
If you run the code and pause by using a breakpoint, your converted value for *day* is #12/30/1899 12:xx:xx AM#, which is a Saturday. Dim year As Integer = CInt(Console.ReadLine) Dim day As Date = New DateTime(year, 2, 14) Console.Writeline("{0}, February 14, {1}", day.ToString("dddd"), year.ToString) Console.Read() http://www.dotnetperls.com/fromoadate https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xcfzdy4x(v=vs.110).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-2 **Edit:** The third line may also be written as: Console.WriteLine(Format(day, "dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy")) https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.110).aspx
Are you unable to create a flow chart of the code you just created? Not being a douche about it, but you are only making a statement. Not really asking any questions for anyone to answer.
Yes, VB.NET support should be coming. No specifics on when, but Microsoft has always stated that it doesn't support VB.NET *yet* (among other languages like F#), so it should find its way there as the product matures. 
runtime works fine, the changes to make apps not require running as admin were pretty trivial. the IDE is the pain. I don't even care about it being open sourced, I know there's a lot of challenges in that. to be specific, the main pain is anything that does office integration. I have a few apps that have as a very minor feature the ability to pump data into excel. if anything at all needs changed I can no longer test it in debug, I have to compile. we don't have $1M in man hours to port these apps to something else just to improve this pain.
This may not work for your specific scenario, but a few years back I had to do some work for someone in VB6, and my development machine was Windows 7x64. I ended up installing XP Mode (the free Windows XP virtual machine license) for Windows 7, and installed the VB6 IDE on that so I didn't need a second dev machine, and didn't have to deal with the pain points of trying to run VB6 IDE on a modern OS.
Since I may need to rewrite the file, I'd like to avoid that if possible. 
And that's what I just figured out... Not 5 minutes after posting... And spending a couple hours this morning trying to figure it out.
Thank you, much appreciated
Ah yes, VBForums. Still a great place for VB help. I stay pretty busy these days, but I am still a moderator over there and check in when I can. Glad to hear I was able to help you out!!
Do you have a question?
Yes. I need help for the Sort Procedure() that repeatedly finds the lowest value in an array A, removes it and adds it to array T. When all the values of A have been moved, the elements of T are copied to A with an assignment and a loop. Use the find Lowest index function: I created all the other functions and the main program
Hey quick question, what are the {0} and {1} for?
There are two types of posts on this group, and they get two different responses. One type of post is where people try to do something, get stuck at a certain point, and then post a question (usually with a small amount of relevant code) asking how to solve a very specific problem. Then there are posts like yours. You haven't tried anything. AT ALL. You didn't even post your code and you expect us to help you finish your homework. You don't have a problem that you need help with, you want us to do your homework. So you can guess which type of questions I'm going to stop doing billable work to help (you do understand that many of us that post help here are actual software developers, who do this for a living right?). "I need help" isn't going to cut it. What part specifically doesn't work? Does any of it work? What don't you understand about the assignment? Lets see if I can explain this differently (This is the general attitude you'll find in development discussion groups all over the internet. ): I'm super happy to help people that want to learn to program, and put some effort into solving problems, even if it's helping with homework. I won't help people pass a class they don't care about. I'm not saying that you are in the latter group, but when you post like this that's what you appear to be (whining about it doesn't help either). BTW, I'm 43 years old and don't give even a single little fuck about internet points.
Using a form allows you to get into the event driven aspect of VB. That would be the biggest difference between Form driven applications, and console applications.
3 of how many? and always these 2?
Not always these two, guy choose 3 toppings on a pizza out of 5. 
VB uses `And`. `&amp;` is a bitwise operator, not a comparator, and using bitwise on booleans is kind of nonsense. also the `= True` is not required as .Checked is already a boolean. if you're going to use `= True` use it on all 3 conditions. what I would do if you want "select any 3, disable the other 2" is to use a control array instead of named controls, then you can use a loop to count how many are selected, and if it =3 then do another loop to hide all the unchecked ones. you can still do that logic without an array but you're going to need a whole lot of IFs. 
Yes it would be nicer to still have them visible. Thanks
This worked for me: Note: Added all checkboxes to a GroupBox labeled "Toppings" Get the number of Checked boxes for validation: Private Function CheckedBoxes() As Integer Dim checkCount As Integer = 0 ' Note: Name &amp; Property are case sensitive For Each c As Control In Me.GroupBox1.Controls If c.GetType.Name = "CheckBox" AndAlso c.GetType.GetProperty("Checked").GetValue(c, Nothing) = True Then checkCount += 1 Next Return checkCount End Function Sub to Hide remaining Unchecked boxes: Private Sub HideBoxes() For Each c As Control In Me.GroupBox1.Controls If c.GetType.Name = "CheckBox" AndAlso c.GetType.GetProperty("Checked").GetValue(c, Nothing) = False Then c.Visible = False Next End Sub Sub to Show hidden Boxes: Private Sub ShowBoxes() For Each c As Control In Me.GroupBox1.Controls If c.GetType.Name = "CheckBox" AndAlso c.GetType.GetProperty("Visible").GetValue(c, Nothing) = False Then c.Visible = True Next End Sub One event handler to rule them all: Private Sub cbChicken_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles cbChicken.CheckedChanged, cbMeatball.CheckedChanged, cbMushrooms.CheckedChanged, cbCheese.CheckedChanged, cbPepperoni.CheckedChanged If CheckedBoxes() &gt;= 3 Then HideBoxes() Else ShowBoxes() End Sub Perhaps not the most efficient, but it works nicely for me. [Screen Shot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3rncgalmu68g4ti/Screen.png?dl=0) ETA: This will also allow the addition of more checkboxes. The visibility property could also be changed out with the Enabled property.
If there are 3 out of 5 checkboxes being used, and the ones you are disabling can change based on the selected checkboxes, I recommend using an additional variable/procedure for this. Dim CheckCounter As Byte 'In Each Checkbox Event If ThisCheckbox.Checked = True Then CheckCounter = CheckCounter + 1 Else CheckCounter = CheckCounter - 1 End If Call UpdateCheckboxes Private Sub UpdateCheckboxes() If CheckCounter &gt;= 3 Then If CheckBox1.Value = False Then: CheckBox1.Enabled = False If CheckBox2.Value = False Then: CheckBox2.Enabled = False If CheckBox3.Value = False Then: CheckBox3.Enabled = False If CheckBox4.Value = False Then: CheckBox4.Enabled = False If CheckBox5.Value = False Then: CheckBox5.Enabled = False Else If CheckBox1.Enabled = False Then: CheckBox1.Enabled = True If CheckBox2.Enabled = False Then: CheckBox2.Enabled = True If CheckBox3.Enabled = False Then: CheckBox3.Enabled = True If CheckBox4.Enabled = False Then: CheckBox4.Enabled = True If CheckBox5.Enabled = False Then: CheckBox5.Enabled = True End If End Sub What this does is establish a running total of checkboxes that are checked. If a checkbox becomes checked, it adds 1 to the counter. If it's unchecked, it subtracts one. Every time the checkboxes are changed, they all call the UpdateCheckboxes procedure. This is what disables all the checkboxes if they happen to be unchecked if the counter is greater than or equal to 3. It is also what enables the checkboxes if the counter is less than 3, allowing users to select more checkboxes again.
Thats perfect, I had something similar worked out in my head but couldn't get the wording correct for it. Thanks
Holy crap, that FindLowest function is sure giving itself a lot of trouble to get that index, isn't it? Function FindLowest(arr As Integer()) As Integer Dim min = Integer.MaxValue Dim minIndex = 0 For i = 0 To arr.Length - 1 If arr(i) &lt; min Then min = arr(i) minIndex = i ' Make note of index while we're at it... End If Next Return minIndex End Function 
u mad bro? i actually tried all afternoon to solve this problem. and you are the kind of people i try to avoid. you don't even want to help, you want to say you are better or something. this is no homework, i'm trying to learn something new. and you are not making it anything more fun.
&gt; If CheckBox1.Value = False Then: CheckBox1.Enabled = False Any idea why value is getting an error? Error 1 'value' is not a member of 'System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox'. 
Thank you very much.
I ended up using ViperSRT3g code, as it was the easiest for me to understand, for the moment...
Assigning the key, i'm not sure where to start. I have multiple forms and would like the esc key as a back button
Not sure about your second problem, but last time I had to deal with a hanging application I had to learn multi-threading. Running your process on a second thread allows your application to remain active.
Yep this one is easy thanks.
Tried this but can't quite get my head around on how it works and didn't work for me
You'll have to code the paste function yourself by parsing the content of the clipboard. Here's a detailed article with info on how to do it: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36850/DataGridView-Copy-and-Paste It's in C#, but should be pretty straight forward. If you aren't comfortable reading C# yet, you can run the code through a converter: http://converter.telerik.com/

Is this just for yourself (all console apps on your own machine), or for the current console (current program for this instance of the console)? If it's the first, then you can just change the defaults for the console in Windows: http://superuser.com/questions/965086/change-the-default-console-window-font-in-windows-10 If it's the latter, then you can use some very poorly documented API calls to mess with the current console: http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/pavely/2009/07/23/changing-console-fonts/
The first of the 2 options worked perfectly. Thank you.
No. If you want an embedded database, have a look at SQLite.

VBA and Visual Studio don't really go together. VBA is Visual Basic for Applications, and it was a subset of VB specifically written to extend and automate functionality of Microsoft Office applications. VBA is programmed directly from the Office applications using their built in VBA code editors. Visual Studio on the other hand is the IDE for programming languages like VB.NET, C#, C++, etc.. Visual Studio has templates for Office plugins, but these are still very different from VBA. So you need to clarify what it is you are actually looking to do.
Based on this last statement, you're not coding in VBA at all. Sounds like you're going to make a Windows Forms Visual Basic application. I'm not sure what you could demonstrate to them for them to let you loose. Sounds like that would be more of their job. The question is so open-ended. I suppose you could develop a sample application with multiple tiers and a deployment package, or click-once deployment. To demonstrate how you'd get it on PCs and support the application. Perhaps connect it to git source control to demonstrate you know the concepts of that.
What exactly are you trying to do? Because, whatever it is, I can guarantee that this is not the way to do it. This is not the way to do anything.
For starters, your fnInitializeFields is useless because you are creating a new instance of Fields when you call that, but you already have an instance of fields Public Shared FieldsInstance As New Fields You also don't assign fnInitializeFields return value to anything anyway, so it is just a wasted call that does nothing. The other problem is in your fnFindByName sub. You are creating a new instance of field in that selectedindexchanged event, and then passing that to your fnFindByName function. Then you are relying on the .Contains() method to look for duplicates. Well contains is going to do an object comparison. This means it is only going to return true when you pass in the exact same object instance of a field class, not just one that happens to have the same sName value. That means it will never tell me that "Field already exists!" Try this: Public Class Fields Inherits System.ComponentModel.BindingList(Of Field) ' Public property of the class that functions as the access of the single instance Public Shared FieldsInstance As New Fields ' Constructor is protected so it can't be called Protected Sub New() End Sub Public Sub fnFindByName(oPassedField As Field) Dim DupFound As Boolean = False For Each F As Field In FieldsInstance If F.sName = oPassedField.sName Then 'NAME ALREADY EXISTS DupFound = True Exit For End If Next If Not DupFound Then FieldsInstance.Add(oPassedField) Else MessageBox.Show("Field already exists!") End If End Sub End Class
What about when the first form is loaded and the sound, no matter how many forms I switch, keeps playing?

Anything I can do to get more elevator music playing I am all for helping ;)
Okay, what did you need help with? I see above you've got the top-right bit working. If you want it to be 'portable', just copy the .exe from the debug folder (or put VS in release mode and do a build), don't follow the whole 'publish' route that VS has
Won't happen. Even if it did, the only reason VB6 is still kicking around is because of legacy apps that rely heavily on COM and won't work right in a browser without major rewriting. 
Thank you! This has worked amazingly for me. Just one follow up question if I may, do you know if I can display the properties of the FieldsInstance? I basically want access to the sNames within. I've tried binding a listbox's datasource like this: Form.lstbox.DataSource = Fields.FieldsInstance Form.lstbox.DisplayMember= Fields.FieldsInstance.ToString But this is only displaying "projName.Field" in the listbox.
Yep... two issues that those continually asking to have the VB6 source opened don't seem to get ... 1. For these types of projects (doing something new with the VB6 syntax): it won't do any good at all. Almost none of the code would be useful, and what would (text editors) can be replaced with better open source editors, or even the current version of Visual Studio (that has the ability to handle custom languages and compilers). Almost none of VB6 compiler code would be usable for this project. 2. For moving VB6 forward ... It's all written in C++ or even lower level stuff. I'd guess that there are very few in the "clinging to VB6" community that are capable of doing the work to make it anything more than it is right now. 
When you add an object to something like a listbox, it will call that objects .ToString() method to get a string to represent that object in the control. So you need to override the .ToString() method of your Field class, and have it output what you would like to see. So basically you would add this code to your Field class definition: Public Overrides Function ToString() As String Return Me.sName End Function 
VB.NET WinForms does quicker and easier RAD development. Name one thing that is somehow easier or better that VB6 does versus VB.NET?
This should do what you want: Dim regex As New System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex(",(?! )") ' negative zero-width lookahead Dim split As String() = regex.Split("a,b, c")
Welp, depending upon the complexity of your calculator, you can do everything with three variables. First and second variables interact to produce the result which is stored in the third variable. Going with the method described above, you'd store the entered number into the first variable when you click an operation button. Then the second number would be stored into the second variable when hitting the equal sign, and the math would output the result into the final variable for display.
Here is why I love vb6 and wont give it up. Its a simple clean light weight language. The IDE starts up like a flash, as do debug sessions. Compiled executables are native and give good performance. They can not be decompiled and are not defacto open source. The language has not been academically abstracted away into hundreds of classes and does not require long drawn out lines of code to access object after object to complete a single task. When debugging, I can set a breakpoint and edit just about anything without a debugger reset. Including code in other functions. The message pump on the form continues to run at breakpoints so I can see output. VB6 was created by pretty much gods of Windows programming. They made super hard stuff trivially easy and did it with class. VB6 also integrates nicely with standard C and beautifully with COM. If I cant do something easily in vb6, I just switch gears, do it in C then integrate the two. I write research tools and use vb6 everyday. I am grateful that I am still using code written over a decade ago. I use C# now and again if there is a library for it that will save me allot of time, but mostly it sits on the side. I want raw access to memory and data structures without any extra layers in between. I dont want to accept all those extra startup delays every debug session or application startup. Regardless of OS, I need vb6 as a tool to do the types of processing my job entails. It lets me have more tools in less time with less typing and is perfectly capable of performing the tasks I require of it. I like the balance they struck between light weight, speed, and quick development. .Net attributes are not as suitable for my tasks.

I've run VB6 on windows 10.
&gt;Not sure why the button click isn't causing focus to be lost and validation even to fire for the textbox. I'm really not sure either, I've had users complain about it several times, and I'll go in and test it, and can rarely reproduce the issue. But I have reproduced it, so I know it's a real thing. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I only thought to ask the question because I was updating an unrelated thing and I noticed it happened to me. Me.ValidateChildren Um... Awesome! I did not know about this call. I haven't been able to reproduce the problem since adding this, so hopefully this is it, a fix for something that's been an annoyance for years, haha. Thanks /u/kleinma 
I knew that there were poor souls out there who still have to maintain VB6 applications because there are no will and resources for a rewrite, but I wasn't aware that anyone was masochistic enough to *voluntarily* use it for new development.
Well, then I must drop this compilation of thoughts: https://www.docdroid.net/s87b/bill-gates-phd-thesis.pdf.html read this too: http://vb6awards.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-disinformation-propaganda-on-real.html http://vb6awards.blogspot.com/2016/02/must-read-articles.html :)

LOL. May be the worst named column I have ever seen.
If you're using VB.NET, then this seems like a perfect use for [LINQ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb763068.aspx). You could probably do this more efficiently, but I'm going to keep it more basic and easier to read/understand, instead. LINQ is an **incredibly** valuable—maybe even ***in***valuable—tool to be able to use: --- Dim NameList = (From t in MyDataSet Select t.Name Distinct) ' Creates an enumerable collection of the unique ' names in the dataset to iterate through. ' Take each name and do the math: For Each n in NameList Dim TotalSales = (Aggregate t in MyDataSet Into Sum(t.OrderPrice) Where t.Name = n) [...Rinse &amp; repeat for Count &amp; Average...] [...do your stuff with the results...] Next n --- [Here's another page you might find useful that walks through putting together your first LINQ query.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384667.aspx) 
Get over yourself. Microsoft have been telling VB6 users to move to dotNet for nearly 15 years now. It ain't gonna happen. 
I posted another message using LINQ to get the totals, but here's another way of doing it without using LINQ. It might be easier for someone who's unfamiliar with LINQ Sub Main ' Let's create a "fake" dataset - and array of anonymous types Dim salesPersons = {New With {.Name = "Jim", .Amount = 100}, _ New With {.Name = "Jim", .Amount = 300}, _ New With {.Name = "Billy", .Amount = 250}, _ New With {.Name = "Bob", .Amount = 500}} ' We'll use a dictionary to group our sales Dim dic = New Dictionary(Of String, Total) ' We go through our salespersons... For Each sp In salespersons If dic.ContainsKey(sp.Name) Then ' We already have an entry, so we simply increase total, count ' and recalc the average Dim entry = dic(sp.Name) entry.Total += sp.Amount entry.Count += 1 entry.Average = entry.Total / entry.Count Else ' We haven't seen this name before, so we create a new ' item in our dictionary dic.Add(sp.Name, New total With {.Total = sp.Amount, .Count = 1, .Average = sp.Amount}) End If Next ' Here we now have a dictionary that contains a summary for each unique name... For Each entry In dic Console.WriteLine(entry.key &amp; " $" &amp; entry.Value.Total &amp; " " &amp; entry.Value.Count &amp; " $" &amp; entry.Value.Average) Next End Sub ' Small class we'll be using to hold our totals... Class Total Property Total As Integer Property Count As Integer Property Average As Double End Class
Nothing to get over. I was one of those users and I moved ..... and I agree completely that anyone that's happy building new stuff in VB6 isn't going to move to something else. My point is very simple: Those VB6 users aren't going to move to some new language that's "like VB6". If they were going to do that they would have already done it (since VB.NET is very much "like VB6"). Those users want VB6 and nothing more. There's no point in creating entirely new products from the ground up that have a "VB6 like language". 
Glad I could help.

Re: VB.NET was the same as VB6: That may be their opinion, but it's just not true (and never has been). .NET in the early 2000s gave us Libraries and Windows Forms (like VB6), but also gave us Windows Services, ASP.NET, and Mobile Apps (on Windows Mobile). You couldn't do the last three in VB6 (and couldn't share any code between the available tech at the time), but could in .NET. It also gave us true multi threading, reflection, generics, inheritance, etc (really the list of improvements is staggering). Hell, Visual Studio itself is / was worth the pain of switching to .NET. In the time since then we've gotten dozens of new targets, and thousands of improvements to the language / framework, including XNA games (for PC and XBox), modern ASP.NET (MVC), Silverlight, WPF, Windows Phone, Universal Windows Apps (and their predecessor on Windows 8), etc. All sharing the same code, or a lot of common code. And once you get your head wrapped around VB.NET, it's super simple to transition to C# where you can take advantage of Xamarin (writing apps once in C# that compile natively for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc), or switching to Mono where you can write Win Forms for Mac / Linux, or the Unity game engine that uses C# via Mono for it's scripting engine. The other benefit that VB.NET has that VB6 never did: The C# community ... it's massive, with a depth of knowledge that's simply staggering, and since VB.NET and C# both compile to IL, you can take advantage of the thousands of libraries available for C# that never existed for VB6 (you can even mix VB and C# projects in the same solutions). I wrote in VB5 and 6, so I came from the same place, and remember all of the FUD surrounding .NET when it first came out (and bought into a lot of it for a couple of years). I also had industry requirements that ruled out VB6 going forward (11+ years ago), and had to move to something different. At that time my options were C++, or VB.NET. The only regret I have is that I waited as long as I did to move fully to .NET, and that I wrote an additional 100k + LOC in VB6 that I'd have to maintain for another decade. We also didn't have to rewrite anything all at once. All of .NET can be exposed via COM, so as I migrated libraries to .NET I was able to still use them in VB6. MS also released tools that allowed us to consume .NET controls from VB6, so we spent over a decade rewriting small bits of our application as we had time, and embedding it into our VB6 system as we had time. It's also trivial to use COM objects in .NET, and you could use VB6 controls in .NET (you may still be able to, but I haven't looked in years), so doing conversions the other way was possible too. 
Replying to myself, since It appears we can't have multiple replies to a single post: Re: using HTML / JS as a replacement for VB6. While I do get the allure of this conceptually, it's a really poorly thought out solution. And it's been done already for several platforms. For really simple apps this might be fine, but you lose so much native access and speed (and all of the third party tooling for VB6). So much of the real power under VB6 is related to COM or required using the Windows API. Without those capabilities you'll dumb down VB6 substantially. Phone Gap / Cordova can already produce HTML / JS / CSS apps for most mobile platforms, but is never going to be as fast, look completely correct, or have the same power as native apps do. Mono tries native compilation with .NET on Mac/ Windows / Linux, and has lots of issues with cross platform items (as each platform has so many unique aspects). Most developers end up maintaining at least two versions of the same program (one for Windows using MS .NET, and one for Linux / Mac using Mono). Xamarin is really the closest to this type of system (compiled to native code per platform), and still requires that the last 30% of UI code be platform specific. The one thing that all of these products (and lots of others) have proven multiple times is that you either compile to native code (using native libraries), or you give up lots of power and speed to have a true multi platform app. For instance, disk IO is dramatically different on Linux / Mac than it is on Windows. Even Universal Windows apps have different rules and methods for accessing files and directories than desktop apps do. And phones have even different rules / methods for dealing with files. So you end up with a single IO library that has to know all of the various methods for dealing with file IO on dozens of versions of dozens of platforms. Complexity goes through the roof. And that's just one of hundreds of thousands of individual items that this new language will have to deal with, that are all vastly different from OS to OS (and version to version). And finally, again, none of this has anything to do with MS or VB6. The VB6 compiler source code won't help with this at all as VB6 is wrapped deeply around Win32 / COM. Anyone that wants to develop this can do it now. Just grab one of the various IDEs that can be extended (even Visual Studio can be extended to handle new languages), and get to work. Waiting for MS to do this is a waste of time. Even in .NET they've been clear that they aren't interested in cross platform development (although there's lots of speculation that they may buy Xamarin at some point). 
Windows Phone is dead. Windows Universal Apps are oxymoronic. dotNet is 15 year old technology. Stop trying to defend the indefensible. Time to move on. 
You gave me the idea to solve this.. Rather than ticker with the script, I used a program called Bulk Rename Utility and with a bit of regEX magic I was able to name the files 001, 010 and 100.
It is beginning to look as though the VB6 programming language will outlast VBdotNet, if not the entire dotNet framework. With Microsoft committing to support VB6 for the lifetime of Windows 10, and with the VBA programming language in Office, and VBScript in Windows it looks like VB6 will live forever.
&gt; The biggest complaint back when .net came out was the size of the runtime versus vb6's small runtime. Both now ship with windows so it is moot. No, the biggest complaint about dotNet has always been that it is unable to compile VB6 source code. You had to either rewrite or use a next-to-useless conversion tool. &gt;If you are going to learn any vb today it should be .net. dotNet is slowly reaching it's end-of-life. Not something you should start to learn now. 
That's not how this works...
NFS 3D Game made in Visual Basic 6.0 is an open source demo, it is a f..... 3D engine. But, I show you this one made in Visual Basic 6.0 !: http://vb6awards.blogspot.com/2016/02/unbelievable-3d-shooter-made-in-visual.html Show me a VB. NET code that can do what this VB6 project can do. And please, that javascript demo is your response ?! The reality is that VB.NET can not do what VB6 does. There is no degree of comparison between VB6 and VB dot NOT. Let me show you further what VB6 can do and VB. NET can not do (ever): 1) https://sourceforge.net/projects/visual-basic/?sourcFurthere=directory 2) https://sourceforge.net/projects/librycompiler/?source=directory https://sourceforge.net/u/visualbasic6/profile/ If you disagree, show me your code ! :) 
you need to use string concatenation in the loop to build out the chrName in full. you should probably also only do the ToLower after the loop, not in it.
i have the chrName = strBackwords.Chars(intindex) in my code but the name i put in the code is not coming up backwards. well its nor popping up at all
add a break point and step through to see what's happening. 
Ideally, use AndAlso which will short circuit on false and stop checking the additional checkboxes. A better way to go about it would also to create an array of your checkboxes and use a lambda function to check to make sure at least one is checked. Dim myCheckBoxes = {CheckBox1, CheckBox2, CheckBox3} If myCheckBoxes.All(Function(CB) Not CB.Checked) Then MessageBox.Show("You didn't check any boxes") Else 'code here End If
I understand that you love VB6, and that is great. So we can be assured here that I am not going to convince you that .NET is better, just the same you can't convince me that VB6 is better. That being said, lets be realistic here. I get that you are trying to find the "coolest looking" VB6 project to try to showcase to make your case, so you pick some 3D game type program written in "VB". What you really are showing is VB tapping into DirectX which is written in C/C++. I see some other shadercompiler.dll likely also written in C that looks to be a dependency on the project. I don't have the VB6 IDE so I am looking through the code files in notepad. So while this may be a nice thing to say "look what VB can do". All you are saying is "VB can use DirectX", and a pretty old version of DX at that. This doesn't really make a good case to continue using VB6 at all.
The truth is that VB. NOT has nothing to show. If you disagree, show me the code ! :) VB6 does not need lobbying since it has higher speed than C++ (I am referring to VB6 functions combined with machine code - available on PSC) As a last comment, take this native compiler made in VB6: https://sourceforge.net/projects/visual-basic/?sourcFurthere=directory but, if you say so ... :)
 Sub copy() For i = 2 To 370 If Sheet1.Range("C3").Value = Sheet2.Cells(i, 1).Value Then rowInd = i Exit For End If Next colInd = Int(Sheet1.Range("D7").Value + 1) Worksheets("Sheet2").Cells(rowInd, colInd).Value = Worksheets("Sheet2").Cells(rowInd, colInd).Value _ + Sheet1.Range("C8").Value ' Delete values in sheet 1 Sheet1.Range("C3").Value = "" Sheet1.Range("D7").Value = "" Sheet1.Range("C8").Value = "" End Sub I think i understand what you want. Sheet1 https://i.gyazo.com/015bfd230d9dd39b5fc1d8446c28d965.png Sheet2 https://i.gyazo.com/e8f7cad87c7e4756191f709f2dfede26.png Notes: I'm not sure if this is the correct format for the sheets, but it shouldn't be too hard to fix. Some basic error catching should probably be added. Make sure date is in correct format, and there are values in each cell, etc. You could make a userform which might look a bit more professional? Also, i'm pretty sure this whole thing is possible just using excel and vlookup/index(match) 
I think you have exactly the right idea. There are some issues though when running the macro: 1. I get a syntax error from the underscore on your longest line of code. 2. If I remove the underscore I still get Run-time error '9': Subscript out of range. EDIT: Nevermind, I had a mistake left there myself. Got it working now.
 If (CheckBox1.Checked And CheckBox2.Checked And CheckBox3.Checked) = False Then MsgBox("select value plz") End If
I'm quite interested though, how could you pull something like this off using vlookup or index(match)? (Despite this being a bit off-topic for this sub)
The subscript error resulted from me not noticing the quotes around "Sheet2", so I didn't change the sheet name to be correct.
C++ can also use "machine code"... how exactly is VB6 faster? Better, [C++ actually has support](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15971/Using-Inline-Assembly-in-C-C) so that you can put inline assembly (readable and understandable) in the source code. VB6 has to use a bad kludge with byte arrays that's unreadable and has to be created outside the code... It's not exactly VB6 anymore, is it? I don't understand why you VB6 power users don't just get together and write the new "Open Source VB6++" from scratch using the current VB6. You already have a native compiler, the rest can't be that hard... not when you have the power of VB6!
Oh that's a nice feature there! Thanks!
Right! Your first point was spot on. I actually was running it on a windows 7 and probably that's why I didn't realise that obvious fact. Thank you so much! :)
You do know that the current version of VB.NET's compiler was written itself in VB.NET right? You know that [ngen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf.aspx) can produce machine code compiled .NET assemblies right? How do you do the following in VB6? * Anonymous types * Inheritance * Generics * XAML UI * short circuiting operators * modern app and modern theme support * multi touch point interfaces * Iterators * multithreading * async programming models We could go simpler * Initalize a variable and assign it a value in the same line * Assign objects without using the Set keyword * continue a code line without an underscore * infer types with strongly typed objects * handle errors properly without goto statements I could go on and on.

Finally a guy who knows ! Yes, VB6 today is not the old VB6. That's because VB6 programmers made new controls for it. You will hear from many people something hard to understand, namely that VB6 it perfect as it is. What it needs is just the "Visual Basic 6.1" text written on the interface and a place to buy it. The new "Open Source VB6++" is not possible due to Microsoft. One can not call it "Visual Basic 6.0" or "6.1" and so on. And this is the hole point. You see ... VB6 is like Star Trek in many ways. PS: "how exactly is VB6 faster?" the VB6 applications run faster than those made in C++, if ASM is used (see the PSC codes). https://www.google.ro/search?q=vb6+%2B+asm&amp;oq=vb6+%2B+asm&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j0l4.5019j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8 http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19239/Compilers-Demystified-Function-Pointers-in-Visual 
ByVal means "by value", which means that the argument's _value_ is simply copied over. Any changes made to the argument's value is not carried out of the function or sub. ByRef, on the other hand, means "by reference", which means that any changes made to the argument's value are carried over. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds! Sub MySub(ByVal arg as Integer) arg = arg + 1 End Sub If I were to call MySub like this: Dim a as Integer = 1 MySub(a) At the end of the call, variable "a" will still be equals to one. However, if I declared MySub like this: Sub MySub(ByRef arg as Integer) arg = arg + 1 End Sub And do the same call, "a" will now be equals to 2. That's literally the only difference between ByVal and ByRef. When you get into passing objects as arguments, you'll usually want to call them ByRef for other assorted reasons, but that's another thing altogether.
When I see what my dad built in the past 40 years using GW/Quick/Visual Basic I wonder why it didn't get more awards. A language from a time where every dev had a background in an entirely different field.
You could create a list, or an array containing 0-9. Then get a random number from the list/array and remove it. Then get the next random number from the shortened list/array. 
So I create a list containing the numbers 0-9 or words on lines 0-9. and I don't get your next 2 lines??? 
randomizes any word between 0 to 9 What do you even mean by that? What words are between 0-9, how are these words stored. 
 Public Class Form1 Dim numbers As New List(Of Integer) Dim rnd As New Random Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Dim rndIndex As Integer = rnd.Next(0, (numbers.Count - 1)) Dim rndNumber As Integer = numbers(rndIndex) numbers.Remove(rndNumber) MsgBox(rndNumber) End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load For i As Integer = 0 To 9 numbers.Add(i) Next i End Sub End Class Something like that. I thought you wanted an explanation, not me do it for you. 
What you need is called a "shuffle"; you take your list of 0-9 and shuffle it, then use them one by one. If you want to "remove" the used ones as you go, you can use a Queue. Sub Main ' A list of 0..9 Dim lst = Enumerable.Range(0, 10).ToList ' Shuffle that list and put it in a queue Dim q = New Queue(Of Integer)(lst.OrderBy(Function(w) Guid.NewGuid())) ' Get next word Do While q.Any Console.WriteLine(q.Dequeue) Loop End Sub (Note: In Real Life^tm, do not use GUIDs to shuffle, look into the Fisher Yates algorithm...)
If you're attempting to randomize a specific amount of data, then just generate a random number that is a magnitude larger than the amount of data you are attempting to randomize. So since you're randomizing 10 items, generate a list of 10 random numbers between 0 and 99. Then sort both, the numbers you are randomizing and the generated list of randomized number. You've now just generated a randomized order for your data.
You actually have been the one with nothing to show. You have done nothing at all to showcase anything that VB6 can do other than to be propped up by software written in other languages. "Look at this super cool 3D FPS". Except none of the heavy lifting for that is done in VB at all. It is just all DX calls. Show me a 3D game engine with physics and shaders written in VB6. Don't just try to find the most complex thing and showcase that when it really has nothing to do with VB6 at all.
I see the program you are working on is Chapter 3 Programming Challenge #4 Theater Revenue from Starting Out with Visual Basic 2012. Dim valid As Boolean = True For Each ctrl In Me.GroupBox1.Controls.OfType(Of TextBox)() Dim text As String = ctrl.Text Dim num As Double If Not Double.TryParse(text, num) Or Not num &gt;= 0 Then ctrl.BackColor = Color.Red valid = False End If Next If valid Then ' Processing and output go here End If
it's not clear what you are stating your problem is. When the hotel is full are you trying to state the hotel is full before asking for a room? If so, you could check if the listbox.items.count = 6 and if it does, tell the user the hotel is full and exit out of the routine. This would be the first thing you would check in your button click event. This should also alleviate the need to loop through the array and check it later. If the point of the exercise is to loop through the array, then move that up to perform the counter increment prior to prompting the user for anything. Because if counter = 6 then don't even ask for any more info, just state that the hotel is full.
1. Create an array that contains all possible numbers in the range in sequence. 2. Randomize the array. 3. Step through the array from start to finish.
This should work if you have a form that displays the report. I would go with creating a form for the report.
Assuming VB.Net, you can use the "System.Random" object to create your random numbers. Here is a short example: Sub Main Dim rnd = New System.Random ' You only need 1 of those ' get our numbers For i = 1 To 3 ' In "rnd.Next" the lower bound is inclusive, ' and upper bound exclusive, ' so 1, 11 will generate between 1..10 Dim number = rnd.Next(1, 11) Console.WriteLine(number) Next End Sub 
You forgot to show me your code too. You have nothing to show ? Can you even code ? I said that VB6 is not what it was before. Thus, this is a BigInteger class (one of many) library for VB6 that supports an unlimited number of digits, including negative values (and yes, this class is faster than your VB. NET embedded function for this kind of stuff): http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=68710&amp;lngWId=1 
Ohhhh, just show me some DX calls in VB .NET that mach Visual Basic 6.0 ! I know that in VB.NET you feel handicapped and you must throw words instead of codes. PS:A simple google search brings in line 3 this old project, a pure Visual Basic 6.0 engine: http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=72016&amp;lngWId=1
Can you help me learn?
&gt; Oddly, it seems VB6 always needs something else to shine: DirectX, "inline assembly", some library or other from PSC, etc. Interesting that you say that, this means that our VB6 programmers have mastered the ASM language, which I can NOT say about the VB .NOT programmers. While we evolve the VB6 language without Microsoft, relying exclusively on our own knowledge and strengths, you all rely on what the new Microsoft makes you swallow in VB.NET, without knowing how it works. You failed to give me a VB.Net example that uses DirectX as VB6 does (because there is no such example). VB.NET is really so bad ? by the way, I just found this very old example, which is pure VB6: http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=72016&amp;lngWId=1 We, in the VB6 community, have respect for other people's work, I for one think it is important. In fact I am very proud that in the VB6 community the majority is made by brilliant people (which I can NOT say about VB. NET small community). The VB. NET community desperately but unsuccessfully is trying to copy our VB6 codes that appear on the Internet on a daily basis. Also, VB6 works well on the 64bit land (I bet you did not know that). I Also bet you did not know that Visual Basic 6.0 works on Linux! I am not advocating for VB6 (it does not need advocating anymore), I just try to wake you up to the reality: VB6.1 is the future. Regarding "Project Euler 13" ... you must be kidding ! You should be more aware of what surrounds you: http://vb6awards.blogspot.com/2016/02/visual-basic-wins-technical-impact.html
If you wanted to do ctrl+v, you would do SendKeys.Send("%V") Not in two separate calls.
the ctrl+V was just a test. I tried with other combinations and those don't work either If comboFirst.Text = "Ctrl" AndAlso comboSecond.Text = "V" Then SendKeys.Send("^V") SendKeys.Send("{ENTER}") End If
Is the target of these key presses the currently focused window?

so do I have to do that for every possible key combination?
I know I'm a bit late to the party but I saw your post and saved it, but I just thought of something I thought I could ask you. Is there any word if they will be expanding the ability to build Android/iOS apps in C# to include VB? Just curious because it seems like it wouldn't be *that* far of a stretch to add capabilities to VB, given how fundamentally similar the two languages are, at their core...
No code? Can't do it, huh? Too bad Google can't help you there... Thanks for the laughs.
Funny you should ask now. Hands down the best tool for developing in .NET for other platforms like Android and iOS is Xamarin, which MS [just announced](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/welcoming-the-xamarin-team-to-microsoft) it has acquired yesterday. While Xamarin never had as integrated support for VB like it did for C#, it did support VB for making PCLs (portable class libraries) which could be used in Xamarin. So as it stood there was no real way to use it with just VB (you had to use a mix of VB and C#), this could very well change now that it is being brought under the fold of the Microsoft developer division. Still too early to say for sure, but definitely looks promising that we could get better support there.
uh, you use a for loop over the list items? I don't understand what the difficulty is.
I'm not sure what you mean.
at that level maybe not, but then parsing out the result to make sense of it? yeah.
I've used Regex and web requests in jobs before. Would you say those skills are intermediate then?
 For Each s As String In ListBox1.Items **copy code goes here** Next Loops are pretty much that simple a lot of times.
Very much agree with this, but I tend to let it slide for those just learning. They soon enough come to realize themselves why VAL Is bad if they keep using it.
... I feel like an idiot sometimes. 
Believe me, there's so many things that I didn't know how to do that made so much sense when I saw an example.
I'm not sure what's not working with this, but if this is for a real application then you really should look into Epson's ADKs. Opos is is going to be more robust, and print far faster than dealing with the printer as a Windows Printer. https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=soft&amp;scat=38 
Thanks for the reply i'll have a look at that! I've made an adjustment i've removed the 'Itemstobeprinted' And inserted this: Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage e.Graphics.DrawString(TextBox1.Text, TextBox1.Font, Brushes.Black, 100, 100) End Sub It appears to do the trick for what i need. 
I noticed your Code is not really object oriented, so i wrote you what you want in a OO style, i hope you understand everything. If not feel free to ask. I created a Class Deck which consists of a List of Cards. The Cards will be filled dynamically into the deck and if you pull a card from the deck, it gets smaller. to try it out you need a Form1, a Listbox1 and a Button1, on Button Click the List gets populated with cards in a random order: Public Class Form1 Public CurrentDeck As New Deck Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click While CurrentDeck.CurrentDeckSize &gt; 0 Dim RandomCard As Card = CurrentDeck.GetRandomCard ListBox1.Items.Add(RandomCard.CardName &amp; " Worth:" &amp; RandomCard.Worth) End While End Sub End Class Public Class Card Public Enum CardType 'All Possible CardTypes Heart = 1 Diamond Spade Clover End Enum Public Enum CardValue 'All Possible CardValues Two = 2 Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Jack Queen King Ace End Enum Private myType As CardType = Nothing Private myValue As CardValue = Nothing Public IsVisible As Boolean = False Public ReadOnly Property CardName As String Get 'Take the enum names, put them together and return it as string like Spade Four Return myType.ToString &amp; " " &amp; myValue.ToString End Get End Property Public ReadOnly Property CardImage As Image Get 'Best would be to put the images in a useful naming into a folder like 'Diamond Ace -&gt; 2_14.jpg 'Heart Queen -&gt; 1_12.jpg Dim ImageName As String = Type &amp; "_" &amp; Value &amp; ".jpg" 'Return Image with the calculated name from the folder where they are Return Nothing 'I wont do that here, so just return nothing End Get End Property Public ReadOnly Property Type As CardType Get Return myType End Get End Property Public ReadOnly Property Value As CardValue Get Return myValue End Get End Property Public ReadOnly Property Worth As Integer Get Return GetCardWorth() End Get End Property Public Sub New(pType As CardType, pValue As CardValue) myType = pType myValue = pValue End Sub Private Function GetCardWorth() As Integer Return CInt(myValue) 'Take the Integer from the CardValueEnum, End Function End Class Public Class Deck Private myCards As New List(Of Card) 'Upper Card in Deck is myCards(0) Public Sub New() InitDeck() End Sub Public Sub ResetDeck() myCards = New List(Of Card) InitDeck() End Sub Public ReadOnly Property CurrentDeckSize As Integer Get Return myCards.Count End Get End Property Public Function GetRandomCard() As Card Dim ChoosenCard As Card = myCards(New Random(Guid.NewGuid.GetHashCode).Next(0, CurrentDeckSize)) myCards.Remove(ChoosenCard) Return ChoosenCard End Function Public Function GetUpperCard() As Card Dim ChoosenCard As Card = myCards(0) myCards.Remove(ChoosenCard) Return ChoosenCard End Function Private Sub InitDeck() Dim CardTypes As Array = System.[Enum].GetValues(GetType(Card.CardType)) Dim CardValues As Array = System.[Enum].GetValues(GetType(Card.CardValue)) For Each CurrentCardType As Card.CardType In CardTypes For Each CurrentCardValue As Card.CardValue In CardValues Dim Card As New Card(CurrentCardType, CurrentCardValue) myCards.Add(Card) Next Next End Sub End Class Edit: I just saw that my Cardworth is wrong! sorry i dont play Black Jack, so i am not really sure what the values should be. If you need help adapting the card worth calculation tell me how you need it 
The question is a little general, but personally i never have nodes without a hierarchy property. the hierarchy is determined by the number of parents. And then you can ask if draggedNode.Hierarchy &gt; targetNode.Hierarchy then 'Lower node to higher Node else 'Higher node to lower node end if
Yes, exactly! I did an If...ElseIf statement where I said if targetNode is Nothing then do this and ElseIf targetNode.ImageKey = dropNode.ImageKey do this. It feels much better doing it that way. Both my If and ElseIf do the same thing but for some reason I couldn't get them to work on one statement..like If targetNode Is Nothing Or targetNode.ImageKey = dropNode.ImageKey, it would give me a NullReferenceException error when I did that but if I split it into If...ElseIf, it works.
Do you declare and make the hierarchy property yourself? I can't find it under TreeNode properties. Also, the way mine works is..let's say there's two parents. 1st parent has 5 children, 2nd parent has 4 children. The user cannot take a node from the 2nd parents children and drop it on to the 1st parents children. It limits the user to only drag and drop within their level/children. So your solution wouldn't work, right? at least in my case.
The problem is you cant really tell how "expensive" a catch is because this also depends on the type of error beeing catched. Also just to be sure if you understood try and catch right. It is just "expensive" if the error happens. If you use try catch and no exeption beeing caught the "extra cost" is basically zero So in other words, in all situations where a user can do something you can always use try catch. Humans are so slow in doing something that you wont ever notice the try catch cost if they make errors. 
I posted my other reply before refreshing and seeing this. What you did is exactly the right way to handle this. For me, Try...Catch is for things that we haven't thought of, things that we don't expect to happen (but can't defend against), or the rare instance where there's no other option (trying to open a locked file is one of these). And in the first two cases, we log them and then add additional programming to prevent them from happening again. Another valid use of Try...Catch is when you add a Finally block. For instance when reading a file via a Binary Stream. If there's some issue with the file we want to ensure that we always close the stream. If possible we would wrap that IO in a Using statement but in some cases we can't so we use something like this: Try open file for read read in data Catch log exception Finally close file / dispose End Try The Finally block has no overhead, and will get hit every time the code executes (both for normal execution, or if an exception is raised).
Agree completely with using Try...Catch on top of defensive programming. We wrap all non trivial code with a Try...Catch. And send all captured errors to our logging system. There's no overhead for the Try...Catch being in the code, it's only when an exception occurs that the overhead is incurred. 
Right in this case the solution wont work. In this case you should do something like this Get selected Node Loop upwards through ParentNodes If ParentNode = targetNode then you are in the same branch Is this too short as an explanation? The same could be down the other way round (so selectedNode is a Parent of TargetNode) About the hierarchy property. What are we talking about here? the default treeview control from .Net in a Windows Forms project? I remember this and have to say this is one of the worst Controls i have ever seen from Microsoft. I used it once in a larger project and never since. So if possible i would recommend you using a different treecontrol from the internet. 
A simple solution might be to use each node's ".Tag" property to put your "id" or "number". You can then check the .Tag on the drop event and decide what to do...
Oh, I gotcha. Yeah the most common error I've seen from the project I'm working on is the NullReferenceException error. However, if I went along with the Try...Catch way at some point it was going to be expensive regardless of if we could tell the difference or not. But you're right, nowadays you or the user wouldn't notice too much or it wouldn't affect the program drastically. 
This is a little too complicated for me, but this actually makes sense! I'm going to genuinely try and see how to work this out. Except in a much simpler form hahaha. Now when you say additional programming, you add that once you log everything?
What do you mean by non trivial code? I was actually thinking this, but wasn't sure if it was a proper way to think but technically you could wrap a vast majority of your code in various Try...Catch statements for the sake of doing it, and when there is an error that you wouldn't be prepared for then you could use the logging thing you mentioned to see what the issue was and add new code to workaround that error in the future.
OP did you actually downvote him? Because if you have a question it is unclear. Post- and Precondition are not words with a single meaning as you may assume. 
This makes sense. I'm not too familiar with the various types of errors/how to fix them properly and all that. Before this project/program I'm working on at work the most I got was from college, that too it wasn't anything as large as this program. But in real world terms, this program isn't as large as others. But this thread was really helpful in terms of broadening my knowledge regarding this subject.
In the context of code, _preconditions_ refer to all the conditions that must be met for a block of code (routine, method, etc) to run reliably to completion. _Postconditions_ refer the the conditions that must be met for the state (of an object, generally, but could be program state) to be considered valid. So in the context of what you posted, some of the preconditions would be: The requested room number must exist, the room must be available... The postconditions would be: If the room existed and was available, it is now occupied, and has the guest's name and it's number hasn't changed. 
This didn't work. Not sure if getting/writing nodes to and from SQL Server is the issue but when I simply used MessageBox.Show(targetNode.tag) it didn't show me anything.
Lets make an example: Root1 Child1-1 Child1-2 Child1-3 Root2 Child2-1 Child2-2 Child2-3 So what should be possible, what shouldnt? 
That's pretty much how our system works. We make extensive use of templates in Visual Studio, and we have a central logging service that all of our libraries and applications use. So I have a generic Try...Catch template that I wrap pretty much every subroutine or function in our system. That template includes the code to call the logging system in the catch, and looks something like this: Try Catch ex as exception ErrorLog(AssemblyName, SubName, Ex, OtherInfo) End Try The templating system (MZTools) extracts the name of the assembly (library or exe), and sub or function name automatically, and I have a keyboard shortcut that adds the template. The logging system exists as a global object, and then sends the info as an XML package to our central logging system, to be added to a daily log file. Those files are uploaded it to our server each night (our clients are scattered all over the US and Canada so getting info from their servers is nearly impossible without sending it back to ourselves). By Non Trivial, I mean things that are very small, and unlikely to fail or error. For instance, the following code exists in a class to allow an external owner to "shut down" the instance of the class (this class is the base of a Windows Service, and a timer in the class will read these variables on the next loop and start it's shutdown): Public Sub StopService() ShuttingDown = True Restarting = False End Sub ShuttingDown and Restarting are just Boolean variables. There's pretty much nothing that can go wrong here, and no reason to wrap this type of sub. 
You can drag Child1-1, Child1-2, Child1-3 only under Root1. My code right now will never allow you to drag any children that are under Root1 and drop them under Root2. Nor will it ever allow you to take Root2 children and drop it under Root1. The children can only be moved around where they are already located. The part where I'm stuck at is, for those Child1-1, Child1-2, Child1-3 nodes I want to determine how they're dragging it. Lower to higher or higher to lower. BUT, all of the TreeNode properties available don't have anything like that. They have the Handle, ImageKey, SelectedImageKey and those properties. But they aren't exactly working in my benefit. I just need to be able to determine the way they're dragging it and then once I do, I have to write code to insert nodes a specific way depending on how they drag it. Does that make sense?
Wait.. do you mean with higher and lower positions in the same level? So more a reordering like: Root1 Child1-2 Child1-3 Child1-1 If so then you have to do the following. Let the user drag. If he drops the node check if the position where he drops it has a parent node the same like the node before he was touched. if it is the same, you can actually move the node. If not you dont change the tree. Edit: Oh and about the difference in the direction of moving. I think about it Edit2: Well could it be easier than you think? I just checked, the Treenode has an index property. this should give the position. remember where the node was, check where it is after dragging and compare those two values. 
Yes, the reordering is as you specified! I'm not sure how I could've missed the Index property. It's pretty much what I need. I think it's not working properly because these nodes come from a SQL server. I'm trying to use a message box to show me what the index of my drag and target nodes are and the numbers are definitely mixed up. Thank you so much though, Index is just what I need. Now I've just gotta make it work the way I need it to.
Hahaha, what a coincidence! Right now the application is a desktop Visual Basis application. My next project, once I finish this one is a bigger project and it's a web project all in ASP.NET. Hopefully no treeviews there! 
No worries, in Web technology there are a lot of controls available for everything. Also let me give you an advice when starting asp.net webpages. First make sure to really understand the so called page life cycle and how to handle this in code. this is the main important thing to save you a lot of headaches because errors happen which seem unexplainable.
Visual Studio is for me the best IDE i ever used and everything else just isnt the same. I always miss certain things if i have to use something different. And CSS is a good start. The improvement path on this is LESS/SASS or in general CSS pre processors. But this is not needed in the beginning. Almost always database handling is needed. so i would advice you to look in this direction somewhere in the beginning as well. ADO.Net is great, no worries there. And ASP.Net is as you think. it is a monster in the beginning but eventually the fog clears as you understand the different aspects. just keep learning and dont give up. Oh and yeah... javascript.. personally this is my enemy. such a crude language. it is powerful, but it also can drive me crazy. If you have the chance always use something like jquery. 
Thanks for the reply, how would i go about doing that?
When the user presses 'Print' i want the contents of the textbox to be removed from the file the code is reading from. For example i want the line from the text file to be removed after it's generated in the text box after the user presses print. Sorry if that makes no sense. 
no no you got that wrong. LESS/SASS is not important right now and is the next step with CSS. ADO.Net ist the part of the .NET Framework which you use when you use databases. Dont get scared by the name. for the beginner these are just objects in your code like all other objects in VB.net. And yes you can do that i will try to help if i can! Edit: oh and javascript is a language somewhat similar to c and is used mainly on the clientside. so you put together javascript code which is executed on the c lient side after the user has downloaded the page. jquery is a library which is programmed in javascript to help with handling javascript. imagine useful features the language itself is missing
Ahh, well I'll have to look more into it! I'm okay with CSS. Not super great, but if I spend some time on it I can make it do what I need it to visually. Ohh, I gotcha. So it's like using ADO.NET to speak to a database and back to ASP.NET? Kind of like connecting them two together. Hahaha, I've heard horror stories about C. I haven't had anything to do in C, at least not yet! But I gotcha. Nowadays there's a bunch of languages/sublanguages(?) that are derived from others. Just like what you said, JavaScript -&gt; jQuery
&gt;So I have a treeview with drag and drop functionality. However, if a user drags and drops a node onto empty/white space or onto that same node itself, then it errors out. The user HAS to drop it on a different node to make it work. I get a NullReferenceException error, is it okay to use Try...Catch for something like that? Wouldn't it be easier to just do a test to make sure the target is not nothing and, if so, return from the method early? I don't remember the specific EventArgs for the TreeView DragDrop event, but something like `If e.DropTarget Is Nothing Then Return` at the start of the sub. (One other thing you might want to do is to have the DragQueryFeedback event, I believe it's called, and change the cursor to the invalid target cursor (the feed circle with the diagonal line going across) when they are not dragging over a valid drop target.) This is what I normally do when I'm working with ListViews and have button or menus that perform actions on the selected item... the first line is a simple, one-line conditional to make verify that there is a valid target and, if not, returns early. It may just be personal preference, here, but I think it's easier and cleaner, this way (one line at the start vs. 3+ at varying places in the method). One other advantage, here, is that your Try/Catch won't be handling any *other*, **unexpected** `NullReferenceException`s that could occur in your code—not just the ones that occur from dragging and dropping to an invalid target... so you could end up having other exceptions happen that are being caught, without being aware of it, even when dropping to a valid target. This can end up being a *huge* headache when trying to debug why something isn't working the way it's supposed to. But, if you ***are*** using Try/Catch for things like this, you should make sure not just using `Catch ex As Exception` and you are catching the *specific* exception that you are expecting... so, in this case, you are using `Catch ex As NullReferenceException`, that way you won't be inadvertantly catching exceptions you aren't expecting can occur.
Thanks for the reply. I understand the last part, but I'm not quite sure about the first part. Will the new class be a part of the main form, or the main module? And how would I build a list of these which can be populated at runtime?
&gt;However you are allowing the user to add a new circle right now would get changed so that you create a new instance of the circleSettings class and add the info there. Could you clarify this bit please? Why would I need to create a new instance of circlesettings? Also, where do I put the line "Circles.add(c)"?
Creating a new instance is really the core of how classes work. You need a new instance to store the variables in. Each instance represents one circle on the form (this way you have something to actually search back through later). You'd add that wherever you currently add a new circle. I'm not sure what your current code looks like so I can't be sure, but somewhere in there you are allowing the user to add a new circle, having them fill in the location, color, size, etc, and then drawing that circle. Wherever that is, you'd create a new circleSettings class instance, and put all of those settings into that object (instead of drawing the circle immediately). 
You should use the counter when you equate Fahrenheit not CelciusStart. That variable never increases. The next command increases the counter. 
No other methods, as far as I know.
Huh - I moved the variable declaration to a separate module and it works perfectly now. Thank you so much!
Thanks bud. i'll give it a look
Np bud, if you have any questions, just hit me up.
Thank you so much, ill try this out when i get home later.
Okay thank you for your help! I am still a little confused. The thing is that the cost of toppings is based on what size is selected and then whether or not they check one of the topping check boxes so I can't (or rather don't know how to) set the toppings to a price. For instance, I know I can say that when the large is selected, add 15 dollars. I don't know how to say when a large is selected and either pepperoni, sausage, or mushroom is also selected, make it 17 dollars. I'm sorry if I make no sense.
Doesn't look like you ever set `genbtnpress = True ` anywhere in `btGen_Click `, so your conditional in `prtBtn_Click` is always False. (Side note: `btGen` and `prtBtn`? You should probably pick one naming convention for your controls and be consistent with them...)
Thank you so much it works! I was just thinking about disabling the prtbtn by default when the program runs. And writing it so when the user presses generate the prtbtn enables. Also i've changed the btnGen to Genbtn lol. 
&gt;Also i've changed the btnGen to Genbtn lol. lol, well, ***I*** would have gone the other direction, myself—`btnGen` and `btnPrint`—but that's just my preference (I just like to have all of the `btn*` controls listed together in the IntelliSense autocomplete list)... and, really, it isn't that big of a deal as long as you're consistent... otherwise—especially on a bigger project—you might find yourself trying to remember what you named the control you want to use: "Was it `btnCancel`...? or `CancelBtn`...? or `CancButton`...?" and it's just a pain in the ass. So just try to follow a consistent way of doing it and, in the end, you'll be glad you did. 😉
I have been setting the pizza price with constants. Should I do the same with the topping price? like this? Const tax As Decimal = 0.0825D Const small_price As Decimal = 6D Const medium_price As Decimal = 10D Const large_price As Decimal = 15D Const delivery_price As Decimal = 2D Const small_topping As Decimal = 1D Const medium_topping As Decimal = 1.5D Const large_topping As Decimal = 2D
Luckily this project isn't that big lol thanks for your help :) and I suppose it's helps to be consistent. I just need to now make sure that it's repeats that process after the user presses print, so they have to keep pressing generate first before they print. 
Try this: If Integer.TryParse(currentTextBox.Text, currentEarnings) Then currentficatax = currentEarnings * ficaTaxRate ficaTaxLabel.Text = currentficatax.ToString("C2") Else ' Error handling goes here EndIf
Your changes here are a good step: 'finds price based on pizza size choice If smallrb.Checked Then SubTotalDecimal = small_price ToppingDecimal = small_topping ElseIf mediumrb.Checked Then SubTotalDecimal = medium_price ToppingDecimal = medium_topping ElseIf largerb.Checked Then SubTotalDecimal = large_price ToppingDecimal = large_topping End If However I suggest considering if you should really call the "pizza price" your subtotal. I guess it depends on if your subtotal is just the cost of the pizza or if it is the cost of the pizza and the toppings together. My thoughts are that generally a subtotal for a pizza place would be the entire cost of the food, but I suppose different places might do it differently. That said, if you chose to have a pizza price set you might wish to do something like this (with appropriate declarations above of course): 'finds price based on pizza size choice If smallrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = small_price ToppingDecimal = small_topping ElseIf mediumrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = medium_price ToppingDecimal = medium_topping ElseIf largerb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = large_price ToppingDecimal = large_topping End If Now you know the price of one pizza and the price of one topping. Are you allowing people to order just one pizza at a time? If so then you don't need to do anything more with the pizza price. However you definitely have more than one topping allowed on a pizza. It seems that all toppings are the same price (for a given pizza size of course) so that helps. You just need to count the number of toppings a person has selected and then do a calculation to get the total cost for toppings, perhaps stored in a variable called ToppingTotalDecimal. Finally, you need to calculate your actual subtotal for the total cost of pizza and toppings.
This is only some excercise right? So not something important? Then i have two little things for you you may want to change: Dim clr As String clr = stringtobeprinted If clr = stringtobeprinted Then TextBox1.Text = " " End If I have no idea why anyone would do something like that so i guess this is a mixture from leftover code and / or copy and paste. And directly afterwards: PrintDocument1.Print() genbtnpress = False Catch ex As Exception MsgBox(ex.Message) End Try Keep in mind that every exception will prevent setting genbtnpress to false. Depending on the code design this could be wanted (in case of the user should re try) or not. Just wanted to let you know that this could be a potential future bug. Also in general i would never recommend handling the "has the user pressed a button" in this way. But this would only be relevant for serious code. Also, your naming in general is not really reader friendly up to misleading at some points like this one: currentChar = currentChar + chars If currentChar &lt; TextToPrint.Length Then e.HasMorePages = True Else e.HasMorePages = False currentChar = 0 End If Of course i know that in some small exercise project this is not a problem. But, if you want to become a programmer i would advice you to absolutly always use useful naming so it gets second nature. Oh and lastly, watch your datatypes, but i assume a copy paste bug as well: Dim LineLen As String = StringToPrint.Length

Also please... format you code! 4 Spaces in front of the code
Thank you so much for your help. I understand why making it "PizzaDecimal" over SubtotalDecimal makes sense. This is my code now. Option Strict On Public Class Form1 'Declare constants Const tax As Decimal = 0.0825D Const small_price As Decimal = 6D Const medium_price As Decimal = 10D Const large_price As Decimal = 15D Const delivery_price As Decimal = 2D Const small_topping As Decimal = 1D Const medium_topping As Decimal = 1.5D Const large_topping As Decimal = 2D Private Sub exitcmd_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles exitcmd.Click 'kills the program End End Sub Private Sub calculatecmd_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles calculatecmd.Click 'calculates total $ based on selections Dim SubTotalDecimal As Decimal Dim DeliveryDecimal As Decimal Dim TaxDecimal As Decimal Dim TotalDecimal As Decimal Dim ToppingDecimal As Decimal Dim PizzaDecimal As Decimal Dim Pepperoni As Integer 'finds prices based on pizza size/toppings choice If smallrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = small_price ToppingDecimal = small_topping ElseIf mediumrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = medium_price ToppingDecimal = medium_topping ElseIf largerb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = large_price ToppingDecimal = large_topping End If 'checks toppings selected If pepchkbox.Checked Then Pepperoni = 1 End If 'calculates subtotal SubTotalDecimal = PizzaDecimal + ToppingDecimal 'displays subtotal price subtotaltxtbox.Text = SubTotalDecimal.ToString("C") 'displays tax TaxDecimal = SubTotalDecimal * tax taxtxtbox.Text = CStr(SubTotalDecimal * CDbl(tax.ToString("C"))) 'adds delivery fee if applicable If deliveryrb.Checked Then DeliveryDecimal = delivery_price End If deliverypricetxtbox.Text = DeliveryDecimal.ToString("C") 'adds and displays final total TotalDecimal = SubTotalDecimal + TaxDecimal + DeliveryDecimal totaltxtbox.Text = TotalDecimal.ToString("C") 'displays an error if no customer name has been entered upon calculation If custnametxtbox.Text = "" Then MessageBox.Show("Please enter your name!", "No Customer Name Found", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Stop) With custnametxtbox .Focus() End With End If End Sub My goal was to do something with that Pepperoni integer but I'm not sure how I can incorporate it. Also, since I did this: If smallrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = small_price ToppingDecimal = small_topping ElseIf mediumrb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = medium_price ToppingDecimal = medium_topping ElseIf largerb.Checked Then PizzaDecimal = large_price ToppingDecimal = large_topping End If with the ToppingDecimal, it automatically puts the extra $1 in the subtotal for the topping..regardless of whether or not you selected a topping. How could I get it to only add $1 when the small.rb.checked &amp; either of the topping check boxes are checked? I only want it to add $6 when small.rb.checked....then add $1 if there is a checkbox.checked too.. and same goes for a medium.rb.checked.. add 1.50 for the topping. Thank you again for your help and time. I appreciate it!
Thanks for the quick reply. I though the code was going to look different, it didn't. Fixed it. It didn't work, as I said before (system.threading.thread.sleep(2000)). Any other tips?
Also, i personally dont use the val function. Its a little strange sometimes. And as i looked at your conditions i saw this Val(NEI3.Text) = Int(Val(NEI3.Text)) What is it supposed to mean or do? isnt it the same like Cint(NEI3.Text) = Cint(NEI3.Text)
Multi-thread it so that you don't put your GUI thread to sleep: ' Reusable Thread Builder Sub so you don't have redundant code Private Sub ErrorThread(Msg As String) Dim th As Thread th = New Thread(AddressOf invokeError) th.Start(Msg) End Sub ' Pause new Error thread for 2 seconds Private Sub invokeError(Msg As String) Thread.Sleep(2000) MsgBox(Msg, vbCritical, "Error") End Sub ' Use error generator anywhere [e.g., Button1_Click]: If Not IsNumeric(NEI3.Text) Then ErrorThread("Tens de inserir um número, compreendido entre 95 e 200") NEI3.Clear() NEI3.Focus() Exit Sub End If Dim valNEI As Double = Val(NEI3.Text) If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(NEI3.Text) Then If valNEI &lt; 95 And valNEI = CInt(valNEI) Then ErrorThread("Infelizmente não podes ingressar num curso com uma classificação inferior a 95 pontos nas provas de ingresso") NEI3.Clear() ElseIf valNEI &gt; 200 And valNEI = CInt(valNEI) Then NEI3.Text = 200 End If End If ETA: Imports System.Threading so you don't have to call the Namespace every time.
Two quick uestions to your on point solution. Would this work with writing the text to a label at a form too? I dont do WinForms anymore but i remember the controls wouldnt like it to be updated from a different thread. And the second Questions is, if the clean up happens automatically after the msgbox is clicked. Or is there some th.quite or something required? Oh and the bonus Question.. i could pass a delegate as parameter to the thread right? as a callback function for instance
I thought the comparison was a lil peculiar, too. Val(), however, returns a Double, whereas CInt() returns an integer, so if NEI3.Text = "3.14" then Val(NEI3.Text) &lt;&gt; CInt(NEI3.Text).
Oh with the clean up i meant the garbage collector. i was wondering if the memory of the thread is going to be released or if i would have to do the clean up my self. Also thank you really much for the code example... i guess i never came up with this.. i solved it a little more quirky the last time, like this: Public Sub RedrawMap() 'Check if we are in the correct thread If Not Dispatcher.Thread.Equals(System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread) Then Dispatcher.Invoke(New RedrawDelegate(AddressOf RedrawMap)) Exit Sub End If 'actual code of the sub
I belive Val() function is used when you want to return a number from a string, and that's the exact case. If not, correct me please.
That's not by problem. The problem is as soon as I type "1" it freezes, but I was going to write "120" (for example) and "120" would not make the program wait. Am I making myself clear? :P
I'm not an authority on the subject, however, I'm fairly certain that in .NET the garbage collection is fully automated and it is totally unnecessary to invoke it manually. To my understanding, the exception would be with objects being instantiated using the "Shared" access modifier. 
&gt; Val(), however, returns a Double Oh.. well i did not know that. As i said i rarley use it. 
Yes that is my understanding too. but it can only start to do this as soon as he knows its not needed anymore, hence there is no reference to the object. I naturally always use .quit or .dispose on objects to tell the GC that i am done with it and to call its internal terminate events and such. You didnt do this and i was wondering if you just forgot it because it was a quick example or if you left it out intentionally because you know its not needed. 
Try For i = lngRow To 1 Step -1 If xlSht.Cells(i, 73) = "" Then j = Trim(CStr(i)) &amp; ":" &amp; Trim(CStr(i)) Rows(j).Delete Shift:=xlUp End If Next Works for me
Thank you for your effort, but I get the same thing as with my original code. It runs through it completely and gives me the done message, but nothing has actually been deleted or changed at all in the document in the source folder (It should be deleting the first 3000 lines at least, and some underneath the section I want)
Hello Nathan, i am going to give this a shot 2) * Personally i like the language style syntax, i also have the feeling this has a subtile influence on the writer of the code. Beeing constantly reminded of natural language seems to help people to write easier understandable code. But this ist just a personal observation, no actual science here. * Some region specific thing i like is that it does not use the chars { and } a lot because they are a pain in the ass on german keyboards for example * Beeing able to code VB.Net in the Visual Studio IDE which is great 3) * in general i am happy with VB.Net, one specific thing i dislike is the way you give LINQ Queries their paramaters, C# is way cleaner and clearer with this: C# .ToDictionary(kvp =&gt; kvp.Key, kvp =&gt; kvp.Value) VB.Net .ToDictionary(Function(kvp) kvp.Key, Function(kvp) kvp.Value) 4-6) I dont really understand what you mean. Problems? In which regards? But yes i like problem solving and i would consider myself good at it. And mostly i solve all the problems around work and the software. 7-9) First you should stop focussing on VB too much. even if it is my go to language for nearly everything and i really really like it, its just a language. You should start to think about programming and problem solving with algorithms and things like that. the language is just a tool to accomplish your goal. software. But if you want to have named school skills i would go with the two obvious: Math and computer science. Math not because you need to calculate extremely complicated stuff (funny enough that is what most non it people believe) but because it trains your brain in thinking logically and dividing a large problem in a lot of small problems you can easily solve. And computer science because a good programmer should have a broad general knowlege in how all the things work together. It can happen that you have to write some network related stuff including DNS and DHCP and the next week something requires a httprequest with following XML parsing from you. It helps immensly if you instantly know how this stuff works. 
Edit: Oh and i forget why you should think about programming rather than the language. The goal is to prevent becoming a "Fachidiot". Sorry i only know the german word here which describes a person which is extremly good at one specific thing, but usually only at this one thing. Noone really needs a person which can only code in vb.net. You need to be able to transfer a concept quickly to another language if needed.
You already have the answer to your quandaries in the text you wrote. I don't mind helping you with your homework but you do need to think it through carefully or you won't learn how to program, and that would be a real shame considering how useful programming can be. With that in mind I have a couple of prompts that I hope will send you in the right direction: * I see that you are checking which pizza *size* the customer has chosen, but I don't see anything in your code about checking *which toppings* the customer has chosen. You might want to think about that... * If you currently only have one topping option you should think about what you will do if you have more than one topping available. Teachers love to add extras to existing projects for the next project. If you do already have more than one topping the customer can choose then you definitely need to find a way to get that information. You're almost there and I'm sure you can get the rest of the way! Cheers from Osaka.
I couldn't get this to work either using a programmatically created instance of Excel. This works though.

Both Visual Basic.NET and C# compile to the same byte code and use the same standard library and runtime, and are pretty much interchangeable for most purposes. You can also mix assemblies from both languages without any issues. For the longest time they had some feature differences (e.g. late binding in VB.NET and yield return in C#), but now there's nothing really that you can do in one language that you can't do in the other, with one major exception: C# supports `unsafe` code for pointer arithmetic, there is no alternative in VB. As for why people avoid VB.NET, I think it's mostly because of the bad reputation of Visual Basic and because the majority of programmers are more familiar and/or comfortable with the traditional C-style (and Java-like) syntax of C#. VB.NET was Microsoft's attempt to ease the transition to .NET for VB programmers, and has always been seen as sort of a second class citizen. It usually had worse tooling support and often lagged behind when .NET evolved (e.g. the Async CTP). VB.NET does still have some stuff that C# doesn't have (`WithEvents`, disabling `Option Strict`, `My`, `Val()`, `On Error ...`), most of it to keep VB6 code working, but I'd argue that using most of those is bad practice anyway. At this point, the question is *why* use VB.NET over C# for new projects? The only things I can think of is being familiar with it and not wanting to spend a week to get comfortable with C#, or being really in love with its syntax for some reason. C# has a much larger community and thus is easier to find support for and/or collaborate with other developers, both professionally and in open-source projects.
VB supports XML Literals as well. People tend write this off as not important, but if you work with lots of XML data, VB is better than any other language because of this. I agree most of those things you mention are VB holdovers, and while I curse anyone who doesn't put option strict on by default for their projects, the ability to say, turn option strict off in a single code module where you want to make late bound calls to something like Excel without having to add references to a specific excel PIA version is really nice to have. Also, while some tooling may have not been as good, the most important tooling, the background compiler in VB was always better than C#. I think they are pretty much on par now with the new compilers being built, but the IDE was always more responsive to syntax in VB due to this.
I never really had any use for XML literals because I was either just parsing it or using some sort of automated serialization, but I'm sure there are some areas where it's useful. I don't think the syntax for constructing dynamic XML is that much better than LINQ to XML, though. I guess it would be nice for unit tests, now that I think about it. Since 4.0 C# does have late binding via `dynamic` as well. The immediate compilation for VB.NET was pretty nice, although I seem to remember that Intellisense was kind of crappy in turn. I think the last time I regularly used VB.NET was VS2010, though.
Thank you very much for your insight. You have some really good stuff in there. Yeah, I'm pretty new to programming in general. This class is actually a Visual Basic class. I am very interested in learning java and C# languages also. I like how you said that just thinking about large problems logically and dividing them into smaller manageable parts would be helpful. One of my favorite subjects is Math, and we've been working on Series too actually, which is kind of cool, because I think that leads into building algorithms eventually. Again, thank you for your time sir. This is great material. What would you say your job title is in your company?
&gt;At this point, the question is *why* use VB.NET over C# for new projects? The only things I can think of is being familiar with it and not wanting to spend a week to get comfortable with C#, or being really in love with its syntax for some reason. I disagree with this reasoning. For starters, I think "a week" is a pretty big exaggeration. I spent a couple of years doing a lot of VBA stuff and finally decided to see what else I could do with VB.NET... and the reason I didn't go right into C# was because I found there was already ***a ton*** of shit to learn besides syntax, and if I wanted to be able to use any of it in my job, it would be easier to learn everything if I didn't have to relearn *everything* (like writing a basic If statement or Loop). I'm sure to somebody who's been using C# for years, "oh that's simple stuff"... well, yeah, but there's a reason most people start out learning to drive an automatic car before a manual: it's fewer things they need to learn about—no matter how "simple" it may be—so they can first tackle the more basic (and arguably more important) skills, first. So it made more sense to focus on learning all of the new and different parts of VB.NET—and hone more fundamental skills, like programming patterns and how to structure an application—first. As for the syntax: most people sing endless praise about Python for its "natural language"-like syntax and how close it is to pseudocode, and about how beginner-friendly that makes it... but I don't get why people shit on VB over the same things. Maybe the syntax would be a bit more tedious before they had such sophisticated AutoComplete/IntelliSense functionality in place to handle a lot of that stuff, but **with** it, I don't think there's really *that* fewer keystrokes required. Honestly, I *like* not having to do any mental-translation based on semicolons and curly brackets. Say what you will about it, but in VB.NET, I've ***never*** had to spend any time debugging an If statement or Loop only to find a misplaced semicolon or bracket to be the cause. &amp;nbsp; &gt;C# has a much larger community and thus is easier to find support for and/or collaborate with other developers, both professionally and in open-source projects. You're certainly right about the latter: there are far more professional and open-source projects in C# than VB. And *this* is really the only valid reason for saying it is better to know C# over VB.NET (if you had to choose). I disagree with the "easier to find support for" part, though, because essentially every C# question on StackOverflow works for VB.NET: if you're in a bind, then http://converter.telerik.com does pretty decent C#&lt;--&gt;VB.NET conversion... probably not great enough to do an entire project/solution, but more than enough for converting code snippets. But there are even better solutions out there: Tangible Software Solutions has a free version of their Instant VB program (limited to converting 2,000 lines at one time) and it works *extremely* well. I've converted entire projects and only had to fix a few pieces of code that didn't quite convert between the two because of differences in namespaces. So, sure, C# has a bigger community, but when it comes to support, I've had no real trouble finding an answer because all of the C# solutions apply, as well. &amp;nbsp; Through all of this, I've picked up enough that I can fumble way through C# code, if I need to. And, if I really put the time into it, I could probably switch to C# in a matter of months... but, at this point, I don't **need** C# for prospective jobs, all it would really do is set back and slow down all of the projects I'm working on, and I still feel like I have a lot of higher-level, transferable programming practices, techniques, and skills to build, refine, and learn... so I'm perfectly happy with VB.NET, at this point. 
Get a random number from 0 to list.count - 1. Use this number to pull list.item(number) and add it to a new empty list, then use list.removeat(number). Once the list.count = 0 then replace the first list with the list you generated. Quick and dirty.
.NET is so easy to write, and for me it was easy to learn. It makes sense just looking at it. Also I feel like I'm being spoiled when I write in .NET and I can forget about those silly semicolons. 
It's been years since I used VBA, but I don't believe that string.length would work in VBA. String.length is VB.NET where VBA probably has a LEN(string) function. 
What he said. Vba is vbscript 
How exactly do i do your steps from the pull.item onwards? I got the random number with relative ease. EDIT: by second step onwards I mean how do I pull the list.item? and adding it,etc. Thank you 
You're 100% correct.
Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code I think the 'B' says it all. Basic is a language invented for newcomers. It's kind of like having training wheels on your bike. Nothing wrong with it.
Need more info brah. What are you trying to do. What event are you trying to trigger? 
I'm trying to trigger a keyboard event. I just learned a bit more about VBA since I posted. I think I need to use the Form class to do this, as it's the only one with a KeyDown event. VBA for Word does not have a Form class associated with it. How can I import this class and its methods/events?
You "pull" the number by retrieving its value and, subsequently, deleting it from the list using list.remove. You add it to the new list using list.add. Google "VB.net list" for some quick and easy tutorials. 
History for the most part - vb6 gained a bad rep (well, I think in many respects, vb6 coders gave it a bad rep as there were heaps of Cowboys out there writing shit prior to 2001/tech wreck) Syntactically, they are pretty much identical - a couple of variations here and there -some good, some bad. I prefer the VB syntax personally, but i probably write about 50/50 VB/C#. One thing I have always liked about VB.Net - for years, the background compiler is visual studio always seemed way more stable. If you got vs to no errors in the errors list, it would run. But the c# often required a couple of attempts, or stopped halfway through or something. It seems to be fixed in the recent versions of VS (probably once it all went to roslyn). Also, and maybe there is a setting I haven't found for c#, but I really like the horizontal visual line that delineates methods/properties in the VS code editor for .vb files
You might want to look into registering hotkeys via WINAPIs.
vba itself doens't directly have native forms or dialog. what environment are you doing this in?
Haven't done any VBA in years, so I honestly don't know. You might get better answers for VBA over at: https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/
The only thing I changed was the path.
I'm not even sure counts as a subset of VB6. it's more like both were separately forked from QuickBasic and developed independently.
Interesting, so you have a separate Excel file saved as an xlsm with a module and you are running it from the IDE? Do you see the files open and close in the IDE? Try: If Trim(xlSht.Cells(i, 73)) = "" Then It may be the case that an 'empty' value actually has a space in it. You do have full RW access to the folder correct? Can you send me one of the files so I can see if I get the same results here with your file which you do or do they contain private/privileged data?
Yeah, that didn't work either. Thank you for your help.
Visio VBA has a Shape.text property that can be used to read the text. [See here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff766497.aspx).
I decided to start learning C# a couple of weeks ago and have pretty much gotten comfortable with it now. As /u/tweq stated below, if you know VB.Net learning the other is nothing more really than just getting used to the syntax. One thing I found that really helped with the {} was an extension called [Viasfora](http://viasfora.com/) which colorizes block braces making it easy to see which braces go together. This along with the snippets that generate formatted blocks have made it quite easy to pick up. My biggest hurdle to day is getting use to == instead of = handling both setting and checking for equality in vb.net that and I still find myself writing &lt;&gt; in place of !=
The rule for the project is that: No matter how many toppings are chosen, it will also be a set price based on the select pizza size. I know that this is a little odd but those are the instructions for the project. The nested if statements allowed it to finally work. [Here is a zip file](http://expirebox.com/download/1a20cae517a6e9eb6f61a53a62952b9c.html) that has the compiled project. and just so you are on the same page as me, these are the requirements for the project in full: For this program you will create a form that will allow a pizzeria to take orders for pizzas. You need to get the customers’ name. You also need to know if it is pickup or delivery. If it is delivery then you need to get the customers address and any special instructions. The text box for the delivery information will be disabled unless the delivery radio button is chosen. (2 point) If the name is not entered you need to display a message and set the focus on the name textbox. (6 points) The user can only pick one size of pizza and the size chosen will determine the cost of the toppings. (6 points) You can add additional toppings if you like. Cheese does not count as a topping for cost. It is there incase a customer does not want it we can deselect it. Other design features to include:  Include keyboard access keys for the command buttons. (6 points)  Flow chart. (10 points)  Include ToolTips for all buttons. (6 points)  Need to calculate the Subtotal which is the cost of the pizza plus all toppings. (30 points) o Cost of toppings is dependent on the size of the pizza. All toppings are the same price for that size. o Small pizza $6.00, topping $1.00 o Medium pizza $10.00, topping $1.50 o Large pizza $15.00, topping $2.00  Use my prices for pizza size and toppings (2 points)  Need to calculate the Tax which is the subtotal times 0.0825. (4 points)  Delivery is a flat fee of $2.00. (2 point)  Need to calculate the Total which is Subtotal + Tax + Delivery. (2 points)  All calculations will be done in the Calculate button. (2 points)  The New Order Button will o Clear all information. (2 points) o Reset radio buttons and check boxes to the default of small, cheese, pickup. (6 points) o Disable the delivery address textbox. 2 point) o Set the focus on the name textbox. (2 point)  Create a button that will print out the customers name and the total price. (10 points) I believe I was able to achieve all of these things. Cheers from New York! Edit: Formatting 
Well I think you might be over-thinking it. --- Function Decide(a As Integer, b As Integer, c As Integer) As Integer Return Math.Max(a, Math.Max(b, c)) End Function --- Now, instead of doing the "two values are equal" message in the *function*, you should be doing it in the main sub, otherwise you're kinda missing the point of functions: reusable code that you (usually but not always) give it some input and it returns something else. So the function shouldn't be doing this. You should compare a-b, a-c, and b-c *before* the function. (You should separate input validation from the actual function; in this case, the functions only purpose is to go tell you what the highest value of the numbers are... it doesn't matter to the function if two or three values are the same.) If all the values are different, *then* you set the textbox `.Text = Decide(a, b, c)` **Edit**: Also: why are you converting the inputs to Doubles and then writing the function to only accept Integers...? If they type in 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, the function is going to return "1" even though all the are different values. **Edit 2**: you also can't do `Case Is &gt; (a And b)`... `And ` is an actual operator. Look at the last example on [this MSDN page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sdbcfyzh.aspx), or try it yourself in the immediate window: type `? 5 And 10` and see what you get. 
Hey so I went with your code and ran it but I can only get integers in my output. How would I allow for x amount decimal places? 
Change all of the places that say `Integer ` to `Double ` (or `Decimal`). If you want to limit the number of decimal places, you're looking for the `Round([value], [number of decimal places])`. So like `.Text = Round(Decide(a, b, c), 2)` or whatever. (And don't forget to test to make sure the user enters only *numeric* values into the textbox or that they don't leave it blank...)
I would run the macro without the loop on a single file and don't close it on finishing to see if the rows are actually deleted. If they don't, open the file in Notepad++ and see if that column contains some data which isn't displayed in excel. If you have a significant number of these, I would either create a query against the files and wrote the results to disk or use the autofilter from inside of vba to cull the data you don't want. It would be MUCH faster. 
did you mean 0x6D? 0xHD is not valid HEX as F is the largest value. the code is the code, 109 is the decimal representation, - is the character representation. if you want to print the code you need to convert and format it to a string, for hex you'll want a "dec2hex" function, I don't think there's a standard one but there's several examples online.
you can get the user currently logged in with $Environ("username") I imagine clicking on the Visual Basic button would be the best place to start to figure out how to generate a button. If you want it on the ribbon, that is a whole nother problem that I am not familiar with.
Why not change the label to a listbox? Then you could just append the new item via listbox.items.add("class grade") you could also select the grades a possible remove them later.
Yes, you're so right, that's my mistake! I didn't realize 109 and 0X6D were the same! Thank you so much!
i forgot to thank you for this! really appreciate the help!
So is that a formula or is that all I need to put in the module window? I also don't see the VBA button you are talking about.
`Return` from the method.

A university. 7. Yes. 8. Mostly self-taught, but I did take the courses I am now teaching when I was a student.
I'm not a programmer by profession, but I create applications for myself, co-workers, and users to help ease their workflow. 1) Application Specialist 2) Absolutely nothing. 3) So far I have created 2 read-only front-ends for 3rd party databases that are either no longer supported or need a pivoted view of the data (say, focused on address rather than permit). [Here's an example](http://i.imgur.com/BFBCrrv.png). I have also created an application for a coworker that helps them manage restarting a particular service on a number of computers, as well as one that fixes some INI files on login. 4.1) VB.NET. It's the only VB I can stand. 4.2) That's a difficult question to answer, as it requires quite a bit of self-reflection to be honest about it. However, I will say one area I tend to lack in is building algorithms from scratch. 5) .NET 6) Local municipality. Anyone curious enough can figure out which one. 7) Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

Do you have column labels on your files? 
Dude, this is a question for Youtube, not here. This is like 101. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0endqa0hEYM
We figured it out! Your idea ended up working! We just needed to alter it slightly. Thanks soooo much!
It seems like a very typical early programming constraint. Also, if the eventual goal is to copy the entire list as one string to place somewhere else, a label or textbox are better than a listbox.
Thanks a ton for the reply! 
 lstData.AddRange(lstCacheData) This adds the contents of lstCacheData into lstData. You may also want to do lstData.Clear first to make sure that the list isn't accidentally polluted before adding.
I think you have the direction of the copy backwards. OP wants to duplicate the data of lstData into lstCacheData.
By default when you copy one list to another VB will copy the pointer to the data, not the data itself. This is why you are seeing changes to one list being reflected in the other list. &gt; I thought of using a for loop to just add each element from one list to the other, but that doesn't really seem very good solution for larger sized lists. You can use AddRange to do it instead, as described by /u/PostaElf. However rather than: lstData.AddRange(lstCacheData) it should be: lstCacheData.AddRange(lstData) if I am understanding your post. AddRange does the looping and copying for you but it is faster than doing it in a loop yourself because AddRange allocates the space required for the entire duplication *once* instead of allocating the space separately for each item in the list.
Oops! Me not read so good. 
You can use one of the "Convert.ToString" overloads to pass it the base you want... Convert.ToString(&lt;number&gt;, &lt;base&gt;) ' where base is one of 2, 8, 10, 16 In your example: Dim hexValue = Convert.ToString(109, 16) Console.Writeline(hexValue) ' prints "6d" 
A quick and dirty way of doing it is: lst = lst.OrderBy(Function(x) Guid.NewGuid()).ToList Or, if you already have a System.Random declared somewhere: Dim rnd As New System.Random ' declared globally somewhere '... lst = lst.OrderBy(Function(x) rnd.Next).ToList 
Visual Basic 
Awesome! Glad it worked out, even better that you learned a lot along the way! Good luck with future projects as well!
No worries :) if you need to know more detailed information send me a message and I'll get right back
Thank you, this is the code that worked. I was wondering if it would be possible to create another class that Inherits from List(of T) and write a GetCopy() there? I ask because I have some other Lists(of CustomClass) where the CustomClass has a lot of Property procedures, and that may save me some time / reduce possibility coding error.
Thank you for your reply, but using .AddRange(List) seemed to copy the pointer as well, the comment by /u/JakDrako worked.

Are you Steve Bunn or just Steve Bun??? I used to know a Steve Bunn who did VB...
You can use this to write to a text file: My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllText And this to read text from a text file: My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllText All opening/closing of the file is managed automatically. Very simple way to deal with text files. The easiest way to separate the data will be to read/write to different files for different text boxes. If it must go to one file then you can place separators between the data of each textbox when you write and then use those separators to split the data up when you read it back in. If each textbox is only one line (no CR or LF) then just using a CRLF to split the data is enough. In this case: Dim data_to_write As String = "" data_to_write = TextBox1.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox2.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox3.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox4.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox5.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox6.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox7.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox8.Text &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox9.Text Then write the data to a file. When you read it back in use Split to split the input by vbCrLf so you get an array of separate strings to put back into the textboxes. --- **Edit:** Worth noting that this is not a particularly safe way to do it as someone could paste text into one of your textboxes that contains a CRLF. You can manage this by replacing CRLF with just CR or just LF before you write the file, then doing another replace on each string in your array as you write it back to the textboxes. Something like this: Dim data_to_write As String = "" data_to_write = TextBox1.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox2.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox3.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox4.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox5.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox6.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox7.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox8.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; TextBox9.Text.Replace(vbCrLf, vbLf) Don't forget to reverse this process as you are writing data back to your textboxes.
Thank you. I got the speech class to work. Is there a way to tune it to your voice?
You could look into the [Object.MemberwiseClone](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.memberwiseclone.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1) method. If all your properties are value types (as in, not a reference to another class) it will perform a complete copy of the object. If some of your properties are references types, it'll copy the reference and the copy object will point to the same reference as the original. But since your original question mentions that the object are being read from a server (database?) they are probably no reference properties and .MemberwiseClone will work just fine.
Ok, how do I go about writing the list boxes to text files as they are updated? So every time an item is added or edited it gets written to a text file. Also how do I go about loading them back in?
Thank you for the help. You're brilliant. :D
Yeah, reading from a MySql database, mostly strings. 
Ah, that worked perfectly without needing to check if it was already open or anything. Thanks!
Thanks for the help but this could be an issue when I'm running it at school as they block the C drive and a lot of access to stuff like that.
Do you not have your own data drive or folder assigned when you log in? Or a USB stick if they don't give you a networked data drive. You must have a data drive somehow, otherwise where do you save your code in class? Just save the text files there. You can specify the file location when you read or write. 
I do, I use an external hard drive when making all VB projects. Somehow visual studio still messes up sometimes. I was just wondering if you needed access to the C drive or something.

This is not really doing what i wanted, this messages me for every change, i was hopeing that someone had an idea how to do it and maybe would help me to figure it out.
I know the basics of building WFA applications in visual basic, all i need the program to do is to beable to see if a number changes from 0 to 0&lt;. Heres a link to the page http://www.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=datatekniker ( sorry its in danish ) but on the left side it says Nordjylland [0], i just need to get a notification when it changes. ive looked at web scraping but i think it is too complicated for what i need
Ah, sorry. I haven't checked Reddit in a few days. yeah, It's definitely my issue. I found a blunt workaround. Thanks for all your effort.
It's a pretty straight forward error, but one that's probably hard to solve in your code: Basically the value in the "Imagez" object can't be converted to a bitmap. It's hard to say why, but I'd guess that the prior line of code creates an invalid Image, or fails to get an image from the camera. I'd probably look into the webcam.QueryFrame call and see what is returned on the successful calls vs. the error calls. Setting a breakpoint in code will allow you to step through those lines and see the difference. Does it continue to throw that error after that event, or do new images get created? How often is the timer running? If the timer is running too often, then you may not be getting a clean image from the camera if it's a prior instance of the event is still trying to read from the camera. 
This looks like memory leak to me. You assign imagez.ToBitmap to imgVideo.Image and dispose imagez, but the GC won't dispose since it is attached to imgVideo now. Add this above "imgVideo.Image = imagez.ToBitmap" and it should fix this error: If imgVideo.Image IsNot Nothing Then imgVideo.Image.dispose() Hope that helps!
That is too bad it didn't work. I had the exact error doing the exact thing you are doing (with a third party control, ABCPDF) and disposing before setting the image fixed it. Before I added that code it would give me an invalid parameter error after about 50 iterations. The stack trace showed the error coming from system.drawing. I used JustTrace memory profiler to track it down. Best of luck finding a solution.
Hey, it does work perfectly fine with http://johnnycrazy.github.io/SpotifyAPI-NET/ and a little VBS script :) dim spotifyhelper set spotifyhelper = WScript.CreateObject("SpotifyAPI.Local.SpotifyLocalAPI") spotifyhelper.Connect WScript.Sleep 1000 spotifyhelper.PlayURL("https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify_germany/playlist/0tM7OMXCpinEsx6ugSdfL6") 
2 nested for loops to iterate the lists? maybe you're overthinking it?
GDI+ is just fine for non-intensive purposes [buttons, static controls, etc.], but it can be a CPU hog if the graphics are large or constantly changing. In the latter scenario I would recommend using a better graphics framework [DirectX or OpenGL based] that will utilize your GPU instead of your CPU.
is sharpDX a viable alternative for VB? 
Depending upon the size and intensity of the animations and frequency of redraws, this may be fine, but I'd recommend keeping the draws in a separate thread.
I might go for SharpDX because I forsee 3D in the future.
Basically what's happening here is that you are trying to set the value of the drop down to "small", but that value doesn't actually exist. Take a look at the dropdown's code, and you'll see the values are actually all numbers. Since this is a school project, I don't know what code you can or cannot change. Your setAttribute function should work just fine, you just aren't passing the right value. The value for "small" is 123. You need to change your call to this: GetElementById("size").SetAttribute("value", "123") However, I would recommend changing the drop down values yourself if possible. If you can, change this: &lt;select id="size" name="size"&gt; &lt;option value="123"&gt;Small&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="104"&gt;Medium&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="938"&gt;Large&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; To this: &lt;select id="size" name="size"&gt; &lt;option value="small"&gt;Small&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="medium"&gt;Medium&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="large"&gt;Large&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; And your code should work as is.
How do I track the substituted word..l.
if all you have is the .exe then no. if you have the code then yes, it's mostly text files, any text editor will do. doesn't sound like that complex a system though, it's likely going to be easier to just reimplement from scratch.
&gt;if all you have is the .exe then no Seems to be a .NET application, so it should decompile relatively cleanly unless it's obfuscated. I can't be bothered to install it to find out, though.
Oh, I think I misread the OP. I thought he wanted to see how SimTools works to get an idea how to get his own stuff working.
Most likely the correct version of Flash isn't installed (or any version). Are you distributing and registering the flash component? 
I guess so... I'm exporting my application so when you want to run it first on a new computer you must click on a setup.exe first. Is that what you meant? If not, explain me please.
I guess so.. how do I check that?
That's the point, It worked in 3/5pcs. It is installing .NET4 Framework, SQL Server 3.5 and Windows Installer 3.1 (Whatever the last one means). Shouldn't it be installing some kind of flash? It doesn't have any tickbox I can check in the prerequesitis.
Probably not. Most of the simple installer wizards don't distribute third party components on their own, especially COM ones. You'll need to get the redistributeable version of Flash that you are using, and figure out how to install / register it (or if you are even allowed to install it), and add that capability to your installer via the Windows Installer script. Alternatively you can have it as a prerequisite that the user needs to install / update first. 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t0wsc67.aspx Read this article on variable scope in VB.NET.
mmmm , Im sure the developers of SimTools would not be very happy you want to hack our program. Actually Im fuming. If you approached us properly we could have helped you. And for free. It has been encrypted in compile, anyway. Shame 
No problem.
Oh no, no, no. Sorry if I wasn't clear; I'm not wanting to dissect SimTools, but another program that I'm in possession of that's very similar to SimTools! The program that came with these simulators! The xsim community is awesome - I've been getting great help on there - but am wondering if it would be best for me to develop my own program (or pay someone to do it) since this will wind up being used for a small commercial enterprise. EDIT: I just re-read my post and realize I wasn't clear about the "current" piece of software. I actually copied some of that text from [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/49lrt0/absolute_beginner_need_to_learn_motion_control/) I made in /r/programming where I mentioned more about the sim software I'm using now and have used in the past. 
Yeah, I didn't even know Button.PreformClick() was a thing. Ty.
Thanks for the hot tip. It did throw an exception once while I was testing the program and crashed.
Wait until you find out about [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/vb.net_savefile_dialog.htm) ;)
When building a filename from path parts, you should use [IO.Path.Combine()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.combine.aspx)
that's c#.
Front-end for an existing database. Servers Alive clone. Minesweeper or some other simple game. 
You honestly have to learn to at least read C# if you want to be any good with VB.NET. There's so much solid C# knowledge out there (and an amazing amount of really bad VB samples), that I don't bother searching for VB solutions when I'm trying to solve a problem. 
I kinda got it? 
Do something that's actually fun to use. Make yourself a mini-game using the little man from the wingdings font. Make him move around on the screen using the drawstring() function and the arrow keys. This was one of the first projects I made when I was learning many years ago, except I just used a circle. 
You don't say what is happening when you run your program. However, I notice three issues at first glance: 1. You aren't initializing your counter variable before you use it. Depending on if you wish to start at 0 or 1 you need to set the initial value when you declare the variable. Assuming the initial value is 0 then it should look like this: Dim i As Integer = 0 2. You are using variable length arrays but you aren't giving them a length (nor are you expanding them) before you add new data to them. This will immediately crash as you are trying to store data in array locations that don't exist. You can use x.Resize and y.Resize to give them size. 3. However, arrays are an old way of storing data like this. They are fine in fixed lengths but are very inefficient if you have to resize them. Every time you resize an array all the data is copied from the old array to the new array. If the array is large this will be slow. It could be slow enough that you miss data from your arudino. Instead you should be using two List(Of Double) variables, or creating a custom list that contains both X and Y. Adding items to a List is very quick. Finally, with the code snippet you have given, I don't see you using the x and y arrays at all as you are immediately plotting the new data to the graph. Do you need to maintain the list of data at all? If not you can get rid of the arrays/lists completely and just plot the data.
What i did some years ago was a sudoku game where you could enter the numbers from a real sudoku (gui training) and the program solves it (algorithmic training). Bonus is measuring the performance of your solving algorithm and then come up with ways to optimize it. 
That's more of a sysadmin job, I'd say. You can do what you are asking with the file-system. You can do more, and set specific workbook files to specific staff/departments. I'd expect it to take no longer than four hours: **providing**, that you have a clear set of requirements.
1. I suspect you want to use Mylink1.InnerText and not OuterHtml. That should give you the link's text rather than the text embedded in a bunch of HTML. 2. I also suggest checking for each word separately in your if statement so that you don't require an exact match of the phrase "visual basic help". Connect each check together with an AND. 3. ".Contains" is case sensitive which is probably not what you want. You can use InStr (not ideal) or use .IndexOf (best choice).

The webbrowser control has a refresh function. However you need to put a delay into your loop or you are going to be refreshing way too quickly. 5. Rather than web scraping this you should be using the Reddit API. It's designed for what you want to do and learning an API is always a good thing in my book. Easier on Reddit's resources, too.
Sounds like a job for SharePoint.
Just curious; why not use Word's in-built Visual Basic? (VBA) I don't know if .NET can do word objects like visual basic can, but in VB you could add a Microsoft Word reference to the project and manipulate it similarly to VBA (including calling search-and-replace)
Well, I'm not using VBA because 1) I had no idea Word had VB built in 2) I'm used to Visual Basic 10 3) I couldn't switch over to it anyways at this point But, I looked around and I couldn't find a Word reference for VB. Any ideas where that might be? PS, I'm pretty new to VB 
nvm I got it lol
in word there's a tool called mail merge which allows you to set fields and populate them with a set of data that can be imported from elsewhere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a41pgPA4Txc
What type of file are you trying to open, and how are you opening it? 
~~The SLN file through Windows Explorer. Am I supposed to open it with something else? I haven't tried opening it through VS 2015E yet...~~ Edit: Works fine now. Seems like it was being opened by VS 2010 (runtime was probably installed by SSMS 2014).
Can you explain?
You'll have to add them in manually. As a stop gap, you can also put in a 'global' try/catch by way of [My.Application.UnhandledException Event.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/710021/handle-net-exceptions-at-application-level) Basically, it's all-encompassing error trap. Note that it isn't a good idea to soley depend on this for all your error handling needs but it'll get you started until you can go back and add your try/catches.
Thank you for this tidbit. Basically I have to show it to my boss tomorrow and I'm still polishing the gui so time is limited. I can use the global and then after tomorrow go back and do it right. Thanks again. 
the global event is good for putting more friendly messages on generic errors, and also for replacing the default messagebox with something nicer. for instance I made a custom message box that has "continue" instead of "OK" after repeated "how do i continue, do I press ok?" support calls, and also has a "copy to clipboard" button to make it easier for users to send me the message. in the long run, error conditions do need to be handled specifically. such as on your import, some exceptions you'll want to add the record to a list to be manually fixed, but others you might want to just skip the record and move on.
Not that I can think of. Since the running program is an executable, it doesn't really have a concept of Visual Studio, or even the files that make up the project (when debugging in VS, the exe is compiled, launched, and then the debugger hooks to the running exe). You could scan the files in the solution folder on launch and use file dates to get the newest one, but even those will be wrong if you move them to a new pc, so they aren't full proof. 
Yea, I had a little time this morning to read up on error traps and I fully intend on going back after I show the program tomorrow to do the error traps right, or as close as I can get to right at least. I am just going to demo it tomorrow and make note of any changes/additions I am just looking for a solution to stop the complete crash.
You need to use a subversion control to properly do something like this. It acts as a database for your code and keeps track of changes because you "check in" your code to the database and it keeps a record of everything that is changed between checkins. This also allows multiple people to share source code and work on projects together. I personally use tortoiseSVN, which is free. However it only works at the Windows Explorer level. If you get VisualSVN, it integrates with Visual Studio, and works with TortoiseSVN (TortoiseSVN is required for VisualSVN to work).
 If string1 = string2 Then playBing() Else playBuzz() End If
[removed]
No idea if it is actually possible, but if i would have to do it i would look up if you can write a plugin for Visual Studio so it writes 'on compiling' a little textfile to the project folder. 
The game and the code aren't complete. Probably some things there that shouldn't be and I know it's messy. I'm completely new to VB and used crappy Turing before. Just learning from my highschool class. I usually do comment but I end up doing most of it later because I'm so interested in just getting the code done. Or the main part of it done. And the exception raised? Do you mean by the error that it shows? Because it doesn't show any the program just closes and goes back to visual studio so I have no idea what it is.
First, you'll need some sort of input other than the textbox. There are cool ways to do this like key presses and whatnot, but for a beginner, simply make a button. Now, when this button is clicked, you'll want it to get the text in the textbox and compare it to the correct word Use an if statement for this! If txtName.Text = "Correct Verb Here" Then playBing() Else playBuzz() End If As you previously asked, the "string1" and "string2" things are objects or variables. To make it easy, simply use the textbox and the correct answer I hope this helps! If you need anything else, just ask
Yeah, I guess you're right. Tried a blue one and it worked nicely. Just a question though, which is the better implementation for this (because I'm thinking of adding color change on hover as well), is it best to write the code down in the Designer code or execute it on load?
Hey, you're right! Thanks!
Generally design elements are set via the designer unless they *need* to be changed during runtime. 
There are two ways you can do this: 1. Check the password inside the case statement. That way the password check will only happen if the name is found. 2. Use a token. Declare a boolean variable ("UserExists") and set it to false. Make sure this happens at the top of your routine, before the case statement. Then if a user exists set the UserExists variable to true (because the user exists!). Then check if UserExists is true at the same place as you check the password. The second option is likely the better option for your scenario.
Can you just use another select case inside the original select case for the user Select Case password Case "Reddit" 'if the password is correct, let's ensure the user is valid Select Case user Case "ricky" ' ricky msg Case "sally" ' sally msg Case Else ' Invalid User msg Exit Sub 'so we don't process a successful pw End Select Case Else 'This is the else from the original select case 'Invalid Password message Exit sub 'so we don't go on to process the rest of this block of code End Select 'Now if anything fails, the following code won't be executed. It will only be executed upon success of user and password Groupbox1.Visible = true You can also shorten the inner select case by using a comma separated list for the case Example: Select Case user Case "ricky", "sally", "bill", "fred" MessageBox.Show("Hello " &amp; user) Case Else MessageBox.Show("Invalid User") End Select Much cleaner look in my opinion but not sure what your requirements are for the assignment.
take a screen shot and do image analysis? this is not a trivial topic.
Are you trying to automate faking your timesheet or something? If you subtract two `DateTime`s, you get a `TimeSpan` which has a `TotalDays` property, which you can use to loop for the desired amount of days. You can use the `Random` class to generate random numbers, and use that with`DateTime.AddDays/Hours/Minutes` to create a random time.
Define a Chest class with all pertinent information relating to said Chests (graphics, grid coords, contents, etc). Add a List(Of Chest) to your main class: Public Chests As New List(Of Chest) Create new instances of this Chest Object and add them to the list: Dim NewChest As Chest NewChest = New Chest(optional params) Chests.Add(NewChest) NewChest = New Chest(optional params) Chests.Add(NewChest) ' Repeat as desired OR create a form to build and add new chests 
I'll give this a shot, thanks :)
i dont think you understand what i want.. i want to make a program that can detect when ever a certen color shows on screen and i want it to click on the color, this is a pretty trival topic for me for personel reasons ( competition in school who can get the most Ruby's in hero clicker xD )
Well thats my bad, the problem is not to get the actual color, the problem is to make a program that automaticly clicks on the color. I have made an auto clicker and such but i dont know how to make it click on specific colors.
Well who cares im going to give them the program too ;) we are just studying together so we want to beable to study and not worry about thise random spawns sounds silly i know, you should mind what im going to use it for xD, well so far ive read something about "bitmap" that maybe could help.
&gt; So im pretty new to Visual Basic. I need help on some homework. So Basically I have to write a program that has a user login and then once they login it will display a groupbox that has a data input form. The User has to enter a username and password. I have 5 different usernames all with the same password that are valid. For example John, Sally, Bob, Mark, and Marry all with the same password of reddit to be valid. My Teacher wants me to use a select case statement to validate the names but I can use and if statement or case statement to validate the password. I have a case statement to validate the names and a if statement to validate the password but Im not sure how to get them to work together so the groupbox only displays if both are correct. Right now the select case just checks if the names are valid and says welcome or wrong user and the password validation is what makes the groupbox visible. So currently if the person enters the correct name and the incorrect password it wont show the groupbox however if they enter an incorrect name the correct password itll throw an error message but still show the groupbox. /u/iamtheguy22, there's a quick &amp; dirty option you can use as well, though it is not good programming technique. Inside your "Case Else" statement you can add an "Exit Sub" after you display the warning messagebox. Doing this will exit the subroutine without checking the password at all because no correct username was entered. The reason it is not considered to be good programming technique is that having exits at different places in your code can make debugging &amp; problem solving more difficult as your code becomes more complicated. BTW, it is not considered good form to ask a homework question, get help, and then delete your posts. In the very least you should upvote people who help you.
which is why you do the image analysis part...
There's a scripting language that's made for automating called AutoIt. You should use it over VB for botting and automating.
why are you using such a slow baud rate? use 115200 unless you have a good reason to go slower, like bluetooth or something. what's the sending side like? why do you have 2 DataReceived handlers? just do both things in one, I'm not sure you can guarantee which one runs first, and that's going to screw you up as one peeks in the buffer and the other removes from it.
vb 2015 is vb.net. every vb from 2002 on is .net (except VBA), and in 2005 they droped .net from the development environment name, but it's still vb.net. however, each version does have some syntax changes over the previous. [wikipedia's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET#Version_history) lists some of the more prominent changes.
You're doing a good thing getting started ahead of time. There are several versions of VB.net, as chrwei mentioned. Here is a link to help you get a start learning the syntax. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2x7h1hfk.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396
It will depend a bit on the source, and how you want to use them, but TryParse is generally a bit cleaner IMO as it's doing both the conversion and safety check at the same time. One caveat is that it will still overflow if you try to push in a value larger than the type that you are trying to convert. 
I found out about IsNumeric accepting 1e2, and since I can't afford to have any non-numeric character for that, I thought TryParse is a better choice. Overflow noted, then again the values I'm working are very much limited. Just to confirm, in this code: If Integer.TryParse(txtPXAge.Text, intPXAge) Then If intPXAge &lt; 1 Then blnNegated = True Else blnNumeric = True End If Is it okay if I used intPXAge as the output parameter for TryParse and used it right away for validation (checking for intPXAge &lt; 1)? Does TryParse save the value of the String parameter to the Int32 parameter? Edit: Read the KB for TryParse and it seems to be that way.
You could normalize 'odd' numbers like 1e2 by converting them to a number and back.
This might work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1269897/is-it-possible-to-change-the-setup-exe-and-setup-msi-icons-to-a-different-icon Outside of that, I'd move to a better installer system (Inno, NSIS, Wix, etc). 
for a for loop it says a Next has to follow, what do I write in the next section? Do I get rid of the while loop and replace that with the for loop and in the next put currentmoney = currentmoney+1? 
for loops are generally for x = 1 to y ... next x It doesn't look like you need to replace your while loop, you need a second loop. Your first loop increments the dollar value, while the second loop actually applies the money to the total, and increments the people count. Hope that makes sense.
That works fine for me. Do you have UAC turned off by chance? That may create issues. 
I do. D'oh! Of course that would create issues! BRB...gonna try messing with that.
That did it! I had UAC off and that was causing the issues! Nailed it man!
Your equation to calculate CurrentValue is wrong. Sadly i cant tell you the exact mistake but i see StartValue is 1 and you add more than 1 to it in the first loop, so after the first loop CurrentValue is always &gt; 2 and it stops. Edit: [This](https://metinmediamath.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/inflation-how-long-does-it-take-for-prices-to-double/) may be able to help you Edit: From the linked source some interesting trivia: &gt;One of the highest inflation rates ever measured occurred during the Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, a democratic ancestor of the Federal Republic of Germany. The monthly (!) inflation rate reached a fantastical value of r = 295 = 29500 %. To grasp this, it is certainly helpful to express it in form of the doubling time. &gt;n = ln(2) / ln(296) = ca. 0.12 months = ca. 4 days
I think there are two problems. I don't doubt that my math is wrong. However the other problem is that it is still giving the same answer for every instance of Rate. I have changed it to : For Rate = 1 To 20 Dim Ruleof72 As Integer = 72 / Rate Do While CurrentValue &lt; 2 CurrentValue += StartValue * (Rate / 100) ActualYears += 1 Loop Now the output shows the actual doubling time as always being 101. Even if my math was wrong (which it is), the answer should be different when Rate = 1 or Rate = 20. 
I have another question how do I stop duplicates in a listbox? Not removing after they've been added but stopping them from being added at all. Thanks
like, ever? add a static variable and exit if it's been set to some value that you set after the prompt or just if the list is already clear? add a condition to check the listcount
Not ever but I want to add a prompt that says user needs to add to the list before being able to clear it again u/chrwei. Atm message box appears again when the button is clicked even though the listbox is clear already. I guess the other option is to change the message box but again I don't know how to do that. Two message boxes under one button after specific events.
you add IFs and do the things on the conditions you want... this is what programming is.
I'm still learning. Sorry I don't understand immediately how to do it all without confusion . Thanks for the help 
No no dude. Cancel the while loop. you dont need it. Instead take the formula n = ln(2) / ln(f) and calculate it like you did with ruleof72 like this Dim Years As Double = Math.Log(2) / Math.Log(1.06) MsgBox(Math.Round(Years, 2)) 1.06 is your rate, in this case for 6% the result should be 11.9 Years
Thank you, I'll take a look at it soon, the frustration has set in for now haha
You can just add a boolean in 0 and when yes is pressed it changes to 1... When button is clicked it checks the boolean's status
Yup that's what I need, thank you! I'll try this
* Me.FanClub * If name = "".char * Then True * Else False * *I'm very new to this and I'm just trying to see what it would look like*
Me.FanClub(false)
This is correct. Me is a reference to the class or module that contains the running code, FanClub must be a member of said class or module, the stuff inside the () are your passed parameters. In effort to advance your knowledge here are some links that would be worth studying.

I think you need to review your logic there. you're only checking state if there's teapot, and then only if creamer, and then only is sugar, and so on back to if only there's 20+. I'm pretty sure that's not what you want, but you didn't say what you want exactly so....
instead of using a number for the Point, use a variable (for X or Y, it's unclear which you want) and increment it as needed, either by the label's height or width, depending hat you wanted. for multiselect, you just do a loop
You can also use a `FlowLayoutPanel` that will automatically arrange its contents.
Holy ElseIfs misnomer101 Man: Consolidate those things: ElseIf lstNumber.SelectedIndex &gt; 0 And lstNumber.SelectedIndex &lt; 20 dblOrder = dblOrder + (lstNumber.SelectedIndex +1) * dblPattern strSetting = Str(lstNumber.SelectedIndex) &amp; " place setting of " &amp; strPattern &amp; ControlChars.Newline
This is working great, but is there any way to limit the panel to only one column &amp; have AutoSize increase the length &amp; then create a scroll bar?
I'm curious if this would work. Though I can't, at the moment, fiddle with my project. What I'm trying to do is create labels that are selected from a different form's listbox. After a label is created, I would like for it to be able to generate another label below the first one, and so on. I know this would probably take a loop, possibly nested, but I just can't wrap my head around how to get this to work. As /u/tweq posted, a flowlayoutpanel is working well, but I'm again having issues with trying to get it just right. 
Thank's for the help! I fixed most of it. The strSetting is giving me an error in the label though. It is saying a value has not been assigned to it. On top of that im trying to add a tax if it is ordered from california. I used: If txtState.Text = "CA" or txtState.Text = "California" then dblOrder = dblOrder * 1.09 but if i type either of those into the text box the total is not changed. http://imgur.com/GDcwz6S
That's what I was thinking. What he's asking for is correct grammar of words (punctuation, spelling, etc). In order for this to work he would need to input a large amount on his own in order for this program to be worth while. He may be able to find some resources online, but in a sense, you're trying to build one part of Rosetta Stone... I suggest you take your time with this &amp; look for another program. Google should take you to some, even some online "quizes" and the such you could take. But building a program like this will take more time than it sounds. 
Use some google-fu to look up how to do Permutations. Otherwise: Console.WriteLine ("293 combinations!")
You are doing fine except: The first two DrawString()s are at position (0, 10) and (0, 70), respectively. That's the x and y coordinates of the text's upper left corner on the graphics object. (0, 0) would be the upper left corner of the graphics object. So, let's say Comic Sans 30pt (the font for "States") is height 30, your VerticalPrintLocationSingle should be initialized to 100 so it's just below "States". You can do that where you Dim the variable. Just add "= 100" to the end after "As Single".
