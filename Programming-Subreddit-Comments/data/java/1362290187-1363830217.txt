oh thank you sooo much i have been stuck on it for so long. I feel stupid now. :)
Come on, if you're trying to scam us into doing your homework, at least try a little harder. 
That's the Typesafe MO.
generally, anything that is this easy is obviously homework. very few people take the incentive to teach programming to themselves through reddit ;)
I think it's more like, you can use Java ME on Android now. The JAva you were coding for Android wasn't actually Java...it was Android inc./Google's re-implementation of "Java" to write Android applications. It just so happened-to-be that you could take the Java knowledge and write Android applications. But Android is not and never was, Java. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong; but I'm open to debate this topic ;P 
I'm supposed to be writing a cross-platform Android/iOS application. We were going to develop a native iOS and Android application, but since this surfaced, I'm going to give this a serious shot tomorrow. Granted I never tried to take anything from Oracle too seriously. But I have a crap ton of Java knowledge, and always wanted a reason to mess with JDeveloper, and I have it installed! So I'll report back...
Thank you! I truly appreciate it.
&gt; So I'll report back... Cool...
Please post a decompile as a Gist.
Does this mean I can use jars across the platforms?

The two classes run fine on my machine, with JRE 1.6.0_41 and JRE 1.7.0_15. I have examined the class files, they are a bit different, but they should work the same. Here are the notable differences: * `BugJava6Cmd.class` is a version 50.0 class file (Java 6), while `BugJava6Ecl.class` is a version 49.0 class file (Java 5). * `BugJava6Cmd.class` has a [StackMapTable](http://code.google.com/p/yasmit/wiki/StackMapTable) entry that `BugJava6Ecl.class` does not have (this speeds up class loading, and should not have any effect on code behavior). * `BugJava6Ecl.class` has a LocalVariableTable that `BugJava6Cmd.class` does not have (this helps debugging and reverse engineering, and should not have any effect on code behavior). * The byte code for the method `main ([Ljava/lang/String;)V` is a bit different in both classes, but it should behave the same: * `BugJava6Cmd.class` does its *b*-loop test at the beginning of the loop, while `BugJava6Ecl.class` does the test at the end of the loop * `BugJava6Ecl.class` is smarter about the StringBuffer: it calls its String constructor, while `BugJava6Cmd.class` calls its default constructor, and then calls append with the first String; so `BugJava6Ecl.class` does one less method call. Overall, there is nothing obviously wrong about the two files, and they both work fine on my machine. You might want to check your Eclipse settings, to understand why it produced a Java-5 compatible class. By the way, I suggest you also print `java.home` and `java.vendor` at the start of the class, to verify which JVM is really running your code; you might have some surprises under Eclipse. I have posted my notes at http://boa13.free.fr/tmp/jdk-bug/bug-class-comparison.7z (in Excel and LibreOffice formats). Yellow backgrounds are for cells that are different between the two classes. Grey backgrounds are for constant pool entries that are not used by the bytecode or by the class metadata (typically, these are further metadata and debugging data).
I have posted it as Excel / LibreOffice files. See this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/19gotw/looping_bug_in_jdk160_u31/c8owdkw
No
Would you mind adding the files here (https://gist.github.com/mikaelhg/5076137), with the class files named as jdkvendor_jdkversion_Classname.class, please?

Jdeveloper? Shivers.
On OSX I have always found FF to be an extreme memory hog. Try all the browsers (I still have them all installed because it just makes sense as a Dev)
If you consider a 2 MB library disk space (not memory) requirement huge, you must be developing on embedded devices?
``jarjar`` helps developers cut down library size.
The coder must have way too many time in his/her hands.
Not really so much that he "just happened" to find seeded randoms that generate this sequence. It would be trivial if he wrote another program to search for the correct seed that he wanted. If you scroll farther down in the answers, it took a guy only 7 seconds to find a seed to generate 4 words he wanted. Still cool though.
That's not an immutable collection, it's an unmodifiable view of a mutable collection.
Did you delete the unnecessary operating system libraries as well?
Seriously badass to figure this out!
Possible, or they just happened to notice a pattern. I am sure there is a way to pull the seed of a given sequence, or some form of documentation on seeded Java RNG.
Yeah, but Java is free? OpenJDK, right? ..something seems missing.
You realize that the class loader is lazy so the only cost of a 2meg library is disk space, right? If you really want just those 70k of classes then be my guest and bundle a new jar with just what you want. But remember that there is no way for a library designer to magically guess exactly what you need and only provide that. Everyone's needs are different so ever library that you include will have cruft that isn't useful to you. Hell, 2 megs isn't even all that big. The latest log4j jar is 4.5 megs. I strongly recommend that you stop wasting your time on trivialities like 2 megs of disk space.
Semantics aside, android runs java byte code. There's some things it doesn't support, like RMI, but it is basically java. 
Do we really get to criticize people for having "too much time on their hands" in reddit comments?
This was really interesting.
&gt; android runs java byte code Android runs Dalvik byte code which runs on the Dalvik VM. The Dalvik VM is nothing like the JVM. Java bytecode can be translated into Dalvik bytecode using dex to make an apk. You can't run an apk on any Java VM.
You can use things like [maven's shade plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/shade-mojo.html#minimizeJar) to strip out the classes of a dependency that you're not using...
The ascii code values for 'hello' are h=104,e=101,l=108,l=108, and o=111. The nextInt(int n) method gives you a random value between 0 (inclusive) and the value n (exclusive). With a random number generator seed, the random numbers produced will always give the same outcome, even in the same order when run several times with the same n value. Given that there are a bajillion seeds for random number generators, and the ascii difference would be x+3,x,x+7,x+7,x+10, they needed to find a seed that gave them those differences in that order when nextInt(int n) is run 5 times. Then he chose the ascii value needed to get the sequences to the correct values of the letters (That's what '`' is for.) Convert to characters, put them together in a string, do the same for 'world' and done. Also, it's not like they just lucked into it or spent years through trial and error manually plugging in seed values. Using loops it is pretty easy to write a code to get a seed for any word you like. I believe there is an example of that somewhere in the answers of that post.
 import java.util.Random; public class HelloWorldTest { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(randomString(930734) + " " + randomString(403622) + " " + randomString(17003514)); } public static String randomString(int i) { Random ran = new Random(i); StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); for (int n = 0; ; n++) { int k = ran.nextInt(27); if (k == 0) break; sb.append((char)('`' + k)); } return sb.toString(); } } 
Seems like you should be assuming that all of your input is a String. When the String is "Q" jump out of the loop. Otherwise, convert the String to an int value and do your opperation.
Eh, just write a program to automate finding the seed, would take less than 5 minutes. 
Can you show us what you've got so far?
&gt; I strongly recommend that you stop wasting your time on trivialities like 2 megs of disk space Unless you're developing desktop application where every second matters ;)
2 megs of unused code on disk won't impact performance at all. The class loader is lazy so it won't load anything that isn't needed into memory. So if 90% of the classes in that 2 meg jar aren't in use then it will ignore about 1.8 of that 2 megs. The only adverse effect of it is having to transfer it to them and store it. If your customers are pissed about your application being 2 megs bigger then you're living in 1998. That takes all of a second to transfer on many dsl or cable providers. In fact, what your customers are most likely to be irritated at is having to install a jvm. There are so few cases where 2 megs is a burden and they mostly happen to be in places that java is poorly suited for anyway. So if your fighting over every meg of space you should probably be asking yourself if java is the right solution.
you are! i edited it.
so confusing T_T
now that i fixed it can you answer questions a to g :) &lt;3
what do you mean you cant have 2 classes with the same arguments? what is the argument in those 2 classes
Doesn't cover Java.
https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingProGuardWithGuava Right there in their wiki. Works beautifully.
like it :)
If you don't understand or don't know what it is, just admit it.
What is this? It seems like a link to pirated jars of commercial games. Really?!
No, the point is that the user can say no if she doesn't expected a Java applet on that web page in the first place. I don't expect users to inspect the certificate, or even know what a CA is. Asking the user is more important than signing. But singing is useful to be able to determine that an applet is from the same author as before. So you should be able to say "Always trust applets from this source" if you don't want to be asked each time. Even if anyone can get a certificate, it is (I hope) hard to counterfeit someone else's certificate. You could even allow self-signed certificates here (as for Android apps). 
You can do it with regex: if(input.matches("^[0-9]{1,10}")){ System.out.println("Integer: "+Integer.parseInt(input)); } else if(input.matches("^q|Q$")){ System.out.println("Input is Q: "+input); } else System.out.println("Input was something else");
Not to mention Google will give you a few million results.
Still reading through currently, but a fun command for when you have specific cases is the [switch](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html) command, but reading though it as a bit of a novice myself, I'd say it looks like it'd work just fine. Seems a lot more formal than what I'd do, in terms of questions, etc. (I usually just remember what I'm inputting when, which is bad in the longterm, but, eh) Anyhow, nice work.
Jup, JNI it is. Also, you *really* don't need to do that, which means you probably want to do some trickery using Applets....
I really like Netbeans, because it has everything you need built-in.
For IDE, the 3 big ones are Eclipse, NetBeans, and Intelliej. Eclipse is the biggest, most well known. It is open source and came from IBM. Big, ugly, difficult to work with, but plugins for everything and most companies and projects have instructions for using a Java project with Eclipse. Some complain that it is big and bloated (but all Java IDEs tend to be) NetBeans is by Oracle (Sun). It is very good and also open source. Smaller market share, but still good. Intelliej is by JetBrains. It is not free (there is now a free community edition with limitations). It is fantastic. But it isn't cheap if need what is locked out in the free version. For compilers: First, JDK vs JRE. The JDK is the Java development toolkit. It include the JVM (java command) and the compiler (javac command). Plus some other dev tools and needs libraries for compiling. The JRE is the Java runtime environment. This has the JVM (java command) but no compiler and not all the libs needed for compiling. I usually stick with the Oracle JDK, but don't dismiss OpenJDK. I dont' know all the differences, but for most stuff, the OpenJDK should work. It is the official open source version. Start with Java 1.7 or Java 7 ( it is Java 1.7 but marketing wise is Java 7, it is a major version, same with 5 and 6). Each IDE lets you configure which installed JDK you are using or with Eclipse you can use the built in compiler (which is only usable for dev). 
Reading unformatted code is like asking someone to revise your essay, but the essay is in terrible handwriting. Indent every time you make a opening curly brace, dedent every time you make a closing brace. It might have been formatted when you wrote it, but make sure it's still formatted when you paste it to a service like pastebin. :)
Except for good keyboard shortcuts.. 
Syntax wise they are similar, if you haven't done much object oriented yet the main differences will be no unsigned integers, no pointers, no pass by reference, no freeing memory in Java ( [Comparison of Java and C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Java_and_C%2B%2B) ) You probably want to run through a few Java Tutorials - e.g. [Oracle ones](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) and get up speed - it should be easier going from C++ to Java than the other way round
Gonna add on to this comment, IntelliJ is apparently also really good. It's apparently a faster, cleaner version of eclipse. That said I still use eclipse even though my friends are pushing me to use IntelliJ...
thanks a lot , one thing though, when you said "no pass by reference" as in address or what exactly?
Intellij FTW
don't get the latest version of Eclipse though because it's slow as sh**, prefer Indigo
As in *all* method calls in Java are pass-by-value. `m(o,i)` (`Object o` and `int i`) makes a copy of the reference `o` (i.e. not a deep copy of the object) and then a copy of the integer `i` (yes, the Java Language Specification requires that method arguments be evaluated *in order*), sets them as method parameters for `m` and then executes `m`.
IntelliJ IDEA is a competitor to Eclipse, not a version of Eclipse. And yes, in my opinion it is much better than Eclipse.
One major difference is how Java creates its artifacts. You won't have a machine runnable file in Java. Instead files are run by the Java Virtual Machine. So your workflow looks a little like this - 1. Compile your java flies into class files. 2. Combine those class files into a compressed application file. 3. Launch that application by using the java runtime. A brief overview from Princeton http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/85application/jar/jar.html Because everything runs in the JVM, there are different tools for debugging and managing Java programs like JStack for generating stack dumps and jps for identifying running processes.
Still learning java here, but when i run this code from within Eclipse, I get the exception, but from the CLI it runs fine... As far as I can tell it is using the same JVM. This is on linux 64bit, jdk-6u41-linux-x64 java version "1.6.0_41" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_41-b02) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01, mixed mode) 
OpenJRE is significantly slower from my observations. I can't think of any reason other than idealogical ones, why you wouldn't use the OracleJRE. As for the JDK, you might want to use Open for educational reasons, if you want full source code visibility on how the framework is operating. Personally I would stick with Oracles implementations for most things, and certainly for commercial work. Backing up what others have said, IntelliJ rocks. Community Edition is good though I bought Ultimate after using for a short while, just for the support and additional plugins. Everything about it feels like an optimised and quality product.
You can't have two class constructor definitions with the same arguments. When it actually comes to creating the classes, each INSTANCE of the class can be as different as you can dream up. for example: new Foo("test"); new Foo("anotherString"); new Foo("yetAnotherString"); Three instances of the same class definition. When talking about the actual definition, people use the word "Class." When people talk about the actual objects created from that Class, people use the word "Instance." There are other synonyms as well, but those should take you far enough. Also, to note, I did not say you can't have 2 classes with the same argument, I said "constructor" - not "class." Don't worry - keep doing what you're doing and eventually all this will make sense. EDIT: I believe I used the word argument instead of parameter. Sorry about that.
Works fine on my computer, with JRE 6 &amp; 7.
&gt; the "LocalVariableTable" sounds the most incriminating It's not. Local variables do not have names, just numbers. If you were to debug that, the debugger would have no way to tell you what a local variable is. It's just a symbol table, not used by the JVM itself.
Hey, that's great! I'm glad someone else finally reproduced this bug. Thanks for letting me know. I can duplicate it at the CLI at work, using this JVM. This is Windows 7, 64-bit. At home, I see slightly different results -- I'm not sure 100% what's up, just that it apparently affects some JVMs but not others. java version "1.6.0_41" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_41-b02) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01, mixed mode) 
Oh, wow, I was looking through the tutorial again and again and I completely missed that. Thanks! I better go to sleep now.
lucky for some! I haven't tried it in a few months, maybe some of the performance issues have been sorted out. i hate the docking changes they made though
Hmm okay. I see. It's worth noting that [someone else duplicated this bug today](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/19gotw/looping_bug_in_jdk160_u31/c8pm4lk) on linux 64-bit, so whatever the bug is it's at least not specific to Windows... And I verified the bug at work today again from the CLI so it's not specific to Eclipse either... Still not sure why so many people can't duplicate it though, it's hard to tell what all of our environments have in common.
There are the official [java tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/tutorialLearningPaths.html) which might be a bit basic but also include most of the java runtime library. &gt; but for basics what major differences are there and what compiler/ide do you guys recommend? The differences are too many to count. Some of the basic ones Every function has to be in a class, that includes main. public class SomeClass { //main is public so it can be called from outside //static since it does not require an instance of SomeClass (same in c++) //String... is syntactic sugar for String[] - array of strings public static void main(String... args){ .... } } Namespaces are called packages and the compiler enforces both directory structure and encapsulation on them //The class in this file is in the folder test/code/folder package test.code.folder; //The class is public and can be referenced everywhere public class TestClass { //myfield is private and can only be used within this class (same c++) private int myfield; //myfield2 is protected and can be used within subclasses (same c++) protected int myfield2; //the default is visible by any class within the package (does not exist in c++?) int myfield3; } Java does not have *const* only final, which only overlaps on some features. //list is a pointer (called reference in java) to a std::vector like list //since it is final the reference cannot change, but the list can final ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); //equivalent c++ std::vector&lt;int&gt; *const list = new std::vector&lt;int&gt;; ...
Eclipse or Netbeans for ide. Have not done OOPs in C++ so can't really tell. [CS 61B](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/) is a good primer on a lot of Java OOPs concepts and stuff.
Lucky nothing, they spent a lot of time in this past Friday's Juno Service Release 2 working on those performance issues.

You can define any keyboard shortcuts. Not ideal, but available.

Are you OK with helping someone get a job they are not qualified for?
If getting a job is as easy as memorizing the answers I just gave, then the joke is on me for being so afraid of looking for a new job the last few years ;) I don't think it is that simple. Either he knows the answers or he doesn't and I think it would be clear in an interview. The guy asked for some information around interview questions and being in the same bucket right now I took the opportunity to put something out there that might help other people. I also hoped others might help clear up any of my misunderstandings. I am definitely ok with this.
What? Yes you can. Just add it to your Eclipse project and when you compile your APK someone will automagically package it in, where by "someone" I mean "some piece of software involved somewhere in the build/compile/etc. step".
You can't just arbitrarily use a JAR that runs in Java ME or Java SE. For any non-trivial application there will be dependencies on packages that don't exist in Android.
What sort of packages? Anything that isn't already there you can also import...as a jar. Haven't run into a jar that can't be imported yet; have you?

I KNOW YOUR NAME WHO ARE YOU OMG WTF BBQ
&gt;putting the "final" keyword on a parameter will not let you reassign to that parameter, but since that doesn't cause a side-effect anyway, IMO it's really pointless. The final can be used the make a variable accessible in an anonymous inner class. This is not possible: public static void foo(Object bar){ new Object(){ public String toString(){ return bar.toString(); } }; } But this is: public static void foo(final Object bar){ new Object(){ public String toString(){ return bar.toString(); } }; }
Anyone want to start a sweepstake until the next zero day exploit's made public?
Yeah, I forgot about that. Bit of an edge case though, and you could always just public static void foo(Object bar){ final Object bar2 = bar; new Object(){ public String toString(){ return bar2.toString(); } }; }
This is starting to be *almost* as bad as Adobe's acrobat updates. 
&gt; But it isn't cheap if need what is locked out in the free version. Academic edition is $99 IIRC. Though I do fine with the community edition for Java work.
That can't be a complete code sample - somewhere in the same class there needs to be a "count" method (that or you've got classes named in a non-standard way and count(e) is a constructor). If you're using a Google commons library though, then the [Multiset javadoc](http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Multiset.html#count\(java.lang.Object\)) should be your first port of call.
I must have been sent an incomplete version of the code because there's nothing there. I thought it might have been an old trick or something.
Obviously it's not literally a version of eclipse, that's an idiom..
thanks this was really very helpful!
wow, this was a really good read, thanks really helpful, i guess i really needed some code to help me understand better :)
Who are you calling an idiom, asshole?
And you can choose to use Eclipse shortucts in Nb. Sadly, there's no such settings in Eclipse. Whats more, Eclipse custom shortcuts are bound to single workspace, who thought it was good idea? 
I'll put in 15$ that the exploit will not be found between tommorrow and the next update, assuming there isn't an update tommorrow
Fair enough.
You should use eclipse when you are learning and your time isn't that valuable. That way when you switch to intellij you will appreciate it that much more.
this class may extend/implement a different class that does have the count method
Is this something you can compile? If so in Eclipse you could ctrl+click on the method in question and it'll take you to the method declaration, even if it's tucked away in a super class.
Your array is empty. You need two sets of loops, one to insert numbers and the second to print them out. On a side note, you don't really need arrays at all (but then that would kinda miss the point of th chapter). 
I sort of figured it out! I made an int representing table size, which is 12. While looping through both arrays I multiplied the two together like so... table[i][j] = (i+1) * (j+1); Now I'm just figuring out how to print it all on screen in an organized rectangular fashion. I assume I just do the opposite from the beginning. although I'm supposed to have a column on the left saying Row 1 Row 2 etc, and then a heading on top. 
This is how you set a value of a 2D array: numbers[i][j] = value; for your purposes, it could very well be numbers[i][j] = i * j; To display it, make another set of nested for-loops. Just do what you did but leave out the new line until the end of the matrix. System.out.print(numbers[i][j]);
Yup, very similar to what you did in your original question. 
But you can't tab to finish a statement and jump out of it. Instead, you must click or tap the arrow keys several times. And smarter tabbing generated statements to edit. That was seriously the only issue I had and if netbeans did it I'd go back. 
Eclipse is used in industry and is, in my opinion, the best Java IDE out there. It is the IDE that the profs here at Cornell recommend to us when we take Java courses, and for good reason.
Well, you've got a for-each loop iterating a collection returned by other.elementSet(). You're adding something to a TreeMap on each iteration, and that something is dependent on a count() method. other is probably an object of that class that this code is part of. I'm assuming that count(e) is actually this.count(e). It also looks like e is the key from other.elementSet(), so you're creating a key-value pair in the treemap, and each iteration puts a new key of e with a value of this.count(e) + other.count(e). TL:DR So, it's probably a method that counts the occurrences of the key (e) in this object and another (other) object.
What do we tell Adobe Updater?
This looks like it's part of a larger class. The class contains a TreeMap that maps a generic object E to an Integer. The addAll method takes a MultiSet as a parameter. The "MultiSet" also has "E" as a raw type. Then for each "E" in the set, it will map the element to whatever "count(e) + other.count(e)" evaluates to. --------- Other than that, I can't tell you much about what the code does. I don't know how new you are, and if that code doesn't make any sense to you, then you have a lot to learn. Here are some resources: Generics: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/ Object orientated programming: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html Maps: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html Sets: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/set.html
Is there any write-up or source code that explains these vulnerabilities in more detail?
Good read. It's bewildering and a little depressing, honestly.
Not today.
You can't tab, but isn't control+space accomplishing exactly what you are talking about? Even when using it with methods that require parameters, Netbeans will write down the structure for you and you are able to cycle between the parameters using tab or shift+tab.
&gt; And so, again for first time in my long career, I had to nullify java reference. For some reason this line made me laugh. It was fun to read of someone else's pain tracking down memory leaks. Not mt favorite past-time by far.

It's not the right subreddit and clearly you're too stupid to program anything.
Eclipse is shite. IntelliJ all the way.
I'm not sure why I'd be down-voted for saying OpenJRE is slower either. I'm not saying that I don't respect it for what it is: I'm just stating a completely undeniable fact; the OracleJRE *is* much faster. I really like Open-Source ideals and projects, unfortunately the voice of the scene seems to be dominated by hot-heads who, in their foam-flecked zeal, often stop it from having the noble reputation it deserves.
Thanks for those links. :) Unfortunately, they explain the general mechanism behind the whole attack, but do not detail how the malicious Jar file works.

Spring security
The Java standard for the login part is called [Form based authentication](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bncbx.html#bncby) and configure security roles in [web.xml](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bncav.html#bncay). User management is then up to your application server. You could have an administrator do registration and password changes using the application server user interface. Otherwise, you would have to write custom code which works with the user management of the application server. What custom code you write depends on the application server. For example, if you used Tomcat and the JDBCRealm for managing users and roles, your user interface would have to interact with the [user database](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-3.3-doc/JDBCRealm-howto.html)
Your knowledge of spelling and basic [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) seem lacking, which casts doubt as to the importance of your opinion.

Here's a [link to the BalusC blog about using Shiro for a EE (specifically JSF2) application](http://balusc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/apache-shiro-is-it-ready-for-java-ee-6.html), which - like all of his stuff - is a good read.
They're two completely different entities: console.log is used to record something in the debugger console; return sends whatever follows it back to the calling function. As scoobydarlingcoder says, /r/javascript is the place to ask if you want anything more than that.

Half-way in I start reading this internally in an (Estonian-?) Russian accent, and then it becomes very intriguing. 
I know it's pretty common practice amongst some groups, but why do people still reload apps in this day and age? Is it really so hard to just restart the container? 
No. You either: * Setup a realm that contains a datastore that you can programmatically edit (like a JDBCRealm). * Use a 3rd party piece of software. Redirect to a different app when they click the register button. You see this in the identity management software space. * See if your app server has vendor specific methods to do this. I just did this with WebLogic Server 12c. With WebLogic you can use JMX MBeans to handle these types of operations. Authenticating is better now with the programmatic login capability of Servlet 3/Java EE 6.
OP will surely deliver
No problem! Edit - I found the problem, on line 10 you use s.nextLine() which would have messed up your results.
Spring is always the answer, even before you know the question. 
this... plus use a password-encoder &amp; salt-source combination that implements BCRYPT, SCRYPT, or PBKDF2
It's called Google - use it. Seriously, people, a simple search will yield you the answer you need. This isn't college, this is reddit. I know some people are willing to help, but I'm tired of seeing it. 
If you have a production environment with dozens of web apps running on it, you can't just 'unplug it, then plug it back in' any time you want to update one of them. The same thing goes for our dev and QA environments; they are shared between multiple teams, so we redeploy our team's software because we don't have the luxury of being able to restart the server whenever we feel like.
What do you use to find the memory leaks?
I searched Google, didn't get the answer I needed explained clearly so I asked here. Reddit isn't YOUR website. Shut up.
Will give this a shot, thanks!
Thank you! Trying to put in a String when it's looking for an int threw it.
That's probably a good approximation, everything else will be insignificant compared to the arrays. Although I am curious as to why you would need to store so many floats like that. Depending on the kinds of numbers you are storing, you could also do some of your own compression (at the minimum a redundancy check). 
Eclipse. Look in the plugins directory for the JARs with "source" in the name.
I need to store 5 computed values (solar position + radiation data) per minute, and then populate an entire year's simulation with these 1440-minute days for later perusion. 
You're getting the input from the user via a `Scanner`, I assume? If so, you can easily check the scanner to see what's next: Scanner s = // ... if (s.hasNextInt()) { int anInt = s.nextInt(); } else { String aString = s.next(); }
Don't let baldbobbo discourage you to post questions here. I had a simple question earlier doing homework on inputting a char, Google search just seemed to confuse me even more for a while. Subreddits for programming are seriously a goldmine for simple questions that people can ask and answer. It's a big reason of why they are here. /r/learnprogramming has been an awesome help for me. 
Which spring security has! (bcrypt atleast)
I'm in the process of learning Spring Batch and Spring MVC. For now on, I'm going to assume there's an answer in Spring before I start coding.
Whoa, [Bucky Roberts a.k.a. thenewboston](http://thenewboston.org/tutorials.php) is an amazing source of knowledge.
implement it as an array of size 5 each with a pointer to an array of size 1440. Since the head of each array also take up space in memory you want less array pointers. So by doing it this way you have only 6 pointers to arrays where as making an array of size 1440 with each spot holding an array of size 5 you would need 1441 pointers. Also depending on the size of the numbers you might be able to save space by combining the numbers into a single number or string and before using the number you do a little bit of processing. for example the 5 numbers 1 2 3 4 5 could be one number 12345 or string 1.2.3.4.5. It would take slightly longer for your program to run, but if done efficiently the memory you save might be worth the little extra time
DON'T USE 2 nested loops. You can do all the work in one loop. Before the line System.out.println(numbers[i][j]); put the line numbers[i][j] = (i - 1) * (j - 1); The - 1 is because the 1s are located in the 2nd row/column and the 2s in the 3rd row - column etc. So numbers[2][2] should contain 1 * 1. Then after assigning the array value you can print it in the same loop. When the inner loop finishes print a line to make the rectangular shape. Don't forget to add the headers into the rows and columns. Also the upper right half of the rectangle will look the same as the lower left half. This is because x * y = y * x. So use this to cut out almost half of the array calculations. It is half because values of x * x will only appear once in the array so you only had to calculate them once anyways.
Run a dozen containers. Java app servers reinvented the unix process, badly.
If you tell the JVM to allocate this big an array, it'll generally try to do just that. Now, depending on your usage scenario, you could choose not to hold every value in memory, or store your data compressed, and then uncompress it one value at a time, as you need it.
Without giving it a try, I don't think so - in line 9 he reads an int, then in line 10 he skips the newline and goes to the beginning of the next text ~~file~~ line. The problem is that reading anything (e.g. nextInt) directly after a nextLine means that reading that anything is attempted from the next line. Hence the name "nextLine". Edit: typo corrected.
In the apache commons you'll have some rather small stuff (e.g. logging), but I'm not sure about the quality of the code (I just use them, and don't contribute). Try to find books which has something like "clean code" either in their title or synopsis. Or, oddly as it sounds, a book from Kernighan and Plaugher dating back to the seventies (Software Tools), or another from Kernighan and Pike (The Practice of Programming) published in 1999 might really help a lot.
You definitely need to read up on game loops. It will put you in good stead for the rest of your career. [Here](http://www.java-gaming.org/index.php/topic,24220.0) is a pretty good article on it.
&gt;from looking at the kickoff app, it seems to be a programmatic way to do what the web.xml security descriptors and j_security_check do declaratively It installs an auth module programmatically. This is a bit tricky to see, since they hide it in some Servlet startup listener inside a jar. "Normally" you would install such module via a server specific deployment descriptor in the war, or you would configure it inside the server. The programmatic way is not purely programmatic as-in do everything yourself with Filters. It calls through to `HtppServletRequest#authenticate` which triggers whatever "official" login module is present. Do note that it does uses the declarative web.xml security descriptors. j_security_check is just one of the 4 natively available mechanisms (it's called FORM, and BASIC, DIGEST and CERT are the 3 others) in Servlet. The 5th "native" mechanism in Java EE is JASPIC, and that is what this kickoff app is using. &gt;Is there a standard API or SPI for doing things like adding users and changing the password? Yes, there is. That's pretty much the main point of JASPIC. Contrary to a JAAS login module, or most proprietary ones, a JASPIC auth module for the Servlet profile also has direct access to the request and response. One of the authors posted a blog article about this: http://arjan-tijms.blogspot.com/2012/11/implementing-container-authentication.html
&gt;No. You either: It's perhaps a bit vague what's meant with "adding users and changing the password", but there IS a standard API to make the username and a set of roles known to Java EE (effectively login). It happens via the standard types [CallerPrincipalCallback](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/security/auth/message/callback/CallerPrincipalCallback.html) and [GroupPrincipalCallback](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/security/auth/message/callback/GroupPrincipalCallback.html). As their respective docs say, you call this code from a (JASPIC) server auth module. You can do this with code which has full control to whatever location you use to store your users. IF this location is represented by a JPA entity, then with a bit of a stretch you could indeed say that there is a standard API available to "add users and changing the password" (it's the JPA entity manager). &gt;Authenticating is better now with the programmatic login capability of Servlet 3/Java EE 6. What many have missed (and Oracle has done a piss poor job in explaining this), is that together with the new programmatic login of Servlet 3/Java EE 6, they ALSO added a standard API for registering _and_ coding the module that will be invoked after you do this programmatic login. E.g. what happens after you call [HttpServletRequest#authenticate](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#authenticate%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse%29) 
This is not a French translation, but a translation *from* French.
Is there still a valid reason to use EAP? I've seen it used in my former company and it was a disaster - mainly because the level of the coders was awful - but also because the hardest you tried to fit the application &amp; the server into a CI system, the hardest it became to build. The maven dependencies were ridiculously difficult to find, the connectors for arquillian did not exist / did not work, and my hierarchy would not let us try to run the tests on JBoss AS. 
My bad! Wish reddit allowed to edit titles.
&gt;Is there still a valid reason to use EAP? Unfortunately there is. The latest community edition of JBoss AS (7.1.1) is a bit buggy and hasn't been updated in nearly a year (this very week it will be exactly a year). Meanwhile, tons of bug fixes went into 7.1.2, 7.1.3 and the upcoming 7.1.4, which JBoss doesn't release as AS anymore. They fix some more stuff, and then rebrand them as JBoss EAP 6.0, 6.0.1 and 6.0.2 respectively. &gt;The maven dependencies were ridiculously difficult to find THIS at least has changed. There is an archived maven repo right where you download JBoss EAP, and it's hosted online (both as a single zip and browsable online). But for some reason JBoss (Redhat) does deem it necessary to scare you and tell that at least the online publicly browsable Maven repo could be removed at any moment and without warning. Needless to say that you can't build a production build against that. Then again, if you have the archived Maven repo you can simply host it locally.
This will be really useful. Thanks! 
if there's not an implementation in spring, there's an abstraction layer which makes dealing with the actual thing easier (in my head, I'm thinking about Caching)
This is very bad solution, because the time that you are waiting, you are still occupying processor. Please do not use this solution.
Generally, yeah... one exception would be EIP - Camel is probably a better answer than Spring
Disclaimer: I'm the lead developer of the project. Yay! First off thanks to everyone who gave suggestions and feedback to make this release possible! If you haven't heard of XChart yet, it's our ambitious project similar to JFreeChart - charts for Java Apps. I guess it would work on Android devices to, but I haven't tried it out yet. There are a lot of new features in this release as listed below. We've been getting about one download of the library daily on average, and I'm trying to up that to 2 per day by increasing the awareness of the project. If you have any feature requests please feel free to submit them to our [Github Issues](https://github.com/timmolter/XChart/issues?state=open) page. Thanks for looking! **XChart Features** * No additional dependencies * ~85KB Jar * Line charts * Scatter charts * Area Charts * Bar Charts * Error bars * Logarithmic axes * Date and category X-Axis * Multiple series * Extensive customization * Themes * Right-click, Save-As... * User-defined axes range * Custom legend placement 
It makes your laptop nice and toasty for your cold legs though.
How does this library do for streaming data? Data is constantly added, and I need constant refreshing (which also means it has to be FAST). The only thing I've found that works is jchart2d, which is visually a little plain. This looks promising, nice work! 
Also, how does this handle large data sets? Like tens of thousands of points. And is it zoom able? 
I was also able to reproduce the bug, on the machine of one of my clients! :) The output are copied by hand, I hope I have made no typo. The machine is based on an Intel Core2 Duo E7500 running at 2,93 GHz. It has 8 GB of RAM (and plenty of disk space). It runs Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1, 64-bits edition. If I just run `java` on the command line, I run this JVM: java version "1.6.0_29" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.4-b02, mixed mode) Using BugJava6Cmd: no problem, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 Using BugJava6Ecl: the bug occurs!, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: a was reset from 475 to 1 at BugJava6Ecl.main(BugJava6Ecl.java:8) Using BugJava6Ecl2: the bug occurs!, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 c:\Program Files\Java\jre6 Sun Microsystems Inc. Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: a was reset from 462 to 1 at BugJava6Ecl2.main(BugJava6Ecl.java:10) Now, here is where it gets very interesting. On the same machine, it appears there is another installation of the same JRE. On that one, I cannot reproduce the bug! The difference? It runs the Client VM instead of the Server VM. Here are the details: java version "1.6.0_29" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 20.4-b02, mixed mode, sharing) Using BugJava6Cmd: no problem, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 Using BugJava6Ecl: no problem, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 Using BugJava6Ecl2: no problem, here is the output: 1.6.0_29 c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6 Sun Microsystems Inc. So, it seems this bug only occurs on the 64-Bit Server VM. Hopefully, this information, along with the three compiled class files, will help resolve the bug (if Oracle still cares, considering it does not happen on Java 7, and Java 6 has reached its public end-of-life).
I do not envy those Oracle Workers, guys/gals must be working 24/7. Every week there is a new hole..
And it's not just Oracle. Every time this happens, partners in the OpenJDK community are also rushed to get fixed versions out via the various builds that are used (mostly Linux distros).
That's awesome! The library I'm currently using takes much longer. Does a line chart have similar results? 
Of course you can add the question! Also, suggestion on adding streaming capability : have automatic data management. For example, setting the limit of points to n, and when you add a point when there's already n points, the first point is removed. Jchart2d does this and it works very well from a usability perspective. However, it uses a LinkedList which is pretty inefficient (since the number of points is known, it should really be an array or array list). Edit: briefly looked at the source, and it looks like you can use whatever collection you want. Yay! 
That's why whenever I'm building something new, I like to take the [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/getting-started/#building-fat-jars) -- which is just an implementation of [The 12-factor App](http://www.12factor.net/port-binding) -- especially the parts about being self-contained. It's a leap to get there for some folks, but once you're there, it makes life a lot easier. This works especially well in rest backend + thick UI (ember, angular, etc). 
Can you gimme a quick explanation why? Or an example. I'm all ears, but this is near blasphemy. 
Camel is more mature, has more modules, has better configuration options, (ironically) integrates better with Spring, and has better tooling and developer support. Spring integration has a better parent company.
This is (potentially) big. My questions are: What tradeoffs will there be (and there will be) in terms of performance and functionality? Will there be any issues with an application running in a "double sandbox" that there wouldn't be with a natively coded app? Would it be more time-consuming to learn this porting process, edit an existing project to fit the requirements and maintain two similar, but different source codes, or to simply learn the Obj-C syntax and existing libraries for traditional porting? Also, will the included JVM contain only the components necessary to make the app function or does the whole JVM have to be included with each app binary? 
I'll be ditching JBoss AS 7 as soon as Glassfish 4 hits GA. I've been sticking to standards as best I could so the transitions shouldn't be tough.
I just read http://arjan-tijms.blogspot.com/2012/11/implementing-container-authentication.html and JASPIC sounds like some not perfect way to implement your own security realm except now it is portable. Maybe database vendors and directory server vendors will create these but why would an application developer ever go to that much effort? And it is EE 6 full profile only... EE 6 needs a standard way to programmatically provision users and groups with existing realms, not a way to roll everything from scratch and then register it with the server just so you can use declarative security. Much easier just to switch your db to store user data in a database and then treat that db just that any other table from within the application.
Thanks, I knew it had to be something obvious. So I'll just implement additional rules that sanitize metacharacters, that ought to work.
Hahaha, I didn't see that this was in the Java subreddit at first and was trying to figure out how people in Java were collecting their garbage in parallel :) 
Sounds good. May I ask, though, if you need a DSL that works like regex, why not just use regex? Also, be careful if you're not just doing this for a fun project. Generating regex is very prone to attacks that waste processor time. Interestingly, I can't think of a "standard" way to escape all the regex metacharacters. You can check all of them yourself, but that's error-prone.
Use Pattern.quote() 
Pattern.quote() 
[And the best part is, *I'm learning!*](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk0g93ymUH1qenxwio1_500.jpg) Thanks Edit: This also quoted the \s* and \s+, so what I ended up doing was wrapping the entire thing in \Q and \E, and unquoting it for special characters. String transformDSL(String name) { name = "\\Q" +name.replaceAll("%", "%%") .replaceAll("__+", "\\\\E\\\\s+\\\\Q") // __+ -&gt; \\E\\s+\\Q -&gt; \E\s+\Q .replaceAll("_", "\\\\E\\\\s*\\\\Q") // _ -&gt; \E\s*\Q +"\\E"; return name; }
Well, son of a bitch. I skimmed the API for this, but missed that. Thanks! 
Camel - more modules. Spring Integration - much better documentation.
Run your Java code in a servlet container as a servlet and use HTML forms and the http request/response models to control your input and output
If you want context, you should give it to us. Are you working on a Swing UI? Web? Servlet? What are the parameters of your method? It's generally a good thing to provide *some code* when asking a question, especially when it's as demanding as yours ("Please, give me some code that works, thanks"). You should always provide some code even if it doesn't work, so that we, the people trying to help you, can know what your possible mistakes are and where your train is thought is going. As for your question, generally speaking you'll want to have this sort of code in your button trigger: String parameter = txtField.getText(); someMethod(parameter);

In a few weeks :P 
sorry I made a tiny mistake. Use i * j not (i - 1) * (j - 1). I forgot array indexes start at 0 not 1 so the second column and row where the 1s are located will be at index 1, the 2s at 2, etc. edit: you should also use printf not println. printf let's you format your output so you can align your numbers into a nice rectangle edit 2: try using the width feature of printf so all your printed values have the same width whether they are 1, 2, or 3 digits. Also I think printf can also right align all your numbers, but not 100% sure.
Thanks for your comment. We plan on adding streaming soon. And we already have a GGPlot2 theme. [Here](http://xeiam.com/images/xchart_BarChart05.png) is a GGPlot2 themed bar chart example. I'll check out the JavaFX look as a possible next theme...
I understand that, and I don't expect it to work. I think it's a bad idea to introduce such a subtle change that will have consequnces within such a small window. If we had been using java 7 everywhere, the developer would have deployed code that is going to break during the last week of the year. What's worse is if it's not found out and solved during that week, the problem will appear to just go away. Anyway, trumpetx is right, we need to use JodaTime. My specific point was about the use case for week year. I'm assuming it has some use when working with accounting periods but beyond that I'm not sure.

I see, this answers a lot, thanks so much! I understand that this might be a low priority for Oracle, but several environments which are very methodical about software updates still use Java 6 (medical industry, government sites, etc), so I hope they at least acknowledge the bug if nothing else, and tag it with a WONTFIX or something... Thanks for your diligence, it was very discouraging seeing so many people in the thread dismiss/downvote my findings, or suggest that I had a virus or faulty RAM... It was also very discouraging seeing that 0% of other developers could duplicate my findings
Someone better at singing should fork this.
Sure, I'll be glad to help: 1. A 2. E 3. D 4. F B A B A C E 
&gt; or suggest that I had a virus or faulty RAM Ah ah, that was me too. :) I have had colleagues with faulty RAM who spent half a day blaming software before agreeing to test their RAM. I also had corrupted data because of a stuck bit, it took a while to discover there even was a problem. So, faulty RAM is always a possibility when encountering such weird behavior. It was interesting to reproduce the issue, and I'm glad we were able to pinpoint it to (most likely) a bug in the 64-bits Server VM.
I'll be wary of using GlassFish the day it's released. JBoss AS had its bugs, but GlassFish sure has had a couple of weird ones as well.
At least with Glassfish you know you'll always have the latest and greatest with the least amount of bugs. JBoss AS 7.1.1 has hundreds of bugs that have since been fixed on JBoss EAP.
Thanks. I'll look more into it
&gt;EE 6 needs a standard way to programmatically provision users and groups with existing realms, This maybe nice, but how would this exactly work? What would be the type of the user that you would store? Would you store a JAAS Subject? This thing can have arbitrary complexity, being a collection of Principals, where GroupPrincipals (not to be confused with the security concept of groups/roles!) can each have a collection of Principals themselves. If the underlying store is openID, there is probably not more than a username/password that you can save. If it's a DB you can store more stuff, but you might need ORM-like mapping to store anything more than a simple username/password and a collection of roles. Then, how do you handle different kinds of authentication mechanisms, like certs or keys that are attached to a user? The idea is cool, but it's probably going to be non-trivial. There is something called the Identity API that's in the works for some future Java EE version. Never really looked at it, but maybe this will offer this kind of functionality. 
yea netbeans has all the buit-in shit which makes it easier and simpler !
I don't know any clojure, but that article seemed to me more as a lecture on design pattern and OOP rather than anything else. Nice read though.
Wow. This looks awesome for some prelim stress testing as well. Really gonna push my team to allow this into use.
Good introduction to GC!
Netbeans has surpassed Eclipse? For maven and glassfish I think so. For everything else, no.
It's also very useful to check that your code is thread-safe, i.e can handle concurrency without any race condition occuring.

Presumably the site's a bit better if javascript's enabled, as without it some of the resources aren't loaded (namely the left-hand section) and most of the links on the home page don't lead anywhere. Poor site design doesn't fill me with confidence that the information on there's going to necessarily be 100% accurate.
I found this bit particularly depressing: &gt;Apparently the most common MySQL drivers launches a thread in the background cleaning up your unused and unclosed connections. So far so good. The way to deal with people forgetting to close connections is to tell them to fix the bug in their code. Setting up a background thread to find and close unclosed connections is punishing the competent programmers.
The timers on the quizes are extremely frustrating, some other weird quirks with the site too. **Really great content though**. Some bad design decisions that makes the site look like its from 2003.
OK I'm a bit stupid: In this context, what is JCR? Journal Citation Reports?

I don't think he's a developer, he's just trying to run java apps.
Nah. The singing might not be the best, but when you reach release-nirvana you just can't help but love everything about the world. "Oh, a bug? &lt;code&gt; &lt;fix&gt; &lt;commit&gt; &lt;released&gt;" It's so amazing.
Java Content Repository - Simply put it's a node-based (tree structured) database.
Nice. I think it has quite some potential if it got a bit more well-known and if it had more contributors...
If you need a mapping library in 2013 you are doing it wrong. (unless...you are dealing with an old code base then its kind of ok). Everyone should really start transitioning to functional style simple data structures, and classes for meta data storage.
These are some very simple take aways from Clojure. I honestly recommend just picking up the Clojure jar and experiment with the language. You can begin to learn about closures and functional programming and how it differs from OOP
Can you cite some resources showing non-trivial real-world applications that can do entirely without mapping between different domain models? Or are you confusing "old code base" with "established, matured system", which has grown into situations where - well - domain model mapping is just one of the features needed in everyday work when various large systems interoperate?
that would need way more arguments than a two-liner. I'm not against the idea, but i'd like to know how you would just discard DTOs.
Quick question, why are you switching your variables around on your recursive call: &gt; return y + mul(y,x-1); shouldn't it be &gt; return x + mul(x,y-1); it seems that for every call to your recursive method, it switch x and y around, hence the wrong results. 
Here you go: public static int multiply(int x, int y){ if(x==0 || y==0){ return 0; } if(y==1){ return x; } return x+ multiply(x, y-1); } edit: forgot 0 condition
Ah cool, I'll have to take a look. I recently found another similar tool called Orika, if you want to check it out.
Nice, I should assemble a list of similar tools. These seem to be all quite useful with Spring's JDBCTemplate ([RowMapper](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/RowMapper.html)) or [jOOQ's](http://www.jooq.org) [RecordMapper](http://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org/jooq/RecordMapper.html)

Thank you. Viewed it and enjoyed it.
I think I will use this with our end to end integration tests against our development environment. Thanks.
OK, clearly you can't run platform-dependent code anywhere you want. If you have some code for controlling the booster rockets of a space shuttle (yes I know that will probably not be written in Java, ever) it will also not run on your mobile phone. However, something like Apache Commons Compress (for handling zip and tar files and such) runs happily inside JEE containers, JVM's running on a desktop, or Android devices.
I concur with habitats. These are just best practices that have been preached about and authored in many books (many Java and C++ books as a matter of fact) well before Clojure was even conceived.
Unless you want to pollute your db-mapped classes with fields and methods used by the view layer (there could be multiple view layers), webservices ,etc. there's no way to avoid maintaining separate classes for each of these in non-trivial projects. My understanding is that this library would make the conversion from one to the other very easy.
Spring's pretty modular. I'm so-so on the dependency injection stuff and MVC, although it's still a valid choice, but things like RestTemplate and JdbcTemplate are gold imo.
We still use it where I work, but only for dependency injection. We're in the process of converting to CDI though...
The titles to the article and the reference link are offensive even though the author acknowledges they are inherent to OO. Too bad he never spent the time to learn Java in depth. Good content, negative rating for sensationalism &amp; obfuscation by controversy.
Spring, not really for me. There are a lot of Spring projects out there so experience might be required for some shops but I personally consider Spring to be a legacy framework. Some shops are really slow to updated to the latest EE versions so you might have to use Spring if you want some modern features but are stuck with old EE servers. You mention hibernate, The Java Persistence API (JPA) is basically the standard for hibernate at this point. Learn JPA and then if you want you can learn the hibernate specific extensions. JPA is how you will do database access. Put both on a resume though, most people don't understand the relationship.
We just standardized on Spring at my company, even though most feel it was a push from the VMware sales guys, and we are doing everything RESTFUL using Spring MVC with HTML JS and CSS being the only technologies client side, no JSP. It is working ok, but I prefer dynamically typed languages for the web.
I think my answer would be that CERTAIN PARTS of Spring are still relevant. The JDBC stuff is still very much, the web services stuff is great, security... DI, MVC, maybe not QUITE as much. As others have said though, it's so modular, if you treat it like more of a library like Apache Commons, where you pick and choose bits, rather than an all encompassing "platform", like JEE, then it's really never "irrelevant". 
Lol@portlets. They peaked in popularity in about 2003. Spring is still very relevant. There's always a push for the next big thing, but I don't think anything in the Java world really touches it for quality and features. If anything the competing frameworks are ones outside the Java world.
I'm not sure how DI is in any way no longer relevant.
I'm a Java enterprise developer, and most Java projects in my country (Belgium) are being done with Spring nowadays. Together with Hibernate it's the defacto-standard. Spring was (and still is) an answer on everything what's wrong with the Java EE standard. Java EE 6 took a lot of ideas from Spring, and is thus a lot better than in the EJB 2.x days. But still, they are evolving a lot slower than Spring. Annotation-based dependency injection in Spring works just great, and has more options and features than CDI. Making your business layer transactional is very easy and non-intrusive in Spring because Spring has such a great AOP framework. On my current project we use Spring MVC and it's the nicest classic request-based MVC framework I've ever seen. I worked with Wicket before (a component based web framework) which is really great to do rapid Web application development, but it will never offer the same level of control you will have with Spring MVC. Oh and with Spring MVC it's easy to build a JSON REST service, so I don't see what Spring is missing there?
Just wondering, what do you don't like on the dependency injection stuff of Spring?
I used Eclipse for years, but since a year I use IntelliJ ... and it's just great! I will never switch back!
Our current framework sits on Spring, if we really wanted to we could get away from it, but it does so much for us that we're sitting pretty. I think its still relevant, and like other users have said they have a lot going on for them, maybe not everything, but a good amount.
CDI doesn't need to run in a Java EE container. It's a specification, and you choose an implementation (if you use a container, the choice is made for you). For example, [Weld](http://seamframework.org/Weld) implements CDI and can be run in ordinary Java SE.
Being able to sell yourself. Delivering results.
I've used it before to good effect, but in the company I'm in, it ends up being piles of random xml and properties files, with not enough discipline to use it correctly.
&gt; Java EE 6 took a lot of ideas from Spring, and is thus a lot better than in the EJB 2.x days. But still, they are evolving a lot slower than Spring. Correction, Java EE 5 took some ideas from Spring, and some ideas from Hibernate. Both were asked to join in the effort to make Java EE a better J2EE. Hibernate came aboard, Spring declined. As for Java EE 6, Spring took ideas from Java EE there. Type safe injection? Java EE had it first. No XML? Java EE had it first. Contextual injections? Java EE had it first. Not to say that Spring is always behind. Their caching annotations are pretty slick in Spring 3.1 and Java EE which should have gotten this too earlier just completely dropped the ball. As I said before though, Java EE's job is not to be super innovative, but to standardize that what has proven to work. It's thus explicitly not the intension for Java EE to introduce super new stuff and to release a new version every year or even every few months.
I should also point out that just because something is part of J2EE doesn't make everything else "irrelevant"... One can use whatever tool one sees fit to use... like people used hibernate instead of EJB CMP...
REST in spring MVC is super easy and IMO one of the best REST frameworks out there. Even though the company I work for uses spring + jersey for REST, I think spring's REST solution is better. 
I think that a lot of those high-paying contracts go to niche product skills. Like a particular app server, CMS, message queue, CRM or something like that. When a company pays millions for licenses for some software they don't know how to use, an expert can just bend them over a barrell and pick their pocket. I actually fell into this in the middle of my career where I got hired at a rate I really didn't deserve solely based on product knowledge. If you want to get top pay as a generalist, the key will be having a leadership role on a some successful projects. At the upper echelons of seniority, skill set becomes less critical than management skills.
There's less incentive to use a "proprietary" solution like Spring in new applications when there is a standard solution (CDI). Just like there's less incentive to use a "proprietary" solution like Hibernate these days when there is a standard solution (JPA). Interestingly, Hibernate can be used as a JPA provider, while Spring cannot be used as a CDI provider. In that way, Spring *can be seen* as irrelevant in the grand scheme of things *as a DI framework*. That does not mean there are plenty of cases where Spring is very useful, and it can and should and does maintain relevance in those areas. EDIT: The word proprietary has two meanings. In general it means owned by one entity, the proprietor. In technical usage in the software industry, it means closed source. I don't know how to convey that difference in usage except with air-quotes.
Spring 3 is very relevant and writing REST services is a cinch. We use it every day at my job (small web consulting firm). But.... you should base it on whether firms in your area are looking for spring expertise. I tend to get a lot of recruiter hits looking for spring, but it is on my resume :) edit: rest controller example (icecastServerDao.getAll() returns a list of java objects from the db, and @ResponseBody converts them to json automatically!) @RequestMapping(value="/icecast", method=RequestMethod.GET) public @ResponseBody List&lt;IcecastServer&gt; getIcecastServers(){ return icecastServerDao.getAll(); }
:D
You should have heard the rest of us sing... ;)
:D
I don't think you understand proprietary software. You just called two of the biggest open-source software projects proprietary. Then you go on to suggest we use the proprietary closed source J2EE. Important -&gt; Standards != proprietary. Close source software == proprietary.
Ehh, [proprietary software.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)
That's not the context in which I used the word "proprietary". English is a language where the words can have many shades of meaning. What is free software?
"The term "free software" and its exact definition,[3] as well as the freedom philosophy behind it, were coined and have developed since the beginning of the GNU project (to create a freedom-respecting operating system) and the founding of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 by Richard Stallman. Free software differs from proprietary software, which to various degree does not give the user freedoms to study, modify and share the software." [Free Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) You can contribute to Spring so not sure where this is going, if you want to call if proprietary, do it. To my knowledge the only thing they keep complete control of are the XML api's. I think a better adjective would have suited your point better but I don't want to go on about free as in beer / free as in software.
You're right, I should have said Spring DI specifically... although I'm honestly not in love with DI generically like many other people... but I wouldn't dare call it irrelevant generally, my bad for not being specific enough. 
Nearly every Java job posting will mention Spring and Hibernate experience as a requirement. I think I've seen EJB3 mentioned maybe once in all the ones I've ever looked at. If you're worried about skills marketability then there's not really any competition, it's Spring all the way.
Depends on the whether or not it's 32 or 64 bit windows 8 I think. 
if you are using a 64 bit version of win8 then 64 bit eclipse
Any reason I should stop using Spring? What benefits does CDI give me? It appears to be JEE oriented to me, as opposed to JSR-330
Personally I'd say no... I can't think of any really compelling reason if you're already using Spring. Maybe new projects you go CDI if only to remove one third-party dependency from the mix. 
Everything is third party :)
I guess once CDI is used anywhere near as much as spring, I'll agree. I prefer to bind myself to Spring rather than a JEE container. Then I can use my modules outside of JEE as well as inside it
True, as Obi-Wan said, from a certain point of view :) 
I'm digging Play! these days, and as a plus transitioning to Scala is fairly painless (other than learning Scala of course).
I would say it would be in your best interest to learn both Spring and JEE 6 CDI. Spring has been the king of the ring for so long and has so many existing applications out there that will need maintenance for a long time yet to come. And some people will even continue to start up new projects with it as well. Others will start new projects with JEE 6 or might want to convert from Spring to JEE 6 in which case you would have to be knowledgeable in both to be able to be most effective on such a project.
CDI does not require a container. I've used it in a couple of Java SE applications.
Spring MVC (what you have described) is not the same as the Spring Framework - it is merely a part of it. My company uses Spring across a multitude of applications. We use the basic framework components for IoC and DI, database development, REST endpoints, SOA and Spring Integration to distributed services. Spring is still highly relevant and will remain so for years to come. Your specification of HTML, jQuery, and JSON are all front-end concerns - unrelated to the back-end implementation where Spring is used. The two are, essentially, mutually exclusive. To further that point, we use HTML, jQuery and JSON on our front-ends, as well as other frameworks such as Knockout. Backbone.js and AngularJS are also commonly used. While you can easily make a living focusing solely on JEE 6, you ignore Spring at your own peril. Employers still want it and will continue to do so.
Then why don't you use dependency injection through annotations?
Your link backs him up. From the overview: &gt; According to Eric S. Raymond, in the Jargon File, "In the language of hackers and users" it is used pejoratively, with the meaning of "inferior" and **"a product not conforming to open-systems standards"** Emphasis mine. There is a standard and Spring does not follow it, thus it is proprietary, ie. non-standard.
Can't be worse than my singing
You can definitely use the term proprietary in combination with open source software. It means it's specific for a certain product, instead of something open. There are many open source implementations of JPA, and they all have some proprietary features. Meaning, they are still all fully open source, but they offer some stuff that is not in the JPA standard. Likewise, there are many C++ compilers that are open source, and most of them have some amount of proprietary switches or syntax. Meaning, they are still open source, but if you use such a proprietary feature your code won't compile with an other C++ compiler. Etc.
I don't think your question suits this subreddit particularly well, this is meant more to discuss Java, not troubleshoot it. You might want to head over to /r/techsupport.
The problem is that all the Spring-ish features of Java EE 6 seem disjointed and cheaply copied without changing the base model of things. And exactly the base model differences (Spring beans vs Enterprise Beans) seem to make the most difference to me. The Spring model just makes so much more sense. If you don't want Spring you could also take a look at Guice or some other light-weight framework.
This is an excellent article and highlights some of the pain points around the JVM in a world that is going increasingly mobile. Hopefully Oracle will come up with some interesting stuff soon with getting proper "native" JVM support across all platforms. 
As a beginning Java programmer I really wish I had a cheatsheet with all those abbreviations. I mean, I get JVM, but it kinda stops there... Though it's an interesting read nonetheless.
There's a difference between what I want to happen and what apparently has happened. :) Not my doing.
1. Short answer yes but it depends on the application server configuration. Clustering for example allows you to allocate resources on a war basis.
This could be very interesting, I just hope that it won't take too long.
Whilst Spring is endemic within enterprise I've noticed a move away from it in the last few years in my own experience, certainly when it comes to basics like dependency injection and threading (i.e. spring integration). I've seen Guice gaining more traction but that was primarily because a lot of developers were sick of wading through reams of XML. Personally I can't say I've ever finished a project and thought to myself "I'm really glad we used Spring". On the other hand I have spent many evenings in the pub with colleagues with conversations that started "F**king Spring.......". That said Spring is an essential tool to understand if you intend working in large enterprises and for better or worse I don't see it becoming irrelevant within Enterprise for many years to come. 
Dude. You're *using* the ultimate cheat sheet - Internet. If you really want to progress as a programmer, ask your friend Wikipedia, goooooooogle, and/or Bing for clarification when you don't understand a term, preferably before reading further. If you instead look terms up later, consider re-reading the original text afterwards. Studies have shown that comprehension and retention of text in which a single unrecognized word was skipped goes down by mumble percent. I don't mean to be that "just google it" guy, just trying to help. Speaking of which - feel free to reply with any unfamiliar terms from TFA, and I'm sure that I or someone else would be happy to help.
Good chance that the answer is somewhere in here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10165693/eclipse-cannot-load-swt-libraries
I never understood the assertion that static methods are problematic for unit testing. Static methods are the consummate unit test. With a static method that returns int... assertTrue(isDefined(SomeClass.class)); assertTrue(isInt(SomeClass.staticMethod("value")); ... assertTrue(isMyObject(SomeOtherClass.usesStatic("value2"))); You mock things that have state. That's why you need to mock them. If it's static (stateless) and present, why do you need to mock them? So you can show decoupling? A static method results in a type, mock the return type. 
Well, some static methods do change the state. A static method can change static fields. And if that happens you are out of luck with respect to mocking or faking them.
Static methods are problematic when their results are not contained. A `getInstance()` method could start a chain reaction which leads to external effects, such as opening a database connection, which would make unit tests no longer isolated and make the "unit" much more difficult to test by itself. These are the kinds of methods the author was referring to, while admitting that static methods are fine for stateless utility methods. You can't mock a static method, because mocking is implemented by creating a proxy subclass of the mocked class. Since static methods belong to the mocked class, you can't return a mocked return type of a static method. That said, with some tricky classloader manipulation and bytecode rewriting, [PowerMock](https://code.google.com/p/powermock/) lets you mock both static and final methods.
Sweet now I can get 0-day exploited on my iphone!
Good luck with your homework. If you run into trouble, I'm sure your lecturer will be happy to be your primary contact for help - after all, that's what she gets paid for.
Stating the obvious, but the failed reflect invoke indicates it cannot find a library. So potentially you are mixing 32 and 64 bit JVMs, Or tell it where to find swt by creating an appropriate sym link. Edit: just saw Taylee's comment, try that. Edit2: likely not an ownership or permissions issue,but it the swt libraries are where eclipse is looking you may want to verify.
If after much deliberation, planning, and designing you decided that the only way to implement some part of your system was to use static fields through static methods, then I don't think mocking or faking them is the worst of your problems.
What's it do? 
I think you messed something up. [JSONMenuBar.java](https://github.com/AndrewBGM/JSONMenuBar/blob/master/JSONMenuBar.java) holds `public class ExampleMenu extends JSONMenuBar` -- where is the actual JSONMenuBar class?
*facepalm* Commiting now...
Found this thread just browsing back a while, and wanted to give you a long overdue +1 and upvote for Mint.
The example needs some callbacks.
You've started, that's good! The crucial invokeCallback() is.. not yet there - I kind of wondered what that magic dispatcher would look like. :) I won't delve on style, package name etc. now. I understand you are probably coming from Python, it takes some time to get use to the verbosity of Java. (I've been there!). Some way to build the project would be good. Industry standard is [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html#Quick_Start) (please, no more ant!). Any build tool should as a minimum be able to fetch that outdated JSON library for you. I made you a [pom.xml](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5126895) to get you started, it should work with just *mvn clean install* - or to run your main(): mvn install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ExampleMenu" You might want to try some of the newer brothers like [Buildr](http://buildr.apache.org/quick_start.html) and [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) which would be perhaps less verbose than Maven and easier to get started with.
Dude.. java.io.FileNotFoundException: example-json.json (No such file or directory) 
That's for javascript, not java.
Shit! My mistake.
To learn Java, you should be really familiar with Object Oriented Programming. It will likely be a little confusing at first, but once you have that "click" moment, it will make perfect sense. I now think of almost every problem as an OOP one (which I am trying to change by learning Haskell, a functional language). I would read the Oracle tutorials on Java and torrent a copy of Thinking In Java if you can't find it via Google (though if I'm not mistaken, the author publishes it for free). For IDEs, most Java programmers seem to use Eclipse or Netbeans. I prefer Netbeans myself. You should also know how to compile and run Java from the command line, both in Linux and in Windows. Furthermore, make sure you have a working JDK (Java Development Kit) so that you can compile your .java files into .class files, and then a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) so that you can run your .class files. I think that a JDK usually comes with a JRE, but it's been a while since I installed one. Here are some good topics to look up on Wikipedia and elsewhere: - Object oriented programming - Polymorphism - Inheritance - Access modifiers - Abstract classes - Methods and attributes - Static scoping vs. Dynamic scoping (since you know some python) - Compiling vs. Interpreting (since you know some python)
A starting point [JavaTutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) Last discussion I recall on [IDEs](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/19n8jv/i_had_to_skip_java_programming_one_in_my_new/c8pkh7t) and check out links on right in /r/learnprogramming and some of the other sub-reddits on the right here
Java isn't a "command" based language. If anything, it's Object driven that contains methods. There are packages of classes that distributed with all JREs. Specifically for what your trying to program, it might be different for what is important to you. Try looking at Java Docs. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/
You might want to define the path of your JDK in the eclipse config.
It honestly doesn't matter. 
Use IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ Of course the IDE is just an environment, you still need to learn the fundamentals, but a good IDE will help you. This should be your #1 reference (other than a search engine), it is a textbook-quality reference for Java: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ Even though I am 10 year veteran, I still rely on it any time I need a thorough explanation of a particular area. It has good tutorials, including a 'starting from scratch' section, but don't let the name fool you - it's a quite thorough textbook 
Most of the people doing real work are busy writing code (and likely deploying on Oracle's implementation, not that it matters...), not online posting philosophical comments :)
What does that matter. Since when did producing quality software become relevant?!
As someone who has used the 'paid version' for many years, I totally disagree. Whenever I am forced to use the community edition, it doesn't feel limited at all. Sometimes I miss Spring integration, and back when I had a clearcase project, I missed the clearcase plugin... but other than that.. you get maven integration and version control in the free version. what else do you need?
The file's there, you're calling java from a directory different than where the file is. Relative paths start from where java is invoked. Add this to the catch in ExampleMenu.java to see where java wants to load it from and fix your setup. System.out.println(jsonFile.getAbsolutePath());
What you did is great mostly because you realized a general purpose and solved your problem with a re-usable, clearly-defined approach. you should add javadocs - not because you want to read generated javadocs, but because that's the standard way of documenting code in Java. And it becomes one of the most critical descriptive pieces of re-usable modules. Once you build 20, you will be surprised how often you refer to the javadocs rather than the code, for code that you wrote yourself. (In other words, in larger systems, you want to build many independent modules to solve different kinds of problems, and clearly defining the system and its parts becomes a very important, if not necessary, part of the design) for example, /** Build menu items based on the "items" property of the given JSON object. Each item will have a menu built for it */ public void buildMenuBar( JSONObject object ) { something like this helps more clearly articulate the purpose of the code, and even the act of writing it helps you to contextualize the purpose of what is being written with regards to an external system which might integrate it. in my experience, even though when i write the code i dont need the documentation, 10 times out of 10 I find myself coming back to that code at a later time when I want to (re)use it and it's made so much easier because I described the important details in a doc. now it's become engrained in me to write *more* than is necessary, and I've never run into a case where I regretted doing so. good work! 
Start over by getting STS Eclipse build, and create a new maven application, then copy your source in. 
Dude, read more articles by content and not by headline. Java applications aren't insecure - the browser plugin is. And I'm going to bet my left testie that a browser plugin will never ever surface on the iOS platform. Stop spreading FUD now please.
I think the "Head First Java" book from O'Reilly is really great. (ISBN is 978-0-596-00920-5) It's for anyone with 0 understanding of programming (if you have some you can just skim through some of the first chapters). By the end you'll know almost everything The_Sober_Grudge suggested. It worked great for me, to illustrate this, I have half a meter of books from my education that I barely read, and I almost fly through this one. Every chapter has some "assignments" (more like fun puzzles) that challenge you to apply the knowledge you learned. And please, please start copying and experimenting (also commenting) with the code from the book, it helps A LOT.
Because I like to solve problems. I can create elegant solutions. Also, laziness, impatience, and hubris are part of my DNA and go and in hand with your desire to develop software.
Props for parent taking the time to create the pom file and guide the next generation of Java developers that will make sure I still have a job in 20 years :)
How do I find where java is installed? I installed via a ppa.
How do you make symbolic links?

One of things I like is that you don't have to stick to one context if you don't want to. You could be working on code for a space ship one day, and then an Android app the next day. The possibilities are endless and it really opens the door for you to continue learning new things outside of software development. Another thing I enjoy a lot is the software engineering side of things. I see the job of a software developer as somebody who creates and organizes information. I feel like you need some kind of intuition to organize and manage the information appropriately so that that code is easy to manage at a later stage. So, designing code that is reusable and easy to follow is something that I appreciate a lot.
My main concern was the initial size. I had to write a big report on this program for class. One section was titled Data Structures. I got into some trouble for putting a 21,024,000 byte *minimum* data structure in there. I cut it by two by switching to floating points, but was curious if I was doing the right thing here or totally ignoring a more viable option. 
Hmm... well, it's hard to answer this question without a better understanding of the requirements. 10,512,000 is a conceptual minimum for the actual data itself, if all of it is loaded in memory at once--you could simply access it using a calculation based on the all of those degrees of choice (day, row, column) and only require one pointer for the starting location of the structure (along with any other JVM heap overhead that I'm missing, if any). On the other hand, maybe you are working in a memory limited environment or need only a little bit of data loaded. In which case you need to pick data structures which allow you to effectively store and retrieve the data without incurring too much overhead. I suspect that creating this type of data storage is really the problem that your professor wanted you to solve, or at least consider in your choice of a solution.
I didn't think you could have a space in the name of a div? When you have something with a space, I thought it related to something like this; post a {css} &lt;div id="post"&gt; &lt;a href="#"&gt;asdasd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
Because it feels good to create something (an app) from nothing and then pass it onto to someone / some group who then uses your newly created tool with much joy.

Look at what you posted above. Look at it. Are you proud of yourself? Next time you need help with Java: 1. Put a proper title on it. 2. Format it so it's readable (indent four spaces). 3. Post to /r/javahelp instead. 4. If it's homework, make sure you're allowed to ask the Internet. 
http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/ The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group - in particular look at the [software page](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml).
In css you would reference multiple class names in the same element with a dot between them, so try that.
Thanks a bunch!
no, it's called example-menu.json in Github and example-json.json in the code.
Those kind of files should anyway be read from the classpath using getClass().getResource(), the current directory is not going to work in a real application.
Netbeans is much better for new developers and IntelliJ is awesome once you know how things work.
My first experiences in Java were with Eclipse, NetBeans is pretty good but a lot of tutorial series I've seen seem to use Eclipse over it so that's why I suggested it, personally I use it and Intellij the most.
I'm not sure I agree with this: &gt;However, for client code to take advantage of this, there needs to be a simple way of providing a function to the collection methods. Currently the standard way of doing this is by means of an anonymous class implementation of the appropriate interface. But the syntax for defining anonymous inner classes is too clumsy to be practicable for this purpose. Am I the only one that thinks that the lambda syntax is just as, or more, clumsy than anonymous classes?
I think it'll take some getting used to, but once visualizing the boilerplate becomes ingrained in your thinking it should hopefully prove neater. As always, the level of clumsiness will be determined by the style of the individual developer, rather than the bounds of the syntax.
You can't do that. If you work in Java then you should be strong enough with the base language that you can answer questions. No one should expect you to have anything but the most common APIs memorized for the areas you claim familiarity with on your resume/CV. If you are weak in the core language then you need to spend some time learning Java. Take a look at the OCJA and OCJP exams. You should be able to pass them, if not then either work towards obtaining them or at least learning enough that you could obtain them. You'd be better off spending the day figuring out how participate better in an interview. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html and learn about the place you are applying, it is good if you can ask questions about your potential place of employment. Some places like to have you solve problems or ask about more general CS topics. You might want to look into things like http://www.algorithmsforinterviews.com/
Looks good
This guy should find a better way to show code in-line with his text.
The lambda syntax is much, much less clumsy than anonymous classes. Seriously. Not to mention method references.
&gt; Is Java going to be forever stuck behind other major platforms functionally? In form of syntactic sugar? Yes. Is that a problem? No. Just look at c++, it has so many language features that learning it takes an insanely long time. Not to mention the edge cases every new syntactic element introduces.
[Apache OpenNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org/), [Stanford's CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml), or [LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/) come to mind.
What was the solution? I'm really curious.
I wanted to make video games.
&gt;Am I the only one that thinks that the lambda syntax is just as, or more, clumsy than anonymous classes? Maybe. At the very least you're the only one I know of.
Current poll was previously "What technologies to you use or work with most often?" Evidence [here](http://i.imgur.com/sEgyoDX). Poll results were showing Android in the lead with over 50% (IIRC, it was mid-fifties). Next closes were Pythin and UML, both in the low thirties. Could just be a glitch in the poll page, of course, but, given the huge amount of love between Oracle and Google, and the fact that Android was far in the lead on the poll ...
Hey OP, this is the answer you are looking for.
I have faced a similar problem, and had to come up with a custom implementation which works closely with JUnit @Category annotation. @Category can be used with test classes and individual test methods too. You can have runner suites which run a set of Categories. We use bug id's in the @Category in some cases. Edit: an example for [JUnit @Category!](http://alexruiz.developerblogs.com/?p=1711)
I think that's more because of how they are implemented. C++ has almost no native features that were designed into the language intelligently. Compilers keep bolting on extensions willynilly and some make it into the language spec, whether they make complete sense or not.
Thanks for the response and the information! I'll get my reading hat on. My first programming language experience was with GameMaker, which I'll admit does a lot for you but it gave me the basis to understand general programming. I moved on to Javascript and have been building a Javascript game engine for... well a while. In regards to the invokeCallback method, what about it is not there yet? Not being mean just wondering how I can improve upon it.
Really? Lambda's are just syntactic sugar? No wonder the java world stays so behind (how long it took to finally get generics for example). Have fun writing 3x the code a C# dev does for the rest of your life.
To be really useful, partial application should be possible. Yet it's not mentioned. Did I overlook something?
&gt; Lambda's are just syntactic sugar? AFAIK they are nothing more but short hands for anonymous classes. Other than shorter code they provide no additional type safety or speedups. They are a purely visual enhancement - nice to write, nice to read. &gt; Have fun writing 3x the code a C# dev does for the rest of your life. Nobody sane writes boilerplate code by hand, any good IDE will take care of that automatically. 
Well it will work outside of eclipse, but only in command line or an equivalent. You would probably want to look into [JFrames] (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html) and [JTextFields] (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/textfield.html) to complete what you are looking for. Edit: By the way -- Good luck and welcome to programming in Java!
This does work outside of Eclipse. I just copied and pasted that code into a file called TriangleArea.java, then in a terminal I ran javac TriangleArea.java java TriangleArea and the program ran just fine. :-) Edit: what's happening above is the javac command takes the java text file and converts it into a language which the java program con understand. This is called compiling. Once the .java file is compiled, the resulting file can be run with the java command. Note that the file name must be the same as the class name, in this case, TriangleArea.java. Good luck and welcome to programming! I'm sure you'll love it as much as the rest of us. :-)
The easiest way I've found is to switch out the scanner with JOptionPanes. That's your first step into a GUI. So first, import javax.swing.JOptionPane; Then to get a string you do: String s = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Text for the dialog"); To turn a string into an integer: int i = Integer.parseInt(s); Or in more compact terms (this will do the above two steps in one line): int num = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Dialog Box")); The Integer.parseInt() method will throw an exception if what you put into the text box was not an integer. You can try a bit of "try" and "catch" here if you haven't done that before. try { Integer.parseInt(s); } catch(NumberFormatException e) { // This code runs if the string in the // text box could not be turned into an int. } Bonus bit of code, this pops up an information (not input) dialog. JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Your message here"); In Eclipse, do File &gt; Export... &gt; Java &gt; Runnable JAR File. Then you can just double click the file that makes to run the application. Good luck with Java! Feel free to message me if you need any more help.
Everything in every turing-complete language is syntactic sugar. That's the fundamental theorem of high-level language.
Java is a big ecosystem, but take a look at Apache Maven as tool to help manage projects from the command line. It plays well with eclipse and has some easy getting started tutorials. 
Everyone I know who starts out with lambda expressions says this. The longer you use it the more appealing it becomes. The only time I see unreadable lambda expressions is when they've been written by an IDE (ReSharper for Visual Studio can create some confusing ass linq). It really is lovely to be able to do this in one line: _myTypesSearchResults = new List&lt;MyTypeDto&gt;(itemsReturned.SearchResults.FirstOrDefault(k =&gt; k.Key == "myTypeIdentifier").Value.Cast&lt;MyTypeDto&gt;()); Instead of: _myTypesSearchResults = new List&lt;MyTypeDto&gt;(); foreach (var result in itemsReturned.SearchResults) { if (result.Key.Equals("myTypeIdentifier")) { foreach (var myType in result.Value) { _myTypesSearchResults.Add(myType as MyTypeDto); } } } I realise this is /r/java so apologies in advance to the other redditors with my heinous C# code.
Read this: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/runtime The first code sample will get you started. 
Seems very Java-like and nice to me. Like most Java enhancements the onus is on the API developers, where general usage is much sleeker. Unless you're writing your own collections framework or trying to do something too-clever the JDK8 lambdas hit a nice sweet spot. They give you most of what you want from 'functional programming' (collection iterators, transaction support, etc) and significantly shorten other places where anon-classes have been traditionally used. This is really too clunky? pointList.forEach(p -&gt; p.move(p.y, p.x)); All that comes with a zero penalty for speed, type safety, and IDE refactoring support, which is really what anybody using Java the language is after. If those aren't concerns the question becomes why aren't you using Groovy, Scala, or one of the 100 other, more terse, JVM languages?
I was like, "what the fuck is this guy on, that's not java". You actually made me think I was a complete moron who had completely missed half of a programming language for a second. Congrats :)
i've read many articles and none of them said anything about partial application, so i'm pretty sure they're not included. On the other hand, they're very really useful even like this. I'm looking forward for eclipse support and standard version
exacly. i think they implemented lambdas as best as they could, it integrates perfectly in the rest of the Java environment, they left out the minimal of functionalities, and it's gonna be super useful. They took a long time to develop lambdas? Sure, but java is not a one man pet project that can afford to screw things over, it's a platform used by billions of applications, devices and servers, with quite some legacy, and they put a lot of time trying to reach a reasonable result
how can you think that? it's plain stupid. One is 5 lines long, 127 characters, 12 parens, the other is a 42 characters one liner with 4 parens.
i have a question, the article talks about a Stream class, [here](http://www.lambdafaq.org/why-are-stream-operations-not-defined-directly-on-collection/), but i can't find it in the [official javadoc](http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/). Which is more up to date?
About the callback, I was wrongly led down to believe that the methods specified in the json would appear in the java code (say a fileOpen method), but instead I get a single, empty method (ehy not abstract?) where I have to dispatch myself. So the JSON file could give flexibility and extensibility, but there is no accompanying flexibility or extensibility on the method side. I suggest however to not get bogged in that now as it can be a long, sometimes dark path to go down in a static compiled language and perhaps just do some simple if-else dispatching in the example.
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/urlfetch/ http://jsoup.org/ I'm really having a hard time of understanding whether you want to create a simple service, or use an third party web service from Google App Engine.
Thanks! A very clear write up. Great for people who are learning abou Java classes and objects.
For web (Java EE, JSF), JSF "components" (widgets) are configured in xml, with references to Java classes for the back-end functionality. If the stock components don't suit your purpose, there are plenty of 3rd-party libraries, such as ICEfaces or PrimeFaces. Of course, you can always lay down JQuery snippets if there's no JSF component to suit your need. This doesn't nicely integrate with back-end structures, but it is more than sufficient for UI stuff, like selecting a state/province from a JQuery map instead of a drop-down list. Using JSF component libraries, I was able to build a functioning web-app replacement of an old desktop application. I had buttons, menus, selectors, text fields, tables, client-side and server-dependent components, and some custom JQuery components. EDIT: Check out the [ICEfaces showcase](http://icefaces-showcase.icesoft.org/showcase.jsf) for a good sampling of where the tools are at today.
Thanks mk_gecko, glad to hear that you find it useful.
Thanks, I notice you said your JSF app was built to replace a desktop application. Is it safe to assume that Java desktop applications are, or are becoming, a thing of the past?
What did your lecturer say, how did you relate to that?
My lecturer didn't teach this, I'm just self-teaching this to myself and couldn't understrand. Google isn't really returning anything.
How about like you're 12. A hashmap is like a magic coat check room. You hand your coat over and get a ticket. Whenever you give that ticket back, you immediately get your coat. You can have a lot of coats, but you still get your coat back immediately. There is a lot of magic going on inside the coat check room, but you don't really care as long as you get your coat back immediately.
So you have a lot of toys, right? And your mom and I make you put them away in a toy chest? A hashmap is basically like a magic toy chest, where you can put something in and tell it the name (key) like this: "Toy chest: here is a 'ball'". Later, you can ask for things (values) by name: "Toy chest, give me the thing I told you was called 'ball'". The toy chest doesn't keep things in any order - you don't know what it looks like inside. What matters is that you can put things in with a name, then later get the same things back by asking for that name. 
Thanks for the reply. Do I have to specify that I want the 'ball' back? Or can I simply say "toy chest give me what you have inside"? 
So every ticket associated with one specific coat, right? Is it possible to be associated with more than one?
Because a value of type T is not the same as a function that returns a value of type T?
Apart from IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans), they never were too much of a thing to begin with. Here are a few recent ones that I find useful and/or not bloated, and/or somewhat pretty and usable. I have used them all significantly at some point, and consider them good examples of what a decent Java Desktop Application should strive for: * [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html), an excellent free diagramming tool (and it's refreshing to see what a 26 MB Jar file can pack when compared to behemoths such as Eclipse) * [Astah](http://astah.net/), a excellent commercial UML tool (a free version is available, you can do all UML 2 diagrams in a commercial setting with it... but if you want to do team work, you will need to pay) * [JDiskReport](http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/), a nice free utility to help find which directories are eating your disk space * [Jajuk](http://jajuk.info/index.php/Main_Page), the Eclipse of the Media Players ;) (if you want to see modern Swing in action, this one is open source) * [JAlbum](http://jalbum.net/), a photo gallery manager/generator (not free anymore) * [Moneydance](http://moneydance.com/), a personal finance manager (not free) * [ThinkingRock](http://www.trgtd.com.au/), a personal productivity tool (old version is free), also an example of an application built with the Netbeans platform (not very pretty, but with many standard features such as plug-ins and update managers) * [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), an open-source MindMap tool Nowadays, with the shift to tablets and phones, and the need to have data always available in some kind of cloud, I find that desktop applications themselves are having a hard time. Many of the applications above have some sort of web mode, web data storage, and/or mobile companion app.
That would mean that (int x, int y) -&gt; 2*x+3*y is not the same as (int x) -&gt; ((int y) -&gt; 2*x + 3*y) // not sure if this works which will likely make explicit currying/uncurrying necessary.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.14.2
Currently, you have to use the JDK 8 preview version that includes the support for lambdas to use them and the related library functionality at all. The docs that include the related classes and interfaces are downloadable at the same address as the lambda-enabled preview version. They are here: http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/ The official javadoc should be updated to include Stream&lt;T&gt; and others at the same time as the support for lambdas is merged into the primary [Java 8 snapshot.](http://jdk8.java.net/download.html) That's at least how I understand they have planned it. 
Agree, it's quite a successes that Java is still backwards compatible to 1.0. I only do about half my new programming in Java and half in a scripting language that runs on the JVM. These changes may make me jump to the scripting language less. 
Yeah, in Swing. Web apps are an abomination. When some better alternative to Swing comes along (in an actual programming language, on the JVM, not some glorified PDP-11 assembly like C++ and Qt), I'll consider switching to it. I do require it to be cross-platform and look like a native application&amp;mdash;I'm writing business software, not toys&amp;mdash;which excludes JavaFX.
I always considered a hashmap as a dictionary. You have a set of unique keys which correspond to a certain object and thats it.
Somewhat more on the technical side: `HashMap&lt;Foo&gt;`'s `.add(Foo o)` works ([modulo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/modulo#Preposition) some basic sanity checking and book keeping) like this: use o.hashCode() to get an integer look up the "bucket" in the HashMap corresponding to that integer add o to that bucket So say you have a class `Foo` that overrides `hashCode()` to always just return 42 (a perfectly valid implementation that obeys the contract of `hashCode()`), then *all* objects of that class will go in the same bucket in a `HashMap&lt;Foo&gt;` and it will behave essentially like a bad implementation of a `LinkedList&lt;Foo&gt;`. Hardly optimal.
Wikipedia has an example using library checkouts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array#Example (HashMaps are a form of associative arrays)
Huh, I could've sworn I just received 1.5 million hits when I asked google about it. It's fine to ask for clarification, it's even okay to ask us to explain it completely but don't say stuff like 'Google isn't really returning anything.'.
Who are you writing desktop applications for and what do they do? Please elaborate, I'm very interested. Also, what is it about web applications that you dislike so much? Thanks! Interesting to hear you don't like JavaFX as well -- I used to do a lot of Swing, and took a glance at JavaFX tutorials but found it very strange.
Very interesting! Thanks for sharing. Can you elaborate on what your JavaFX/desktop applications do and who are they built for? Also -- maybe a stupid question -- where do you go to find "COTS" software packages? I mean, is there a community or something that builds reusable components or do you pretty much just stumble on software packages at trade shows and stuff like that? You say you bought one a few years back, which one did you buy? Thanks again! PS. You say you bought one a few years back, what did you buy and how did you happen to find it?
HashMaps should be used when you have predetermined keys that point to another object. Say you want to store some objects in memory by color, you could have a hashmap like this: map.put("green", new Array[]{frog, leaf}); map.put("red", new Array[]{fireTruck, sportsCar}); When you ask for the green objects with map.get("green"), you'll get an array with frog and leaf back. One of the features of HashMap is that it is very fast because you are essentially doing an array index lookup and not doing a brute force search for your key. At a very high level HashMap has a private array to store your object references. When you put objects into the HashMap it takes the key and converts that key to an integer via a hash function and stores your object reference in its internal array at the integer it generated for the key. In the color example above say "green" hashes to 125, then the HashMap stores the array reference with frog and leaf at hashMapInternalArray[125]. When you ask for something out of the HashMap, the key will be converted to an integer again and the HashMap returns the reference from the array at that index. e.g. say "green" hashes to 125 then return the reference in the internal array at 125. TLDR; Use hashmaps when you have a predetermined key to point to some object value and you want it to be fast.
He asked a simple question, why you mad bro? You say "it's even okay to ask us to explain it completely" when you didn't even answer the question in the first place. http://imgur.com/gallery/KiBQh 
Sorry if I'm misunderstanding your question, but a lambda is typically something you would pass to a method that operates on your whole iterable, letting you avoid writing the loop at all. So something like this might work: object.methodReturnsAStringIterator().forEach(s -&gt; doSomethingWith(s)); If you just want to loop succinctly on your method's return value, you can just do: for (String s : object.methodReturnsAStringIterator()) { ... } That wouldn't be a lambda, though. 
a hashmap is a collection of key-value pairs.
&gt;Who are you writing desktop applications for and what do they do? Please elaborate, I'm very interested. I don't want to reveal that, as it would be personally identifiable. I hope you can understand. &gt;Also, what is it about web applications that you dislike so much? * No constraint-based layout * JavaScript is an awful language * Cross-browser compatibility problems * They don't look like native applications * They don't act like native applications (e.g. can't save a damn file) * They can't be used offline * Severe restrictions on what the application is allowed to do The web was never meant to be an application platform, and it shows. &gt;Interesting to hear you don't like JavaFX as well Problems with JavaFX: * It's not truly cross-platform. There's no Linux version, and I don't think there's a Mac version, either. * It is (or at least was) not fully open source, and I don't trust Oracle not to abruptly terminate the project. * It doesn't look like a native application. Like I said, I'm writing business software, not toys.
That states that the right side of the : must be a sub-type of Iterable. Isn't that what I am returning with a lambda? I see a problem because Java doesn't know the lambda returns an Iterable. I was hoping that would be inferred. The way I was hoping it work: () -&gt; SomeIterator&lt;String&gt;() This would be interpreted as Iterable&lt;T&gt;, because that's what the enhanced for statement expects. Iterable is a functional interface and the only method, iterator, takes no arguments. So the above lambda would call Iterable.iterator() and an Iterator&lt;T&gt; would be returned. Obviously there is something wrong in my thinking, but I don't really see what.
You'd have to enclose the functorinitialisation with. Paras, and appenc .call()
Guava Splitter. Various parser generators like antlr.
It overwrites with the new value. Look here at the documentation of map: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put(K,%20V) Both hashtable and hashmap implement the map interface, but in java hashtable is an outdated implementation. You should always prefer hashmap to hashtable. Edit: After rereading your post (I'm on my phone) I will adjust and say that hashmap works just as the hashtable was explained in your algorithms class. All Objects in java have the equals and hashcode methods. But to correct you, not all hashcodes are unique. A hashtable is holding an array of linked lists. If two hashcodes are the same that hashcode will "point" to a linked list with two values.
Yes, most of world's non hobbyist applications are run on Java and the JVM.
There are more applications based on Java than I think you realize. Quite a lot of them are just behind the corporate wall or in academia. Just a small sample of some openly available and some not (all based on the Netbeans Platform) http://netbeans.org/features/platform/showcase.html
Ive been using JavaFX for some hobby projects for about 6 months now and so far it has been quite unwieldy. I originality wrote the whole thing in (albei crappy) proccesing. The reason i moved away from processing is an update destroyed all my work. So i decided to move on to a real language like java. Ive been trying to use the javaFX for its 3d features but most of them arent going to be supported until JDK8, which means lots of delays and migration of code. An example of this s that a norml HUD is not supported in JavaFX, to workaround this i had to make the application make a whole nother window over the first one, make the background transparent and overlay it on the first one. This makes me think that JavaFX dosent have a lot of features that are very important to the average software developer. So far my impressions of Javafx are : Usability:7 Efficiency:4 UI prettyness :4 Overall:6 Also if you have any more questions feel free to ask, i dont do this for a company so im free to share the details.
I work in Astronomy and we use Java for our user-level telescope control, target planning, queue planning, and employee scheduling. Java is common in astronomy. Here is one of the tools we use as a target map: [Aladin](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/) Everything we use is written in java 1.5 or 1.6 as a standalone application. There is a lot of plotting (JFreeChart) for data analysis and a lot of tables for looking at specific data points.
Well the JavaFX part for one is just wrong. * April 27. 2012 JavaFX 2.1 was the first official version with support for Macs. * August 14. 2012 2.2 was released and it has support for Linux. You can get more "native" feel with JavaFX than you can with Swing with less effort, given it's "skinnability" and people working on creating such skins (that are open source). But hey, I'm using Swing most of the time too because it's still the best option for Netbeans Platform based applications.
We are talking about UI. And no, not "most of the world application". I'm sure a large % is still running on AS2 serveur
It is a file cabinet. Sometimes you throw file folders (objects) in a file cabinet without taking the time to label anything. This is a List. You can go back and get the 5th folder (object) if you want. Sometimes you have a file cabinet where you actually label all the folders (objects) you put in there. This is a Map. You can go back and say, I want the folder (object) that is labeled (as a key) "bills". Sometimes they call this a collection of key/value pairs. The key is the label and the value is the folder (object). Map&lt;String,Date&gt; birthDays = new HashMap&lt;String,Date&gt;(); See those angel brackets above? The part that says String says what time of "thing" you will use for labels. Strings are pretty common for labels. The second part, Date, says what type of object goes in each folder. In that example you would have a file cabinet that specialized in storing only Date objects (values) underneath String labels (keys).
We're using GWT to build a CMS, among other things.
HashTable is synchronized while HashMap is not. So I would not say one shoudl always prefer one to the other. This can be a little confusing becuase you can certainly run into other multithreading issues but this discussion covers it pretty well. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40471/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable
We're using Java for a different number of projects. For the UI technology we mainly use JSF with PrimeFaces and OmniFaces. The apps are diverse. For example an internal lunch application was build using it (silly app that tracks who has to get lunch, what the inventory is, etc). Then we have a fraud detection tool, which analyzes transaction logs. It used to be a Swing desktop app, but we rebuild it as a server app with a JSF based UI. The public pages of our corporate site are also build using JSF, but these don't do a terrible lot. It's the basic templating to display content and some sign up forms. Further we have a management portal for our transaction code business. Here people can set goals, add rewards, items, look at statistics. This too is using JSF and since the UI can be quite complicated uses a lot of fancy PrimeFaces components.
Like the others, I'm new and this also interests me. The real question for me is "What are these mainly used for?" which I don't see a real answer to so far. I'm trying to think of this in my limited experiences and the only thing that comes to mind is something like instead of calling an object by its identifying value, you would call on it by it's hash[table/map] name. Is this a correct assumption?
The hashmap has a wide variety of uses but is usually used for a properties object that lets you store user or globall settings. It's also widely used for caching, since you can store things by name and check whether an object with a certain name already exists. Like, in game development for example, associate filenames with image objects
Perfect analogy since Delphi and Python call them dictionaries
To me it reads like a sentence in English. It basically says: Assign to _myTypesSearchResults a new list which should be populated by the list of search results returned by getting the first or default item where that item's key matches the string "MyTypeIdentifier". Then, cast each member of that list as MyTypeDto.
We're using [Grails](http://grails.org/) for all UI tasks nowadays. This thing does a lot of stuff right out of the box, and there is an endless amount of plugins for about everything... pretty impressed so far. Ok technically this is no longer Java as the primary language is Groovy, but you can seamlessly integrate plain old Java classes and the whole thing is based on Spring stuff and Hibernate. And Groovy is pretty cool, it removes so much boilerplate code compared to Java.
Take your C# and go back where you came from, this is a Java only sub, pal. JAVA RULES C# DROOLS!!! :D
Has anyone developed desktop applications using Eclipse RCP? What are your thoughts?
Look at the third or fourth response. That's what I meant. Hashtable is legacy code and there exist better alternatives no matter what you need. If you want concurrency for example you should use ConcurrentHashMap. 
Thanks. The last line gave me a perfect and understandable example as to how it would be used.
On the contrary, I often offer help on here. I'm not saying he shouldn't ask questions, I'm saying that his statement of 'Google isn't really returning anything' isn't correct. Please read what I wrote before you try to strangle me.
Google Web Toolkit. More specifically GWT-Bootstrap
Learn Python first
Parts of the Belgian government use Java Swing applications. (Well, at least one)
Not to mention it's a good practice to always perform if(toyChest.containsKey("ball")){ // get the value associated with the key here }else{ // do something else if the key does not exist } before trying to access a HashMap. You might not know whether the key exists, especially if you manage your keys and remove unused ones when they become worthless. This check simply makes sure you will never fall into a null pointer exception should the key not exist for some reason. If the code is non-trivial, then always go with the above style of accessing a HashMap.
I believe that the lambda syntax only works when there is a target type. By explicitly declaring a variable, you create a target type. You might try: for (String s : (Iterable&lt;String&gt;) () -&gt; object.methodReturnsAStringIterator()) { ... } **UPDATE: [info on target typing](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html#target-typing)**
Only issue -- if you want a slightly customized installer, it must be customized per IDE, not per distributable platform. That sucks, but is workable.
Don't learn Python first.
Much lower barrier to entry, cleaner syntax helps when new to coding, many more 'introduction to coding' style resources.
Presumably you get the number as a String from the user, so simply get its characters in an array (using [String.toChararray](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#toCharArray%28%29)), then each character in the array will be a digit which you can Integer.valueOf and manipulate accordingly. The alternative would be to Integer.valueOf the initial String, then work through [Math.pow](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#pow%28double,%20double%29)(10, i) to go through the digits with the first iteration, tens with the next, etc. Performance would be better for this approach, but the code will be less immediately readable. If you're still stuck after that, write down your pseudocode, figure out which part you're stuck at, and post what you've got so far and why it's not working. 
What's so bad about it?
Same here, along with SmartGWT to add a little pizazz.
Although it's not a class you're using other than as an example, you may want to update the site to reference StringBuilder rather than StringBuffer - the latter still has its uses in very specific circumstances, but the vast majority of the time StringBuilder is the way to go these days. It could also be an idea to mention the builder pattern as a way to simplify the creation of immutable objects with a large number of internal fields. One other suggestion is covering the idea of coupling static constructors with an immutable class - this can allow for caching of common instances of the class (e.g. in the way Integer.valueOf() behaves), with the performance and memory footprint advantages that this can bring.
The thing is, I really want to get out into the workplace and I feel that Java will be able to give me more opportunities in relation to jobs. I have a few contacts who argue that Java will make my resume the most competitive. Do you think this is correct? I am willing to put in the extra effort to learn Java if it means it will be more useful. 
Try /r/learnprogramming or /r/javahelp instead. We have too many of these posts in /r/java and too little actual content.
[Here](http://www.java-tips.org/java-se-tips/java.lang/linked-list-implementation-in-java.html) is one implementation of a linked list with lots of comments (I haven't read the entirety of the code). A tree is similar to a linked list, except that each node points to 2+ other nodes. Basically, a linked list is just an object with a pointer to another object. A tree is an object with pointers to multiple other objects.
I'm graduating in may after 5 years of studying software engineering and this is the easiest and most simple explanation I've ever seen. http://i.minus.com/ij48XuuJl7dgb.gif
You should check out [XChart](http://xeiam.com/xchart.jsp) for plotting. It's not as feature rich, but it's a hell of a lot easier to work with.
This is more of an explanation of what to expect from a random implementation of the Map interface; not the HashMap in particular.

I find that English sentence equally confusing for the same reason as the code; trying to pack too much into a single statement. I'll much rather read something structured into simple statements with obvious form and flow, both in English and in source code.
I've worked on a few projects developed using Eclipse RCP, it's really nice. These days I'm much more partial to NetBeans Platform though.
I disagree, not because Java is any more/less difficult than Python, but because I did it with ease and am by no means some kind of wizard. My first language was Java. I find the language more object-oriented (or rather, the programmer is more quickly introduced to object-oriented programming) than Python. However, one could really split Java into many different sectors with varying difficulties; primitives, inheritance, GUIs? The simple. ADSs and beyond (Java EE, commercial Android development)? The more complex. 
I'm disappointed that anyone would downvote this answer. The general consensus is that ConcurrentHashMap is superior for almost all the cases. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510632/whats-the-difference-between-concurrenthashmap-and-collections-synchronizedmap ^^^/holding ^^^back ^^^gripes ^^^over ^^^java's ^^^numerously ^^^bad ^^^legacy ^^^implementations ^^^//looking ^^^at ^^^you ^^^date/streams/threads
No, in Java the hash function is on the keys (`.hashCode()`), not on the Map implementation. So it depends on your keys whether you have a good hash function or not, and it's perfectly possible to have a bad hash function for your particular use case. For example if you're using Strings as keys, it's possible the particular keys you use often hash to the same values. Sun decided to not make hash functions pluggable per map instance, because they thought it would be too complicated for too little gain. Edit: Found the RFE: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4269596
Yes, but it's probably what was being asked. Similarly, I've come to expect that whan I say `List` (in a Java context), people will hear `LinkedList`, sad but true.
Think about when you use a list for example. You can stick any object in a list, like say a customer object which may hold details about a customer. You have a simple add method where you can add customers to a list and if you want to get one back you can call get(customer index). You can do the same thing with a map right? The keys can be integers and you can put them into the map with an integer key and customer value. You can then call get the same way. No gain here, why go through the trouble? Well what if customers want to give you some identification and ask for their information? You can use anything for the key, like their name perhaps? So you create an object called customerIdentifier that has a name, override hashcode and equals (most IDE's like eclipse can generate this for you) and use that as the key. The customer gives you his name and you return his info. Flash forward a week and people complain that they can't use the service because their name is taken (you were wise to not let duplicate customers have the same key). You do a facepalm and say of course, I'll just add a last name to the customer identifier object, let my IDE regenerate hashcode and equals, and without almost any work done the problem is solved. Please note that of course there are many things wrong with the above example that I'm not going to list here, but it was just to show you some power that a map can provide above a list.
awesome! just what i was looking for! i was not familiar with the terminology "tokenize a string." Thanks!
Honestly, my resume is empty and I have a lot of resources available to me with regards to coding. I am smart enough and am willing to work my ass off for as long as I need. 
First thought for me is ArrayList. 
In-house corporate banking software too. I guess it works best in specific domains. 
Do you know how difficult it is to construct a multi-platform application using RCP? I have heard it can be a pain, but I'm wondering how much of a pain it is.
Hi Snipersteve, thanks for showing an interest, I'll go into a bit more detail. Java application are most often found (in my experience) in the corporate / business world, as applications that were designed for and run within an organization. For example the recent one in JavaFX is a GUI front-end to an internal document imaging system we purchased. The existing front-end of that system was horrible, so I wrote my own, utilizing the same back-end. Typically Java is used by corporations who want to build their own internal software. Keeping in mind I'm a corporate drone, when I refer to COTS I'm talking about Commercial Off The Shelf software. Lets look back at that document imaging system I mentioned. Now, my group could have built one of these but we already had our hands full at the time, so we just bought one. We set it up and got the staff using it. We found some flaws we didn't like in the UI so that is when I wrote my own. We will probably eventually replace it with a custom build when we have the time. About how we found / bought... These kinds of software packages are common in a corporate/organizational environment. Some software companies specialize in document imaging software, others sell it as part of an add-on to other products they offer. All-in-all each situation is different and the amount to which we can modify each piece changes. For example IKON office solutions generally sells copiers and scanners, but are also getting into the document imaging software business. Side note: Their copiers now have a feature called "Java Card" which allows a programmer to build an interface on the touchscreen of the copier and catch documents (along with data entered at the screen stored in XML) on the back end through FTP / SMB / IMAP. We have lots of these copiers in each office. If or when we build our own, I'll likely be using these features.
Wow, not the scores I would expect. In terms of UI pertyness you know it has CSS support right? You can make it look like as awesome (or crappy) as you want it to. The default skin is actually not too shabby. Also Efficiency and Usability, I'm going to guess you haven't worked in too many "big kid" languages (for lack of a better term, sorry). JavaFX is actually the simplest and most efficient UI system I've used in some time. Try Swing out for example, its just one step back from JavaFX but you will feel the pain of listeners almost immediately. 
Swing is tricky. Lots of little hooks and pieces that can go wrong with no errors and you'll have no idea what the problem is until 3 hours later when you realize you forgot a listener to trigger an event. Also, no separate UI and code files a lot of times, so it ends up being a bit monolithic and difficult to maintain. Try-the-juice could probably be more specific, I haven't worked with it in awhile. 
We use SWT at work and are happy with it, though I don't work on that side of things.
Agreed. In the business / banking / trade world especially. If it is larger than a 10 minute duct-tape patch (which probably would have been in Python) and it was written after 2000, its almost always largely Java.
List and Map are interfaces. An interface is just a list of methods. Classes can implement interfaces by providing implementations for all of the methods in the interface. ArrayList is an implementation of List and HashMap is an implementation of Map, but these aren't the only implementations of those interfaces. In general, it's preferable to use the interface type over the implementation type when possible. This gives you more freedom to restructure things, if you, say, thread your code and need to wrap your HashMap in Collections.synchronizedMap or switch over to a ConcurrentHashMap.
HashMap is an implementation of Map, which is an interface. ArrayList and LinkedList are implementations of List, which is an interface. You will notice you cannot instantiate just a Map or just a List. LinkedList and ArrayList are used similarly, but differ in the speed of their operations. For example, adding elements to a LinkedList is always O(1), which is fast. Adding elements to an Arraylist can take up to O(N). However, getting some element of a LinkedList can take O(n) because each element must be compared, where an ArrayList get is always O(1). Lists have an _order_ and repeat values are allowed. Maps have no guaranteed order and duplicate keys are not allowed. Accessing a Map is done by presenting a key, and the value for that key is returned. Accessing a List is done by index. There are also speed differences between implementations. Something interesting to note is the more data data you are working with, or the more often you are accessing/searching/manipulating that data, the more these choices matter.. The smaller N is, the less significant the differences between these implementations is. I'm sure someone can elaborate, it's been a while since I used Java. 
Best way to learn about different data structures - according to myself! - is to implemend them yourself. That way you can clearly see what's going on when you add or remove elements for instance and elaborate on when you should use what. Most of them have their own niche and getting stuck with arraylist for example is probably not best practice.
The national weather services AWIPS II desktop application is built on top of Eclipse RCP. We primarily build for Linux but there are windows builds that we put out as well. It is very nice and working with SWT is great. The only part I'm not a fan of is trying to build the application using ant.
Ah, good. Progress. Guess I'd better give it another look. Thanks!
Maybe it has something to do with a deal oracle made a long time ago. I must agree that it kind of feels pretty retarded P&amp;R wise with developers to include it...
I will, thanks! JFreeChart is really annoying sometimes. It looks like XChart might not be as pretty though.

Why does this subreddit tolerate these kinds of posts? It takes seconds to find an answer on google. /r/javahelp and /r/learnprogramming is the proper place for these extremely basic questions.
Also, JOptionPane.showInputDialog returns a String, not a double, so that has to be parsed.
I work for a large retail company and we use Java on the desktop for our point of sale systems. We also have a web PoS system that uses JSF. The desktop client is old and blocky but I doubt we will ever get away from a SwingUI due to hardware interactions which can be difficult using the web with Javascript. 
Having worked with several other GUI libraries/frameworks in both of those languages I would be interested in hearing which one exactly you had used that you are basing your opinion on? 
The code generated by the Netbeans GUI builder is absolutely horrendous and inefficient... GroupLayout... ugh
Java for desktop user interfaces is much more commonplace than many people probably realize. Especially in the business and government realms. The cross platform capability of Java can be very beneficial.
Try Inkscape too. Best tutorial on the planet.
Checkout http://www.playframework.com/ for the web. If you're using Spring MVC for the web, look at http://www.thymeleaf.org/ 
Also, you never use the DecimalFormatter that you created, from what I see.
Thing about Lists and Maps.. they're implementations of interfaces. That means for List implementations like LinkedLists, ArrayLists and the like, you can use the same List methods on all implementations while each implementation has their own behind the scenes methods of executing the same functionality. Check out [this resource](http://www.coderfriendly.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/java_collections_v2.pdf) if you want to know the asymptomatic runtime of the various structures.
I'll give you an opposing viewpoint here... Java desktop apps are still used in MANY cases. My prime example is for application which need to be long-lived, off-line, and cross-platform. The company I work for wrote a monitoring application which could run in the system tray of any OS (Windows, Linux, Mac) using Swing. When the computer running it was on-line, it could report it data back to a central server. When the hosting computer was off-line, it would store the data until it could upload at a later time.
If you like GWT and can get the hang of Google Guice, check out Gin. GWT-P then adds some relatively sane defaults on top of Gin, by assuming certain things about presenters and views, and still allows you to write presenters (i.e. just logic code) that can run in a standard JVM (handy for fast unit tests, and in some cases sharing with Android or server code). The GXT 3.0 library gives you a fist-full of themeable widgets and some slightly saner data classes than the GWT HasData code, as well as cross browser plugin-free charting (full disclosure, I work on the GXT team). And MGWT lets you extend your widgets out to mobile devices - judicious use of MVP/C then lets you only write the core of the app once, with a mobile and desktop front-end.
Thanks, that is indeed the case. Because the foreach loop doesn't have a target type you need to typecast the lambda. I guess the problem here is that arrays are not objects and thus don't implement Iterable&lt;T&gt;. If the latter were the case foreach would have Iterable&lt;T&gt; as its target type and my initial code would work.
I've done webby stuff using Apache Wicket with some success.
I'd like to know so I can make one less flashy. This one looks terrible.
My GUIs look pretty bad too, using the default OS or Java styling. I want to be able to design an GUI in say photoshop and then code it in Java.
For starters, NetBeans built in GUI Builder is freaking fantastic. After that, it just comes down to re-skinning some stuff.
I think the newer versions stopped using it for some reason. That's why my Java teacher told us anyway. Looked pretty good when he showed it to us, wouldn't make sense to cancel it all the sudden.
You write your own look and feel. It isn't that hard to do, just start extending from the Basic*UI classes (BasicLabelUI for an example, which is the bare bone UI for a JLabel) and then use setUI() on your components. 
Why do you want a custom looking gui? I'd just like to point out the existence of http://swtswing.sourceforge.net/ which makes swing look much more native.
He probably just told you that so you wouldn't use it lol, it's still there! 
swings obsolete, use Java FX
It's nice to have some pre-built windowing tools. Jobs are nice if your GUI has to do a lot of number crunching or server accessing. If you run into problems building the GUI, you're on your own. I submitted a RCP bug to the Eclipse foundation that I found while building an RCP in Eclipse 3.5. 
I know! I'm starting to wonder if there's anything the man can't do or doesn't know.
For a desktop, I'm recomend you use Swing or JavaFX. Swing is more mature technology where weakest parts are well documented. Selecting a good webapp framework can cause headache. It's a lot of great tools on the market now (JEE6, Spirng, PlayFramowork, GWT, Vaadin). IMHO biggest problem is choose right tool for your job. Most of my web projects were made with [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com)
Don't do that. *containsKey* will be just as expensive as the *get* itself, so you're doing twice the work. Just make sure you check what *get* returns for being null.
Agreed it's horrible.
I'm part of a small development team that regularly updates and otherwise maintains a large Swing client application. This thing is *huge* - we have hundreds of custom views and models and if you were to sit down and browse through our trunk, you'd get overwhelmed very quickly. The Swing UI itself is still the main way to control our application, and offers everything from large-scale commercial/industrial diagram creation down to geographical mapping, and various types of logic processing. We've made a concious effort to split the application into client/server packages, so the UI code is actually quite well organised. I don't think we've considered JavaFX at all. Any new development work goes towards a web interface using frameworks such as [ZK](http://www.zkoss.org), or ends up being additional Swing work. 
You are serious about becoming a developer? Enroll at a college/university and get a degree.
You may also be interested in the book "Filthy Rich Clients" which, IIRC, goes on and on about what makes good/flashy Java UIs and how to do it. It s a few years old and won't cover JavaFX but was highly rated/wanted when it came out.
It's still there and it's better than ever
MiG Layout makes GUIs a lot easier in swing. I don't have much GUI experience but I think it's worth a look. http://www.miglayout.com/
Great points UnspeakableEvil. Indeed caching immutable objects are great idea. Thanks
But 95% of customers assume "well that's just how computers come", and the profits are worth pissing off the remaining 5%.
Making an attractive GUI is of course subjective. It won't show you how to write funky undecorated frames but JGoodies has several [presentations](http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/articles-and-presentations/) on good Swing design. In particular [First Aid for Swing UIs](http://www.jgoodies.com/download/presentations/first%20aid%20for%20swing-75min.pdf) has some general dos and don'ts which can help.
Last modified in 2007.
As clarification, I was not referring to the Netbeans GUI builder. I don't recommend using any GUI builder for Java Swing. I have never seen a good one. The Netbeans Platform is just that. A real GUI application platform. If you are not familiar, check here: http://netbeans.org/features/platform/features.html. VisualVM, the profiler application for the JDK, is one example that uses the Netbeans platform.
Have you looked into Qt? I haven't used it myself but it looks a lot more customizable. You can use HTML and CSS if you're familiar with them... Of not, you might want to learn, because CSS is a lot easier than any layout engine I've used.
I don't want to start an argument, as I don't really use either (I don't make desktop apps), but my understanding is that JavaFX _is_ the new GUI framework for Java applications. I know this doesn't obsolete swing, but to claim they don't serve the same purpose? Could you expand on why you believe this to be the case?
I don't know Java so I don't know what you're describing but your ability to write in English is better than some people I know. :)
+1 for Vaadin, easy to use, all JEE development
Not exactly sure what you need but String has several functions to get chars. : char firstChar = "myString".charAt(0); // Return a character (index 0 in example) from a string char[] asChars = "myString".toCharArray(); // Convert the string to a character array: These are just 2 examples. Edited for formatting.
Less is more
Maybe something like this? original = "Hello, World"; StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer(original); sb = sb.reverse(); String reverse = sb.toString(); return (original.equals(reverse)) ? true : false; damn I can't figure out how to format
If you start a line with 4 spaces, it'll use monotype space and make "code". You can also wrap it in backticks (\`). Like this: public class Test{ static{ System.out.println("Hallo Welt"); } }
Yeah, it's not attractive, but it was probably to show all the things you could do.
I don't really know how StringBuffers or their methods work, but surely line 5 can be simplified to return original.equals(reverse);
Yep, as dead as SWT itself.
Not sure why you're getting voted down for truth. Oracle has stated the same thing.
The basic principal is that you can draw swing components however you like. Instead of just using a native button control. This means any visual appearance is possible in a swing application. Although it does not mean that arbitrary behavior is possible.
JavinPaul, I'll look at your other java pages and use them as reference. I'm working on writing up an explanation of how classes work, but nothing as advanced as singleton, etc. See http://quarkphysics.ca/ICS4U1/unit2/classes.html By the way, you have two blog sites: javarevisited.blogspot.com and java67.blogspot.com . What's the difference between them? Finally, I notice in your writing that you tend to leave out small words (the, that, which, ...). Strangely, this doesn't affect the clarity of your writing. If you ever need something written for publication or a conference with correct grammar, I'd be happy to proof read and correct it for you.
You can do it without the StringBuffer by just comparing the first char to the last, the second to the second last, etc. Both solutions have issues with Unicode code points though.
Default is good, it's something people are already familiar with.
I am in college now for a useless degree and plan on later getting a degree when I expect I'll need one. 
As long as you have a good MVC boundaries, your front end UI in a web based application can pretty much leverage any web/javascript technology you please. At this point, I'm starting to work towards eschewing the traditional web request model all together, and simply serving up a rich javascript client via the web container, and then having clients make asynchronous calls to a REST webservice deployed on that same server. This gives you the ability to essentially package up your front end application as a standalone, to deploy to mobile devices, as well as work from the browser. I'm using the Enyo framework + phonegap for the frontend, and either glassfish or tomcat as the web container. http://enyojs.com/
A couple things I would like to see: * more details on this service, info is VERY light * will this work locally as well as on the web? I can't code review most of my work on a public website and I imagine many other devs cannot either. 
&gt; GUI in say photoshop and then code it in Java. Please please please don't do this. Well actually I don't care. Do whatever you want. But know that many people have chosen their desktop look and feel for a reason (preference or maybe visual disability) and their decision should be respected. 
That won't work. You are using a method reference, not a lambda. And the return type is Iterator, not Iterable.
Like others I agree this is pretty horrendous looking it shows some good concepts. The only problem is most users want apps that fit in with the rest of their experience and personally as long as I don't hugely lose out feature-wise I always go for native looks. Looks better, sleeker and more professional. [You can use SWT with Java to get native UIs](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) which is a better alternative to get your apps looking good everywhere - everyone who doesn't like the native look can install a visual style/theme and everything will look uniform and good.
I am using JSF and PrimeFaces for the front end of my Java web application.
Im using struts2 with twitter bootstrap on the client! Its smexy
Are you, by chance, taking the online software dev course from Oregon State University? I helped my friend who is taking that course solve this EXACT problem, and he was also only given Scanner for working with input. Interesting.
It really p*sses me off. It's the browser plugin gotdmmmt.
I'm guessing Oracle just doesn't give a flying fuck. This is a PR disaster, but PR has never been relevant to a company like Oracle.
Yeah. This is why I advocate removing the JRE entirely from machines I support. Most people just aren't going to have the chops to secure it and it's way too easily exploited. This is basically going to kill Java client-side through the browser though there's still plenty of room for Java desktop apps; especially ones that are precompiled with a built-in JRE.
Without seeing the code you're benchmarking, I'd be surprised if there's any concrete analysis people can give you.
Are you perhaps taking AP Computer Science? If so, I could show you my old course work. 
Sorry. Here is the url of the [repository](https://github.com/novasharper/PRIMES13).
I'm sure there's way more than a dozen of those too...
Holy shit, this. Every day it's basic question after basic question. It's semicolons missing, or people telling us they want to learn Java, and what are your best tutorials and books and IDEs, or `NullPointerException` on line 1246, or explain what i'm doing wrong in my dynamic PHP page: `onload="javascript:alert()"`, or `NoClassDefFoundError: Homework.class`, or ELI5 "interfaces", or what is a "HashMap", or "I'm going to a Java interview and don't know shit, how do i fake it?", or "My code doesn't work. I'm not going to show it though, except some irrelevant parts that aren't formatted correctly. What's wrong with it?", or "TIL how random number generators work!", or a post which is simply a direct quote out of the god damned homework assignment, with no added effort whatsoever. And the post title is usually a variation of "need help with JAVA plz". If this was Stackoverflow, these questions would be downvoted into the ground. Not sure why they're acceptable in /r/java, especially when /r/learnjava and /r/javahelp and /r/learnprogramming and Stackoverflow and even Google exist. What's even the point of /r/javahelp if these questions are acceptable in /r/java? At least /r/javahelp has a rule requiring proper post titles, and a FAQ! And if shit like this is acceptable in /r/java, what subreddit am i supposed to go to for the interesting stuff?
Even with the code it's difficult to relate it to your question. Also, I really can't work out how or if your timing is accurate? Timing threads is, difficult. // schedule stoping time (sets endTime) timer.schedule(new KillTasks(), runTimeApprox * 60000L)); // start iteration shouldRun = true; // mark start startTime = System.nanoTime() / 1000000L; // &lt;- wat! Maybe I'm missing something but isn't endTime determined by when you schedule the kill task? edit2: okay I see now... you're timing how many iterations you can complete in a set time Some other that here some general thoughts * try testing it more then once, you need an average * let the VM warmup classes should be loaded and the VM might need time to work out the hot spots to optimise * provide a min heap (Xms) and not just max, writing 'java -Xmx16G' is actually saying start with a heap size of 4Mb (or whatever is default but it's not large) but I want it expand to 16Gb when it's required (ouch) Unfortunately I don't think it will help with timing threads but [calpier](https://code.google.com/p/caliper/) takes the pain out of microbenchmarks. J edit: formatting/sp 
I will try using -Xms and caliper, but the problem appeared when we had a program that was basically just this. void doStuff(int a, Object o1, Object o2) { // Do nothing } Then, we just saw how many iterations we could get in in a certain amount of time. Where the arguments didn't vary between runs.
I get this weird feeling that this FUD is coming from somewhere. Someone wants to really hurt Java and I cant figure out why. There are very few sites in the wild that even use applets. Yeah the browser plugin has problems, but the way they keep attacking Java, it seems personal.
Even if you had the class files you would just have compiled byte code, you need the java files unless you use a decompiler. If you can't find the source files there are plenty of decent decompilers out there.
It's still not liking it. Thanks for the help though!
oh yeah I forgot to mention I had the decomplied version and even I didnt there was a way to do it. its not a big game but man it's really addicting. The biggest problem was the turn rotation when people fired at each other and other 90's java optimization issues. I dont know, i might just re write the whole thing over in something else
Try the watch window in firebug, enter a simple expression first, then expand, Also http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/ 
exploit a wordpress or joomla flaw, upload an applet to be served be the hacked site, and everyone going to that site might be affected.
If you want to learn Java, you probably don't want to start with an applet game written in the 90s.
i know but this game is my childhood dude! I wanna see the source for my favorite back in the day game. it'll be thrilling . cant believe im so thrilled about code. this is a good sign
I'm actually taking a java course at the university of southern maine, I did end up figuring out the issue, I didn't realize I could manipulate the string without actually converting it to a char type. 
Thank you very much for the help, I did end up figuring it out. The assignment was to check a string to see if it was a palindrome or not, one option was to reverse it and test it against the original, I chose to test each character with the corresponding character on the opposite end. Thanks again for the help!
I'm actually taking an intro java course at the university of southern maine, the program was supposed to read in an input and test to see if it was a palindrome.
Thank you so much for your help, I built off of your suggestion to finish the program, which was to read in a string and test to see if it was a palindrome. 
Were you able to get the class file and decompile it?
***Java is not JavaScript is not Java*** Try /r/javascript or /r/jquery 
I tried jquery first, but my phone wasn't having it. I just figured it didn't exist. Dumb phone. Thanks for the heads up.
Ask the developer very nicely. They'll probably say no anyway.
If it's in the same folder, you don't have to import it. If you do want to, you have to specify it on a class level, not method level. `import [[package]].[[subpackage]].[class]` is the structure you should follow.
Build it from scratch you'll learn more about it that way
Why would decompilation be illegal? I just decompiled a particular jar of Tomcat. Last week a decompiled my own compiled code even. Is the police now comming for me?
Do some reading on MicroBenchmarking - this is a good start: https://wikis.oracle.com/display/HotSpotInternals/MicroBenchmarks What you might be seeing here (if the method really does 'do nothing') is that the JIT is managing to completely optimize the call away after N runs with one param or one object param and a null param but is taking longer (or not doing it at all) with more parameters.
Well, you could just make 3 separate Jpanels and use different layout managers in east,center and west and then add the JButton components to those JPanels respectively. This is kind of nice sincce it isolates the components and means that you just have to layout these three JPanels initially and then tweak their contents. I'd probably use a BoxLayout with Y axis oritentation in east and west and then add JButtons to those. The middle one I'd use grid layout and add buttons to it. That means you can just tweak the sizes of these three panels using the various setPreferedDimension etc. methods. Here's two tutorials on &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html"&gt;GridLayout&lt;/a&gt;
I'd add three new JPanels to east, center and west and set the layout manager of each of these JPanels individually. In east and west I'd use boxlayout with a Y-axis orientation and you can then just add the JButtons to that. A quick tutorial: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/box.html For the middle one a gridlayout would be perfect: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html Play with it a bit and throw up any questions that come up.
looks like you can use the border layout for this bad boy. But its going to probs need a Panel in a border layout situation.. Atleast thats what id do. www.stewartdalton.com/oneWay.jpg have a look at this and this: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/border.html Stew 
There is defnitely value in understanding how imports work. But if you use eclipse IDE then you can click ctrl+shift+O and it automatically organizes your imports for you. Also if you are using a class for the first time it will highlight it in red for you and a quick fix ( ctrl + 1 ) will give you an option to import it. 
I haven't got time to look at the code but if you are doing performance/multithreaded testing then you might want to look at this framework someone posted up a week ago. http://blog.javabenchmark.org/2013/03/continuous-performance-and-junit-with.html

Using some of the things learned from that website, I basically came up with some code that looks like: double now = System.nanoTime(); double now2 = System.nanoTime(); double time = 1000000000; while(true){ now2 = System.nanoTime(); if(now2-now &gt; time){ placeholder++; System.out.println(placeholder); now = now2; } } It seems to be pretty consistent, however I tried coupling it with a program to draw rectangles, and every tick, I would make the rectangle move to the right, and that was all fine and good. The problem I have is that when I make the timer faster to update several times a second, it skips out on me and only animates the rectangle every few dozen frames. Is this the limit of these kinds of loops, or have I done something wrong?
Application server marketshare _of servers which have installed plumbr_
You should never be using while or for loops like this for animation. Better to use swing.Timer instead. You might have better luck asking this on stack overflow or javagaming.org
They don't need Java to do that. They just need to find someone running an older version of the popular web browsers. Most users are *not* up to date. I deal with this every day.
I guess that's true but these guys aren't the owners. The original owners just dont care - which means I cant have it. I was planning on making a better version using what they had but I guess i'll have to start from scratch
Certainly it's not *required* - JVM-in-browser is just another attack vector.
I dont know how to contact the real game owners. the current guys did what I'm trying to and that is they just modified the original. Dont think they wanna give it out
And Flash/Shockwave, Silverlight, etc. I'm just trying to point out that a browser plugin being a security vulnerability is not specific to Java's browser plugin. I'm frankly tired of all this Java vulnerability hype. Yes, these bugs need to be fixed. It's likely that they will, or that Oracle will deprecate the applet plugin (one can only dream), but these loud, ranty, holier-than-thou articles about the subject are just irritating.
i don't disagree that the loudness is annoying. If we ever go back to adopting this model of runtime-in-browser, it might do good to have better auto-updating processes or disabling processes built-in. I don't think Silverlight ever got enough traction to be as much of a threat as Flash and now Java. Biggest hit, really, imo, is that 'Java' itself is getting a bad name (not undeservedly from a Oracle-isn't-taking-this-serisouly standpoint). I've got some server-side Java projects and the clients are now freaking out a bit because they read 'Java has security holes' and I now have to describe the differences between server and client side (and re-educate on the difference between java and javascript sometimes too).
Yeah. The only reason people have Silverlight installed these days is for Netflix, and who doesn't use their smart tv/game console to stream netflix these days? I think that the runtime-in-browser idea is doomed to fail unless the vendors design and standardize a single secure interface between the plugin process and the browser process. However, who writes the standard? W3C? HAH. Given the rate of convergence on things like Javascript, I doubt that will *ever* happen.
I've never used web-based netflix ever. :/ FWIW, I'd like to see javascript moved in to a browser-based plugin, so we could see more improvements in js engines without requiring entire upgrades to the browser - perhaps even competing js engines (or... multiple concurrent - http headers or tags could indicate which js engine should be used, if present).
Ahh, I see. Weird, either these programs share curriculum, or there's a bizarre coincidence going on. Anyway, did you figure out how to do it within the guidelines of the assignment?
`import test.Sort` would import a class named `Sort` inside a package named `test`. Next time you have basic java questions, go to /r/javahelp 
Learn the GridBagLayout. It is a complex layout manager but very flexible. Once you understand it, it will make laying out components very easy. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html
You need a lesson on the Event Dispatch Thread and Swing Timers. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html
That might be interesting. Especially if it weren't JavaScript-centric. The hard part is going to be ensuring that your users have the right plugins to run a particular page, which isn't very different from the way it works right now. This'll have to be managed by a plugin-neutral party, probably the browser vendor.
I'd love feedback on both how accurate and how learner-friendly this article is. I've only been looking into Java for a few days so I'm concerned I've made some errors. Also, while I writing I threw in a bunch of stuff to keep myself from getting bored, but I hope it doesn't get in the way of actually learning from the article.
Tomcat is a web server/container. It is not an application server. You'd need at least TomEE if you wanted an application server. This is like having a survey of the most popular luxury cars but including a Honda Civic on the list and then being surprised that more people own a Civic than a Ferrari.
Could you direct me to a succinct Sun style guide?

 if(myString.contains(" ")){ return myString.substring(0, myString.indexOf(" ")); } Basically you first check whether the string contains a space. If it does, it will take a slice from that string, starting from index 0 (the start) untill the index of the first space.
 public String firstWordIn(String s){ String [] aString = s.split(" "); return aString[0]; }

I don't know why you'd need plumr if you were running weblogic. They provide tools to find any leak. This seems like a silly "analysis"
 String newString = ""; for(int i = 0; i &lt; myString.Length(); i++) { if(myString.charAt(i)== ' ') newString = myString.substring(0, i); else continue; }
love you
Thanks
This is wrong you don't need the else, and you should have a break. Also it's marginally quicker to check the char array if you care about performance. String newString = ""; char[] charArray = myString.toCharArray(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; charArray.length; i++) { if (' ' == charArray[i]) { newString = myString.subString(0, i); break; } } But yeah /u/itsgreater9000 covered the gist of it
toCharArray() creates a new array copy which may be slower than charAt calls :)
How does charAt() work though, I'd assume that has to convert the String literal to a char array anyway, and you are making that call once per character?
Come to think of it, maybe .indexOf(' ') is actually the quickest way, you don't even need a for loop then: String newString = ""; int firstSpace = myString.indexOf(' '); if (firstSpace &gt; 0) { newString = myString.substring(0, firstSpace); }
Why do you need an applet? Use Swing.
For someone's homework assignment I doubt they'd particularly care about performance, less so if they're looking for people to give them the answer.
No idea why you've been downvoted (unless it's someone annoyed that the OP's had their homework for them); as far as I can see the only thing this is missing is a check that s isn't null (which isn't required anyway based on the initial conditions specified), and as String.split() returns the original string if the supplied regex isn't matched - i.e. the behaviour is exactly what's required.
I don't know why. I used an applet because the key listener tutorial I watched used an applet, and I don't know what I'm doing. I'll look into swing. A lot of my shortcoming are coming from me not knowing what it is that I don't know, if that makes sense... 
There is only so much you can do, if you don't have moderators who actively participate. The key might be to target the people answering others' homework questions by archiving the material and identifying aspects against the day when it might be useful in a character investigation in the workplace or academic setting.
If you are a beginner, I highly recommend getting the book [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596009208&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cswo09-20) and reading until Chapter 13. You will master the fundamentals as well as learning Graphics and Swing.
Java itself is dumb, can't do anything. It looks like it is just using windows file permissions. Right click on the file. Go to properties, and then security. If your user account isn't listed there with read/write... add yourself.
I decompiled it. This is the lock command it is doing from a command prompt. cmd /c attrib +h +a +r &lt;filename&gt; cmd /c cacls &lt;file name&gt; /e /c /p &lt;current username&gt;:n To unlock, it looks like it does this cmd /c cacls &lt;filename&gt; /e /c /p &lt;username&gt;:f cmd /c attrib -h -a -r &lt;filename&gt; It puts stuff in your registry thusly: cmd /c REG add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer /v Nosecuritytab /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f REG add HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System /v DisableCMD /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f The actual password file itself.. appears to be in the current directory in a folder called "data" in a file called "password.exe". Try opening this file with notepad..
Unfortunately, I don't understand any of that. I've taken two classes on Java and I've never been able to understand it. ): I opened it and it shows my password. Pretty straightforward on that. What do I do now? o_o
It has nothing to do with Java. None of the things it does, it actually does in Java. It could be written in any language, because it doesn't do anything in Java, instead all it does is call some windows programs named [`cacls`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacls) and [`attrib`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATTRIB) to do the actual work.
Ok, but based on the programming, shouldn't we be able to figure out what it's doing and in turn determine how to resolve it?
What...? /u/TunaBoo just did. He even gave you the commands the program uses to unlock. Run those commands without the program. I have no clue what that registry crap is about though.
Ok, then I guess you didn't read my reply. I don't understand any of it. I need help (read: be told) what to do. If I understood java, I could probably have figured it out on my own, but I don't; and even though I did what he said about granting me permission for the file, it's still giving me an error and saying that I don't have permission.
Ok, I will. Much appreciated.
For one, you seem to be missing some brackets. Does this program compile? Once you get it to compile, what is the while loop doing for you? Maybe you don't need both of those loops? Finally, "limit" should be greater than or equal to the final number that you calculate in the sequence. Looking at your "for" loop, you're instead using limit as the number of times to run the loop. I'm not the greatest teacher, but maybe you should think through (or even write down on paper) what each iteration of your loops are doing. Look at the values of f0 and f1 at each iteration and figure out what you can do to ensure the program outputs the correct values.
Why a final int temp? It seems like you want some sort of method can print the first n fibonacci numbers up to some limit. This is kind of hacked up, but what about something like: public void printFibs(int someLimit) { int a = 1; int b = 1; while (b &lt; someLimit) { //do stuff } } Also, please indent after an open bracket :)
I don't have the jpb library, and I also don't know what SimpleIO is, so I can't compile this. However, assuming this performs as is implied by your code, the loop is running without user input. Does it compile, ask for an input, run, and then stop (albeit printing out the wrong numbers)? If so, think about what a "for" loop does. It usually starts at a number (which you've given as zero) and runs a number of iterations until conditions have been met (you've stipulated the loop should run "limit"-number of times). You actually don't want it to run "limit"-number of times. You want it to run until "f1" is &gt;= "limit". EDIT: Looking at a comment below, it does seem that it should be f0 &gt;= limit rather than f1 &gt;= limit as I mentioned above. I'm a little tired, so forgive me if I'm wrong on some of the particulars.
That's great, but it's a bit like doing the homework for someone without teaching them anything (without asking for $50?! what?! there's money to be made here!).
Fair point - I edited out the content. The point was to encourage extracting a method :)
Your for loop runs the number of iterations that they specified (i &lt; limit) instead of terminating when f0 reaches their limit (f0 &lt;= limit). It would definitely be better served by a while loop.
Fair point as well. Although, I think OP should wrap his/her head around the basics before exploring something more complicated (even if it seems extremely simple to us).
There is a problem with your while loop. after the boolean condition (i &lt; limit), it will run whatever code is there in loops, usualy everything that needs to be looped is either inside brackets like { multiple lines of code }, or if it is a single line, it stops at the first ; your code runs like the latter, the loop just sees the " if int i = 0;" and then the loop is over. you need to invelop your Fibonacci code is {} so it will run again and again.
So, the thing is that you are initializing f0 and f1 to numbers. You want to check that your highest fibonacci number is still &lt; the limit. So not "while (i &lt; limit)", but "while (f1 &lt; limit)" is a starting point here... Don't worry so much about the traditional for-loop structure. This is, as others have said, a good spot to use a while-loop. And please remove the 'final' from that int - you are overwriting it with every cycle through the loop. And please please indent properly :) you might want to look at IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse - they can help a lot with compilation issues. What OS are you using for this? What editor?
Not sure what's up with your lack of brackets. What you have there only has the println in the while loop. Everything else is outside of the loop.
So, inside a while-loop, if you set a condition like "while (x &lt; 100)", unless you increment the value of x inside that loop, you'll just spin cycles forever. You want your reassigning-of-values logic to ALSO be inside the while loop.
I agree. Knee-jerk reactions die hard lol.
So, here is an example of a loop that will print numbers from 1 to 100: public void printNumbers() { int i = 1; while(i &lt;= 100) { System.out.println(i); i++; // each pass through the loop, i increase in value by 1 } // the while loop ends here! } What you're doing is closer to this: public void printOneForever() { int i = 1; while(i &lt;= 100) { System.out.println(i); } // the while loop ends here! i++; // this never executes inside the while loop! so the value is always 1 } When you say "while(something-or-other)", your program will live inside that "while" until the something-or-other becomes false. So the logic that alters the numeric values of your variables must also be inside the while loop, or else you'll just sit there forever - computers aren't this smart yet :)
The Applet's addKeyListener method isn't part of the Applet itself, but the Component class that it inherits. All Swing controls inherit this as well, so your key listener tutorial should apply universally. Go find yourself a tutorial on using JFrame. You could start [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html). Most if not of what you can do to an applet can be done to a JFrame as well.
the thread suggested to you should work. also, this seems like it might work: private boolean run = true; //keeps loop running //your init method public void init(){ //makes run = false this.addKillSwitch(this); //don't need this //this.addKeyListener(this); //If names aren't hardcoded in, get them when the program is run if (redName == null){ redName = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter the red corner fighter's name."); blueName = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter the blue corner fighter's name."); } while(run){ //print your stuff //sleep for 1 second } }
I'm not sure this works. It seems like it doesn't do anything if the init() never completes
Nah. We on Stack Overflow keep sending these folks to Reddit. No one just asks a question anymore. What they want is free lessons in Swing to get through some course.
LOL true.
NetBeans. I feels a lot more noob-friendly, in my opinion.
It won't help you now, but once you get to the "real" programming world, there are utilities to handle this sort of thing. Commons-Lang's StringUtils package comes to mind immediately: String myString = StringUtils.reverse(original); Why do I even mention it? Just to give encouragement that it gets better. :)
It may have been the case that they were lacking in the past but mission control has never failed me (neither has VisualVM). It gets tricky if you're in jni land but even then I've never needed a third party tool. Worst case with jni is having to do a heap dump and grep for global native references. 
Does that make sense? This program does nothing except call out to some windows program to do some simple file permission type things. You just need to do those things as an admin entitled command prompt, and you can unlock the file...
Yes and no. No because I don't know how to do the command prompt unlock, or perhaps rather I don't particularly understand it. I need to open the command prompt then type in exactly this? Nothing else? cmd /c cacls &lt;filename&gt; /e /c /p &lt;username&gt;:f cmd /c attrib -h -a -r &lt;filename&gt;
I haven't used the annotations stuff, so I don't know how easy it'd be for you to make this change, but how about implementing your own UserType that works as a UUID on HQL and GUID on SQLServer?
You are almost there, but you are missing a couple of things. I've made this barebones example for you which you can use as a start. It's simple once you understand it, so take your time playing around with it. Good luck! public class SampleGame { private static final double GAME_SPEED = 30.0; private static final int SECOND = 1000000000; private static final double GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL = SECOND / GAME_SPEED; private float rectX, rectY, lastRectX, lastRectY; public static void main(String[] args) { SampleGame game = new SampleGame(); game.loop(); } private void loop() { double lastUpdateTime = System.nanoTime(); while (true) { // update your rectangle positions based on your game speed double now = System.nanoTime(); while (now - lastUpdateTime &gt; GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL) { updateGameLogic(); lastUpdateTime += GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL; } // draw your rectangles independently of your game speed float delta = Math.min(1.0f, (float) ((now - lastUpdateTime) / GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL)); drawRectangles(delta); try { // sleep a bit so your processor doesn't go crazy Thread.sleep(10l); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // ignore } } } private void updateGameLogic() { // you have to store your old positions lastRectX = rectX; lastRectY = rectY; // update your rectangle position logic here rectX += 50; rectY += 0; } private void drawRectangles(float delta) { // this is the clever bit that makes your rectangle move smoothly int newXPosition = (int) ((rectX - lastRectX) * delta + lastRectX); int newYPosition = (int) ((rectY - lastRectY) * delta + lastRectY); // your drawing logic here... // drawRect(newXPosition, newYPosition, 50, 50); } } 
Yeah that seems quite useful. I wonder how it will know which implementation is in use though. I would have to provide a way to look this up
In fact, if you're wanting to do it globally for a type then extending either the HSQL or SQLServer dialect to remap the type might be a cleaner way - take a look at registerColumnType()
Take a pen to paper and draw them out. Also draw out the steps perform actions like deleting a link in the middle of the list. 
Are you talking about LinkedLists in general or talking about some specific class? Basically, if it's your own class it's just one set of data, and a link to the next item in the list.
I've not done any hibernate in years so I'll have a look into it. Thanks for the advice.
The subreddit you are looking for is /r/javahelp, this subreddit is not for learning, but for discussing. You should also post the code with the question. The answer is that each tile should be an Object, with properties such as isMine, isFlagged and isClicked, the second one should turn to true when clicked. Your toString method or draw method should use the logic in isClicked to determine whether or not to show it. if( isClicked) { if ( isMine) { // Explosion, or losing action } else if (isFlagged) { // show flagged } else { // Show empty square } else { // show unclicked square }
Precisely this. Sometimes you want to depend on a static method call in order to perform some internal logic, and you want to test what happens when that static class has different outputs. It's not really a _problem_ for mocking. Its refactor path toward unit testing is relatively simple if there are few enough static calls. Simply create a Utils bean with an interface and add it as a dependency to the class. This makes the dependency explicit, and it also makes it so you can test the I/O of the dependency without having to have a real copy of the dependency. If multiple classes have the same static dependency, you can use the same class for it as well instead. This leads to you not testing the static method itself, but that should not be your goal in unit testing anyway, and you can easily test the static method's behavior in another unit test (as the OP suggested). So: SomeStaticUtil.calculateSomeValue(a,b); Simply becomes: instanceOfInterfacePointingToSomeStaticUtil.calculateSomeValue(a,b); And then you simply give it different mocks for that instance. (You probably knew all of this, but hopefully someone finds it helpful). Dependencies on static methods are somewhat difficult to unit test in Java, but everything can be solved by yet another indirection. ;)
did you happen to previously set the path of java in eclipse.ini to your old installation? EDIT: posting the exact error was be most helpful...
I did not change the ini until I tried to fix the error, but all I did was add the -vm argument with the path, and then remove it when it did not work. The errors- "A java runtime environment(JRE) or java development kit (JDK) must be available in order to run eclipse. No java virtual machine was found after searching the folowing locations: C:\eclipse\jre\bin\javaw.exe java.exe in your current PATH" And if I fix that error I get: "Failed to load the JNI (might be JNL can't tell) shared library "C:\eclipse\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll"" For this error I have the jvm.dll file and I copied the jre folder from 1.6 jdk.
Python has a few advantages over Java as being a batter first language: - You are not force into OO from day 1 like you are with Java. When you are learning to program, you should worry about learning simple constructions like loops, conditions, basic data type, simple algorithms, and minmal I/O. "Why am I marking this method as 'static' and wrapping it in a class to write 'hello world' to the screen? When I call System.out.println() am I calling a static method, a normal method on an instance of an object assigned to a static var? Is that all somehow package namespacing?" These are all fine questions, but ones you generally don't want to deal with your first week of learning programming. Sure you can just type the 'magic incantation' that makes the program work, but what's the fun of learning if you don't understand what you're typing? - Python has a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) which makes testing code super easy. With java, you gota do the write/compile/run cycle to see what happens. - The syntax of Python is generally cleaner in that it doesn't derive from a language developed in the 70s. Who needs all them silly curly braces and semicolons? With that said, you could do worse than Java as a first language. Mine was C... ugh.
Wow. Thanks for the elaborate response. What types of applications are examples of those that run with python?
If you mean what kinds of applications have been written in Python, pretty much every kind you can think of, though I think the language is most popular as a backend web programming language (Reddit is written in python for instance) and scientific computing. It's also a popular scripting language for sys admins as a replacement for Perl scripts. That's just been my general experience though. Python's website probably has better info than I can provide off the top of my head: http://www.python.org/about/apps/ http://www.python.org/about/success/
Since you've got the vm path added to the ini file, the only other thing I can think to tell you is to quadruple-check that both your jdk and eclipse are both 64bit. Definitely update the thread if you discover a fix. I'm sure it'll come back to help someone and i'd love to see what the problem was.
I am sure it is 64 bit. The only thing that I did was added a path variable when setting op that minecraft code thing. It overwrote the variable path, which I guess it is not case-sensitive. I think path used to be pointing at with vm in the name. I have an old backup of this computer I try booting to check what it was pointing at. Otherwise Nothing has changed. I also have a copy of eclipse on a portable drive that gets the same errors. I will post what was wrong after I figure it out, [relevant](http://xkcd.com/979/).
Could you post your PATH variable, the results of the commands 'where java' and 'java -version', and your eclipse.ini file? I think that something is wrong your PATH variable.

If it is the only item, I highly recommend a system restore to get the values back. &gt; Where java didn't work in command prompt, I have never used that. The where command should have worked, see above. &gt; I have also tried the value with quotes around it, because some one said if it has a space it needs quotes not sure if true.

I appreciate the encouragement, I am a computer science minor, so I don't know how much programming I will be doing, but I am greatly enjoying my CS classes. 
Yup, here is my program. import java.util.Scanner; public class prog6part1 { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println("Enter your palindrome: "); String s=console.nextLine().toLowerCase(); String r = ""; String a = ""; if(s.length() == 0){ System.out.println("Invalid Entry!"); System.exit(0); } while (s.length()&gt;0){ r=r+s; s=console.nextLine().toLowerCase(); } for(int j = 0; j &lt;= r.length()-1; j++){ if(Character.isLetter(r.charAt(j))){ a = a + (r.charAt(j)); } continue; } for(int i = 0; i &lt;= ((a.length())/2); i++){ if(a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(a.length()-(i+1))) { continue; } else{ System.out.println("\"" + a + "\" is not palindrome."); System.exit(0); } } System.out.println("\"" + a + "\" is a palindrome."); } }
Java, yes, eclipse, no.
You badge-hunters are kind of starting to pollute this sub...
What's a badge hunter?
There are many other variables with the string "path" in them, but that was the only one that was just "PATH". I am working on getting a backup of this computer running to see what was in that variable. It is also windows 8, if that makes a difference. Turns out command prompt was not pointed at system32 by default. here is the where java results: C:\Windows\System32&gt;where java C:\Windows\System32\java.exe C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe Adding the vm parameter to eclipse.ini solved not being able to find the jre as did setting the path variable to the jre.

I didn't think about it but your question sparked interest. I couldn't find any *good* reason but here are two subjective ones that seem common: - Because they can (aesthetic). According to [WCAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast), any contrast higher than 4.5:1 is ok. - Black on white is "too hard" on the eyes, something I personally would take issue with until "proven". Black on white is of course meating the 4.5:1 minimum by having quite a bit higher contrast.
&gt; import [[package]].**[[subpackage]]**.[class] I would nitpick on this. The concept of subpackage does not exist. This is one of the banes of having package names coincide with directory structure as a convention. People start thinking of packages as a hierarchy - it has no hierarchy. It's flat. The reason I nitpick is because if you write import javax.swing.* The compiler will only import classes in the package javax.swing. It will not import classes from any other package - because the compiler does not treat packages as hierarchical. In short, javax.net is not related to javax.net.ssl any more than it is to javax.swing. Think about it. If they were more related, wouldn't their common ancestor "javax" make "net" and "swing" more related than java.awt and swing?
JSF is a component framework, that is all. The "relevance" of JSF is in the component libraries that integrate the new hotness with back-end business logic. As long as component libraries are developed that wrap Javascript/AJAX/HTML5, then JSF will remain relevant. The nice thing about JSF is that by creating a standardized common component framework, when the new hotness changes and there is a component library wrapping it, you can change component libraries while maintaining the business logic (ideally). JSPs are obsolete because there really are better ways of solving that problem.
You don't really need JSP for that. You can deliver the initial content using static HTML and use web services like JAX-RS to integrate with client-side Javascript component libraries. JSF kind of sucked at the beginning, but it seems to have taken off quite a bit now after JSF 2. Especially *because of* RIA, since JSF wraps up the details of server-side to client-side Javascript component integration. Seems like a lot of Java developers really don't want to touch Javascript.
You'd have better luck in /r/javahelp for this kind of question. But, since I'm bothering typing this comment, this is the problem: if(name != "Josh") { should be: if(!name.equals("Josh")) { The reason for this is that == (and !=) test reference values for non-primitive types (like Strings), while `equals` compares actual values. So, the "memory location" referred to by `name` is not the same "memory location" where the string "Josh" is located, so != is `true` and you'll hit line 16 every time. You want to test that name has the same characters as the string "Josh", so you have to use `equals`.
Thanks
you can also use !name.equalsIgnoreCase("Josh") 
Agreed, you don't NEED JSP for that... but if you're a Java shop already then it fits in nicely. For example, at my company, we do a lot of preload data lookups for things like security roles and cacheable data that need to be available in JavaScript... there's really not a lot of justification for a secondary request after the initial page load to get that info when it's easy enough to do in a JSP and render some dynamic JS variables as needed. It's not The One Solution To Rule Them All(tm) or anything like that, but it's not a bad approach either in some cases. 
Perhaps they believe it saves on ink.
What do you think JSF renders as?
&gt;Frankly, I think JSF has been dying off for a couple of years now. That's been my experience anyway. I don't know many people using it, and none that I know who do like it very much. I know I swore it off years ago :) Then you should work a bit more with Fortune 500 companies. We get lots of consultancy projects with them JSF based. Which is a misfortune since JSF is a pain to work with, but given my experience developing a JSF framework I tend to get some of this offers. :(
Windows 8? I doubt it, but I have no experience with it. Well, system32 is supposed to be on your path. The only thing that I know of to do is to reinstall Eclipse like mcbarron suggested. I guess sometimes the configuration of Eclipse gets bugged. Otherwise, I don't really have any ideas on what happened.
&gt;Which is a misfortune since JSF is a pain to work with Why?
You're asking two questions: 1. Are server side frameworks dying out? 2. Is JSF and JSP passe? As for the first question, there has been some hype for a while now about doing everything client side. But such hypes themselves come and go too. Read this for some background: http://johnwaterwood.wordpress.com/2011/08/13/the-remote-local-computing-cycle Twitter is a famous example, when RoR was the big hype, they went with RoR. Then doing everything client side became cool, so they did. But then the performance wasn't that great, and they went back to server side again. As for JSF specifically, this may be a bit dry but interesting read: [Extending web frameworks to support HTML5 technologies – The case of JavaServer Faces](http://jdevelopment.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/07/markvandertol_thesis3.pdf) I don't think JSF will die out at all. On the contrary, it's still picking up momentum and is getting better with every release. Earlier versions had issues (no sane templating, little or no support for GET, weird navigation rules, tedious way to create custom components, no stateless support), but this has all been fixed by the later versions and as such it's now really easy, cool and productive framework. As for JSP, I hope it will die out, but it will be with us for some time I think. It offers a kind of secondary approach within Java EE to do web templating; html code with Java code in blocks intertwined with it (it's the same approach as PHP). I don't really like it. 
As a guess Fortune 500 companies may be slower to upgrade technologies, and so pjmlp is having to work with JSF 1.x rather than 2.x. If that's the case it's hard to argue with the assessment - it's the way most of these JSF threads go, people who are still using 1.x view JSF as a pain, and are encouraged by the 2.x users to switch to that to ease the vast majority of their problems. If that's not the case though, then I too would like to know why he views JSF as a pain.
It's also safer to put the fixed string as the first argument, just in case "name" is null (not sure how it'd happen in this example mind you): !("Josh".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
No I, don't think JSF is dying. It never got the traction it demanded. And that's for two reasons: * It is too expensive (time and / or effort) to maintain component stacks. Like any other framework, it is hard to change fundamental things without breaking backward compatibility. And it takes more time and effort to create new components that have to prove themselves to be reusable. If a website (((yes, JSF can have other presentations - show me more than one or two products))) is changing fast, it may be impossible to maintain the component stack along those changes. That becomes a bigger issue, when your development team works in an agile environment. * Server-side presentation state is becoming a bad practice. If you want to build a scalable (RESTful) application, it needs to have as many stateless components as possible. And managing the presentation state should never be a core problem of an application. And yes, in JSF you can keep the state on the client-side. But that requires a validation of the component stack at the server for each request - which is a waste of resources, too. JSF is a good thing for building standard UIs, like business forms. And it can be used in a MDA environment. But I do not see advantages in maintaining a component stack for specialized frontends which must be changeable within the development cycles of agile projects.
What is this a quiz? Do you feel cool now? Of course JSF is built on JSP which is built on Servlets. What's your point?
JSP's can be (and are) used like PHP like you mention, but lately what I've been doing is using JSP's as an easier way to make a servlet that just does the data back and forth. Instead of generating HTML, my JSPs generate JSON or XML as needed. By doing this I eliminate most of the need to have a separate tree of Java source files that compile into a WEB-INF/classes directory. 
I find it hard to read and normally don't bother. Black on white is what books and newspapers are. If they are grey on white people would think that something is wrong with the printing. Perhaps it's different because screens actually emit light. I do have Javascripts that work as bookmarks that normally work (depending on the page's CSS): This one makes the background black: javascript:(function(){var%20newSS,%20styles='*%20{%20background:%20black%20!%20important;%20color:%20yellow%20!important%20}%20:link,%20:link%20*%20{%20color:%20#00EEFF%20!important%20}%20:visited,%20:visited%20*%20{%20color:%20#66FF66%20!important%20}';%20if(document.createStyleSheet)%20{%20document.createStyleSheet(%22javascript:'%22+styles+%22'%22);%20}%20else%20{%20newSS=document.createElement('link');%20newSS.rel='stylesheet';%20newSS.href='data:text/css,'+escape(styles);%20document.getElementsByTagName(%22head%22)[0].appendChild(newSS);%20}%20})();
Of course. Java's write once philosophy is very threatening to any entity promoting a particular platform. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Sony, the Linux community, etc... etc... They all want exclusivity - they all want software to be written for their platforms and not the other ones. Keep this in mind when you read shill blogs like this.
I'mma going to back you up. Haven't seen much JSF out there in the real world at all. It's still a jsp / Spring MVC dominated market and it works awesome for JSON / RESTful at the same time. Max flexibility. Thymeleaf looks promising as a jsp successor if you dont' want to go full-on JavaScript client-side. http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=jsp,%20jsf http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=jsp%2C+jsf&amp;l= 
JSP will work with JSF but Facelets are recommended.
That's really a terrible approach to use because you'll have a load of unnecessary round trips, break the back button and and SEO. It definitely has its uses, but not as a default approach. 
That is a problem in general with RIA. But, the pure document model of the "old web" may be fast becoming obsolete as users demand more interactive experiences.
&gt;Of course JSF is built on JSP If it's a quiz, then "Buzzzzz! Wrong!" :P JSF is NOT build on JSP. Instead, JSP is one of the two VDLs (view description language, aka templating engine) that is supported by default. But supported is with a grain of salt, since it's only supported for the sake of legacy and it's status is set to deprecated. The current and primary VDL of JSF is Facelets. There are a tiny amount of Facelets assumptions in JSF core, but also in the case of Facelets you can't say JSF is build on Facelets. Instead, one can *use* Facelets to compose the UI.
&gt;It's still a jsp / Spring MVC dominated market None of the Java web frameworks dominate! It's a *very* fragmented market. Each fan thinks that his favorite framework dominates, because in their day to day work that's all they see. Heck, even Wicket fans think that their framework is dominant (which isn't true of course, not even by a long shot). Specifically with respect to JSF I collected some numbers here a while ago: http://henk53.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/reply-to-comparing-java-web-frameworks Indeed.com with some more frameworks: indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java+jsf%2C+java+tapestry%2C+java+gwt%2C+java+%22spring+mvc%22%2C+java+play%2C+java+vaadin%2C+primefaces%2C+richfaces&amp;l= Indeed.com relatively: http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java+jsf%2C+java+tapestry%2C+java+gwt%2C+java+%22spring+mvc%22%2C+java+play%2C+java+vaadin%2C+primefaces%2C+richfaces&amp;l=&amp;relative=1 Of those NONE is really dominant. I left one framework out, and that's the venerable *Struts*. If we add that one to the mix, we see it's still the only one that's sort of dominant (it used to be -the- defacto framework in a time when a lot of new software was build, and there wasn't really anything else): http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java+struts%2C+java+jsf%2C+java+tapestry%2C+java+gwt%2C+java+%22spring+mvc%22%2C+java+play%2C+java+vaadin%2C+primefaces%2C+richfaces&amp;l= Of course *we* don't really want to admit this, since Struts is about the least cool framework our there, but it IS still out there although it's dominance is declining. Whatever way you look at whatever numbers, Spring MVC is NOT dominant! 
&gt;When working with open source JSF frameworks There are really only 2 implementations of JSF itself; Mojarra and MyFaces and they are both open source. You might be talking about component libraries, like PrimeFaces and RichFaces. &gt;When working in projects with JSF 1.x (still around) the view language and configuration is a pain compared I won't deny that, but do we also still think Java is rubbish because it doesn't JIT? (Java 1.0 didn't JIT).

Have you heard of PrimeFaces and IceFaces? I think JSF is here to stay. 
you can either break the loop when the condition is met, or make the condition part of the loop. loop break (inside the loop): if(newPop &gt;= globalVar) break; or loop condition: double newPop = 0.0; while(newPop &lt; globalVar){ //inside here dont redeclare newPop, just reassign it }
Thanks! I'll use the first way, but both are really helpfull for me in the future :) Trying to teach myself and it's awesome with a subreddit full of people to ask at times :)
keep in mind though, any variable you want to use after the loop is ended must be declared outside the loop. in other words, if you want to use newPop (or any other) after the loop ends, you cant declare it inside the loop like while(...){ double newPop = ... } you have to declare it before the loop starts like double newPop = 0.0; while(...){ newPop = ...; } cheers.
Oh bah blah blah. You are just being trivial. I didn't say that JSF was coded in JSP and that's not the point anyway. 
noticed that after fucking up a few times ;) Thanks :)
Well, the point is that one way or the other JSF has no dependencies on JSP. It DOES have dependencies on Servlet or Portlet (although these two are largely abstracted away), but not on JSP. JSP is like a plug-in for JSF, and I can't stress enough that it's deprecated for use with JSF.
&gt;I mean things like Oracle's ADF. I had a hunch you meant that ;) Yes, Oracle ADF is a bit of a special case. It's not JSF perse, but build on JSF. It extends JSF with supposedly handy extra things (never checked if they are indeed handy). &gt;The difference being that there are new JSF 1.x projects being done in 2013! Really? That's just wrong! Of course I know all about legacy in the enterprise, but starting new projects using a severely legacy technology that's known to have serious problems is really asking for problems. Don't forget that JSF 1.x is from 2006. It's some 7 years old now. Even JSF 2.0 is already 4 years old. I can somewhat understand starting new projects on Java 6, instead of Java 7. The difference isn't really that much (but it's silly since Java 6 is EOL), but JSF 1.x or EJB 2.x, really... someone need to fire someone for letting that happen. 
&gt; I can somewhat understand starting new projects on Java 6, instead of Java 7. Two months ago our consulting company got a request for proposal for a Java 1.4 project.
did you run those commands to fix it? Or how did you fix it, for future reference
Try /r/javahelp next time.
I tried, but they didn't seem to work. (For the record, I probably input them wrong or something.) I ended up going into each individual file (after first deleting the registry entries), and re-allowing myself access and deselecting "Hidden" and "Read-Only". It was a bit tedious, but it accomplished what needed to be done.
sorry didn't know it existed 
Or combine them: for ( double population = 0.0; population &lt; limit; ) { population = ...; }
I guess you're not aware of this fact, but JSF 2.2 is scheduled to be released [March 27th, 2013](http://jdevelopment.nl/jsf-22/). This version of JSF is awesome! It also seamlessly integrates with HTML 5 in the least intrusive fashion yet.
Can you get them onto a file sharing site, and more people can look at this? Once done, let us know what you are struggling with. We can but try to offer what educational help we can.
I'll try, do you have a site you'd like to suggest?
How about Dropbox?
Zip the files up, then stick the zip in your public folder on dropbox and let us know the URL: The Public folder lets you easily share single files in your Dropbox. Any file you put in this folder gets its own Internet link that you can share with others -- even non-Dropbox users! Step 1: Drop a file into the Public folder. Step 2: Right-click this file, then choose Dropbox &gt; Copy Public Link. This copies an Internet link to your file that you can paste anywhere: emails, instant messages, blogs, etc. That's it! To share your file, just send the link to a friend. Happy Dropboxing! - The Dropbox Team P.S. You can only link to actual files within your Public folder, not to folders. For help with sharing files visit http://www.dropbox.com/help/16
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oik5tyldtogytro/W_Fb0Ncq-s how's that?
Well, I guess I could plug my library, [TinySound](http://finnkuusisto.github.com/TinySound/). I won't claim that it's the best by any means though.
here's the link to the files https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oik5tyldtogytro/W_Fb0Ncq-s The purpose of my program is to organize my chemistry teacher's lab equipment.
Sick dude, sick!
&gt; I won't claim that it's the best by any means though. To possibly help the OP, did you have any libraries that you tried prior to resorting to coding your own - if so which ones did you try, what did they do well, and what was their fundamental flaw(s)?
Don't just dump your undocumented code and expect people to read it all, comprehend it, find the problems, and then tell you what the fixes are. You need class descriptions and method descriptions. Preferably in javadoc. I don't know why your program has two Driver classes. Which one is the right one? Why do you use your own implementation of LinkedList and your own (or, actually, one copied from a book) file reader/writer? And why the heck does your Item class use nodes of the linked list? Why do you use a RandomAccessFile? Seriously, it sounds like you're doing as much stuff you can find to make it more difficult for yourself and tripping up over it. Your Inventory.dat would be easier to parse if it were formatted like so (now newlines and colons are illegal characters but if you cared about that, you should be using XML or some other standard format): Beaker1:Drawer 2B:10.0 Beaker3:Drawer 2B:10.0 Beaker4:Drawer 2B:10.0 Beaker5:Drawer 2B:10.0 Beaker2:Drawer 2B:10.0 Then you could do something like: LinkedList&lt;Item&gt; itemList = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(); List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(fileLocation.toPath(), Charset.defaultCharset()); for(String line : lines) { String[] tmpArray = line.split(":"); itemList.add(new Item(tmpArray[0],tmpArray[1],tmpArray[2])); } By the way, I didn't read all your code so I don't know if the above helps/works for you. EDIT: This is also probably more appropriate /r/learnprogramming or something. And next time, use gist rather than dropbox.
Maybe you should try to ask some specific questions. Most people (like me) are against posts that basically say, "hey reddit, can you do my homework for me?" If you're not going to make any effort to figure out specifically what things you are struggling with and formulate questions based on that, why should anyone make any effort to help you? I'm not trying to attack you, but you're going about this in the wrong way.
I'm sorry I've been at this for a while now, and I'm getting a bit desperate. I am trying to create nodes that I would be able to write into and read out of a RandomAccessFile. I have 3 string variables and a double that need to be in each node. I have the RAF class taken care of that wasn't a huge problem, but I don't know how to combine it with a LinkedList. I wish I didn't have to, but combining 2 advanced data structures is a Mastery Factory that is necessary. Did that help at all?
OK, from the overview of the app, it looks like its doing what its mean to do "organize the lab equipment". What specifically are your problem areas that we can help with? I.e. what is it you are trying to do, but can't figure out what to do. If it's high level, it's likely we'll provide high level models. If it's a particular method thats not compiling we'll be able to provide more specific information. Also, it's bad form to take existing classes like EasyReader/EasyWriter, and change their packages. You should leave these in their existing path structure (you create the folders com/skylit/io in your source folder, with these files in), and then you import com.skylit.io.EasyReader and import com.skylit.io.EasyWriter in the import block of the classes that need it.

Ah, the cores of serialisation. For me, I would make Item responsible for handling the reading and writing of each Item object, rather than the Driver2 or RAFDriver class. The Driver2 and RAFDriver classes can still set up the RAF and make calls to the appropriate (to be written) methods to read/write from a given RAF, and the Driver2/RAFDriver classes can append each Item into the array they store.
I'm going to be completely honest with you. I have a horrible teacher who has lectured to the 2 of us, (the number of people taking IB HL CS), about 5 times, we've had no quizzes, no homework, and one test. So if you could tell me this in terms of JAVA, (not actually doing if for me of course), and not telling me how to do this conceptually that'd be extremely helpful.
Have a public static void method in Item which takes the RAF and an item, for writing an item. Have a public static Item method in Item which takes the RAF, and returns an item. The write method hopefully should be quite simple, as you simply write the fields out and write something that identifies this as an Item in the first part, like "Item:" - you can use this to check in the read. The read method, should first of all read in the "Item:" check, and throw an exception, or return null whichever you feel comfortable with. If you pass the Item check, then create a new Item object, read in each of the fields, set the values in the newly created Item, and then return the Item object. When you are writing the file from the Driver class, you can call the static write method for each item. When you are reading the file from the Driver class, you open the RAF, and then call the static read method. If you are given a null or exception, then you have a problem you weren't prepared for, or reached the end of the file. You keep calling the read method until you reach the end of the file (think returning null object). The driver classes can then be responsible for managing the addition of the items to the LL.
Sorry, I was AFK for a bit. I had just been using [Clip](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/sampled/Clip.html)s prior. They don't seem to be terribly reliable on Linux and I found them hard to load/use (especially when trying to play the same sound multiple times simultaneously). TinySound doesn't have these issues. I've also messed around with OpenAL a bit, but I wanted an option that was implemented entirely in Java so as not to require distribution of native libraries.
Thank you "simplify it" would have been an easier explanation, but I'm glad you got the gist lol. All I am confused about it this, "Item: ". I've never written that before, what does it mean?
Please don't go any further into doing his homework for him.
Thanks, I think this looks good. I had used PaulsCode 3d Sound System, but I was looking for something much smaller and was pure java. I had been thinking about using JMF, that sounded like it would be much larger than I wanted. I'll try using this.

Wait, so are you using your own GregorianCalendar class or Java's? You define one that extends ToDoList (which itself seems a bit nonsensical, but never mind that) on line 131. My recommendation would be to write something much simpler to test the different parts of what you are trying to make. A simple main method that instantiates GregorianCalendar and prints it would be a good place to start.
java's. the extend was just me trying to fix it. sorry 
Use regexps instead of that giant blob of spaghetti. Something like (off the top of my head, untested) List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile("\\d+").matcher(input); while (matcher.find()) { numbers.add(Integer.parseInt(matcher.group())); }
So what's the problem? The output is that it should be.
i need the date from the file in the output
Thanks! This is a solution I had not thought of!
RENDER....as-in the standard JSF render kit produces HTML and JavaScript during the render life-cycle phase. JSF, especially the add-on component libraries, saves you from having to deal with tons of HTML/CSS/JS but those technologies are still used. A good example of AJAX being built-in is the partial page render in the trinidad components: http://myfaces.apache.org/trinidad/devguide/ppr.html
Thanks, I already figured that a statementless for loop would be suitable for this :) I'm on my phone right now so I don't have all my code. But here's how the population system works: In every town you have a population. And you also have a number that indicates the perceptual increase in population each round. So what I tried was to make a program that could estimate how many rounds it would take to reach a certain goal (ex. 10000 inhabitants). This is helpful for me since I am way too addicted to this game, and with the estimates the program gives me I now which tax rate will be most beneficial, what to build etc. I have now fixed the program so it works, but of course it's not 100% accurate since a village could be attacked, which stops immigration, or they could get the plauge or a bad harvest or something. Anyways I solved the problems I had, finaly, and everything seems to calculate exactly the same as my manual calculations and the game. I can send you the code onve I get access to a Pc if you want it :) EDIT: my current code import java.util.Scanner; public class rome{ public static void main(String[] args){ Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); for(;;){ System.out.print("How high do you want your population value to be: "); double goal = in.nextDouble(); System.out.print("\nEnter population: "); double pop = in.nextDouble(); System.out.print("Enter procentual increase: "); double procent = in.nextDouble() / 100; int rounds = 1; double increase; for(;;) { increase = pop * procent; pop = increase + pop; double newPop = Math.round( pop * 1.0 ) / 1.0; double Increase = Math.round( increase * 1.0 ) / 1.0; System.out.println("Increase: " + Increase + "\nNew population value: " + newPop + "\nRounds needed: " + rounds); rounds = rounds + 1; if(newPop &gt;= goal) break; } } } }
Shame it's a preview, nothing to play with. Looks interesting though, and would be good to make code reviews more social and engaging.

I quote my answer from another comment: &gt; **SPEED**. Hash tables can be used in any situation in which you need a fast lookup structure with almost constant insertion, removal and access time, independently of how many elements are contained in it. This advantage becomes more noticeable with large ammounts of data in. &gt; Hashtables are able to work so fast at the expense of memory footprint: for a hashtable to work correctly, it needs to have "spare" or empty buckets. The relationship between the element count and the bucket count is called load factor. For the same amount of data, the higher the load factor is, the lower performance (and memory footprint) you will have: you have less buckets -less memory is used by the structure- but more entries per bucket -more collissions: more time needed to look for a value in them-, conversely, the lower the load factor is, the higher the performance (and memory footprint) will be: hash collisions are minimized, as it will be more usual for each key to have its own bucket.
It just seems like people are struggling to squeeze things into an outdated framework. Even with the 2.2 version of JSF, isn't it a framework for server side web development that goes contrary to the current movement towards rich internet applications in the browser? There are lots of component frameworks and such in javascript/html5 for javascript/html5. It seems like the only reason to go with JSF is if you aren't comfortable breaking away from Java altogether in your display tier. By the way, we've reached a point in the D.C. area where there are more jobs for "java and jquery" than there are for "java and jsf" (per searches on dice.com).
I used OpenAL indirectly before, but I had been thinking of something that was os-independent. I just don't want the trouble of having native libraries.
Are you asking us to do it for you.. lol..
Why not just learn javascript, html5 and jquery instead of JSF? There are plenty of component libraries and tools nowadays for these things. Is it because you'd prefer to stay with Java as your primary language? I think JSF was designed when we were all doing server-side java web development and to try and make that technology fit around the currently "hot" paradigm of rich client web apps in html5/javascript is a stretch. I understand if a enterprise already has a large investment in JSF apps that they don't want to scrap it ... but for new projects?
Okay, so now I see the task you have, but I'm afraid you forgot to tell us how could we be of any help.
Read [this](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/objectcreation.html). TL;DR - Before the constructor is called, you have to call `new` somewhere which kicks off a step called *instantiation*. which allocates memory for the object being created. `new` then hands over control to the correct constructor which kicks off a step called *initialization*. The `this` reference makes sense after the *instantiation* step, because there is an object in memory and `this` points to it. That's why you can refer to `this` inside the constructor, even though the object isn't fully initialized.
Instead of your second infinite for, I'd suggest double newPop = 0.0; while (newPop &lt; goal) { And of course remove the second declaration of newPop within the cycle.
Could you clarify exactly where inside the code you would place this? I'm not really sure how to go about this, or what it would change :/
I don't think so! For all we know that current movement you talk about is just a passing fad. Things come and go into IT, that's nothing new. JSF has been there for some time and it continues to evolve and prove itself to be relevant. And there are lots of component frameworks in JavaScript/HTML5??? Yeah, there sure are. It's a complete and utter mess with a new one comming out nearly every week and claiming to be the one and only, that's cooler and more a hype than all others, including the one from last week that claimed the exact same thing...
Well, as shOrugOru said. However, better watch, here you are a null pointer exception: class Starter { private Callee _callee; private int anInt = 1; public Starter() { _callee = new Callee(this); anInt = 3; } public int getInt() { return _callee.getAnotherInt(); } } class Callee { private int anotherInt = 5; public Callee(final Starter starter) { System.err.println(starter.getInt()); } public int getAnotherInt() { return anotherInt; } } The constructor of callee calls the getInt, which in turn tries to call the stored _callee's getAnotherInt - but the equation not yet finished in the constructor of Starter, so _callee is still null. [This article](http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/initializationP.html) is long I allow, but gives you all the details. That's why it's long... EDIT: typo corrected
Server side presentation of state a bad thing? Not really! Lots of apps have state, and whether you hide that state away in a DB while pretending to be stateless, or admit that you have state and distribute it over your nodes where it's needed, doesn't change that basic fact. Plus, JSF does have a stateless mode now...
You have two for(;;) lines, the second one should be replaced, then you'll be able to eliminate the "if(newPop&gt;=goal) break;" line. The difference is, that it's easier to read, more understandable, something that programmers usually do instead of your solution which might count during an interview, and so on... the "for" we use going from a start point to an end point with intervals. for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i += 4) The "while" we use to repeat something until a condition becomes false. boolean I_have_no_ice_cream = false; while ( ! I_have_no_ice_cream ) { I_have_no_ice_cream = keepAskingForIceCream(); } And the last one, if we want the body to run at least one: do { I_have_no_ice_cream = KeepAskingForIceCream(); } while ( ! I_have_no_ice_cream); 
How do you specify something else? Can you pack in a font of your choice?
Ok that actually makes alot more sense :) Thank you!
General Swing tips (this will solve all your problems ;) * Always use LayoutManager in UI * Use FontMetrics to measure text in custom painting * Don't assume anything about font size (and text colors) * Don't hardcode component sizes, e.g. window.setSize(1000, 800)
I am taking a Java class taught from a book published in 2004. Not "first published" in 2004, but from 2004. Unfortunately that means that I have no idea what "LayoutManager" is. The only way I have been taught or even knew/know laying out UI is possible is by "hardcoding sizes". I use setBounds for all UI elements because if I don't they don't appear on the contentPane. At this point it seems like I almost need to start from scratch because what I am learning is probably not doing me any favors. So what is the preferred way to handle fonts? What is FontMetrics? Even if you give me some links so I can read about this myself...I would be highly grateful. 
Thank you so much!
Thank you for taking the time to respond!
Generally, youd make a class that extends a library class, and code in features that you want to add to the default. 
there are lots of threads about tutorials and books, try a subreddit search. you also might want to check out /r/javahelp for additional links and threads.
hint: you can embed a panel in your borderlayout.CENTER and put a gridlayout on that panel. So you can have multiple layouts by using panels. Or you can use a more sophisticated layout manager (miglayout, etc) do to part / or all the job. 
On a serious not google around for "rvm for java" or "java manage versions" I have never used or heard of one but there has to be a few.
I've done some searching, unfortunately I've not found much worthwhile, hence the post. :( Thanks for the idea, forgot RVM was a thing.
Do you need to clean up your java install though? How many do you have installed?
I'm not sure what part 1 and part 2 specifically refer to, but looking at the assignment instructions it looks like you did part of bulleted item: The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance and annualInterestRate. Perhaps if you finish this and the rest of the bulleted items, the test account portion may be more clear.
Here is a good series of youtube videos to get you on your way. http://www.bhecker.com/itu/viewforum.php?f=2 
thenewboston on YouTube has some good video tutorials.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look!
The official tutorials are as simple and to the point as you can get: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ Start with ones in the basic section!
* [Layout Manager Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/index.html) * There are also recommended 3rd party LM like [MigLayout](http://www.miglayout.com/) * [FontMetrics](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/text/measuringtext.html) is more advanced topic. Maybe you don't need it right now, but it's good to known it exists.
Java by itself is not an aspect-oriented language, so you do not get getters and setters for free. You will need to implement: public double getBalance() { return balance; }, etc for all of the private attributes that you want to expose in the interface. Right now you only have a setter for ID. If you are using Eclipse, you can do this: Right Click-&gt;Source-&gt;Generate getters and setters and it will create them for you
This one is the best ;) http://duke.kenai.com/SunRIP/SunRIPsmall.jpg
Setting JAVA_HOME is the default way afaik. I have 4 1.7s (all oracle dev previews oddly enough) and 2 Apple 1.6s. Actually one of them at least is OpenJDK according to java -version. Your projects could set JAVA_HOME (kind of like how a lot of projects bundle a JRE or an app server etc)
~~Sun's~~ Oracle's [Java tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) are pretty good.
There is a wealth of time savers in eclipse's right-click menu but the "Generate Getters/Setters" was by far the one I used the most. All you have to do is declare the private variables up top and then it takes care of most of the busy work for you!
Again, it isn't javascript, html5, jquery instead of *JSF*. It is ME instead of JSF creating JavaScript, HTML, jQuery. Honestly it comes down to time. If JSF has the components I need it is faster to use JSF than to create portable web UIs myself. jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile are improving rapidly but honestly still suck in some ways. If I am creating a fairly standard data entry form driven web app JSF wins. If it is a "cool" looking site with a highly customized UI the yes, I'd probably do the UI in html/js/css with a RESTful Java backend. Either way I'd still say Java was the primary language of the application. You can also do both, if you are a JavaScript/HTML/CSS guru you can create UI components and package them up into JSF components that way the people that don't know JavaScript as well as you can use your component.
You can for sure use dice.com to survey the technologies in use. Recruiters and HR people don't make up things about jquery. They take whatever job description the technical team gives them and past it into their b.s. template. Obviously a search for "java and jquery" will give some hits that aren't meaningful ... but on average the trend is pretty revealing. You can do a spot-check on some random listings in the search results and see for yourself.
I know this sounds obvious, but have you tried the instructions here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html This is what I did and there is no problem. I've read that libexec is not working for you. Is there any kind of error or it's not an option in your environment?

Sure, I can try. Imagine you have a collection of socks. There are 50 of them. They are all different. Now let's say you have a match to one of those socks. You don't know which one, but you want to find the match as fast as possible, because you have a hot date tonight and this girl/guy loooves matching socks. Okay, so you need to *search* the 50 socks. But what's the best way to do this? For the task at hand, searching, there are some ways to search the socks that will be faster than others. For example, say you line the socks up in a long row and give them each a corresponding number. How long will it take you find the match at the very longest? Well, if you go through each sock one by one, that would be the 50th sock. So the search operation on 50 socks in a long row (array, and actually linked list too! :) ) is O(50). Let's generalize this. Say instead of 50 socks, you have n socks. Following the same reasoning, you can say that in the worst case, you it will take you n tries to match the sock, so searching an array takes O(n). Different data structures are optimal for different types of operations, as far as processing time. Other operations include inserting, and sorting etc.. Some algorithms are faster than others for the same operation too. There are many different types of sorting, some faster in some situations. Let's start with this. Shoot a reply and I can help you fill in whatever gaps you feel like you have :). EDIT: Big - O notation is essentially the worst case run time for an algorithm or some operation.
Yes, format it and put windows on it. Sadly Windows is a much better platform for Java compared to the mac.
As I understand it, Big-O notation is a way to approximate the length of time an operation will take. The term come from looking at the highest order, and I find it easiest to think of it in mathematical terms rather than programming - for example consider the equation n^2 - n + 70000. We're only interested in the highest order, so this would be O(n^2). This nicely highlights something - we assume that n is a high number, i.e. that it tends for infinity. So even though for low values the +70000 will be the biggest factor, we ignore this and are only looking at the highest order. We also only care about the order, so 100n^2 - n + 70000 is O(n^2 ), just like n^2 - n + 70000 (i.e. the multiplication by 100 isn't taken into consideration). Perhaps an example is better. Consider the problem where we have to sum the integers from 1 to n. there's a couple of ways we can do this: 1. A simple for loop 1:n; this takes n iterations to complete, and so is O(n). 2. We can use the formula n(n+1)/2; this is the same number of operations regardless of how high n is, and so executes in constant time: O(1), which is better than O(n). 3. We could do something idiotic, like repeat the loop from 1 n times to make sure we've definitely got the right answer. This will take n times longer than 1, which means it completes in O(n^2 ), and so is worse than the method used in 1. Here's the [obligatory Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), which gives a lot more information. Edit: RunHomeJack's edit makes a very good TL:DR point - Big-O notation is essentially the worst case run time for an algorithm or some operation.
It's not really worst-case, it's more like "I know it's not *slower* than that" - you can also give best-case runtime in big o notation. There's also Big Omega (it's not faster than that) and Big Theta (it's about that fast).
&gt; It's not really worst-case, it's more like "I know it's not slower than that" How does "it's not slower than that" differ from worst-case - I assume there's some subtlety that I'm missing?
Like I said, you can also give an algorithm's best-case performance in big o notation - for example, every sane sorting algorithm is O(1) on an already sorted list. EDIT: also, there are several o classes for one algorithm: O(1) is in O(n) is in O(n^2) etc.
Never. I've got BSD with a workable UI. 
I could write something out, but I think these two links do a better job than I could: [Lambdas and closures] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/220658/what-is-the-difference-between-a-closure-and-a-lambda) [Lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)
One of apple's worst moves. 
Your version of java is being set somewhere else then. Search through your profiles for java home being set. I'm on lion and I used several pre- release 1.7 builds and I routinely switch between 1.6 , 1.7, and 1.8 preview releases without problem. Delete the java from your library directory and you should be fine.
Okay, I'll give that a try tomorrow. Thanks!
The lambda calculus is a way of describing computations (programs) as the recursive application of functions. Even numbers are defined as the result of function application. *Everything* is a function. A lambda expression is basically a model of a computation (a program). The lambda calculus is the basis of the functional programming languages, and Haskell is about the closest you can get to writing programs with pure lambda expressions. The other model of computation is the Turing machine, which describes calculations as a sequence of operations on a tape (memory), and is the basis of the imperative programming languages, like Java. A closure is a function that creates a copy of the environment in which it was created. Java doesn't really have closures. The closest thing is anonymous inner classes, but local variables must be final and the inner class doesn't get a copy of the outer instance variables of the class the anonymous inner class was created in, because changes in the outer environment are reflected in the inner environment and vice-versa. However, objects can be seen as a very specialized form of closures. Java's lambda expressions are really just "syntax sugar" for anonymous inner classes with a Single Abstract Method. Lambda expressions significantly reduce boilerplate, but you don't get any of the advantages of *real* lambda expressions, such as higher order functions (functions that operate on functions) because Java doesn't have first class functions, only interfaces and classes. So really, learning about the lambda calculus isn't really going to help you understand how to get the most out of lambda expressions in Java 8. But learn it anyways! You'll learn a lot more about computer science and different ways of thinking about writing computer programs.
Yes, there is an application setting the a java_home with a different value. Which version of apple JDK do you have installed?

Why use an online one? You can download eclipse for free. Or even notepad ++. edit:spelling
Do you know when a computer science would typically learn lambda calculus? Is it something typically taught alongside discrete structures/discrete mathematics?
I learned the basics of the lambda calculus, Turing machines, finite state and non-deterministic automata, etc. in a theory of computation course I took in the lower division of the undergraduate computer science program at the University of Texas. I think the more advanced stuff (which you see in the wiki) is covered in more detail in the graduate program. With the internet of course you can save a lot of time (and money) and learn on your own! 
Ahh I see. I feel like several of the concepts are a little above me at the moment. I don't understand the basics of anonymous functions and there are several other concepts mentioned that I haven't learned yet. I'll definitely check out tutorials for it as soon as I can though!
Boom. Detailed **and** easy to understand. Thank you very much!
Go talk to your professor! That is why they have office hours. Just to edit for clarity, I have heard this topic from multiple professors and while the concept is the same how they want you to apply the information is usually different. Only your professor can help you understand how they want you to know it for your upcoming test(s). 
No, it ca, also be the upper bound of the best case. (That's just not as common.)
Yes, that should work.
&gt;It just seems like people are struggling to squeeze things into an outdated framework Judging from the vigor with which you are plugging javascript frameworks, it seems like your "question" is a bit of a troll instead of an honest one.

Your mother is a troll. I'm just a mid-level Java developer trying to figure out what to focus on in my next skill refresh. I did not plug the Javascript frameworks. I started a healthy debate, which is tough when some of the Java religious feel threatened.
Here we did this a while ago, http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l8hge/programming_task_roman_numeral_converter/
Thanks a lot! =)
Ok! Thanks for the answers. I will look in to it and see if I can change these things!
I think the main issue is that many developers don't grasp the concepts of interfaces vs classes. It takes a while of OO experience in multiple languages before it clicks.
This is some very long method. If I would be to refactor this, I would first extract the whole logic into a method that takes proper input and returns proper output (like string/int or similar). This would allow create some unit tests. Next step would be to create some unit tests, to cover some (at least) basic converting scenarios. After that I would start with extracting each of the short if statements into a separated method with appropriate name. The result of this should be that you have one "high level" method that talks to you in English about what is actually happening. Hopefully after that it would be possible to find some additional places how to improve it.
The best situation is when you know from the outset how big the list will be and initialize ArrayList accordingly.
tried it...same result :/
Don't put your "business" code in your user interface class. Don't use Swedish in your code. Only English. Don't use unnecessarily cryptic variable names. Edit: here's an old thread with solutions for that problem: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/658ys/how_to_recognise_a_good_programmer/
Here is the new one that I made. Is this the sort of structure that you think is legitimate or did I missunderstand you :p? https://github.com/Grilledstick/Programming-Java/blob/master/Redone%20Roman%20Numeral%20Converter
Thanks! I did just redo my program, I have moved all of the calculating code to a separate method. Is it better to take out each fraction from that code aswell and move them into separate methods? Now, all of the calculation code is in one method. So I calculate how many "M" and how many "X" there should be in the same method. Is that bad? Thanks!
I still have yet to get their product properly installed with that bullshit licensing scheme they have. Not to mention they **doubled** the price recently and it's subscription based. I like what jrebel is supposed to do, so I look forward to a competitor eating their lunch with more straightforward licensing setup. When the hardest part about using your product is licensing related, you're doing it wrong.
Someone else here suggested to separate the counting functionality to separate class. Its a good idea. Also I *think* that the three ifs are very similar, it seams to me that there should be only one method that is containing the logic and has parameters that are used to distinguish between different letters. 
Whenever you are dealing with x*y problems you know you'll have to use matrices. Create an int matrix that is of size of tiles and as the program runs initialize all of values to 0. When a tile is clicked set that element of the matrix to be 1 and repaint. Inside paint component repaint all of the tiles with check: if the value of int matrix for the coordinates is 0, paint it as unchecked, if it's 1 paint it as checked. 
Scala collections /s Or Guava
But those are used in quite specific scenarios, and they would be an overkill on most situations.
Also, if you need synchronization on pretty much any java Collection object, you can always use Collections.synchronizedList/Set/Map to wrap your container and use it thread-safely. **NOTE**: In most of the cases, the solution to thread safety in collections is not synchronization but choosing a more specific implementation of your container.
Check out google Guava, they have some cool collections like Bi-directional Dictionaries and graphs (to replace List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;)
Also, if the line List&lt;String&gt; ls = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); doesn't compile, you need to either update your JDK or do: List&lt;String&gt; ls = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
You might want to post this question on /r/javahelp.

StringBuilder is your friend.. was going to post exactly this
Good answer. I totally agree that a blend is the best path in terms of career direction. The list of things I feel that I should learn is a little too long right now so I'm going to have to pick a few and hope for the best. I've been out of coding for a few years so my skills were in Java 5, Swing, JSF 1.2 and WebSphere Portal. Right now, to me, RIA with JQuery and HTML5 seems like a fresh and interesting area to get into. And I also feel like tons of jobs in the d.c. area call for Spring and Hibernate. So I'm leaning towards the following: JQuery and HTML5, RESTful services with JSON, Spring (but which parts?) and Hibernate. I'll have to put off EJB3, JSF2.x, CDI, JAX-WS etc for the time being or i'll go crazy. Am I making any sense?
When they go towards you they overlap and I've been trying forever to see it that they don't.
Same as OP, just formatted: for(int i=0;i&lt;GameDraw.enemy1.size();i+=4){ if(GameDraw.player.getX()&gt;GameDraw.enemy1.get(i)+10){ GameDraw.enemy1.set(i, GameDraw.enemy1.get(i)+1); } if(GameDraw.player.getX()&lt;GameDraw.enemy1.get(i)-10){ GameDraw.enemy1.set(i, GameDraw.enemy1.get(i)-1); } if(GameDraw.player.getY()&gt;GameDraw.enemy1.get(i+1)+10){ GameDraw.enemy1.set(i+1, GameDraw.enemy1.get(i+1)+1); } if(GameDraw.player.getY()&lt;GameDraw.enemy1.get(i+1)-10){ GameDraw.enemy1.set(i+1, GameDraw.enemy1.get(i+1)-1); } }
[Javadocs is your friend.](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html) Yeah, except the methods are lowercase (i.e. `list.get(i)`) The methods I use most are: - list.add(element); - list.remove(element); - list.get(index);
Its not a course I'm taking. I just bought a java programming text book and decided to learn.
Also, if you're moving from C# to Java, you may not have used Java's generics before. If you're used to C#, you may want to write: List&lt;int&gt; playerIDs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); This, however isn't valid Java. The type you put between the angle brackets (here `int`) must be a class rather than a primitive data type. Java does have class wrappers for its primitive types (`int`, `char`, `boolean`...), such as `Integer` and `Double`. So, you write: List&lt;Integer&gt; playerIDs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); These primitives wrapped in classes are also used for other things, the most common one (for me at least) is converting `String`s to numbers. For example: String s = "42"; int answer = Integer.parseInt(s);
Thanks! =) Ah yeah, sorry. The capitalization was a C#ism. xD Yeah I went there, but I was like "I can't see anything about using []. Am I missing something? I better ask someone who knows what he's doing, lol". Glad to know at least my instincts are in the right direction. =)
Where are you getting the 's' for LetterProfile? Perhaps you want a parameter?
s is a string that is defined in the driver file. When you reference it in LetterProfile, the variable is not visible, hence the compiler error 's cannot be resolved'. You gota figure out how to make the string visible to your LetterProfile class for it to operate on.
Neither your Processing class nor your charTally() method define a variable s. It works when you combine the classes, because s is defined in your main() method in the Driver class. The best way would probably be, to define a parameter "String s" in the charTally() method and pass it through the methods you call.
Yes, I realized that already (sorry if i didn't mention that). I am just lost trying to make the string visible for it to operate on. 
No, the reverse is true. These classes fit most situations safely, and you should only use the unsafe but potentially faster classes in very specific situations, where you're sure that many threads don't touch your data structures simultaneously. This will be difficult with Java 8 parallelisation. If you have any idea of what you're doing, you wouldn't want to synchorinze colletion access.
I personally prefer to write it: for(String s : stringList) { System.out.println(s); } The equivalent C# of course is: foreach(string s in stringList) { Console.WriteLine(s); } But yes, the `for(T t : list)` loop is so useful. Just be careful not to remove items from the list if you're iterating like that. What I mean is, the following code is bad: for(String s : stringList) { if("something".equalsIgnoreCase(s)) { stringList.remove(s); } }
class palindrome { public static void main(String[] args) { String userWord; int sp = 0; int ep = 0; boolean yes; yes = true; System.out.println("Enter word to find out if it is a palindrome: "); userWord = TextIO.getWord(); ep = userWord.length() -1; while (sp &lt;= ep) { if (userWord.charAt(sp) != userWord.charAt(ep)){ // checking if yes = false; break; } sp++; // move up one character ep--; // move back one character } if (yes == true) { System.out.println("Word entered is a Palindrome"); } else; } }
Again, they are two different classes, so you need to send that 's' to the other function, which requires a parameter. EG public void foo(String str) { } foo("bar");
Read up on constructors and encapsulation. This should help you a fair bit.
Right - but that's still the upper bound of a specific scenario, i.e. the worst case for the specific conditions.
 public void charTally(String s){ for(int j = 0; j &lt; s.length(); j++){ .... } } 
The Lotus Domino API (as of version 8 at least) still requires the use of Vector - hard to argue that it's reasonable API design from IBM mind you. Yuk.
Thanks so much guys!!!!!!!
Once upon a time I had to develop some LDAP code to interface with that product... had to break out a package sniffer to figure out what the Lotus Notes server did differently. Reasonable, it wasn't.
You need to change runProgram() to runProgram(String s) too. Then change text.runProgram(); to text.runProgram(s); and in your runProgram() method change charTally(); to charTally(s);. By doing that you pass your variable s that is originally created in the main method all the way through to your charTally() method. This needs to be done because methods don't know what exists out of their accessible space. A method can only see it's own variables, those of the class that contains it and static variables in other classes that allow access.
 /r/javahelp In terms of the actual problem, we need a little more information about what the classes you're using are. `i += 4` is a very odd iterator increment.
In Java, we have two main kind of collections. Keyed (Map) and keyless (List/Set). The later has two subtypes, "List" allows duplication, "Set" doesn't. Read the api doc, there you'll have the "classes implementing this interface". LinkedList - insert/delete or reorder is likely. ArrayList - Insert/delete or reorder is unlikely. HashSet - quick access. HashMap - quick access. TreeMap - sorted keys. Those are the ones I use frequently.
Hmmm... dunno your code, but Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle(x1, y1, width,1 height1); Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle(x2, y2, width2, height2); if (rect1.intersects(rect2)) { }
Off-topic: I can't remember why, but it seems I've got you tagged as "Nice". [\*shrug*](http://i.imgur.com/Eloeq3M.png)
Glad to be of service :) I post code reviews every once and a while, which might be how you tagged me (Being this is /r/java)
Ive always done this, but do you know why we have to use specific implementations when initializing?
GameDraw is a class with the array list enemy1. Each enemy I print out to the screen is a collection of 4 enemy1s. enemy1.get(0) = x enemy1.get(1) = y and so forth. 
Well, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)/[this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). Don't bother actually reading those to be honest though. Reasoning: - If you later needed to change from `ArrayList` to, say, `LinkedList`, you could do this through changing just one line of code (the initialization) - basically everything can stay the stay. - If you're exposing a public API then it's especially important to use the interface rather than the implementation - the user of your API shouldn't have to care whether, in the method `List&lt;String&gt; getPlayerNames()`, you're using an `ArrayList` or a `LinkedList` internally. Again, if you were in the future to change from one implementation to another, everyone using your methods would have to change their code too. Other people explain it much better than me however. There are many StackOverflow answers which give good reasons for why we do List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); rather than: ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); ---------- I've just re-read your question and realized I may have misinterpreted it. &gt;do you know why we have to use specific implementations when initializing? `List`, `Map`, `Set` and so on are all just *interfaces*. This means that they simply say what methods you should be able to perform on a `List` (/etc) of data - they don't actually provide the methods. To phrase it slightly differently, an interface simply says "there should be a method to add a new object to the list", but it doesn't say anything about *how* adding a new object to the list is actually performed. There are, of course, many different ways to implement a `List` (/`Map`/etc), and so we have to choose one when we're initializing. If we had an interface with no implementation, nothing would happen.
I think you interpreted it right the first time. Thank you for the detailed explanation, it makes sense to do it this way.
You're right on the crazy part. Learning all those JEE6 frameworks can drive you crazy....especially when WebSphere Portal or Application Server is involved. jQuery and HTML5 is fun, and it's pretty darn easy to learn and subsequently demonstrate what appear to be advanced techniques. There's also dojo, node.js, angular.js, or ember.js. If you can handle Java EE 5, you can handle these javascript frameworks with no problem. Here's my take on Hibernate...learn JPA (which will tie into the other technologies in the rest of this paragraph). Hibernate now offers 2 styles: old-school Hibernate style or its JPA implementation. I started with Hibernate, got my feet wet with Hibernate's JPA implementation, and have moved on to OpenJPA (WebSphere 8's implementation). I prefer JPA 2 over old-school Hibernate, because of how it integrates with EJB 3.1. EJB 3.1 handles all transaction management. With the elimination of all my hbm.xml files due to annotations plus the elimination of boilerplate code associated with transaction management, the amount of code I have to produce is drastically reduced. Now, how can you access those EJB's from your JSF managed beans? You can use @EJB or you can use @Inject via CDI. I chose CDI since it can inject anything (JSF managed beans and EJB beans). CDI is a response to Spring's DI. CDI will become the norm in Java EE. If you know JSF 1.2, most of the work going toward learning JSF 2.0 is done, though there's one quirk involving a "resources" folder that's used to store all of your images, css, js, etc. You need to write everything like "#{resource['css/webfonts/stylesheet.css']}", which gets annoying. Use OmniFaces 1.4.1 to get around that annoyance (thanks to BalusC and Arjan Tijms for that framework). I don't bother with JAX-WS unless I have to. I prefer JAX-RS any day. From the way things sound, you just need to learn EJB 3.1 and CDI. While CDI can seem hard to learn, learning EJB 3.1 within a JSF application will require little effort. Don't bother with Swing. Learn Java FX. Java FX will become the standard for Java SE GUI's. It will and is creeping into Java EE. It's good to know Spring as far as the job market goes...I just don't see it being as viable years down the road (FLAME ON!)... Spring was created to resolve the shortcomings of J2EE 4, but many of those shortcomings have disappeared. So, if that is indeed the case, then what's the point of learning Spring? Spring will stick around for years, but Java EE will keep taking ideas from Spring as time goes on. I've used Spring on the job in the past, btw. Spring feels like it's growing more complex as time goes on while Java EE's complexity is shrinking. If D.C. has a market yearning for Spring and Hibernate, then go for it. You've got to go with what reality gives you. Just be aware of and learn JEE 6 and JEE 7, lest you have the rug ripped out from under you in the future if the job market shifts. Other RIA alternatives for Java are Vaadin and Play.
Hopefully figuring out the difference between java and javascript. check out /r/webdev theres also something like a cs careers subreddit that I forget what it is offhand. cscareerquestions or something.
A lot of companies call a developer who writes, for example, jsf apps a "web developer". I know that many people would disagree with that naming but it is not at all uncommon. So while you've gotten a few upvotes for your snark that doesn't make it any less of a jackass thing for you to post.
Built in to what? 
I think this is a case of premature reverse-optimization - you're assuming all collections access needs to be thread-safe (and if you make this assumption, you're bound to get tripped up sooner or later anyway) and you're vastly hindering performance. Most enterprise Java applications don't use ArrayLists (etc) to share data between threads/modules anyway, they go through APIs/RPCs/etc.
Review how to read stack traces and thread dumps. Knowing how read them and track down errors is invaluable. You don't need to know a product to find where the error comes from. And you most likely will start by being exposed to existing minor bugs (a common thing I have seen).
 Parent bonding with the child using Java. Man..
Thanks for showing me this code :) As for the 45, 95, 495, 995 cases, you do not really need those since those are not legit roman numbers. What I mean by that is one should write "XLV" for 45 instead of "VL" since there is not any need to substract 5 from 50 when one could write it like "40 + 5" instead of "50 - 5". Also because the rules of roman says that you cannot put a letter before another letter if the latter is more than 10x bigger than the first one. As in your case of "XM" the x is 100 times smaller. 990 should be written like "CMXC". I agree about my code part though ;) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals
This is very subjective but... Ant/Tomcat first. Everyone should know how to build a war and deploy it. Maybe even throw some time in to understanding how to ssh a server and deploy on aws. If I interview a java dev and he can't get a server started from scratch, something is horribly wrong. Then Spring. And then practice making normal REST calls and you'll learn valuable concurrency knowledge along the way. You will never know everything about Java. Nor should you try. Focus on being a good engineer. Lots of great open source. Take advantage of it.
&gt; EDIT: HOW DO YOU FORMAT IT??!??!!?!?! Put 4 spaces before every line to create a code box, and don't forget manual line breaks. Oh, and btw: "And all those exclamation marks, you notice? Five? A sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head." - Terry Pratchett
First of all, I think you're a brave man for reading the complete reference. You shouldn't do that. Just keep it on the side, just in case you need it. Effective Java is a great book to write better code in terms of software design, so really read that someday. Now I don't know what internship you want to apply for, but considering the fact you're still a student and the company which provides this position has a lot of other Java developers that have far more experience you're able to get as a student and should support you, I believe you're fine already. Don't be afraid to be rejected. Tell them what you've been doing, you really liked learning all that stuff and only like to learn more about Java development and the technologies they're working with at their company as an intern. Expect to dive into a lot of technologies and and find clutters of horrible code as soon as you're in that position. Stay positive, learn everything you need to know to get the job done and even though "you're just intern", dare to discuss some things you find strange or think could have done better in some other way. Good luck!
Well that's one way of bonding.
So you did read a lot but how much did you code? What are some programs you've build? I see you didn't mention concurrency, I suppose you read about it. You should set yourself a coding task, something that will preoccupy you for a week or more until you finish it. You will manage to work out different libraries, OOP and learn a lot from experience. What I consider basic java is doing java with general understanding of OOP paradigm with most basic programming (standard) techniques and basic java libraries. More advanced java topics are: I/O, generics, concurrency, networking, Lists/Maps/etc, JAVA FX... You should build a program that implements swing GUI, concurrency (look up SwingWorker), maybe some FTP transfers, creating/writing/reading/deleting files? Look this up: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/ find a project that looks somewhat challenging, think about it and do it. You should most definitely not bother with any java web until you get some coding experience. Nothing can replace it. Creating apps is kind of addictive to me and when you get good at it, you'll might prefer to learn more from experience than reading.
well done.
Interesting. I'm fairly new to Java but I'm giving this a go.
I would have used dependency injection. 
What do you want to do with java? Maven and Gradle. Ant isn't an end user tool anymore so much as a tooling layer managed by tool providers (like Gradle and Maven). Databases. I would suggest service layer, root aggregate and jpa. Web development. You're all over the place here. Your list needs to be broken down further. Web development is a huge field. Spring by itself isn't "web development" it is a framework for doing all kinds of things, notably inversion of control. Spring-MVC and Struts are essentially the same, if you learn one, you'll be able to pick the other one up. Personally, I would go with spring-mvc. That's all framework level stuff. The rest you ask about is either framework component (provided by struts/spring-mvc or plugins). JEE - Wouldn't bother with ejb, jsp or servlets (pick them up as needed later). JSF is useful. Jetty (my pick for starting out), Glassfish, JBoss and Tomcat are all application servers, just learn what you need to and move on, unless you want to be a middleware administrator. One thing I would recommend learning and understanding is classloaders and memory management. There is nothing worse than a developer on my team who writes leaky code. Consider learning some modern methodologies like agile and test driven development. 
I think you become an intermediate when you realize that most of the serious problems on projects are ones you create yourself, and you've done it enough times to see them coming.
Yeah, my current job is maintaining a swing app. It is a pretty terrible API (but sadly not the worst I've seen... avoid smartgwt if you can help it...)
They allow Java applets (very restricted java programs that auto play in some browsers) to run as full Java Programs (which can do anything to your computer). Them being there is probably bad. In general, I'd recommend browsing with applet support off, since few people use applets legitimately anymore and probably deleting the viruses with a scanning utility. /r/techsupport may be able to better help you on the specifics.
Of course, it's in all caps, so it won't even compile. Some bonding experience _that_ will be!
Just code something already!
Thank you for your response
Cool, but why use the term "JEE", when it's clearly "Java EE"?
Smartgwt is just a smartclient wrapper.
Exactly.
You can use Math.random() to make a 50/50 chance for if ball is thrown. If it is not thrown, then Ball is not caught, and the loop ends.
It never ends. If it does, then either you're dead or the language is.
&gt;So you did read a lot but how much did you code? What are some programs you've build? Everything from Head First Java: A text-based Battleship game [arrays, io], a digital flash card manager [serialization, io, gui], a drum sequencer, [midi, serialization, io, gui], a simple chat client and server [threads, net, io]. Everything I can remember from Building Java Programs: A BMI calculator [gui], a program that parses data from a CSV file and displays it neatly [io], a credit card validator [gui], a program that counts all the occurrences of each unique word in a txt file [io, regex]. From my current class: implementing a linked list, array list, linked stack, linked queue, hashmap, and treemap. Testing everything with JUnit and pulling all our projects from a CVS repository and uploading them to a test server (all done through an eclipse plug-in though). As for personal projects I've made a colorful screensaver-like thing [gui] and a program that encodes text into valid bitmap files [data formats, io]. &gt;More advanced java topics are: I/O, generics, concurrency, networking, Lists/Maps/etc, JAVA FX... You should build a program that implements swing GUI, concurrency (look up SwingWorker), maybe some FTP transfers, creating/writing/reading/deleting files? Aside from Java FX and FTP transfers I've covered all of that (mostly thanks to the awesome projects in Head First Java). I don't feel particularly experienced or comfortable with any of those things though because my experience has been really shallow and limited. Sure, I can make a thread, and I can even use the synchronized modifier, but I have no idea what a semaphore is or how to properly use the wait() and notify() methods. I like a good handful of the ideas on martyr2's list but none of those projects are going to teach me semaphores unless I actually go learn and read about semaphores first and then figure out a way to apply them in the projects, otherwise I wouldn't know or think to use them.
Most Java jobs are in the EE space. The most popular EE technologies are included in a slimmed down list called the Java EE Web Profile. That list exists because most EE developers spend a lot of time make web-based applications. This is your starting list (in order): * HTML/CSS * Servlets (use Tomcat) * JSP (use Tomcat) * A little SQL and JDBC (use Derby or MySQL) * JPA (Use the Hibernate implementation so you can say hibernate on a resume) * EJB Lite (use TomEE) * XML (namespaces and schema) * StAX and JAXB * JAX-RS (add Jersey to TomEE) * JavaScript and JSON (DHTML and AJAX will happen here) * jQuery (and here too) * CDI I'd recommend taking a break about another year in and hitting all the GoF design pattern stuff (again, if you already have) and OO principles (http://www.oodesign.com/design-principles.html). Now the real work begins. You have a couple of options once you get the basics out of the way. Knowing basic Java EE + web tech isn't good enough, employers want you to be able to jump right into how "they" do Java EE. * Ant * Maven * jUnit * IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, etc) * JSF * EE backend technologies (JMS, JAX-WS) * Spring * They want you to be a junior DBA often, Learn Oracle database or SQL Server, DB2. * Application Server administration and internals: JBoss AS, WebLogic, WebSphere
Like the others have said, build apps and put them on the web (like Amazon AWS), and then you will be able to *show* people what you have worked on and they can even look at your code. Make sure that what you work on is what you're passionate about. Your passion will show in your work as well as when you talk about it. Anyone can code, but employers are looking for these days is passion. As for the various technologies, pick one in each category, and get a bit of experience in it. No one can expect you to know every single tool. If you get experience with one tool and understand the fundamentals, then you can apply those fundamentals to other tools. So if you have used Ant before, Maven is not going to be a huge learning curve. The people who read your resume know this as well (hopefully). Once you get into the workforce, you will know which technologies you need to focus on. Some of those technologies don't take a long time to ramp up on (maybe like a day or at most a week to get the basics). Concentrate on Core Java, read "Effective Java" for sure, and also read "Head First Design Patterns" as well. Another book I highly recommend is "Clean Code" by Robert Martin which covers a variety of different topics for today's Java Engineer. You aren't going to be tested in an interview about the specifics of libraries (unless you're at a Senior level), but you will be tested in your algorithms, Java, and Design skills. In fact, google "Java interview questions" and you will see how much you know. You'll be surprised at how many companies ask very basic/intermediate questions related to CS and Java. Start interviewing and you will find out. For example, one Amazon interview I took recently asked 1 Design question, 1 question related to graphs and breadth-first search, and 1 question was implement the fibonacci sequence. 
I'd use Jode -- http://jode.sourceforge.net/ -- to decompile the class files in the jar.
&gt;Databases. I would suggest service layer, root aggregate and jpa. I'm sorry but I don't know what any of that means. Regarding databases all I know so far is that I should buy a book on SQL and learn SQL. From there I should learn Hibernate. I don't know what I need to do afterward, if anything. &gt;Web development. You're all over the place here. Personally, I would go with spring-mvc. That's all framework level stuff. The rest you ask about is either framework component (provided by struts/spring-mvc or plugins). Really? Spring MVC takes care of all the XML, JSON, AJAX, SOAP, REST stuff? I guess I just need to read about it more. &gt;One thing I would recommend learning and understanding is classloaders and memory management. There is nothing worse than a developer on my team who writes leaky code. Oh, this is good, I've been meaning to read about this. Thanks for all the suggestions! I appreciate it.
Spring has turned into an unmanageable behemoth... it's true that you can do A LOT of things with it almost out of the box... but try changing one implementation of a Spring service with your own -let alone mixing different versions of Spring because of a new feature or bugfix in one library, or, worse, updating your app to use a newer Spring version- and you are going to have a BAD time. Also, as time passed, they've incorporated different technologies/libraries into the framework but, as you would expect, they haven't been developed with Spring in mind, so in the end you have a mix of methodologies and even conventions -you will find modules of Spring in which bean configuration is done with constructor arguments, and other modules in which the bean configuration is done setting bean properties-. I understand the need for Spring in agile environments because of its feature set and time-to-market, but I wouldn't rely on it for a complex application that will evolve for years instead of months. I'd rather model my system as a set of modules (OSGi FTW!) in which I can REALLY change a module with another one without the rest of the system failing because of dependency issues.
&gt;First of all, I think you're a brave man for reading the complete reference. You shouldn't do that. Just keep it on the side, just in case you need it. It's been very educational! Not many books are like, "Here's everything in the language and standard library explained!" Except it doesn't really cover all that much of the standard library, but at least hits the main packages. &gt;Effective Java is a great book to write better code in terms of software design, so really read that someday. Planning to this summer! And thanks for all of your other advice, it was great.
I've already got it sitting on my bookshelf, but I heard it's not for beginners and you should already be familiar with general concurrency stuff like locks and semaphores and et cetera. Is that true? Or can a beginner start reading Java Concurrency In Practice and meaningfully digest the material?
Many thanks! Currently, I also use Eclipse and I can say that I quite like it so far, for exactly the same reasons that you mentioned above. I definitely want to look into Git. My only problem is, that the machine I spend most of my time on is not hooked to the Internet (it's a development machine for control system programming and therefore it is only in the company network for whom we develop the control system) I think that I will have to spend some time with "plain" Java before I step forward to Android (something that is definitely on my TODO list for the near future). I just started with Java and need to familiarise myself further.
I'm saving this for one day when any of my future interns complain to me :)
Thank you so much for your advice! I really appreciate how you organized all the technologies and frameworks for me, because figuring out where to start and then where to go from there was one of my biggest dilemmas, so again, thank you for spelling it out for me.
Very good. This means you should branch out to field you generally are interest in. By learning from experience I didn't mean that you should just sit and code, of course there will be some reading involved, but since you are familiar enough with OOP you'd learn another more focused technique or library depending on project. I recently started learning Spring Framework so if this is a direction you want to take I'd suggest to start by learning servlets and jsp first. I recommend 'O'Reilly - Head First Servlets and JSP'.
I use IntelliJ to write Java both at home and at work. There's a community edition if you don't want to pay for the commercial edition. Other tools I use when playing around at home (even at work) are pen and paper. I like being on the cutting edge ;-)
Thank you for all of your advice! It was really helpful. And interviewers really ask those canned questions about finding prime numbers and reversing linked lists? I already know how to solve a handful of those kinds of simple problems but I'll make sure to go over as much as I can before going to any interviews.
thanks!
[Head First design patterns](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/patterns/0596007124) (if any of those books didn't teach you them already). I wouldn't go into detail in all the technologies. Have a general overview of them all (eg. What X does, how to recognise X) and specialise 1-2 items. For example unless you plan to work with big data then you can skip Hadoop, beyond an overview. JEE / OSGi / SOA are all good areas. I'd also recommend to read up on how the JVM works. Comes in handy when you are dealing with memory issues. 
Eclipse for IDE. (J2EE edition, though I rarely use the tools, but the syntax highlighting helps a lot.) The m2e toolset is a must have and the JBoss tools can be helpful. For build management I use Maven. While I sometimes use m2e to do Maven tasks mostly I just use nano, gedit, or Eclipse's text editor to manage the pom files. For SCM I usually just use the command line interfaces. (I am an enterprise java developer and mostly I work with EE6 these days.) 
&gt;The only people who fight about JEE vs Spring are the pro-JEE folks. Wow... just wow... Spring folks singlehandedly *invented* this practice. I dare say that Spring rose to fame mostly because of their repeated attacks on (then) J2EE. Every news article about J2EE, every release note, every blog, every opportunity was grabbed to blacken J2EE and of course... surprise surprise Spring was there as the savior. If anything, please know your history.
Thank you so much for everything. &gt;Read a book on database design and normalization, maybe relational algebra. Can you give any recommendations on good books about databases for beginners to read?
Thanks for the book recommendation!
I've really wanted to read Head First Design Patterns before, thanks for the reminder, and thanks for all of your other advice!

Thanks for posting this. I'm a software engineering grad student trying to make a career change into development with little prior experience (other than tinkering as a hobby).
Do yourself a favor and don't use an IDE like eclipse if you are new in the game. You could develop bad habits because of the handholding that eclipse or other similar ide's provide. For a true beginner I recommend just starting with a simple syntax highlighting text editor like notepad++.
The responses in this thread are awesome. I'm a beginner, so I might be off, but I think this stuff should be in a FAQ somewhere.
What kind of bad habits?
Off the top of my head I think the worst is probably automatic code completion... type in System. and it shows you the available options or the automatic class generation. You can create a class and setup fields and eclipse will generate the entire class for you if you desire. These features are great if you already know what you are doing but can cause beginners to become lazy programmers. You will not have these features during interviews etc.
