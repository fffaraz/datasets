&gt; If you have problems with maven you are applying maven wrong. Poor products have to make excuses about how repeated must be someone else's fault. &gt; Overly simplified and MHO: The goal of maven is to create a stable project structure in which "mvn package" builds and packages your software. Which it fails to do without adding in additional plugins in order to onclude the jar files required to run. It's not the end of the world but it is unecessarily complicated, and the first commonly used plugin I tried was immediately buggy in creating a directory that could no be deleted, and could not be run a 2nd time without rebooting the machine. &gt; Sidenote: Oh and Gradle is still far from feature complete for enterprises: Still no decent (skinny) EAR support. This is a deal-breaker for large enterprises which have many large JavaEE apps. Honestly I'm not really sure that that means, I've not used gradle much at all. Kerping the jars in source control, then building with ant, that always worked very predictably and consistently.
I'm 3 days late for the party, but this blog's title seems like clickbait while the blog itself reads like an advertisement.

&gt; All of these are some of the reasons why the industry has moved towards web apps and away from desktop apps. There are signs development is moving back to thick clients for true RAD development without the bad underlying language (JavaScript or its ugly cousin TypeScript) and without a 148 tools to get the app done.
Contrary to what some are saying, I think it will be harder to go from java to C++. Yes, there are similarities; and yes, C++ can handle much of the memory management, but you can't entirely escape it (though I'm sure that's up for debate...). C++ is just far more complex and has many more nuances. Nonetheless, learn it in your spare time and I'm sure you'll be fine :)
Definitely agree with C++ =&gt; Java. Other way much harder.

I looked at the issues. I'm having a hard time understanding your comment "use JSON-P instead of GSON". Of course my understanding would be limited, but my assumption is that JSON-P is a pattern for serving cross domain requests and GSON is a JSON ser/deser library for Java. How does one interchange one for the other ?

But you are writing something 'from scratch' because you're looking for a JHipster for fat clients right? You still don't explain why that's not an option.
Maybe there's a naming coincidence, but the JSON-P I'm talking about is this one: [https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/](https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/) It is the standard Java API for JSON Processing and it was introduced in Java EE 7. &amp;#x200B; It is better to use that, even if your application is not Java Enterprise (the dependency in pom.xml will be compile time) and, in the future, if you decide to make it Enterprise (from JEE 7 up) you will simply switch the dependency to scope "provided". &amp;#x200B; And it's not only about your application, also many Java libraries are using that API :) Furthuremore JSON-P is well integrated with the JDK (provides APIs for parsing InputStream and Reader, for isntance) and is based itself on interfaces (you can make your objects JsonObject polymorphic, for instance, since JsonObject is an interface :) &amp;#x200B; If you are curious, see how we are using JSON-P in [https://www.github.com/amihaiemil/docker-java-api](https://www.github.com/amihaiemil/docker-java-api). All entities returned by the API are extending JsonObject themselves.

&gt; can you explain why/how your architecture doesn't permit a web based client Hate to break this to you but not everything works well as a web app. And the development stack for web apps is atrocious. The absolutely only reason web apps are popular is zero-deployment on the client side. There is no getting around the fact it has a leg up there over desktop apps. Web apps work fine for apps where reads vastly out number writes/deletes. For anything rich a desktop app is far superior to a web app no matter how many javascript libraries are used to update the text based DOM. Face it, the text based DOM was never meant to support rich-client apps and using it as such is one giant dirty-hack. 
Or you could buy your own license. A true professional should be more than willing to supply their own tools. First year is $149 I believe, then after a couple of years it goes down to $89/year.
In many professions employees are required to provide their own tools (hair dresser, carpenter, etc). Why should development be different? Bring your own toolset with you that makes you productive. It's the professional thing to do.

Just another update here, our first java11 distroless build is available: [https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/issues/236#issuecomment-458646248](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/issues/236#issuecomment-458646248)
I think JDK11 with JavaFX is very nice: https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulufx/ It would be nice if it also autoupdated itself.
Amazon OpenJDK looks promising as they said no-cost, performance &amp; security fixes and running in thousands of production servers. &amp;#x200B; It is a very strong statement to adapt to it. Thank you.
Thank you [/u/karianna](https://www.reddit.com/u/karianna). Our plan is to start with Amazon OpenJDK, because of their strong statement - no-cost, performance+security fixes and running in thousands of production servers. Also their brand name. I think we might switch to AdoptOpenJDK soon after we get comfortable with the support policy. I appreciate your contributions to the OpenJDK.
Cool! We are actually going to build / test / distribute Amazon at Adopt as well 🙂
Thanks a lot for this link, it's very interesting.
good read! tl;dr - it's not inefficient if you let JIT take its course... it's not optimized until after the first run.

Every time I think I’ve got a decent knowledge of Java I see a post like this and realize I know nothing. Great stuff!
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Ivy encourages Ant script spaghetti, that alone makes it bad.
Great to hear 👍🏻👌🏻
Been there, done that, had the trauma. You need to push build process improvements so that you can use a CI environment. Builds from an IDE are one sign that the company doesn't know how to build software professionally.

good stuff use final and/or constants wherever you can
Possibly the part where the author says it goes from 55 to 5 microseconds but it gives units in milliseconds for 100k iterations? That made me read twice. Nice post though, regardless
Thirded. I’ve also found this site to be super useful. https://www.mkyong.com/
Good post!!
Lmao wasn’t the conclusion of the post that final was the worst option? 
Anyone know of any tutes where I can have a bit of play with this?
Anyone can come up with a decent summary about what's going on?
It's a very thorough investigation, well done. I actually learned a Java 7 feature from your post —— the number literal can be separated by underscores.
Curious, would sprintf and the like be more optimizable if we replaced varargs with tuples?
Oops, that makes sense now. I just got confused!!! 
I prefer light, it makes the source code more easier to read.
I don’t think we’ll be getting tuples anytime soon, but value types could help to reduce the cost of varargs.
I work for a small company, we're all using Windows (most are Windows 7). We have virtual machine installed, so Ubuntu is also an option to use.
Personally: adoptopenjdk Professionally: we licensed Azul for our distributable I am sure reasons exist, but aside from the graal perf benefits (relative to openjdk), I personally can't think of any reason I'd use Oracle. 
Not sure why you're downvoted. Azul is legit.
Not sure which article you read, but from what I read in the linked article, it seems like the JIT is able to optimize the loop if the variable is final. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54405842/why-is-if-variable1-variable2-0-inefficient#comment95622483_54405842
`final` on local variables has no effect. Not only does it have no measurable effect, it has *no* effect. On fields, that's a different story.
Good one, I'll make this part clearer, thanks!
&gt; Not only does it have no measurable effect, it has no effect. Did you read the post? It made the loop about 4 times faster. 
Sounds like he wants to reinvent procedural macros but less powerful since restricted to a few methods. https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#function-like-procedural-macros
The bytecode is identical. You can see here: https://javap.yawk.at/#rNOg1C I don't know what the OP was measuring, but making a local variable final has no effect on bytecode and thus *no* effect on performance.
The bytecode is not identical. You can see with the actual example from SO: https://javap.yawk.at/#Xk9okk The variable declaration is the same but the final variable is actually inlined - it uses ldc2_w instead of lload
The SO post also shows that the JIT fixes everything when you let it - no need to worry so much about final. Having everything final by default/having the compiler apply effectively final rules automatically would seem like a niec solution though
the variable does not need to be declared as final to be optimized by the JIT like the first respone shows though
Kind of expected a deeper exploration of what makes it that slow. But liked the verdict: "Spring is doing much more work to support the wide range of general-purpose use-cases".
If you extract loop into method which receives final variable it is not optimized by JIT. Which is kinda concerning in scope of modern trend favoring small functions.
The byte code is not identical. https://javap.yawk.at/#2dDbQS Main difference is 19: bipush 100 // final or 19: iload_2 // not final
Yea you're right, it looks like it follows the same rules as for final fields wrt constant expressions (i.e. fold them in javac). The jit should do this easily as well though, so it's probably still an issue with the measurement.
What's the practical difference between an array and a tuple?
Why don't you do it?
I think for the basic and a little bit of advanced Java mechanics it is, but Minecraft modding uses specific mechanics, so yeah, but just for the basics.
you will learn language on basic level (how to write basic code structures, how to organize code etc) but then you will start to use minecraft libraries to write minecraft-specific things it is just like using any library/framework in any language - you are always learning something, but still you are learning this one specific library and you will need to learn another library to use it but DO start writing minecraft addons, you will learn real programming language and at any point you can leave minecraft and start writing another things still in the same language (and in the future, java programmers are needed practically everywhere and for good salary too)
Surely a time based cache has to look up the system time on every call? So caching a call to System.currentTimeMillis(); is always going to be slower.
Yes but that's actually knowledge of JIT. And no worries, the optimizations implemented in JIT are the result of years of implementing research papers etc. I think most Java devs shouldn't think about such things. Here are some slides for you [http://cr.openjdk.java.net/\~vlivanov/talks/2017\_Vectorization\_in\_HotSpot\_JVM.pdf](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~vlivanov/talks/2017_Vectorization_in_HotSpot_JVM.pdf)
Sounds useful, but I can't help thinking that in an ideal world there would be better ways to solve these types of problems. For example, the repeated parsing of the format string. Isn't solving cases like this this exactly what all the work on constant tracking is building to? Sure, this particular use-case would be troublesome since only one of the arguments to the method invocation is likely to be constant. At first glance you'd expect to have to rewrite the API to split the operation into separate invocations such that the first part can be isolated as a constant expression. Something like: String.formatter("formatString").apply(args); But couldn't the compiler feasibly do some of this work behind the scenes? Given a bit of a nudge on the declaration to indicate that it might be a useful optimisation: public static String format(@ProbablyConstant String formatString, Object... args) { ... } Can't we specialize the `format` method for each invocation with a constant format string and propagating the constant into the body of the specialised method? As for eliminating varargs boxing, surely there is *some* generalised way forward with Arrays 2.0 and Valhalla. Perhaps a case of compiling the method to be secretly generic, and specializing it over a generated ["tuple" class](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/valhalla-dev/2019-January/005357.html) which implements the tentatively-proposed `Array` interface? Then we can all benefit from these optimisations, not just whichever methods the VM implementers have deigned to intrinsify.
Probably they are referring to tuples which are flat / stack allocated. Valhalla will likely [providing for such types](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/valhalla-dev/2019-January/005357.html) to perform under-the-hood optimisations, but they are unlikely to be exposed at the language level according to current discussion.
One of my recent projects was running a private Minecraft server for fun with friends. I didnt learn to code Java, but I got experience using the language by creating basic anti-griefing plugins Search thesourcecode on youtube for very nicely planned out tutorials :)
Except A) there *is no* no time based cache here, and B) the point is not that for a trivial example the cache might be slower than calling the method every time, the point is that the default Spring Cache mechanism is considerably slower than a manually implemented straightforward cache.
Anything that keeps you motivated is good. Minecraft modding is a bit of a niche domain, but you'll also learn general concepts which will transfer to any domain.
But an array can also be 'allocated' on the stack so I don't see what difference it would make in this case, without other changes.
The key word there is "flat". That is, not only would the tuple be allocated on the stack but (some of) its contents would be too. An Object array just contains references. The array itself may exist on the stack but all its contents are on the heap, including primitives, which must be boxed. A "flattened tuple" in this context means allowing primitives to occur inline on the stack so as to remove the unnecessary pointer indirection for primitives. This will only become more significant when value types eventually land and more can be flattened. In fact, assuming a tuple would be modelled under the hood as some sort of synthetic class, for the tuple to be put onto the stack it would have to be a value type itself. To allow a tuple method argument to be allocated onto the stack we would need a generic method specialized on the type of the tuple. Generic specialization is also one of the primary goals of Valhalla.
TLDR; I've mentioned [this multiple times when people say spring proxying and annotations are slow](https://spring.io/blog/2007/07/19/debunking-myths-proxies-impact-performance/) - Spring proxy classes add ~250-500ns per method call. If you need to squeeze out an extra 100-200ns per transaction, I would be very wary about littering my code with Spring-wired AOP annotations in the first place (caching, logging, authorization, transactional, etc). You'll probably want to use aspectj bytecode weaving or forego the annotations altogether and roll your own. 
&gt; The array itself may exist on the stack but all its contents are on the heap, including primitives, which must be boxed. But the boxes could also be 'allocated' on the stack, without any indirection or using the heap.
Will there be a new release of your book? Last edition is 2016. Thanks for your tutorials Vlad.
One data point: I'm aware of one very large company which already has a Red Hat support contract for RHEL, and they are planning to get JDK support via Red Hat as part of this support contract.
Static values should not be variables, always use static final. There are few exceptions to this rule, such as the Singleton pattern. I prefer using static constants for a lot of things, often I have values and lists that I need to use in many locations. There's nothing wrong with that approach. I use static methods when the method is really more of a function, it doesn't depend on state at all. The benefit here is that its easier to test, you don't have to do any setup other than the inputs, and you know that the outputs don't depend on anything else. There's absolutely nothing wrong with static values and methods, they're very useful when used correctly, but avoid using static fields to store runtime values. 
&gt; In my opinion, it’s OK to use static as long as there’s no better way to do the same task with instance variable The problem is, there is almost always a better way to do things with instance variables. For example, if your program has some global state, create a `State` class/object and give that to consumers using (simple) dependency injection (I'm not writing about dependency injection frameworks and other complicated stuff, just pass a reference to your `State` for example in t he cosntructor) The only time when it makes sense to use static variables is for constants (essentially `static final` variables of immutable classes)
Well... thank you! About storing runtime values in them - I don’t do that, it actually didn’t even come to my mind. For the future, why is it a bad idea?
Programming is not a math of "either 1 or 0". Nothing is 100% correct, nothing is 100% incorrect. Very cautiously using static variable is fine, though overusing it is really bad (why bad? One is that it can make your system coupling tightly). You can always dependency inject your variable so not to make it static. But sometimes certain variable may be used everywhere globally, such as an instance of the whole application, then I may make it static. In my own system design, I will be not unhappy if there is a global static variable called someApp (though it's usually a singleton than a static variable), but no more other global static stuff. 
Why do you want to learn Java?
Arrays must be homogeneous in the layout of their elements, such that an index can be multiplied by the width of the element type to produce an offset into the array. You can't just have some elements as references to heap objects and other elements as flat objects occurring inline. You'd need to store type information for all the elements to know how to interpret them when you indexed in, and even to know the memory location to index in at, since they'd all be different widths. And that's not an array anymore, that's a tuple. As for allocating *boxes* on the stack, that makes even less sense, as once you've solved the problem of the heterogeneous shape of the array (i.e. by making it into a tuple) there's no longer any need for boxing, that's the whole point! For the record, it can never be possible to put objects of normal reference types directly on the stack in Java. What would happen if you then assigned the stack-allocated object instance to a heap variable (thereby putting a pointer into stack memory onto the heap)? Eventually the stack frame containing the instance would be popped off, after which point the memory could be obliterated at any moment and all remaining references to the Object would just be pointing to random junk. And you can't just defensively copy them because Objects have identity. That's why we need the concept of value types to facilitate stack allocation of data, hence the Valhalla project.
Ok, I didn’t know about State class... thanks!
It makes the code non-thread safe. Only one thread can call your code at the same time. A second caller will set the static variable while the first caller is still using it. You often get away with that in the prototyping face but you'll find out later when your code is being deployed that it's unstable in multithreaded applications and you'll have to rewrite the whole thing.
&gt; Arrays must be homogeneous in the layout of their elements, such that an index can be multiplied by the width of the element type to produce an offset into the array. Not when they have been 'allocated' on the stack (meaning scalar replaced) they don't. &gt; You can't just have some elements as references to heap objects and other elements as flat objects occurring inline. Yes you can! That works in the JVM today. &gt; You'd need to store type information for all the elements Yes the compiler does this in the IR. &gt; As for allocating boxes on the stack, that makes even less sense But this works in the JVM today! &gt; it can never be possible to put objects of normal reference types directly on the stack in Java The JVM already does it! &gt; What would happen if you then assigned the stack-allocated object instance to a heap variable Then it's moved to the heap at that point. &gt; And you can't just defensively copy them because Objects have identity. Again, move them to the heap when identity is needed but not before. I don't think you've got all the facts about how Java already does 'stack allocation' (scalar replacement) of objects.
Sure. Static variables are the best way to do some thing (i.e. loggers in most cases are static). But! There are things that better to be injected (using DI - Dependency Injection). Why? Because it will allow you to change all things without changing code. For example: 1) you are using database A, but found that it have poorly performance for hierarchical data. You want to change it to something else, but with static variables you will need to change all static variables to new implementation. (It worth to mention that DI may be replaced with "Service locator"-pattern) 2) let's imagine that you are making video game. It's fun, but you realized that it's too easy for some players or too hard for others. You want to make different difficulty levels for all players to enjoy your game. If all "difficulty variables" are static - you will need to change it depending on difficulty settings that your user wants. It will automatically make your static variables not final, that will add another "point of potential failure" (i.e. accidentally updated one of the variables). With DI you can create different difficulty presets (i.e. normal enemy hp: X1, enemy damage X1, easy: enemy hp: x0.5, enemy damage: x0.75, etc.) and inject them depending on the difficulty setting. Tl:;dr: Static variables are fine, unless you can separate them to different object and it seems reasonable. Upd: There are another example of usage static variables - it's utility classes(classes with public static final variables and with private constructor).
Well, you don't need to name it `State`. That's just a very generic name i chose because I have no idea what you would need to store. But something along those lines is usually helpful.
Thanks for writing it down like this!
Oh, I see, first I thought it’s a part of some library... my bad!
Beyond the multithreaded reasons already mentioned, it can just easily lead to unexpected behavior. A static variable can potentially be used across many methods or even classes. If the value is a primitive then you only have to worry about the value being different, but it it's an object, such as a list, then you also have to worry about the reference changing. Best practice is to never set or mutate static variables, you just can't reasonably track what effects it'll have. Treat static fields as constants, name then with CONSTANT_CASE. If you follow those simple rules, its pretty safe and pretty standard to use. I hardly write a class without some static fields, unless it's just a data class.
I would start with just learning the language itself. Write a Hello World, Write file reader/writer, Write a socket demo, Write something that calculates some math problem. Once you have done simple examples, and feel more or less confident, then you can try to do some mods, again starting with examples.
As long as you find it so. Minecraft modding require to learn Minecraft Forge API, that may be too complicated, and that can lead you to "java is too hard" opinion. So my answer will be: if you have fun with it - it's good. If it's too hard then maybe you should start with easier projects.
I will give that a shot. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing your view.
Yes, I heard of Azul, their cost comes very close to Oracle, for our ecosystem. I could not justify their support policy with the free version, to use it in our PROD servers. I could use Corretto's support policy easily :) Thanks for sharing your view.
Any supporting article?
Ah I see what you're saying. Well sure, the *JIT* can already manage stuff like this, but that's not the same thing! The proposal is about providing these optimisations out of the gate with javac, which is more difficult. The JIT doesn't have to worry about binary backwards-compatibility, conforming to class file format, separate compilation, etc. Very naively, if we wanted to perform something equivalent to scalar replacement at *compile time* that would mean the compiler would need to emit a new signature for each invocation, which of course is silly as invocations may exist in separate compilation units to the declaration of the method. I maintain that the path to facilitating this class of optimisation *statically* would have to involve generic specialisation of the method, and the obvious carrier for the specialisation type would be something like a tuple.
&gt; There are few exceptions to this rule, such as the Singleton pattern. And even then, the singleton itself needs to be immutable or thread-safe.
I was born into a family of non-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, "if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya." "Yes, pa," I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework. "Y'all hitting that yeet?" he would seeth. "No, pa," I would answer. "Good." He would then walk out the room and shout, "If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'." It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake. I would swallow my pride. "No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa." As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet. One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air. I breathed in. "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!" My father burst from my closet. "I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that yeet, nibba," he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me. I haven't hit that yeet since. Until today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one. With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone. "Yeet," I spake. Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest. "Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' yeet at my funeral?" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me. "Not so fast, pa." I grabbed his hand. "Yaint thumpin' no mo'." My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. "The student becomes the teacher," he said. "The student becomes the yeetcher," I corrected him.
As soon as I saw who was asking this question (arrays vs tuples) I knew it was a trap :-)
No, just personal knowledge.
Absolutely: business logic validation in the business logic layer. Validation will exist at other levels: for example, if you're using [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC and you have a DateTime field, it's going to automatically reject it if you supply a string that can't be parsed to a DateTime. And then there's the client side validation which is for UX friendliness only.
Avoidance of static data is related to the simple principle of "spooky action at distance is bad". For public static values that can change, you have to worry about this kind of questions: * Who changes them? * When, and using which thread? * Is it thread safe to begin with? If not, what locks are required? * How do I make sure that all related state variables always get updated coherently, possibly also atomically? Object orientation is fundamentally about managing the relationship between the data and the code that operates on the data. At its most reductionistic level, you should only have public API, and private state within the object, which is never exposed. Public static variables are the exact opposite because they expose the data without any methods, in principle in uncontrolled, thread-unsafe way without enforcing consistency to the way these variables are to be updated or what invariants should be held when they are updated. That being said, you can create public and static stuff with instance variables, too, for instance through the Singleton pattern. Foo.getInstance().getBar() and Foo.getInstance().setBar(5) are just public static variables disguised into instances. So it's not so much about seeing the `static` keyword, but more about how the stuff actually behaves and gets used. The important exception made in GP post is that static final is actually fine, but only if the static final values are immutable data, primitive values, or classes implementing thread-safe methods. The key thing is that it can never change, so you don't really have to worry about who accesses it and when, because there is no spooky action at distance.
Array creation might be a good candidate: Code like: new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 }; has to manually write to the array which creates large bytecode for large arrays. If you used invokedynamic to dispatch to something like ` MethodHandles.identity(type.returnType()) .asCollector(type.returnType(), type.parameterList().size())` you could save on bytecode.
I love IDEA but recently I found it's too slow in running Java code...when I make a demo to students practicing MOOC Java Part1 exercises, NetBeans is much much faster than that of IDEA, I literally moved to NetBeans for MOOC. Besides that, normal run Java code or build Maven projects, it seems also slower than before, even I've made some basic tunnings to JVM options. Anyone had similar feelings? I've got a T540P, 16GB RAM, a 250GB Samsung SSD. Running NetBeans is just blazing fast.
Would be interesting to see comparisons with Guava Cache and Caffeine
Dude the github repository page sucks. Not found.
Probably is [that](https://github.com/dribbleware1/TinyFerdinand). Is the only repo of the user
You can disagree with it. It is wrong. I've seen it. Multiple times. There is no way it can be as full featured, as well maintained and to the quality as Spring. Your company wants you working on value-add not frameworks.
good read. thanks!
That is because Spring Boot is an Opinionated framework. The opposite of what you want.
Appreciate the perspective and I agree. I left the company soon after I posted this.
Is the link broken? 
In the youtube you cannot click the github link to a valid place. /u/brainspinner has pointed out the correct one. Meanwhile, how about add some stuff that the hero can kill some monsters? Just see the guy with armor while without hair simply walking in the world is a little bit lonely and boring, man :)
Yeah I just updated the link, should be working now thanks to /u/brainspinner for getting the correct one for me XD Theres a lot more planned and in the works unfortantly due to the amount of time I can dedicate to it some weeks it's just going to take some time but animals and monsters are coming soon!! 
I think you're describing some variant of the Context pattern there.
But those stacks are full of them. They add up. Still your point stands that this might not be the best attack point. A profiler is.
Context and DI are related concepts. A context is usually a parameter to a method/interface, with dependency injection you set the dependency usually in the constructor or with a setter (or a framework). Also a Context often contains random assorted data while with DI you usually inject an implementation with methods that are very specific to the actual task.

You'de be surprised. In a world before Javascipt, SOAP was doing the job quite well. Validating that some message sent too your app is sane is a very useful feature. It can even be quite fast. Alas, people moved to json because it was the new shiny. 
Singleton instances? That's a valid use of static non-final variables
yes, `static final` is an essential feature of Java
I'm not not sure how things like 401k work (I'm based in EU), but it's pretty normal that once you start contracting, you're treated as a separate business entity so your rate needs to reflect all of those perks that are not there anymore.
This is very common for contractors. My advice is try to transition into a non-contractor job as soon as you're able. The higher pay is nice, but if the company you're doing work for (contrast with the company that actually pays you) likes you, they'll often be willing to hire you for as much or more than what you're earning as a contractor, with the benefit of also getting your insurance benefits, vacation days, 401k, etc. However, it probably won't save you from having to go 90 days without company insurance, since pretty much every company will try to take advantage of you for as long as they are legally allowed to. COBRA (or other transition period insurance plans) can be extremely expensive, so try not to stay on them any longer than you need to. At $23000 more, that'll *probably* offset the extra insurance costs (depends if your plan covers only you, or also your family), but if you can get that $23000 more *and* get subsidized employer insurance, that's just flat-out better. Also, the lack of vacation days can suck. The company you work for will almost certainly have company-wide vacation days, like federal holidays and such, and being unable to work will mean a dip in pay. Contractor work is fine in short bursts, especially as a means to get your foot in the door at a new company. Just try not to do it for too long.
Much java 
Great job! Keep going dude~
I'm shocked how people here talk about singletons... Please please please, never use the Java singleton pattern (the one with static variable or the one with enum wich is kind of a hack but easy to code). Why do I recommand to stay away from singleton and static variables ? Because as soon as you will have a non-trivial program you will change the state of your singleton. You will do it in multiple places. You will loose all common sense because it seems too easy... And one day, you'll realize that you have created a gigantic spaghetti plate and you have no idea of the logic making things work. The program will work, but you will not know how... until it stops working and you'll have to dig in this horrible spaghetti plate. Believe me I've inherited a codebase with Singletons all over the place. So as soon as you're not alone on the project, as soon as it's not trivial anymore, what seemed easy at first (using Singletons) will come and bite you. hard. And any static variable is some kind of Singleton in disguise. Only constants (un-mutable final variables such as String, int, double but not objects wrapping a mutable state) pose absolutely no problem. For now I've talked only about the singleton implementation using the static keyword. Because we can talk about singletons "in a given context" (such but not limited to Spring's Singletons): in a given "context", a singleton is when there is a single instance of something. Technically you implement it by... only instancing the object once ! It seems too simple but think about it: why would you instantiate it twice if you are already passed an instance of it in your constructor if you declare to need it. Yes I'm talking about the dependency injection pattern which is a very good patern. And if you have multiple "contexts" (the same application running multiple times in the same jvm) then nothing prevents you from having multiple instances of a singleton as long as it is unique in the context. &amp;#x200B; Stay away from static mutable variables. Please
Let’s say I want some unified logging. For that I would use static voids or singleton instance. What would you do?
Common And Good Static Uses: - constant variables - static utility methods - If there's no other way - shared data between threads with proper synchronization. Threading is always error prone and should be avoided if possible - but sometimes it's the only way something can be done. Basically if you don't need threading I don't think you ever need to have static variables except constants. 
I'd be fine with that if the toolbox was well designed and less obtrusive. Sure if you're managing multiple installs and constantly update it'll be better. But everytime I've tried to use it the UI has been mediocre and the workflow bad. Not to mention most times you want to tweak something about your install it won't be supported.
You're getting insurance as a contractor period? Be happy. 
What has been already posted .. plus -- IF AND ONLY IF the 90 day thing is a sticking point with you -- getting hired is a negotiation, no matter what they tell you. If they want you bad enough you can ask the moon - but again IF AND ONLY IF it's worth it to you to have to walk away from the situation if they don't budge. The "90 day" delay is specifically designed to save the HR department from enrolling and unrolling new employees who don't work out and are fired. If you're a contractor that is being turned into a FTE, you can argue that the 90 day thing doesn't apply since they know you're a good employee and you leaving or getting fired in the first 90 days isn't a likely scenario. 
Real World example. We recently acquired a code base using MS SQLServer. We are an Oracle shop, so we had to change to Oracle for integration, while keeping the original to work as it had previously. Now, if they were using some kind of ORM library with a DB driver, we could just swap out the DB specific portions. Instead they had a class full of static methods that used JDBC yo do the CRUD stuff. It took 3 weeks to migrate all the queries and test them for consistency. Luckily there were only about 100 queries. Oh, and we have to do Postgres as well. Luckily we will be moving to something more standard soon.

assuming that you're in the USA, are you really a contractor, ie get payed on a 1099, or are you a w2 employee for a company that contracts you out to another company ? 
It would be as an actual contractor. I'd get paid hourly and have a 1099. 
Thanks for the support :)

&gt; Builds from an IDE are one sign that the company doesn't know how to build software professionally Agreed. I have written a python script to move all the projects into maven format and created pom's for this. However the arch./cofounder feels that after 6 years of not having a build system his opinion is bazel will be the best fit. O.O 4 months ago I won the arg. to use maven(team has a better understanding, tooling, etc) but then I see he is using his *supposed* contacts at google to assist him getting a bazel build working. Busy looking around ATM, too much dim wittery happening for my taste
Jeez, just use RxJava. More composable, handles backpressure, and parallel/serial is the caller's choice.
You mean when adapting the code from SO using JMH for measuring? Or how did you test that? I'm asking because from what ive come to understand about the current JIT implementations they can and do perform inlining.
 The best way to learn to mod a game is to tackle the problem head on. 1. Start with a beginner java course so that when you see code, you can at least interpret it at a basic level. 2. Read the set up your java environment like the modders. [Basic Modding - Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Basic_Modding) 3. Download and rip apart the simplest Minecraft mod you can find. ([Furniture Mod | Minecraft Mods](http://www.minecraftmods.com/furniture-mod/)) 4. Take specific Java online lessons if necessary, if not just modify existing mods until you are comfortable with the code 5. Build your own.
That is completely untrue. Making a local variable final can even lead to differences in \*behavior\*, I. E. Change the semantics of the program. Granted, this usually only happens in specially crafted examples and is not something you would should ever come across I regular code, but there \*is\* a difference. Obviously, I'm talking about programs that are valid Java both with and without the final modifier, not just that some code doesn't compile because you put/didn't put final.
What's today's advice with using constants (final static) in Java? Do people consciously put a constant behind a static accessory method to avoid inlining at compile time and potentially leading to obscure bugs when compiling stuff separately/incrementally? I think the JLS even said something about it being potentially dangerous unless something actually a constant as in the mathematical constant PI. Or do you you assume that you're rebuilding everything g often enough for this never to be an issue?
Advanced books are no longer being written. Most books available now are just lazy authors rephrasing the javadocs, without ever explaining anything. It's a shitty situation.
Yes you're right: I'd use slf4j as static variable as everybody else. In most cases that's what we do. But logging is kinda special. It's not your domain model, your code... In my first message I forgot to say that Singletons kill the testability of an app.
Here's a completely silly but it is one: 1. **final** **int** i = 65; 2. [System](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=allinurl%3Adocs.oracle.com+javase+docs+api+system).out.println(**true**? i : 'a'); [https://ideone.com/ae6CsN](https://ideone.com/ae6CsN) [https://ideone.com/5RhA8J](https://ideone.com/5RhA8J) 
Yes, read the first example of the answer. There is your summary.
Also keep in mind that because this is knowledge of JIT and not Java, they are implementation details. They can be different on different JVMs, even between different versions of the same JVM. In the end, the important thing is measuring correctly. Note how the poster in SO uses JMH (@Benchmark annotations etc) to measure the code, because the JIT can subvert what you think you are testing. I don't really know much about it myself except that it's a subtle art. This will bring you further rather than trying to rationalize and predict what your code is doing based on some partial understanding of how the JIT works, especially since there is no one "JIT".
Yes, the same constant expression folding rules apply as for final fields. Do note, though, that at that point the variable is not actually used anymore; it is folded at compile time (not observable with locals, but observable with fields). This does not apply to non-constant-expressions for final locals, which are truly exactly the same as non-final locals. This is not the case in the OP.

Is there any website/portal which tell us about what are the new technologies are being used these days? e.g. OWASP, Kubernets, JDK11. &amp;#x200B;
The problem with that State pattern is that it becomes a kitchen sink of everything ever and makes it difficult to modularize and separate concerns. State becomes a point of high coupling. IMO it's better to just bite the bullet and use dependency injection whether you do it manually or with a DI library.

And this is exactly why our Java-based application ships without Java
This article is incorrect. All commercial features have now been open-sourced, and are now available in OpenJDK. And if you don’t want to pay for a license, you don’t have to — just use OpenJDK builds or builds from other vendors.
&gt; tricking Nobody has ever been tricked into accidentally using commercial features. You've always have to explicitly enable them, it is very clear. But that is moot as there no longer are any commercial features. And if any half-serious commercial enterprise is downloading and deploying Java without noticing the gigantic warning on the download page or making a quick, customary check of the terms they're idiots.
Searched for "OpenJDK", could not find even though there is an "Actions to Take" section. I discount this article.

Thanks. Didn't know this book existed. Seems good. Going to buy it.
I posted a brief comment (DannyB) mentioning: 1. Open JDK 2. Its open source license 3. Links (posted above) where to download Open JDK prebuilt binaries and complete source code We'll see if that information appears in the article's comments. &amp;#x200B;
The article is talking about Java SE which a lot of people and businesses use without knowing about these licensing issues. The article is therefore correct.
OpenJDK builds are Java SE...
Great post. I’m just getting back into java and learned a ton... I really appreciate the links to the java docs for the various concepts. 
the article specifically talks about oracle's java. so, it is correct. it doesn't (though it should) mention other java distributions. The "Actions to Take" section, while also correct, it is woefully short and lacking critical information (such as use open jdk). so, the article is correct, albeit light on information.
as 1099 you're responsible for your health care and the full FICA (on a w2, the employer pays half). without knowing your current salary can't know if the $23,000 is a win (there are online calculators, google for "w2 1099 equiv" or something like that) the big win with 1099 is that you can write off business expenses. so if you have a side project or hobby that you'd like to turn into a business and are making more money than you need to live, this allows you to invest in it with pre-tax money for this reason, i've been trying to find 1099 work, unfortunately unsuccessfully so far. how did you find this opportunity ? 
You are welcome. I already bought it, but unfortunately I didn't have time to read it so far
I see what you mean. I wish they would have mentioned it. If more people learn that free builds are available from OpenJDK and other vendors, there will be less confusion amongst companies and users.
i'd argue that 1099 work for a java dev is distinct from the larger cs field one of the prime advantages of java is that it enables huge teams to work together productively over longer timeframes, and at least in my city this represents close to 100% of the java work. and the rules for 1099 work make this difficult (i believe upwork limits engagements to something like 3 months) java's an amazing language (esp 8 and later) and great for smaller projects, but building up that market is a bit of a chicken and an egg problem 
Technically... yes. Legally no. [If you pass TCK](https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/time-to-look-beyond-oracles-jdk.html) you can only describe OpenJDK build as "Java SE compatible".
OpenJDK is also Oracle's Java.
I understand. The point I was trying to make is that Oracle JDK builds and OpenJDK builds are now the same, minus a few differences, such as licensing.
&gt; OpenJDK is also Oracle's Java. huh? no. i mean, oracle's java is based on opendjk, to which they add their thing, sure, but opendjk is not oracle's java. it was. many moons ago, sure. when the dinosaurs were walking the earth. not today.
Uhm, we don't "add our thing." We develop OpenJDK and [distribute it under two different licenses](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later). Other companies [also contribute](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/building-jdk-11-together), but as Oracle does at least 80-90% of the work, OpenJDK is still Oracle's Java.
the differences (cosmetic or otherwise) are what differentiates openjdk from oracle's jdk. sorry, opendjk is no longer oracle's, it's community's. at the moment oracle provides 90% of the work, sure, but that can change in the future. that will most likely change in the future.
Well, we're always happy to have others contribute and wish they'd contribute more. But as of now, the OpenJDK project is run by Oracle. See the logo on the bottom? http://openjdk.java.net/

Please excuse my ignorance on this issue. We are a non profit organization and we uninstalled Java 8 from all of our workstations so we would be in compliance with Oracle's new java licensing rules. Our finance staff now realizes that they need java to use an Key Bank uploader tool. We tried to make the tool work with OpenJDK but were unsuccessful probably because it requires Java webstart. My question is, are we required to purchase a subscription for Java 8 to use with a third party tool? Our organization does do some software development using java but my question is only in regards to using Java 8 with third party software like the Key Bank tool. Thanks in advance for your help.
lol. ok. it's yours if you say so. you gave it and you can certainly take it away. and also you can go an molest users with a broom if they even fart in the wrong jdk's direction. jesus, what have we become. 
You might do better to post this question as a new discussion to give a bit more visibility. It seems there is [at least one open-source Web Start implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcedTea#IcedTea-Web) -- I've never used Web Start in any form so I can't comment on its suitability, but it appears that it does at least support Java 8.
Will they make videos available online for free after?
They have in the past, so I would assume so. They were posted on YouTube in the past.
**No surveys, no job offers!** Such content will be removed without warning.
Why molest? Oracle has completed the open sourcing of Java, and anyone is free to build and distribute the code we develop. But what have we become when we can't even acknowledge and credit major open source contributions? If you can credit a company for building and hosting binaries, why not credit the company that develops and contributes the code?
Thanks. I will start a new discussion. 
Feels weird seeing Estonian `.ee` domain used as part of the site name.
How long does a code review take with this checklist?
the molesting part happens when one is using the Oracle JDK confusing the "Oracle OpenJDK" with "Oracle JDK". If your lawyers catch you doing that, you wish molesting was the way out. i am not saying don't acknowledge. but this is just taking it way out there. to me it looks straight up evil, deceiving. Google doesn't come and sues your ass if you use chrome itself, oracle does. so there is that. the distinction between the two stops at the features of both, not at the legal repercussions. and your adamant stance that **it's Oracle's** , **it's ours, we write 90%** is just ... sigh. you're just a dev i hope, not a project manager, but odds are that this is what the management is instilling as well. My point of view: It's openjdk, tell people to use openjdk. Oh yes, mention hat OpenJDK is developed by many contributors, out of which Oracle is the largest, but nothing more. Hell, do you mention on your Oracle's Linux page that Oracle Linux is 99.999999% developed by RedHat?

My goal wasn't to mark territory (and I speak only for myself, not my employer), just correct an erroneous comment by you that was particularly misleading, and Oracle doesn't "sue your ass" for using Java. I don't ascribe virtue to corporations (and if I did, neither Oracle nor Google would come within miles from "virtuous"), but I do try to point out when someone makes wrong and/or misleading statements. And if anyone here was deceiving anyone, it was you doing the deceiving.. 
You said: "openjdk is also Oracle's Java". So, not community jdk, but Oracle's. If that's not marking territory then what is? Every single sentence was :it's our, not yours. And "Oracle doesn't sue your ass"? Have you read the license? You can use it to develop, shall you deploy it they come running. Are you that brainwashed? Come on.

I'm afraid you've misunderstood me. I wasn't saying "it's Oracle's not yours", I was responding to your comment that the article is accurate because it pertains only to Oracle's Java, as opposed to... whose? &gt; Are you that brainwashed? Not so much brainwashed as literate. Oracle's JDKs are distributed under two licenses. As the Oracle JDK [download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) clearly states: &gt; * **Oracle Customers and ISVs targeting Oracle LTS releases:** Oracle JDK is Oracle's supported Java SE version for customers and for developing, testing, prototyping or demonstrating your Java applications. &gt; * **End users and developers looking for free JDK versions:** [Oracle OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/11/) offers the same features and performance as Oracle JDK under the [GPL license](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html). And the Oracle OpenJDK [download page](https://jdk.java.net/11/) also clearly says: &gt; This page provides production-ready open-source builds of the Java Development Kit, version 11.0.2, an implementation of the Java SE 11.0.2 Platform under the GNU General Public License, version 2, with the Classpath Exception. &gt; Commercial builds of JDK 11.0.2 from Oracle under a [non-open-source license](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/javase-license.html), for a wider range of platforms, can be found at the [Oracle Technology Network](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 
Thanks! :)
&gt; as opposed to... whose? OpenJDK, the community's Java, to which you took offence with, because, god dammit is Oracle's java. all of it. unlike all software though, oracle (out of habit, inertia, whatever), has made their jdks licences extremely confusing and extremely easy to fall into the trap of "i can use this on the server, after all we've been doing it for a decade now" . and that was fine until 11. now it isn't. and the article is certainly not referring to open jdks, aka, the other java, the free one. 
Oh, I understood what you *meant*, but as Oracle offers Java under a free license, and most others offering free Java also offer essentially the *same* software under the *same* license, saying that the article is true because it's about Oracle's Java is not only wrong but misleading. Maybe the new licensing situation is confusing, but I think everyone would agree it's much better than before, now that Oracle has open sourced all of the JDK and it is completely free -- whether you choose Oracle's free builds or others' -- both as in beer and as in speech.
&gt; it's better than the old one except when you take a wrong step and the devil makes you install the oracle's jdk (how the fuck do you call the non free one then?) on the server. then you're fucked and the lawyers have the right to molest you, after they took your first born. yeah, i don't think it's the same thing as before. but it is what it is.
Goodness, so many bad things to avoid, perhaps this problem is not well suited to the language.
I think that if the devil makes you do things, then licenses and even lawyers may not be your biggest concerns. But I agree that if Oracle open sources some widely popular and essential piece of software and the response, even if it's only from a few people, is "OMG you're coming for my babies," then we can do better at communication.
Ceci n'est pas un checklist
The answer is that you can continue to use JDK 8 (a.k.a. Java 8) that you download from Oracle for free, indefinitely. The license that it is supplied under is still the Oracle BCL. The change of license only affects JDK 11 and later. As long as you don't use any of the commercial features like Flight Recorder or Mission Control (unlikely) you are fine. What you do need to consider, though, is that the last free public update for JDK 8 from Oracle was released last week. The fact that you use web start limits your options of using an OpenJDK build (as you found) because this is not included in OpenJDK. Here is a very useful post from Sharat Chander of Oracle that explains this all in a bit more detail: [https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-java-se-releases-faq](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-java-se-releases-faq)
Whilst it is correct that features like Flight Recorder, Mission Control and application class data sharing have been contributed to the OpenJDK, this only applies to JDK 11 and later. If you want to continue to use JDK 8, those features are still covered by the previous license and therefore require you to pay to use them. For users who still need Java Web Start, this is not included in the OpenJDK and so alternative distributions that are built from OpenJDK will not include this.
OpenJDK builds are a superset of Java SE. As an example, OpenJDK includes the Nashorn scripting engine, which is not part of the Java SE specification. As another poster stated, just building OpenJDK source does not make it Java SE. To be compliant with the specification it is necessary to pass all tests of the TCK for the relevant JSR.
it's free for development, and oracle states that as such. it's a no brainer that odds are the the developer would install the same jdk he used to develop the thing onto the server. yes yes yes, the licence. we should all be lawyers. but we aren't and we don't want to be. the licence is never read by the vast majority of people, developers included. it's a trap, and oracle knows it. it is why it was designed like this.
Be careful how you use the term 'support'. AdoptOpenJDK is quite clear that they do not offer support in the traditional sense (i.e. someone to call). This is also the case of anyone using Amazon's Corretto (outside of AWS). One critical part of alternative JDK distributions is how (and if) they provide access to updates. Oracle is not contributing updates to OpenJDK repos of versions that it no longer provides public updates to. This means both JDK 8 and JDK 11 repos will receive no more updates from Oracle. Backporting from JDK 12, 13, etc will be required in future for these releases.
Yes, thank you for mentioning this!
Full disclosure, I work for Azul. I assume for your situation you have a small number of servers. For larger enterprises, the difference in cost between Zulu Enterprise and Oracle is quite substantial (we are cheaper).
Yes, I picked the wrong word. My intention was that OpenJDK includes Java SE. Thank you for the clarification!
No, it is not. [Here's a slide](https://youtu.be/MFfTqUQxFTs?t=884) from a talk by a Java product manager that has been shown in virtually every Java conference in the past year. And [this](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later) is a post by yet another product manager. It's been presented more prominently than any of the new Java features. If developers don't follow conferences and official blogs and social media, and then also don't read prominent notices on the download page, they are being negligent, not entrapped.
Just take this code and extract loop into method. Even if there is only one call with constant it wan't be optimized
They are negligent sure. But I don't believe you when you say: oh we're just poor communicators. Not Oracle. This is one place where maliciousness can be assumed where incompetence would do.
Of course, because while Google just directs children to conspiracy theories, and Facebook subverts elections and sells your data, Oracle has come up with an ultimate evil plan: open source Java, tell everybody about it, put bright warnings and in this way trap all of those poor innocent souls who miss the sirens and the signs and climb over the fence to jump into a hole so deep that they would need to pay $25 a month per server to get out from. Diabolical.
It's what some people said about .io at first too.
I am using https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj , a well maintained project with nice API. Supports ssh, scp and sftp. 
I am very not happy to use their software and I avoid it as much as reasonable. But their behavior doesn't excuse yours. Whataboutims .... Is the wrong way to approach the problem. 
I looked at that, but couldn't find any info on how to use it with a corporate proxy. Found stuff saying "yeah we added proxy support" but nothing on how to actually use it.

99% of people wouldn't know that relates to Estonia.
Actually sshtools is a wrapper around jsch, as i found jsch wasn't really user friendly. I tried to make it easier to do ssh/sftp.
&gt; **Now the audit process is looking not just at traditional software licenses, but also at the use of Java. What strategy is Oracle using for auditing Java?** &gt; &gt; They’re approaching Java differently right now. It’s taken them about ten years to try to monetize Java. Oracle’s being really smart about this, because they’re not auditing customers to get them to buy Java, but they’re worrying customers to get them to buy Java. &gt; &gt; **Can you explain the vulnerability that customers have with respect to Java?** &gt; &gt; Oracle made many changes in how they distribute and support Java. It changed this month. You use a version of Java, the current version of Java, Oracle will support that version, quote-unquote, for free for six months. **After six months, if you want support for that version, you have to pay for it. So customers are left with two choices: either get a license from Oracle and pay for support, or run a version of Java for free that’s unsupported.** So if there’s a hole or a patch or an update or something security-wise, they’re running without that. So technically, it’s possible to run without that license and not to pay Oracle. OSRACLE One Super Rich Asshole Called Larry Ellison
I didn't honestly try it myself yet, but I think that walking through the list when you are already familiar with it and evaluating if each item applies to a patch (after you have already read the patch) should take less than 10 minutes. A review of a non-trivial patch involving concurrency should take at least one hour (for some patches much, much more). So reviews are slowed down by 15% in exchange of better quality of the code (including readability and maintainability, that will pay off later in terms of time). I think it's a good deal for those with "investor mindset" to the development of a long-term project.
Very complete checklist. Thanks
Fuck everything about Oracle, we as a industry need to dump Java and dump it hard.
Luckily this seems not to affect the JVM? I don't feel good about that in the long run though.
Thanks for the feedback! I completely agree, as should be clear from the article, but it seems that most frameworks out there make it very easy to put validation logic in the infrastructure layer. While that is not wrong per se, I think there's a better place (the business logic layer), especially when having multiple entry points into the system.
Ah, are you still doing the thing where you repost a subreddit's links on your webpage, not even changing titles and all, while adding your own ads?
No. OpenJDK continues to be patched and maintained by community members including but not limited to Amazon, RedHat, IBM, and Azul. 
This doesn’t even impact OpenJDK.
Java needs to dump Oracle. Amazon should just buy it, with whole developer team working on OpenJDK and be done. They have Larry wet dreams amount of money.
If i had gold i would give it to you
&gt; So customers are left with two choices: either get a license from Oracle and pay for support, or run a version of Java for free that’s unsupported. Or (as articles of this kind often fail to point out), run a version of Java with paid support from someone else (Azul, IBM, Red Hat, etc.).
Thank you. A comment is already good enough :D
Or just update to the new version...
I agree with the things that have been said in the comments. There is also one more very important aspect in using static and that is the garbage collector and the memory. If you declare some big data structure static you have to take care of cleaning it yourself by setting it to null, since a static entry in a loaded class will define a garbage collection root and prevent the data from.beeing collected. Also, if you think about multiple instances of your code in one VM it can be a huge pain having the access modelled as static. This e.g. maybe the case once you decide to run your logic in an application server.
On a more technical layer the CPU also does something like branch prediciton. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch\_predictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor) Because the jump can not really be predicted it can not get optimized on different layers (JVM, CPU). That's why the code that does not use the literal is so much slower. &amp;#x200B;
**Branch predictor** In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if–then–else structure) will go before this is known definitively. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined microprocessor architectures such as x86. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/java/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt; Oracle is not contributing updates to OpenJDK repos of versions that it no longer provides public updates to Is this realy correct ? This is really the point over which there is a lot of FUD and confusion. Is it event possible with the OpenJDK licence?
Hmm, the challenge in answering your question is that there are many ways, frameworks, etc... MSA is a style, like SOA. Devil's in the details. I would ask your new team for docs, and be honest about your experience. 
Thanks for your reply. I think my wording was a little wrong. I have to lead the microservice development :p So it is expected from me to learn about the frameworks. What are some popular framework (java)? 
Learning about the principles and architecture design is not just done by using a framework. However deciding on a framework to use, there are books available that teach the principles in conjunction with it. As for most enterprise level projects you will find Spring as one of the goto choices in the industry. Especially the Spring Cloud projects offer a lot of functionality regarding microservice management and tools. https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud As for prototyping or even more beginner friendly technologies you could take a look at JHipster https://www.jhipster.tech/ as it is able to auto generate a lot of stuff for you. However personally I'm not a big fan of this auto generated stuff as many things are hidden under the framework. If you need some kind of messaging technology you can take a look at Kafka or RabbitMQ. Best Regards
The situation is no different to how it has been in the past for JDK 6 and 7. Oracle continued to offer commercial support for these versions after public updates ceased. These commercial Oracle JDK binaries had the same updates as JDK 8, but the code was not contributed to the OpenJDK repos. These Oracle JDK versions were, therefore, a fork of the OpenJDK source. Currently, Red Hat ad Azul (who I work for) backport and contribute updates to JDK 7 and JDK 6. I'm not sure what you mean when you refer to the OpenJDK license. If Oracle chooses not to contribute code to a specific OpenJDK repo there is no issue with the license.
I don't mean to be a hater, but I never liked these puzzles. I simply cannot see their purpose: such code is very very bad and should never be written in the first place: so where's the point in knowing how such code works?
Obviously you should not write code like that. However people sometimes do it by accident and are surprised by results. So by learning about these cases, you gain extra knowledge what to avoid and why. And the book is fun to read. 
That is true for some of the puzzles but if you work on different code bases you are going to see a lot. I thought they where fun and the puzzles always helped me to have a very close look on code. It trained me to not overlook details and carefully examine everything that is written. It is outdated though, lots of stuff would be detected by IDE or code analysis plugins, that's why I was asking whether anyone knew a more up to date alternative.
I don't really understand what the issue is here. If you don't like Oracle's business practices, don't use Oracle products. Migrate to something different. I have an extreme dislike for Oracle so I don't use their products. NBD. If, for some unfortunate reason, your company is married the the idea of "Oracle support", then that sucks. Try to talk them out of using their products, pointing out comparable, competitively priced, alternatives. If they don't bite, then keep it to yourself and move on. Oracle is in the business of making money and there are plenty of alternative JDKs that people like Azul and IBM will be more than happy to take your money to support. I'd rather throw my effort into yelling about the Google/Oracle Java API bs, because being able to copy-write open apis is where the real evil lies. 
Thanks for your detailed reply. I will look into the options you mentioned. Additionally, Can you specify the name of some recommended books? I am a bit of an ole fashion guy in that regards, like to read books
Thanks a lot for the response! What I had in mind in terms of licence is that the GPL licence would force them to contribute back any change done to the forked codebase, but to be frank, (as you may have guessed), I only have a very vague idea of what I'm talking about.... When you say that Oracle Jdk 6 &amp; 7 binaries had the same updates as JDK 8, I guess you mean that *some* changes (probably related to security) could have been backported privately to an internally forked JDK7 codebase. So in theory, any other contributor to openJDK could have performed such a backport themselves if they wanted, correct? Still in theory, in case there had been a security issue which would have been present in JDK7 but not in JDK 8 (for some reason), there could have been a fix done on the JDK7 codebase only which would not be present in any "public" openJDK repository. In this case, Oracle JDK could contain some security fix which could not be in the corresponding openJDK (unless, if the security issue is public, some other openJDK contributor reimplement a fix (maybe differently from scratch). Is this explanation correct (and does it even make sense?)
Back in my day, everything was static. But that was back when everything was in ASM and we only had about 16 kilobytes of memory. Today I use statics a lot during development, like a testing sandbox. But the final product has almost no static objects save constants which will never change anyway. Often working from the "this works well as a static, but how can I make it work better as a member" mentality will help you get a better structure for your project. I look for where the static is referenced most to determine the best approach for streamlining the source. &amp;#x200B;
Question 10's answer seems to be unrelated to it's question. Will it compile? Yes. Will it run? No.
I learned a lot from the book "Spring Microservices in Action" from John Carnell. Deals with the Topic of using Spring Boot + Cloud for building Microservice applications.
No, I'm being completely honest here when I say that Minecraft is poorly written. Great game, just messy sourcecode. It's recommended you learn Java before even trying to mod Minecraft, so you can see why it's messy. Though the latest version is cleaning up a lot of the problems, and it shows, it would still be very difficult for a new developer to wade through all that mess. I have developed a few mods for Minecraft, and the modding APIs that other people write tend to be a mess as well, usually because they have to cope with Mojang's bad habits.
When I was a newbie I understood why interviewers asked me to solve puzzles in code challenges. But when I interview as a senior engineer, I think it is a bit lazy to ask me to run the fibinocci sequence.
Had answer for 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9! &gt;7. Does Android have a main method? You should use \`Does Android apps have a main method?\` Also you can add Rust to the list of languages that use the main method. I'd remove Python as the main language is purely a developer choice and don't have any meaning for Python: some developers use it because they are used to have a main method, but most developers don't. And you should not confuse the "if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':" line with a main method: it only depends on which file was run by the user. It's the same in Ruby.
Rather than what most developers do, what’s the most readable / maintainable entry point practice for Python? (Honest question, since I find most Python longer than a single file to be quite opaque.)
What I usually to is create a Main class or Main method in my file, and keep the [main.py](https://main.py) file short, only as an entry point. I think it's the most clear and efficient way to do thing, but as far as I know, there is no general recommendation for this. Also, Python is not more confusing than other languages if code is properly structured (usage of classes, one class per file, proper naming convention, packages, ...). In summary, Python is not less readable than other language if dev don't do shit with it. And other languages are as unreadable as Python when writing shitty code. From my experience, there is really no difference between languages for that.
Spring, Vert.x, Dropwizard, SparkJava,.... There are a lot. It really depends on the type of application and your requirements. That said, I love Vert.x. 
One recommendation I give anyone creating a REST API: Contract first! Use the OpenAPI specification to design the API first and then use tools like OpenAPI Generator to stub the code for clients and servers. You'll Thank me later when everyone's code "just works" together. 
Some of these hacks are really useful when writing that single method that is called 20_000 per second and need to perform 2000x faster than the other version of code would perform. It also exposes you to how JVM works, shows edge-cases of JLS, I found it really helpful. Solving and writing puzzles forced me to look into java bytecode, reading JLS and learning about architecture of JVM, bytecode, compiler and more.
This might be a SUPER dumb question... WHEN is a good time to use an interface? Does anyone have any real world examples on when it's beneficial to use one? I'm still pretty new to Java (8 weeks in, the class I'm taking mostly focuses on SpringBoot). 
It is a BD for an enterprise company to migrate away from Oracle. You'll find that a bunch of their software apps rely on Oracle stored procedures, and Oracle middleware. To change that will be man-years of effort which, in the end, delivers no new functionality, just the same functionality on different software and hardware. It's like saying that, since protection rackets are neighborhood-based, why not just move your store to a different neighborhood? Compound that with Oracle's (very clever) drug-dealer approach to allowing you download and run their software "for free" and then auditing you later when you've built some software or process that depends on their products. Nothing they're doing is wrong, necessarily, that is, it's all legal, but, it's somewhat predatory. Even as a very small software company, I have fielded a number of calls from Oracle saying, "hey, just wanted to introduce myself, I noticed your company downloaded MySQL and we wanted to know if you have any questions about it. As long as we're on the topic, tell me about how you package our JDBC JARs with your product."
Think of an interface like a contract. All concrete classes that implement an interface have a contractual obligation to implement the non-`default` methods in that interface. This becomes really useful when dealing with types. For instance, `Thread`'s constructor accepts an instance of type `Runnable`. There is a guarantee that any object passed to that constructor has a `run()` method, which the thread can then invoke. The JavaDoc for `Runnable` can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html), and the JavaDoc for `Thread` can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html).
I completely agree that the migration is non-trivial. The project I work on that pays the bills is completely married to an monolithic Oracle database. It sucks, but complaining about it doesn't really do much. I'm pushing to get everything new we do to use something different (mongo, postgres, a freaking in memory concurrent map). 
You're right, complaining about it doesn't do any good. I think the challenge here is that it's deliberately very easy for people that don't pay the bills to sew Oracle into the stack. Your architect will design something using Oracle JDK, Oracle middleware, whatever. The team builds it and downloads a bunch of DB vms or whatever for testing. They use JMC for profiling, whatever, and everybody is downloading the tools they need from Oracle willy-nilly. The contract people have no visibility into what's being designed and how and the designers have no visibility into what it all costs until it's too late. One can say, "well, they should!", but it's not as easy as that. Sharing information across large groups and between groups is one of the biggest human challenges we face. It gets a little easier, perhaps, if we're all aware of the risk of using Oracle products, on both sides of the fence.
\#8 is wrong or badly described. A single Java file can only have 1 public class.
Agreed. It's perfectly legal Java. Some of these questions are badly written.
Interfaces are for portable functionality or addons imo
Start reading, there's lots to learn. API styles, CQRS vs. CRUD, understanding what is a microservice, etc... Something to note is that with microservices you've got a lot more points of failure, so you need to design failure tolerance into your system and operational processes.
Also a dumb question, but what's up with first photos on medium? does the author choose them, or are they just random images? I'm not sure if I saw them on every article, but whenever I do, it seems very irrelevant (and sometimes borderline inappropriate) -- if not eerie.

I will focus on one of these atm, to get an idea of how all of this works. Thanks a lot for your inputs. Do you have any recommendations on which one to pickup that is a little beginner friendly?

Most business logic should be behind an interface. Same with classes that interact with the database. Interfaces are also good for declaring what you want from a class before actually implementing. If you want to stay at high level before writing another class you can create the interface and finish the high level code your working on.
&gt;business logic What do you mean by business logic?
Having worked with JSch I had a pretty awful experience. If I remember correctly, had some issues with its `known_hosts` handling. The complete lack of documentation and no source code versioning made its source code very difficult to understand. It wasn't helped by the meaningless single character variable names and things like `foo2`. The lack of even the most basic software development practices makes a security library very difficult to trust and audit.
Business logic is sort of like the core algorithms of your system.
Again, it depends on what you want to accomplish. If you need high concurrency+low latency then Vert.x is ideal. If not, then any should suffice. Look at the project, determine the constraints, and choose the tools which fit. Java is nice, but it's not the only/best answer for everything. Additionally, if you use Java, then other tools will help you reduce complexity: jOOQ, Lombok, RxJava, etc...

I just discovered an old copy of this book the other day, went on Amazon and found that there is a 2015 edition.

This was totally my choice, i wanted to use stock photos that showed similarity and difference within the same image just the way the interfaces can be similar but have intrinsic differences. So the same guy with different reactions was my go to. Totally unrelated to the post though. 
Very nice work! I've always wanted to create some kind of audio visualizer for music. I've been teaching myself opengl/directx lately to try to use audio frequencies as fragment shader input values to generate visuals. 
Business logic is the actual process of what your program does. Take order fulfilment for an online store as an example. The (simplified) interface could be: ```java public interface FulfilmentService { void dispatchOrder(Order order); } ``` Now within the _implementation_ of that method there'll be a whole bunch of stuff: getting a warehouse picker to pack the item, printing the delivery label, booking the space on the truck. But the part of the application that takes the user's order doesn't need (or want) to know about any of that. It just knows that if it sends an Order object to a class that implements this interface, the order will be dispatched to the customer.

I would very much like to be able to visualize a flounder. 
There is a way to us a console..like in Ruby or node, but in java, the big 3 IDE's all support interactive graphical IDE debugging. Just invoke your app in debug mode in intellij community, or eclipse, or netbeans, and you can set a break point in the ide and it will pick it up when it is hit and allow you to click around and change variables in memory on the fly. 
I'm not sure I understand. Typically you could use an IDE to keep an active console. You mention using windows explorer, is there a reason you cannot use PowerShell or a command window to launch the application? You could even redirect outputs via 1&gt; file.txt or 2&gt; err.txt Alternatively, you could use a logging framework to output a textfile containing whatever you need.
the app is actually called by another app. I can launch it in console and see output but when it is called by the other app behind the scenes so to speak there is no way for me to debug. i can't attache to the instance that is spawned. But, I think that your logging solution is the way to go. Thanks
Thanks for the reply. I am using InteliJ and can debug from there. My problem is that the compiled app (executable JAR) is getting spawned from another application as a plugin. I was just tinkering with Java Mission control but it does not seem to pick up the instance when the app spawns it.
Yep, using an IDE and running the program through the IDE in debug mode is the most convenient answer. Another option is to enable a _remote debugger_. This is possible with Maven, for example, and allows you to attach a debugger to some remote thing that you connect to from your side (this is also something you’d probably do from an IDE run configuration). Google for “maven surefire remote debugger” and there’s results (sorry I’m on mobile). 
Can you change the way the other application came yours? If it is a simple process, you can add some parameters to wait for a debugger. 
Have a google around for Java JAR debug at runtime. Assuming your originator application invokes your target debug application with something like java -jar on the command line, you can add parameters to this startup command something along the lines of -Xdebug... and then in an IDE like Eclipse it IntelliJ you can set up a debug configuration that you run and will pick up any debug points you hit. [This looks promising. ](https://www.eclipsezone.com//eclipse/forums/t53459.html) 
Well, the primary reason you don't ship Java with the application is the same reason you don't ship JDBC drivers or RDBMSs: if you provide it to your (corporate) customers, you are liable for it, and it's tough enough to support customers on the software you wrote yourself, but impossible to support software from someone else.
I have this book signed by Gafter and Bloch. 
I generally do not create an interface unless I need to provide multiple implementations.
I can not change it. &amp;#x200B;
Set your break points like you normally would in IntelliJ, build your JAR, and use this to attach to the running process https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html
cool.. Ill give it a shot!

export to jar (shadow/fat for gradle/maven), then throw it into launch4j and generate an exe file. if that's what you want to do.
You can attach to a running app if you you control the app that launches it or can pass in the debug arguments like -Xdebug etc - look up Java remote debugging
With jdk9 and above you can create a custom jre image using jlink and execute the app with an .exe
Great project! What do you think is the biggest source of latency and have you thought about how to minimize it? At the beat tempo in your UI demo video, the lights peak at about a 16th-8th note after the sound.

Hey! My bad for not clarifying that in the article. They should be separate files in the same project.
The audio capture process is the biggest source of latency. The java api for capturing sound is not that great. It has 2 main problems: * audio latency of at least 30 ms * the latency varies anywhere from 30 to 60 ms if you use a low buffer it does a really strange thing where reading the first buffer takes 30 ms and the next 1 to n buffers takes 0 ms. It is really non-deterministic and i have no idea how to make it consistent. &amp;#x200B; The solution: Use a different framework that uses java native library to call C code in order to get the audio input. I have tested this library: [https://sjoerdvankreel.github.io/xt-audio/](https://sjoerdvankreel.github.io/xt-audio/) It works really well. It uses RTaudio ([https://www.music.mcgill.ca/\~gary/rtaudio/](https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/)) for real time low latency audio capture. In my tests i can grab the audio input with a latency of 10 ms and with a few tweeks even 3 ms. The integration of this library will take some time and a lot of work but it is planned for the future. &amp;#x200B; There is a trade off to be think about because you need enough data to do a fast fourier transform and get a reliable output, but the more data that you read before processing the more latency you introduce. &amp;#x200B; Another thing that is not shown in the demo is that i use "Virtual Cable" in order to route the audio output to an audio input device (java can only read the audio from an audio input device). This also adds latency because of how Virtual Cable works but this time this is in my favor because the delay is added after i do the processing. 
Thank you and keep me posted with what you do. That sound very interesting.

Lol! I see I have been crucified for this. I have learnt my lesson.
Have you tried remote debugging the app? You run your app with some debug args (check intellij remote debug and it will tell you the exact args needed) then the JVM will start with an open port for a debugger to attach. Then you can run intellij remote debugger and attach it to your running program. Happy debugging.
It always amazes me how people write articles without even bothering to respect basic naming conventions. Was it that hard to name the child nodes left and right?! /rant
Kinda out of topic, but since you execute the plug-in from command line, [this library](https://github.com/mhashim6/System-Command-Executor) might be helpful.
Have in mind you have to add some flags to the span java process to be able to debug it remotely. How you are able to do that, it will depend how you span that java process. -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005

Will Amazon feed back security patches into OpenJDK 8?
Any idea when they will launch a version for java 11?
Cool. Happy to be rid of Oracle's JDK. Is there any reason to use Coretto over the OpenJDK builds that are already in Ubuntu repositories?
The article says April 2019.
Written in the article. April 2019 for testing.
What happens after that? I feel like this could easily be similar to classic Oracle tactics. Give cheap or free use of the product and once people have become dependent on it, start charging exorbitant prices.
It all comes down to how long you want to stay on a release. If you are comfortable updating every 6 months or so then OpenJDK is fine. Beyond that it gets a bit complicated with regards to LTS releases (such as Java 11 and eventually Java 17)
That's the whole idea, isn't it? Corretto is just an OpenJDK distro as I see it.
So now the only thing missing is a Web Start replacement like IcedTea-Web. I guess everyone is a bit reluctant due to the security implications...

What a list. Brilliant. Though I write a lot of concurrent code and knew 95% of the list, it's absolutely not a bad thing to get reminded once in a while. I enjoyed reading this, thank you. In 12.3. (Timeout variables, parameters) you recommend either having the unit in the name of the member (`timeoutSeconds`) or having the unit on an API. You do not mention using a `Duration`, though. Does that have any specific reason, or did you just go for the JDK-style length+unit advice because of so much old code existing already?
Dont use a jdk THAT old.
Waiting for 9, 10, and 11
9 and 10 won't be released. If I understand right they will only release LTS versions. So 8, 11, 17, 23 etc... 
Oh! There's one thing I miss - thinking about spurious wakeups. Is that intentionally omitted, too (perhaps because the list does not go deep into the low-level specifics and tries to recommend avoiding them instead)? A point telling something in the line of _"If the code uses `wait()`+`notify()`, are the methods called while holding this object's intrinsic lock? Are the `wait()` methods properly shielded against spurious wakeups by being called in a conditioned loop? Same advice applies for `Condition`'s `await()`+`signal()` calls except those methods need to hold the parent `Lock` instance."_ would be nice. Perhaps even suggesting Guava's [`Monitor`](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/Monitor.html) class.
I found out recently that the version of java in 18.04 LTS isn't really 11, it's 10. If Corretto is more reliable than than OpenJDK and Canonical then I might switch to it long term.

Not necessarily. Amazon might just backport security patches from newer releases into Correto, not into OpenJDK 8 itself. If that is the case only the Correto distribution would contain these and no other OpenJDK 8 builds e.g. from AdoptOpenJDK.
It's "under discussion": https://github.com/corretto/corretto-8/issues/5
Comprehensive, though I have never before seen "TUS" used as a shortened version of "Tuesday" .
I'm not sure why this isn't mentioned, but if you are switching over an enum and have covered all of the constants, an explicit `default` case is *not* required.
Pretty much any language will be less verbose. I haven't tried Kotlin but what about Kotlin does not convince you?
So we had been locked in to webstart for more than a decade and it took me about a week to package a new signed exe with a modularized jdk that downloaded and parsed the jnlp to launch our application. I was also able to create zip/sh packages for mac/Linux using jlink. There is less downloading, better mac/Linux support and no java cache issues for our support team to deal with. Since I could sign the exe we actually have less issues with permissions and AV software now too. 
It absolutely should. If the JDKs become largely incompatible we're all screwed. 
Why would anyone choose to use Amazon over adoptopenjdk or zulu? (Serious question)
Kotlin does not dratically reduce code writing. It suggests covention that are understood by the language. For example, data classes use a convention. If your use do mot comply to the convention, then you are pretty much writing the same amount of code as i java (minus the semi colons of coures). Sam3 gows for the shortcuts like lazy, etc... Additionnally, to be in line with the convention means potentially migrating old code to either the java implemention of the convention or to kotlin. ....
Non verbose language doesn't mean automatically higher productivity. Programmers spent a lot of time with reading a code. The more productive language is the better understandable . It can be also less verbose, but not necessary. I saw a very "clever" formula with pointers written in C, but it tooks me a lot of time to understand it. It would be better to write the formula to three lines of code than let it in the non verbose format.
I draw the same conclusion while testing kotlin. The fact that a lot of logic is implied tends to lead to me having to spend more time to understand what is going on. I assume that this will not be the case with an expert kotlin developer but still. 
This doesn't help right now, but Java is getting less verbose over time. Records will resolve one of the current biggest pain points. Namely the verbosity around data classes.
Looks like a Kotlin `when` statement.
Manning are one of the better publishers for Java. They've replaced O'Reilly as my preferred publisher when it comes to Java books.

I articulated my idea pretty poorly. I'm more concerned that this is reflective of a larger plan to draw in users and create reliance on Amazon's infrastructure. Amazon certainly has their own motives at heart, and they wouldn't make this kind of commitment if there wasn't something in it for them.
Typescript might be worth a look. Apart from property!constructor definitions etc the different type system can make expressing some stuff more natural and concise.
Corretto patches are upstreamed to OpenJDK. Only if a patch is rejected corretto might still include it.
Before April technically means March
Defect rate per 1000 lines of code is mostly the same across languages. I don't like it either but we really should be erring on the side of languages like Forth or APL rather than languages like Java.
Thing is, Amazon rakes in the money via AWS, and they have a vested interest in having Java supported there as hassle-free as possible. Having a concrete period allows enterprises to plan better.
Knowing you have a large company providing support is really a big deal in a business context, but not really a big deal for personal work.
They use Java. Their customers use Java and Oracle has a competitor to AWS.

Key question is how long it takes to find and fix the bugs. As I wrote, one line code can be harder to understand than the three lines. So, the bugfixing effort can be less in more verbose language. However, not necessary ...

TL;DR
&gt; So, the bugfixing effort can be less in more verbose language. I take it you have never had to trawl across pages and pages of diarrhea to debug a fucking typo right?
Typescript feels very much like writing Java on the front end compared to JavaScript. It made me not hate doing front end development.
This would have been a lot clearer if it didn't use JShell (and wouldn't have needed a segue into what JShell is).
I see what you mean, and it's definitely possible for them to do this, but pulling such a stunt when so many of their clients rely deeply on Java could be very damaging to their business. I think they instead want to provide this as a service to their customers in order to have more control over the whole system, and to encourage Java developers to use AWS. Just my two cents :)
Here you go: int numLetters = switch (day) { case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -&gt; 6; case TUESDAY -&gt; 7; case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -&gt; 8; case WEDNESDAY -&gt; 9; };
another pattern match implementation. switch can be expression sounds very nice\~
Amazon uses this release itself. It is more promising

Alternatively, by encouraging the prolonged stability of java, they keep developer mindshare in the java ecosystem. Which also happens to be the ecosystem that the bulk of their services are built in. By prolonging the popularity of java, they keep their own products relevant and their hiring pool healthier. 
Umm, I am quite sure most people ship a runtime with their app. It would be bizarre not to.
Get zip file from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
Is this not JDK?
Just download JRE, put to the folder and specify path to it in the program. Usually software which requires Jre allow to specify path to it explicitly in the settings. And this question is for r/javahelp, not general Java sub. 
They also offer the JRE only archive. Look für other platform.
I dont understand.
I wish they wouldn't call them "records". Why not "data" like Kotlin?
Excuse me, I download the JRE only version, however after going to the bin file and launching java.exe nothing happens, cmd opens up for a split second then closes.
What do you expect to happen ? You need to run a jar file or some java classes with it. 
No, not currently pattern matching, but a step on the way to that functionality.
Yes,hope to be better :)
During Brian Goetz pressentation I've missed the point that new switch expressions can be a poly expressions. How nicely it interacts with var. Very cool indeed!
If you're not restricting yourself to JVM languages, look at Perl and APL. Personally I don't use either of them, but they certainly show what's possible in terms of making things concise. For instance, here's an APL snippet that finds all prime numbers from 1 to R, courtesy of Wikipedia: &gt; `(~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓ιR`
Thanks for the feedback. There are so many esoteric symbols in there for the average developper though. I will have a look out of curiosity. 
&gt; poly expressions. How nicely it interacts with var Could you expand on that?
I already did. However, typo is an easy bug to find and fix. Many typos are fixed directly by IDE (keywords, methods, classes or variables names). And the rest is the same for verbose and non verbose language. The harder bugs are those where the complicated logic is involved. Let's compare these two lines with the same result: APL: X[⍋X+.≠' ';] Java: Collections.sort( x, ( x1, x2 ) -&gt; x1.length() - x2.length() ); The first one is non verbose and there are less letters in the line. However, I would prefer the second one. The programmer don't need to know Java language, but from the line he can understand, there is some sorting and it has something to do with length (so it is probably string). From the APL language you can't understand nothing - you have to learn language at first.
If you cant specify path in software try to specify it in system environment. If you haven't admin privileges so you can't set environment for OS then you still can specify it to your local user
Thanks for this. Going to start reading 
Its in the article. But mainly you can write: `var today = switch(day) {` `case SAT, SUN -&gt; "Weekend day";` `case MON, TUS, WED, THU, FRI -&gt; "Working day";` `default -&gt; {` `var len =` [`day.name`](https://day.name)`().length();` `break len;` `}` `};` If you pass Day.SUN to this expression, today = "Weekend day" and its of type **String**. If you pass Day.NONE to this expression, today = 4 (it goes to default arm) and its of type **int**. If today was of type String or of type int, code would not compile, but because its a **var**, it can evaluate to both String and int, depending on which switch arm it lands.
Type inference is not dynamic typing. It's impossible for a Java variable to change its type at runtime. My best guess is that `today` is of type `Object`.
"Dark" mode, under eclipse/2018-12 : - mainly because for me, the dark mode is less aggressive for the eyes - as a minor point, i find it easier to find eclipse windows while alt-tabbing (as a lot of my other windows (explorer, outlook, ...) are in white mode) I'm still astonished that it has taken so long to have a fully working dark mode under eclipse (i would say that before eclipse/photon there was still quite some glitches).
Kotlin's `when` is much more powerful, though.

The thing is that I would personally prefer the second one too but the evidence of defect rate being proportional to lines of code strongly suggests we should use minimalist languages even if we don't like them. It's not about intuitive preference but about the statistics on defect rates. As for programmers not needing to know the Java language that's simply more to do with which programming language styles are more popular at the moment than anyone being more natural. It's the kind of thing I'd expect to hear from a pointy haired boss wanting to outsource labour cheaply.
C# is great!

How to kill a declining language 101.
[Declining language?](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
Downvoting you won't make career prospects better, but it will help other people viewing the comments know you're making a claim that is contrary to any available evidence
Oracle knows it's hard to rewrite all that legacy Java code, which there is tons of out there. So they're just going to keep on milking it. What's going to happen is that any new enterprise software is going to be written in another language.
Hmm use OpenJdk?
Integration mainly using apache camel. We have just shifted off Weblogic and are moving into Jboss Fuse on Karaf.
I don't personally, but I know [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org) uses osgi and karaf for their desktop app.
The second highest in that chart in C. Are you kidding me that you're taking that as a serious statistic?
Java and C are still very, very popular. Not sure where you're getting your statistics from...
C and Java are inflated in that chart because of: 1) Legacy Projects 2) Computer Science Courses The Tiobe index itself even mentions a data point is: &gt; The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, **courses** and third party vendors. Given that these two are staples in every 20-40 year old CS curriculum, they're going to be much higher on the chart than anything else.
Regarding your second edit, I don't get the impression Oracle cares that much about Java. And we're seeing their genius plan to monetize it - support contracts. Not enough to justify a campaign to suppress descent.
I've had people with their data on their reddit accounts that link back to twitter pages for people at Oracle HQ downvote and angrily respond to negative posts I've had towards Java here, in the past. This subreddit is very much curated.
Can you provide any proof of that?
Just wait and take a look at the profiles here that respond. They'll show their faces.
Agree with you man. Java programmers are the most boring people in the world. And I say that as a java programmer who just quit his high paying job because he couldn’t stand his idiot colleagues who cannot turn on a light if the switch has no java sdk.
Well given the premise of your post, it's hard to argue it's declining except on mathematical level since it's so popular. And the general idea that this model is bad is sort of irrelevant. Sure it's causing some initial confusion, but it's been discussed many, many times that people should be using openjdk. No big deal.
Good thing RedHat is supporting it on Linux and Windows! I'd assume they'll support it on Apple, too. 
I suggest [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework#learn) :)
I bet you're a JavaScript developer. 
From the real world? Where projects in java and c don't happen and make no sense?
It's c u r r e n t y e a r how is oracle still snaring people into paying them anything?
Yeah, all of those C courses they teach in 2019.
I knew Oracle was scummy, but I didn't know they were *this* scummy.
Is OpenJDK available for Windows? It only shows for Linux. 
OSGi's primary purposes are classpath hell resolution and hot module loading. These problems don't really exist in containerized architectures, which is how most microservices are deployed today. I cannot understand why you'd use OSGi in 2019. It's a lot of cognitive overhead for problems that have been solved already, and in better ways.
Yes. OpenJDK builds of Java 11, for instance, are available [here](https://jdk.java.net/11/). Other versions are available on [jdk.java.net](jdk.java.net).
I recently graduated and had multiple courses in C, C++ and assembly. They're still taught and widely used. 
And the builds on jdk.java.net are Oracle's.
Thanks for clarifying!
Like what?
did for about a year at a job. almost every day from my start date until I left I asked why we were using Karaf. I got the same one or two sentence response every time, touting it's theoretical superiority for hot swapping at runtime and classpath resolution. yet the development teams would spend (read: waste) hours sometimes whole portions of a day wrestling with these issues. and in reality our deployments weren't even leveraging the dynamic hot swapping - we were stopping the container wholesale and restarting it with the new services. a few of my coworkers and I pointed all this out and we were consistently handed a sunk cost fallacy response of "we already invested all the time and money to get established on this infrastructure, so we can't switch off of it now". there are cases where OSGi is advantageous and strategically a good decision. but with the deployment and runtime tools we have today, and for most of the business applications I have encountered, it's just not worth all the effort.
Go to adoptopenjdk.net
Yeah, it’s 2019 and IoT is absolutely not a thing... /s
Hey now, not all of us are like that homie
Java on OpenJDK, looking at the other comments here. ^(Failed I have, into exile I must go.)
Adaptopenjdk is available on osx as well. 
[Three days since this was last posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/alwmhk/oracles_newest_audit_tactic_focusing_on_java/), so I suppose I'll just copy-paste my comment from there: &gt; So customers are left with two choices: either get a license from Oracle and pay for support, or run a version of Java for free that’s unsupported. Or (as articles of this kind often fail to point out), **run a version of Java with paid support from someone else (Azul, IBM, Red Hat, etc.)**. Seriously, we all know that Oracle love milking their business customers. That's not news. And we all know that the licensing terms have changed because there's been an "OMG I have to pay for Java now!?!?!?" post here every couple of days since September. But I'm getting tired of this kind of dishonest scaremongering that tries to pretend that selling your company's soul to Oracle and OMG NO SUPPORT AT ALL are literally the only options. 
“I can’t possibly be wrong, therefore all these downvotes must be from Oracle shills”
While it's nonsense that Java is declining; Tiobe is trash that should never ever be linked on programming subs. Text index hits are in no way an indication on the popularity of a language.
I did a project once using Karaf and OSGi, it was a nightmare. Instead of delivering business functionality, we wrestled against OSGi and stuff. Refactored that whole project later to Spring Boot. To be fair, we didn't use any advantages of OSGi (code reloading, plugins, etc), so we only experienced the downsides.
We are using Karaf/OSGi on some older projects. IMO Karaf/OSGi mainly addresses problems like: \- classpath hell resolution \- dynamic application modularity (features mat be installer and unistalled while application is running) This sounds really great, but this is what i have observed over years working with Karaf/OSGi: \- classpath hell is not a problem (rarely is a problem) when working with microservices \- if you have classpath problem, your peoject is messed up and you should revisit the design \- development for Karaf/OSGi is very expensive, way more difficult than 'normal' java development \- it's not exactly easy to develop application with dynamic modularity. most developers don't get it right which results to overly complex and unmaintainable code \- in many cases, 3-rd party jars are not OSGi compatible and you end up in fixing other projects or wrapping them As a result of above, we are moving away from Karaf/OSGi where possible and will never go back because: \- in microservice world, you need to solve completely different problems like load balancing, clustering, service registration, ... none of these are solved by karaf \- in microservice world, propabality of classpath conflict is really low, if you are careful, you will be fine \- there are better frameworks, check [vertx.io](https://vertx.io) \- projects migrated form Karaf are suddenly cleaner, simpler and more maintainable (cheaper to run) \- unless your customer / project has very good reason (and budget) to justify Karaf/OSGi, don't go there. &amp;#x200B;
But not Oracle JDK, and not under the Oracle JDK licensing restrictions. They do however not offer LTS builds (i.e. &gt;6mo support for major versions).
FUD about java updates. There's a good reason why so many people are confused about the support changes - Oracle hasn't exactly been talkative about them.
You'd be surprised. Especially in OS dev they still swear by it.
Comment above said "OpenJDK builds are available..." And then I provided the missing part that those builds are made by Oracle itself. Of course OpenJDK builds are not the same as Oracle JDK. 
Genuinely surprised that a net-new Fuse project is kicking off on Karaf. Almost all the clients I’ve worked with on Fuse over the last 18 months have gone to SpringBoot as the runtime. Any particular reason for that design decision?
what does it matter if the builds are made by oracle when the license is gplv2+cpe?
It was just a clarification.
If you study computer science where I live (in Germany), you will learn lots of Java, enough of C and a little bit C++. No other languages except SQL in databases and matlab if you choose so. 
Nah I think that perception is a little out of date. In my experience the primary uses of OSGi are the service model and generic requirement/capability resolution, which still can be applied to resolve distributed runtimes (and has most certainly not been solved anywhere else in "better ways"). I think there are vaguely sketched out plans to separate these features out from the framework so that they can be applied to non-OSGi runtimes, which would help a lot.
I mean.. I understand to some degree how some companies might be inclined to pay for a superior product, support, etc. But I gotta tell you in all my years (and there are a few of them in there) that I have worked anywhere that paid IBM, Oracle, Cisco, etc money to license software or hardware.. it has ALWAYS been a massive pain in the ass, but more so, the 10s of 1000s to millions even spent on licenses... why? I dont understand it. A recent job I was part of funded by an entity that originally put a couple mil towards a few teams of eng/qa/etc to build a custom product, that was basically working, decided to can it all and go to Oracle to pay 10s of millions for "off the shelf" software and try to make that work. It baffles me. The fact that it will cost literally 30x as much to use their product, but more so they have to figure out how to shoe horn their one size fits all (read that is shit software) into a very small custom use case, which ends up meaning dozens of Oracle arcs/engs are now going to spend a couple years and millions more in charges to implement all this. Meanwhile, we already had something working, very custom, very specific, using open source software and custom built software on top of it. I just dont get it. Is it that the execs/decision makers at some of these companies are good friends or owe someone a favor so they decide to screw over and see a bunch of people laid off, throw away a few mil in already built and ready to run software, just to redo it all with old archaic super expensive software? This always reminds me of the cluster fuck otherwise known as the Maglev train of California vs Elon Musk Hyperloop. As the story goes the Maglev will cost something like 30 billion and take 15 or more years to build, meanwhile Elon can do the same thing with hyperloop in a few years at a fraction of the cost. But the state wants to waste huge money on what was a great idea 20 years ago but is now showing its age and a better technology at a lot less money has come along. Meanwhile, half the world goes hungry and is in poverty while a few assholes in positions they have no right being in toss enough money around to feed the world twice over. We are a failed species. 
Funny thing: I made an **aggregate of 7 of the most popular "programming language indexes" ([TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [PYPL](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), [Redmonk](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/08/10/language-rankings-6-18/), [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages), [HackerRank](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018#developer-tools2), [GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages), [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology))**. I picked the top 10 languages from each ranking (excluding HTML / CSS and languages that didn't appear in at least 2 of the 7 rankings) and gave 10 points to the first, 9 to the second etc. Non-languages like HTML / CSS and languages appearing only in one of the rankings are also excluded as anomalies. **Java still comes out on top**. Don't have the data right now but I linked each ranking so you can make it yourself.
https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#native-images . By the way, windows support is coming soon.
From this article, it sounds like Oracle is deliberately exploiting these communication inefficiencies to make a profit. If that's the case it's certainly worthwhile spreading awareness of it. 
Honestly, I have no idea what has happened but I don't think Java had anything to do with it :)
Sorry, but this is not a Java related question. This is a question for **/r/techsupport**.
I'm going to assume you're talking about Windows. &gt; I assumed that it was an app like google chrome, and this way I could quickly click on it Chrome is almost certainly not actually installed to your desktop, it just puts a *shortcut* there. The actual application files should live somewhere like `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome` and are huge. Java should also be installed somewhere under Program Files for most users. So I think you're saying that you've set the actual *install location* to the desktop? Programs generally assume that they "own" the directory they are installed to, and they must be installed to separate locations. If you try to install something to a directory which already has contents the installer will likely warn you of the problem, and if you tell it to go ahead anyway it may well erase the current contents of that directory. Does that sound like what might have happened? Unless the installer was kind enough to move your files to the Recycle Bin rather than just delete them completely then I'm afraid you're probably not going to get them back, but you can always look into *data recovery software*.
I’m stoked for fibers
I guess you're wrong here. First, that sounds like something you'd code in JavaScript, not Java, and secondly, this is more a developer help subreddit, so if you're not a developer I don't really see how we can help.
My apologies, I meant JavaScript..! I'm sat next to my developer so any advice I can get on here will be forwarded straight to him. Just doing a bit of research. :)
perhaps have a layer above your content (css) thats click-through, which plays an animation/gif of the ripples+transparency for everywhere not the ripple (giving the illusion that the ripples are independent and generated) when you click the O (this event could be fired using jquery or the like). that would be my initial approach. either that or generate SVG objects and animate it using JS/etc. 
... The title is about microservices. Sure OSGi is well suited for IoT clients... But that's not what the thread is about.
Come by /r/webdev and /r/javascript with this question, you should have better luck there.
&gt;Wicked thanks for the recommendation !
I've never been thrilled with default interface methods. I feel it goes against the whole purpose of an interface. Now, not to break out the tinfoil, but I think the real reason this feature got added was the Stream API. The Java designers wanted to add all of these new Stream API methods, and wanted to put them in the top level collections interfaces, but also didn't want to break all the implementations out there in the world. So viola, default methods it is. &amp;#x200B; Problem is, now we can have multiple inheritance for the first time, and I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Personally, I've never used a default method in a piece of code I've written to date, but maybe I'm missing out, who knows.
Switch to Postgres and Go. Yall cryin like you’re chained at the ankle to that awful stack.
Completely agree
I went looking for evidence of this. Can you link to where they have a supported build for windows? 
the place i worked had somewhere around 30 different "microservices" that were intended to be individually versioned and developed, and then included in the Karaf runtime to be made available to the core applications (of which there were maybe 15-20). some examples of these were microservices were Gson functionality wrappers (because as you mentioned, 3rd party libs that don't support OSGi get wrapped), custom java exceptions and the handlers for them to convert thrown exceptions in HTTP status responses, etc. because all of these were individually versioned/maintained, it was basically a daily occurrence that we would build and test our code just fine but experience runtime failures due to missing dependencies in the Karaf runtime. having to manage both Maven's `pom.xml` and Karaf's `features.xml` for code dependencies vs runtime dependencies is not ideal, but doable enough. it was the combination of updating these microservices that made it a pain in the ass because the application might be dependent on microservice A version 1.0.2 which would require a runtime dependency of microservice B version 2.1.0. now your Maven pom might reference A as a compile-time dependency and so you get the right version of B as a result of Maven's dependency resolution. your Karaf features file might specify A as a runtime dependency, but if you didn't have the right version of B installed then you would get errors. you might even reference B in your features file, but if it wasn't the right version then you could be ok at compile time and not ok at runtime. basically, because of *how it was implemented* we had to have in-depth knowledge of the dependency tree and mirror it both at compile and runtime. on a small-scale project this wouldn't be that bad, and you could even argue it would be a good thing because the development team would have more granular control over the dependency tree. however, these weren't small-scale projects *at all*. i read a lot of material about this from Karaf and other sources, so i will admit that i believe part of the headache was that "we did it wrong". however, i was not the only one who grew tired of this being the daily development norm and advocated abandoning it in favor of letting our build tool handle dependencies and our build artifact being a cohesive, whole unit that could be deployed and accessed without worry of missing runtime dependencies.
yep - we were in the same pitfall. all the headaches, none of the benefits. the documentation is ***abysmal***, so good luck finding examples of how to do things "right" or with any detailed explanation.
This is such a game-changer it's hard to overstate it. We've all been struggling for at least a decade to overcome thread limitations by using SEDA style programming. Fibers return coherent, serial style programming without penalty. 
Actually on the hyper loop point, Elon is horribly failing that project and is trying his hardest to dodge questions on the feasibility of the project as a whole. Their current progress is pathetic compared with the money spent on the project, the most impressive thing that project has spawned is the PR teams ability to keep up the facade on such a disaster of a project, and ofcourse the tunnelling company spin off 
Such a great library, if you dare to lurk in the murky waters of runtime code manipulation.
Fibers fill my pipeline with joy.
I would use JHipster, there is a lot of dead code depending of what you will do since it's a code generator. But it can give you something to show to your client after few devs.
Production ready from minute 0 with no additional hassle is a tall order. I'm skeptical there's anything out there. For example, how would you apply production-level security to a microservice from minute 0 with no additional hassle? Nobody's authentication/authorization is exactly the same. TLS? Certificates? There's always hassle. The key is to minimize the hassle. &amp;#x200B; That being said, [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) is the best way I've found to stand up a single microservice based on Spring Boot. That won't get you all the other infrastructure that is required for something like an ELK stack, though. But it's what I use every time I stand up a new Java code base. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Really? Hadnt read much lately, just that there were two companies making forward progress on demo tracks. I think part of the issue was the funding behind it, but could be wrong. Just seemed at the time it had a lot of momentum and looked more promising than the maglev train project that is taking way too long.
I'd use SpringBoot. It's not everything out of the box, but it's also not a ton of overhead for things you didn't want. There are online guides for integrating Spring with environments or tools not already options on the Spring Boot website, and they rarely require much code. 
Or you can just use AWS Lambda with API Gateway
Kotlin is definitely a language that leverages the fact that most folks use IDEs to write code these days to cut down on verbosity. Type inference is a great example: it can lead to statements where the type of a variable isn't clear from reading the code, however using the IDEs tools it's extremely simple to find that out. Personally, I feel this is a good medium and the direction the industry as a whole is going in. I would prefer a less verbose, but still statically typed, way of doing things.
True, a good point. Integration is definitely a tough topic in microservices world, and I would like to save as much time as possible by not creating my own microservices framework and spending time instead on business features :) Security is a valid point, and it is solved by Istio to some extent (in particular if talking about TLS and certificates), thus some layer of problems just goes away. Monitoring is also ok, Grafana + Prometheus save the day, so no changes to applications are needed. Auth is done in API Gateway, not sure if doing 0 trust network worth it as everything is in VPN behind API Gateway. Still, logging and testing are a big PITA, but they should not be. For example, the big pain that I had during one non-critical project was due to difficulty in tracking what happens when there are 5 microservices processing a request in chain. I developed a convention that we include id of business object (e.g. booking id) to each log entry, so later it is easy to filter out trace and see what happened with that ray. It is like a thin wrapper on top of SLF4J; useful thing, and something that could be included from the very beginning. [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) is a way to go, I also use it, but I wonder if there is something else worth checking.
Do they allow now to debug application with debugger? Last time I worked with it, I had to write tons of logs to CloudWatch in order to be sure that there are no bugs in production.

Nah, Oracle always was evil, even its color is a tribute to its master. 
They don't provide debugger. But even with other solutions, we don't use debugger to debug in production.
I have moved past ever "installing" Java. I have several different versions of Java, and from various 'vendors'. Each application can be configured to simply point to the folder containing the Java that you want it to use. Worst case: start your program using a script (or ".bat" file on Windows) that pre-sets a couple environment variables and then launches your program. No special privileges needed. &amp;#x200B; Where to download Java without depending on what might be installed on your system: [https://aws.amazon.com/fr/corretto/](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/corretto/) [https://github.com/corretto](https://github.com/corretto) &amp;#x200B; [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) [https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild) &amp;#x200B; [http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/](http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/) &amp;#x200B; [https://jdk.java.net/11/](https://jdk.java.net/11/) &amp;#x200B; [https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine](https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine) &amp;#x200B; [https://bell-sw.com/java.html](https://bell-sw.com/java.html) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Agreed. Java isn't completely owned by Oracle. Sun made sure they snookered that possibility before the sale to oracle. This is a point I try to drive home all the time. As of right now, oracle has actually been a pretty good citizen with java. They've been removing commercial features and have unified the platform. OracleJDK and OpenJDK are close to the same thing (much closer than they have been in the past).
Thanks, clear :) I had to develop Lambda application in NodeJS that listens to Amazon S3 lifecycle events quite some time ago. It was a bit painful, because of "works in dev, fails in prod" syndrome (mostly due to the difference in NodeJS version and minor differences in S3 events structure). Debugger would be of great help to handle this case.
You can debug JavaScript/TypeScript lambdas with the Serverless framework, with a bit of setup. 
You probably have to configure and set up a project just the way you like it, and then use that as a base for some sort of template. It's well worth the time if you deploy a lot of different services. 
I believe its a buffer for our on-prem stuff until we can get up and running open-shift. I love spring boot. It seems like the way to go now.
I think you just hit the nail on the head why microservices isn't always puppies and rainbows. Distributed systems and microservices architectures have tons of benefits but the downside is definitely added complexity. &amp;#x200B; There's some pretty common conventions around correlation IDs used to trace requests through distributed systems. They usually get passed in via HTTP headers (or messaging headers if that's your thing). Not too difficult to implement and can usually be plugged in at the filter level of whatever webservice framework you're using. Check this article out: &amp;#x200B; [https://medium.com/@d.lopez.j/spring-boot-setting-a-unique-id-per-request-dd648efef2b](https://medium.com/@d.lopez.j/spring-boot-setting-a-unique-id-per-request-dd648efef2b) &amp;#x200B;
That sounds neat - OpenShift’s a pretty cool platform. The thing to bear in mind is that Karaf and OSGI in a Linux Container (of the type you’d run on OpenShift) is a largely pointless exercise. After all, the dynamic nature of OSGI goes against the Immutability principles set out in Linux Containers - you make changes in OSGI, restart the Container, and your changes are lost. It’s doable, and it will work on a technical level - you just have to be aware of the pitfalls of that approach. Running your Fuse integrations on Spring Boot (or even on EAP, which is also a supported runtime for Fuse) avoid this because they force to rebuild your Containers when you want to make changes. Good luck with the project, sounds interesting!
[HERE](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-introduces-commercial-support-openjdk-microsoft-windows) you go.
As a start, look at Netbeans, Eclipse and Intellij.
Eclipse
I don't think they do, they support it as part of their RHEL license for their Linux distributions.
IntelliJ is by far the best IDE out there. The only downside is that it's not free to use and they will demand you to cough up money once you get to the more advanced stuff like backend frameworks. But for beginner's stuff it's free and you might be eligible for a student license. If you don't want that you'll have to pick between Netbeans and Eclipse. I'd recommend Netbeans for a beginner since it has less legacy baggage on it, but Eclipse isn't too bad of a choise either and it has a lot of die-hard fans.
I've used Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA for Java development throughout the years (also JBuilder, but I'm sure that stopped development many years ago). &amp;#x200B; Eclipse is free to use. IDEA has a community edition that is free to use. Between Eclipse and IDEA I like personally like IDEA better.
I doubt it. Even Sun &amp; IBM didn't support ( or even offer downloads of ) MUCH older versions of the JRE. The Java world has been very good about deprecating old API, but still making it available. However at some point you have to ask people to upgrade. I worked for a company that would have kept JRE's over five years old if they weren't forced by lack of availability to upgrade.
So let's say in a few years, most major developers are using the newer standalone jdk versions to create in their programs. Does this mean end users will no longer need to install anything Java related (besides the program itself they want to run)?
you can still use suggestive variable, class, function etc. names. Then you will have an idea about things without much of the verbosity that is in java. Also kotlin dsl is really nice if you have multiple place where you would use it. It takes one time to learn but it's much easier to read and reason about.
Not a few years. The Java world is slow to get rid of obsolete stuff.
Thanks for the recommendations! I'll look at eclipse and intellij for right now!
Yeah, I figured as much. I know Microsoft for example still uses Java 8 with Minecraft (both the game and for Minecraft servers), and has no plans to migrate to Java 11 that I know of. Though at least they bundle Java with the game.
Also if youre a college student you can get idea professional edition free!
Android called.. :-)
Yup. Definitely one of the more exciting features upcoming.
Very true in enterprise world. The statement from Amazon sold OpenJDK in our organization. Corretto is a **no-cost** distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (**OpenJDK**) with **long-term support from Amazon**. Corretto is **certified using the Java Technical Compatibility Kit** (TCK) to ensure it meets the Java SE standard and is available on **Linux**, **Windows**, and macOS. It includes patches from Amazon that have proven useful in **running our own services**. &amp;#x200B;
Yes, I agree.
The JRE itself is deprecated. Java 9 introduced the module system which was intended to well, modularize libraries such as the JDK itself. To package a runtime with your application, the intended way is to use jlink. But adoption of modularization has been terribly slow, which means that a lot of applications still run with the trusty old classpath and they use a full JDK to run (which contains the JRE part). For Oracle's OpenJDK however, there is still a Docker image with a JRE in it, but it's not a separate download I believe.
Thanks again for sharing your views. We are considering [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) in our Organization. It is a no-cost, multi-platform, production ready distrubution of OpenJDK with long-term support from Amazon.
According to [the Java SE support roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/java-se-support-roadmap.html), &gt; Oracle will continue to provide free public updates and auto updates of Java SE 8, until at least the end of December 2020 for Personal Users... . Personal Users continue to get free Java SE 8 updates from Oracle at java.com (or via auto update)... Oracle does not plan to migrate desktops from Java SE 8 to later versions via the auto update feature. 
You could try changing to a Java 8 from one of the NON-Oracle sources on this list.

&gt;professional That is really good to know! thank you!
Thank-you!
How do you think project loom will affect reactive stream implementations such as Reactor and RxJava? Complement them or make them obsolete?
I have used Eclipse professionally for about 12 years, and for playing around a few years longer than that. I find it to have everything I need and more. It's free$ and also FREE(dom). Updates once were once a year, but lately seem to be twice a year or more. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for that explanation. So if I have a new PC and want to use JDK 11 for free, is it a good course to use the AdoptOpenJDK?
Check out [Jenv](http://www.jenv.be/).
Gitpod is an IDE with dockerized development environments: https://medium.com/gitpod/bring-your-own-docker-image-to-gitpod-52db1aa861de Disclaimer: I work on Gitpod
I think those libs need to be radically re-considered. The back-pressure stuff is worth keeping but the async nature will likely no longer be needed.
Eclipse. * available free of charge * many tutorials are written with screenshots of eclipse * it is well documented and has a strong user community * it is almost an industry standard, so if you learn it well you will be ready to develop at most jobs you go to
So is Java SE the same as the jre?
Yeah, it has a great potential to disrupt the whole jvm reactive ecosystem.
[jdk.java.net](jdk.java.net) is considered an Oracle source since the builds do come from Oracle. They even have their logo at the bottom.
AdoptOpenJDK is a safe longterm solution yes. Oracles OpenJDK is also totally fine if you don’t mind not getting updates after 6 months or upgrading to 12 after 6 months.
Thank you very much!
Was recently involved in a project that used byteman, what would you say is BBs advantage?
Ever since I started using intellij I never looked back!
Take a look at [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) as well.
As someone who works at Oracle on the JDK (i.e. OpenJDK), I’d like to point out a couple of things, as the interviewee was someone who directly benefits from any fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding Java (but this is not an official comment, and I speak only for myself): * Under the old BCL license the Oracle JDK was a mix of free and commercial features. Using the commercial features required explicitly turning them on with the flag `-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures`. You could not use them accidentally. Current JDKs no longer contain any commercial features, as explained below. * Starting with JDK 11, [Oracle has completed open sourcing the JDK](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later), which no longer contains any commercial features. Rather than a mixed free/commercial license, Oracle now offers the same software under two different licenses, the commercial OTN license, intended for those who wish to but a support subscription from Oracle, [and a free and open-source license](http://jdk.java.net/), for those who don't. The commercial license [download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) clearly states the different options, and links to the free option: &gt; * **Oracle Customers and ISVs targeting Oracle LTS releases:** Oracle JDK is Oracle's supported Java SE version for customers and for developing, testing, prototyping or demonstrating your Java applications. &gt; * **End users and developers looking for free JDK versions:** [Oracle OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/11/) offers the same features and performance as Oracle JDK under the [GPL license](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html). * That Oracle now only offers six months of free support (as oppsoed to before) is misleading. For at least the past seven years, Java had a major release every 3 or so years, and "update releases" (containing substantial new features, but no language or API changes) [every six months, plus quarterly security and bug fixes](https://java.com/en/download/faq/release_dates.xml). The releases were also not supported for more than six months, and to be up to date on security, one was always required to upgrade to the semi-annual update releases. What changed recently, due to community demand, is how the features are distributed among the releases. There are no more major Java releases. The last one (ever) was JDK 9. Starting with JDK 10, the semi-annual releases are not major releases but "feature releases," that are allowed to contain API and language changes, but are small, so that instead of a major upgrade every three years, the upgrade process is more gradual (e.g. compare [JDK 9](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/), the last major release, with JDK 11, [a feature release](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)). The feature releases are therefore somewhere between a major release and an update release but much closer to the latter. While major releases were supported for a number of years and the feature releases only for six months, the feature releases are by no stretch of the imagination major releases. * Similarly sized runtimes/languages -- Apple's Swift/iOS, Google's Android and Microsoft's .NET -- are all part of ecosystems entirely or largely under the control of the companies owning the projects, and that generate billions of dollars annually, and so fund the development of the platform. Oracle has no control over the Java ecosystem, and so must fund the development of OpenJDK somehow. This is now done by offering long-term support for some of the feature releases, for companies that don't wish to upgrade to every feature release (in the past the funding came partly through the commercial features, which have now all been open sourced, and the annoying search toolbar that came with the JRE, which is gone now, too). * Oracle employs hundreds of full-time developers who manage the OpenJDK project and [contribute the lion's share of OpenJDK development](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/building-jdk-11-together). While Oracle developers will continue to contribute most of the work, including security updates to current OpenJDK versions, they will not commit to backporting those contributions to old feature releases via OpenJDK's "JDK update" projects. Other companies have said they will do that work, so that there will likely be OpenJDK update releases for some feature releases, probably those that correspond to Oracle's LTS versions. Oracle encourages other members of the OpenJDK community to contribute even more.

Ah, you're right!

No problem! I just didn't want people to get confused.
BTW, *all* OpenJDK builds are released under the same license and owned by Oracle.
Yep!
JHipster is too verbose, I'd stay with Spring Boot. Easy to start and a lot of things working out-of-the box. 
Me neither.
Java SE = the Java platform, which defines what goes into a JRE and a JDK JRE = the software you need to run a Java program JDK = the software you need to develop and run a Java program, which is a superset of the JRE 
Just be sure you are getting **Open**JDK, not **Oracle**JDK under the Oracle Binary License Agreement. Or said differently, DO NOT go to [java.oracle.com](https://java.oracle.com), unless you understand what you are doing.
Pretty much every keynote at any largeish Java conference in the past year has been about this. 
There is no such thing as a major version anymore, and "LTS releases" are an Oracle JDK concept. Other OpenJDK community members may decide to backport various fixes to OpenJDK "update projects" and it is those that AdoptOpenJDK builds under the name "LTS". The community can choose to run an update project for any feature version, but it seems like those will correspond to the Oracle JDK LTS versions.
Thank you for the thorough explanation.
mooc.fi, they have a java course which is quite easy to follow, everything is very well explained.

All I know for Windows is what they have on: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013 It looks like you have to purchase an OpenJDk subscription for OPS deployments. Developers can get a free copy each year with a developer account: https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/ It also looks like they're not offering the JavaFX packages, for some reason. :-(
Head First Java is my suggestion.
Just wanted to stop in and say your posts have been really solid reads. Thanks.

Out of curiosity, what are the use cases for something like this?

I think you're spot on as to why they were added. I've used them for similar bolt on features. An example would be a guava ForwardingCollection&lt;T&gt; that also implements Transformable. Transformable just needs one method that takes a Function from T -&gt; U. Then just loop over the wrapped collection and call apply for each element to get a ForwardingCollection&lt;U&gt; That's a rather trivial example, but it works. They "enhanced" your API out of the box. But it's rare that I use them.
I use it for reverse engineering.

I used eclipse for years. It is pretty good out of the box but can be pretty fragile when you start installing plugins. After switch to IntelliJ I will never go back. It just works.

Effective Java, 3rd Edition, by Joshua Bloch
I mean that's lots of businesses' tech stack. That doesn't say anything about what you're actually trying to build. You can build using that, sure. No other input we can give really.
For context, my last experience as a day-to-day programmer was when Spring was initially released and there were no responsive frameworks around, so I'll be learning all this new stuff with this project. Is an additional tool needed to easily hook React to Cloud or they work pretty well together without an additional library to provide the "glue"?
I'm don't understand the question. React is a front end framework. Spring Cloud manages cloud-deployment problems like service discovery and load balancing. You can use them in the same project, but they solve totally unrelated problems.
Since this is built off of [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) what additional features of BB do you use that aren't present in ASM?
www.hackerrank.com (free) or Lynda.com (monthly fee). 
Have a look at jhipster. Just learned about it yesterday and have never used it but it seems like it should work pretty well
We use frontend-maven-plugin, which is configured to run yarn install/build in src/app (react source code) then some other maven plugin that I can't remember right now that copies src/app/build to src/main/resources/static. Make a controller that serves up index.html. Use rest controllers to serve up data to the react side. Biggest pain has been routing with a SPA and build times, but if you haven't changed the react code then pass -Dskip.yarn=true to maven. Spring seems smart enough to serve up static content when requested directly too.
Deploy React app in Nginx, deploy Java in tomcat\\jetty in boot, integrate with REST API. Simple, reliable, standard. Tons of guides how to do that on stackoverflow.
It's funny, but AdoptOpenJDK provide JRE for Java 11 [https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot#x64\_linux](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot#x64_linux) And it's working. I have a few projects currently working on this JRE.
Paid individual subscription to IntelliJ IDEA. Never seen anything better, working like a charm after Eclipse.
I would also suggest Head First Java. Although, it's a bit old. But it still has the bread and butter when it comes to java programming.
Effective Java, Clean Code, and Google's Guide to Testability by Misko Hevery.
This isn’t a book, but if you get in a decent place through a book you choose or thing you’re starting to understand the fundamentals I recommending codingbats.com. Not to sound like a r/hailcorporate, (it was a source I used in my first java class) but they’re pretty much just a spam of practice problems that help nail down your logic for the language.
Thinking in Java for me is the #1 hands down. You can that one read from cover to cover. It used to be free but I'm not sure if there's any up-to-date edition of that one.

&gt; where you're using it here It's used in multiple backend and cli (mostly internal) apps at walmartlabs cloud platform group. 
JHipster will generate a starting application that sounds like meets all your preferences. Here is a link to the web-based application generator: https://start.jhipster.tech/#
Do you have an example of such a guide? Would save hours of searching. 
Likewise here. If u know if any specifically, would be a huge help. 
Yeah I meant to say Boot / Rest instead of cloud. I imagine I won’t need Cloud until I need to scale and microservices become more numerous and complex. 
Although I would usually agree, this sounds way too advanced for someone struggling with constructors.
This is how we do it as well and use the maven resources plugin to copy build to static dir. Also, one doesn't need to explicitly serve up the request for index.html. Spring serves those by default. So you can just focus on your API controllers. To avoid routing issues, I hang all the API endpoints off /api and the use react-router to handle the others for the frontend. Since all the static content gets delivered on the first request, the browser will field all UI routing. As for calling the API endpoints from react, we use Ajax calls (axios) and have a setting for non Dev to use context root, otherwise, if process.env is development, I call the backend through localhost:port/api. This way I can have them running in parallel for development which is amazing. 
I strongly recommend this book: “A Developer's Approach to Learning Java: Read, Write, and Problem Solve Using Test-Driven Development” by Carol Wellington. It assumes no prior experience with Java. The labs in the first half of the book just have you typing in what’s in the book and observing it, and then it slowly starts having you fill in the blanks after that. I know a couple of people who had never programmed before who learned Java with this book. Seriously, I can’t give it a strong enough recommendation.
[Seriously, how many times per week does this need to be asked ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/search?q=book&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
There is no glue because what you're talking about are two completely separate applications. Your Spring Boot backend will serve REST/GraphQL endpoints and your React app will make queries to those endpoints for retrieving data just like any random accessible API on the web.
If you need to develop only restful apis and use orm Why not try jax-rs and hibernate?
Do the Helsinki MOOC. There is no better resource out there. Also you can find all the information you need if you check the sidebar on old reddit.
It's very powerful but overall the interface is extremely arcane and unintuitive. I think this may come from supporting too many features. 
I'm quite sure that Kathy Sierra is not a book :D You probably mean "Head first java"?
Java concurrency in practice by Brian Goetz. 
Absolutely agree "Head first java" is the best book for OP. Anyone suggesting "Effective Java" didn't read more than the post title
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46880853/deploy-create-react-app-on-nginx It was the first link I found in google. You can go step by step in googling things you need and come up with result, that's how development works. Read article and Google everything you didn't get from it. 
*Effective Java* assumes that you already have basic competence in Java, and is thus too advanced for OP. From the introduction: &gt; It is much the same with a programming language. You need to understand the core language: is it algorithmic, functional, object-oriented? You need to know the vocabulary: what data structures, operations, and facilities are provided by the standard libraries? And you need to be familiar with the customary and effective ways to structure your code. Books about programming languages often cover only the first two, or discuss usage only spottily. ... There are numerous books from which you can learn the grammar of the Java programming language... . Likewise, there are dozens of books on the libraries and APIs associated with the Java programming language. This book addresses your third need: customary and effective usage. 
Homeworks are for you to solve. If you got specific quiestions, ask. Good luck
Going to add to the "agree" chain for visibility. The Head First series in general are great books to learn a language. Effective Java, as suggested above, is too advanced for a first year with one month of class work as experience.
It was all very unclear before last summer and the source organisation has still not been satisfactorily explained from what I can tell. There was also very little information in text form, so it was left to the community to write about it. There was a lot of information from oracle about its own support plans and very little information about openjdk. You could argue that that's not their job, but it doesn't change anything
9, 10 and 11 are all major releases in the versioning sense - past 8 the java versioning scheme has been changed from 1.8 to actual 9.0.0 and so on.
[High-Performance Java Persistence](https://vladmihalcea.com/books/high-performance-java-persistence/) if you happen to persist data into a relational database.
JHipster is exactly wht you need. I am using it myself for my microservice application. All you have to do are some clicks and you are ready.
Maybe a good book but very outdated. Last version released 20/02/2006, while java 5 was the current release version. So many important features had been added since then. I strongly recommend newer books on more recent java versions, at least 8. &amp;#x200B;
You may not use it yourself but your dependencies might
Well he's gotta learn the basics anyway. It's not wasted knowledge. He can read that book and learn about new features introduced in java 7+ separately aftwerwards. 
IntelliJ
The [Java tutorials from Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) are universally viewed as being excellent. Go to the link, choose the topic you want to work on and go through it. 
Terrible advice to recommend a book that covers only through Java 6. 
Thanks everyone for the suggestions i have finally had an idea on what book to get. The majority of you suggested head first while effective java being the second one but for advanced Java programmers which is certainly not for me (yet). But others have also suggested other books which i will also take a look at. Thank you once again :D
Try Go. Start here: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1
Also, as OP may find out soon, they are not only different frameworks but different languages and different areas of an application. You don't need to get them to play nicely together. That's the whole point of separating them in this way
I have read the reviews for head first, its for someone who is new to programming and teaches the very basic. I have programming knowledge i know python very well along with other languages. Do you still recommend this book even though it would teach the very basic 
This is a question for **/r/learnjava**. Check out the *sidebar* there (old reddit view only). **Removed**
Head First Java hands down. Effective Java is good for someone with at least one year of experience IMO.
1. The official JDK terminology called 7, 8, and 9 "major releases" and 10, 11, 12 etc. "feature releases". 2. Releases 10, 11, 12 etc. *mean* something very different from 7, 8, 9. So whatever you call them, they are something very different.
Of course it's their (our -- I work at Oracle) job. OpenJDK is, after all, run and developed by Oracle. And I agree that written communication has not been stellar, but for years now the major communication medium for Java information has been conference talks.
Did concepts like oo and how constructors interfaces and abstract classes, threads change since then? This book is incredibly good for that. Nothing was removed from the language since the book was released.
you're asking for something awfully specific. GUI to what? Getting tweets using their api is simple. Writing to pdf is simple too but the combo of the 3 is probably not existent. Just use a rest client of your choice and pdfbox. You can write your own GUI with javafx/swing/etc. 
I meant desktop app not console.
Apache camel should be able to do this but it's not a GUI
Hi! Yes, this is a very good idea, I started my relationships with Java same way!! But I recommend you to start with FXGL - this library used in some UK universities to teach programming. It is simple and (compare to others) does not depend on native libs (it can be painful, especially on Mac). Other choices can be LITIengine or Slick2D, but they lack of documentation. I started myself with Slick2D in 2015, but today it is better to use FXGL. While you may have the idea for your game, I recommend you instead to go on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and search for game jams. These jams are scoped and have deadlines so you would be motivated. Also, you could submit your game and other people can test it and judge your results. P.S. and don't listen people who suggest you to start with console games. Console games are boring, unusual and they destroy your motivation from the first minute of coding. You can use ready free resources from opengameart or similar websites so you can do your game alone without designers or artists. Also, game development boosts your OOP and data structures understanding. &amp;#x200B;
1) Separate projects for Front-end (React and npm) and Back-end(maven/gradle with spring) In this case they can be in different repos. + They are separate and that's how it should be. Your Back-end exposed to the entire world through API and which client will consume this API doesn't matter. I.e. it may be not only web-client, it may be android/iOS app etc. - They are separate so they will be builded and deployed separately. - It needs to be synced features for both server and clients (web). * Usually last con means that it should have good documentation so it can be considered as a good thing. 2) Aggregate npm to maven/gradle using frontend-maven-plugin or exec plugin with npm tasks. + Single project, single repo + You can build server and client by one command and deploy both of them. + To fix something on other side you don't need to switch project. - it's just not really right solution through its can be handy for small projects it can become problem in the future. So at some point project will move to firat solution.
As someone else said bellow, the best option is to deploy the front-end and back-end separately (react on nginx, Spring on a tomcat). This will give you a very nice decoupling, you won't have to rebuild and redeploy the Spring app for changes in the front-end :) &amp;#x200B; We had this kind of decoupling even with JSF and it worked like a charm. 
Hi! Javalin and Sparkjava are good choices for beginners. They are simple, also quite powerful. If you have an experience with JS frameworks like Express you already know 90% of SparkJava. They are much easier to configure than Laravel and of course much easier than Spring (Spring in my personal opinion is developer-unfriendly). You can give a try for Blade MVC - since you have a proficiency with Laravel you may found this framework's concepts familiar to you. 
React app will be converted(by npm tasks) to plain old html-javaScript-css so it's pretty same as serving static web pages.
I used ByteBuddy briefly in a project once. While I can't compare its functionality to byteman or pure asm, I have to say the author was extremely helpful in resolving any issues I had and took the time to checkout my projects and trying it out locally to see if I was doing something wrong or if there was a bug. Multiple times for different issue. Great support!
This. Alternatively, if you use Gradle, it's relatively straightforward to add the yarn or webpack commands to your build process, with the target directory in your resources folder.

Does anyone know whether netflix moved entirely (or moving towards that) to node.js? There are several posts and talks in node.js conferences regarding this.
Because the frontend needs to be responsive. 
You mentioned finding it difficult to pass parameters and use constructors which are core concepts of python too, so are you just having issues with the syntax? There's no issue with buying a book and skipping the first few chapters if you find it's repeating knowledge you already have, the vast majority of the book you will find useful though I think. See if you can find some excerpts online first before you invest if you are unsure
There's no problem integrating react with jax-rx Both are independent to each other..
Second this approach, we do the same including backend calls at /api. For smaller / less complex apps, it's just faster to bundle it all in static and let Spring do the work. I'll have to check out that Maven plugin... we've been using Exec Maven Plugin and hanging the npm scripts off of the Maven lifecycle (e.g. frontend tests run during mvn test), but curious to see how the plugin you mentioned operates.

Intellij
Also, welcome to the FLAME WAR!!! My IDE is better than yours and you're a poo poo head for not agreeing with me. Here is a subjective description of my experience which I'm going to treat as though it was a peer reviewed scientific analysis. Now I'm going to go do something sexual to your mother because you disagree with me. 😂😂😂
[https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0)
I'm not sure what's your goal here: 1. For your IDE, you can just have separate JDKs unzipped, and then configured as runtime in your IDE, providing you a correct JDK for your project (e.g [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-build-jdk.html) or [Eclipse](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13635563/setting-jdk-in-eclipse)). 2. To run the apps, you'd just have a Dockerfile with a correct version of the JDK/JRE, build the container, and run it 3. If you are worried about your build tooling, e.g. Maven supports multiple JVMs with it's [toolchains](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) feature
To the limit of my knowledge Netflix reasoning was that they are migrating to spring because it has what they need, instead of having to create their own libraries. Having said that, I get the feeling they want to promote Node.js internally.
They still use Java for anything with a serious QPS requirement, and I doubt that will ever change. The stuff moving to Node are simple REST API's called by the client-side web code. The sort of things that most experienced Java devs don't really care about writing anyway. Of course, yes... at my company too there are a few client-side developers, who post things to Slack all day long about how Netflix is "full-stack JavaScript" and we should do that too. There were some flamewars and trolling initially, but it's mostly shrugged off now. As long as technical leadership understands the real picture, and doesn't fall for hype spam, I don't worry about it. Just script kiddies trying to push for pay bumps and some resume bullet-points.
That is the perfect name for this tool. Damn hipster developers and their trends. I’ll be over here with my J2EE 5...
[removed]
Fair enough! Just figured it was worth mentioning for future use if nothing else 
&gt;Micronaut Looks interesting, thank you for sharing!
This is the same feeling I get. It seems they are dropping a lot of java stuff, and just going to use spring so they wouldn't invest more time into java tooling.
I don't think there's a good and comprehensive tutorial for setting up a full stack project because it contains many steps and decisions which can be done by any developer. The actual implementation is just a fraction, maybe 10% of the work, the rest is DevOps starting with version control, containerization, CI/CD. Just start small, and create a REST API with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/). Then you create a separate [React app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you have come so far, we can talk again.
How about people don't use stuff they didn't pay for?
You need to watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3HkCF0jBZA). It explains everything. Netflix is primarily a Java shop, but the teams are free to pick other languages but in doing so, they are also partly responsible for the tooling, infrastructure, etc. they need for choosing a specific language. 
&gt; We are a failed species. That escalated quickly. 
More than likely Elon is just busy running a couple of other companies. He has these other companies called SpaceX and Tesla. I know they are small and never in the news, that is why you may have never heard of them.
React and Spring do play great together, except for Server-Side-Rendering. If this is a public app and you need any SEO, you will need node to render the app on the server.
There’s plenty of material of them online. None of it holds water 
Hey, homie :D
In my opinion Eclipse and Intellij are the best ones. At the beginning is liked Eclipse the most because I hated the file synchronization feature that Intellij has, that consumes a lot of memory on large projects. But then I realized it could be disabled and sync manually (just like Eclipse) so now I use Intellij. 
Yo man, what's up?

Works for me now
Spring Boot can produce a quick Java framework for REST APIs. It's also a great platform when you're ready to move beyond prototyping by adding security, database, etc. 
I appreciate what you posted. Thanks to Oracle for completing the open sourc'ing of Open JDK. And thanks for Oracle's contribution of developer hours on Java and updates. The problem may be more of perception than reality. And this is a problem that Oracle should take seriously. But IMO, just IMO, I don't think they care. As for Apple's Swift/Cocoa, and Google Android, etc, and let me just throw Red Hat and Azul Systems in here too, the difference is that I have a certain level of trust for those companies. I understand that they are publicly traded capitalist corporations who must increase shareholder value. So I don't have any delusions that Apple and Google do anything out of the goodness of their heart. With Oracle and Microsoft, I do have a problem of trust, and I don't think I'm the only one. They both took a long time to build up a climate of fear and distrust. I don't tend to want to do business with and shake hands with someone I don't trust. No matter what the contract says. THAT is the problem. One that Oracle should take seriously. Why do people perceive them as bad? It's not a technical or technology problem. It should not reflect poorly on the talented developers employed by Oracle. If I were one of those Oracle developers, I would have a difficult time not taking it at least a bit personally when reading all the negative things said about Oracle.
What do you mean by QPS?
Guys these are just projects with functionalities they needed and there weren't any libraries available at the time, so they developed them themselves. But now there are better alternatives and that's why they're stopped development on their libs and replaced them. They're still running mainly Java.
&gt; I am not looking to start a war. If you mention nodejs and java on the same thread you're gonna start a war it's inevetible.
&gt; What do you mean by QPS? Found the JavaScript developer! It's a very common load-testing metric for systems that must scale: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queries_per_second
Queries per second
JAX-RS and Jersey are perfect for that. You can write anything from RESTful services to full webapps. Checkout [https://github.com/ArjMart/API](https://github.com/ArjMart/API) and [https://github.com/ArjMart/ArjMartWeb](https://github.com/ArjMart/ArjMartWeb) for examples.
It seems there is no support for Linux x86 ie 32 bit linux architecture.
Thanks. Watching now.
Javalin, Java Spark

I don't really have much experience using node or Java, especially at scale, but why is Java stronger, do you think, for handling more queries per second than node?
Since Spring is written in Java and runs on a JVM, I'm not sure what you mean. You can't really drop "java stuff" in that context.
Dropwizard, because it is production ready, and has an excellent name.
Thanks

sight... What I meant was that they stopped developing most of the libraries they used in their production. They also announced that they are moving to use Spring as a replacement for those libraries, as there is no more need to have Netflix ones. Which makes perfect sense if Spring completely covers their needs. Whats more, if they contribute to Spring, its even great. However, you would do the same thing if you would want to migrate to a different stack. Just had a general wondering.
I just asked if somebody knew something, that they could share. For some, it felt like I killed their baby, their parents and burned their house... Nevertheless, I got a a link to a talk, thanks to /rellbits, so at least I got my question answered.
One of the reasons is that Java is multi-threaded. This means that if you have a CPU-heavy task you can often break it into parts that run in parallel. And if you have data that can be cached you can share that data across multiple threads. Another is that Java is compiled with real types. This allows it to run faster, possibly much faster, than JavaScript. While JS optimization has improved remarkably, there are still theoretical capabilities in Java that JS can never match. (And if we want to be honest, C# is a step up from Java in theoretical optimizations because of all of the value type work they've been doing.) 
The presentation I saw was just using Node as a gateway to the real services written in Java. They implied that what they were using it for could have been done with a particularly advanced, but otherwise off-the-shelf gateway/API proxy software like you see in a third of the booths at any computer security conference.
Jooby
yes
Why does Eclipse tell you not to do it then?
Then your Eclipse is configured in a weird way. The default code style that Eclipse recommends is to capitalize class names. Also, according to that codestyle, variables, fields and methods should be lowercase.
Intresting.. ok thanks for the info! I took C++ before this and our instructor always did camel case so its just confusing to see that thats the reason I didn't get a 100
Java has [coding conventions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf). Most teams start with the Oracle set and then adapt or add to them as needed. What's never changed, though, is that class and interface names are always \`UpperCamelCased\`. &amp;#x200B; It's unlikely Eclipse told you to not capitalize it because Eclipse warns you that class names should be capitalized whenever you create or rename a class.
I mean I got an 80% instead of a 100%.. We can only turn it in once and as he said "only get one bite at the apple" meaning he only grades it once as well &gt;Conventions are there to keep the ecosystem consistent. Just got out of C++ I just didn't realize it
Thanks for the info, I had no idea! &gt;It's unlikely Eclipse told you to not capitalize it I couldve swore it was saying the error when it was capitalized, but maybe I have it backwards then? I was just looking for a second opinion, im just mad cause he never gives me a 100 but its cause I keep making mistakes.. He grades it once and thats it
You would determine different answers for your question depending on what you are trying to process. Node is lightning fast but single threaded, Java is slightly slower but is multithreaded (but is still pretty damn quick). If you asked node to do some really heavy computations then you would slow it right down. I like to think of it like this: "which is better, a Ferrari or a rally car? Depends if you are driving through a field or not"
I've written a few tutorials that might help: 1. [Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and React](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/12/06/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-react) 2. [Use React and Spring Boot to Build a Simple CRUD App](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/19/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot) 3. [Full Stack Reactive with Spring WebFlux, WebSockets, and React](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/09/25/spring-webflux-websockets-react) The first is just read-only, but the 2nd shows read+write and how to handle CSRF. The 3rd shows how to use Spring Security's OAuth support for WebFlux. Please let me if you have any questions. All tutorials show how to develop the frontend and backend as separate apps. The CRUD one shows how to package them in the same artifact with Maven if you want to go that route. Finally, I work on JHipster and recommend you take a look at it. Here's a React tutorial I wrote for JHipster: 4. [Build a Photo Gallery PWA with React, Spring Boot, and JHipster](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/25/react-spring-boot-photo-gallery-pwa)
I had a professor like that. Just stick with it. Eventually you'll get to know the professor better (especially if your major is CS) and the relationship gets better. Also, don't be afraid to schedule time with the professor during his office hours if you have any questions about an assignment. Most professors are more than happy to help explain a concept or work through a tricky section of an assignment with you if you ask.

Well, regardless of anyone's level of trust in Oracle (and, BTW, I personally don't like to talk about any corporations in terms of either trust or virtue, but, say professionalism), it is a fact that Oracle is the company that drives OpenJDK, and while we are happy to see other companies contributing, I think some of them, especially some big ones, are currently taking much more from this project (which is to say, from Oracle's work) [than they are giving back](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/building-jdk-11-together). As to the question of Oracle's "good will" reputation, of course we, as developers, are aware of the problem and we care, but we think Oracle has been doing a good job with OpenJDK, and if a step like the recent licensing situation is spun by some as anything other than what it is -- a change for the better for the entire Java community and for open source software in general -- then perhaps they are being less than fair. But I also think that if someone has gets a sense good will from companies whose business model is surveillance, companies that drive children to conspiracy theories, companies that eavesdrop on personal conversations, and companies that subvert democratic processes more than from Oracle, then I don't think that person lives in the same world as me.
Since it's for a mock, why not go for something like WireMock? Or do you need more?
Thank you, that was a helpful response.

I agree, it's a mean reason to deduct points...
Thanks for the kind words and great advice!
Hmm, yeah, maybe. The goal is to mock a third party API. I figured I can use something like Fiddler to get the responses, then mock them away. 
Direct link to replacements: &amp;#x200B; [https://spring.io/blog/2018/12/12/spring-cloud-greenwich-rc1-available-now#replacements](https://spring.io/blog/2018/12/12/spring-cloud-greenwich-rc1-available-now#replacements)
Yea I was suprised, haha guess thats how you learn
Note that the approach node uses in its runtime (reactor model - a single thread with a queue you can schedule tasks on) is quite useful for places where you wait for something, a lot - imagine a web service which aggregates results from several others. It's going to wait for data from network most of the time, it's much better to yield the thread for other processing, and organize some sort of a buffer + mechanisms like select/poll to wait until the data is available for further processing. In Java there are various projects which utilize this model, or rather its multithreaded variation (multireactor), the most famous probably being Vert.x.
Does this also apply for Oracle Open JDKs? Will JDK 11 (LTS) also get updates for more than 6 months?
No, the oracle OpenJDK binary that oracle produces will only be updated for 6 months. You’ll then need to swap to their commercial ORacle java 11 LTS or upgrade to their oracle OpenJDK 12 binary.
Thank you for clarifying that! Just one more thing: "LTS" seems to be related to Oracle. Does this term have any effect on the OpenJDKs by other vendors?
I cannot disagree with you. Yet the problem I describe remains. The companies described in your third paragraph seem to be perceived as almost heroes by some. One example I would point out of negative perception is the belief, if not maybe the reality that Oracle would be happy for people to mistakenly use something that requires payment, get audited, and then be pay a lot of money and get locked into an abusive contract. If it is not a reality, it is at least a widely held perception.
I can only speak about Java, and this is worth repeating, as that's what the article is about: * Old Oracle JDK versions did, indeed, contain a mix of free and commercial features (as well as field-of-use restrictions dating back to the Sun years), but using those commercial features requires explicitly adding the `-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures`. * Now that the JDK has been fully open sourced, there are no longer any commercial features, just two licenses to choose from, and the [download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for the commercially licensed distribution clearly states who the distribution is for, and sends those who want a free distribution to the [free version](https://jdk.java.net/11/). And even if you miss that and click "Download", or land directly on the specific version, there is yet another explanation, [this time as big warnings in a yellow box and a red frame](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) -- smack in the middle of the page -- again with a link to the free JDK. Is it possible that people add an `-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures` or miss highlighted warnings as well as all the public communication on the subject? I guess it is. I also think that Oracle could communicate better. But I also think it's helpful to remember that by "people" we're not talking about individuals but other corporations, and those accidents are perhaps better characterized as corporate negligence. And while some of us may get annoyed about all this nitpicking about licenses, it is also helpful to remember that like commercial software, open source software also relies on careful conformance to licenses, and companies that are negligent when it comes to commercial licenses are also probably negligent when it comes to open source licenses.
Is it just me or are more and more Java jobs focusing on writing API's for some frontend framework, like React or what not? I could swear am seeing less and less traditional webdev (non-API) Java jobs and less and less Java Android jobs in recent years. Is this a thing or am I just being crazy?
Definitely a thing. Even in the rails or django worlds, it's becoming way more common to have an api backend and react frontend.
r/titlegore
You might find [mountebank](http://www.mbtest.org/) useful. It's designed to mock out a real API for testing.
Me and my employer both maintain strict license compliance, both open source and proprietary. I can't speak for others, but I suspect most here also strictly comply with licenses. Because people want to be in compliance, that would seem to explain the repeated questions on this forum which seem to indicate that people continue to be confused. &amp;#x200B;
Theoretically you can use libraries like fastutil or trove4j in Java to reduce (un)boxing overhead for primitives. Nevertheless it would be nice to have reified generics that support value types like in C#.
* OpenJDK is under the [GPLv2 + CE](http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html) (whether you download the builds made by Oracle or other organizations). * Oracle JDK is commercial, and for those who buy a support subscription from Oracle (either directly for Java or through some other Oracle product).
C# 8.x is even looking at offering raw function pointers. They are like delegates, but can't refer to instance methods because they are literally just a jump address.
I agree that Oracle can communicate better, but that others intentionally or not actively spread confusion is also a factor. I think that people *want* to feel like it's a trap to confirm their existing beliefs. As a trap it's a pretty bad one, what with all the warnings and fences and sirens that you'd have to ignore to fall in, not to mention how easy it is to get out. That page has always been the download page of the Oracle JDK, and that has always been the download page for those who buy a support subscription. As the OpenJDK builds are new, those were put on a new page.
&gt; Just got out of C++ I just didn't realize it Classes in C++ also start with capital letter.
Awesome cool I suck thanks have a good day
[micronaut](https://micronaut.io) may be an option.
&gt;Heads up, from now on you will always think of the nagging teach whenever you create a new Haha yea I won't forget it now
The last thing I read about this case, written by a lawyer, said that this case isn't actually about the copyrightability of API's at all. Instead it's actually about the copyrightability of a specific set of API definition files that originally came from Sun owned code, and at one point existed, unaltered, in Android's code. The court held that just because API's aren't copyrightable doesn't mean that those files can't be protected by copyright. It is clear from examination of the files that, rather than re-implementing the API from its specifications, the definition files were copied directly to the new code. Of course, it was first disputed that, since the files only implemented the API specification, they would not be copyrightable. After the court decided that they were copyrightable, Google gave another defense that, again, since the files only implemented the API specification, using them was fair use. That is, there is no point in protecting the copyright of files that implement an unprotectible specification. So far, the court has ruled against that claim as well. Of course, who originally copied the files is something I haven't gone into. It may have been the Apache Harmony project; it may have been Android (before it was bought by Google); it may have been Google themselves (though that seems late enough in the development to seem unlikely). It's rather a lot of money to be involved over what amounts to a technicality, considering that the files could easily have been replaced (and now have been) by ones that definitely didn't violate copyright with no change in functionality of the software. It's also rather late to get all those damages considering that Sun publicly gave Android their blessing before Oracle bought Sun.
LTS is a bit of a strange one but all of the OpenJDK vendors have a gentlepersons agreement (for now) that LTS means every 6th release (or 3 years). So Java 11, 17, 23 etc + the special case of Java 8. Most vendors are roughly matching Oracle's LTS offerings in terms of timeframes as well.

If you can use Apache, 10.0 has JDK 11 support. However, if you have to use a pre-Apache version, you might be limited to an earlier version of the JDK. (Source: [https://jaxenter.com/apache-netbeans-10-0-jdk-11-154014.html](https://jaxenter.com/apache-netbeans-10-0-jdk-11-154014.html))

Please i was developing android we mars 2 , now i can't setup android environment with 2018-12 release if you please i have lake on time .
Feeling pretty similar to you I think. A computer networking major with background in a little Python, Cisco equipment, and Windows Server and Linux background. I just started a certificate program in Computer Science after a couple of years working in platform engineering / Windows Server and with just 1 class at a time I feel I can really get it down this time! Good luck with your studies!

Scala or Kotlin?
Android is moving to Kotlin. Other than that; server side HTML rendering is almost never done anymore (on new projects): it's generally better to separate the front-end and back-end. An additional benefit is that a REST API can serve both a web app and mobile app just fine.
They're going through what many companies are going through; people experimenting with different stacks. I've seen the same with a few clients, mainly driven by developers wanting to try something new. Eventually almost all of them will figure out having a huge range of tech stacks is not a good idea for any company, and that using Node.js on the back-end is just a bad idea altogether. There isn't really anything the Node ecosystem does better than the Java ecosystem.
You can do this with any framework, so I'd just use whatever you guys have most experience with. But why not something like Wiremock? It's created for use cases like this.

Who else is going to fund Larry’s third yacht?
+1 for Javalin, I use it a lot for mocking APIs. It's really fast and simple to get started with.
Why
Why what
No one really in programming goes and gets certs outside of IT and Security.
I'm doing a tech apprenticeship and industry certs are part of the course
I think 99/100 developers and managers will tell you that development certs are 100% useless. I feel the same way. That said, I'd do the minimum required to complete whatever course you're taking. Are you not in the US? It may be different overseas.
Do the Professional SE7 instead. You miss out on the streams API, but there are other, still valid, parts of the language dropped from the syllabus. It was certainly the case for me that my employer considered the two exams to be equally relevant. Worst case, if your company is paying you can take the SE8 Associate exam, it shouldn't be any less trivial than the SE7 now that you've passed it. 
Overseas it's the same. Java certs are only useful when you're a fat-ass corporation and you need to brag before your clients that you have an army of mindless certified code ~~monkeys~~ artisans.
Is the professional SE7 exam still available? I only found the SE8 online. Worst case scenario I have to re-sit the associate but I'd rather not have to do that
Yeah I agree but its part of what I have to do so I have to just suck it up and do it. Just hoping I don't have to do the associate again. I'm in Ireland btw
Ah, sorry, I don't know. Now that I think about it, it must be about two years since I sat the exam, so they may well have deprecated it
Certain customers only hire corporations with a minimum amount of certified developers, regardless of what we think about such certifications. Also some companies only provide support to customers who get their devs certified on their products.
I find this article very confusing, especially the parts about Java being the first language to support multiple platforms (I think interpreted languages were first) and garbage collection: it was made available in Lisp \~40 years earlier.
Do people actually value these? Honest question. I had Java cert awhile back and it seemed employers put little weight towards it.
Yeah you're right. These certs just means you have an understanding of the language not that you can actually code. So I can see why employers don't really care about them
I'm an Oracle Certified Professional Java SE7 person here. I got the cert because I was trying to break into the industry without a CS degree. Let me tell you, it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on to employers. That being said, as a self taught developer, getting that cert forced me to step my game up in a big way and become way, way better at my job. Those skills still serve me well today.
**Rules** **Do not post tutorials here!** Also, please have somebody check your spelling and grammar before posting. Both are horrible.
You don't own the data, can't replicate it, and you want to index it for low latency searches? Does the 3rd party have a search API? Sounds like you'll be wrapping that.
Just another article written by an uninformed person masquerading as an 'expert'. Fake it till you make it.
Can you store some sort of hashed representation of the data? Is the data textual? Numeric? Structured?
Use something like Hazelcast to build a distributed in-memory cache, and RAM prices are the limit.
I guess you can just implement a Spring service which calls the API, but has `@Cached` annotations on its methods so the call will only actually be performed once. 
&gt; stands as one of our greatest examples of coding kung fu The warning sign was helpfully right in the first paragraph
How large and what search features do you need and what availablility? Suggestions can range anywhere from distributed in-memory (at which point it is a DB), to local JVM structures, to FTS sqlite :memory:, etc. I mean, if ElasticSearch is running on RAMDisk, then what? Reqs need clarification because you're always storing data somehow or you're just a proxy.
You can use lucene and keep data in memory
You could still use ES with only searcheable data indexed, if that is oikay with your third party, and then query for some ID on the third party service to retrieve full data for the user. Anyway, this contract is fucked up. You can not even have some cached data with such restrains :/ I even wonder if you are authorized to merly log some of those data for debug purpose (data is then actually stored on some file :/)
Fresh workspace Fresh install IntelliJ
Uhm What?
Check the JDK settings and make sure it's pointing at an actual JDK and not the JRE. 
It is. I was using JRE - and it was working - Then I switched to JDK to use ANT and now it's not working either with JRE or JDK
Go crazy and run solr on RAM disk. Seriously, RAM storage is actually a storage too. So, if You can't use any storage, RAM is also forbidden. I assume, You are just missing the point of your contract.
Actually, I can use cached data.
The data is textual
Daniu, I can cache the API. But my question is , how should I implement a search framework with the cached data. Suppose I search a keyword - "Java Engineer" and I have 100 third party APIs that gives Job posting data. And in the end I get total of 1000 jobs . How should I implement Job relevance according to the keyword and how should I rank the search results if I am not using ES.
I am actually implementing a Job portal. Suppose I search a keyword - "Java Engineer" and I have 100 third party APIs that gives Job posting data. And in the end I get total of 1000 jobs . How should I implement Job relevance according to the keyword and how should I rank the search results if I am not using ES or any other search frameworks that stores data. Also how should I match the results if there was a typo mistake by the user. Should I use Java String manipulation? That doesn't feasible. &amp;#x200B;
Cool series. But in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, 'how much do I trust someone that uses a light theme for their IDE?' ;)
I'm assuming you mean some backend process that fetches a bunch of stuff and then needs to do a search on it locally but you don't want to keep what you fetched after the search. It's gonna be real slow (hence the backend assumption). For a small start, I'd just use sqlite w/ FTS ordered by rank. But why can't you put the results in ElasticSearch, do the search, and then delete if you must?
That’s really cool! Wish I was on the level of java knowledge to make a game! 😃
You can search through 1000 jobs in memory. You don't need any sort of search engine for such a small data set.
Oh my goodness. I dont know how I've never noticed that I've become......THAT person XD

Is anyone else sick of seeing low effort content on this subreddit? Specially this post. I do tend to keep my mouth shut, well lately I have been calling out things more, but after so many times seeing this guy push this time lapse of "game development" on this subreddit I had to say something. I would even vouch to say if you watched these videos of the time lapse and tried copying what he/she did, you'll most likely end up a worse Java developer. I know this is a bit mean to say but I do think it's true. Now I get the appeal. I get that it is fun to see a progression of a game being developed. Maybe if OP put more time into his video with commentary or even with words on what he is trying to accomplish and how he is going about it I could see this being not low effort and I could see it relating to this subreddit. But just recording, speeding it up, then publishing on youtube, then spamming subreddits to the video, just god why... I also know that you can't really enforce to stop low effort content because everyone determines low effort differently. I just want to see what others have to say. If I am in a minority I understand and will just block OP so I don't have to see the posts anymore. Finally I get where OP is coming from being he's created content, he wants as much views as he can get so he just spam posts on all subreddits "related" to the content to get more eyes on it. I have seen this post, on different subreddits, multiple times and some subreddits I will turn a blind eye because I could see it relating to the subreddit. I'm going to be in a similiar boat to OP when I get closer to launching/marketing my game. I just get a feeling there's gotta be a better way to go about this.
Yeah hopefully! Just started coding this week. So maybe within a year or two, I might be able to build something small! 😅
I've been wanting to make a game but it he tendering was flickering and I couldn't fix that to continue on with creating sprites (and classes for them)
I hope so! Keep working hard man itll come!!
If you have source code I could take a look and see if I can help :) 
Appears to be written by a web dev who knows a tiny amount of Java, which apparently allows him to call himself an architect. [This article](https://www.javaworld.com/article/2077874/open-source-tools/the-pathproxy-pattern--persisting-complex-associations.html?page=4) by the same author has some headache-inducing code. Why is `path.getSize(true)` called repeatedly? Does the result change for each invocation?!? Why not use a switch statement? Is it really necessary to clutter up example code with `if (log.isTraceEnabled()) { log.trace(...` every 5 lines??? Why does `CommonService.getCount` return a boxed long - when would the answer ever be null? Is it ever a good idea to log from within an equals method? 
I do appreciate your honesty, I agree if you tried to follow what I did you likely would be a worse developer because arent learning anything and I will fully admit that I do not know everything and there is very likely a better way of doing most of the things I do. The suggestion for commentary is noted, and is something I've been considering doing. As for relating to this subreddit the entire thing so far has been written in Java and this post is in the java subreddit. Seems like it's easy to see how it's related. I'm currently posting updates about these videos in 4 subreddits 1 of which is mine. I'd hardly call that spamming but if that's what you think then I'm sorry it bothers you. I appreciate that you can see where I'm coming from, I'm proud of what I'm managing todo without any formal education on the subject and I want to share that. I agree theres probably a better way of going about this but right now I've gotten a lot of positive feedback and advice doing things this way so if you find a better way feel free to PM me and let me know :) 
game engine separate from game or no?
Nope!
Reminds me a lot of when I made a text RPG called Nubanon. So many constructor calls for items
Oh man yes 0.o only have like 5 items but still so many and so many to come
Maintainer here. Not all of spring cloud Netflix is going into maintenance mode, specifically eureka client and server and concurrency limits (new feature). &amp;#x200B; As stated in the blog most projects had long been in maintenance mode in netflix already, Hystrix was just the last.
If you think that's low effort you're out of your mind of you've got your bar set to a level that's aimed at employees and not internet hobbyists. Good job OP.
Did you use the standard java 2d graphics library for this? 
I searched through my uni’s library and found head first java and picked it up. Got to say, i have learned alot even though im into a few chapters. The fun layout and teaching is what gets me hooked rather than going through tons of writing.
Yes I did:) 
Thank you :) I really appreciate this comment :) 
It's not my favorite content, but it might be inspiring to the non-wageslave part of the community. The good thing about reddit is that the communities are more or less self-moderating, I think you should downvote the posts instead of blocking the poster. 
I don't want to diminish what OP is creating. The game itself is aspiring how far it has come and for many other reasons but the content in which he displays it I just find that low effort. Though I say this without producing such content myself so I know it is a bit hypocritical. &amp;#x200B; Yeah I do think my bar is set to a level probably where it shouldn't be considering the context. When I type these comments that I know have a negative outlook on something I usually end up deleting them because there's really no point in me putting that negative energy out there. Like /u/tipsypants said I probably should had just down voted and moved on with my life but here I am. But I don't know. I also think it's important to be able to voice your opinion to make community better when you see "flaws". 
Even for saying nothing at all (no mention of a JIT!) he still gets things wrong. Newbies, don't rely on anything in this article. 
I think there's always room for amateurs to show off on the internet. That's one of reddit's biggest strengths. I think there's also always room to give constructivw criticism. I only downvoted you because you used the phrase low effort. I've been making games and programs in the terminal/console and once or twice with pygame and I only wish I was working on stuff that looked that good. It's all relative. If this post was pretending to be a tutorial that would be one thing but it was advertised as a timelapse and nothing more. And regardless of the coding practices used (I'm not good enough at java to judge) it demonstrates that you can make some cool looking stuff with the java 2d library. For someone on the fence about what technology to commit to that is a powerful endorsement. TL;DR Is all relative man. I can't wait to see your game when you wanna show it off and I'll definitely upvote it too.
Thank you :)

Javalin and Helidon are about the simplest. If you want to go one step up in features, Micronaut is a good choice. 
Reminds me of those videos of Notch coding games in java!
I take that as a compliment :D 
You could start by reading r/Java rules: [/r/Java](https://www.reddit.com/r/Java) is for News, Technical discussions, research papers and assorted things of interest related to the Java programming language, not for help with Java programming. Such "help with programming" posts should go to [/r/javahelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp).
I know you are kidding, and it seems to be the cool thing to use the dark theme, but I just can’t read it as easily. I find the light theme a LOT easier to see. 
Oh heck yeah! Definitely meant it as one :). Sick fluency in Java!
Me as well aha hence why im still using it! &amp;#x200B;
im honestly not sure if this is a serious comment or not...
Well thank you very much! i really appreciate it :)
Im getting re-certified for Java app development right now, I started using the dark theme because it's easier on my eyes personally, and everyone in my class calls me 'thay guy' for using it. Idk how we put negative and positive stigmas around using themes that are easier for some to read, whether that be light or dark, still boggles me.
From everyone i know its honestly just a personal preference and its more of a joke and way to playfully tease. ive never met someone who was trying to be mean with it XD 
Solution: Install Java SE Runtime Environment 1.7.17
I was going to write a big long post about how bad this is... but suffice it to say, the author is an idiot with no real knowledge of what or how the JVM works. This article is full of fluff, non-descriptions, and incorrect information. All written with absolute confidence and authority. You'll do better to read the wikipedia article on the JVM.
I saw someone use Comic Sans in their IDE on a daily basis. That person was a monster not to be trusted.
Meh. Netbeans works well with maven and I used it for years without issue. Maybe my biggest complaint about it is that the transition from oracle to apache took too long.
*shudders* 
I like netbeans, I've worked in other ides as well over the years but keep ending up back at netbeans. There are features of the other ones I liked more but I guess netbeans is comfortable and familiar

So I'm dead in the water... Understood. Deleting my account this site is useless.
Agreed. I use * imports whenever I can. And at least for the standard libraries, I urge fellow developers to do so too. 
Main point here - you **must** store the data somewhere to run queries, RAM is a storage as well. You need to figure out your contract problems rather than framework issue. I would suggest having isolated database instance which will be maintained following specific rules, maybe even with journaling enabled to cover potential legal issues. Since you can save data in some manner at least temporary, you can choose database as temporary storage and just figure out retention policies. Let's say under the contract you can't store data permanently - OK, check with someone from legal team what temporary mean in this case - 8 hours, 15 minutes, 20 seconds, just enough to do the search? Based on that you'll be able to setup database and data set retention policies.

That's great! It's quite different to most books and I have to admit I've only ever skimmed over it, but I always recommend it to the engineers I mentor at work and it has always helped them!
So cache the data in ES.

Hi, can I know how to get enough karma?
that's why I don't trust Google with Kotlin.. Its all about control. Today's Google is run by people with teenager size attention spans.
It is very important.
Use a RAM disk.
This is interesting. Why not - just out of curiosity - did you not use LWJGL or similar?
For anyone actually interested in starter game development Almas Baimagambetov's channel is much better than this. He puts up short tutorials building basic games from scratch with JavaFX. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmjXvUa36DjqCJ1zktXVbUA 
I didnt start this project as something I intended on publishing or making money off of, I did it because I enjoy programming and wanted to keep learning and I've worked with lwjgl before so I decided to do it this way instead :) 
I'm not trying to teach anyone, I'd hope a channel who is trying to teach does a better job than me. All I'm doing is sharing my work 
Where's your github link then?
So did 2018.2???? [https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/06/java-11-in-intellij-idea-2018-2/](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/06/java-11-in-intellij-idea-2018-2/) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It's a little different for that, basically your one is: * Intellij can now code &amp; run tests in Java11 This new post is: * Intellij IDEA (a java platform itself) can now run under Java11 This new one will be hopefully transparent/invisible to the user, but will allow jetbrains to move their code towards J11
Although the impact of certification on someone's earnings potential is an open question, I would disagree about the certification process being worthless. I worked at a massive firm (not in the tech industry) alongside several senior devs that did not realize the key to a HashMap is expected to be immutable - they assumed this was somehow taken care of by virtue of just defining a hashCode() method. Preparing for the certification process gets you up to speed on these types of concepts very quickly. Taking the exam is just the last leg of the process. In my opinion, a certification indicates that someone has spent at least \*some\* amount of time investing in themselves in a focused, verifiable way.
We work in an industry that moves so fast, the influence of a particular tech stack (e.g., Java/Spring) can quickly be considered 'old hat.' Several friends of mine who are Java devs at a bank mentioned a handful of their teams are switching from Java/Spring to Scala about 3 years ago. I thought this alone was a surprising move since financial firms that are known for moving at a glacial pace. This same firm is now considering only NodeJS for new web backends. The "framework of the month" syndrome is definitely spreading into the backend.
&gt; There isn't really anything the Node ecosystem does better than the Java ecosystem. From a technical standpoint, I might agree but the business case I've heard from management is that they can pay the frontend JavaScript dev to now also write backend JavaScript.
Can't fault /u/madkasse for that though, it really is a bad editorialization of the title.
It's basically the concept of a function calling itself. Here's a good little tutorial: https://www.javatpoint.com/recursion-in-java

[Here's a quick way to learn about recursion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/ao4bs8/about_to_learn_recursion/)
Yeah, and I can't imagine what would go wrong if you'd do that.
I prefer the fluent API it exposes. It also seems to be the preferred byte code manipulation library by big players (e.g. Spring Framework) after CGLIB has been "community deprecated".
I think NetBeans is good. I personally don't have experience with the other ones, but I see NetBeans recommended a lot by lecturers
I never liked eclipse so I can’t really tell you the downsides since I never used it. Netbeans however is a fantastic IDE for learning java. You get it for free, and it’s very straight forward with its use. It just works and that’s really nice. And while that seems a little stupid to say “it just works” but legit, the only thing that really frustrates me with ide’s is how hard and complicated they make writing and working on code. Netbeans is as straightforward as it gets. Just download it along with the jdk and it will be ready to go right out of the box.
IntelliJ IDEA 100% - accept no substitute. Eclipse and Netbeans are solid don't get me wrong but IntelliJ IDEA beats them hands down. JetBrains are the IDE experts. You also get the bonus that JetBrains make IDEs for lots of different languages all based on the same underlying engine. So once you've learned one you can switch to the others with ease. e.g. Android Studio, PHP Storm, Webstorm, PyCharm etc.
I think what might be helpful is for you to breakdown how you created simple objects. For example, those trees look wonderful. I would like to see how videos on how you used the simple Java 2d library to create the tree, the drawings or whatever tools etc, and how you put it together WITHOUT the rest of the game. This is a good way to think about game programming coupled esp with OOP in Java. If you teach that properly, I think most beginners would be able to recreate that same effect with many other objects. Like one OP said, it's cool to share your work but teaching a small lesson like that would help you to really share how you approached a problem (which is most important part of programming). 
To understand recursion, you have to first understand recursion.
Yes, there is a simple definition: recursion - see recursion If you are familiar with Fibonacci numbers, check this: [https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/23recursion/Fibonacci.java.html](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/23recursion/Fibonacci.java.html)
IntelliJ it is, thanks!
Am I true when I say you cannot store third party API datas in a readable way ? If yes then you could just hash every word of it, index every hash of every word and its reference in the API, and store the whole thing. This way no datas from your datastore would reveal original datas from the third party API. And you could still look for words by looking their hash in your database. The only limitation is that you won't be able to perform any fuzzy search query, but given the constraints I think this is quite acceptable :)
Netbeans is still alive. Who would have thought. Game development. Its on my bucketlist. Maybe i will create a game of tic tac to. So that i can say. Build a game, did that. 
Try all three (IntelliJ Community is free anyway) and use the one you like best. Also, next time, please ask *learning related* questions in /r/learnjava, programming related questions in /r/javahelp.
Very welcome. Some advice for you: 1) Go through the plugins list and disable **everything**. Then go through the plugins list again and enable **only the plugins that you need.** IntelliJ IDEA comes with everything and the kitchen sink but you'll probably only need 10% - 20% of them. (periodically revisit the plugins list every now and again as your skills/knowledge improve - enable anything that might be beneficial). This will minimize background processing and help keep your IDE smooth and snappy. 2) Play with your IDE - this sounds stupid but I frequently meet developers who use their IDE every day and have no clue about the wealth of functionality it offers. Play with all the settings, tweak all the things - try to discover everything it offers. Don't feel overwhelmed - there is a lot to discover but with a bit of time it'll all become familiar. Don't worry about breaking anything. Just delete the user settings folder/directory to reset everything back to default. 3) Try to avoid changing lots of the default key bindings (or keep the changes to a bare minimum). Instead try to learn the default key bindings/shortcuts for everything. There are 2 main choices - JetBrains defaults and Visual Studio defaults. Choose whichever you prefer. Frequently throughout your career you'll need to use an IDE on an unfamiliar system (coworkers computer, test server etc). If all the keyboard shortcuts are the same you can jump on and be immediately productive without having to mess with the settings. 4) Use the JetBrains toolbox to keep everything updated - it saves a whole lot of hassle. [https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/) 5) Best of luck learning Java. It's a wonderful, wonderful language - one of my favorites :)
It's a shame that this got removed. These sorts of newbie questions are still useful even if they are frequently reposted. It seems a shame to remove them when they'll just drop off of their own accord due to low votes.
The purpose of /r/Java is not about Java programming. /r/java's purpose is clearly defined as: &gt; News, Technical discussions, research papers and assorted things of interest related to the Java programming language &gt; &gt; NO programming help, NO learning Java related questions!

My bad sorry.
I use light theme on pretty much everything - I don't like the contrast change when I switch from monitor to just looking around in office lighting or out of a window. I guess I just like my monitor to match my surroundings, and I like to keep it bright.
Did you get your start with [Killer Game Programming in Java?](https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302) . The timing loop reminds me of reading that a while back, but I bet that's a common enough way to do it. 
That's last ressort and kinda troll... What about 1 and 2 ?
That's last ressort and kinda troll... What about 1 and 2 ?
help, stuck in an infinite loop due to no exit condition
Ans there's a comment suggesting storing hashed data if you have issues with long ter m caching
Man I love these presentations by Goetz
Hopefully it will be visible to the user by noticing better start-up times. JDK11 removed some bloat, hopefully IntelliJ did too with some refactorings.
lol, nice one
[MRW reading this.](https://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.jpg) Why not use a JSON-based data structure like Jackson's JsonNode to contain the data instead? It's not hard to implement the serde for converting between a custom object type to JsonB, whereas with this String approach, you're giving up the ability to leverage the Json functionality with your Java code.
I really want some of these bigger features to land. It's really hard using today-Java when tomorrow-Java looks like so much fun.
Recursion is great; some of the most elegant solutions to problems have recursive solutions. That said, you probably want to avoid recursion in actual code you run because you will find the call stack will quickly become a limiting factor.
lol
I wish we could get basic value types and fibers into jvm in 2019. These are the highest value (no pun intended ;) targets IMHO. 
I did not, honestly up until now I didnt know that was a thing XD. The timing loop I've worked on for about a year tweaking it to how I like it :) 
Thanks for the suggestion :) I've thought about doing a tutorial series but I've never gotten any schooling in the matter so I always figured no one would want to learn from me XD but I'll definatly reconsider if people are interested! 
Is there a text transcript somewhere?
I don’t believe so, but I’ll look.
[https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1) Here's some great practice questions for recursion that helped me a lot with learning recursion in Java.
It's amazing how much he can say in only 22 minutes!
You might be able to see better performance by enabling graalvm (if on linux)
One advantage I could see is that you could store data from a third party API for which you are not sure exactly what the structure would be. However, if you are integrating with an external API I would think you would at least have some idea of the structure of the data. It seems it would be more appropriate to use a Map&lt;String, ?&gt; or List&lt;?&gt; to store the data as opposed to just a string.
The easiest way is to write a converter class to tell Hibernate how to convert it. Check the *AttributeConverter* interface documentation.
That will not work if you need to pass it to the DB using `PreparedStatement#setObject`. Try it, and you will see why it does not work.
Just change the property to `JsonNode` or a custom POJO, and it will just work.
I agree, but question was about jpa and hibernate. In prepared statement you need to pass String value, because a database using text type to transfer it via jdbc. Explicit conversion is required to get a String from Json object.
At first I was like why is he talking about Futures in world of CompletableFutures. 
If you pass String to a JSONB column, PostgreSQL will throw an exception. 
My bad, I had an impression that you are using MySQL.
I struggled with recursion a pretty reasonable amount. To understand it, you really just have to force yourself to think of how you can perform an iterative operation recursively and try it out yourself. Whenever I implement it, it's usually either a last resort, or something I honestly think of writing recursively at first glance. In simple terms, I more or less think of it as the function being a loop itself, where the iterator is a parameter of the function in the first place. 
The [hibernate-types](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hibernate-types/) project is tested with both PostgreSQL and MySQL. For MySQL, indeed, you can pass the JSON object as a `String`, but in PostgreSQL, you need to pass it as a JDBC `Object`. This project covers more than just JSON. You can map PostgreSQL ARRAY, Enum, Inet, Range types or Jaba 8 `Year`, `Month` and `YearMonth`. If you're using Hibernate, you should definitely check it out.
Can't wait to watch this later.

Is there any way to use JUnit 5 with Spring Boot? As far as I can tell it's still using 4
Spring Boot 2 and JUnit5 are compatible afaik
been waiting for this to come out! They added a few features I requested dealing with floating point numbers.
I was mainly referring to spring-boot-starter-test. Sorry. It sounds I should forego the starter kit and go with manual setup
Still stuck on windows because of MS Teams :(. Fun but true story: the other day I saw a college download, install and configure Visual Studio Code while opening IntelliJ before splash screen!
That so recursive.
Since this is help with *Java programming* it should be posted in **/r/javahelp**. **Removed**
Nice.
Is there a plan to write transcripts of videos?
We are using jUnit 5.3 with Spring Boot 2.1, and it works fine, but you need to exlude the jUnit4 dependency from your build.
I’m not sure. If they are uploaded to YouTube, you might be able to get a transcript.

It's starting to look a lot like pytest.
You can definitely use Spring Boot and JUnit 5 together. Here is my project demonstrating as such: https://github.com/wkorando/WelcomeToJunit5

I'm sorry, I don't do much Android development- and I think I just barely used Eclipse to do it when it was Google's IDE of choice. Given that Google only supports Android Studio I would (regretfully) bite the bullet and use it.
We use gitflow in our java, nodejs, and angular projects. It's great for helping us manage our versioning, and branch tagging. It's pretty cool how it will figure out the version number of the artifact and update git with the next version (if applicable). One of the ways we should be using it more is by utilizing its branching model for features and hotfixes. We have way too much work being done on the develop branches instead of in feature branches that are pulled in when approved.
Does the AdoptOpenJDK not have anything that the Oracle JDK has?
[removed]
Get Java Development Kit - JDK.
No, it seems like you dont get it, I have this so called "SE Development kit" which I downloaded and after that it linked me to this, [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/overview-summary.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/overview-summary.html) and theres tons of stuff I have no clue what to do with.
Looks like it is just showing you the documentation. You don't need to pay attention to it. Are you able to run javac or java from command line?
Can you give one example? I don't want to read through all of the notes.
