Cool thanks.
Maybe mouseReleased consumed the event
I copied to code on MouseClicked() to MouseReleased() and it didn't do anything. Also, while the other MouseListener events doesn't seem to do anything, MouseEntered() still works.
Just glancing over this, I have a feeling the problem isn't the way that you're adding the listener (having an applet implement mouse listener and adding it to itself is fine; same as the example here:http://www.realapplets.com/tutorial/MouseClickExample.html). The problem is more likely that you've got your execution threads organized in a really confusing way and something probably isn't happening the way you think it is. It seems like you have a lot of complexity in your paint method that might not belong there, you have methods like start and stop that don't seem to do anything, and I'm not sure that there aren't infinite loops contained in the while(someBoolean == true) setup that you have going on there. It looks like in one place you're calling a method called ScreenUpdate from within the paint method, and that method goes on to subsequently call repaint() again; granted that repaint doesn't force entry into the paint method, but it's still probably not a good idea. I strongly suggest that you rethink this entire thing; otherwise you're just going to wind up with lots of bugs (like the one you're asking about) that can't easily be tracked down because the code isn't easy to read or logically organized. And that's totally normal, it usually takes a few tries to get something like this right. It's probably much easier to start over now that you've done it once than it is to keep working on what you have here, which is frankly very confusing.
Irrelevant to the discussion, but I only read the title and came here hoping for solutions to a quick check out at the grocery store.
&gt;The problem is more likely that you've got your execution threads organized in a really confusing way and something probably isn't happening the way you think it is. Yep, this fixed it. I took the loop off and suddenly mouseClick started working. now I just need to organize my loops. Edit: It seems that if I use a while loop anywhere, the MouseClick stops working. 
Sorry if that sounded snarky. :-) I'm assuming you are on JDK7, since I don't see LauncherHelper.java in open jdk6 (it has LauncherHelp.java). The line it's barfing on is 399 return mainAttrs.getValue(MAIN_CLASS).trim(); and mainAttrs was just checked for null. So it looks like it's not finding a value for main class. 68 private static final String MAIN_CLASS = "Main-Class"; Now, I'm on 6, so I can't check myself. But on 6 I can't make a one line manifest file. jar adds things like Manifest-Version: 1.0 Created-By: 1.6.0_26 (Apple Inc.) Are you sure that's the manifest in the jar file? Or is that your source for the manifest? If so, what's in the jar? Unzip it and check. My first guest would be that your manifest is not getting picked up properly. Unzipping and looking would confirm this. (jar will generate one for you, with no Main-Class. Which sounds like it would explain what is going on). Otherwise, I'd hexdump the unzipped manifest, and look for special characters. I'd also make sure there is a new line at the end of the file, as they are required by the spec. Just guesses, sorry. Best I've got, since I don't have 7 yet. 
Which UI toolkit are you using? [Here](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html)'s a helpful reference on AWT/Swing layouts, and [here's](http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-Understanding-Layouts/index.html) the equivalent SWT reference. If you're using SWT, the latest Eclipse release has a graphical layout tool which is pretty helpful for simple things, but will tend to mess up your code if you're doing anything other than what it expects.
No problem. I think I figured it out though thanks to help from chickenmeister. In the manifest.txt file I used to create the .jar, I did not include a newline character. This caused the MANIFEST.MF file to be created incorrectly. I looked at the MANIFEST.MF after creating a jar both with the newline character and without. When I included it, there were 3 lines: Manifest-Version 1.0; Created-By: 1.7.0 (Oracle Corporation); and the Main-Class line from manifest.txt. When created without the newline character, the MANIFEST did not have the Main-Class line. Thank you for your help. Silly how simply omitting a single press of the Enter key causes so many problems. 
We can only dream that Java will one day solve that problem for us.
Thank you for the link. The contents of the link cleared up a few things for me.
I've been doing all of my coding in jEdit and Netbeans in Mac OS X, and I am quite the fan of /n. My instructor recently complimented my use of /n which made me pretty happy. I am almost OCD'ish when it comes to breaks, spacing, etc. The link you provided was quite interesting. Thank you for that.
I've tried both Eclipse and Netbeans over the past few months, and I just can't bring myself to like Eclipse. But what you advised can be done in Netbeans also, so I'll give it a try. Luckily, I still haven't encountered anything that really really needed me to wrap it, but I know that I will eventually. 
Swing does all of its work on a single thread, the AWT Event thread, this includes handling things like mouse clicks and key presses. It also handles the drawing of components, like your `Snap` component. You might be seeing the problem here... If you tie up the event thread with an infinite loop and a sleep, thing like your mouse listener will never fire. Typically what you do is have a thread updating the game world and calling repaint on the main component at suitable times. [Here's](http://codepad.org/oEPL0p2S) an example I wrote up for another redditor. You shouldn't be overloading paint if you don't know exactly what you're doing, either. PaintComponent is a better choice. See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ku7n9/bouncing_balls_leaves_traces_of_themselves_in/c2n9544) for some links regarding custom painting in Swing.
i am trying to check if something is not in an array, but i cannot think of what to use
yeah, a while loop like that is probably the wrong idea inside of a paint method.. the idea with paint is that it gets called often (100s of times a second, maybe) to refresh the screen. It should have a more or less direct and deterministic (IE you can glance at the code and tell how long it's going to take to execute) path through the function. Things like your game state loop (IE do this sort of thing while it's running, another while it's paused, etc), should be placed somewhere else. Conditional drawing based on those loops should be done with if statements, not while loops, since you just want it to draw whatever it needs to for a given state, but not loop over and over. In general, anything that forces you to call repaint() from within the paint() method is very bad.
I played it for a bit and the only thing I didn't like was when I wasn't moving and I needed to quickly get away from a missile coming at me and I couldn't go fast enough. Other than that it's great :). 
[For-Each Loop](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html) is the equivalent of for x in y. int[] int_arr = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; for(int x : int_arr) { System.out.print(x); } The previous code will output: 0123456789
I'm using Swing. Since this is for a midterm assignment, I'd rather know exactly what I'm doing than just letting the IDE do it for me. I'll check out the pages you sent me. Thanks!
If you use an ArrayList there's an indexOf() method that you could check. Might be overkill for your situation. Adding a method to your class like this would work: private boolean elementFound(int value, int[] search) { for(int check : search) if(check == value) return true; return false; }
if you want to know if something is not in an array, you might be better off seeing if you can change your data structure from a simple array to a collection of some sort (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html); If you pick the right collection, like a hash set, you will be able to determine if something is in the collection much more quickly, (amortized O(1)). Currently, you are doing this is O(n). This might not be a big deal for a very small array, but if it's very large, it could make a huge difference in the amount of time it takes your program to run. Regardless, any object that extends collection will allow you to simply call object.contains(someOtherObject) and save you the trouble of the for loop.
would that there were police for such things.
That seems good, I am currently thinking of abandoning using arrays and use vectors for the contains()
VirtualStore? My understanding is that UAC is triggered whenever a program tries to do one of several things. One of which is writing to the two program files locations. And probably writing to certain parts of the registry, as well. But it sounds like you're right that it would probably fail. The OP should see this, for more info: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1076794/uac-and-java
Yeah, that makes sense. I can't even close the window when the loop is running. I'll try to play around with Timer to see how it works.
In particular, this can be used with anything `Iterable`.
`Vector`s are deprecated; don't use them! Use `ArrayList`s instead.
You almost wouldn't know that if you see how many people still use them in their code they post here. I never used vectors and thought I was missing out on something until I read it was deprecated.
I assume it's from tutorial code or a famous learn Java book that's still circulating. Or perhaps really poor lecturers/tutors who are still stuck in JDK 1.1.
Nothing worse than trying to compile something that worked perfectly on your own machine on a university machine only to have several errors due to an old JDK. Our machines still run 1.4 or earlier. It's not huge, but I use Scanner a lot for small projects and I have to change it all just to demo.
Sorry, but this code is wrong. base^0 != base You should've instantiated 'result' to the multiplicative identity and iterated through the loop one more time. *Edit:* Also, to OP: grandson39 is right that you shouldn't post homework here or to stackoverflow. But in the case that you have put forth an earnest effort and are stuck, it's okay to ask for help if you show us your effort. Or in other words, always post your code first to show that you've at least made an attempt to solve the problem. In that case, it's better for us to point out where the problem lies in your code, instead of just providing you with the answer.
I havn't tested it yet, but this sounds like what I have been waiting for !
Java got a for each loop some time in the last few years: &gt; int[] test = new int[]{1,4,5,7}; &gt;for (int intValue : test) { &gt; // do some work here on intValue &gt;}

If you have a set of elements and you want to check if it contains a specific element, you might want to use a [java.util.Set](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Set.html), probably [HashSet](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html), [TreeSet](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html), or [LinkedHashSet](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html). Looping over a collection to test for membership is inefficient. An implementation of List will loop, giving O(n) performance while a HashSet gives O(1) performance.
That does not compile.
Java Service Wrapper 
The correct format for a ternary operation is: (condition) ? (assignment if true) : (assignment if false) Just need to change what's inside the for loop braces to: return (check == value) ? true : false; 
I am not aware of any library that already does this. You might look into creating your own templating DSL, where reader and writer both use the same syntax definition. But I am not sure this would justify the work. If you can foresee that the amount of different file formats will change a lot in the future, do it. If not, well, implement reader/writer pairs for every format and **document them well**! Might clash with your demand for elegance, but this approach will save you a lot of time and headache.
I **think** [Antlr](http://www.antlr.org/) can do this. Maybe. I went through some of the tutorials to see what it was about and that's all I took away from it. Maybe somebody that uses Antlr can say "Nope".
Good catch, corrected it.
If you have control over the file format i would recommend you use a more structured format, possibly JSON, YAML, or XML.
I know they will change, but maybe not extremely. The two things I do know will happen is * I will not be the maintainer forever, and the next guy needs something easy to understand. * New formats will have to be implemented (either by me or the next guy) The amount of work I have to do now is secondary to ensuring it will be possible/easy for the next guy to update/maintain the code. But as you said, if I can't find another way I'll just document the crap out of it.
Looks promising, I'll dive into it. Thanks!
No problem. :)
I have no control over the file formats. The program I'm writing will take the output from one program and change it into a format one of our other programs can import. It's quite silly, but we use four different programs, all doing almost the same thing, but right now only two of them can talk together...
This sounds like a better fit for Perl than Java, in my opinion. But good luck!
Can you explain the problem to me? You want to use xml as a persistent data structure. Then convert the xml to java objects when your java db is loaded? if you use JAXB you can annotate your classes and then convert from XML to Java Objects really quickly. Just have a read up about [SAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML) and JAXB on wikipedia or something. This doesn't sound like an easy task since you'll also have to support querying on the data using an SQL like syntax so you'll need a parser to convert queries to java code. Man this is a large task that you are undertaking. Why not use one of the millions of already available DB's?
Thanks. Perl might be better, but it's only me here to do it, and I only know Java. If I had the time I could have taken this as an opportunity to learn Perl, but...
Antlr will do this, no problem, although I'd suggest it might be a little too powerful for the job. However if you want to give it a go I'm happy to answer any questions you might have along the way. I'm not expert but have used it enough to know the basics. Edit: thinking about it though, you are going to have to write a parser and a template (using StringTemplate) for writing so it might not solve your problem as well as you'd like.
The project involves basically duplicating an SQL database. The first part was creating a handler for commands. Creating a command prompt, deciding what the input was, if it was correct and what type of command it was. That part is done. We are now working on implementing the individual commands. This go around Define Table is what we are working on. We also need to, on start up, check for a .xml file and load it. If there isn't one, the program creates one, then writes (probably rewrites the way I think it too work) to it every time define table is called. The purpose of this project isn't to create a database (because yes, we would just use one of the millions already available). The point is to become very very familiar with OO design and using things like polymorphism and inheritance. 
Then in that case you can work with Java objects and use jaxb to save them and load them to file in XML. Just annotate your class variables with jaxb annotations. Good luck!
Yeah, I looked at the documentation, and I think that's what I came up with as well. It seems like a good tool for reading files, but I would still need to have something separate to write files. Though, I did not know about StringTemplate, so thank you very much for that!
Yeah written by the same guy and fairly neatly integrated into Antlr. Edit: FreeMarker is also a good template language and slightly less anal about MVC separation.
You might want to check out PilotFish (http://www.pilotfishtechnology.com/)
I also used Java Service Wrapper for a windows service. I looked at a fair few options but ended up sticking with the tanuki solution. With a bit of fiddling it worked perfectly! http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com
I don't recommend reading Oracle's documentation for that very reason. There are two good books I can recommend that you might prefer to read instead: Eckel's Learning to Think in Java 4th ed. This book covers JDK 5 (so it's not strictly up to date) but will give you the fundamental knowledge for object-oriented programming, syntax and design. Ivor Horton's Java 2 (latest edition) covers JDK 7, which is the most up to date. This book is much more exhaustive and later sections go in-depth in the Java Collections Framework and Swing and a few other things within the language.
Thanks, but I'd prefer not to shell out cash for something I may not end up even needing. I'll try out other methods of learning before I use any sort of money to learn. Hell, maybe I'll even learn trying.
That's fair, you can try checking a local library as well. I'd suggest searching Google then.
The platform JavaDoc are more of a reference, they're not very useful as a learning tool (as you've found out).
&gt;I'm finding the conventional documentation from oracle incredibly hard to get through. Not that it's complicated, it's just so dry. I tend to learn well through applying what I do Thank you, finally someone that understands this. I got fed up with that sort of thing in Java IRC channels.
An older version of TIJ is free: http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/ You should check that one out and if you like it, buy the newer one :)
There are at least 2 possibilities here. On UNIX systems, the line break is typically just a "Line Feed" character. On Windows systems it is "Carriage Return" AND "Line Feed". If you know that the txt file was created on the same platform as the one your program is running, you can find out the appropriate character(s) by calling System.getProperty("line.separator") and then use that with a replace method to change it to a space.
My psychic powers tell me that you're likely using BufferedReader.readLine() which corrupts the input by eating the newlines, which is exemplary of early retarded Java API design. 
Correct. However that's how I'm supposed to do it for this project. I ended up just using if (i = line.length() -1)
The workaround is to add your own newlines (and hope they match the original ones), but the real solution is of course not to use BufferedReader.readLine().
That sounds fine, and shouldn't be too much overhead.
Thanks!
For the OP, just in case: You can express a newline in java with "\n". So, "Hello\nWorld" represents the string "Hello", followed by a newline, followed by "World".
Actually, a newline in Java is *System.getProperty("line.separator")* like InfoSec812 said. (Which usually ends up being "\n" on a sane system, of course.)
I'd like that. I'm a bit more advanced than 101. But I was reluctant to post my question at all because I felt this was more of a java information area, not homework help. 
I was originally against the idea of further fragmenting /r/java, but after the start of this semester I'd have to agree with you. /r/javahomework might serve as a platform for new users to quickly browse and find similar issues. This might be a bit daunting right now when all things java are cobbled together. /r/java101 might be a good name, since that's what most of these questions are.
[/r/learnProgramming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)
The problem with /r/learnProgramming is that it is too generic. It's great to ask questions, but it's near impossible to browse and learn from. A common language subreddit lets users browse previous entries much easier. A newbie could learn from a wealth of common issues relating to their language of choice.
I like being able to ask questions here. It's not for my homework (in fact, I'm not not even taking classes anymore) but merely for personal interest. I have asked my question here precisely because it was specifically about Java implementation, but I think this addition would further fragment /java. If you're not interested in the learn-java type of posts, you don't have to read them.
no
can it just redirect to stackoverflow?
Do you think it will get used? Will the mods delete / move threads from here? The other half of the problem is that this subreddit gets next to no posts. If we had a stream of interesting news, then the question posts would be a lot less visible.
indeed, you've got this under control; nice to see!
Also, who will visit, and who will answer? When the newbies notice they get no response over there, won't they come back here?
You have less than 6000 readers; sorry but I think this is a terrible idea. Maybe the moderators can institute a tagging system: "[HOMEWORK] What's a null pointer?" 
Good catch! Sorry, wrote this code in a few seconds which goes to show the #1 reason why you should not post homework on the internet is because it may be wrong! So based on DustinEwan's comment this should work instead (I think!). public int calculatePow(int base, int exponent) { int result = 1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; exponent; i++) { result = result * base; } return result; } For extra credit mailboxy - solve this using a) recursion b) allowing for floats e.g. 1.5^2.3
Well, if it needs to be maintainable, then keeping it simple is the best thing. And what is more basic than a clean interface? Every Java developer will understand what is going on and how to use it immediately. If they are not that experienced they can use your implementations for the existing file formats as pointers on how to do it right. Another bonus is that you won't rely on some external library that might change quite drastically (especially if it is open source). 
Having used both Java (since 1.2) and perl (since 4.x), I would *strongly* advise you to use perl for the job (hell, any text-processing job); it's so much more efficient (on programmer time *and* execution time) that it's not even funny. You don't even need to use the trappings of high-brow programming. OTOH the architecture astronaut in me says to create a Domain model first, then generate interfaces for the file format facades, then create your facade factory; then you could use antlr or something like it to write your own little DSL, in which you can express the file formats used for both reading and writing... On the third hand, one language is no language; learn something else too.
I'm actually the opposite - If a var is used in just one place I usually inline it, unless the nesting level of expressions gets too deep. 
Note that you *will* have issues with the switch of contexts from characters to bytes, especially if you use anything buffered. HTTP does this and Tomcat had to write it's own implementation of header parsing because the default Java classes aren't very cooperative in this corner case.
Yeah, that bit me when I needed to inspect some classes while they were loaded, had to actually use a bytecode engineering library to read annotations without issues.
What about http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava No one uses it but we could start. I'm in a mixed boat, I don't mind answering peoples questions. The ones that annoy me are the sort that say I have to do X by tomorrow and I'm fucked! You can see they clearly don't understand what they are required to do and then just expect someone to do their homework for them. Normally leaving a question so vague it's not possible to answer.
Honestly this happens to every programming forum at the start of the academic year, personally I don't mind them. There are a few solutions: submit tutorials, down vote them all, make-up a tagging system or lave as is. I'm not for removing stuff mostly because I cant "remove" just spam content and that has side effects for Reddit as a hole. //spelling 
Not Bad, moving left and right seems a bit jerky but otherwise I really like it. 
This is a great idea!
&gt;after the start of this semester I'd have to agree with you One day last week (or maybe the week before), the top **six** posts were homework requests. Two were for the exact same assignment.
I like /r/java101, its less presumptuous about the questions.
I agree, I don't *mind* answering questions. However I've found that many of them are indeed worded so vaguely that at first they sound like an interesting question, but then I'm disappointed after clicking through. And yes, the desperate pleas for help are very annoying.
No doubt, but my main complaint is that I rarely see any useful news about java except 101 questions. So, another solution is to say something like "it seems like you're having trouble understanding the difference between static and instance methods. Look into that and post to /r/java101 if you need more help", as an example.
Can you expand on the 6000 readers part? I personally don't care about the size of the community or frequency of posts if they're *high quality* and not homework spam.
This was also on /r/programming but it seems to be impossible to have a conversation about Java over there at the moment. Anyway... It looks pretty nice to me. I'm not sure how well the extension method approach will work in practice - something I need to spend some time with. I've found similar approaches to occasionally cause build problems in the past - although nothing too serious. I'd also be interested in the performance characteristics - presumably they are good although it will be interesting to know if there are edge cases to be avoided. Not one to be using on Android though!
I'm new here, but it's written right there ---------&gt; It's pointless if when you remove the homework spam there's little left. At least we have something to talk about for now.
Yes. If we compare /r/java to /r/python or /r/ruby we can see the subjects are way more complex, and it presumes that you already have a working grasp on the language. Imho when you go to a subreddit for any technical subject, you are not going to learn, but to specialize, not to start learning about the subject. (specially when there are viable places where you can learn about java) A new subreddit where you can help beginners sounds like a great place. (and adding a links to places like javaranch or stackoverflow) 
/r/learnjava is a better name.
I think this is a fantastic idea. While i code, I would love for someone to look and say.. you should make this an abstract class because blah.. or don't initialize here... or stop doing redundant checks here.. use generics or reflection to reduce redundancy etc.. check at the top level... etc etc. I think key things i would contribute to this thought is that the programming tasks and puzzles aren't like week long coding projects? Secondarily, maybe we can also propose programming tasks with topics? for example.. how to really understand abstract classes vs interfaces etc.. when to use etc... i use etc a lot... anyhow great thought! I'd love this.
The tasks I was thinking of are short snippets of code, around 1hour - 30 mins. Something everyone can get involved with from beginners to professionals. Since there seems to be some interest maybe I'll start a new post with some programming tasks in it and we can take it from there. Any ideas for the the first task? I was thinking of just using the problem that I proposed above, the roman numerals problem and then we can do some more advanced tasks if people are interested. The beauty of this task is it works for all levels of experience and also something good to get people doing TDD (test driven development). 
thx for your help everyone!
Most of the programming homework questions we get are so basic that we could probably do them in another language. I think it would be best if we had a general programming homework subreddit instead of just a java one. Perhaps r/ProgrammingHomework? 
Honest question. Why would you want to do that? What scenario is that useful in?
Im totally down for this. Im super bored programming for my job that honestly I would like to work on a puzzle or task of some sort. I equate it to me playing starcraft; playing ladder is the main goal but sometimes i just to play vs. AI for the hells of it or else i get burnt out.
Count me in. 
If it's upvoted, and is about java, then it belongs here. You have one way to change that - downvote it.
Here's a pseudo-code solution: numeral := input number remainder := numeral roman := "" (empty string) ones := 0; fives := 0; tens := 0; fifities := 0; hundreds := 0; fivehundreds := 0; thousands := 0 while remainder &gt;= 1000 thousands := thousands + 1 append roman with "M" remainder := numeral - 1000 while remainder &gt;= 500 fivehundreds := fivehundreds + 1 append roman with "D" remainder := numeral - 500 while remainder &gt;= 100 hundreds := hundreds + 1 append roman with "C" remainder := numeral - 100 while remainder &gt;= 50 fifties := fifties + 1 append roman with "L" remainder := numeral - 50 while remainder &gt;= 10 tens := tens + 1 append roman with "X" remainder := numeral - 10 while remainder &gt;= 5 fives := fives + 1 append roman with "V" remainder := numeral - 5 while remainder &gt;= 1 ones := ones + 1 append roman with "I" remainder := numeral - 1 print(roman)
[Here is the code](http://pastebin.com/taa6UvnA) [Here is the code MKII + comments](http://pastebin.com/QsJuA7Wz) Thanks to pjaybell for refactor of StringBuffer to StringBuilder. [Here is my test class](http://pastebin.com/CczMRdx7) What do you think?
That's pretty much the solution but you have not done any Java so that defeats the point. The solution is not very difficult to achieve but to code it elegantly is. I know it's an easy task but it covers some good topics like testing and data structures. Practice makes perfect. Also you haven't covered all the cases. If I wrote a test I wouldn't get IX for 9.
Really like the use of enums in your solution. Only things I'd pick up if I were code reviewing it was to use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer and have some more comments just to help someone reading it, especially since these puzzles will be a massive help for newbies. Great stuff, could really see this helping the /r/Java community!
I did play around with some data structures. SortedMap and TreeMap but they don't sort on the order they are added to the Map. The other alternative was to write a comparator but that seemed overkill. Oh and thanks, let's hope these take off and we can do some more. You should of had a go yourself first ;)
Some people really really like Tomcat. At my last job, I was told to use it as an app server for something that served no requests. Just create an init servlet and kick off Spring from there. This was not my preferred architecture.
normally I would have but on my tablet watching the Scotland - Spain match!
Well I'm only here because bf3 beta is over lol.
Does it have to be done in Java? This is the exact kind of problem awk was designed to solve and it can do so in one or two trivial lines of script. Any awk site will have an example that you can trivially adapt to this, if you don't want to spend the 20 minutes looking at awk syntax to work it out. If it has to be Java, then obviously awk won't work. Alas, the only Java-based awk implementation I know of looks like an abandoned project.
http://pastebin.com/RDKeDpzA
Ah I forgot about that quirk of Roman numerals. ;) Good catch. I was just writing it quickly while at work and plan to implement in Java later.
Took me a while to follow the getRomanNumeral method and understand what it was actually doing. You could make this static String[][] romanChars = { {"I", "V", "X"}, {"X", "L", "C"}, {"C", "D", "M"}, {"M", "?", "?"} }; And this could be in a method call initialiseValues(placeIdx) String one = romanChars[placeIdx][0]; String five = romanChars[placeIdx][1]; String ten = romanChars[placeIdx][2]; Otherwise it works well. I like the fact that you are not defing all the edge cases which is what I've done (4, 9, 40 etc..) 
I'm definitely on bored, now you can all laugh at my coding stile. 
You're right, the post seems to have been hijacked by .net-only people. They don't realize that some people like more than 1 language :) Anyway, back to your thoughts, the extension methods approach works quite well in practice. Very few issues on my end and I'm using them quite heavily. The @Function stuff is still beta but works alright for the most part. Performance-wise, these things work great, again, in my experience.
Precomputed all numeral lookups in class initializer Added comments http://pastebin.com/80riszxk
Wow, that subtraction thing makes whole thing allot cleaner than what I thought it would take. I had in my mind that you'd have to mask of the 1's place, the 10's place, the 100's place, and the 1000's place then handle each one separately. This is much simpler.
Can you please tell me the purpose of the " - '0'" within the switch on your original code and in the look up on your new code? I am assuming it converts a char to a int or something like this? Also your output variable is unused within your interactive method.
Yes, it converts from the character '0' to the integer 0. It does this using the fact that a java **char** is really a 16 bit integer. The character '0' is ASCII code 48, 1 is 49, 2 is 50, etc. Writing *value - '0'* is essentially a shorthand for *(int) value - 48*. Write a program that assigns the character '0' to an int (*int testInt = '0'*), then print the value of that int. Ooops on the unused output variable, missed that while refactoring.
Thanks, never thought about doing this in such away, I guess I have never come across a need to convert a char to an int representation (until now!). 
Hmm... Seems like it's just for XML?
It doesn't *have* to be Java, but Java's the only language I know, and I'm not a programmer, so I don't trust myself to learn a new language in a short enough time.
Nice solution with enum. I was thinking the problem through and would have tried Arrays like bananaseepeep's solution, but I like th enum better. (except your edge cases IV, IX, etc.)
This is the site my college's programming team is using to train with: http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&amp;Itemid=8 It has literally hundreds of programming puzzles, and for every one of them they will run your code through automatic test cases. [Guidelines for getting your code to run](http://acm.uva.es/board/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=7429) [A really easy problem to test the automatic grader](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&amp;Itemid=8&amp;category=94&amp;page=show_problem&amp;problem=1012) I think what you're proposing is cool, and there is a *lot* of value in collaborative problem solving and just being in a programming community. I just thought this would be a nice link for people who are interested in this stuff :).
It's not the worst way in the world to achieve that. Definitely not the best, but I'd prefer it to, say, rolling your own.
I don't think the number of readers has much bearing. Nobody is preventing anyone from subscribing to both subreddits. Why is /r/java pointless without homework spam? Java is one of the most used programming languages in the world and a lot of things are happening in the Java community. Perhaps all the Java pros and people willing to join interesting discussions have already left because of the terrible signal-to-noise ratio here?
Although I like this a bit less than separate reddits, I do think an enforced tagging protocol would be a huge help. For reference, here are some of the vaguely worded submissions on the front page right now that would really benefit from a [HOMEWORK]. * [What to do about long lines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l5t4w/what_to_do_about_long_lines/) * [Streams and char data type](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l5hi3/streams_and_char_data_type/) * [in for java? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l6mcs/in_for_java/)

Am I missing something here? Tomcat is an application server/container. Spring is an application framework
Messaging integration with systems that don't have any messaging capability other than email? I know I have seen some older systems that use email as event loggers. Might be useful to collect them, parse and enter in some other system like a service desk - though most of the commercial ones already have email connectors inbuilt
Can you monitor the incoming TCP stream, determine bits per sec, and drop the socket if it falls below a defined threshold?
2nd the tanuki, JPPF implements this as a service wrapper as well.
We were writing an app that was made up of a couple of services that spoke to other nodes over a message bus which handled comms and sessions etc. I felt an OSGi container would have been more appropriate.
If all you are doing is sending 3xx responses, can you stick a reverse proxy in front of your server to buffer the requests? http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule will dispatch a complete request at a time to your app and nginx is meant to scale well to many requests. This is not a solution in your code as you asked for, but should solve the problem and mean you can keep your app focussed on the task of redirecting.
Frankly, the best way to do this is to use software that has already solved this problem! As din-9 has suggested, I think nginx will work nicely for your needs. If you decide you want to solve this problem on your own, then these "nefarious clients" will eventually figure out some other way to tie up your resources, and will keep doing it until you go insane. Just let someone else handle all the work.
You just indirectly solved a problem for me. Thanks din-9!
You may be right, I guess the only way to know is by trying. But the amount of java pros (who dislike homework questions) is naturally smaller than the amount of students who need homework help (and those social misfits could have simply downvoted these posts if they ever were a majority). Maybe you should create /r/truejava instead or something. Personally I think if we don't stick around those poor students won't have anyone to help them with their homework ;) As long as the posts are tagged, if I'm free I don't mind helping.
I have been needing something like this many times. This time a customer wanted to send emails to a DB. I normally would be using subetha stmp server, but then I have 2 independent processes and I need to duplicate jars ( not code though ), startup scripts for both, (tomcat and subetha), updates for both...it's just a hassle. Also it was a challenge and I learned very much about the inner workings of Tomcat 7. I later learned that the google app engine has something very similar: http://www.vogella.de/articles/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html#email
this :-)
Create a new Thread per accept and close the socket after 2 seconds. No normal client needs more time than that. (This will throw an exception.) If you don't want a second Thread you could write a server using NIO. But that is more work. I would try the second Thread approach.
This is a route we had considered, but the response is geo-location enabled; so the origin IP will affect the response.
Normally, I would agree with you. I dislike re-inventing the wheel. With this application, I have to customize the response depending on the source IP using our IP-&gt;Location library on the back end. So a caching reverse proxy would not allow for that sort of customization as far as I know.
I'm concerned about the amount of overhead this could introduce.. Perhaps I will think about a cached thread pool with a timeout. Creating new threads is a relatively expensive process, and I want this to be a very high-performance application. Currently, our benchmarks show it answering on the order of 600+ requests/second.
I'm not sure I know how I would accomplish that in Java.
Seems you can forward the original IP address http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,449,454 If you are writing the back end, then pick it up from the suggested X-Real-IP header.
Then send on the IP as an X-IP header or similar.
Did you look into (Apache James)[http://james.apache.org/]?
Subclass InputStream, keep track of the number of bytes via the read methods.
There is an O'Reilly book out there called "Java Distributed Computer" which has a good example of how to track bandwidth per stream. It's only a few classes and you would just wrap the streams with the new bandwidth tracking stream. Maybe have a central thread that checks each stream once a second and kills suspect connections. I found a link to the source code: http://jcs.mobile-utopia.com/jcs/s/package%3Adcj.util.Bandwidth It appears you can find the section here, though it is hosted via FTP and I was unable to find a http link with a few quick searches: ftp://docenti.ing.units.it/arc_stud/Mumolo/JAVAdistributed/ch08_04.htm 
I like it, not done any Scala as of yet but I like the recursive solution. Nice and concise, although if I was to suggest anything it would be that you could use better variable names. 
I've checked out DeliveryNinja's example &amp; learned a thing or two from it. Now I've tried to make a "deromanizer". It works for all the non-quirky numbers, but not the edge cases. Anyone care to comment or give me a hint as to how I should tackle those particular problems? [Deromanizer](http://pastebin.com/xFW4EQLy) *EDIT*: using the javascript from the kata I can see a possible solution, but it doesn't really look nice.
I haven't got time to go through it properly but my first thought's on deromanizing edge cases are to check if you have a lower number on the left of a higher number. For Example IX is 9 is it possible 'I' would be on the left of X in any other situation? So you may want to grab a number and check what is to it's right hand side. Got to get on with my day job. ;) I'll be on in about 4 - 5 hours and give the deromanizing solution a go.
Ye, should've waited with posting. Been thinking about it and have some ideas how I could solve it. Thanks for your effort. Got it [Deromanizer II](http://pastebin.com/L6fz0Cz5). [Test Cases](http://pastebin.com/0AvEF2Cc)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For would be the de-facto standard for this.
This is the easiest way to go about it.
Years ago I thought so too, then a good consultant asked me to write a loop in Java and create a million new Threads. Try it, time it, you will be amazed.
THanks for the clarification. Makes sense now. ;)
I don't get it.
My humble contribution: (http://pastebin.com/siDFrzzy)
Here is my attempt. Was more difficult than I originally thought. Definitely some refactoring is required but it's a start. [Deromanizer](http://pastebin.com/F9PEbbAZ) I was reading through your solution. I avoided using chars purposely because you can't compare to string. Its a good solution just refractor it. Break out some of those if statements to method calls etc.. good job. 
Well, the stated purpose of the class is fine - I got tired of handling attachments in mail too many times. Though the top section of the class makes no sense. In fact, since some methods simply return List, using those would lead to unpleasant warnings and, quite possibly, unpleasant bugs in production.
Why do you need a _caching_ reverse proxy? Caching is hard to set up anyway. Just follow the documentation on nginx.org and you can have nginx forward you the original client's IP in X-Forwarded-For or something.
Consider this: public List getTo() throws Exception { javax.mail.Address[] recipients = this.mimeMessage.getRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO); return recipients != null ? Arrays.asList(recipients) : new ArrayList(); } What's the value of the method? Would not you rather use the javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage methods directly in your code?
Hmmm . . . That's a good thought... Disable caching and just use nginx to filter out the crap requests....
Yes, I love it and Mailets rock, but again, I don't always want to duplicate jars and startup scripts and update effort. Sometimes I just want to service an SMTP call in Tomcat where all of my code already is...
runescape has a client. That client talks the "runescape protocol" to the server. A bot can use the same protocol to talk to the server and pretend to be a legit client. It will try to mimic all the shortcomings of a user, slow mouse, unpredictable key presses, etc. to avoid detection. It therefor takes a lot of effort/money to detect a good written bot. It's a cat and mouse game just like viruses...
Thank you that was very informative. I'm glad to hear that Jagex is being honest about it being a difficult problem.
The great thing is that commons mail seems to start to go in the other direction as well. They have been great in the create mime direction. But they had nothing on the parse front. Until now. And the getAttachments method. :-)
show me getAttachments...
just had a quick read through: * when concatenating strings, always use a StringBuilder, especially in loops like in your example * needs more comments. I would like to see what you are trying to do in the comments before you actually do the code for it. Well commented code is a must in any team environment. * I'd have a look at DeliveryNinja's example for the test cases. I like the way you've got round the problem that 4 = IV not IIII though. 
i promise to have a go tomorrow night. If i fail to do so, feel free to hound me!
I'm up for helping out. This is an excellent idea as I've found out first hand how code reviews can really improve the quality of the code you produce both as the reviewer and the person being reviewed. 
Like paranoidray said, as soon as JaGEx comes up with a new way to stop bots, the bot makers will find a new way to bot again. It's very difficult to completely stop it.
One of the ways that Jagex tried to stop bots were through random events, but even those didn't help in the end.
I know nothing of this, but I'm curious how one codes a bot for random events?
There were a limited number of random events. The randomness was if/when it would happen and which one it was. Other than that, once you found out that you were in a random event and which one it was, then you could just use pre-defined routines for said event.
Well the events weren't completely random. There was a large library of puzzles with different possible answers. There was tons of variations in the puzzles but of course there wasn't an infinite number. So eventually the bot programmers managed to write code for every variation that might arise.
Someone (Witold Bolt) just submitted a patch to support Mac OS. As part of that patch I removed the AMD device restriction. As the docs says this was just caution based on minimizing test matrix. If you build from source Aparapi should now work with any OpenCL 1.1 runtime. I hope to create a new binary build shortly for linux/windows/mac 64 +32 soon. 
What line is the classcast exception coming from? My guess: theData = (T[]) new Object[capacity]; I think you may be running into the problem of java generics not being reified.
That is the line that the exception is being thrown on. I have no idea what you mean by your final statement. 
Just a reminder (to all) to watch out for `check == value` versus `check.equals(value)`. `check == value` is fine for primitives such as `int`s, but you usually want `check.equals(value)` for objects. 
Java is complaining. It's saying: You say new Object[] is an array of type T. But obviously it's not! So. Let's jump to your next question: So how do I create an array of type T? Short answer: you can't. You'd think the following would work; theData = new T[]; But this will throw errors. Why? Well, it has to do with how Java's generics aren't as powerful as they could be. Ask your teacher about it. My suggestion, use a regular object array and just cast on the way out.
If that were true then why would my book give me an example which is literally my code? I just feel like there must be a way to make this work since everything else is saying this is how it should be done. 
I figured out why I was getting that error. I had previously tried to define T in order to accomplish something else, and I didn't think about the relation I had just ruined. Thank you for the help and sorry about the confusion.
I made it really quick, just for fun * Usually I use SB to concatenate Strings * I'm sorry for the lack of comments, I just had no time * I hope some day I could do real TDD. The project in which I'm involved is a very large one, with zero tests. When you change something, you never know what are you breaking
I myself have been disappointed with the lack of useful methods around threads. Granted, I don't write a lot of threaded stuff, but there's one project I am on right now where I have a daemon-like program that launches 1 or more threads. I haven't had the need for what Thread.interrupt() claims to do. I did try it out just to see what would happen. It didn't do what I thought it might do. 
Here's a Stanford course that uses Java... http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111
The JVM itself and many middleware frameworks use interrupts all the time. Its use in applications is probably less common in comparison to specific exceptions created by the programmer. I would disagree with your initial premise that Thread.interrupt() is stupid. Besides the ways the JVM uses it under the covers to handle thread scheduling tasks (remember that a JVM has to emulate/translate features that may not exist on the platform you use Java on) there are many other things interrupts can do that you aren't giving credit for. ([For reference, the spec.](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupt%28%29)) Threads can be interrupted if they are waiting on a lock/monitor; sleeping; joined on another thread; blocked in I/O; waiting on a Selector. Then, for other cases you can still interrupt a thread, but instead of generating an exception you change a field which can be queried. In pretty much every case where InterruptedExceptions can occur, they should be handled by checking the applications state and reissuing the original call if desired. This is immensely useful if you want to wake something up in a way stronger than a notify() or in a place where no other method exists to do so. (It should be noted that the API spec actually tells you to use this loop design in most of these methods. wait and sleep especially. For example, consider using one of the NIO Channel interfaces like SocketChannel. You can be actively reading data and some other part of your application needs to interrupt that thread. This is useful to impose arbitrary timeouts or to change the state of the application and get your "reader thread" to do something different. If you didn't design it this way, you'd have to wake up the reader thread on a regular basis, or set a static socket timeout and reconnect each time in between checking your application's state. That would be inefficient all around. In your infinite loop case, your code can check the thread's interrupted status with Thread.interrupted() and take appropriate action without needing the InterruptedException or a specific interruptable action. In this scenario the interrupted status works as if it were a Thread-level "state-field" you query for your own application's purposes. It is the obligation of the developer to build this kind of logic in, of course... and it may be that the interrupted state isn't the best way for your application.
If you think there's a lack of useful methods around threads, you need to read [Java Concurrency in Practice](http://jcip.net/). 1.5 added some really neat thread frameworks.

As with all computing, there must be at least a certain measure of trust. If you don't trust the client you don't accept it's input. Therefore you create rules for determining who to trust. People who make bots therefore aim to follow these rules. Every time a new rule is created the people with bots program it to follow this. They want to stay trusted enough to avoid becoming untrusted. 01: Game developers add new rule to stay/become trusted 02: Bot developers reverse engineer the rule and program it into new iterations 03: GOTO 01
Oops. Your 40 and 400 values in SPQR.ROMANS are incorrect. This gets me thinking that, by having so many constants in your class (the static final array of arrays), many test cases are necessary. 
There are also the [official Java tutorials](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html).
And I've been lookin for a while on google but i've never worked with images before.
I find that in practice none of this actually applies. Fore example... I could be calling code in a library which won't cooperate with interrupted() Also.. what if you're in a regular expression? Are you supposed to check interrupted constantly in the regex code? The same things could be accomplished by making InterruptedException a RuntimeException. 
I find it funny that Netty has fooUninterrupibly methods ... ... typing all that extra doesn't' really make it too much more convenient. 
Indent your code with at least four spaces to format it properly.
Could you use an android device to run a server but I'm not sure how you'll be able to get any output to the monitor from it without paying for a decent phone with TV out.

I prefer JDOM over DOM. It's much more intuitive to use for me. I haven't used SAX before though.
If I understand the question correctly you need to run with the Guice context. I've not used Jersey or Guice but it sounds similar to running with spring injection. If you don't you won't get the inject, should be as simple as adding @RunWith(GuiceJUnitRunner.class) to the top of the test class and then adding your config with @GuiceModules({ ComponentsTestModule.class,ServicesTestModule.class }) See this [link](http://fabiostrozzi.eu/2011/03/27/junit-tests-easy-guice/)

I'd have to say that comments in code are not required, although for this exercise I've added comments to my own code to help beginners. The key to good software craftsmanship is that you write self documenting code using the variable names and method names as the documentation. There are corner cases where comments may be required but I'd say try and use them as sparingly as possible. If it's not obvious then you have room to refactor the code. for( int i = 0 ; i &lt; Long(100) ; i++){ bp = bp + 1; } for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_TEMPERATURE; i++){ boilingPoint = boilingPoint + 1; } Here the top implementation requires comments while the bottom doesn't. ( I know it's a bad example! :P )
Rename drawSprite to be an override of paintComponent, like this: protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) ... Instead of calling drawSprite() directly invoke it's repaint() method. This is because it's a JFrame. If you want to have multiple things drawing on the same JFrame then keep your drawSprite() as it is, but put the paintComponet() logic in another JFrame and make `EnemyGhost` no longer extend JFrame.
What you're wanting is something that simply can't be done safely with native threading, for the [same reasons the depreciated Thread.stop() is unsafe](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#stop(\)). Java doesn't provide a way to do it because using it in your program would make your program fundamentally unstable. 
One of the best things I did in undergrad was to make apps that did useful things for myself. For instance, for a statistics class I wrote a small app that transformed a plaintext dataset into something I could import directly on my calculator. It saved me and a few of my friends from a lot of manual entry.
I'm in a similar boat, I prefer picking a project and pushing through it to learn. Of course, that could also account for the number of unfinished projects in my repository.... If you're like me, video tutorials are also helpful, in which case I'd recommend looking at uReddit ([class link](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/iagkl/class_introduction_to_java_a_video_guided_tutorial/)). The main problem with relying on a library to learn a language, is there are "enhancements" or abstractions the library put in place. If you get used to the way a specific library does things, you'll run into trouble when you try to move to a different one.
I don't see anything wrong with the code on first glance - Is there something funny about the image? What happens if you convert it to a png or a jpg or something, is it still invisible? I was thinking perhaps there is a wonky alpha channel or funny color scheme - sRGB or something that is throwing java's drawImage method off.
Yes, don't write your own bean bindings unless you are just trying to learn.
seems rather biased to me, thought some java redditors could help even the scale.
It looks like you want your daily pay to increase exponentially (day x should be double day x-1), but in your loop you're having it increase linearly (day x is 2 * x).
That's supposed to happen. The daily exponential (EDIT: \doubling/) increase in yields give you an exponential growth in total earnings. Am I assuming right that the commented output is "supposed-to-be" output? EDIT II: Oh, I see what's happening. Am I right in assuming your raw output ends up being: 1 1 2 2 3 4 ... There's the fudgy input-altering way (pad with 0.s and such dynamically), and the nice and neat way that requires you to read a little deeper into http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html. 
All you said was 'my foor loop isnt working'. Under 'Pennies for Pay Calculator - Version 3.2', is that what a properly executed program would output? Don't use int for currency either.. use a double/BigDecimal or something else Edit: as a complete side note, why do you have those while loops sequentially like that? If you want to have it quit based on a certain case, you might want it to be more like: ----------------------------------------- ask about the # of days once here while(days!=0){ if(days &lt; 0){ error message here } else { run the loop } ask for the # of days again } //since days = 0, now that you are out of the loop, post your exit message or whatever and close gracefully
in the same boat. programming is rough i spend at least 20 week on that class.
haha, agreed. it is very biased in Perl's favor. I code both Perl and Java on a daily basis, and I like both languages for different reasons. The funny thing is, there aren't a lot of young kids now adays that are excited about perl. Most of the focus is on other JVM languages, Ruby, Python, etc. Perl seems to be dieing.
the problem im having has to do with the equation/ assignment that would output the desired numbers. total += i * 2; does not double the pennies each day. i don't understand the "running total" concept. and thanks. ill change the total to a double and fix the syntax of the while statements when and if i get the for loop taken care of. 
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with you there, you should be doing both. When I'm reading over someone else's code I want to see what they were trying to do, then I can check the actual code which is made easy by the use of suitable variable and method names. Additionally, if you look at a piece of code written over a year ago, the comments help you gain the understanding of what you were trying to achieve at the time. 
I have a similar problem with some of the legacy code I have to work with. There is a lack of testing, even now I have the coverage up to 30% any major changes are painful to do. I can never have confidence that I'm not breaking something. It is a hard job to try and turn the test coverage around because it will require a lot of time and it's classed as "Not essential". If your feeling brave read this [Working with legacy code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052), I've still not got round to looking at it but it's been recommended. Might give you a good idea of how to start getting your coverage up.
So you really just one while loop : Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print("\nPlease enter the number of days. (Enter zero to end) "); while ((days = console.nextInt()) != 0) { } In this while loop, you will need to evaluate if the number is positive or negative. if (days &lt; 0) { System.out.println("****Invalid value****"); } else { in the else clause (positive value has been input) do your for loop. You need 2 variables though : 1) the daily amount 2) the running total for (int i = 1; i &lt;= days; i++) { float dailyAmount = (float) (Math.pow(2, i-1)/100f); total += dailyAmount; System.out.format(i + ") $%.2f%n", dailyAmount); } System.out.format("Total $%.2f%n", total); Please make note, 1 is for calculating the daily total which appears to me to be a power of 2. (2 to the power of (day -1)) This is done with the Math class. Then re-ask the user input question in a System.out.println and close your while loop. Outside the while loop, put your "Thank you for using" code and you are done. 
you are going to want to reset the total each time you ask for how many days the user worked.. total=0; also, the total pay is 2^n -1 where n is days, so you could just calculate it once. and for a single days pay, you can calculate it by 2^n-1. your program is going to print the running total and not the value for each day, so if you have 3 days it will print: 1 (tab)(tab) 2 2 (tab)(tab) 6 3 (tab)(tab) 12 you have a 2 instead of 1 for your first value, because 1 * 2 is 2.. and then you saved that to total. then the second iteration will be 2 * 2 which is 4, added to the 2 you already have saved in total for 6... and for the third you will do 2 * 3 which is 6, added to the 6 you already have for 12. 
I liked the jokes - never heard them before. Except for that, it is so biased, nobody would take it seriously. "If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution." That can make a great conversation starter.

I don't at my current position and I'm a full time regular employee (at a very small company) Any change in the economy and by-by job. On the plus side: -Generally, you can negotiate a higher salary being a contract employee since you don't get the internal employee benefits. Case in point, I'm leaving a $40k salary for a $65k salary with no changes in benefits because I'm moving from a small business to a large corp. My wife works at a hospital so our health benefits are extraordinary anyways. -Also, the hiring agency seems more like a personal career advocate... It's in their best interest to keep you employed since they make money off of you being there. So you can expect to find a job if your contract doesn't get renewed. (At least that's what they told me when I asked a similar question). To summarize: Ask lots of questions with the hiring agency!!! Tough ones!!! Don't oversell yourself, but don't undersell yourself. If you say 55K, and it's a steal for them, you'll get 55K and won't know you would have gotten 65K, had you asked! 
... browser screwed up posted twice
I've had a go, but the solution isn't a million miles from your second version so I vote that one as the best solution. Next time I'll make sure I'll submit first.
Its expected the solutions would be similar. If you want to start a new one be my guest. Maybe we could try something slightly more involved.
I'll have a think over the weekend and see what I can come up with. Maybe should do a few more about this level and see how it goes before doing something too intensive. 
Why do you care?
Groovy,scala, clojure, JRuby, fantom, gosu. By end 2011, they say: Kotlin and ceylon
C.
I'm on the same boat. Going back to C was actually fun. Python is also fun.
If you can get hold of this book at a library, I recommend reading "Core Java Volume II Advanced features" by Cay S Horstmann &amp; Gary Cornell ISBN-13: 978-0-13-235479-0. It has a nice section on XML in there.
You could try some .NET!!! only joking ;) I'm currently trying to learn some clojure as it's a different paradigm. Scala seems to be the language that's gaining the most traction at the moment. Especially in the banking sector. In my personal opinion Scala seems to try to do too much and because it allows for traditional oo and doesn't force you to be funtional so I'd probably fall back on old techniques. That's why I've gone for Clojure. There is always C,C++,Python,Ruby,Haskell,Assembly,JS,Groovy ... You could always try to do some things with concurrent systems in Java with [Akka](http://akka.io/). It's what I'm looking at currently. Or if you haven't played around with spring integration and messaging that is also a good way to go. You said you were doing web ui then there was a great of example of real time updates using XNPP on the BBC radio 1 website, check the blog [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2009/11/pushfeeds.shtml) 
Python. It's fun!
Python. Python is the salve to the hurt that is java.
Same here - 15 years java, dabbled in lots of other things, now poking around with Objective-C and Cocoa. 
Python, Android.
Scala
Haskell or Perl, to go in two different directions.
Explore something that occupies a different space in the abstraction spectrum and is used for different tasks. Scheme, Lisp, Clojure, Haskell for functional; C, C++, Go for systems level; perl, python, ruby for scripting. I personally like to have one language of each type that I'm good at so I have the option to choose the appropriate tool for the task.
If you want to keep doing web stuff, I'm in a similar camp (Spring, JSF, JEE background) and have been pretty happy playing with Node.js+CoffeeScript in the past few months. It is new and edgy, but still pretty easy to get started on, and it may or may not be a marketable skill at some point. 
i have been trying to learn some C, but I have had trouble getting into it. can you point me in the direction of some good resources for getting started... i have ANSI C, but i am looking for things to practice coding online with more instant feedback. let me know what you think 
I second this. Find a different environment for your new language. e.g. you mostly write enterprise Java apps? Learn a small web scripting language for pumping out quick sites. Or learn a low-level language and write some drivers/kernel patches.
I'll second Objective-C as a fun language to play with after Java. I've been working with Java since it was Oak ('95) and continue to work with it daily. Last year, I started developing some iPhone apps to go along with our Java-based software. It's been a lot of fun, challenging due its different take on OO development, and definitely different.
Why not .NET? (I'm serious). Ok, it's Windows-only, but it's fast, features quite a good GUI with WPF, an ORM withEntity Framework, is web ready and Visual Studio is a great IDE. 
I "care" because I was looking for fodder for an argument of Perl vs Java. I have perl programming coworkers and I like to start some flame wars with them occassionally.
I learned perl via the llama book back in the day, but I've come to realize how different it is from other languages. Switching back and forth between java and perl is difficult for me. 
Scala! Do you like what Martin Odersky did with generics? It gets better. Here's an example of why I like Scala so much better than Java. I was writing a simple method today with Guava to convert a list of domain objects to a list of their associated ids. Let's assume I have a class DomainObject with getters/setters for id. In Java, if I want to convert a list of one to another (as simple as I know with Guava's Function and Collections2): List&lt;Integer&gt; domainObjectIds = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(Collections2.transform(new Function&lt;DomainObject, Integer&gt;() { @Override public Integer apply(DomainObject domainObject) { return domainObject.getId(); } }, domainObjects)); Now, the same code in Scala: domainObjectIds = domainObjects.map(_.getId()) I mean, I know it's an isolated use case... and I know that it's a weird functional example, blah blah blah... but it was just one of the many times I've bumped up against the limitations of Java and found that Scala has a succinct, simple solution.
I really like Python, but the 2/3 community split is a bit annoying. Also, if you're coming from a Java stack and you're used to package management tools like ivy/maven, getting used to virtualenv feels like a really broken solution. That said, I really love how Python's dicts are very similar to JSON objects. Marshaling back and forth between the two is super simple, and Django is a great web framework.
If you want to use try alternative JVM languages, Scala and Groovy (and Clojure if you like LISP-like langs). Otherwise Ruby for something that's become popular. Or Haskell if you like to learn something just for fun.
For a refreshing terseness, try golang, you big son of a bitch.
need more specific details about how you are trying to launch and what error messages you are seeing. Also, may I recommend that you use StackOverflow instead (it has nice formatting for code blocks). But if you don't want to post there, just put the info into a comment on this post and someone will help.
Thanks for the reply! I don't know how much detail to provide, which is why I was kind of vague. Here's the full error when running the example program (which is called CreateAndUseFTPHost): Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/vendorname/software/external/SoftwareLogListener Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.vendorname.software.external.SoftwareLogListener at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:307) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:248) Could not find the main class: CreateAndUseFTPHost. Program will exit.
The problem is that the class or jar in question is not being included in the classpath when the application or application server jvm is launched.. Compiling is not the whole issue. The classes are not technically loaded into the JVM until they actually are needed, and thus rely on the classpath to load certain classes on the fly. There are references to other classes in each class, but those pieces are not loaded until they are about to be called. With c++ and other languages, the libraries/classes are compiled into the application code, and when running the application, the entire executable is loaded into memory with all its relevant pieces. Java is not quite like this, in the sense that not all components of the application are loaded right away, so references to classes not yet used need to be interrogated by following the classpath directives when the application is run. Eclipse and other IDE's certainly paper over this idea. I suspect the issue is the thing compiles just fine, but when you run it, you are presented with the classnotfoundexception error, which is a result of the JVM not being able to pre-emptively load the class following the classpath directives you are giving it when running it in standalone mode outside the IDE. One way of getting around this using eclipse or any other IDE is to export the whole project to one jar. the jar then contains all the elements needed to quell classpath errors when the JVM is invoked on that jar. This will obviously not work with a web application, however, though WARing up the project is kind of a similar idea in some respect. if the application is meant to be run just by invoking the jvm and is not a web application, then jar-ing the project will likely solve the runtime issues. With all that said, there may be some minor issues with what i have said prior to this, but i believe most of it to be accurate, at a high level. 
Thanks! I'll keep tinkering with the class path and see what I could be doing wrong. I've gone so far as to put my .class file on the server in the same directory with the .jar files it uses, but I'm still getting the same error. I think I may get some sleep to get some fresh eyes on this in the morning.
as a long time Java EE person, diving into Jruby on Rails was a breath of fresh air for me. I would recommend Jruby on Rails. 
Thanks. Will have a look. 
just do total *= 2 for each additional day; you don't want to multiply i by 2 but rather double total. That simple change should fix this.
C++11. Nice syntax good perfirmance
Hey, I'm also learning C as well. I have spent the last 4 years with Java and wanted something more lower level. I picked up a copy of [C Programming A Modern Approach](http://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318573435&amp;sr=1-1) and have been completing one chapter a night. And by one chapter a night, I mean reading the chapter, taking notes on stuff that I don't get, and doing **all** of the programming projects. Even the early chapters that are super easy, I figure that it will help me learn the syntax so that I'm not screwed later. If you have the time to learn slowly like me, I really suggest it. As for practicing C online, as far as I know, that is impossible. C is way too destructive to allow people to compile and run it on some server.
You can't just put the class file in the same directory; the class file needs to be under a folder hierarchy that reflects its package hierarchy. Also, you since you keep bringing the word "server" up, should clarify whether you're developing a standalone Java desktop app, or a J2EE webapp, or working with servlets, or what, 'cause it's a different deployment strategy for each case.

If you find that Java "hurts" and Python doesn't, you're probably just predisposed to liking Python over Java. These are properties of you, not of the languages themselves.
&gt; Don't use int for currency either.. use a double/BigDecimal or something else If you use double for currency, a lot of people are going to criticize you for being a noob and say you should have used int instead. One reason being that double suffers from rounding error.
Even if there are an infinite number of variations, if all the variations follow the same format, you can program a bot to solve all of them. For example, if you have an infinite number of puzzles: "What is 2 + 7?", "What is 2+8?", "What is 2 + 9?", etc., but they are all additions, you could program a bot that could handle any addition problem, even though there are an infinite number of them.
If you care about typing as little as possible, then Java is probably not the right language for you.
It depends on whether your primary goal is to get the job done (i.e. you're undertaking work for a client for money) or to learn. If it's getting the job done, and if you're at the point where you're not sure how to make "all the files be able to see each other", I'd recommend forgetting about writing an XML parser for now, and just embed your static data in an class with static fields, e.g. public class MyConstants { public final static int NUMBER_OF_CATS = 3; public final static String NAME_OF_DOG = "Wolfie"; } If your goal is to learn, then again, forget about XML alltogether until you know the answer to "once this file compiles, how do I actually use it". You should be able to write, compile and execute a Hello World program before worrying about the XML aspects of this problem.
I believe [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2910115/include-external-jar-when-running-java-jar) is what you're looking for. Just include the 3rd party jar file and run it. For real production use, learn [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html) . It's basically like C++'s make tool. In there, you can specify your dependencies etc and you can use it to create executable jar files too. Good luck!
I know how to write Hello World. I just wrote a character class for video game simulator I'm doing with a friend. I just have no idea how this SAX, DOM, JAXB stuff is supposed to work. Like I have no idea how to find out if I have the libraries they use in their examples, or where to get them if I don't have them. And where to put them after I get them. Then the thing is, they have this class, but then they have this main doing the work inside the class which isn't something I've seen before. I'm used to having some myprogram.java file that executes the main thread using classes and methods etc that are defined elsewhere. I'm just looking for a good way to store a lot of base values (they are actually "Level 1 stats" for a character in a game) so that they can be used later on. It seemed like an XML file, and the accompanying parser, would be a good way to do this.
&gt; Then the thing is, they have this class, but then they have this main doing the work inside the class which isn't something I've seen before. I'm used to having some myprogram.java file that executes the main thread using classes and methods etc that are defined elsewhere. Sorry, I don't really understand the distinction you're trying to emphasize between the first sentence and the second sentence. Do you know how to write a program composed of two classes?
Actually, my post regarding Streams and char data type wasn't for a homework assignment, im just new to java :(
Apologies. Upon reading it you definitely don't fall in the annoying category; you've clearly done some research trying to understand your problem, and are asking about one of the trickier parts of Java. Its just the vague title that makes it seem like a desperate homework question.
Internally, Strings are _always_ encoded with UTF-16. When creating a string from a byte[], you get to specify the encoding it should used, as explained by @kreiger. I would avoid asCharBuffer. Specify that all character data to and from your server must be UTF-8 and extract the byte[] you need from the ByteBuffer, and create strings from that.
Yes.
Do you know how to write a program where the two classes are in different packages?
I have never used packages before. Don't you just import both packages and then everything else is the same from there?
Usually, you don't import packages, but rather classes in the package. I'd recommend learning about packages then; then learn to make JARs, and then learn how to invoke the code in the JARs you just wrote. You should probably learn to write interfaces somewhere along the way if you haven't already. To get to this point, you're looking at about a month of study. Next, you'll probably want to really master trees as a data structure, and there's a chance you might be able to figure out DOM from that alone, though the chances are slim, 'cause XML is actually quite a complex standard, and it's not the "tree" part that's difficult, but all the minor details (e.g. when is white space significant, how namespaces work, etc.) Failing that, you should learn about regular expressions, context free grammars, EBNF, parsers, etc., which is about 6 months of full time study, or like 2 years of "goofing around" study. That should prepare you to understand SAX.
Interfaces are one of those things that I don't really get. I mean I read up on what they are, but I still don't understand what exactly they are and what the point of them is. I understand how trees work as a data structure and how to traverse them. I understand regular expressions as well. The other stuff you mentioned not so much, I have no idea what context free grammars or EBNF are. I've also not done anything with JARs before. At this point it seems like I should just use a text file and read through it to get the data I want lol.
you need to learn what the fuck Eclipse is doing for you so you know how to configure it. Write and compile a java program using Notepad or Vi the compile it using javac. This is really basic shit.
I highly suspect you are transporting around this "CreateAndUseFTPHost.class" file and SoftwareLogListener.class file right? You can't just move a class file by itself because it is part of a java package. If your classes are loose in the filesystem, they need to be contained in a series of folders and subfolders that reflect the package. Notice what the JVM is telling you in the message. It isn't looking for a Class Def. of "ClassName" it is looking for "com/something/something/ClassName". You need to make sure that your folder setup is correct, and that your classpath is pointing to the top of that folder hierarchy... because the JVM will go looking for that full path each time. Try looking at the structure of your jarfiles for an example. You point the classpath to a jarfile by-name. But if that jarfile was exploded out into the filesystem, you would still only point the classpath to the head directory... not each of the various class directories.
&gt; At this point it seems like I should just use a text file and read through it to get the data I want Yes, that's probably simpler, assuming you already know how to do that.
I do. I was thinking along the lines of "If I'm going to do this I'm going to do it right." And I just read that XML was the way to do this. I don't really understand the difference, to be honest, considering they are both just files of text that you are reading from.
This is more of a math question, not java. Without giving away the homework answer, isolate X on the left side of the equation, then you have your answer.
XML imposes a lot of structure upon the data, which makes some things easier (like complex processing and transformation of the data), but other things harder (like reading or writing the data). If you have all the background knowledge (the 2 years worth of knowledge I summarized earlier), then using XML is not much harder than doing it with a text file, but gives you a lot of benefit (which you might end up never using for your game). But if you don't have that background knowledge, it's easier just to use text files. I've been working with XML and related technologies (XSLT, XPath, XQuery, etc.) for maybe 3 years now, and I've still got a lot to learn.
Ho would I do it with java?
I see. Well let me just express my gratitude and say thank you for the time you've taken to answer my questions. You have been quite patient with me and I appreciate you taking time out to help me understand this, particularly this last bit.
I found it in the Google collections library and love it since.

You don't need to type the &lt;generic&gt; a second time...
Why they couldn't have used this inference to let the compiler need the type declaration on the right of the expression I don't know...
If you are using java 7 this isn't a problem anymore.
ok, but I'm trying to understand the first &lt;T&gt; on the newArrayList method. what does that do, how does that work?
This is necessary when the class declaring the method isn't itself generic for &lt;T&gt;. It's basically declaring the method as generic, rather than the class.
oooh. now it makes sense. java generics sometimes confuses me a a lot.
Read about generics.
What's the state of this? It looks like this is from 2008. I can't find a plugin anywhere, although I did find some source here: http://code.google.com/p/cola-rtse/
This one specifically. 
Great post, but it's no longer relevant with JDK 7
I'm not sure how Oracle's changes will effect your serialization method but if it did, you could always stick with the same version you are currently using. There is a really good Google solution for serialization called [protocol buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/). I think this will be your best bet when trying to serialize your objects as XML can be slow depending on the size, it's quite heavyweight. 
proper remote peer coding! 
You know, I should rig up something like this for arrays. If I type final List&lt;Element&gt;[] listArray=new List[10]; Eclipse gives me a warning about unchecked casts, but if I type final List&lt;Element&gt;[] listArray=new List&lt;Element&gt;[10]; I get a syntax error telling me I can't create a generic array. There's no way to win (without an @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")). Until today...
That is quite impressive!
I haven't looked at java 7 yet, how does it solve this problem?
 final List&lt;Element&gt;[] listArray = (List&lt;Element&gt;[])(new Object[10]); I don't have Eclipse handy, but wouldn't something like that work?
This was nothing special, just two guys typing in the same editor. I didn't see menus being open, classes created in parallel etc. Why did they leave that HashSet erroneously? There's no way none of them noticed it for so long. I expected one of them to go there and press Ctrl+Space to auto-import the class, but obviously this is not possible. What would be cool was that they can create classes in parallel, so one guy writes Set&lt;Orc&gt; orc; and proceeds to write the getter/setter, while the other guy creates the Orc class and writes it, and then the red underline disappears under the Set&lt;Orc&gt; for the first guy. I would imagine that the when the other guy opens a menu, it doesn't show on the first guy's screen. Also, if the other guy opens another class for editing, it's not shown for the first guy unless he explicitly opens that file, in which case he can see the editing live. It's a cool idea, but at this point it's nothing special.
technologically this seems very cool. But in terms of usefulness I don't see it as useful. If youre working on the same line or lines right around eachother then you'll end up stepping all over eachother and typing over eachother. If you give eachother sapce then one person might be working on a function he wants to execute and test but the other person insn't ready yet etc etc.
That would be damned nice for interviewing programmers.
I couldn't find it anywhere else. I did find something using the same concept called [Saros](http://www.saros-project.org/).
List&lt;Element&gt; elements = new List&lt;Element&gt;(); Is really that annoying? Considering any decent IDE auto-completes as soon as you type "new". Adding language short cuts only undermines the language where the surrounding eco-system of tools is better suited to addressing the concern. 
It's still relevant to people that still have to code in Java 6 or earlier, i.e. pretty much every professional Java coder.

The new syntax allows you to do the following: HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); Empty diamonds for everyone!
Try Lists.newArrayList(), Sets.newHashSet(), Maps.newHashMap(). Or even, ImmutableList.of(a, b, c), ImmutableMap, etc.

Maybe I'm not following.. java.util.List is an interface, you shouldn't be able to instantiate it as you're describing.
In Java 5 and 6 you can use this, instead of rolling your own: http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5,0/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptyList%28%29

You'll be fine. Anything that's marked Serializable will have stable serialization support for all future versions. 
This looks great. Thanks for open sourcing it!
That doesn't work. You can't add to the list created by emptyList(). It returns an unmodifiable singleton shared instance
Arrays and collections were not meant to play nicely with each other. I think you're better off with List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;. It's too much of a pain otherwise
That returns the same List object every time. Also, the object is immutable; you can't add anything to it. Returning the emptyList object is an alternative to returning null. 
There's an excellent chapter in *Effective Java* about generics. There's also the [generics tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html) and [another generics tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/index.html). 
Post the problem and what you have written and we can take a look. 
Or for remotely explaining / working through code. Apart from that though, it seems a bit pointless.
ok I'm a little nervous to post the part of the question online so I'm going to explain it: I'm trying to see whether an ISBN number is valid or not. They want the user to enter a String which corresponds to the ISBN. From there the program is supposed to check every character in the string, make sure that it is a digit from 0-9, and then put it into an array. Also there's a little trick, the last character can either be a digit from 0 - 9 or an 'X'. (This is the first part)
my code so far is this: public static boolean validateISBN(){ Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in); String checkIsbn; int []ISBN = new int [10]; int index; int lastNum; int lastX; int n; int s; int sum = 0; System.out.println("Please enter the 10 characters of the ISBN"); checkIsbn = keyboard.nextLine(); System.out.println(""); for (index = 0; index &lt;= 9; index++){ int num = (checkIsbn.charAt(index) - '0'); if ((num &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (num &lt;= 9)){ ISBN [index] = num; } else{ System.out.println("The ISBN you have entered is invalid"); return false; } } lastNum = (checkIsbn.charAt(9) - '0'); lastX = (checkIsbn.charAt(9) - 'X'); if (((lastNum &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (lastNum &lt;= 9)) || (lastX == 0)){ ISBN[index] = lastNum; } else { return false; }
I know that the last little part isn't right, and just altogether whenever I try to run it, no matter what i put as my ISBN it says I have an OutOfBoundException. 
lemme know what you think! i appreciate it in advance!
The reason why you're getting an OutOfBoundException is because the final value of the index when your for loop terminates is 10, so when you call ISBN[index] = lastNum; you're passing it an index of 10 when the last index is 9.
so do i make it &lt; 9 rather than &lt;=9? thats really the only way I can think of fixing it..
As the description says, it's checking to see if a string matches "not [something]". If it doesn't match that pattern, it prepends the string with "not ". The conditional you noted in your post is checking to ensure the string is longer than or equal to 3 characters, then checking to see if the first 3 characters are "not". If both of those conditions are met with truthy values, it assumes the string is already prepended with the word "not". I'm no Java expert, but it seems like you could omit the length check and just perform the `substring` operation since it implies the string is at least 3 characters. Maybe Java's `String#substring` method throws an exception if you ask for more characters than the String has.
Well the error occurs when you're trying to write the last character. So you could just use 9 as the index. if (((lastNum &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (lastNum &lt;= 9)) || (lastX == 0)){ ISBN[9] = lastNum; } else { return false; }
ok ya that helped, but because i have two variables there what if they put an X, I'm not sure how to make it either lastX or lastNum depending on which they write
The length was confusing the bawlls out of me. I think you are right sir, thanks! I will try that right now ;D
You could modify your last "if, else" to be an "if, else if, else" and assign based on that.
thanks, you've really helped me out!
No problem... just pay it forward.
You don't want to have a bunch of strings in an array. What you want to do is create Item objects (I guess an Item parent object with DefenceItem and AttackItem children), store the defence and attack and name in those, override toString() to get the "Diamond bladed sword which gives + 15 attack" output, then have a static array of these objects inside the Item object and have a static method that gets one at random using the Math.random method (google it). Unfortunately I'm guessing that you're pretty new to Java - I'd seriously recommend looking into some Object-Oriented concepts before embarking on trying to do something this complex.
Except for Swing objects which they specifically say are not guaranteed to be stable in future versions.
Visual studio is a decent debugger. But as an IDE it is atrocious. Where is the builtin support for: vcs, build systems, code introspection, refactoring, change management? Its hardly an *integrated* development environment. Don't want to start a flame war but it always baffles me when people suggest that its good. Perhaps i am missing something?
If you want something *different* try erlang. It will have you scratching your head for a long time. 
I cant see ur code but do u know what static means? This would be ur best bet, u may need to instantiate the class
&gt; Maybe Java's String#substring method throws an exception if you ask for more characters than the String has. It does - &gt; [IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the beginIndex is negative, or endIndex is larger than the length of this String object, or beginIndex is larger than endIndex.](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#substring%28int%29)
Clarification, because the title can be misleading: I am not associated with Aparapi in any way. I just stumbled upon it and thought it was something r/java would enjoy. 
substr throws exceptions if you ask for something not there - you could use the String.startsWith instead if (str.startsWith("not")) return str; 
Did anyone else have problems with the sound? For me it was distorted and full of "blips".
Trying to use a string for such will get messy very fast - you really need to turn list into an object - something like public class DropItem { private String desc; private int noAttackes; private int noDefends; public DropItem(String desc, int noAttackes, int noDefends){ this.desc = desc; this.noAttackes = noAttackes; this.noDefends = noDefends; } public String getDesc() { String result = desc; if (noAttackes &gt; 0) desc = desc + String.format(" gives %d attacks", noAttackes); if (noDefends &gt; 0) desc = desc + String.format(" gives %d defence", noDefends); return result; } public int getNoAttackes() { return noAttackes; } public int getNoDefends() { return noDefends; } } If the list of items is going to be short and the number of times the most likely item is less than the least likely isn't too great - then you can do something like public DropItem[] buildArrayForDrops(){ DropItem[] result = new DropItem[100]; DropItem item1 = new DropItem("Wooden Spear", 3, 0); result[0] = item1; result[1] = item1; DropItem item2 = new DropItem("Wooden Shield", 0, 2); result[2] = item2; return result; } then use random to select from the array which one to pick - the shield should come out half as many times as the spear. This way could get complex quickly - it can be easier with collections and generics private void addToAvailableDropList(List&lt;DropItem&gt; list, DropItem item, int likelyhoodMultiplier){ for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; likelyhoodMultiplier; idx++){ list.add(item); } } public List&lt;DropItem&gt; buildListForDrops(){ List&lt;DropItem&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;DropItem&gt;(); addToAvailableDropList(result, new DropItem("Wooden Spear", 1, 0), 2); addToAvailableDropList(result, new DropItem("Wooden Shield", 1, 0), 1); return result; } though I'd start re-thinking if you have more than a few hundred entries in the list
[Better use the Random-Class instead of Math.random. ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/738629/math-random-versus-random-nextintint) It will also result in nicer code, since you can directly get an int instead of bothering to cast and round the result.
Good find. This is the kind of stuff I'd like to see more of on /r/java.
Yes, I just looked it up, getClass isn't static. So, use the classname .class directly.
Why not use a regular expression?
Ah jeez, I really appreciate your time and help, but I am having trouble implementing this code into my current code, I am a rather large noob but i am really eager to learn. Im think whether I should pause this project for now and work on some other things, or if i should just keep going with this. Do you guys know of any modules that i can do, i found that it is the best way for me to learn.
It really is annoying when you post code examples that won't even compile, mr. Java expert.
Well in that case... thanks for posting this! ;)
I will try ;D Because that's so much more intuitive, ty!!
what I would do is backup the source code (by zipping the directories/project) which would leave me free to experiment without risk of loosing what I have. you might want to take a little detour and read up on Source Control Repositories - e.g. [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)/ [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - which, as long as you check in regularly, makes reverting back easier 
well i've had a little experience but i mean very little. I'm not new to coding as i've done VB and python and a smidgen of C#. At least its not impossible :D i do have a good portion of a year to do these applets in
You can't instantiate an array of a generic type. It has to do with the fact that the type information of a generic is erased at runtime, but the type information in an array is not. See Effective Java for a more thorough explanation.
Making everything static isn't a solution ...
With Scala: val elements = List()
Subtracting chars is such a bad practice ... it is just wrong. What forces you not to use `Character.isDigit`? EDIT: How are you actually supposed to store the X into a number?
what is Character.isDigit? never heard of it.. 
It tells you whether your char is a number?
I think that homework questions are the biggest problem right now. Java is a very common beginning language for many schools, so many people will come here for help. Help is not a bad thing, but many of the questions that I am seeing could be solved by taking some time away from reddit for half an hour and thinking about the soloution instead of running to reddit as your first resource. I know you say "well I've thought of it for a while" but you need to think about it more. The teacher/instructor is not giving you the problem because it is going over things that you haven't learned and they like to fuck with you. It's main purpose is to test you and to challenge you into becoming a better programmer.
sorry I'm a real beginner with this stuff! does it tell you which number it is?
Why do you need that?
I think that you might be right, that some of the homework questions are people being lazy. These ones also tend to be extremely vague. Don't get me wrong though I welcome people asking questions as long as they are not of the form, do my homework. Sometimes people need some guidance. Maybe we need tighter rules on question submissions. 
Cheers for taking the time. If you were to create a homework subreddit, I think it would be more effective to advertise it with a banner at the top like in r/gaming rather than a sidebar link. It would be interesting to know how many (if any) are on r/java and not r/programming to see if it is worth cross posting Java stories from there. Discussion here would avoid much of the usual flamebait posted whenever Java gets mentioned.
Honest question here: do we actually want technical questions of *any* kind posted here? Stackoverflow is fantastic for technical issues, so shouldn't this be more of a **community** with links about the state of the art, discussions, promoting interesting projects and uses of java? 
I like the questions, I have had problems that I have been working on for days that just by reeding the comments I have solved.
oh because afterwards I need to get the numbers from the array and calculate things. They call it checksums or something or other 
You mean the thing I fixed like two seconds after I posted it? 
You can't instantiate an interface.
&gt;Is really that annoying? Considering any decent IDE auto-completes as soon as you type "new". If you're typing it repeatedly, yes it is annoying. Plus it is redundant, I shouldn't need to declare the type of a generic collection twice.
`if (Character.isDigit(isbnChar)) Integer.parseInt(""+isbnChar)`
I don't see any problem x-posting the links from r/programming if they are Java related. As for the homework questions I think we need to understand what peoples opions are. It seems some people want to have a level of question answering and others want no questions at all. It seems clear that we need to differentiate questions, whether it be via flair or by creating another sub reddit I'm not sure yet.
Who says it's the List interface? Perhaps it's a class of my own devising. The code compiles just fine as follows: public class List&lt;Type&gt; { } public class Element { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;Element&gt; elements = new List&lt;Element&gt;(); } } My example was just a code fragment. The fact is that I've spent a great deal of time using C# lately. C# calls Vectors "List". But way to detract from my argument with a largely superfluous point. So, are you done with your ad hominem attack and address my points? 
I'm typing a total of two characters after the "new"? In what way is that inconvenient? You're not always instantiating the variable at the time you declare it. It's nice to have the full type definition of your variable. I don't find it annoying. I find it a great additional reminder. The OP example basically further obfuscates code for a rather subjective opinion that it's "annoying". In short. It's just lazy. 
&gt;Internally, Strings are always encoded with UTF-16. UCS-2
Currently my opinion is post whatever you want in here, as long as it is java related, we have hardly any subscribers as it is and more posts don't hurt.
Please, no homework questions, we are not helping anyone only feeding our own egos by answering them. I am fine with reviews of homework solutions, but all out "how do I" type questions should go to a subreddit r/futureSoftwareDevelopersThatIwillNotHire
http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
This is something I agree with. 
This is good to hear. We are only serializing collections and primitives, as well as an ArrayList wrapper we wrote that is completely finished and will never be altered by us again. Thank you for the info
&gt; we are not helping anyone only feeding our own egos by answering them. There are different kinds of answers to these questions. I agree that what you say is true for giving a solution. But we can instead point somebody in the right direction e.g. [my answer here](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/ksov5/how_does_systemoutformat_work/), or explain where the error in their thinking is, which is more helpful in the long term to the poster. If we actually implemented a rule banning complete answers, it might even discourage people who don't put any effort in posting here as they won't see other people's homework getting done for free.
For the moment I am not sure where I stand on the questions. They do seem to be seasonal and will die down over the academic year. How about creating and enforcing standards on the questions asked? Delete any posts that e.g. don't include the author's attempt to solve a problem or don't ask specific questions rather than just going "heeeelllllllp meeeeeeeeeeee".

Swing runs in it's own thread. You can use atomic classes or sephamores to do this.
I think homework is fine as long as it is identified as such.
careful this will also match for Nottingham or similar the original solution also does that but the original definition of the behavior doesn't really implies it. 
I concur.
I know Swing runs in its own thread. The rest of my program runs in that thread too. But somehow Swing can still process events in its own thread even when one of my action events is stuck inside a JFileChooser showOpenDialog() for example. How does it do this? I want to do the same thing for my own version of a ProgressMonitor. I don't want to make the program's data thread safe - this isn't the problem and it wouldn't make sense to do it. The problem is that I would have to use 2 threads and effectively block the EDT from doing anything with the interface that could affect data but updating a progress window until a manipulation completes, then unfreeze everything so the user can use the program again. That is to say, it makes no sense for the user to touch something while a manipulation is in progress. If I've got multiple views into the data, I have to deal with all of them. I'd rather just do this how JFileChooser or JOptionPane do it - it seems cleaner, but I realize they're not doing exactly the same thing because their window is gone by the time it returns to the caller, and for my purpose I want it to stay there between calls. 
&gt; The rest of my program runs in that thread too. What exactly are you doing to achieve this?
Nothing special, everything is event driven from the UI - so when the user clicks "load file", its code runs in the EDT. The problem is this blocks UI event processing until it finishes.
The obvious answer is to not have swing manage your business logic. If you want to know explicitly what it is doing, check the src.zip in your jdk path. src.zip\javax\swing\JFileChooser.java Note this extend JComponent, so you will need a copy of that and everything else it extend up until you reach object.

Basically this whole program is a glorified version of mspaint that handles images with extremely large height (say typical 4800*80000) at one bit per pixel by breaking them into chunks of horizontal strips that are small enough to manage in an immutable sort of way and stored in RAM run-length encoded. It makes perfect sense for everything to be synchronized to the EDT because anything that modifies the image data could leave things in an inconsistent state during the process, especially if the treemap that stores the chunks of image is being reorganized. If I would go to having a second thread purely manage the image data, then everything that touches the data will need to do it through that thread (or risk synchronization problems if that thread is already doing something), and I think it's going to make this program twice as complicated as it needs to be. I'd rather just get rid of progress displays entirely and make the user wait without a time estimate.
Update: found some stuff here: http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net/docs/worker.php I'll take a closer look at this - they're mentioning the exact sort of problem I'm hitting - we'll see if they solve it in a way that works for me!
The only thing missing from this is the friends/partner cursor location so you don't type where your friends types and i'm sure that can be easy implemented.
What are you using for your GUI? I have something just like this using eclipse rcp and I could (but don't) contribute things like this via extension points, so the app would always know what's available.
according to [this](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) if you're using the defaults it's splitting by whitespace so the problem might be that your token is "1," not "1"
great post. we use a similar approach for bug handling, but the tips and tricks at the bottom had some good points/issues that I hadn't considered.
sorry, that's my bad, I actually changed the delimiter to commas and optional whitespace, I'll edit that now. Edit: The reason I changed it to commas and whitespace is because one of the string I need to read in has spaces in it (the string is 'The Frost Archer').
So the text never has commas in it?
Why don't you show us where you are stuck on your solution?
Can you put up the sample data that you have, just stick it to pastebin and I'll have a look. If you remove the else statement and you are looping on while(s.hasNext()) then you will hit something that is not an int and it will just loop forever as it's not moving on to the next(); position in the scanner. So if you want to have the loop without the else statement then while(s.hasNextInt()) needs to be at the top. I would just just try to debug it by doing the most simple things first. s.useDelimiter(","); while(s.hasNext()){ System.out.println(s.next()); } See what you get from that, start with the simplest solution and slowly work your way up. Try the same loop and print the Integers see what happens. 
He's stuck asking people to do his homework.
I'll do that when I get home from work.
correct, the commas are only for separation
Have you initialized your arrays to a size big enough to hold all the data you will be capturing? This is possibly why you're getting the out of bounds error. Also I'm not sure what you're trying to do with that delimeter (",\s*"). I used ", " I made those two changes to you're program and it worked for me. 
Yes, the arrays are large enough. Perhaps I was a bit vague with the out of bounds error. I set the stringArray to a size of two, and the int array to a size of 12. As you can see, there are only two strings, and a few ints. I was getting the out of bounds error because the ints were being placed into the string array. I will certainly try using ", " as a delimiter instead of what I have currently when I get home. However, I still don't understand why my delimiter wouldn't work.
Ah, I think I see you're problem. There are two useDelimeter methods in the Scanner class (which I assume you are using) which take different arguments. One takes a Pattern object argument and the other takes a String argument. It looks to me like you're trying to pass a regex string, but using the regular string argument instead of making a Pattern object and passing that. Hope that makes sense. Have a read through the [Pattern class](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5,0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) and the two [use delimeter methods](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5,0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#useDelimiter(java.util.regex.Pattern)).
Ahhh, I didn't know there were two methods, I also just assumed it would take a regular expression. That was foolish of me. What you say makes sense, thank you. And yes, I am using the Scanner class, I should have included that in the original post.
at this point you should be considering a CSV file and a CSV parser, imagine what would happen when you encounter some data that has commas, just like the data that had spaces...
With Java pre-generics: List elements = new ArrayList(); A bit more typing (pun intended), but nothing like the amount of cruft we have to go through now.
The difference is that Scala knows what's stored inside.
Wait... author says we don't need closures, shows us the abomination that is anonymous inner classes, and then shows some lisp/scheme for how it could be done properly -- sort of like closures and the concept of functions as first-class data type? This guy needs to learn what closures and functional programming are before trying to rally for/against it. 
The title was clearly sarcastic, based on the tone of the article. He clearly does not find anonymous inner classes to be a good solution. When demonstrating the Clojure equivalent, he comments: &gt; In a sane language, it could look like: [snip example] All semantics. Little ceremony, almost no syntax. He finishes up the article commenting on how you would be too busy weeping after a day of writing the Java samples to sleep. Doesn't seem like he particularly likes the Java approach. 
Well, writing swing code has never been fun. But that is not the way you do it. This poor guy should be told about SwingWorker.
Yeah im stuck, and im not asking for anybody todo it, just a little advice on how to get my head around the problem. and who said im a guy?
 JButton btn = new JButton("Open file..."); btn.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){ JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser(); if(chooser.showOpenDialog(SwingUtilities.getRoot(null)) == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION){ classLevelFileObject = chooser.getSelectedFile(); } } });
Also, it's not "codes", programmers don't write "codes", we write *code*. You might ask for a *code* example, but never codes.
Here are the pages from the [Java Tutorials](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) that might help as well. I see that Neres28 posted code already. * [File Choosers](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html) * [ActionListener](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html)
I'm so sick of people sitting around and arguing about their favorite programming language / platform / framework / etc. If you don't like java, don't use java for your work. This all boils down to my new slogan: Shut the fuck up and make something!
I hope this doesn't come off as mean, but remember, google is your friend. Most answers to easy (and often complex as well) java questions can be found very quickly this way.
ahh.. my sarcasm detector must have been off.. would make a lot more sense :)
The method names in main() need to match the method names in your Hero class. For example, you're using HitUp() when the method prototype is Hit(). They should both be "HitUp" or both be "Hit"... no mixing and matching. :)
Did you even attempt to do a simple google search first?
Oh, I thought "up" was just "understood" by java... Sweet that was it! Thank you!
Yes, but the problem I kept hitting was that the examples I found all used BufferedReader in order to read a file line by line and then they matched an entire line, but I am only trying to match the first element of a line and I am using Scanner.
...moderately off-topic, but just an additional recommendation: in java, the naming standard is for classes to start with an upper-case character, but variables and methods start with a lower-case. It makes no difference to the compiler, but other coders will appreciate the adherence to convention. :)
Abit offtopic as well, but you can replace Mana = Mana + increment; with Mana += increment; 
I know of SwingWorker. As far as I know, it has little to do with those examples. Case 1 is updating Swing from main thread (the opposite of executing a lengthy task from EDT). Case 2 is executing a lengthy task from EDT, but using data obtained in EDT (reversed order / dependency compared to the regular SwingWorker). SwingWorker helps. But compared to higher order functions this is a poor joke.
Part of the making (or doing) is learning, thinking, sharing and changing. "Shut the fuck up and work" is for slaves. :-)
It sounds as though the socket isn't being flushed. Perhaps you could post some code?
I sent you a private message, don't want to put code all over the internet.
Thank you for any help you will be able to give.
Could the terminal be blocked waiting for user input? Is multithreading acceptable in your schoolwork?
Case 1 is a school book example of when to use a SwingWorker. The Downloader class should extend SwingWorker and instead of progress.downloadedBytes(n) you would call publish(n). Much neater. But I will concede the second case, a SwingWorker wouldn't help much there. 
Re case 1: I do want main thread to wait until the task finishes. Yeah, I could still let the new background thread of SwingWorker do the job, and wait for results with get(). But that requires me to spawn an extra thread, tell my main thread to wait for it (does that feel right?), and add a whole lot of boilerplate required by SwingWorker and execptions from get(). That's the point: It all requires way too much ceremony.
If it's just one problem, perhaps you could use something a bit lower level and implement your own distribution solution on top of it. (Just an idea, since I don't know of any premade framework you can use. Maybe someone else will.)
We've certainly thought about it but the idea of designing something like that with very little distributed computing experience between us seems a little foolhardy. It'd also be nice for it to be fairly generic since we have similar problems in the pipeline.
But as long as you're only slave to your own ambition, you should be good to go 
Have you looked into Hadoop Map/Reduce? It takes almost all of the burden of distributed development off of you. 
We have. Perhaps my understanding is wrong, but it seems a bit much for our needs. It also seems to be rather tightly coupled to the HDFS and we don't have control over the workstations themselves. Additionally there's not a lot of data, just a lot of permutations, making the tasks pretty compute bound.
There is a framework called [Akka](http://akka.io/) which is a concurrency framework but it will let you have threads on seperate nodes which could be just what you're looking for. I might be wrong but it seems like a simple solution. I've not used it for anything at work yet just had a little look at it at home so I can't guarantee it is what you want but definitely worth a look. edit: I was thinking you could use message queing and just have workers which pick up the messages. This way if you need to repurpose a workstation it won't matter, another worker will take the message off the queue. Then just have a results queue, so you would have one central application putting messages on a queue and reading results from another while all the workers are taking off messages to do chunks of work. It's so easy to setup with Spring integration you could have this working in a day (optimistic estimation) 
why not just do if("not".equals(str)){ return str; } This way your not doing startWith("not") and matching on "nottingham" etc.. also it makes the code tidier and more readable. 
There are netCDF files, which have a really good java API. (Probably pretty similar to the NASA CDF format). I'm not sure about the lines, but this would definitely handle the rest. You might have to get a little creative to get the lines in there. Also, I have started working with ArcGIS and they take in OGC compliant files (or so I have heard) so they might be a pretty big standard. I haven't done anything with them yet, so you're on your own here. There is the Google earth KML file, which might work too. 
I am already diving deep into the NetCDF litterature and the ASTM standards E1947 and E1948. I haven't heard about the other formats so maybe I should read about them too, thanks.
Just as an FYI, this is really a mongoDB question and not a java question. You may get some help, but will likely have better luck asking in a mongoDB-centric location.
Hazzlecast has a number of distributed Collections, and it takes about 2 minutes to get up and running. Distributed HashMaps, locks etc. [http://www.hazelcast.com/](http://www.hazelcast.com/)
That code doesn't work though. For example, "not bad" would not satisfy that condition, and would continue into the function. The problem definition is ambiguous. In one sentence they say "not " (with a space after "not") and in another sentence they say "not" (without the space). In my opinion, the cleanest code would be: if (str.startsWith("not ")) { return str; } return "not " + str; Or, if you are a [ternary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation) coder: return str.startsWith("not ") ? str : "not " + str; The ambiguous case is the input string "not". Is the desired behavior to return "not" or "not not"? The specification is unclear.
I've messed around extensively with JPPF. It is easy to implement, pretty fast, and very customizable. Only downside (for me) is that it requires calls that FreeBSD (OpenJDK) doesnt support...so you cant use FreeBSD for nodes. I've also used Hadoop, hazelcast, and plain ol rmi...Hadoop would be my 2nd recommendation...but deployment is a bit of a pain, and managing workloads across multiple machines could be easier.
I won't tell you exactly how, as that defeats the purpose of the exercise, but I'll give you a big hint. You'll want to write a couple methods to tell you the number of days in a given month or year. Then you can write a loop to count the days exactly. Oh and maybe chuck in a quick check to make sure that your two dates aren't identical. I hope this was _sorta_ clear and helpful.
I would recommend Hazelcast as well. It's great and can solve your problem no problem if you have something of type Map&lt;? extends UnitOfWork&gt; you can have { 0 ... N } workstations join and start to pull work, or batches of work out there. Pay attention to synchronization and maybe keeping track of number of workstations so you don't read one at a time, but can pull an intelligent amount of work before pushing it back up to whoever is aggregating the result. 
I don't see any problem with homework questions so long as the person is showing effort in the solution and they're asking for advice on a small aspect. You could put some rules together for [Help] posts: Link your program to pastebin Provide the compiler output (it must cleanly compile) I'd also like to see something like [Discuss] where you can have a discussion about a language feature, library, framework, anything really. 
I agree with lurch00. JPPF doesn't look too difficult to me and it seems to be robust enough for the problem stated in the OP. Sometimes "overkill" is OK because it will position your team to address future project requirements that have not made themselves known yet.
Generally speaking, my advice is to write it out in English (or whatever your native language is) on paper first, then rewrite your native language into [pseudo-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), and then start coding in Java. It's best to think about it a few times before you start typing. Some things to keep in mind: The dates could be in the same year; There could be one or more leap years involved; The earlier date could be listed second. I would approach it by first simplifying, then counting. 1: Translate the start date from something like "march 8 1997" into something like "day 66 of 1997" 2: Do the same for the end date. 3: How many days are there from the start date to the last day of the start date's year? 4: How many days are there from the first day of the end date's year to the end date? 5: How many days are there in the whole years in between the end of the start year and the start of the end year? That's just one approach. Now that I've typed it out, I have a cleaner idea, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[Apache River](http://river.apache.org/) (formally Jini). Once you get it setup the API is straightforward and makes it easy to focus on your problem.
I don't want to sound like a jerk, but maybe your puzzlement is more with calendars than with programming and Java. Do you know how many days are in each calendar month during normal years and leap years? Do you know how to determine which years are leap years? Can you figure out how many days are between a given date and Jan 1 of the same year by using just paper, pencil, and calculator? Can you figure out how many days are between two dates just using paper, pencil, and calculator? 
Close but not exactly. While dividing the year by four applies to most years, it does not apply to the centennial, unless the year is divisible by 400. It's curious, tho, that his assignment tells him not to use the Gregorian date method, which is what this is. Anyway, to the OP, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the stock Date object and its getTime() method. After that, it's just math.
I have used Akka and it sounds like you could solve this issue with remote agents although you may run into some configuration issues if you are going to be adding and removing workstations. If you are running in a server like Tomcat, then you will run into some unmanaged threading issues as well. I have used Hazelcast and this is a great little distributed cache although not as performant as GemFire. Hazelcast will not solve your problem though, so forget it. Personally I would probably just run ActiveMQ/JBossMQ/IBM MQ and have a master java process put some JSON or XML jobs on a queue. Then adding / removing workstations (slaves) to pull from the queue becomes quite easy. When they finish, they can put the response on a different queue.
Thenewboston on youtube is also pretty good. You should check it out.
Do you go to ASU? I once had the same assignment.
Sit down and do three or four examples by hand. How about: 2011.Mar.03 - 2011.Apr.01 2011.Mar.03 - 2001.Mar.03 2011.Mar.03 - 2012.Mar.03 If you can't do these by hand in ~5min (w/ a calculator), then you'll never be able to write the code. And if you can do them that quickly, it hasn't cost you much time and it may spark ideas for your program. Hint: any intermediate "scratch result" you write down on a slip of paper will almost surely correspond to a variable in your program. 
The problem is that Reddit has no tags. One submission must fit one subreddit, that sux. Many times cool Java links are posted to r/programming because of the wider audience.
as for mascot, how about the reddit alien drinking a cup of coffee ?
&gt; I shouldn't need to declare the type of a generic collection twice. You mean the generic-type that it *holds*, right? Because the actual type of the collection itself matters, ex: List&lt;Foo&gt; myList = new CustomizedListImplementation&lt;Foo&gt;();
My guess is that this is more about learning to use loops, case statements, and if statements than it is about figuring out how many days are between to dates. Using built-in Gregorian date functionality would ruin the purpose of the lesson.
Have your objects implement the Comparable interface and you can just call Arrays.sort(myArray) Alternatively, create a Comparator object that works with your objects, and call Arrays.sort(myArray, myComparator).
You can use the Array.sort method that takes the array and a [Comparator](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html). All you have to do is implement the compare method to use your temperature field to sort by. 
Can you please give an example?
 Arrays.sort(myObjs, new Comparator() { public int compareTo(Object o1, Object o2) { MyObject mo1 = (MyObject) o1; MyObject mo2 = (MyObject) o2; return mo1.getTemprature() - mo2.getTemprature(); } });
Do I place this whole thing in the objects class or just after after the method header? Thanks for your help!! 
You can define the comparator when you are doing the sort itself. You can also create it as a separate class or inner class and create a new instance of it for the compare or reuse one you create before hand. One thing to add, you should parameterize the comparator by doing: Arrays.sort(myObjs, new Comparator&lt;MyObject&gt;() { public int compareTo(MyObject o1, MyObject o2) { return mo1.getTemprature() - mo2.getTemprature(); } });
Now how do I turn this into a side-scroller? Baby steps...
The gregorian calendar in java is open source
magnets! how do they work?!
ok just to get this straight. I have a object class called CityWeatherInfo with a field called TempF which is a double. There is a n array of these objects that has been created at this point. If I wanted to to use this code I would insert this where I want the array to be sorted. Arrays.sort(CityWeatherInfoArray, new Comparator CityWeatherInfo() { public int compareTo(MyObject o1, MyObject o2) { return mo1.getTemprature() - mo2.getTemprature(); } });
Subtraction only works for comparators when dealing with integer-like data; when dealing with floating point numbers, you can get screwed by rounding. Instead, use Double.compare. return Double.compare(mo1.getTemperature(), mo2.getTemperature());
I know this isn't the answer you are looking for, but you should probably just bite the bullet and learn you some java.
mo1 an mo2 should be renamed to o1 and o2 ;)
For simple reading you could use a SAX-Parser. If you do more complex operations than that [w3c DOM](http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/org.w3c.dom/pkg.html) or [DOM4J](http://dom4j.sourceforge.net/dom4j-1.6.1/guide.html) are more useful.
Many thanks. I'm looking at the SAX-Parser now.
[This should get you started](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-xml/dom.html)
Thank you!
If you have an XSD I would suggest the easiest way to do this is JAXB. 
The SAX-Parser will only call a method on a handler for every tag open / close it encounters. This is a bad way to do document modification.
Okay, so would I be better off with w3c DOM, for doing what I'm doing?
Dom would be easier to use for what you're doing, you can work with the entire document model in memory. The benefit of SAX is reduced memory footprint since you're parsing on the fly, DOM reads the whole thing into memory. I'm guessing that's not a concern for your assignment.
zactly.
Yes. 
You'll find that at the beginning, you'll think that your problem is that you don't know the language, but you'd be missing the point. Understanding the problem and understanding how to translate the solution into code are two completely different things (At least for language-independent math problems like this). Use math and your own experiences to figure out exactly how to find the difference algebraically, and write down in order the steps you need to perform to get the write answer. Programming languages are irrelevant at this point. Try your solution against a bunch of dates on paper. Only now are you actually ready to write code. For each step in your solution, determine the best way to represent it in the language of choice. Once you have an ALGORITHM, we'll be able to help you more with SYNTAX :)

I am not asking someone to write the code for me .. it's just I want to understand the concept of dynamic programming for this problem . specially the following statement : &gt; table[ i, j ] = table[ i - S_j, j ] + table[ i, j - 1 ] 
That doesn't mean anything to me, looks like your taking some array position [i,j] and assigning it to some other position in the table but since when did you access an array by passing in [i, j], seems like it should be multi dimensional but then it would be [i][j] and [i,j] is not an array position. Can you give more clarity by posting the constructs for table, i, j, S_j
all I know is it has something to do with two dimensional array int table[i][j], and manipulating it in a way that you can do dynamic programming ( taking less time because you will not calculate the things more than one ) then the answer will be in the last index of i and j 
I just asked around at work and no one has ever seen a data structure that takes [ x1, x2] as parameters. If it was multi dimensional then it would be table[i][j] = table[i -S_j][j] + table[i][j-1] Maybe I'm missing something could be something new that I've not seen before. Anyway if it is a multidimensional array you are taking the position i j and setting it to the combined results of positions i -S_j, j and i, j-1. I've done you a table lol, assuming S_j = 1 , i = 2 j = 2 http://imgur.com/z8qQR The question is too vague to go into any more detail. 
the thing is this site is only show the algorithm, not the data structure So, I have to understand it then convert it to Java language Thanks for the table, and sorry for the misleading but really I don't speak americano :)
ripped off [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) if year modulo 4 is 0 then if year modulo 100 is 0 then if year modulo 400 is 0 then is_leap_year else not_leap_year else is_leap_year else not_leap_year Also you are doing if(leapOrNo = false) this will not work. = means make leapOrNo false. You have already set leapOrNo to a boolean true/false so you can just do if(leapOrNo) that is it. Also in future you want == to compare primitive values and Object1.equals(Object2) for objects. = is purely for assignment such as x = 1
oh wow. i was testing to see if i could change the result. thats y i had "leapOrNo = false". 
i changed it and it works perfectly. thanks a million!!! package week6leapyear; import java.util.Scanner; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { //program title System.out.print("Leap Year Calculator" + "\n---------------------------\n\n"); //declare variables int year1; boolean leapOrNo; Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in); //get user input and setup validation while (true)// infinite loop to repeat prompt {System.out.print("Enter a year. (Enter zero to quit): "); year1 = console.nextInt(); if(year1 == 0)//zero to end program { System.out.print ("\nThank you for using the Leap Year Calculator" + "\nGoodbye.\n\n"); System.exit(0); } else if (year1 &lt; 1900)//validation of year after 1900 { System.out.print(" ****Invalid Year.****" + "\n****Please input a year AFTER 1899****\n\n"); } else//send to leap year calculating method { leapOrNo = isLeapYear(year1); if (leapOrNo) { System.out.println(year1 + " is a leap year.\n"); } else { System.out.println(year1 +" is not a leap year.\n"); } } } } public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { boolean is = ((year % 4==0) &amp;&amp;(year % 100 !=0)|| (year % 400 == 0)); if (is) { return true; } else { return false; } } // Due Date: 10.24.2011 /*Leap Year Method Write a program that prompts the user for a year. Only values greater than or equal to 1900 should be allowed as input. The program should determine if the entered year is a leap year or not, and display an appropriate message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not a leap year. The program should loop to allow a user to enter multiple years. Use a value of zero for the year to terminate the program. The program must use a method to determine the leap year status. Suggested method signature is: public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) The algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year is as follows: The year is evenly divisible by 4 and not evenly divisible by 100. The year is evenly divisible by 400. Input validation: Do not accept a number less than 1900 for the year. You have full discretion about how the output should be formatted. */ } 
The line: if (leapOrNo = false ) should use a double equal sign to compare leapOrNo with a boolean value (although the logic is reversed; if the isLeapYear() method returns true it is a leap year). So it should actually read just: if(leapOrNo)
From looking at it, I think what you are talking about is something like this: if you create a factorial function, and say you computed the factorial for 100, you would be able to write it in such a way that it stored the factorials from 0 to 100. This way as you use the function, it becomes a table lookup rather than a mathematical function. also, as you compute higher values you can start at the last highest value you computed.

A whole lot more work, especially if you're just learning the language now. Aim a little lower and slowly work up -- try something like a one-screen simple tennis game to get the feel of what to do.

&gt;using an int to keep track of the vector size Remove your Vector class and replace it with ArrayList. Vector synchronizes every single method it uses, which adds massive performance overhead. Most experienced Java programmers never use Vector these days. My other suggestion, based on my own experiments, would be to avoid collection classes altogether. There's no reason most DP calculations can't be entered in a standard array, and arrays in Java are implemented similarly to arrays in C -- that is, as a single block of memory which can be iterated through using offsets. Much quicker than creating a massive block of objects. Hope this helps. 
That was a great answer! Thanks! That shaved off a lot more time too!
Factorial isnt the best example of Dynamic Programming. Try computing Fibonacci numbers instead.

Nope, as long as it works. Thanks a bunch guys. I'll work with w3c's dom.
It's done using other frameworks (that abstract swing shit to be more bearable), but yea, it's done from scratch. Those drag and drop thingies doesn't offer that much control you'd need, and if they do, it's 10 times faster to just type it out anyway.
Seconding this. However, I agree with one of the previous posters that for the purpose of understanding the XML document model and the fact this is a learning assignment, using a DOM parser would be the appropriate thing to do.
looks very interesting...how is the performance? I'm currently using [MPJ Express](http://mpj-express.org/) to run some parallel code in java on a cluster. This seems like a good possible replacement that is more java-like
I learned by doing everything manually, using layout managers. Definitely not the most efficient way, but it it's good to get some insight.
yes. create one class with a main method that does: String cmd = "my.exe"; Runtime run = Runtime.getRuntime(); Process pr = run.exec(cmd); then jar it up. 
A a .jar is really just an archive, so you should be able to throw it in with the rest of your application and create the jar like normal. You could then use something like the [ProcessBuilder](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html) class or [Apache Commons Exec](http://commons.apache.org/exec/) to launch the .exe from your jar's entry point class. Also, if you want to do it the other way around (wrap a .jar into a .exe) there are options like [Launch4j](http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/JDCBook/jni.html).
so, example would be like.........String cmd = "Google Chrome.exe"; Runtime run = Runtime.getRuntime(); Process pr = run.exec(cmd); ...... 
in general, there's little reason to use vector anymore. if you need constant time lookup by index use arraylist. if you need constant time lookup by some other key, use a map. 
Author comments toward the bottom that he doesn't blame RIM for deciding not to support Java. &gt;While I feel for these developers, I also side with RIM on this one. The future of mobile is C++ and HTML5. *It isn’t Java.* That shocked me. Am I off base? Isn't Java pretty much everywhere in mobile except IOS? What trend is he seeing that I am missing?
&gt; table[ i, j ] = table[ i - S_j, j ] + table[ i, j - 1 ] In the algorithm: S is the ordered set of coin denominations the size of the set is m one example of S = { 1, 5, 10, 25, 50} S_j is the coin denomination in set S at position j. Basically the line in question is saying. The number of ways to make **i** amount of change from **j** coins is equal to the number of ways of making **i** change using at least one j^th coin + the number of ways of making **i** coins using all the coins up to but not including the j^th coin. 
i'm sure there is a happy medium and like anything, right tool for the right job. Once you get used to Swing and layout managers, you can do just about anything and you have great control over it all. Swing can be a little bitch sometimes though :). As Fuco1337 pointed out, there are frameworks out there that attempt to make Swing more bearable. I have not used any of them yet but i'm sure they are worth checking out.
This is... weird. I GUESS it kind of makes sense if you say that Android doesn't run on Java, but instead on Dalvik, which is different. Somehow. Even though it uses Java classes and code. And that's ignoring the fact that iOS doesn't use C++ either, it uses ObjectiveC.
seems like a step backwards
Nothing. He's clueless, and apparently so is RIM. I feel especially bad for the city of Waterloo, because it's going to cost them so dearly when RIM suffers the same fate as Nortel.
So as usual RIM hasn't stopped sucking Microsoft's cock and they keep telling us what ever it is Microsoft is telling everyone else "the future of Windows development is C++ and HTML 5" and RIM just parrots crap like that. It makes anyone with half a brain chuckle. C and less so C++ have been used for decades on embedded systems, and higher level languages like Java and objective C have been displacing them for a while now. Watch Ruby become a viable development platform for iOS in the next 2 years, while Microsoft and RIM go back to old C++. 
It might be a bit pedantic of me but I'd consider the code more an example of caching. For isolated calls you save no time by caching the results because the calculation is linear. The savings come from repeated calls. Dynamic programming, to me, implies that each individual problem can be broken down into subproblems but without caching the subproblems would involve a lot of repeated calculation. The recursive Fibonacci algorithm involves an exponential number of calculations, with dynamic programming by using O(n) space you can complete the calculation in O(n) time. (Of course you can do it in O(1) space by calculating iteratively) The coin change problem from the other post is a good example of dynamic programming because I'm pretty sure the iterative algorithm requires dynamic programming and recursive algorithm can benefit from it.
Learning the details to a GUI is imperative for writing one that is Clean and efficient. However I think the RAD GUI tools such as the swing plugin from google for eclipse are major time savors. This was not the case 5 years ago when I would write everything from scratch. The tools now adays are much better and will save you tons of time. But learn the fundamentals. They tools help layout components but. Of hook them up or add business logic. 
I hadn't realized RIM was so in bed with Microsoft. Sounds like the author of the article is brainwashed in the same way. At best, RIM has spoonfed "industry" information to him. On a side note, I'm thinking RIM is ripe for purchase from Microsoft.
Thanks. I appreciate the assurance. I was thinking maybe I was starting to lose it.
yeah, though you will have to be able to call googlechrome.exe from the command line. if it isnt on a path that the command line can access, then you may need to add it to the path, or call the full path like c:/program files/google/googlechrome.exe. you will also note that portability of the code goes out the window hardcoding the path. there are ways around that, but you may not be so concerned with that.
Try contentPane.validate() after .add. This is required only if contentPane is already displayed/visible.
You should take a look at the MigLayout library for a sensible layout manager. 
I work as Java dev and haven't really created a swing or SWT UI in like 10 years. For me, it's all been web stuff. So depending on what you're going to do, a superficial understanding of Java-Layouts with the Netbeans drag&amp;drop layoutmanager might be more than enough.
I've not tried it for anything substantial so I can't comment on performance but if you do use it let us know how you get on. 
I agree I've never touched Swing since university, everything is web app these days :)
Thanks for the reply! I'd feel much more comfortable knowing how to code it by hand, are there any resources you could recommend?

I've a background in Web Dev and I always code from scratch. I can't stand the spagetti code generated by WYSIWYG editors. Is the code generated by the layout managers good quality? Or while learning from it should I take it all with a grain of salt?
What would be the best way, in your opinion to begin learning the basics of GUI dev?
I'm a java ee developer, we use jboss with richfaces. so if I want to code something in my freetime and want to share it without having a applicationserver / webspace with app-server, which would be the best way to use my knowledge and share the apps with friends? google webtool kit and host it on google? or are there "free" webspace-services which include appservers like jboss?
Especially the "sharing" works much easier if it's a web page. No one has to install or update anything. Personally, I just use a tomcat. Have a rented root server. Virtual might just do as well.
I come from a web dev background. And can create quite good browser based applications. Is there any advantage of using Java in the webspace compared to another language such as php or python?
How are layouts created for the webspace in Java?
Everything is better than PHP, I'm afraid. It's just a badly thought out excuse for a language. Python is ok, there are a lot of decent dynamic webframeworks for it. Compared to Java, it is relatively slow though. The main points for Java as a web dev language are good performance on a great variety of platforms and most importantly integrating perfectly into the Java environments our clients already have to run their business. Don't make the mistake to use naked servlet stuff or JSP with inline code though. That way it's both overly cumbersome or just as bad as PHP. Succesfully doing Web-stuff in Java usually requires a good MVC framework or different kind of Web framework (Spring MVC is nice... Grails is okay, I guess.. sure lots of others) and use a good view technology or use JSP the right way. 
In web languages generally, JQuery HTML etc.. there are several frameworks that you can try but it generally works that the layout is done in the web pages and interface with controllers in the Java server layer to get required data. Try [Play!](http://www.playframework.org/) as it's quite easy to get going with this and doesn't require a container to host the application.

I've been building GUIs now for a while ever being stuck on a calendar app. The best tutorials to code it from scratch is [Oracle](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html) I prefer writing them from scratch, but it does get messy.
Good book .
besides google (I never tried the google webtool kit, maybe it's easy), do you know any free webhosters with appserver support? 
If you're developing OSGi applications you'll want to read up on the latest additions to Apache Karaf. JB's article cuts through the standard release notes list of JIRA entries resolved to get at exact what has been added or enhanced.
Enums will be your best performance option -- all the data is loaded as soon as the enum is referenced. However, enums cannot be changed at runtime; so if you perceive this being desirable in the future, avoid this approach. File storage will be your lowest-memory option. Performance impact can be minimized by loading and caching data from those files at strategic times (between levels, for instance). A properties file is probably the simplest approach for what you're trying to achieve if the data is organized as simple key/value pairs. If you insist on using a relational database, I suggest looking into a pure-Java option instead of sqlite simply to make deployment a little easier (h2 is a decent lightweight option for relational data, or you may want to consider a document-oriented database since the level data is probably self-contained and might be structured differently for each level). I would avoid serializable classes simply because it affects your ability to evolve your classes. 
try thinking outside the box
Perhaps you should say what you're having trouble getting your head around. The "syntax and logic" are very similar to C++ and there are numerous articles describing the differences. [Let Me Google That For You](http://tinyurl.com/6bh2mmv) 
Thanks :)
Always test. I regret not getting into good habits from the start using [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and now it's much harder to get into it because I'm so used to working by writing and designing the code first and then testing. This little [bowling game exercise](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) walks you through how to do TDD step by step and it a great way to see how professional developers think. 
Hand coding your GUI is usually the fastest, most flexible way to do it. GUI designers may be OK for dialogs only (even though I don't use them for this either). 
I'm not really sure of all the options. I read lots of books on swing and other GUIs when I started. The online tutorials are great. But ultimately diving in to code by either coding many things or reading someone else's code where it was done well. It also depends on the framework - swing is one of the more complicated and robust frameworks. I recently picked up gwt/gxt which has a totally different paradigm for GUI programming. 
For tips and hints, just start reading. [Effective Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/) is a pretty darned good "best practices" book. [Head First Java](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009205.do) is one a lot of people like, but it wasn't my favorite (I may have already been doing Java development for too long when I read it, so you may like it more than I did).
If you *know* that you will only do 20, just use an Array. No need for any type of list.
I've been building GUI's for almost a decade now and I hate doing them manually. For Java, I do like Google's Window Builder Pro http://code.google.com/javadevtools/wbpro/

"Hi everyone, Im doing an assignment for college." Why not try to figure it out, then? http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjbbp.html http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2004/jw-0102-toolbox.html (I'm sure copying/pasting is the easier thing to do...)
I'm all for helping people, but this is slightly ridiculous. You're never going to learn anything if you have to ask for help from the internet on such a simple question. If you don't know how to add an item to an ArrayList, your first stop should be [the documentation](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#add(E\)), not here.
The easiest thing to do is to take advantage of the existing ArrayList methods, and just call .add() after checking for null. You should think about how you want to organize your data though. Chances are you'll be adding on to this assignment as you go, so maybe try to create separate subclasses for book (title, genre, author), author (first name, last name, birth year, death year) and so on. Mix and match the subclasses as data types and you'll have something far more expandable and require you to toss less code. Remember: college is about getting you to think like a programmer, and so you should try to take a step back and analyze what you need before jumping in. 
The layout managers don't generate code, they handle the positioning of elements inside containers. They're similar to the layouts in JavaScript frameworks like YUI or ExtJs if you've used either of them. Not sure if it's posted elsewhere in the thread, but [this](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html) is a good guide to the various layout managers. It's impossible to write good UI code in Java without a good understanding of the various layout managers, though I find myself only using three of them: * GridBag Layout - Very powerful but hard to get right. I've had tiny mistakes in my configuration that led to UIs that looked right but behaved very weird when resized. * Box Layout - Very simple layout for aligning components in page or line axes. * Border Layout - Typical north, east, south, center layout. Typically my GUIs are composed of multiple JPanels with different layout managers positioned inside one another.
If this is a college level assignment, then I weep for the future generation of programmers.
I use sqlite in several cross-platform java tools. http://www.xerial.org/trac/Xerial/wiki/SQLiteJDBC Just throw the jar in, and you're good to go. It has native shared libs inside for {32,64}{Linux,Mac,Windows}, and an implementation that supposedly doesn't need a native library either [although I'm not entirely sure how that works, and I've never needed it...] There's also Derby which is supposed to be top-notch if you need a pure-java implementation, but I found its documentation lacking compared to sqlite, and thus I use sqlite.
Go and talk to your teacher during their next office hours. Tell them about your family/personal stuff and let them know that you've been struggling anyway. The professor will both help you with your assignment as well as giving you more individual attention in the future. You need to talk to your professor about this. You won't learn anything if the Internet "helps" you, you'll just end up shitting your pants during the final.
I'm talking to him Monday, as well as attending to personal matters then. Since it's fall break, I would obviously be there talking to him in person today, but I cannot. Thus, I am asking for help anywhere I can get it. It's a pretty big lecture class, so it's not like he will have a more "hands-on" approach and ask me more questions, but it would be stupid not to tell him. I have been attending tutor sessions provided by my school as well as learning on my own, but I just have setbacks if you can understand. It's hard, but I want to learn.
The easiest way to get help is to: * show someone what you've already learned * ask specific questions to fill gaps in your understanding If you don't do the above, most people will ignore you.
Then email your professor now. Waiting until Monday to talk to him will play like you are making up an excuse for not getting your assignment completed. Pre-excuses aren't viewed as harshly. That being said: Everyone that has ever learned a language has learned through trial and error. New languages are tough, even if you aren't a dummy. My advice to you is to take your best stab at the assignment. Plan it in your head, write it, compile it and run it. Check the results and try to fix it yourself. Look up stuff you don't know. Copy working code snippets from elsewhere. Do everything you can to get it working. After that, if it's still not working, come and ask specific questions. Come with stack traces and your code. If your code is running fine but it's still giving unexpected results; then come with your results, your code and the expected results + the problem you're trying to solve and you'll get a much better response rate. Shit happens IRL. It's not isolated to college. It'll keep happening throughout your work life too. You have to do your best to get as much work done as you can while still dealing with personal stuff. Your professor will understand a partially-complete assignment with your best effort, a legit excuse and a request for extension much more than he'll understand you coming to him with nothing :) I don't mean to be so preachy, but this really will play itself out repeatedly over your lifetime. Might as well learn how to handle it properly now :) 
I did email him, the appointment is scheduled for Monday, as soon as Office Hours begin for him. If I could have postponed it after the assignment, I would, but I cannot. I've done 3 of his previous assignments before, so he kind of knows me. It's just tough after a while when you're in tutoring and when you want to code something and you just sit there dumbfounded looking your tutor in the eye, guessing. And it's even worse when I feel like I need to see code being a visual learner. I can understand what I need to do in English terms but transcribing it to code proves to be a challenge. I don't know Java or Eclipse as best as I can, so that's why I need programming help. Obviously, I will post my code and ask questions on here NOW knowing that I can get that help. It's just embarrassing when you're not that good at it and get made fun of for how you program. But yes, I will try try try, I do not want to copy, I want to learn. Even if it causes me to look stupid, even if people get annoyed here, I really need the help. So yes, I will post my questions here throughout the weekend. Obviously, Thank you very much. Such a long response is well-received and understood. I mean that.
I want to do this, but it's hard through PM and posting on Reddit. I would like that live feel, so I am hoping that whoever can/does help can do so through AIM / Skype chat.
I didn't know what Karaf or OSGi were until today (yeah, I don't get much light under this rock), so I looked [it up on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) and I guess I understand what it is a little better. What I don't understand from that is **why** one would prefer to use it over a J2EE/JEE container? Or am I missing the point? I see quite a few containers on that page using OSGi, so is that just how it's normally used; inside a JEE container?
$100 USD per assignment. Guaranteed A. Payment required upon project completion. No questions asked. To the haters: Outbid me.
GWT is an option. 
I don't know about other people, but I would never call you stupid or make fun of you. Asking questions about stuff you don't know or understand is the smartest thing you can do :)
$200? No, wait. Damnit.
Haha yeah, but my Comp Sci department doesn't have too many forgiving people for making mistakes so I didn't expect the same treatment online here. Well, you can expect some posts from me in the future then.

Grid and Flow I find useful too, and Box not so much. It never seems to align things the way I want. I end up writing my own layout managers for repeated situations, just to make creating the GUIs as easy as panel.add(x); panel.add(y); panel.add(z); It's actually fairly easy to make new layout managers that simply use GridBagLayout to do their work - ie, you really don't need to be a Swing ninja to be able to do that.
I thought this was an excellent article on the JVM options. I've had to use a few of these to shave time off GC pauses. The article kind of calls into question the efficacy of the flags, but IMHO they can be indispensable. This is especially true if you are working with libraries.
My catan boardgame project could use some input: https://github.com/OpenSettlers/OpenSettlers. Coming days I happen to have time available too.
Great, I'll have a look at it. Might be monday before I'm able to contact you.
Join learning with fun and contribute to a Minecraft mod or bukkit plugin. They're all written in java!
I will have a look at it, but I'm not really a gamer (at least since they fucked up Star Wars Galaxies).
I just played Catan for the first time last night and loved it. Your link 404s for me though.
Is the book available in pdf, or some e-reader format? The Pearson store lists the printed format and some "different format" option, with a binder icon.
Is there another way?
OSGi is used stand alone and deployed in J2EE containers. The Karaf project is about providing OSGi containers (Felix/Equinox/etc) with all of the extra bits that would make it a good run time environment for OSGi based applications (it's also good for POJOs). In this way one can build distributions around an OSGI core, for an example see the Servicemix 4 Enterprise Service Bus. As to why one would prefer to use Karaf over a J2EE/JEE container, that would have to do with Karaf being much more light weight and less complicated than a traditional J2EE/JEE environment - that and Karaf having been designed for OSGi from the get go (not just bolted on). Just to expand the discussion there does exist other OSGi runtime environments such as Eclipse Virgo http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/. What distinguishes Karaf from Virgo are its features, support for tooling, and licensing among other things.
Check out http://openhatch.org/ Their goal is to place folks with open source projects depending on their skills/expertise. Browsing around different projects you can find open issues and pick things up as you see fit. They also have an active IRC channel on freenode (#openhatch). People are generally more than happy to answer questions.
joo nit? lol
Thanks, that really looks interesting.

Went there, looked, no Java projects?!?! Bummer...
I am joining as well. 
[Spring Rest Template](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html) Have a look at this, really easy to use and if you run into problems you should be able to find a solution with Google easy enough. As a Java dev I've done some .NET and it was very similar. You should be able to pick it up in no time. 
This particular library is for HTTP protocol only. We need to use native TCP/IP since our app requires bi-directional communication. I will check out the rest of their tools to see if they have a native TCP/IP library.
I've always wanted a JUnit hoodie in the same font/style as the G-Unit logo.
Sockets. See the [Custom Networking Tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/index.html): [All About Sockets](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/index.html).
I do now.
Sockets are built into Java, like in C#. Check the Java API's. Class name you'll be looking at a lot is Socket and ServerSocket. You can find the rest from there.
Watch out for the leap year calculation. if (year % 4 == 0) is insufficient. For example, 1900 is not a leap year. 2100 is not a leap year.
I believe this example shows how to do this: http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/Lockingportionsofamappedfile.htm
Yes. It looks like good ole Sockets are going to be the way to go. I was hoping to get something a bit higher level, like Mina, but that may not be very feasible for Android.
Check open source libraries, someone might have written something to simplify it. [Apache software foundation](http://projects.apache.org/indexes/language.html#Java)

Sigh, I can't believe they still teach CS like this. I think you should try some json api stuff. First thing i would look into is json.org and their java libraries. You wouldn't believe how much you can accomplish by parsing json data returned by web api calls. I've thrown together a little demo using cloudvox's public api, all this does is requests the allocation information on a phone number. Once you read up on how to work with json objects there is lots of great info you can get from the return data. [http://pastebin.com/sSQ2xCDX](http://pastebin.com/sSQ2xCDX) If you take the code ive written it will actually not do anything, its up to you to play with the JSONObject returned by the api :-D to examine the json data returned by cloudvox try this http://digits.cloudvox.com/(your_phone_number).json many public apis return data in this format including twitter. Being able to integrate with remote systems is one of the best programming skills you can learn.
Please remember that Computer Science does not equal programming or development. OP did not mention whether he is doing CS or even a course at all, so your comment might still be useful. But at my uni we teach Java in a (1st year) CS light, so they learn more about abstract concepts about doing things correctly and efficiently, which are easiest explained with these simple exercises that he has put.
[asm?](http://asm.ow2.org/)
Very true, I may have jumped the gun. I understand the point of these exercises for a total beginner. When i was in college i found the lack of relevant projects frustrating. However I had already been coding as a hobby for quite some time.
Yes. Perhaps OP should tell us why and in what context he's learning Java?
Hah oh yeah! I did! Wish I knew what that meant :-p
To be honest, I am learning for programming a FIRST robot. I am interested in broadening my knowledge of the language. Anything sort of tutorial helps as long as they aren't to hard at the moment.
It means you didn't make a method like public Hero(int _health, int _mana /*...etc */) { health = _health; mana = _mana; } in which you can pass values to construct the object.
A constructor is a method that is called every time you call an object of the particular class that has the constructor. 
You're right that he hasn't implemented a constructor (although there's still the default constructor), but that's not why his applet isn't working.
Have a look at [the Java Tutorial page for constructors](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html).
Don't you mean this: &gt;A constructor is a method that is called every time you **initialize** an object of the particular class that has the constructor.
For those of us not on the Java 7 train yet.. @see org.apache.commons.lang.ObjectUtils
The title is misleading (there is no "set" in the article, and it is definitively not "definitive"), but this is an interesting summary of a conference that summarized what appears to be a definitive book. :) The article is an excellent starting point when investigating JVM tuning.
Yes, however, I'm was putting it into layman's terms.
On the subject of the efficacy of the flags, why does everyone seem to include Xms without thinking it through? I had a server thrashing with 9 JVMs running, the fix was simply to remove the option. :) Someone had set it the same as Xmx, and 9 times Xmx was more RAM than the machine had. However the applications themselves rarely needed that much RAM. With Xms removed, the JVMs do not eat more than the available RAM, the machine is fine. (Of course, in the long run, Xmx is going to be reached, but this is not a problem since the JVMs are restarted frequently enough, for other reasons.) Even on a production server, is Xms really useful? All that it spares you is a few rounds of resizing the JVM Heap, is it so much expensive? I've certainly seen no difference.
How do you think he created the math expression images? Did he use Tex and output or something else? 
That is really just a fancy, mathematical oriented way to describe caching a result so you don't have to recalculate it again. It is caching, basically.
For those of us not on the Java 7 train yet.. @see [com.google.common.base.Objects](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v10.0.1/javadoc/index.html)
Methods and variables should be smallCamelCaseLikeThis. An applet is not a normal java application, but a AWT/Swing component. You must extends java.awt.Applet and override the init / start / stop or paint methods depending on what you want to do.
Alright, create is probably a better word than call as that has a technical meaning as well.
The time I've wasted doing this the hard way...
I dropped the "J J J J UNIT" at work around my 40 something co-workers... blank stares all around
My boss now corrects anyone who pronounces it incorrectly. J J J UNIT!
Yeah, I definitely, definitely agree. I generally only mess with the JVM tuning options once I've reached the limits of modifying the code. The JVM evolved to be insanely good at dynamic optimization, and when you restrict what the JVM can do, it's really hard not to make it worse (-XX:CompileThreshold is a great example). About the memory usage stuff, maybe XX:+UseCompressedOops might be a friendly way to reduce memory usage on the shared machines?
neat-o! is querying a jar-file by it's SHA-sum something maven central offers, or is this done via some third party service?

mmmm. I LOVE your blog design. Will investigate the maps, also. Thanx.
1. No 2. Java documentation 3. The "Boxes" are called packages. "import" tells the compiler that you want to use tools/code/classes/methods/whatever-you-want-to-call-it from these packages and when you use code that references code from these packages the compiler will know where to look for it. Yes you can make your own packages (keyword "package"). 4. "Void" is used for functions that don't return anything. When you specify what datatype your function will return and actually it doesn't return anything as a result you use the keyword "void". The reasons some methods don't have a void return type is because they either return something else (for example integer, boolean, ...) or it is a special function called the constructor of a class. Constructors don't have a return type. 5. For Android Java is the right choice. For iPhone the default language would be Objective-C. 6. I don't know DrJava but i would recomend Eclipse as IDE ( = Integrated Development Environment = the programm you use to write your code with / compile) 7. I guess the word you are searching for is "IDE"/"Java IDE".
It's been so long for me that I don't know a good place to start learning these days. Someplace else to look though is the [official tutorials](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/). &gt;For example if I see the line "java.awt.TextArea ta = new java.awt." and I don't know what "TextArea" is, could I look it up somewhere? All of the reference documentation is in the form of Javadoc. For example, [java.awt.TextArea](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/awt/TextArea.html). Ideally, your editing environment should get you to the documentation easily. It's not so important while you're learning, but note that AWT is the old way of doing things and you probably want to use Swing instead when you write your own applications. For example, the replacement is javax.swing.JTextArea. If you're seeing that in a tutorial, it means your tutorial is a bit dated. &gt; What is it that I'm importing, really? To use a class from another package you can use either the fully qualified name (java.awt.TextArea) or you can import it and use just the class name (TextArea). The `*` means to import all classes in that package. &gt; They use the word "void" a lot. `void` means the method does not return a value. Constructors, a special method that's run when an instance is being created, don't indicate their return value -- they're implicitly and automatically returning their own instance ("`this`") -- so that's what you're seeing. &gt; writing apps for cell phones and such? Java's the way you want to go for Android but not for iPhones (I think). &gt;Is there a better program that you would recommend? I've never heard of that before, but professionally you'll mostly see Java developers using NetBeans and Eclipse. (I personally use Emacs with Ant, but I wouldn't recommend trying to learn Emacs and Java at the same time.) &gt;I'm guessing DrJava isn't actually called a compiler, Nope, just an integrated development environment (IDE), or you might call it a "text editor". You're probably using Sun's/Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes a compiler. A compiler is a tool that converts text in one language to another language; in this case, it's converting your Java text source files into bytecode .class files. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), invoked as `java`, can execute the bytecode instructions very efficiently. The compiler is usually invoked by the name `javac`, but your development environment should be doing all the invoking for you. Eclipse is an IDE that comes with its own compiler, though you can choose to use a different one instead. There are other compilers out there, but they have more specialized uses. 
1. Can't help you here unfortunately, although i found [this video series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=SPFE2CE09D83EE3E28&amp;index=1) useful for getting started in java. (although i only watched the first 3 or so.) 2. I tend to use the [javadocs](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/) for most of this kind of stuff. usually googleing "java textArea" ([example](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/TextArea.html)) will get you there really fast. You could also use the [Oracle tutorials.](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) Generally speaking, google is your most powerful tool in this area. 3. import x.y.* means import everything under x.y, so 'import java.util.*' will import everything in java.util from java.util.ArrayList to java.util.Map. Which libraries to import under x.y are determined during compilation. This can slow down the compilation of very large projects, but for now you can definitely get away with using import x.y.* with out any noticeable down sides. (unless a class is defined twice somewhere between all of your imports) 4. a 'void' function is a function that does not return anything. Usually that means it is either doing something directly to the GUI or it is doing some kind of data processing. as for functions without types I may need some clarification here. The only functions I know of that don't have a return type are constructors. (and destructors, but you don't have to worry about that in java) a constructor is a class method that is called upon making a new instance of the class. so if i did: "MyClass temp = new MyClass();" it would call that function first. constructors are used to set up internal data within a class. You can have multiple constructors for a class, but like other functions, they must have different parameter sets. A constructor has no return type and MUST have the exact same name as the class for which it is the constructor. 5. I'm not really sure about the answer. In their most basic forms, Java and C++ are not significantly different in many ways (the big exception being memory management). Java is just as good a starting point as any other language, and I think you should be able to do just about anything you want to do with it, it will just be a matter of difficulty level. 6. never used Dr. Java, but I find eclipse and netBeans to both be pretty good IDEs. (eclipse better in general, but netBeans more designed with a graphical focus) 7. no, Dr. Java and eclipse are both IDEs (integrated development environments) which are programs that generally encapsulate the compiler, a code editor, a debugger, a linker and all sorts of other fun stuff. Some IDEs are better suited to different things. Based on what little know about DrJava, it is more of a started IDE for the new guy. Eclipse is more geared toward large scale, professional programming, but it works well on the small scale as well. At this point, you should try playing around with several different IDEs and use the one you are most comfortable with or like the most. The JDK is also not a compiler if my understanding is correct (and it may not be) the JDK (Java Development Kit) includes a compiler, but also has other important things in it, specifically code libraries, like the awt library. Hope this clears up some of your questions. also, my first wall of text, YAY! Edit: cant make the formatting work, whatever.
Tip: Watch [these videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)
1. Don't know. Generally after you do a few tutorials the best thing to do is going to be just picking a task and figuring out how to solve it with a lot of googling, I think. If you like algorithms, TopCoder.com is a good place to practice. If you prefer swing stuff, try to make a game, and download sample code and read tutorials to learn how. 2. You're going to eventually learn everything you need after a point from JavaDoc, the official descriptions of what everything does. Once you get the hang of things that's all you need. To access it I just google "&lt;name of class&gt; java" and you nearly always get the right page. 3. you import files, as the others said, to use the classes in them, or their static methods. It's very common to "import java.utils.*;" for beginning stuff. The .* just means: everything that can come here (any sequence of letters). You could do java.*; but it would be a lot of memory. Eventually when you have multiple-package projects (the 'utils' is a package. sorta the java equivalent of folders) you'll import your own files into each other. 4. As others have said: void means it returns nothing. you can just use return; to end, or you can just let it run to completion. Something that may be useful: You make classes, and instantiate objects of these classes with new ClassName(). This calls the constructor, which is the only method with no return value at all. It gets the object created and set up appropriately. You can have multiple constructors that take different arguments, for example, public ClassName() and public ClassName(int i). This is called "overloading" a method, in this case a constructor method. When I started programming, I always got really confused by "static": static methods are run on the *class*, not the method. So you can have (new ClassName()).nonstaticmethod, but you just do ClassName.static method. It doesn't get called by an object and it doesn't get to reference to state of an object. System.out.print() and Math.random() are two common static methods in the libraries. 5. Java is, in my opinion, the perfect language to start with: simple and well-documented enough that it's not frustrating, but also used in industry and actually worth knowing in the long run. You'll want to do something "difficult" once you get the hang of it, though: you won't keep improving unless you struggle, in my experience. I think it would be definitely easy-ish to have the program get Midi-Input; I would recommend that you find a library online that processes it instead of learning the Midi-architecture yourself, for now, though. 6. Use Eclipse. Seriously, just do it. :) 7. There's a few "javas". Before you used Java, you had the JRE: the Java Runtime Environment. Most people have this on their computer so they can run Java Applets online. Then, you downloaded the JDK, the Development Kit, which lets you call the "java" and "javac" commands from the commandline if you wish. You probably had to modify your "Path" and "ClassPath" variables if you're on Windows so that those would work - that just specifies where Windows finds the program "javac.exe" and then where javac.exe finds the libraries (I believe). You could code Java in textfiles with that. Eclipse is an IDE - an "integrated development environment". It has a lot of nice features, but the most useful one is Code Completion - it fills in the names of methods and variables for you as you type, making it extraordinarily easy to look things up. Also, it lets you just press one button to run your files instantly, and keeps track of multiple files and multiple projects in the same window. I don't know what DrJava is, but, I imagine Eclipse is still worth using. It's very well documented, as well. Compilers take text code and turn it into 'bytecode', what the machine runs. In the case of Java, there's a "virtual machine" that runs your code - it's not actually run on the CPU directly even after compiling, which is why it can work on all computers the same way. C++, for example, gets turned to machine code after compiling (and assembling/linking... don't worry about it), which can be different based on the platform. 
If you want an easy introduction to Java try www.processing.org and buy the Learning Processing book by Daniel Shiffman
Indeed, in hindsight I could have used create, as that's basically what you are doing, when you initialize an object of a class.
I have no idea what this means.
&gt; I don't know what this DrJava is... almost every Java developer uses Eclipse. My friend really likes the new Netbeans.

different type of lock... this prevents modification. MAP_LOCKED keeps the bytes locked in memory to prevent them from being written to disk and evicted from the cache.
&gt; In these examples they usually do things like "import java.awt*". &gt; What is it that I'm importing, really? Every class has a full name, its "package name". For example, there is a class 'java.awt.Point'. If you want to call its constructor, you say "new java.awt.Point(...)", and if you want to declare a variable of that type, you declare "java.awt.Point thePlace;". The concept of package names are great; they allow many people to all write a class "Date", but really they are separate classes (java.sql.Date, java.util.Date, java.calendar.Date, ...). But as you can guess, it gets old really fast, to have to type the full name all the time. I think of the package name as a 'clan' name. That's where "import" comes in: if you say "import java.util.List", it tells the compiler "Hey I'm on a first-name basis with the class java.util.List; if I just say 'List' you should assume I mean 'java.util.List." And if you "import java.util.*", it means "Hey Java, I'm on first-name basis with everybody in the package(clan) java.util." Btw, class String is *really* java.lang.String. But, as you might be guessing, "import java.lang.*" is implicit in all programs, which is why you can just say "String" instead of "java.lang.String". So really, "import" is not actually required; you can always type out the full name if you ever want to. So "import" only saves you typing. It's nothing essential. (Books rarely say all this, and many people are under the impression that 'import' is required.) &gt; They use the word "void" a lot. For example: "public void init ()". The syntax-rule for declaring a method is: [modifiers..] [returnType] [funcName] ( [params...] ) But some methods don't return an answer, so there isn't any return type. So "void" is written in the place of the return-type (but it's *not* a type -- it's just a word you put when there is no return-type). Fwiw, I've been teaching Java to beginners for over five years, and other languages before that. I think Java is an okay language, but an awful one for beginners -- so many pitfalls, so many ways it obscures what's really happening. I prefer something like racket, esp. since they have language-variants tailored for students. There's a free textbook at htdp.org ("How to Design Programs"); you can also see programByDesign.org. Just my 0.02... Oh, and DrJava is a good IDE (yes, it's an IDE; it also has the concept of student-levels, though you need their textbook/notes to go with those). I prefer using BlueJ, but they're both good. And having the interactions-window to play around with is invaluable.
&gt; [a constructor] is the only method with no return value at all. &gt; Well, you don't *write down* the return-type, but the constructor definitely *does* return a value (the object being created), which is why you can say "x = new Foo(...)". The reason they don't have you write out the return type is that it'd be a bit redundant: the return type would be Foo, and you're already required to have the cosntructor's name be Foo, so it would always look like you're stuttering: "Foo Foo(..) {...}". Also notice that even though you don't write the 'return' statement yourself, all Constructors implicitly end in 'return this;'. 
The JDK doesn't expose this, but you can do it easily with JNA[1]. This is how Cassandra does mlockall[2]. Of course, by taking this route you assume all responsibility for making it work cross-platform, if that's your goal.

I think every programmer should learn: - Java, C, C++, Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Python (optional: Ruby, Groovy, CommonLisp). - And try to actively develop with those languages with most time spent on one core general purpose language like Java. So you should learn a little Java. (But you may end up leaning more towards C++ if you desire) - I don't know about that particular site. But you will go through tutorial sites for days or weeks, cycling through dozens of them. Don't get focused on one. And if you do focus on site, focus on the Oracle Java documentation. - On C++: Java to me is a good general purpose language that can do UI Dev, Game Development, Enterprise Web Apps. C++ is good with native desktop applications, game development. - Don't use DrJava. Use Eclipse, NetBeans or something else.
I personally think NetBeans is a LOT better than Eclipse. Eclipse was really slow and kept freezing last time I tried using it. That was a year or two ago though, it might have gotten better in the meantime...
okay, fair. I was trying to keep it as simple as possible is all.
&gt; Do any of you have any experience with javalessons.com? Do you have knowledge of any other sites that are better? As others have recommended, "Thinking in Java" is a good book. If you refuse to pay for books, then the second best option is the official tutorials on Oracle's site (which again other redditors here have also been recommending). &gt; Is there a wiki or database of some sort that explains stuff? For example if I see the line "java.awt.TextArea ta = new java.awt." and I don't know what "TextArea" is, could I look it up somewhere? Yes. The API documentation, which is available at http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/ &gt; In these examples they usually do things like "import java.awt*". What is it that I'm importing, really? "Boxes" with "tools" like buttons and such? Are these "boxes" included with java in every computer, and can I later on make my own "boxes" to include in my programs? Is there a list of what "boxes" I have, and what "tools" they include? (God, I must sound like such an idiot if I got this completely wrong ^) You'll want to learn about "namespaces" (in general) and "packages" (in Java) to fully understand what's going on here. &gt; They use the word "void" a lot. For example: "public void init ()". Sometimes the Methods don't have "Void"; and it just says "public name of method". What does void mean, really? You'll want to learn about "type systems" to fully understand this. I don't think it's possible for a method to just say "public nameOfMethod" in Java. The return type of a method is always required, so you'll see something like "public int nameOfMethod" or "int nameOfMethod", but never "public nameOfMethod". &gt; Does Java seem to fit my interest, you think? Should I start with C++ or something else instead if I'm interested in writing apps for cell phones and such? Java is the recommended language for writing Android apps. ObjectiveC is the recommended language for writing iPhone apps. &gt; Another thing that I've been thinking about is creating a program that helps you learn notes and chords with the help of a midi-keyboard. I'm guessing it would be pretty simple to have the program receive info from a midi keyboard connected to a regular external sound card? Well, not if you're a beginner at Java (and given that you don't know what "import" means, you're a beginner at Java). You probably won't get to the point where you can read MIDI input for another year or so. &gt; I use DrJava to write and compile in. Is there a better program that you would recommend? I seen a lot of schools use DrJava. A lot of professional programmers use Eclipse or NetBeans, but if you're confused about the what exactly a compiler is, those tools might simply confuse you further. If DrJava is working for you, stick with it for now. &gt; I'm guessing DrJava isn't actually called a compiler, but "JDK" and "Eclipse" are actually the "compilers" that this program uses. What are the differences between different compilers, and what kind of program would you say DrJava is? A "writing tool" of some sort? Eclipse *has* a compiler in it, but usually when someone uses the term "Eclipse", they're referring to the IDE (which stands for "Integrated Development Environment"). DrJava is also an IDE. "JDK" stands for "Java Development Kit", and the JDK is an SDK (which stands for "Software Development Kit"). You need the JDK to write Java programs. There's only a couple of Java compilers: The one included in Sun/Oracle's JDK, the one included in OpenJDK, Sable, etc. The difference, in summary: * Almost all Java developers uses Sun/Oracle's JDK. * People who have strong opinions about open source will use the OpenJDK, because it's more "open" than Sun/Oracle's JDK. * Sable is an experimental compiler developed by McGill university. Probably the only people who use it are academics. So the short answer is: Just use Sun/Oracle's JDK for your compiler. What IDE to use is a more "interesting" question, but it sounds like for your particular case, you should stick to DrJava until you feel like you're starting to outgrow it.

&gt; Is there a wiki or database of some sort that explains stuff? [Documentation. You will learn to love it.](http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html) If you use Eclipse and install the Java source code, you can highlight any method or class, press F3 and automatically be transported to the well-commented source code that explains exactly what is going on. &gt; Are these "boxes" included with java in every computer No. Only the "boxes" that are part of the JRE are on every computer. &gt; can I later on make my own "boxes" to include in my programs? Yes. &gt; Is there a list of what "boxes" I have, and what "tools" they include? Not that I'm aware of. All "boxes" that are in the documentation mentioned above are included. &gt; Sometimes the Methods don't have "Void"; and it just says "public name of method". What does void mean, really? It means the method does not return a value. Any method must return a value, use the "void" keyword to show it does not return a value, or be a constructor. What you describe (a method without a return type) is a constructor, it returns a new object of the class it is a member of. &gt; I use DrJava to write and compile in. Is there a better program that you would recommend? Use [Eclipse.](http://www.eclipse.org/) It's a bit more difficult to get into (some concepts like "workspace" you have to get used to) but once you know it you'll never look back. &gt;What are the differences between different compilers, and what kind of program would you say DrJava is? DrJava is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), just like Eclipse. The actual compiler (which both DrJava and Eclipse uses under the hood) is a program called javac. There are basically two compilers for Java: Oracle's compiler (part of the Oracle JDK) and the compiler that comes with OpenJDK. For almost all purposes they are identical, and don't worry about which one you choose because you can easily have both installed and Eclipse will, at your command, switch to the one you feel like using at any one time. &gt; Should I start with C++ No. Not unless you hate yourself.
I have already, but I'm pretty sure plenty of other web sites have un-verified SSL certificates. For example, the FSF do.
Eclipse is rapidly getting better but is still pretty resource intensive. Get an up to date dev PC ideally with an SSD and Eclipse really shines. 
I shouldn't have to get a new PC when every other IDE I use runs fine on this computer. Even Visual Studio 2010 runs *okay* (it seems significantly slower than 2008 though). NetBeans runs very well, I really like it. I'll have to install the latest version and see how much it's improved :)
As a complement to the answers, I recommend you to try [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/). This IDE is very accessible to newcomers, it comes loaded with good examples, and the website has great tutorials and documentation.
You shouldn't need a new PC for Eclipse to be usable but it sure helps :)
Get Eclipse and write something. Use Google when stuck. I don't see it being any more complicated than that.
I started with Blue Jay which is pretty stripped down and simple, then moved to Netbeans then to Eclipse. Personally, I think NetBeans is easiest to learn with. Be sure to download the netbeans/java bundle, it is easier to set-up everything. Netbeans has a very helpful website as well as a nice graphical GUI editor. I'm just starting with Eclipse, but I can say that Netbeans is more user fiendly. Eclipse seems to allow more fine-grain controls over things though. Projects can be imported/exported between Eclipse and Netbeans without an enormous amount of work. 
paint.net, gimp, kolourpaint (linux only)
And my personal opinion is that [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the best. The somewhat crippled (sans enterprisey stuff) community edition is free.
Inkscape
GIMP
By default, GIMP saves as an .xcf, or something like that. Other paint programs aren't going to recognize it as a picture, so if you're in the "Load File" diagram, they won't show it until you explicitly tell it to show you all filetypes. Might be what your problem is.
I've been meaning to try IntelliJ IDEA. I really like some of JetBrains' other products (namely their .NET tools - ReSharper, dotTrace and dotCover) so I can imagine IDEA would be just as good.
[Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty) works on Android. And it's awesome.
I meant when I opened my computer and navigated to the file, that shows all documents. Shoulda specified
Thanks!! I spend the better part of the day getting nowhere with Mina. Today, I came across the Netty examples and they seem a bit cleaner (easier to understand). So I will be messing with Netty tonight. (Actually, I WAS able to send data to my Windows based server, but the "hello world" string was garbled. And the "Hello from .NET" response string was throwing an exception in the Java app; so I'm able to push data across the wire, it's just that my apps can't understand each other!!) But I'm close.
[Paint.net](www.getpaint.net) is great you should check it out.
I'm not the best programmer in the world, but I would be willing to answer any conceptual or code questions you have. Can you give me an idea of what kind of things you all are covering and what you are having trouble with specifically? classes? polymorphism? functions? pointers? also, you may find [the oracle java tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) helpful. I also thought [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=SPFE2CE09D83EE3E28&amp;index=1) was mildly useful, save for the poorly structured lesson order. Stick with it, the hardest part about programming is learning the basics, after that it's all about abstracting problems so much that it is no longer overwhelming. And remember, Google is your friend.
[This is also his friend](http://www.dickbaldwin.com/toc.htm) PS - Just like zero said, we can help if you let us know what's up. Probably nothing to do with pointers, if your CS department starts out with Java. Definitely let us know which language.
Yeah, I couldn't imagine that they would be doing anything with pointers in java either, but it is a pretty big deal in other languages and sometimes college professors do really strange things, so I wanted to throw it out there.
I'd be happy to offer you some help, I have moderate to advanced knowledge of Java.
I think my professor mentioned it when we were first talking about arrays. Then I never touched them until 241 (or whatever the hell the class where I first did C was). I REALLY REALLY REALLY wish we started with Assembly, and worked our way up to C and Java.
Do your own homework.
troll thanks for your help 
Im trying to learn here and here you go down voting me 
Will do, thanks
Could you give an example of your assignments and the troubles you're running into?
You need to go through some examples to try and keep up. To be honest when I was at university I found it hard to keep up with all the work but once you are in a job and programming 9-5 it becomes a lot easier. Have faith it will all fall into place and become second nature. We did some programming exercises together on reddit a while ago. These would be good to help you get the understanding you need. I think I'll be starting a new one this week sometime so make sure you get involved. [Here is the last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l8hge/programming_task_roman_numeral_converter/) If you need any help then just ask away and we'll try our best to get you moving in the right direction. 
Sorry to hear about your troubles in class. It's very difficult to learn during a lecture since there's so much to think about. It helps immensely to read all the material before class so you're mainly looking for confirmation on what you already read and can ask questions for clarification. I like to read at night before going to sleep (don't touch a computer) then try a couple of little test programs in the morning to try out the new stuff. Finally, here's a good website that's very friendly for beginners: http://www.coderanch.com/forums
Somehow I missed your reply here. I'm not a gamer either. You'll find out that developing for games is a lot more fun than actually playing them. And for something like minecraft it's a really relaxing way to learn without having to bother with non-essentials - you see the results of your work very quickly, and have a userbase of millions of people waiting to use it. Most mods are so horribad (in terms of code), you can only stand out for being better ;)
My university did just that, after an introductory semester with Scheme (Lisp) which was mainly for basic concept and mindset learning and for stopping the new students from running away immediately.
Thanks, I will have a look at it :-)
Hi there! I am willing to help you as a tutor for free. Just created this forum for this purpose: https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/beginning-oop I recommend others to join as well and we might be able to help you faster and help other interested students as well.
Ping me if you have questions (even the basics), I've been coding in java since mid 90s I can try and help you understand the best that I can.

In this article, we will explore how to store any simple file in database through EJB3 JPA and how to code the property field and the proper annotation type in the entity class.

Heh. My 241 professor taught C all semester, except for the end. The last two weeks were assembly. The final was all on assembly. People did not do well.
I love cold (hard) cash.
Well, we learned Assembly in the context of a class called "Computer Architecture". In this class we learned how CPUs and RAM work on the electronics level and how the bits move about and words of bits become instructions. Assembly is learned towards the second half of the class. We'd previously had a class on logic gates, ROMs and such, so the transition was smooth. C is learned in the context of algorithms and data structures, completely separate class. Later there's a class called Compilers that joins the knowledge of both (as well as a couple of others), you can imagine what for ;)
I might have the number wrong (it's been a few years), but C, Assembly, logic gates, and comp. architecture were all lumped into this one nightmare class that I've been referencing. The professor literally told us that the class was meant to weed out the people who weren't serious. EDIT - I had a separate class on algorithms and data structures (maybe that was 241, I'd really have to look it up again). I never got to compilers cus I ran out of money (and couldn't/wouldn't get more loans). EDIT 2 - Ah, the monster class was csc242. http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/info/full/cn/CSC242. Spent the first half of the class going back and forth between stumbling over compiling C programs (some people just didn't get it), understanding C (some people used Java as a crutch), and learning what made computers tick. I hated that class.

It might be better to create a subreddit than a google groups forum; it would save us the trouble of signing up for a new account, for example.
&gt; I couldn't imagine that they would be doing anything with pointers in java either Well, Java's "references" are essentially pointers, except that you can't do pointer arithmetic with them, so you'd need to learn a good chunk of "pointer theory" in Java too.
&gt; Is this really what college is supposed to be like, setting you up to fail? College is obviously not intended to "set you up to fail", but your experience is pretty typical: the higher up in academics you go, the smarter everyone else around you is going to be, and hence the "dumber" you will feel in comparison, assuming your intelligence level stays fixed. The "people around you getting smarter as you go up" effect is due to selection bias: There might have been 96 people worse than you at programming and 3 people better than you in highschool (i.e. you were in the top 4 percent). 90 of the guys who were worse simply choose to go into other programs, like economics or law or something, and so now you've got 9 classmates joining you in college, 6 of which are worse, 3 who are better. But now that means you've gone from being in the top 4%, to the top 40%. If you then go on to get a masters degree, but the 5 weakest students drop out, you've now only got 1 person worse than you, and 3 better, putting you in the bottom 20%! Lots of highschool kids are disillusioned when they get into college and realize they aren't quite as smart as they thought. Some people argue that these smart kids are actually worse off than their mediocre peers, because the mediocre peers learned in highschool how to work hard, whereas the smart kids just coasted along, never developing the skill of knowing how to overcome difficulty (since they haven't encountered any difficulty up until college).
This isn't even a Java question; it's an algorithm question.
&gt;&gt; the constructor definitely does return a value (the object being created), which is why you can say "x = new Foo(...)". &gt; Also notice that even though you don't write the 'return' statement yourself, all Constructors implicitly end in 'return this;'. While this is certainly *one* mental model of how constructors work, it isn't the only self-consistent one. A different way to look at it is that the "new" operator creates an object, invokes a constructor on the newly created object, and evaluates to the returned object. The constructor doesn't return anything (and so there is no implicity "return this" at the end of it); the responsibility of having the expression resolve to the newly created object lies with the operator instead. One benefit of this mental model is that it's more consistent with the bytecode that actually gets produced by the Java compiler.
For those of us not on the soul train yet.. @see Disco Ball
I have not yet had the pleasure of dealing with JPA. Thanks for the advanced warning! So would you recommend Hibernate or just rolling your own DAOs?
&gt; Deletion of objects in relations: IMHO You don't have to map the entire relation in jpa. I don't see any benefit for Author (1) -&gt; (n) Article Relation mapped in Jpa (it costs you only one additional method to get the author for given article). For pagination purposes, you can simply add some redundant info from the author class to article to avoid loading the complete relation. Yes, it breaks the normalization, but who cares. The downside is that you have to write extra code. &gt; eclipselink needs 10... As far as i know eclipselink is not the best (fastest) solution. But sorry, I can't provide reliable information on this topic. What i don't like about jpa is that they didn't manage to map enums properly and you have to put extra code to fix this (ordinal() vs name() is not a choice). 
One interesting aspect is Oracle vs. Google lawsuit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation#Lawsuit_against_Google TL;DR Google reimplemented java platform (Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)) for android, Oracle is not so happy about it.
I don't have time to give you everything, but I can at least direct your search a bit. Java is dominant mostly as a web application server. If you're not familiar with J2EE get familiar with it because that's where almost all the java jobs are. The java virtual machine is also quiet popular for running other, non java languages recent including but not limited to: Clojure, JRuby, Jython, Scala, Groovy. There are two main software choices within the java stack, which application server you will use and which framework you will use inside of it. Some common application servers: * Tomcat (small, lightweight, few features) * Glassfish (Big, fat, lots of features, the standard) * JBoss (Big, fat, lots of features and backed by Red Hat) * Resin (small, lightweight, few features non standard design) * Weblogic (Big, fat, lots of features, backed by oracle) Some common frameworks: * JSF (versions 1.x suck, 2.X are actually pretty cool) * Struts (Old and mostly legacy) * Spring Web MVC (One part of the huge spring world) * Seam (Seems to drive the JSF standard forward) Spring is huge in every way. Big library that lots of people use. Learn the basics of inversion of control / dependency injection (IOC and DI are synonyms). Hibernate is used all over to work with databases in an object oriented way. EJB 3 is just hibernate. EJB 2 sucks. Don't ask about EJB 1. Swing, AWT, and scriptlets are basically dead. Edit: Ah, yes. Android uses java but it doesn't run the same byte code as the jvm. So basically they take java and compile it differently to run on the Android. So you can run java on the jvm. Or you can run other languages on the jvm. Or you can run java on something other than the jvm :-)
By default JPA does track the changes on behalf of the user, and of course you can clone a data transfer object off and do what you will with it. This helps to let relationships be lazily loaded and avoid the upfront hit on related data that isn't required initally. There is also merge(), which is some respects is similar to saveOrUpdate. Here is an article talking about it: http://blog.xebia.com/2009/03/23/jpa-implementation-patterns-saving-detached-entities/ You can also do a JPA query into a new object on the fly, if you just want a subset of data, some aggregations, or other information. This is all through the query and it will return a detached result for you. I would agree that cascading a delete can be rather dangerous, and generally I wouldn't set that on most relationships, although it can be convienient for data that is purely encapsulated by a parent object. it's difficult to say why it took 10 seconds for you, since that's certainly not typical. Most performance tests show performance using OR mapping tools providing performance pretty close to manually parsed and processed code. Since JPA is a standard, if you plugin hibernate or other JPA providers, you should be able to compare relative performance. Of course the mapping makes a difference and they usually detail key factors in performance. If you have 2000 objects and each has a 1 to many relationship to dozens of others, which have their own relationships... etc... it could take a while. Set those relationships to lazy load and you may find better performance. 
I don't have a recommendation at this point. I think hibernate is plagued by most of the same issues as regards to what happens (or doesn't happen) to relations and what happens when you persist or delete objects in them.
It's a completely natural relation "Article has Author". Yeah, there are workarounds but the point is that a framework worthy of the name "Java Persistence API" would not make me jump through hoops to realize basic functionality. According to the only rigerious jpa benchmark I could find, eclipselink on postgre actually fastest among the open source solutions.
oh I am aware of the JPA lifecylce, I'm saying it's simply wrong. You query data, you do something with the data and then you explicitly call something to save the data. That's just common sense. This merge/detach stuff is simply bullshit ... According to the eclipselink documentation all relations lazy load per default and since I didn't set "eager" anywhere I'm seriously underwhelmed by the performance ... 
me too ;) ... not caches though ...
I'm convinced that ORM is an anti-pattern and on the Java platform specifically it will never be what a programmer might want it to be. I have always preferred the Spring JDBC Template route talking to Stored Procedures, which gives me combination of no boiler plate crap, DI, the granularity I need when I need it, transaction management and everything in between. We're heading the JPA &amp; Hibernate route at work and I'm a little uneasy about it. Rightly so, perhaps.
You do, of course, have the option of using the detach() method to pull your object out from entity manager management, and could use merge later to persist changes that you want. I think it's an approach, though I wouldn't personally say it's wrong or right. Having the ability to create custom objects as results, to detach, or to leave it within EM management does provide a lot of nice flexibility. I can't speak for eclipselink, but you should be able to add the annotation details: @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = "fooBar", cascade = {CascadeType.ALL}) Or whatever your particular mapping requirements are. Is it taking 10s to load and iterate through 2000 objects, without doing any relationship traversals? I might suggest turning on SQL statement debugging to see what is going on. That's usually my first step in things, since it helps to show pretty quickly if there is a lot more going on than I would otherwise suspect. It's otherwise impossible to really know where the performance hit is coming from, though again, other JPA providers may be beneficial. 
It sounds to me as if your business objects are tightly coupled to your persistence objects. You are correct in your opinion that a bidirectional relationship between an object and its data store is undesired. In fact, it is a very bad design approach. Persistence frameworks (such as Hibernate and other implementations of the JPA API) sacrifice good design for convenience. If you are building a straight-forward CRUD app, this is fine. But if you need the state of your business data to be independent of the data store or don't want to incur the overhead required to manage a persistent bidirectional relationship, you should not be using it. The better approach is to abstract your data persistence logic away from your business domain implementation. Does this require additional work on your part? Yes, but the control and flexibility that you get in return far outweighs the extra effort. I won't use this as an excuse to criticize Hibernate (don't want to fan the flames of that holy war), I just recommend a less coupled approach, even if you do use Hibernate for the persistence management. [edited for grammar]
Dealing with any type of floating point numbers is a science as they are not exact. Essentially it boils down to doubles being accurate to a greater number of decimal places and if you are using a JVM memory is not likely to be a problem. If you are doing finance type tasks there are specific classes that should be used - the same as if the data is to be stored in a database - which will guarantee accuracy of your decimal places (up to a specified point)
And by specific point you mean infinity.
Doubles give you greater precision and smaller chance of major rounding problems. You can also represent larger numbers.
&gt; If you are doing finance type tasks there are specific classes that should be used Specifically, *not* floating-point numbers. (Just to clarify.)
I've also had terrible experiences with ORM, they sounds great in theory but in practice they always wind up being a total mess. I've wasted countless hours fighting the ORM layer to do something I could do in my sleep in native SQL. Spring's approach sounds interesting, let SQL do what it does best, and just have an explicit separation via a templating mechanism. I think IBatis works in a similar way. Any other pointers to database abstraction layers which don't make the horrible mistake of trying to pretend that the database is something it's not?
Hibernate sucks too, it is way over ambitious in it's goal to make the database act like something it isn't, and you end up getting tied up in knots by it as soon as you try to do anything even slightly unusual. I've heard good things about IBatis, but would be open to other suggestions.
yeah, the simple select * from X takes 10s to return. Thanks for the tip with the statement logging, I will definitely do that. My original point sort of plays into that: I really shouldn't have to ;) 
This might be an absolute noob question but what exactly does it entail to decouple my data objects from by business object? Does that mean I have two very similar classes (*Business and *Data) that I write some glue-code for to convert one into the other? I agree with your point on convenience but I would go one step further: JPA is an API that puts the convenience of the implementors first.
ibatis is something you should check out native sql queries, model objects are simple POJOs. what's not to like?
I would certainly agree when you start playing with JPA.. Annotations.. IoC stuff (spring, etc) and these other things, you run into the whole situation of: Configure Cross Fingers Magic Happens, Hopefully Works! or.. Doesn't Work! And if the Magic doesn't happen, it can be a real chore to figure out what is going on. Some context path scanning thing didn't pick up the right thing, or a persistence unit was spelled differently, or who knows what. I know that if you are using Spring, you can turn up the logging levels pretty easily and see what is happening. Then, in hibernate for example, you can turn on the various logging items pretty easily as well. Granted then you have 200MB of logs to sort through, but better than nothing, right? Good luck! I'll be curious to hear what ends up being your problem there.
JPA and Hibernate are among the worst frameworks/APIs I have ever encountered. Most everything about them is convoluted, complicated full of boilerplate and just plain ugly. However I'd warn against judging the entire concept of ORM based on these. There are some great ORMs out there that are a pleasure to work with, like Apache Cayenne and EOF.
I sincerely recommend [Apache Cayenne](http://cayenne.apache.org/). I started using it a couple of months ago (after giving up on Hibernate/ JPA) and it's easy, even *fun* to use :).
It's provided by sonatype: https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/lucene/search?sha1= 
Memory is cheap. Imprecision is usually less so. Let this be a lesson to you: Just because a metric exists doesn't mean that you should try to minimize it.
int x = 1; // Read the file while (inputFile.hasNext()) { // Read a value from file String fileline = inputFile.nextLine(); // Display file contents System.out.println(Integer.toString(x++) + ": " + fileline); }
You are the best. Thank you so much!
When you learn it properly, you'll shit bricks and be ashamed of this post. 
Or lovely nullpointers in javac when *something* is wrong with your entities. That really gave me some wtf moments! 
Working with Cayenne here for a corp. project. It's working well.
Yes, you can end up with similar classes but only if your data schema represents your business domain that closely. This is common enough when an application is starting out but, as its feature set and complexity grows, this may not end up being the case (e.g. state data that does not need to be persisted). Your design will be a lot more tolerant if you maintain this abstraction. 
Sounds interesting, can you contrast it with Hibernate?
Oh, a thousand times this! I ran so hard into that wall when I went to college that it took me 10 years to gather the guts to try again. I'm doing my damnedest to make sure it doesn't happen to my daughter. She's smart enough to be bored out of her skull in school and finds math classes boring, but loves trying to figure out that calculus stuff I'm doing every day. We changed school neighbourhoods this summer and took the opportunity to let her skip a grade, and she's a lot happier about doing homework. She also studies Japanese on the side so that she has something challenging to tackle.
Can you contrast it with Hibernate? How would it handle a complex query?
For financial, or any calculation you should be using BigDecimal. When it comes to money accuracy is better then speed.
"any calculation involving money" = BigDecimal.
Free programs are great, but Corel Painter Essentials is a load of fun.
easy to say, hard to prove ;) ... i'll be the first to admit that I don't quite "get" it yet but to be honest, the patchy documentation doesn't really help with that. However "on delete set null" definitely *is* missing and the lifecycle as defined is by the JPA spec is great for implementors and sucks ass for users. Not to mention the myriad of optimization that have to be done to get any kind of speed.
&gt;after increasing available memory i get Are you referring to the amount of RAM allocated to your VM or are you referring to the -Xms and -Xmx arguments to the JVM? If you've tweaked the values for Xms and Xmx be sure that you've specified the arguments correctly. For example, -Xms2048 is much different than -Xms2048**m**.
Newbie and Python...student? Wanna be coder? I have taken a year, and studied above and beyond. Point is, my background is primarily functional/procedural Python. I see that Java should be fast. I am declaring types, taking time to compile, all this obnoxious work I don't do in Python. So I can tell that Java should be faster. My problem is that it isn't when I use it. How do you make Java fast? 
Working well with 32 bit floats will get you much further along than relying on doubles accuracy. If you are using floating point wrong and not watching error propagation doubles will merely hide the error for slightly longer and give you a false sense of security. 
Can you describe what is going on here step by step. It will help your learning and understanding of the language in the long run. 
It's the if statements, the stuff you want to do if a condition is true should all be enclosed in curly braces. If you don't have the curly braces only the first line will be executed. The way it works now maxSale and minSale always get set to i each time through the loop. Basically you have: if(sales[i] &gt; max) max = sales[i] maxSale = i which is the same as if(sales[i] &gt; max){ max = sales[i] } maxSale = i as you can see, maxSale (and minSale in the other if statement) gets set no matter what, what you want is: if(sales[i] &gt; max){ max = sales[i] maxSale = i } and make the same change for the other if statement as well. Right now you have both if statements enclosed in some curly brace block, you can get rid of that since it's not doing anything. 
It's not so bad if you are starting a project from the ground up with it. There's certainly a bit of a learning curve, but it can actually be convenient. JPA-QL is very close to direct SQL.
I have to agree. I've been using Hibernate for 5 years and JPA for 3 years and both have served me well... Even in cases where I was dealing with legacy schemas that were never properly designed to normal form. Once your models are properly created, JPA saves you much more effort than you can imagine.
I have actually found that performance from JPA is quite good. Could I get a little more out of hand crafted SQL? Perhaps. Could I get as much work done if I had to hand craft my SQL queries? Not a chance.
Ok so I set the max at: if(sales[i]&gt;max) { max = sales[i]; maxSale = i; } And min at : if(sales[i]&lt;min) { min = sales[i]; minSale = i; } } But it's still not working, I keep getting 0 for min, why?
in addition to brackets initialize your min as: min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
But my instructions say: "Don't forget to initialize the max and min index to 0!"
What is min initialised to, 0?
no only max should be initialized to zero min should be initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE or sales[0]; if(sales[i]&lt;min) is always false if min is zero, see it.
I'm referring to ram allocated to the VM. Those arguments you mention are exactly the ones I've seen but I don't know how to apply them correctly.
Are you talking about Gb Gigabits or GB Gigabytes or GiB Gibibytes? The latter two are about the same, but they're about 8 times greater than the first one.
The question is java, answer is an algorithm, didn't realize it was complicated
-Xms is minimum size of heap (start size). -Xmx is maximum size of heap (set this to 4096m).
Amazing it worked! Thank you! 
We've had plenty of problems with Hibernate. Rolling your own DAOs (full hand-written JDBC) is risky too, because someone is bound to mess up at some point. Still, we had more success with that than with Hibernate. Our most pleasing experience so far is with Spring JDBC, which handles all the technical boilerplate, you just write the SQL queries and the Row Mappers, and deal with a pleasant and meaningful exception hierarchy. One of our clients uses iBatis with success, too.
How do I set these values? Is there a way to tell java to always use these values so that when I start glassfish it will already be set? I'm also wondering why would increasing the amount of available memory be a problem, let alone so serious that it prevents java/glassfish from starting? EDIT: Your suggestion fixed the problem: I had to change the settings in the glassfish domain's domain.xml. I still find it strange why this would translate into a fatal problem. I mean: I add more memory to my computer/server and suddenly all my java applications stop working because they choke on *too much* memory. It may be related to what they call "ergonomics" that apparently use different logic for below and above 4Gb.
Gigabytes, it's the memory that is available to the virtual machine.
I hear that it works, but you should understand why, and part of that would be to understand what you ***should*** be doing initialising the min and max ***index*** is not the same as initialising the min and the max. What you should do is actually check that there are more than 0 things in the array first, then set both max and min to the 0th index in the array, then iterate from i=1 to i&lt;sales.length. You're not actually showing us what you're initialising min and max to here. Also if you're keeping a minIndex, you dont need a min as well, you should just use sales[minIndex] for your comparison. 
Actually it looks like you're getting confused between your minSale and you min variable, at one point you're using it like a min and initialising it to sales[0] like i suggest, but when you find something smaller, you replace your minSale with the index of it instead. You're mixing values with indexes. you have this issue for your max as well. 
So you mean GB or GiB then, not Gb...Gb is quite different...
Thanks a lot for your insightful explanation. I doubt, though, that there are many who would read memory for an ordinary computer as gigabits even if given as "Gb". Anyway, it doesn't make any difference in regard to the question.

Hmm strange. I'm using it in a project and it has caused us nothing but pain...
How large is your project? Do you use any cache synchronisation?
Sure. Can you give me an example of what you consider a complex query? I'll write it up :)
Can you give an example of how it's causing you problems? Perhaps we can help you out?
I haven't done cache synxhronization in Cayenne yet (although I've done it in EOF which is conceptually very smilar. What type of cache synchronization are you wondering about, remote cache/per thread/per process?
1) Open glassfish admin console from adress similar to http://localhost:4848/ (the default username: admin and password: adminadmin) 2) Select application server -&gt; jvm settings -&gt; jvm options 3) Update the parameters -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx2048m This will increase your Glassfish server heap to 2gb, although I doubt you will need this much. If glassfish starts up clean with these settings, then you can try to decrease to -Xmx1024m. Once that works, you can also decrease the 4Gb settings you put on your VM down to 1.5 or 2Gb. Good luck.
Thanks for your reply. &gt;1) Open glassfish admin console Problem was that it wouldn't even start. I solved it by writing directly to domain.xml. But it bothers me that increasing memory would have any detrimental effect, and outright making the program not run if find really strange.
Exactly, if you initialize min to zero, and then compare each sale to zero, unless the sale is negative, min will never be changed from zero. How about setting the initial values to the first record in the array? if (i==0) { max = sales[i]; min = sales[i]; minSale = i; maxSale = i; }
Not sure if this is helpful but you can move the code inside the event listener method to its own method and then call that method from your JUnit test.
If you have to simulate a keypress then it's exposing a problem with how your code's factored - you should be able to test the functionality of the program seperately to its controls. Imagine if some day in the future you had to make your snake program work with an Xbox controller, all your junits would be rendered worthless. I imagine this is actually for homework so the Xbox thing is unlikely, but you get the point - refactor your code to seperate I/O from the program logic and you'll be able to unit test easier and get higher marks.
The normal way to test such things - is create a thin layer between the user input and application which is very simple and thus not a big risk if not writing tests for it. If you are "pushing" the key presses then it is a simple case of calling right methods in the tests. But if you are "pulling" (e.g. checking for a key press before making next move) then it gets more complex - probably the simplest solution is to have a function getKeyPress which gets last key pressed, then in test create an object that just overrides it and returns the char it is told in the test
Responding to all of you guys kind at once here...but here goes. The problem with the situation is that the project requires me to use JUnit tests to check for correct input and output of the program. Currently I have this.. public void testDirectionup() throws Exception { int originX = 18; int originY = 23; boolean movedUp = false; Robot robot = new Robot(); robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_W); robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_W); boolean check = Zen.isVirtualKeyPressed(57); if (originY == 23) movedUp = true; else movedUp = false; // assertEquals(true, movedUp); assertEquals(true, check); The problem being that after doing the testing, the W key is never pressed according to my code, and therefore the code will never pass the test. If I can find a way to simulate WASD input then the code can be finished quite quickly. 
Don't write code like if (user.pressedKey('W')) { ... } Instead write code like if (user.wantsToGo(UP)) { ... } Or possibly position = position.translate(user.wantedDirection()); Or whatever. Point is not to mix the code that is interpreting the input with the code that is acting on that interpretation.
My problem lies with the fact that Java isn't accepting any key presses regardless, so I can't test the code in any way shape or form until I can figure that out. The only way to make the snake go up is to push W, I have it set to default to not moving precisely for these tests.
Forget about the key presses in the test code. In the test code you override your user input interpreting code with a "mock" input that just pretends the user pressed a key, and the code that is acting on that input shouldn't know the difference.
The problem with this is that I am unable to set and use variables between classes. I have it setup in the main Snake class as: String oldDirection = direction; String newDirection = Zen.getEditText(); Zen.setEditText(""); if(newDirection.equals("d") &amp;&amp; !oldDirection.equalsIgnoreCase("a")){ dx = 10; dy = 0; direction = newDirection; } else if(newDirection.equals("a") &amp;&amp; !(oldDirection.equalsIgnoreCase("d"))){ dx = -10; dy = 0; direction = newDirection; } else if(newDirection.equals("w") &amp;&amp; !(oldDirection.equalsIgnoreCase("s"))){ dx = 0; dy = -10; direction = newDirection; } else if(newDirection.equals("s") &amp;&amp; !(oldDirection.equalsIgnoreCase("w"))){ dx = 0; dy = 10; direction = newDirection; } If I could call any of the direction functions from the JUnit class your idea would work, but i'm not seeing a way to make it work as is.
You have to adapt your code so it is testable. You can't expect to write tests against code that's not testable. What you have there is the opposite of my recommendation. You have tightly coupled the interpretation of the input with the code acting on that interpretation. Case in point, "w", "a", "s", "d" are not directions, they are one-character strings. Also, you're using what appear to be static singletons. That makes code pretty much untestable. You'll need to move all that into some other class which you'll inject as a dependency for this class, preferably as a parameter to the constructor.
Hmm, so table A contains guys, table B contains girls, and table C contains a list of guy/girl pairings that have taken place in the past. Randomly get me a guy/girl pair that has not occurred in the past.
&gt; what's not to like? Its reliance on XML config files :-)
You're suffering from stockholm syndrome.
&gt; Hibernate is used all over to work with databases in an object oriented way. EJB 3 is just hibernate. EJB 2 sucks. Don't ask about EJB 1. This is not correct. EJB has pretty much nothing to do with Hibernate. Maybe you're thinking of JPA, which is an ORM specification derived from Hibernate. EJB is a component architecture used to implement server-side business logic and defines a set of services application server has to provide (e.g. transaction processing).
When you to go tools -&gt; libraries, you are adding libraries to netbeans, not to your project. To add them to your project you must right click the project, click properties, and manage libraries from the libraries tab there. Also, in the future, please provide more data when asking for help.
Why not initialize to the first value in the array? This way the actual mins and maxes are guaranteed to exist in the array.
You are correct, saying that EJB 3 is hibernate is an oversimplification. Technically JPA was created to be a standard that is similar to hibernate and EJB 3 uses JPA for its entity beans. However, the EJB 3 spec is an odd mix of different specs. You basically have 3 bean types: Session beans, Entity Beans, and Message Driven Beans. I've never seen or head of a company using Message Driven Beans instead opting to use their JMS implementation's native API. Usually this is due to the fact that JMS is half a spec and leaves so much up to the implementation that there is no consistency at all. Sessions beans are just a simplified knockoff of spring. Entity beans are just a simplified knockoff of hibernate. Since the main change in EJB 2 -&gt; 3 was to start using JPA and some nice ease of use changes I figured that instead of writing a ton about it I would devote more time to more relevant technologies instead.
You should not tie this to hibernate/jpa. Yes, the documentation does suck, for both, and you'd be better off reading the javadoc api, samples and examples, which most people don't. What myriad of optimizations have to be done? I use hibernate+ehcache, and whenever I need to speed things up, if I can cache it (ie: not a legacy application or the resource was ported to be handled by hibernate), I do it. Just a few chars "setCacheable(true)". If I want to cache the entity, I'd just as easily mark it @Cacheable and create equals() and hashCode() for it. You can do most things with Criteria, programmatically or not, and when you get a clue, it is much easier than handcrafted sql.
Well i should mention that the project is very old and cayenne may have come on since it was started. Our main problems are that all of our domain objects have to inherit from generated code and also that we cannot turn off caching, which wouldn't be a problem except that it means that we have to use the cache sync bridge mechanism which is unnecessary complication and generates lots of network traffic! The original design of the system also has instances of data context scattered around the code, but that's not the fault of cayenne...
Last time I checked, hibernate and jpa could do both. If you know ORM that well, you should not be commenting on it.. 
ORM is no silver bullet, it manages complexity. Like you said, once models are _properly_ created, it will work as intended.
I guess you could search around, but I think people look at this page a lot: http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions Simple questions: What's the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList? Explain the significance of a static inner class. What is the purpose of a Singleton? What is the insertion speed of a Map? During an interview, they might ask you to develop classes that will implement a LinkedList. Then they might ask you to write methods that traverse it, reverse it, or insert into it. A problem I got was to build the data structure that would help users search for movie titles using a 0-9 number pad using the letters that correspond to each number (e.g. 2=a,b,c 3=d,e,f), so to search for a movie called "DOG" the user would type 3-6-4. You would return DOG and any other movie that fit that sequence (FOG for instance).
Now, did you do this all in psuedocode over the phone or was it literal implementations? Thanks!
Find out what sort of technology they use if you haven't already and research the hell out of them. If you can, make yourself familiar with any applications you'll be working on. Be ready to ask them questions about their environment. Ask them what's involved in a full development cycle from design, estimation, development, testing, code reviews, QA, QA Fixes, and finally the push process to production. Ask them what they do to ensure code quality (checkstyle, unit testing, etc.). Ask them about continuous integration and automated builds. EDIT: Basically, make sure it's a place you want to work. It should feel like you're interviewing them as well. This, being your first job, will have a huge impression on you and your career, so it's very important that it be the type of place you really want to work. Ask them what sort of career path you'll have and how the company will help you grow as a developer. Ask them about their company culture - do they do things like lightning talks, code reviews, coding contests, etc. Are they agile?
Bring some programs that you already wrote. It's sometimes good that they see that the code you write looks nice (if it doesn't then don't do this heh). If you have 0 years of experience as a programmer then don't worry too much, they won't ask very difficult questions. Other than data structures and algorithms, it would be good if you knew some design patterns, but it's certainly not necessary. What you need to show is a willingness to learn and work long hours. Social skills are a nice bonus if you have those, but they're not crucial at this point in your career.
I am going to assume that they will ask general computer science questions than specific technical questions they expect from someone with more professional experience. That being said, you should be familiar with the following: - knowing how to do things by command line without letting a fancy graphical IDE do the work - understanding of core concepts: performance of operations on certain collections: O(n) (big "O" notation) - basic math understanding (high school level should be sufficient) - basic database understanding (database normalization, indexes) - critical thinking: how would you solve a real world scenario 
Simpler questions will be over the phone. Questions involving writing some code will usually be done in a room with a white board. For the most part, no one cares about syntax, so pseudocode is usually acceptable. Don't be surprised if they ask for perfect syntax, though. They just want some understanding of HOW you're approaching a problem and that you can back it up with good class structuring.
Not at all. I once turned in a programming assignment with a picture of 50 cent on the front and a giant J over his usual G-Unit. It made my teacher chuckle.
Yes, bring them on a USB (that's how I got my first job). I wouldn't print out the code, maybe they won't be interested, but definitely take it on the USB and mention that you have it. If it's a graphical project that cannot be easily started (no database connection or whatever) then you could print out some screenshots. If you have some projects on Sourceforge, Github etc. then don't forget to mention it!
I'd print it out too. They may have security policies preventing use of USB storage devices. 
Any actually coding will be done in person. Psuedocode is almost always fine unless the job is with a specific language. If that is the case, they may want to test your knowledge of that language and ask you to use it.
Order has no method called "getTotalPrice()". Now, you know and I know that really those objects *extend* Order and implement getTotalPrice, but java's static compiler doesn't know that. You have to tell it that: ((Donut) Order.get(i)).totalPrice(); Or you can give Order an abstract method: class abstract Order{ abstract public double getTotalPrice(); }
Even if you don't bring the code in physically, think back over projects for anything that might apply for this job. Big projects, small projects, class projects, personal projects, whatever you have. It is nice to be able to say that you have worked with whatever they might ask you about, even if you can only say you tinkered with it for a couple days.
There is Donut and Coffee both extending Order, so the first "solution" is not really a solution. And even if it only ever was Donut, it's a stupid solution :P
I cannot agree enough about asking questions. You want them to know you are interested in them, and honestly you want to make sure that you really are. Don't let them think that you just want to work on them for a paycheck and something to put on a resume. They won't hire you for that. Ask about their process (like Mr. Anus mentioned above), ask about their team size, ask about their internal tools they have developed, ask about successful products they have made, ask about achievements their company has had (check their website to find one that interests you). The key is to get them talking about what they do and how they do it and show your enthusiasm. An interview where questions only go one way is a poor interview.
 abstract class Order { public int quanity; public Order(int quanity) { this.quanity = quanity; } ** public abstract double totalPrice();** }
I've been interviewing young developers lately for an entry level position. The ones that stand out to me are the ones that are able to show that they are motivated to learn and the ones that bring in/talk about projects that they have worked on on their own. Here are my suggestions... Have tons of questions prepared. Ask about the work and about what it is they do. Ask them to show you the product(s) and maybe even some code. Again, show that you want to learn. Try to talk to the interviewer on a personal level. Don't just answer their questions - ask your own. After interviewing XX candidates you need to stick out and simply answering my questions correctly doesn't necessarily always accomplish this. PS - if you don't know the answer to a question, just say I don't know but within 5 minutes of my arrival at home I will know it. I drives me crazy when a candidate fiddles around trying to make up the correct answer and then gets it wrong. 
It's not enough to teach someone the right way. You have to teach them why the wrong ways are wrong. Perhaps I should have been clearer that the first way was not preferable.
Nice article, a lot to process and understand here. 
The best part is that you've bothered to slap a CC license on it.
I guess I went a little overboard. I also love creative commons. What can I say
I am currently about to take my java midterm for college and already 60% of the class flunked out im using reddit to keep me calm .........
Instead of if (originY == 23) movedUp = true; else movedUp = false; assertEquals(true, movedUp); why not assertEquals(23, originY); ?
To be fair, it's not clear to me what more data he could have provided in this situation.
Because the Criteria is such a joy to use and impresses everyone with its succinctness?
&gt; if you don't know the answer to a question, just say I don't know but within 5 minutes of my arrival at home I will know it. I drives me crazy when a candidate fiddles around trying to make up the correct answer and then gets it wrong I would disagree with this. You can admit up front that you don't know the answer, but at least think about the question and give it a try. I always like seeing an applicant's thought process when they are approaching a new problem, and how they use their existing knowledge and common sense to come up with an answer. Also, one thing I always tell them is that it's a job interview, not an exam. They don't have to know everything, and not knowing an answer is perfectly normal. I want to see how deep their knowledge is, what are the things that they know, and what are the things they don't know. If everyone knew the answer to all of my questions, then everyone would score 100% and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between their performance. All of the above is especially true for junior positions. I don't expect them to know everything already, I just want to see their potential.
Nice work. My minor nitpicks: * Instead of asking the user to provide numChoices, infer it from choices. * Consider accepting a Collection&lt;String&gt; rather (or in addition to?) String[] * Make your instance robust to modification to the underlying array/collection by performing a copy of the data. * Allow the user to pass in streams so that the instance works on something other than System.in and System.out (e.g. System.err, or over a socket or file, etc.). * Your program doesn't handle negative input, e.g. -5 * Consider catching the specific exceptions thrown (InputMismatchException, NoSuchElementException and IllegalStateException in this case), rather than the generic Exception. This is particularly important if you start allowing other stream-types, which might thrown exceptions other than the ones you've coded for. * From an API point of view, the name "buildMenu" doesn't make sense. I want to get the user's selection, not build a menu. I'd name the method something like "getUserSelection". * Add JavaDocs to document the contract of the methods. * Add checks in your constructor so that passing in a null value for the list of choices can be caught right away, rather than failing at some arbitrary point in the future.
&gt; My java teacher always says use a double though. Your teacher is wrong; generally, be suspicious of advice containing the terms "always" or "never". There are situations where it makes more sense to use float than double, for example: a 3D graphics library might require as part of its API for all of its inputs to be provided as floats. If that is the case, it is probably better to natively store your data as floats as well, rather than storing it as double and converting back and forth between API calls.
Good luck, my java 2 test is tomorrow... I tried thenewboston on youtube which is slightly helping
These days, you can customize the superclass template and do whatever you want; for example, I can make the generated classes implement an interface so they behave like business objects from another domain. I haven't had to deal with cache syncing, since the project I'm working on is going to be a single-server solution.
Q: How do you programmatically navigate a tree structure? A: Recursion
Good luck. I've got a test on Inheritance this Thursday, feeling suitably prepared.
Thanks for the suggestions. It is the first code I have written that I felt confidant enough to put out there for others to use, most of my stuff has been strictly for homework assignments, so making things general enough for universal use is new to me. 
I've had companies do a screen share and ask you to code during a phone interview. Having them watch every keystroke is nervewracking as fuck.
That would be awful.
Also class name should always start with a capital letter
How about the imports statements that are underlined in red? 
I've been watching them too thanks guys and I love of people down voted me for this Good luck as well 
Do you have a laptop you can bring in?
Wouldn't a stack reduce function overhead?
But don't forget the effects of the cache. If you're working with big datasets that your code has to go through, floats will perform better because the cache can be used more efficiently. I once was in this situation (in a C++ project) where I made the comparison, and floats were definitely better. In this case the numbers were measurements with an error of about one percent, and the calculations weren't complex so error propagation wasn't an issue. So in this case floats were definitely better.

Review your resume, remember what is on it. In my first interview, I was asked about a little snippet on my resume that I had completely forgot about it. The question tripped my up and started a series of mistakes for the majority of the rest of the interview. Stay calm. You're interviewing them as well.
Google for "java sound" or "java mp3". That will lead you to the Java Media Framework and the MP3 plugin. Also it shouldn't be hard to move the Applet code to pure Swing.
 static AudioClip song1; static URL audioPath; static JPanel GamePanel; public static void loadAudio(){ //load audio files audioPath = GamePanel.class.getResource("audio/alllevels.aif"); if(audioPath != null){ song1 = Applet.newAudioClip(audioPath); } } Then you can use [these](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/applet/AudioClip.html) on the AudioClip object
Oh thanks a bunch! Just a quick question, how does this line work : audioPath = GamePanel.class.getResource("audio/alllevels.aif"); By this I mean, what am I setting equal to this URL? 
It's been a while since I did this, so anybody please correct me if I'm wrong here: I believe that Class.class.getResource(path) references a filepath relative to the class file denoted by Class (in this case GamePanel). So in the same directory as GamePanel.class there's also a file in audio/ called alllevels.aif. That line returns the url of the file, which is then used in the following line to initialize the AudioClip. [Java API getResource](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html) I believe that since the audioPath variable is static, the line needs to reference the entire class, rather than something like this.getResource(path) which would reference only an instance of its containing class. Hope that's helpful - if you want to see that code in use, [here it is](https://github.com/emmett9001/Spaceratops/blob/master/GamePanel.java#L58)
We're not going to do your @#*$ing homework for you!
my homework is not to find wich one is faster it is to write the whole program (for counting euro coins). I just wanted to get some input if its worth not using modulo (since its a rather complicated calculation) in this case.
1. Benchmark it. 2. Doesn't matter. I'll bet you anything that's hardly the slowest part of your program.
I tried to benchmark it via the system time, but that didn't work great because theres to much variation. Since im new to java (and programming in general) i have no idea how to benchmark something like that correctly.
Run each statement a million times, and time how long that takes. That should remove most of the variation. I agree with kreiger though; it doesn't matter. Go with what looks better to you.
I would go with remainder = remainder % 100; I don't know if it is faster or not. It doesn't really matter for that operation anyway. In my opinion it is clearer to others who might read the code that you are getting the remainder. With the other method it'll take a bit longer to digest what you're doing. I would honestly be surprised if the speed difference was significant.
Thank you very much :) The first way is actually a lot faster than modulo. I tried with 1000000000 repetitions and it turns out that modulo is ~4 times slower than the first operation.
it's not that reliant on xml since 3.0
what i meant is that one can have pure non-annotated objects and keep their mapping to relations separate from their definition. calling annotation laden object "plain" is a bit of a stretch IMO. MyBatis 3 does the same thing dao interfaces and i don't like that either. ..and yeah, you can do native SQL in hibernate but it's not the most pleasant experience, again IMO.
The funny thing about trying to optimize code for a JVM is that what is true in your setup may not be true in another. Generally the suggestion is optimization is the byte code compiler's job, unless you experience system breaking performance, don't bother optimizing because you don't know if the next JVM release will turn the whole thing on its head.
If you're majoring in CS, I'd suggest you change your major. If this is merely required for whatever you are actually studying, then I'd suggest you find someone helpful in the class itself.
I'm majoring in networking but this is the first year so they make us take DBMS and AppDev. I'm getting the fuck out of programming ASAP. He just told us the entire assignment is in the textbook and you get walked through it so I'm not as worried. Maybe if I got off reddit during class this wouldnt happen.
I'd suggest spending time with text book and searching for Java tutorials in Google - e.g. [Arrays](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html)
Send me a pm with the assignment and I'll do my best to help you through it.
Even if you're majoring in networking, you can't get away from basic programming. I'm now a Software Dev, I need to know about Operating Systems, networks etc. It's all inter-related. In the future, you might need to write Perl scripts to do magics :)
I struggled through my first Intro to Comp Sci course, and actually ended up dropping it. Gave it another shot a few semesters later (was required for Computer Engineering), but had a different professor, and I understood what was going on completely. I ended up taking a few Data Structures courses after the intro class, and decided to switch my major to Computer Science. I graduated with my degree in Computer Science a few years ago now, and I love what I'm doing in the software development realm. Keep trying man, and if all else fails, try it again at another point with a different professor. Also, what question do you have about Java arrays?
Don't use static anything, never. Come back when you fix that :) (also, attribute declarations usually go to top)
It's an entire assignment. Last class we did copying arrays I pretty much went "fuck" and gave up. If I have to retake it its not a big deal.
This might help: [Beginner Copy Array](http://www.roseindia.net/java/beginners/CopyArray.shtml) If you have additional, more specific questions, feel free to ask. 
Jlayer is a free and open source mp3 lib for java. The JMF only supports certian platforms for advanced codecs like mp3, jlayer is universal!
In a JavaEE 6 environment, a native sql query in hibernate is much easier than a jdbc preparedstatement/resultset/etc, provided you set it up. Annotations on a pojo is not a bit of a stretch, I generate all my classes from reverse-engineering (hibernate-tools), using ant tasks, and can easily update mappings if I have to. DAO is horrible, too much boilerplate for the same thing, over and over and over.. I prefer a "crud" approach. I make "service classes" that the managed beans interact with, using CDI to inject.
Ooh, thanks, I will look into it. Is it MP3 only?
Add more XML and annotations.
So, I'm going to go ahead and say that there are plenty of good times to use static, though this class is a clear example overuse. 
Give me one.
A please would be nice, but here are three: 1) Any class wide variable should be kept static to reduce the need for copies of it public final static int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10; //Such as a constant 2) Any stateless function should be kept static for maximum reusability 3) Factory methods should often be static, so that you can create an instance of your class from the class itself. 
1) Constant should be put in a config file and loaded to a passable config context 2) Stateless function should be abstracted to a service 3) Somewhat acceptable, but use DI next time.
1) Sometimes it's an acceptable choice to add that amount of developer overhead, sometimes not. How often is DAYS_IN_A_WEEK going to need to be changed? 2) Sometimes that's a good choice. Not always. 3) Dependency injection is great, but not a silver bullet. 
Your code is largely procedural, which can become difficult to manage in a large-scale application. You also aren't doing as good a job separating concerns as you could be, or hiding implementation details. For instance, say that you wanted to change your representation of a board; maybe you have some super-efficient rep. of a giant tic-tac-toe board that uses some weird Map structure. You'd have to change *every* method! Instead, you could encapsulate a board as a Board, with methods like board.mark(Position position, Player player) (note the kinda bad variable names ;) ) and board.isGameOver). A good rule of thumb: it should be difficult for an object to be put in a "broken" position; but if you were to screw up editing your array somehow, your implementation would freak out. A good object hides details that its clients don't care about, and prevents clients from leaving unnecessary inconsistencies in its state (this is *not* the same as protecting a client from himself). Another thing you may want to consider is using some enums in a few places. For instance, if you accidentally pass "x" as the turn instead of "X", everyone freaks out. An enum is type-safe; you can't pass "Y" instead of Player.X. (You might want to call them Player.ONE and PLAYER.TWO instead, since You might someday make tic-tac-toe with images or something). Finally, your choice of public/private seems to be largely-arbitrary. Get into the mindset of making fields on the object private *unless you find a good reason not to*. For instance, you bare the scanner to the world; another class could screw up your scanner, putting you in an inconsistent state!
[Check out these free tutorials](http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/csajsp2.html), includes the source code with examples for Java programming, servlets, and even some Java tech like Spring, Struts, etc.
Also function names should be changed to things like "pickWhichPlayerGoesFirst()", to be as long as possible. And create an "AbstractBoardFactoryFactory" class that creates a factory to create an abstract board which can then be made into the tic-tac-toe board. Serious answer though, your field declarations are bad. To be more Java-esque, they should be at the top of the class, and it is really bad practice to have the initialization outside of a constructor. Since you can't have a constructor in a static class, I'd put them in the top of the main() function. As you currently have them the compiler isn't really sure when to initialize the fields, and there can be weird problems with that. The Java compiler is normally good about it, but best to just remove any potential problems.
Wow, thanks. So if I'm reading this correctly, a better way to implement this would be to make a different class for Board, Position, and Player? The Board class would have several methods: * mark(Position,Player): would place a piece for the specified "Player" * isGameOver(): would check if there's a winner The Board object would have a **private**, **non-static** String[][] object that holds the arrays for the game board. The Player class would simply have a variable that decides what it's tokens look like. (?) The Position class would have two variables, one for the column and one for the row. The constructor would simply break up the input and figure out which column and row it represented. I've never used an enum before so I guess I'll make it a personal challenge to correctly implement one in this code. As for the public/private things, all those variables could be private right? Because they don't need to be accessed by another class? Thanks again for the help!
You've got the general idea. There are a number of different object choices that fit this game; it's not cut and dried, so use your creativity. When you pick something as an object, you want to think about the object's *contract*: what behavior does it perform, and what does the user of that object have to do to ensure that behavior? The rule is to make the implementation do exactly that behavior, and to freak out (rather than fail silently, or with an implementation-specific error) when it is placed in an inconsistent state by the client. So, for instance, a Position object might throw an exception (an IllegalArgumentException, for instance) if its constructor is called with a negative index, or with one that is too large. Things like board-size, which can have an impact on the client, *should* be public, and, since they are not object-specific, static. Another goal is to not allow these objects to be fooled with, so you should only make public those objects which are immutable (means that nobody can change your instance under your nose). Most primitive types are *not* immutable, but can be made immutable by declaring them final. Note that final is not a magic keyword; declaring an array final will still allow your users to change the values, for instance. Enums are easy; you declare them with syntax: enum Player { X, O; } And use them much like objects: Player player = Player.X; switch (player) { case X: ... } You should consider an enum whenever you have a finite space of objects, so you can use them for things like game state (X's turn, O's turn, game over, etc.). For instance, why a private String[][] board? Why not private PositionState[][]? (blank, X, O). By the way, make sure to make globally-important constants stay somewhere special; so, don't have a constant BOARDSIZE on the Board *and* the Position, for instance. Good luck! (And Player would probably just be an enum, btw.)
Yeah, I have to say that's a really bad rule of thumb. Static values ALWAYS make sense for constants (and help the compiler optimize). Additionally, if you're going to use the singleton design pattern, you pretty much need to use a static method. Furthermore, static methods can actually help with encapsulation. Say for example you want a method which is entirely dependent on publicly accessible values for class instances. Which provides better encapsulation: A.foo(x, y); or x.foo(y);
I love it when people choose to discredit the question rather than attempt to answer it...
It was already answered in another users post. Unless I mistook your post for sarcasm, in which case, you're welcome!
Also, you could stick in a Factory or two. . .
Make a board game, for example, checkers. 
These seem good if you're already a developer and just need to know how to do x. My situation is that I can hack together a script in a pinch but am not a programmer. So I'm trying to learn software dev by using Java.
I should clarify a little. I'm a beginner coder and am using Java to learn programming and OOP in particular. So I'm looking for resources (like the CS106A was) that teach programming via Java.
good point. java.util.Calendar has 49 static fields "config file and loaded to a passable config context" === configurable parameters. 
So are you doing it 1000000000 times in your program? Otherwise it doesn't matter, and then modulo is better because it more clearly communicates the intent, which is more important. And note that on another hardware platform or JVM, modulo might be faster. Just because something is faster on your computer does not mean it will be on all. "The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet." — Michael A. Jackson
The singleton design pattern should be avoided as much as possible though. It's basically a global variable. It is a crutch and hinders good design and testing.
Why it took so long? And why not use "-XX:AggressiveOpts"?
I don't want to be mean or anything, but if you're struggling that much with beginning learning assignments, maybe programming isn't for you. It's not going to get easier from here on.
FYI on Windows the JVM Memory ceilings are 1.5g for 32bit and 8g for 64bit. If you can fit you structure into 8g then sweet. Solaris can have up 20g 64bit JVM's from what I remember.
Does this apply for OpenJDK on Linux? EDIT: Probably not: ["For 64-bit process models, the maximum is essentially unlimited."](http://java.sun.com/performance/reference/whitepapers/tuning.html#section4.1.2).
&gt; and help the compiler optimize no. &gt; Additionally, if you're going to use the singleton design pattern So singleton instead of static is somehow magically ok now? It's the same damn thing @_@ &gt; Say for example you want a method which is entirely dependent on publicly accessible values for class instances. Which provides better encapsulation: I have no idea what your example is demonstrating.
If you want a job in comp sci I think you're going backwards. Your job will be to take real-world problems and turn them into algorithmic solutions... not be handed algorithmic solutions to real-world problems to implement.
Just like you would finding any other job. Try going on some informational interviews, and talk to people about their careers and how they got into their current position, and at the end ask them if they know anyone looking to hire a new Java developer. This is easy because most people like to talk about themselves and like to feel helpful, and for you it can turn up some leads. 
Read a lot of articles about how to hire engineers, which will give you a better sense of what employers are looking for than articles about how to interview. Google "smart and gets thing done". At this stage in your career, a recruiters are fine, but you will likely outgrow them in a few years. Also craigslist is good. It's helpful to have a side project online somewhere, too. That puts you ahead of virtually every other similarly qualified candidate. Good luck.
* acquire a smart suit, shoes, shirts and ties (no joke ones) or if female try to match same level of formality * produce CV * get CV proof read * search a good Job Site for your area/trade (e.g. [jobserve](http://www.jobserve.com/) is where I start in UK ) * apply with appropriate cover letter to those adverts that are appropriate (try not to blanket send to every job) when invited to an interview * turn up smartly dressed in suit/formal clothing * research company so you know what they do * learn to listen and not waffle (sometimes it is better keep quiet than put mouth into use without support of brain - my problem at interviews) * try and seem interested in the/role company it will likely take time, many applications and several interviews that don't work - so don't let it demoralise you and keep trying to research and refine the process
Most of the good jobs come from being recommended by someone. Are you a hermit or do you know a lot of programmers? I'd hire someone recommended by a trusted employee over just someone based on their resume. Do you actively cultivate a network of people who can help in your career? Participate in meet ups? Open source projects are one way to get experience and meet people. Find one that is used widely start contributing and participate in the on-line forums. At 24 you're probably still pretty green but you could help write tests and fix bugs. I'd be more impressed in someone contributing to a larger, successful project than someone who started a project that went nowhere. Knowing Java alone isn't going to get you through many doors. Do you know how to write a web app front to back? Including basic HTML CSS JavaScript as well as how to hook up to web services and databases? Do you know how to use Ant, Maven, or Ivy to create a basic build? Do you know the basics about deploying a War on Tomcat or some other web container? Nobody expects you to have mastered these things at 24 but you don't want to have that deer in the headlights look when asked about them. If you can, get to know what tech is being used by a company before your interview and at least have something to say about each part. 
The only thing I would add (which really applies to the last 3), while learning a little about the company. Come up with 2 or 3 questions to ask the interviewer about the company or your role. This adds to your genuine interest and, if they don't know the answer and offer you a follow up, they'll more likely remember you. Don't set the bar too high. I worked for a very small startup making basically minimum wage not even doing programming, just cleaning computers of porn and doing hardware replacements, but I also learned a lot because the company also dealt with media programming, website development and managed their own databases/networks. The experience was worth way more than what they paid me and eventually led to the job I'm at now. EDIT: Also, don't be afraid to say "I don't know". Saying that and asking a few questions could clear up the question so you could answer it and will tell them you are able and willing to learn. Plus it comes off better than guessing and sounding like an idiot. A good interviewer will know when you're guessing and will stop listening and dismiss you. Even in the workplace, its ok to admit you're wrong, you learn more that way.

The whole point of a software engineer is to bridge the gap between domain knowledge of the users and programming code. If you are honestly having trouble converting non-technical knowledge into an "algorithm" then you are most probably going to be really bad at every real-world programming project I am likely to throw at you.
I agree, singleton isn't a cure all.
Ahh, gotcha. In that case I've honestly found [stackoverflow.com](stackoverflow.com) to be a pretty awesome resource for beginner questions and discussions. Search on the Java tag, OOP tag, and basic programming tags and you'll find all kinds of tutorials, tips and tricks. There is some posturing and crap that goes on there too, but its minimal.
The CS106A course did some games. I had to build breakout, hangman, a space invaders type thing, and I think another one or two. But what worked for me was that they lectured on the tools you'd need to do that first. Graphics, mouse &amp; keyboard listener, nested loops, etc., so that that was in my mind before being set loose. To try to use another example, if someone told me to build a chair, I could probably muddle through it. But if someone showed me the best way to use a lathe, mitre saw, and router first, it'd go a lot better... and I'd be establishing good habits in the process.
If *static* were an evil modifier, I'm pretty confident it wouldn't have been added to the language. &gt; no. Static constant values allow the compiler to compute anything solely dependent on them at compile time, instead of at run time. Like say for example: public static final double E_TO_TEN = Math.pow(Math.E, 10); &gt; So singleton instead of static is somehow magically ok now? It's the same damn thing @_@ Would you prefer if I used the word *enum*? &gt; I have no idea what your example is demonstrating. It wasn't an example, it was a question. Which one provides better encapsulation? A method that has access to every member variable in the class, when the necessary values are provided through public accessor methods, or a static method that uses the public accessor methods. If you're really serious about coding in Java, I recommend you check out Josh Bloch's [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319732759&amp;sr=8-1).
I don't know if it exists, but you've got me wondering about potential ways to implement it. It's dead easy to code a simple long array -- just use an array within an array, or an array within an array within an array, and index into it with a bit of bit-shifting. This uses 21 bits per level for 2^63: E get(long index) { return (elementData [(int)(index &gt;&gt; 42)] [(int)(index &gt;&gt; 21) &amp; 0x1FFFFF] [(int)(index &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0x1FFFFF] ); } This uses only two levels but only gets 2^**62** : E get(long index) { return (elementData [(int)(index &gt;&gt; 31)] [(int)(index &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF] ); } If "E" is an object (as it must be to "duplicate the functionality of the List and Map interfaces"), then that's 2^31 * 8 = 16 GB chunks of memory per low-level array just for the pointers(!), which might be more memory than is available contiguously even if it's available in total, so that's a disadvantage of the 2-level array. But it's hard to conceive of the extraordinary amount of RAM you'd need to make such arrays really viable. However they're implemented internally, I wonder how best to integrate long collections into the standard Java collections framework. Is it wise to try? Unfortunately all of the collections interfaces return an int size(), and use ints in some other methods. Should hypothetical interfaces "LongList", "LongMap" etc extend or duplicate their int-based brethren? Extending would add extra methods, retaining the normal methods for source compatibility with the interface, just throwing run-time exceptions for methods that depend on ints, like size(). But then a LongList is not a proper List because it doesn't support a common method, and you don't get a compile-time guarantee that all the code in an application is able to cope with the long collections. Throwing the exception only when there are more than 2^31 items is even worse because then it's hard to get even a run-time guarantee that it will always work. Write one accidental call to size() instead of sizeLong() and you've got a crash waiting to happen. Duplicating the interfaces would allow compatibility to be guaranteed at compile time, which is much preferable, but then you have to duplicate *all* parts of the interfaces and all code that wants to interact with them, even if it's only using safe (not int-dependent) methods like Collection.addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt; c). Maybe it's better to ignore the collections framework and just make an ad-hoc "LongArray", or just ad-hoc primitive arrays (avoiding the overhead of object pointers), until there's a practical need for something more structured. I think we'll be in the terabyte RAM era before there's common need for more than 2^31 items in Java collections, or enough RAM to support long collections of big objects (instead of mere bytes, ints). Until then, working with so much data it's better to use a database. They're already designed for it.
I don't know of any in the public domain. I thought I wrote one a while back, but it is still limited to 2^31. It occurs to me you couldn't even have the list/array implement Collection (since size() returns int). I might have to write this.
Imho, you design to the most abstract, theoretically sound vision, but you code to the job at hand. What I mean is, you shouldn't spend too much time worrying about problems that don't exist in the particular case you're dealing with. However, there's nothing wrong with making theoverall design flexible enough for future enhancements. For instance, define an abstract class and only do one implementation. Or, write a couple comments to the effect of /* this method can be overloaded to handle various InputStream types */ throughout your code. Also, don't just dump everything in "run()". Create the methods you'll need for your particular case, and have run call those methods. Want to reuse the code in the future? Add more specific methods and a case statement to run(). These are just examples, but that's how I'd approach the question. 
I disagree with "maybe programming isn't for you", but I agree that "It's not going to get easier". Same could be said with anything worth while like sports, relationships, etc. Read somewhere about a 10000 hour rule to proficiency
Disregard Swing Aquire [swt](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/)
Why do you want consumers of this code to be aware of the implementations of InputStream/OutputStream that are being used? That seems icky to me.
I do this sometimes, I think ahead and will widen the scope of a method call to deal with new scenario's in future work streams. It ends up taking longer and by the time the future work stream comes along there is no guarantee it will still be applicable. I think I'd agree it shouldn't take generic input until there is a requirement for it to do so. It only makes it more confusing to someone reading the code as to why it was made generic in the first place. 
Never used one but Mason looks interesting, let us know how you get on if you do end up using it. 
Shouldn't for (double i = dt; i &lt;= T; i += dt) actually be for (double i = dt; i &lt;= T; i += dt) { ie you've missed out the opening curly bracket. 
Thanks; that should do it.
That's what you get for not lining them up. ;)
I agree. I would take all the generics out and just use InputStream/OutputStream. 1. Using this class is more verbose than necessary because you have to define the types for IN and OUT. 2. Knowing the implementations goes the wrong way in terms of abstraction.
Always abstract to the highest level you can. In other words you are correct. "Program to an 'interface', not an 'implementation'." (Gang of Four 1995:18)
Who gives a shit? It doesn't really matter.
I assume the reviewer means for performance reasons? Because calling a method through a base class has a bit more overhead than calling it directly (and calling through an interface has a tiny bit more still). But if you're calling several kilobytes into a buffer a time in that run method (and you should be), the overhead of the method calls is too tiny to measure. It's definitely outweighed by the benefits of polymorphism. You are correct: You should leave it able to handle any InputStream and OuputStream (which is very easy to do), rather than arbitrarily restricting to specific stream subclasses. There is no need to make this generic though. What's with '`&lt;IN extends InputStream, OUT extends OutputStream&gt;`'? You can just use InputStream and OuputStream as the types and it will work the same. Also, from what you've shown of the code there's no reason for it to be a class. Wouldn't a simple method pipe(in, out) do? --- Edit: Here is how I would personally choose to implement a pipe method like this. It's there if you want it: /** Pipes in to out until EOF. Does not close either stream, so that more * data may be written to out, or mark()/reset() maybe used to rewind in. */ public static void pipe(InputStream in, OuputStream out) throws IOException { byte[] buf = new byte[4096]; for (;;) { int n = in.read(buf); if (n &lt; 0) break; out.write(buf, 0, n); } } --- Edit: And an example of how it may be used: /** Copies file src to dst. If dst exists and is a directory, src is copied into * the directory with its original file name. Otherwise, dst is used as the * file name directly. */ public static void copyFile(File src, File dst) throws IOException { if (dst.isDirectory()) dst = new File(dst, src.getName()); InputStream in = null; OutputStream out = null; try { in = new FileInputStream(src); out = new FileOutputStream(dst); pipe(in, out); } finally { if (in != null) in.close(); if (out != null) out.close(); } dst.setLastModified(src.lastModified()); } I hope this works right.
This is a partial screenshot from within eclipse. The results measured in ns are on the left in the console area. It's also interesting to note that the kernel takes a little longer the first time around. edit: should be not milliseconds, nanoseconds

Basically the problem with making your program more "Java-esque", which I assume would mean emphasizing quality factors and design principles aiming to make complex systems maintainable, is that your problem is not complex and the most likely best solution is to make the solution simple too. While it's generally a good approach to make the solution as simple as possible, I think it's acceptable to practice skills needed for complex system building by over-thinking the problem a little, possibly making the solution a bit more flexible than your simple requirements would imply. Your case of tic-tac-toe fits nicely in this approach, as basically any half-sensible solution would be good-enough from maintenance point of view, but a bit of over-engineering might give some insight how to approach more complex problems. First thing you could do to improve (ok, this is debatable, but anyway) your code is to make it more object oriented. Think what kind of building blocks your system actually uses, e.g. graphical (or textual) representation of the game board and rules engine. Think about the responsibilities of each building block, and try to divide different responsibilities to different components, e.g. view of the board, be it graphical or textual, is different responsibility from the logic of the game rules, altough both deal with the board. Getting input from the user to control the game logic is another good candidate to be separate responsibility. There is no single right way to divide the responsibilities, as it's always a trade-off between making things simple and making things flexible. Your actual requirements (or in case of exercise, also imaginary flexibility requirements) should dictate the design. trebor89 already gave you solid more hands-on type advice. I'd suggest you to think about those and write a second iteration of your program and post it for further comments. His advice about using enumerations is sound, but put it more in more general terms: think carefully about the data types within your system. Are the X's and O's really letters (i.e. one character strings) or are they more like arbitrary markers for two (or three including empty) different moves/players (constants preferably in enumeration context)? Should the board be a two-dimensional array or perhaps more abstract board object (which of course could use a two-dimensional array internally to store the pieces)? Are the co-ordinates integers or should/could they be abstracted (i.e. the Position class suggested by trebor89)?
