Use the find command. Or just plug y=0 into the equation. There's plenty of online resources on Matlab for you to look at for this.
Can you tell us what you've tried? This exercise is simple so it will be hard to guide you without giving the answer away.
Hey! So I just started this an intro to matlab course and I just finished the first assignment that asked super simple questions on how to separate a row or column of a matrix and then when I went to assignment 2 the difficulty just jumped extraordinarily! I have no clue what this question was asking me to begin with. Sorry if this problem was suppose to be simple, I have no background with coding or matlab
Try to work through the problem in steps. First, write down a line of code that calculates the distance between two 1x2 vectors. Then, try to think about how you can generalize that to the Mx2 and 1x2 vectors.
i like to write out comments of code first that describe what i need to do, then create the code underneath them step by step.
If you want a numeric answer- use numeric variables. MATLAB is terrible at doing symbolic math, and really good at doing numeric math. 
Seems to work now. Anyway,you are suggesting to not use something like "solve" command? I started using Matlab recently, I'm trying to figure out how to do it
It does work, but it works really slowly. For your case, I'm sure it still solves it basically instantly, so who cares. But it still is a bad habit to get into, because as you start using MATLAB to solve bigger, more complex problems, it will matter. There are optimization problems that take literal hours when done with a symbolic solver and seconds using numeric ones. For instance, you would want to use [`fzero`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html) instead of `solve` when you want a numeric solution. 
Ah, fzero should find the numerical solution while "solve", the symbolic ones? Thanks! I'm trying to understand fast how it works. Having few experiences, I'm trying to figure out the best solution for my simulations. With fzero I have to create the loop in the same way, in order to simulate a parametric equation? 
figure it out for yourself. Use the tic toc function 
I am more interested in qualitative differences than a number, tbh. Running speed was just an example; there might be some things I overlook.
Where did you find the course? I'm looking for an intro course myself
How would you do it with pencil and paper?
That's clever, I'm gonna try that
Hola. The code is written incorrectly! a+h=A Should be A = a + h; If you wish to assign the difference of **a-h** to **A**. The error is because Matlab's interpreter does not understand the statement you've written. It looks like you have the basis sorted out, however think about **f**. Is it a variable, an array, a matrix or something else? How do you plan on using it and accessing it with **a+h** and **a-h**?
f is just any function. One of the problems after creating the function is to use it to find the derivative of f(x)=cos(x/2)+sin(2x) over interval \[-pi, pi\]. For the function itself, I am trying to estimate the derivative f'(a) for f(x) at a point x=a.
So, one hint is that MATLAB (at least newer versions) will allow you to add/subtract a MxN matrices and Mx1 or 1xN vectors (i.e. if the length of the vector matches at least one dimension matches). It will automatically replicate the vector into a MxN matrix (making it so you're adding/ subtracting two like- sized matrices). 
I prefer to have the implementation in an `*.m` file because it plays much nicer with version control. It does have the drawback of having to update both the implementation and the wrapper code any time the interface changes.
So, first write out what you think the solution to the problem is WITHOUT code, just math on a pice of paper. Then, attempt to translate that to matlab code.
Are you trying to get the expression for the derivative? Or it's value? 
The value. What do you mean by "expression"?
Yes your function declaration is wrong, which is what he tried to help you with. To declare a function it look something like this: function outputs = function_name(inputs) Your errors are: 1. Your `df(a)` is incorrect. You just return the variable name (say `df`) not what it is a function of 2. You don't end a function declaration with a `;` 
Awesome! I tried that and it cleared things up. Thank you!
## I have tried like 5 different times on each question but I can't seem to figure it out. I keep trying to plug in numbers to FV (future value) = PV (present value)(1+r(ate of interest)\^T(time in years) but that isnt working. I think I might be supposed to use the Present value of Annuity on no. 10 but when I tried that it didnt work either. I don't know, I'm confused and stressed. Help would be appreciated!
pls help
In term of running speed, the impact should be minimal, if any. The way the ML function block is working (without getting in too much details) is to generate C code and compile it, and then run the compiled version. (without showing you the code. All of this happen behind the scene.) Having a ML function block which is just a wrapper around an existing m file should be "optimized out" by either the code generation or the compilation process. In term of what should you do, I would say that it's then a matter of personal choice. Most of the time I see people using the block just to call one function existing in a m-file. It's convenient because it means you can also use the code in ML without Simulink, you can use "regular" diff-ing tool. I tend to use the block as a "I call one existing function" most of the time as well, but occasionally I put a little bit of code inside. (If I need to call two existing function f1 and f2, I just call f1 and f2 in the block, I don't create a f3.m file that calls f1 and f2. Same if I need a few lines of logic, or if I need to illustrate a very small example)
The function that is the derivative, say cos(x) for sin(x) for example.
To be more soe ific, you should distinguish mathematical notation and computer implementation. For instance, y=f(x) in math, is a symbolic equivalence between y and the a function f with argument x. In programming y=f(x) is the storage into a memory variable of a number obtained by executing a function f with the argument x. Most of the time, both approaches are quite similar, but you must keep in mind that most of computer languages do not support symbolic equivalence. In your case, in Matlab, the syntax of a function definition is function result=f_name(arg1, arg2) The function is thus a piece of code that compute a value and store it in the variable result(using some arguments). So in the computer implementation, you loose the symbolic dependence of the obtained value to the arguments. 
Here's another idea: try scaling your T Matrix to the size of your S matrix. By subtracting and multiplying certain rows of your matrices you can get the euclidean distance as a matrix with the same size as S, which is readable line by line
I think the performance gain is negligible unless you're talking about very specific operations. &amp;#x200B; You're asking about function, but you should also consider clarity. It would be disingenuous to say that Simulink was designed to be the next, fastest, programming language. Simulink was designed to simulate dynamic systems and develop control systems. It takes design influences from some of the more visual aspects of control theory, which use block diagrams. &amp;#x200B; Another aspect to model based design is that it can be approached by people who are not familiar with writing or debugging code. Throw a 20 line m-function in front of a non-programmer and ask them to find a safety fault, and they'll quit in seconds. Put a model which has blocks, diagrams, and connections, and even non-programmers can understand what is going on to some level. One of the most important Pros of Simulink is that visual representation. When you write functionality into m, and use MATLAB function blocks, you risk loosing some of that clarity and approach-ability. &amp;#x200B; That being said, I've found that doing block-only is cumbersome for many problems. Math problems which require extensive use of math function blocks and understanding the order of operations may be much more compactly written in m than in Simulink blocks. An example from my own library is a block used to calculate the compressible flow of gas through an orifice. It is roughly \~12 lines of m, but \~50 blocks, organized into 5 subsystems. Things get worse if you have to deal with arrays and matrices with any size which is flexible before starting simulation, but fixed through simulation. The tools to graphically do index selection and assignment do not scale at all. My adaptive control library is written entirely in m, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. &amp;#x200B; Some rules I use: * Use blocks if the functionality exists to meet a safety requirement * Use blocks to generate boolean logic which controls switches * Use blocks to implement branching logic (if-else, function-calls, etc.) * Use m within a MATLAB function if external documentation is necessary to understand it * Use m within a MATLAB function if there is extensive use of matrix indexing or concatenating. 
Thanks man, this is what I was hoping for. This is similar to my considerations; an S-function is quite complicated; however a bock with a little code is understood quite easily (for example I wanted to calculate some pressures under a wave using linear potential theory). In blocks this would become an idiotic mess, however using a loop it is done in 5-6 lines of code. One thing that really bugs me about a matlab function block where you can write the code in it is that you have to provide the variables separately; using constant blocks. I didn't get it to use a struct. Do you by any chance know a way to have a function block in simulink pull a variable from the workspace rather that from a block? Or at least feed a struct in it (all my important values are stored in structs 4 structs so that would save me a lot of blocks; k, w, A and some other shit would be replaced by SEA, for example). 
This is a fairly typical paradigm in programming: make a class that has static properties or methods so that you can use those properties or methods without having to create an object (instance of the class). Classes are just cookie cutters for objects. If you don't want to have to have an object to use its class methods, static methods are for you. Your typical programming course has you create something like a "Car" class, that has various properties and methods, and is aimed at teaching you to make your own types of things in your program. These are easy to understand: I have a car, it has a model, a color, a top speed, a number of doors, and so on. It can accelerate, stop, turn, etc. You'd want instances of this class to distinguish a Pinto from a 911, with all the differences accounted for. Classes with static methods are more subtle. Let's say you make a class containing methods and/or properties that are suitable for use in your field. You could call the methods of the class directly, without needing an instance of the object the class defines. This is handy when you need a library of functions not typically accessible in the language. Instead of having to first define a `myClass = MyClass;` object, go through the constructor, set properties, what have you, then use its methods (e.g. `myClass.DoThing()`), you can simply call `MyClass.DoThing(args)` directly. In say, .NET, when you call anything related to the `System.Math` class, you're using things like `Math.Abs()` and `Math.Round()` without having to make a Math object instance first. Hope that helps.
This is a good answer. The only subtle clarification I'd make is, instead of thinking of it like: " If you don't want to have to have an object to use its class methods, static methods are for you." You might state this differently as: "If an instance of an object isn't necessary to define a method of a class". In the examples Math.Abs() and Math.Round(), there is no instance of anything required to define these operations. So, static methods can be useful when you want to associate/package up a given function within the context of a class where it would mainly be used, but you don't actually need an object constructed from that class to define that operation. &amp;#x200B; So, if you find yourself writing: &amp;#x200B; function self = myMethodName(self,args) %Your code end &amp;#x200B; And you don't actually need access to self (the instance of your class) in the definition, this is a good candidate to be a static method. &amp;#x200B; This is just a different way of saying the same thing, of course.
Instance methods are methods which require an object of the class to be created before they can be called. Static methods are methods that can be called without creating an object of the class. Say you had properties in the class (think a `Person` class with an `Age` property), you obviously can't access them in static methods as you don't have a reference to the object from which you would access its state (either member properties of other methods). Static methods are used for shared functions whose behavior is not dependent at all on class members (typically helper and utility functions). In fact you could have defined them as regular functions outside the class, it's just that static functions are scoped under the class name rather than globally. Example: classdef Person &lt; handle properties name age end methods function obj = Person(n, a) obj.name = n; obj.age = a; end function greet(obj) fprintf('hello %s, %d\n', obj.name, obj.age); end end methods (Static) function b = isAdult(age) b = age &gt;= 18; end end end Usage: obj = Person('alice', 22); obj.greet(); Person.isAdult(obj.age) As for the other types of **method attributes**, see the docs: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/method-attributes.html 
This is valuable (as is the other top-level comment at the time of writing this), because who knows for sure what explanation will give the most insight to OP (or anyone else who stops by)? Always good to have an alternative, if possible.
&gt; Do you by any chance know a way to have a function block in simulink pull a variable from the workspace rather that from a block? In the ML function block, if you have a function like [a,b] = some_function(c,d,e) And you want d and e to be parameter coming from the workspace, open the code from the block in the ML editor. In the toolstrip above the code, in one of the tabs, there should be a button "Edit data". Click on it. You should see a window listing a,b,c,d,e, and c,d,e being listed as inputs. Change from input to parameter for d and e, and now your block has only one input c, and will use the variable d and e from the workspace (they need to exist of course) It's explained there https://fr.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/parameter-arguments-in-matlab-function-block-functions.html but a screenshot would be easier, sorry I don't have one. On what TCoop said, I agree, you should use the best tool for a job. Simulink block (other than ML function) is very visual, and you should try to use this to show to other what you modelize. Use "normal" Simulink where you can, use ML function block if you have already some algorithm that you want to reuse or if the matlab code is more natural for that specific algorithm, and stateflow for state machines.
We have a winner, thank you very much. This saves me al LOT of stupid rectangles from some models. I was considering putting it in yet another subsystem, but this is way more elegant, thanks!
Happens to me sometimes , are you concatenating strings ? Or something like that ?
Sometime might be able to provide more insight if you shared some context about what you're trying to do.
Classic optimization problem, you need something like lsqnonlin.
If it’s string concatenation, give newline or char(10) a shot. That should hopefully give you a newline
Are you writing to a text-file and having the issue in that context? It's important to note that while Unix/Linux/Mac systems use \\n for a linefeed (LF) (as does Matlab's own interface and editor), windows and DOS use the combination \\r\\n (CR+LF). This creates the challenge that you may write out data to a text file, and have it open correctly in Matlab or notepad++, but in notepad it will show as a single long line of text.
Try ‘\r’ for carriage return
\n only gets interpreted as a new line within the sprintf and fprintf functions. If you're not using one of those functions, then you need to manually insert a new line. You can do this by concatenating the two parts together with the new line function. Try this: ['Line 1' newline 'Line 2']
You don't need to worry about that at all. Matlab interprets \n as whatever the appropriate combination of characters is for the OS you're using.
Alternative ways to create a namespace for functions: [Package](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html) Class with static methods
You don't need to worry about it for reading text files (or opening them in Matlab), but for writing them out it's something to be cognizant of. For example, I work with a code that outputs a common file-format in our industry which is just tabular columns of data. If I don't use CR-LF newlines, windows users will have problems opening these files in notepad or some windows applications.
The best way forward is to always be aware of the line ending conundrum. Because of different motives, UNIX has used the Line Feed as a new like character, while Windows uses Carriage Return + Line Feed. However, you can protect yourself against this pretty easily: 1. When you open a file for reading or writing text, open with the 't' modifier. For example, to open a new text file for writing: fid = fopen('my.txt', 'wt'); That makes sure you're writing the right type. 2. It's discouraged to use char(10) because it isn't platform aware. Instead, use the newline function (introduced in 2017a if I remember correctly). If you must use an earlier version, you could use ispc() and isunix() to figure out which line ending to use - or use sprintf. 3. Stay Consistent. Whichever method you use, the easiest way to get messed up is to switch halfway through.
Save the handle to the derivative as f_deriv not f_deriv(x). Basically you are trying to tell matlab to save the handle on position x which is symbolic variable
THANK YOU! I WISH I CAN GIVE YOU GOLD BUT HERE IS [REDDIT SILVER](https://i.imgur.com/2Dyrzet.png)
Why are you using symbolic variables? If you really need to use symbolic variables, why are you defining f as a function handle instead of a symbolic expression? Why do you define x_new if you're immediately going to overwrite x with x_new? Why have you written a sequence of iterations out by hand instead of using a loop? 
This makes no sense without context. Where did you type \n? Just in a string? In fprintf? In the console? 
I believe structured inputs into the MATLAB function have the same sort of limitations as buses into atomic subsystems. At the least, the bus can be virtual or non-virtual, but it must have a bus definition object in the workspace. &amp;#x200B; If you want the structure to come from a constant block, that has the same restrictions as generating a bus from a constant block. The bus definition needs to exist in the base workspace, the variable should be a structure which has the same layout as the bus, and the constant's output data type must be specified as a bus. &amp;#x200B; The official workflow documentation for how to implement structures with MATLAB function blocks can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/create-structures-in-matlab-function-blocks.html). &amp;#x200B; My personal style would be to still use a constant block, but just have it output a bus. Someone reviewing the model will be able to see where the parameters are coming from. I haven't tried using parameterized inputs like 2PetitsVerres is suggesting. The only thing I see as necessary would be a mask to set the parameters, but also show on the block what parameter is being used. 
You can solve to equation in a least squares sense. Write it in matrix form, and then pre multiple both sides by the transpose of the coefficient matrix to create a new system. This solution of the new system will be some version of optional for the given matrix.
In your loop code, you don't have an index (i) saving your new value to a spot in your W matrix. &amp;#x200B; Also, if W is n x n, your max() code written there will return a column vector with the max of each row.
Eh, I torrented and had no issues. If your not computer savvy then why are you using MATLAB in the first place??? But it's really just common sense, MATLAB needs at least 11 GB's to install on your C drive and you only have 1GB so obviously you're not able to install it. Duh.
Does this look better? s=10; for x=1:20 f=x^(2)-s; f_deriv=2.*x; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); x_new=x; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); x=x_new; end A3= save('A3.dat','x','-ascii'); 
I am getting an index error though Index exceeds array bounds.
&gt;Does this look better? &gt; &gt; s=10; &gt; for x=1:20 &gt; &gt; f=x^(2)-s; Okay so on the first iteration x is 1, so f is -9... &gt; f_deriv=2.*x; So far so good. This is the derivative of your expression, and since x is still 1, this sets f_deriv to 2, which is correct. &gt; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); OK. What do you think this means? On the first iteration it should be okay. x is 1, and both f and f_deriv have one element, so f(1) is going to give you -9 and f_deriv(1) is 2, so x_new is 1 - -9/2, or 5.5. &gt; x_new=x; Oh. Okay nevermind. Now x_new is 1 again because x is 1 and you just set x_new to the value of x. So what was the point of the previous line? &gt; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); Okay you changed it back to 5.5. So what was the point of the previous line? &gt; x=x_new; &gt; end Uuuh. Okay, x is the loop variable so I'm not sure this will even be allowed, but if so you set x to x_new, so now x is 5.5. Then we start the next loop iteration, with x set to 2. Kind of pointless to set it to 5.5 then, eh? Here we go... &gt; f=x^(2)-s; OK, x is 2 so f is -6. &gt; f_deriv=2.*x; x is 2 so f_deriv is 4. That's the correct value of the derivative. Looks okay... &gt; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); Okay now. x is 2, but f only has 1 element - its -6, remember two lines ago? And f_deriv also has just one element, 4 - from the last line, right? So what is f(2) and f_deriv(2)? You're asking for the second item on a list with only one item. That makes no sense, so you'll get an error here and the code execution ends. But even if it didn't end there, we have... &gt; A3= A3 equals... Equals what? Seems like you want to assign some value to a variable named A3, but you don't actually finish your sentence. That makes no sense so you'd get an error here (if execution hadn't already halted at the previous error). It seems like you weren't really thinking about what the code you wrote was doing. Try to figure out what steps you want to carry out, and write code to do those steps. 
I am assuming you are a student? If so, then you are likely getting the full version of MATLAB, which is WAY bigger than 1G. You are gonna have to find some space. &amp;#x200B; When I need space on my computer, I delete my old downloads and empty my trash. Might give that a go if you haven't already.
I have an external flash drive with 32G. My question was if I could install it entirely on that drive
Looks like it depends on what type of license you have: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/350052-installing-matlab-on-usb](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/350052-installing-matlab-on-usb)
I made it through undergrad (Physics) with just the basic educational license, no additional addons. You might email the professor and see if there are any toolboxes they recommend to make your life easier. These prices are from about 5 years ago, but I think the base package for me was something like $100, and the educational version with all the addons was $200. Alternatively, if you think you'll only need one or two addons, you can purchase them after the fact (I think they were around $30 for me).
When you get these types of problems, run each line sequentially, to find the line that's breaking the code. Then break down each side of the equal sign to see why it doesn't match. In this case, I believe it's your V(i,1)=max(W,\[\],2); line. The right hand sign I believe should return an entire vector, but the left hand side is just storing a single number. 
I never used a toolbox in undergrad. I used the image processing toolbox in grad school, but that's something your PI might pay for.
I had this issue when trying to install with limited space. Clean out your trash and such. Then only install the bare minimum Matlab without any add-ons. You can install the add-ons later. Matlab downloads the install files to the main drive then copy's them over to install so that is likely the issue. 
Great reply, but these are exactly the kinds of replies I get nervous I'm gonna get every time I post a MatLab question hahah Poor bloke's got some work to do.
Wow. I would have never thought this was a thing. Seems like trying to put a Ferrari engine in a VW bug chassis.
Yeah that's what I'd expect. Wouldn't you? Think about it. You're asking for the 2nd item on a list with only one item. If somebody did that to you, you'd tell them that the number of the item you asked for is bigger than the length of the list, right? 
Thank you I figured it out from your help! s=10; x=1; f=@(x) x^(2)-s; f_deriv=@(x) 2.*x; for n=1:20 x=x_new; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); end disp(x) A3=x; save('A3.dat','A3','-ascii');
Do you have Image Processing Toolbox? imfuse() will be helpful.
Probably the PDE toolbox. I’d go vanilla for now and add the licenses later if you need them. You could also look into alternatives such as python/numpy. 
&gt;Thank you I figured it out from your help! &gt; &gt; s=10; &gt; x=1; &gt; f=@(x) x^(2)-s; &gt; f_deriv=@(x) 2.*x; &gt; for n=1:20 &gt; x=x_new; &gt; x_new=x-f(x)./f_deriv(x); &gt; end &gt; &gt; disp(x) &gt; A3=x; &gt; &gt; save('A3.dat','A3','-ascii'); This will error because x_new is undefined before it is first used. Why does it exist anyway? 
Have you looked into the Hough Transform?
x_new is the new value for x. I do not get an error
You don't get an error because you have x_new already defined in your workspace as a result of your earlier attempts. I mean, *read the code you posted*. Where is x_new being defined? Is it before its used? What value would it have the first time you use it? If it's the new value of x, *why not just assign that value directly to x*? What is the reason for x_new to exist at all? 
If you have only one, fairly short video to analyze then doing it by hand will be faster.
Don't buy matlab if your major is FEA/FEM, that would be the wrong tool. Try to look for CFD products such as Converge CFD or AnSYS or any other product with flow solvers. They would also help you to proceed further in your career since these are specialized tools. If you are just going to use the FEM analysis and sparse linear algebra tools then you can pick any open source alternative and you basically buy nothing.
Try to look ahead at the courses you have to take and even talk to the professors. It cost me almost as much in addons after the fact. Here are a couple that I had to buy: - Data Acquisition Toolbox - Global Optimization Toolbox - Partial Differential Equation Toolbox - Simscape - Simscape Driveline - Simscape Fluids - Simscape Multibody - Simulink Control Design - Simulink Design Optimization It was $99.00 for the main license and $30 a piece for these addons. If I would have bought them when I bought the main license they would've been $10 a piece. 
Did you try running these operations in the console? That would show you what's going on. An interactive console is one of the major strengths of an interpreted language like Matlab. 
Try changing the renderer. Are you using export_fig from the file exchange? Makes that easy.
Thank you ! I didn't even know that this was possible. Setting the renderer to Zbuffer solved the problem for me. 
Good deal. If you aren’t using export_fig, I recommend it. Cheers!
Matlab's eps export has been weird with dashed lines for a while. Try: set(gcf,'Renderer','opengl') And then, how are you exporting to eps? I don't think that saving from the File menu of the figure has ever worked well. I've just used print('filename.eps', '-depsc') and there's a bunch of extra options such as setting the papersize. savefig was introduced in R2013 and has a few more options (I think)
Are you looking at the student licenses? They are usually $100 and come with the most important toolboxes.
[Annotations](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/annotation.html)
Well you can always convert numbers to strings with num2str. Annotations are great and flexible but text function itself is pretty pleasant for automated, in plot labeling. So, I would use text(x,y,[ ‘/leftarrow y = ‘ num2str(val)]); left arrow is optional of course, you can also use right,up or down arrows as well. Just check the documentation of “text”. 
I looked into dcmtk and also found a different tool. Posting in case it might help someone else. dcmtk offers the dicomnet.dll but is difficult to use in Matlab because you have to include the header file from the source. The dcmtk headers are numerous and cross-referencing. It would work with a lot of diligence to consolidate a suitable header, or maybe I just lack the knowledge to add them all properly to a path so it can find all appropriate headers by itself. This free utility below does the job of dicom push. Albeit, a second program to run outside of Matlab after processing the images. https://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=FileSender
 sprintf()
use the text function! https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/text.html?s_tid=doc_ta
You probably want to use [circshift](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/circshift.html).
What do you mean when you say rotate? What happens to the values that get pushed off the matrix? What should the values be that weren't previously on the matrix? **Can you provide an example output where the point of rotation isn't the center?** My gut reaction was some combination of `fliplr` and `flipud`, but that's all symmetric and not quite what I think you're after. Hard to visualize a rotation with a sample output. I'm assuming these rotations are always 90 degrees? 
A quick comment about your error checking - not to be rude, but it's ugly and repetitive and takes up a bunch of real estate relative to your actual code. Since you're not using `varargin`, you don't need to check `nargin` because matlab will error on its own if you don't supply the specified variables. The remainder of your code just checks if the inputs are empty and passes off to `er()` if it is, so you can make `er(varagin)` and check if(any(cellfun('isempty', varagin))) error("Insufficient input arguments") end Then all of your functions just pass their input values to er in the first line and continue processing. Your Fg function can still check/set a default value for G before running the error check. Regarding your question, I think everyone else here has it summed up pretty well; static methods let you essentially create a library of functions. You would use regular (instance) methods of you were going to create an instance of the class. You might make a "celestial body" object that has its own values for c, a, M, G, etc., and then you don't need to keep typing those values in because you can access them with self.____, because it's an internal property. Hope this helps! 
you never define the outputs in the function - left\_x and onwards are not set. I guess they might be part of the output of viscircles inside of the h structure. you also specify the img inside of the function so that will overwrite the input to the function in the first line. try; function h = eye\_detection()
This was an assignment at university, for our Multimedia course, which I became really invested in and developed beyond the specification. I'm really happy with the final product, so want to share it with the MATLAB community! :)
what you're looking at is a system of ODE's. using this search term will quickly lead to answers.
First, write this in matrix notation. Then you'll have some like x'=Mx and you can apply the algorithm, just vectorized 
I understand that matrix form is a way to do it, and I think I have to do that for the implicit method. But I don't understand how to do it using forward Euler on Matlab.
I tried this. All the videos use ODE45 though. It's because Euler's method is so relatively poor, it isn't really used so there's not much help on it.
Assuming you already have Jupiter notebook setup you then need to install [MATLAB API for Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html) and then install a MATLAB kernel for Jupiter such as [Calysto](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel)
Hi thanks for looking. I added `left_x = 100;` `right_x = 300;` `left_y = 50;` `right_y = 50;` to the end of the code. Should I specify the img outside the function? 
State space discretization wiki. They give an example for bilinear and I think forward Euler
How exactly are you using mean? Are you using it for the correct dimension? Why are you using mean? I would apply a high-pass filter and remove the blacks. 
I am no expert but suppose , if you have a Matrix 'M' then you access its values through subindexing with the colon operator . Store it in a variable , now plot your first 1k with the rest 99k M = [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ] a = M(1); x = M(2:10); % Subindexing with Colon operator plot(a); hold on % This command holds the figure window as active plot(x); Now the above plot might not be the coorect explanation to your problem , but its the concept , I am sure experts would clarify better! 
Plot the first k and average with the rest and average for that in diff colors for the lines but all on one plot? 
Mean is fine for image processing in the right circumstance, but it looks like you might want to look at the overall distribution of values more than the mean. That could be as simple as comparing the standard deviation of each block to the picture as a whole, or doing more complicated statistical tests. Anyways, it looks like your preprocessing steps already shifted the mean of the image, as you normally don’t have negative values in an image matrix. 
"good enough"? It will definitely give you the mean value of its input. Whether or not that's "good enough" really depends on whether the mean value is what you're looking for. 
Adopters are drivers for hardware based image acquisition (i.e. a camera plugged into your computer). That said, there is definitely a good way to load downloaded videos into MATLAB. (see VideoReader). If you tell us more about what exactly you are trying to do, it will be easier to help.
It is difficult to detect peaks without a proper definition of what you call a peak. Could you give us a plot of the data. Is that just a single value outlier, or a kind of noisy set of samples 1) single outlier. For instance you may look at the derivative to select samples Dy=diff(y)./diff(t) Dy(end+1)=Dy(end); % to have same nber of samples ii=find(abs(Dy) &gt;Dymax) ; y2=y; y2(ii) =(y(ii-1)+y(ii+1))/2; 2) multiple data makes the peaks I would use a low pass filter with filtfilt
I am trying to detect moving vehicles on roads for my clg project
Try to take a look at the help for function and see how it's used. Next look at help for imfindcircle. The reply you showed is wrong in every way. Use the help it's good and easy to use. 
Is it something like a pattern in the peaks you are looking for? Xcorr might be what you are looking for. 
Honestly I just assumed mean would give me the average value of the matrix of the image. however, upon testing a bit more does it only take the mean of the first column? The dimensions of the image is around 150x200. 
Are you doing this in real time with an actual camera, or from a video file?
You can try mean2 ([matlab page](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/mean2.html))? This seams to calculate the mean directly of an image (see the first example).
I would use edge detection with convolution. If the size of your images correspond with the size of your machine, you'll have saved a lot of time. This is because edge detection will leave only the edges of the image in their relative positions.
Oh thanks for this! I'll try it out
I'll look into this thanks!
No problem.
 save('array','X'); load('array'); where `X` is your array. That being said, it's usually better practice to have a main script and then call functions returning the objects you need.
The Matlab documentation is very helpful: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/function.html A two element vector is exactly what it sounds like. To define a row vector: x = [5 9]; or a column vector x = [5;9]; Then you access the elements with indexing, starting at 1. So in the above example, `x(1)` is equal to `5` and `x(2)` is equal to `9`.
Alright, I think I can understand what the elements in a vector represent. In the context of the function I mentioned, I'm creating an inline function right? There are two arguments inside of the function z. 
Two things: If you don't start your second script with "clear all" then the stuff your first script makes won't go away, and will be in your workspace still. Second, you should look into using functions instead of scripts for things like this. 
You can create an inline function at the bottom of your main script. Or you can create a function in a separate file. It's usually considered better practice to use separate files.
Actually i'm submitting the answer on Matlab Grader. I'm just desperately trying to understand this specific question. The previous questions had several variables as well that had explicit vectors and scalars that are the inputs. This function is confusing me because it has an input being x = \[x y\] instead of having the input y being separate vector or scalar.
I agree that the question is confusingly worded because it uses "x" as both a vector and an element of that vector. I think what it's asking is to use the input x = [x(1) x(2)].
How exactly does a two element vector get plugged into a function? How is it different from plugging a single element into each variable?
It is a function in a different file. Is that what you mean for using functions?
Yes. In that case I don't really understand your question. If you call the function, you can just return the array you want.
When you define a function, you generally don't have to specify the dimensions of the inputs. That behavior is determined at runtime when you call the function. So you could in principle pass any arbitrary input, except it might break down if those inputs aren't the ones you had in mind. In this case you could also have two scalar inputs, `x` and `y`. I'll try to illustrate the difference: function z1 = myfunc1(x) z = x(1) + 5*x(2) end function z = myfunc2(x,y) z = x + 5*y. Then you use the first one like this: x = [2;4]; z = myfunc1(x); The second one you use like this: x = 2; y = 4; z = myfunc2(x,y); 
t is on the left side of the third equation. This equation describe the change in speed over an increment of time (in second) as a function of g, the drag, the mass and the speed of the object a the previous timestep.
Video file
so, i would have to integrate that equation first, right?
This is a weird post to downvote. 
That's exactly what the documentation says it should do. 
Then you want to use a [VideoReader](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/videoreader.html) object. 
`polyfit` functions finds the coefficients of best-fit polynomial given a set of points. `polyval` is used to evaluate the polynomial, usually on a finer set of points. Example: % 10 points (sampled from the true model, a 1D sine wave) x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 10); y = sin(x); % fit a 7th degree polynomial p = polyfit(x, y, 7); % evaluate poly on a 100 equally spaced points xx = linspace(0, 4*pi, 100); yy = polyval(p, xx); % plot plot(x,y,'o', xx,yy,'-') legend({'input points', 'evaluated poly'}) 
Thanks a lot! This clears things up. 
For the case of a scalar times a vector/matrix, .\* and \* are equivalent. \&gt;&gt; 2\*\[1 3\] &amp;#x200B; ans = &amp;#x200B; 2 6 &amp;#x200B; \&gt;&gt; 2.\*\[1 3\] &amp;#x200B; ans = &amp;#x200B; 2 6
If you use the normal \* operator, Matlab assumes you want to do a traditional matrix multiplication, where you take the inner products of the rows of one matrix against the columns of another. Therefore, if you multiply two vectors together using \*, Matlab will report an error. For division (/), there is no "matrix division" that is defined, so any time you divide two vectors or matrices, they must be the same size, and you must use ./ . In your problem, the operations in the denominator result in a vector of results. There is no way to divide over a whole vector, but what you want is to divide over each element of the vector. None of this matters for scalars though. In your problem, mu is a scalar, so you can multiply mu by a vector or matrix using just \* with no problems. You could write .\* in your problem, and still get the same answer with no errors, but it would not be the correct code. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you so much! I fell so stupid right now...

You can read more information about array and matrix operations in [the documentation here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/array-vs-matrix-operations.html). Some relevant highlights: &gt; If one operand is a scalar and the other is not, then **MATLAB implicitly expands the scalar to be the same size as the other operand**. &gt; x = B/A is the solution to the equation xA = B. **Matrices A and B must have the same number of columns**. In terms of the left division operator, B/A = (A'\B')'. There is even more information about [what constitutes "compatible size" for arrays](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/compatible-array-sizes-for-basic-operations.html). There are also two matrix division operations defined in MATLAB, one of which is quite legendary for its one-size-fits-all approach to the solution of linear systems of equations. [Matrix right divide](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mrdivide.html) [Matrix left divide](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html) (the hero of our times... seriously, [check out the algorithms](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html#bt4jslc-6)). Hopefully this helps provide a bit more detail (and some corrections) to the answers already given in the comments here.
Thank you
This question comes up on a suspiciously yearly basis lol.
How about you just post your questions here, and then multiple people can see your questions and help you. 
Doesn't that work because the inner dimension of the matrices agree, your vector is 1x2. I would think it would fail if the matrix were a different size. Or maybe I have been using the element wise operator way more than I ever had to.
The quick and dirty way would be to use [eval](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eval.html). However, that's a bad way of doing things. A better way would be to put your data in a vector or cell array and then loop over the indices of that array. 
From your last figure, I think you can get pretty close to your desired result. I would look into segmenting this final binary image. You can do this using L=bwlabel(im); Here, L will be another image with integer values at each pixel that correspond to different connected segment of white pixels. Next, you would need to look for the largest connected segment and throw out the rest. You can do this using a for loop, or using hist() to identify the most common label value. In general this seems like a doable problem, depending on how much variation you see between different images.
check out cellfun() in combination with num2str() or something. i am struggling a bit to visualize what you want to do so if you're still stuck PM me some details and i can probably help more
So, this is a time I wish `eval` wasn't a function in MATLAB, because that is the way to do this, and of course there is always some exception to the rule to not use `eval` and so many people think they have a valid reason, but I'm telling you- if you're a novice to the point that you don't know about the `eval` function, it is almost 100% sure that you shouldn't use it. So, my question is- why is all of your data saved as different variables, instead of simply in an array (or cell array if necessary?) If they were in an array, you could simply loop through the array. If you don't understand how to do this, please ask and I'd much rather help you understand how to do it this way as opposed to helping you do what you asked. 
`fminsearch` will optimize a vector for you no problem. I don't actually see the code where you're calling `fminsearch` so I'm not sure how to help you. But as a rule, you can hand in a vectors `x0` and the output of `fminsearch` will be a vector of the same size of `x0`. However, remember that the function you hand to `fminsearch` should return the square of the error, not the vector you're optimizing over. 
Thanks man, I'll do what you suggested and then report back. Even if it is not perfect it's ok, teacher said it's not supposed to be a finished product :-)
UPDATE: 2 seconds after posting this I found out my problem, I put the period in-front of the incorrect operator. Anywho, as for the crash-course in vector stuff, I'd still like to get some tips/general knowledge about them. Thanks guys.
It does not work that way with adding and subtracting, as far as I know. My (not very elegant) way of dealing with this is writing: t = 1:10; q = ones(length(t)); y = (t-q).*(t+q); I just tried it in Matlab and apparently you can just add of subtract a scalar to or from a vector so t = 1:10; y = (t-1).*(t+1); works as well. &amp;#x200B;
That has nothing to do with addition and subtraction. Those are always element-wise operations. 
Yeah, just thought of it, thanks. Gonna make another coffee. Indeed, a vector times a scalar can work as well; the .+ has no added value, though, right?
The real solution here is to find the guy who named those variables and make him stop doing shit like that. This is what arrays are for. Cell arrays, in this case. Instead of myVar1, myVar2, etc. you should just have myVar{1}, myVar{2}, etc. Then you could iterate as usual. 
Yea I saw a lot of things online about avoiding using Eval. I’ll look more into arrays, thank you.
Thank you for the offer. I think I’ll be able to do it with the use of arrays though.
Indeed, the .+ command doesn't even exist. 
I am not totally versed in data types in MatLab, but I will absolutely look into arrays in future projects. Thank you so much! 
Hahaha guy found. Lesson learned after this thread. I will master arrays. Thank you for the help.
Yeah, thats what I meant; the existence of that command wouldn't be of any value, hence it was omitted. Or so I guess. I did not make matlab. &amp;#x200B; btw you are a true samaritan; I see lots of helpful comments (and correction of my sometimes drunk misexplanations of matlab) to your name. Keep it up!
I actually posted a comment yesterday that might help you, too. [Check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/aibwc3/when_do_i_need_element_wise_operators/eemr7nz/). It's in the context of multiplication and division of vectors and scalars, but the links are good for your use case as well. Best of luck, and come see us when you get stuck and can't find any help in the documentation! Bring your non-working code and any error messages you're getting, just like you did here and all will be well. :)
.mat is for data output (it's like .dat, but p sure it's formatted to be read only by Matlab). Your .m file will have your code, and it is readable by any text editor. I'm not sure if that's what you're asking, though.
where do i find this .m file? when i saved my matlab project, all it gave me was a .mat file
Your code should be saved in a .m file, probably in the directory that you were working from in Matlab
so i tried saving a test file, and my default is .mat, maybe thats why, but even when i tried to save it as a .m file, the code itself doesnt show up, like say example: z = 6 + 6 z = 12 all ill get from the .m file is z = 12 not the z = 6 + 6 portion
When you create a new script in the Editor and save the file it is saved to an .m file. If you write some commands in the command window and save from the workspace it'll save a .mat file of the variables generated by your code. Are you writing code in the editor? 
ohh, maybe that was the issue, ive been writing my code directly to the command window
Awesome thank you! I've been dreading this class for a while because people say it comes at you like a freight train with how fast the expect you to learn code. Glad to know I have a small support network on here. 
Have you done any programming before? MATLAB has some interesting quirks, but it's mostly similar to other C-like languages. One of the biggest and best differences is the extreme amount and high quality of the documentation. You can find pretty good examples and some fair documentation for things like C++ and JavaScript, but I have yet to see a language with anywhere near the cohesion and quality of documentation as MATLAB has. Microsoft is working on it for .NET with their docs.microsoft.com sites, but I still prefer MathWorks' flavor. I suspect you'll do just fine if you keep the [Help Browser](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/doc.html) open, and if you get stuck, there are lots of very helpful people here who will be happy to take you the last few steps on your mile-long journey. ;)
I am new to programming, pretty much no experience in any language. And thanks for the resource! 
You're most welcome.
This might be a non-elegant solution, but you might need to make new vectors with repeated values specifically for plotting. &amp;#x200B; if you have a 5x5 matrix that results in 25 unique solutions, your rows are repeated for each column value. Does that make sense? &amp;#x200B; If you have rows A and columns B, then your combinations are A1B1, A1B2, A1B3, A1B4, A1B5, A2B1, A2B2, etc... Make your X (rows) and Y (columns) and Z (solutions) line up in this way and you should be able to plot it easily.
Ya, that's the problem. Check out the command history though.
Don't have MATLAB in front of me right now, but something like the following should work fine: &amp;#x200B; `for i = 1:I` `for j = 1:J` `values(i,j) = function(Iparams(i),Jparams(j));` `end` `end` `surf(1:I,1:J,values)` &amp;#x200B;
 x = 0:10:1; y = 1:20; The slow, bad way: for i = 1:length(x) for j = 1:length(y) xx(i,j) = x(i); yy(i,j) = y(j); end end The fast, easier way: [xx, yy] = ndgrid(x, y); Then you can do your optimization cost = cost_function(xx, yy); You can also use `meshgrid(x, y)`, but it switches the output order and then is less consistent for more dimensions.
Theres a good chance you saved the workspace rather than the file. The .m file autosaves when it is run and is located in your working directory.
With the problem being identified (writing and executing from the command window) I would recommend always using the script editor. There is nothing to gain by using the command window and the editor saves your work and allows you to show your professor and any other interested parties exactly what you used to get your answer.
I'm actually not entirely sure what things like MIL and HIL mean, but we are developing high level controllers for the motor and cylinder. The motor is a maxon using an escon controller that I've configured to accept an analog signal between 0-10 volts to indicate current provided to the motor and returns feedback signals to the simulink machine. The pneumatic cylinder is controlled using solenoid valves that open/close the two chambers to a source pressure, with feedback coming directly from pressure sensors at the openings of the chambers. I did have another question, For I/O hardware, we currently have NI PCIe-6343 cards that we've been using for desktop real-time. I've gotten to the point where I've setup an external desktop to boot the real-time kernel over a direct ethernet connection from our development computer, but i'm a little bewildered by how to how to setup input/output blocks for simulink real-time. There doesn't seem to be a real-time input/output block and the desktop real-time blocks won't compile on an external machine. Do you have any advice where I might look to find the appropriate blocks to use on an external real-time machine? 
Because you've initialized `pf0` to have two rows (`n = length(pf)`), but have only put values into the first row.
Thank you, i know that i set pf0 to have two rows, the first for pf=1 and the second for pf =.8. But i'm getting only the answers when pf=.8 and zeros when pf =1
Your index says `pf(:,1)` not `pf(:,i)`
“Appdesigner” is *much* better than guide. Just FYI.
Do you want to get credit? Are you okay with the code being a textbook, or do you want a video of a teacher? A few more of these details might help narrow down suggestions.
Better use app designer now....
There is no "code" in a .mat file, only data. Code goes in .m files. 
What version of Matlab/Simulink are you running? Inside the Simulink library there is a section for SLRT blocks. As of R2018, they've eliminated much of the I/O blocks in favor of speedgoat hardware however if you stick with R2016 and prior, you should be able to find the supported NI hardware. https://imgur.com/a/8Fbx5qF

Go to the mathworks site and search for codi there are beginner game style tutorial for Matlab basics cool to learn Matlab 😉
I'm currently on 2018a, and also did it on 2017b thinking that the input/output might not have been depricated at that point. It seems that the data acquisition toolbox has blocks for the NI hardware, but I've read that it's not designed for real-time operation and may cause issues. would the real-time blocks be effectively the same as the desktop real-time blocks? would 2016b be an appropriate version of should I stick with 2016a? Sorry for the barrage of questions, but this all has been a little infuriating trying to figure this out over the last couple weeks.
Well, kind of to get credit, I guess. I'm starting a class in February and I just want to learn the program to know what I am doing and maybe have it a little easier later. Answering the second question - I am okay with any kind of material, really. My faculty is Electrical Engineering, in case this also helps in any way.
I will for sure give it a try. Thank You!

So, that's a 3D function- so you have a couple options. First, you can plot a 3D surface and then make the color your function value, or you could plot slices where you plot surfaces which are of the same functional value. What are you hoping do to?
Just so you don't get lost, it's actually called [Cody](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/about/cody/) (and it's linked in the sidebar). My favorite is the [Cody Challenge](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems?sort=&amp;term=group%3A%22Cody+Challenge%22). It helps you both practice beginner skills, and learn to optimize your code, pushing you toward more advanced techniques. Solving the problems the first time is mostly straightforward, but you can revisit them as many times as you like to apply new skills and get smaller and smaller answer sizes. Enjoy!
Sounds perfect. Thanks again!
You're welcome.
A "level surface" typically refers to the latter choice there. Like f(x, y, z) = 100 would give a sphere with radius 10. I think there are built in functions for plotting level curves of implicitly defined functions, but I haven't used them. 
SLRT and SLRT-Desktop aren't going to be the same. The hardware I/O drivers are different. I recommend using SLRT target in external mode so you get the Desktop feel but work on an I/O supported system. You can install both R2016b and R2018+. What I do is develop an I/O template in R2016b and open that with R2018+. This way I get the I/O blocks I need and then use the latest platform for development.
I run it on my Ubuntu laptop. They have a version native to linux. Never had any issues with it.
Clunky in what way? I use MATLAB on Linux and on Windows and they're relatively comparable for me.
Yeah, I’m hoping to plot a 3D-graph with different values like f(x,y,z) = 0, so the function is defined. I need to explain how such level surface would look like, and I was hoping to make a 3d-graph to make the results clearer.
&gt; plot(x, f(Y),'r') Dumb question, why are you using `f(Y)`? If I've understood your intent correctly, I'd have thought that `f(x)` would make more sense...
Can confirm. However, if you use shortcut keys as most coders do, take some time to familiarise yourself with the differences as they can be quite jarring. E.g., &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;c&gt; on Windows ends up as &lt;alt&gt;&lt;w&gt; on Linux (t least on Arch).
Yeah I changed all mine to windows shortcuts. Call me a casual or a less skilled developer, whatever haha
Same here. I did several courses worth of work and a Master's Thesis with MATLAB on a Linux machine, and never had any issues. If you're used to the Windows version, I'd suggest switching the keyboard shortcuts (Preferences-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Shortcuts-&gt;Active Settings-&gt;Windows Default Set). You also have to be careful of folder locations ("\\" vs "/") but using MATLAB "fullfile" can help avoid issues with that, since it will automatically use the right one.
FYI, you can also do MATLAB online: https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html 
+1 this
It runs great on linux! (and has for some time)
Heh, don't sell yourself short! I haven't even bothered to remap, so I just curse and revert to the mouse every time I try a shortcut on Linux.
I've never used octave-online, but I used octave for quite a while and never saw any major weaknesses in comparison to Matlab. The syntax has a few quirks (especially for plotting), and for very large datasets it can be slower, but it is generally very capable. I've never had a problem with Matlab on my own (xubuntu) Linux machine. My school has Arch machines, and I've had issues with plotting, but that may be specific to their installation. At the very least, I'd "upgrade" to putting an actual install of Octave on your Linux box. After that, try Matlab if you need it's features.
What is the value of u and t? If it's a constant, you need to define it... Ie t=5 If it's just random values within a range use the linspace function such that... T=linspace(min,max,number of intervals).. You can't just plot u and t if they are not definined. 
By random values I mean values with constant difference within a range
I have a lot of questions: What is `u(t)`? It's not defined. MATLAB doesn't know what it is unless you define it. `t` is probably time? But you haven't told MATLAB what times you're interested in. Do you want to plot zero to 1? Negative a million to 1 million? Without telling MATLAB, how will it know? To help, let me show you how you could do something similar. Say, you wanted to plot `f(t) = 2*x^2 - 3*(x-1)^2` when `x` was between -1 and 1. You would do something like this: x = linspace(-1,1,20); % make x a vector of 20 evenly spaced numbers between -1 and 1 y = 2*x.^2 - 3*(x-1).^2; % calculate your functional values plot(x,y); % plot y vs x 
You’re talking about the step function I assume. I believe MATLAB’s latest version uses the command “heavyside”. Here’s a link [MATLAB Heavyside function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/heaviside.html) 
I’ll assume u(t) is a unit step function and that I’m answering a homework question, right?
I've seen no difference whatsoever between Matlab on linux or windows (other than the editor key macros being set to Emacs by default), even all the hardware packages I've used work right out of the box.
Yes, but the function I originally defined was arbitrary and I'm probably going to be using u(t) functions in MATLAB, so I wanted to get experience with it beforehand.
u(t) is the unit step function as used in signal processing, Laplace transforms, etc. I wasn't able to Google anything that helped me with it.
Okay, so in that case, what is your MATLAB question? How to define the unit step function u(t) in MATLAB?
Yes, and then once that's defined, I'm assuming I plot it like I would anything else?
I've installed 2016b and notice that they do have blocks specifically for NI hardware, but it is by model number and it seems there aren't drivers for the model we're working with, do you know of any place to download extra drivers or otherwise figure out which block would be the best to use for our model? Thanks for all your help! 
Just a little side note, mat files are in an hdf5 format, so any h5 file viewer can look and edit them, though not as easily as doing it in MATLAB.
Would I just put x &gt; 2; x &lt;= 6??
Oh whoops this is the rest of the question! What matlab command do we use to get the element-by-element logical outcomes? *\[Note: the output should be a binary matrix of the same size\]* 
Wait I think I figured it out! Is it "x &gt; 2 &amp; x &lt;= 6"
When I inputted sum(y &gt; 2) I received an answer of "4!"
You can find the answer to this in Matlab's documentation very easily. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sum.html
this is most convenient, thank you! 
That is correct as 4 entries meat the criteria of being greater than 2. 
Not a lot more complicated than that, but outside of a `sum` function, just write `y &gt; 2` and note what you get. Notice you get an array of logical indices. So, next try `y(y &gt; 2)` and see what you get. See what to do now? 
So how do you write the step function by hand? 
u(t)? I'm not sure of anything else it could be.
It's been a while since I compared, but if I remember correctly it's significantly faster to use sum() instead of numel().
Then how would you know what the value of the function is for a given t? Surely there was a time in your life when you hadn't heard of the step function before, and somebody had to define it for you? 
Use “%.1f” instead of “%d”
For a unit step function, u(t) becomes 1 at some event. So by this should I be using x = (4 - 6*(t - 5))
&gt;str = sprintf(formatSpec,A1,A2,A3,A4) It worked! Thank you!
"at some event" Yes. And that event is...? Maybe when t &gt; 0?
I tried entering "x = input( prompt )," but it's telling me (Undefined function or variable 'prompt')
Damn it was that... Thanks a lot!
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/input.html From the side bar: The effort you put into asking a question is often matched by the quality of our answers. http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro
Right. So how do I code that in MATLAB though?
How would you write it on paper? 
x = 4u(t) - 6u(t-5), t &gt; 0 
Have you tried either of those ideas yet? 
I'm guessing you haven't defined a variable called "prompt". 
&gt; NI PCIe-6343 I don't see any drivers for this. Sorry.
When you do "Save Workspace", it just saves all the variables you have created into a .mat file. This is very useful if you are working with a large dataset, and would like to save it for later processing, but it is not what you want for saving a script of code.
Well 90% of what I wrote still applies. Also, did you try to Google "step function Matlab"? If you did, you would be lead [here] (https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/heaviside.html) which might help you. 
Trapezoidal integration is very simple in Matlab. Come up with the formula for the area of a trapezoid, evaluate the function at a fixed interval (the width of your trapezoid) for the bases and heights of the trapezoid, and add up all the areas to give you the integral. The “base” of your trapezoid should be the height of the next. The built in function trapz is another option as it does everything for you.
Yo I discarded this method and went ahead with the BRISK. I'm now getting some outputs but they're not entirely accurate (like 30% success rate.) I'm however applying certain filters before I implement BRISK, is there any particular order that I should filter the image in? Or can I choose that randomly? My current filter list looks like this: `bw = rgb2gray(img); %black and white conversion` `%filters start` `guassian = imgaussfilt(bw,2.5); % create the gaussian filter with sigma = 2.5` `edge = [-1 0 1; -2 0 2; -1 0 1]; %edge detection` `sobel = imfilter(guassian, edge);` `sharp = imsharpen(sobel); %sharpen image` `%contrast = imadjust(sharp); %contrast increase` `contrast = adapthisteq(sharp);` `%filters end` --- Can you please offer suggestions?
“Prompt” is a string. Its literally the question you want to appear when you run the code.
Oops sorry here's the code (only the filters part): `guassian = imgaussfilt(bw,2.5); % create the gaussian filter with sigma = 2.5` `edge = [-1 0 1; -2 0 2; -1 0 1]; %edge detection` `sobel = imfilter(guassian, edge);` `sharp = imsharpen(sobel); %sharpen image` `%contrast = imadjust(sharp); %contrast increase` `contrast = adapthisteq(sharp);` --- and then I pass 'contrast' in the BRISK statement.
Here a nice course for beginners. For free. Nicely illustrated. [http://studybyyourself.com/seminar/linear-algebra/course/?lang=en](http://studybyyourself.com/seminar/linear-algebra/course/?lang=en).
it would be “x&gt;2 &amp;&amp; x&lt;=6”. 
As the error tells you, your array indices need to be positive numbers or booleans. Yours aren’t either of these at the moment
On the first line in the loop you are trying to access an index in variable ‘a’. The index is the exponent which most likely will not turn out to be an integer. This is why you get the error. 
This is the best answer.
Yeah. Second line of door loop, replace the parentheses after the a with a ". *" A is a constant and yet you are asking for an index as if it were an array by virtue of parentheses following the a
Mix up the order and see what your success rate is?
I don't really understand what formula you're doing here. 3 values averaged by the range of each value in the vector-- what does this actually mean?
Well getting the 2.5, 3, and 3.5 would essentially just be linspace(2,4,5). And the 4:5 set would be linspace(4,5,5).
Yep, this is the command I was looking, completely fell out of my head. Thank-you! My plan was to apply it to a much larger vector via a script, but that's all I needed. 
The shortcuts are based on emacs (and bash) shortcuts. However, as an emacs user, they are poorly implemented and SUPER FRUSTRATING ... so, even a diehard emacs user (me) sets theirs to CTRL+C, CTRL+V. (However, most of the time I deal with matlab, I'm doing it from inside emacs and avoid the GUI as much as possible.)
The only thing I ever really ran into was some interacting with test equipment. And this is really only due to the fact that the VISA driver for some of the HP/Keysight/Agilent stuff was windows only.
I would use interp1
Ah, thank-you! This makes it a lot more easier. 
This was actually from a couple months ago but I shared a program that I wrote with their social media account and they sent me this.
As an addition to the other comments, you don’t really need a for loop there. You can do the calculation as matrix operations. 
I had no idea you could integrate MATLAB into emacs! MATLAB is so easy &amp; ubiquitous in the sciences that it's fairly unavoidable...but I prefer C/Python for most tasks. I've always used separate IDEs, but I'd love to integrate all 3 into one environment. Any tips or advice?
https://blogs.mathworks.com/community/2009/09/14/matlab-emacs-integration-is-back/ I think following that is all you need to do. Then run 'matlab-shell' to get a shell (no gui!!), and I find my code, highlight a region and hit C-c C-r to send it to the shell. It can pull up any gui window you want (figures, tools, documentation, etc.) and its much faster than desktop version. The only problem I've found (I've been moving to python more and more) is nuances between the modes. I just need to unify the commands to a) send to an interpreter, b) comment a region, c) start a shell / compile [c mode] and manage breakpoints. However, that's on me for not tweaking the .emacs files. I'm using the conda distributions for python, and on my linux box (rhel 7.5) it worked out of the box for me.
Look up string concatenation in general, and in Matlab. One example is horzcat, but there are many ways to do it. 
You've only told it to display `'N = '`. You need to actually put the value of `N` there. You'll want to concatenate the label and value together using one of the methods available (either [strcat](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/strcat.html) or array-building (ex. `['thing1 ', 'thing2']` would work).
Great, thanks!
Just so it’s clear. I have no problem helping answer hw questions. However, You’ve put literally zero effort into solving this problem yourself.
Another neat function that handles string formatting is [sprintf](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html). Perhaps not as straightforward as the functions mentioned above.
Hi, that's what i figured. So would you say that short of writing custom drivers, this hardware configuration is a a no-go for running a control loop in real-time? We're starting to look into using a beaglebone and seeing if we can eek out the performance we need, but i'm still not entirely sure if it can even be operated in a hard real-time manner using mathworks interfacing add-ons and simulink coder. This is all so confusing, thanks for all your help! 
Hope it helps!
I tried about 5 to 6 combinations and I'm still not getting any better.
Well there's your answer.
In case of any Filter Design, we assume no gain (0 dB or 1) in the passband. So any Filter you design in MATLAB won't get gain. You can however define delta tolerance or ripples in the pass band. Please excuse if I am wrong, as I also just began working on these things recently 
That's sort of been my assumption with filters before but this class I'm in (this is the first assignment) seems to think differently. Haha. I'm going to add a tiny snippet of the specs straight off the page to the bottom of the post. 
I may be on to something right now. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/firpmord.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/firpmord.html)
This seems to be working. I just have to make sure everything else is good outside of the passband and I guess maybe this works. Will update if it does. [https://imgur.com/a/KnNaze4](https://imgur.com/a/KnNaze4)
[https://imgur.com/a/3NpnvHl](https://imgur.com/a/3NpnvHl)
See the dB scale.... 
It is a very cost-efficient way.
image processing tool kit, plot array as points?
You have two points marked because you defined NearPoint not as a single point but you gave it two Y coordinates, while A defines two X coordinates. you should define NearPoint\_X, and NearPoint\_Y, and then plot it.
Yup, just reference NearPoint(1) as your x-coordinate and NearPoint(2) as your y-coordinate
Respectfully, I disagree that this is “the best answer .” As a helpful function for someone who a) can write code and b) understands MATLAB specifically, sure. But, for this person, the exercise as a homework question was learning basic MATLAB concepts including what a function is and basic control flow. Being given the unit step function directly makes this problem too easy and isn’t teaching some valuable concepts.
That’s fair. I wasn’t really considering the context of the question. 
It’s cool. I went to school pre stackoverflow, pre reddit, so I’m probably unreasonably annoyed by stuff like this.
This is a builtin image. Enter 'spy' in console.
You're onto something with `[b, d]`. What if you also added a `', '` there? Array-building concatenation is one possible route among several. Another is using some of the direct concatenation tools like [`horzcat`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/horzcat.html) or [`strcat`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/strcat.html). You could also look into [`sprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html), but it might be a bit much for something this simple.
Well, I’ll be darn. I had no idea this even existed and I’ve been using Matlab for over 20 years. 
Practice makes perfect. I'd recommend trying out [Cody](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/about/cody/), and in particular, the [Cody Challenge](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems?sort=&amp;term=group%3A%22Cody+Challenge%22). Keep [the documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/) handy, and you will improve steadily. After some time, you can revisit your old solutions to improve your score (by creating more compact solutions), which will push your skills even further. Best of luck!
First, define 'closest'. Set that value in a tolerance variable. tol = myInteger/100; % or whatever Next, find the [absolute distance](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/abs.html) from your integer to elements in your vector. absDist = abs(A - myInteger); Finally, compare to your tolerance to [find the indices](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/find.html). [row, col] = find(absDist &lt; tol); Once you've done that to see how it works, make a one-liner for bonus cool points. Tune as needed.
I would proceed in a different way. I cannot provide code since I do not have Matlab bearby: 1) make a vector of unique value [y, i, j] =unique(x) ; Here you have to look at the doc but you have y=x(i) or x=y(I) I don't remember well, you have to check. Basicallt either i or j give you the correspondance between the original x and the sorted unique y. I will use I in the later. 2) compute the difference between 4 consecutive values m=4; dy=y(m:end) - y(1:end-m); 3) look for the minimum and note the position [dymin, imin] = min(dy) ; Here you know that the m numbers you look for are located in y at index imin,..., imin+m 4) recover the original position in x using i Idx=i(imin:imin+m) ; You should check that x(Idx) is equal to y(imin:imin+m), if not use j instead of i. Sorry for not being accurate, but I guess the structure of the prog is correct
The loop you have there is plotting point by point, it won't plot a line. Save you X's and Y's in a vector and then plot it all after the loop runs.
Ah okay, so make a vector with the x and y values, and the plot the vector? 
At work i like to play minesweeper as there is a veraiin built into matlab. xpbombs i think it is called. You can also mod it if you wanted.
It would be better to ask in /r/learnpython. To specify the axis, you can do `np.fft.fft(xs0['xs'], axis=1)`. Your case works because it is a 2D array and numpy defaults to doing the FFT along the last axis. The reason `np.fft.fft` works while `np.fft.fft2` does't is because `fft2` does 2D fft. This is a fundamentally different operation than what you want, which is a 1D FFT repeated ("broadcast") along a particular dimension. 
I can guarantee all elements of A are already unique it may simply be 100.1 and 100.09. But I suppose I could do a floor of each element and then cross reference the unique ones. I can try that tomorrow.
The tolerance changes across different data sets and I would like this to be automated for batch processing.
https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/296djj/when_matlab_and_reddit_collide_run_this_code
Where/when do d you go to school?
&gt; ...there are many integers not just one. I guess I could do a linspace to produce the integers between min(A) max(A) You may be interested in the [`unique`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/unique.html) function. Used in conjunction with [`round`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/round.html) you could *probably* pick the correct integers. Taking the `min` and `max` of `A` would allow you to use `round(min(A)):round(max(A))` to generate the initial set, too. In case you weren't aware, there are also [`floor`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/floor.html) and [`ceil`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ceil.html) functions to make rounding lean one way or the other. &gt; ...I am trying to avoid a loop. &gt; ...I would like this to be automated for batch processing... Pick one! Even if you're going to provide a code-friendly manifest for each batch, you'll be looping through files at minimum. You can probably avoid a loop in the algorithm itself using some combination of the advice you've gotten here, plus or minus some of your own ingenuity. &gt; The tolerance changes across different data sets No problem. As I defined it, it would be based on a given integer value anyway. The world is your oyster.
Undergrad: late 90s Virginia Tech.
Correct. Matlab actually plots those points as line objects, but as they are only points they are very difficult to distinguish visually. 
Great! I will use a loop if I must. It makes sense in this context. I may also just interp1 to force it. Let you know Monday if it works. 
Thanks! It ended up being due yesterday. My makeshift resolution was to make two different text code lines, one for x and one for y, with a larger displacement x value on the y to make the space more apparent. I tried all sorts of combinations for commas and spaces and nothing would work. Ill definitely keep this in mind for future assignments, though. Thank you!
If I understand your question correctly the thing you are asking for could be solved by using directional statistics. [Here](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10676-circular-statistics-toolbox-directional-statistics) is a nice file exchange contribution. At least this lets you directly calculate the directional mean/center. 
You're most welcome. Best of luck!
I use fractions. Like cubic root of X is X\^(1/3).
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** BiggPea! ^(hug)
If its a standalone function you can’t really run it, you gotta use it in the command window or in another script
Oh yeah, I just realized the professor uploaded a script to test the functions with along with the assignment. Obviously, I'm just dumb. Thank you!
Unique is a built in function, you don't have to worry about that.. If you want clean code, try not doing floors since the algorithm will be data specific. The purpose of unique is not really to get unique values, but to get the two indexes array I and j that describes how both x and y relates together 
Have u tried restarting MATLAB or your computer?? (No joke, worked for me)
Haven’t tried restarting PC yet, I will try tomorrow, thanks!
There's some problems with your if statements. They need to be if info == number. Try stepping through the code line by line to see if the lable are correct and then end up getting changed by something later in the script.

I think a 'simple' analytical solution will be difficult to obtain due to the structure of the equation. Did you have any assumptions on some of the parameters, it can helps sometimes the solver to further simplify the conditions... Otherwise you may go for a numerical root solver... 
It may be of little use to you here, but whenever I have complicated equations like this, I always create variables to substitute as function “pieces”. As a simple example: 2x = (700x^3*d/dx(10xy))/((27xy)^1/3) can be written in MATLAB as 2x = (a*b)/c where a = 700x^3 b = d/dx(10xy) c = (27xy)^1/3 You probably already know this, but it’s just a reminder and does help a lot when trying to use MATLAB to solve equations. 
Basically, the doc has several nice demos which are enough to master all the basics. I would suggest using the latest release since it has some nice features such as the capability to define your own layer. 
I'm pretty sure you have to use some solver like the Newton's one (or euler's), because Matlab has to start with a value of P2 and then calculate it iteratively. There are different way to solve it, based on the precision you need. Try to take a look at them
I used your idea as inspiration and just plotted the left side and right side of the equation separately with p2 being “x”, and found where they intercept. And added some extra code to output that value. So thank you, that helped
Glad to help my friend! If you have time, Don t you mind to post the script? Just curios :) 
[https://imgur.com/PnC0GFt](https://imgur.com/PnC0GFt) I'm not very good with paint. I kind of MacGyver'd the code. I subtracted the left side of the equation from the right to make the value I want cross the x-axis of the plot. Then I absolute valued it so I could use the 'min' function to find the value I needed. Then the last two lines just display what that x-value is, which was my P2. I'm sure there is a way easier way to do it, but this made sense to me
Well, seems working! :) 
Does 2015 works??
I don't think so. If you want something free in deep learning, you should go for python with a good library such as pytorch or tensorflow. They are free, up to date reaseach project source code are available. There are plenty of tutorial and ressources. Matlab can do deep learning but it is not up to date. It is quite difficult to modify the code, even if the latest release allows définingcusto layers. It misses auto differentition feature the possibility to easily rewrite criterion. So if you want basic things and deep learning is not the main focus, then Matlab is an option. For more deepnlearning centered project, switch to python. 
I’m still having some issues. I removed the plot function out of the loop, and within the loop added: dv=[x;y]. After the loop I added plot(dv). As it didn’t work, I assume that’s not quite what you meant 
you need to understand one thing. MATLAB is **magic**.
You're overwriting the value of `dv` on every iteration of the loop. You need to employ [indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html) instead.
scatter3(X,Y,Z)
If your intention is to split the plot into 2 (or more) categories (vs a 3 dimensional plot as /u/Pb_Walrus suggested), I would suggest [logical indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/array-indexing.html#d120e1410). For your example, you could produce all the green circles with a single plot command: Figure (1); scatter(x(z == 1), y(z==1), 'og'); 
Not necessarily the best option, depending on some of the specifics of what you want out of this, but you can try: `scatter(x,y,[], state);` If you `help scatter` you'll see that the function can be called with four inputs (`x,y,sz,c`), where the final one represents the values used to scale the colour. By calling the function with empty brackets for the `sz` input, the default values are used for `sz` (the size of the markers) while still allowing you to input the state values to affect colour.
I receive the error, ‘vectors must be the same length’. As far I can tell, they are the same length?
What are the inputs OP?
I managed to solve it but here they are anyway. t0 - time initial tf - time final y0 - value of y at t0 (y is a function of t) h - separation between intervals of t The issue was that T and Y were different sizes, I fixed it by changing for j=1:n to j=1:n-1
I have figured it out. It looks like your for loop iterations exceed the size of matrix Y in the statement `for j=1:n` `Y(j+1)=Y(j)+h*f(T(j));` `end` You are telling function to create an additional element in Y with the j+1 since your loop iterations is already exactly your matrix Y size. The best way to fix this and reduce the number of lines in your code is as such, `for j=1:length(Y)-1` `Y(j+1)=Y(j)+h*f(T(j));` `end` This removes the use of numel and produces the matrix you want.
thank you !
Okay. What's the question? 
Why does Matlab always return a -sin term for the set of solutions to a homogeneous case? It's not a huge deal in this case but with a more complicated RHS and IVPs it ruins the solution.
Isn't that equivalent to a sign change in the coefficient? It shouldn't ruin anything unless you're making assumptions about signs that you can't really justify. 
Everything seems to be in order. Computer algebra systems won't necessarily do things the same way a person would when it comes to simplifying equations and such. Nothing is wrong mathematically, since C2 is just an arbitrary constant, and so is -C2. Those don't take on values until you specify the initial conditions and you will get the right answer regardless, just in one case the thing you call C2 will have opposite sign (your C2 = negative the thing MATLAB calls C2). If by complex roots you're referring to a characteristic equation for the ODE, my best guess is that there were two i's that got multiplied to give -1 somewhere along the way. Since nothing changes when you call simplify, it looks like combining minus signs and coefficients isn't one of the things it does. I've only used the symbolic functionality a handful of times. It usually gets me most of the way there, but I always have to do a bit of cleanup afterwards. It basically just saves me some algebra work and can also verify I didn't make a mistake doing things by hand. To be sure, you can add some initial conditions, check the plot, and verify by hand that it's correct. \--- clear; close all; clc; syms y(x); Dy = diff(y); ode = diff(y,x,2) + y == x; ySol(x) = dsolve(ode) ySol = simplify(ySol) % Try some initial conditions cond1 = y(0) == -4; cond2 = Dy(0) == 12; ySolSpecific(x) = dsolve(ode, \[cond1 cond2\]) ezplot(ySolSpecific, \[-10 10\]) \---
If you have the option to pick a topic then picking something you're interested in will be best. If you're interested in the topic it will be more fun and you'll be more motivated to do the project, which will generally produce a better result.
First answer - this is not an ideal implementation. \*Everything\* in MATLAB is faster when you can do it without loops (rather, when you have things vectorized). That's not to say that avoiding loops will always be possible, but loops combined with plotting can be extremely slow, especially for larger data sets. &amp;#x200B; One way to make this idea more efficient would be to loop over the state variable, rather than the rows of data. This would be more efficient since there are fewer states than data points. &amp;#x200B; states = 1; % (or whatever the highest number is). for state = 0:states idx = (data(:,3) == state); scatter(x(idx), y(idx),...) end &amp;#x200B; That's just general advice. For this specific example: gscatter is built for this, with the bonus that the group variable need not be numeric. Here's a minimal example: \--- % Make some data data= randn(5,2); % Assign to groups grps = {'a';'b';'b';'a';'c'}; % Plot data, colored by group gscatter(data(:,1), data(:,2), grps); \--- You can pass additional arguments defining the style for each group (e.g., marker type, color, etc.). See the documentation for more. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/gscatter.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/gscatter.html) &amp;#x200B;
I don't know what topics should I correlate and where to get the necessary datasets, hence I was crowdsourcing here -- maybe it could spark interest 
Not really making assumptions, just wondering why Matlab doesn't follow normal sign conventions. Symbolab and Wolfram appear to solve ODE just fine, but Matlab decides to be weird.
I started doing GUI's awhile ago - started with someone else's code and eventually worked it into my own kind of template. I don't think I have time to debug your example, but feel free to borrow anything from this script that might be helpful: [http://ronzor.net/other/SystemExplorer.m](http://ronzor.net/other/SystemExplorer.m) The link should download a file called SystemExplorer.m ( 8kb, 193 lines)
Yeah, just wondering where Matlab gets the (-) from. Seems weird that of the solvers I've used Matlab is the only one to do it that way. The assignment was to solve by hand and verify using software of our choice, so I wanted to be able to justify Matlab's solution.
I'm not familiar with the algorithms used for symbolic DE solving but I suspect there's no guaranteed way to ensure a consistent convention. Really, symbolic manipulation is not a major focus of Matlab, so if you care about details like this you're better off with Mathematica or something like that. If you're using Matlab, it's almost always because you're looking for numerical results, so obviously you wouldn't use symbols at all. 
Don't check for strict equality. Try defining a very small number, I'll call it z, and instead of checking if x=y, check if |x-y| &lt; z. Alternatively, you can round all of your answers to some fixed precision, like 4 decimals, and then check for equality. One other note: if x and y are vectors of length n, then the comparison y==x returns another vector of length n with the pairwise comparisons. Might be ok here - but be aware of that in the future as it can potentially cause problems. Whenever I mean to compare two vectors and get a single answer, I use 'all', e.g. if all(y==x) ...
p.s. as a simple example of how easy it is to fool computers, try entering the following into the MATLAB command line: `(1/2+2/3-7/6)==0` The problem is the division and how numbers are stored internally. Gaussian elimination tends to involve many divisions, so there's ample opportunities for subtle errors to creep in. For the future, try to keep that in mind and whenever possible, save division for last. For example, if I just rewrite the above equation as `(3+4-7)/6` then MATLAB now correctly tells me the answer is zero.
&gt;The assignment was to solve by hand and verify using software of our choice, so I wanted to be able to justify Matlab's solution. And that's exactly what you have done. A sign change on an arbitrary constant is easily justifiable. It's the exact same solution you'd arrive at in any other way. If anything, the lesson your instructor wants you to learn is that these are equivalent ways of writing the same expression. 
I understand what you're saying - but I want to stress that there is no difference between your solution and MATLAB. -C2 just means "some real number which we'll call minus C2 for now", to be determined by the initial conditions. You did verify that you both have the same solutions, since you are both saying "some real number" times sin(x). As far as the exact steps the algorithm is taking to produce the minus sign, like I said, it probably has to do with i*i=-1 showing up at some point. I understand that something like, WolframAlpha, does not produce the same minus sign. This is probably because their algorithm is a bit more sophisticated and does things like absorb minus signs into coefficients. Writing an algorithm to symbolically solve equations is no easy task, so it shouldn't be surprising that different software written by different authors will follow different approaches and present solutions in different (but equivalent) forms. One thing that might not be clear is that MATLAB also stores those coefficients internally, and if you were solving a system of ODEs for example, you might see C2 show up in a few different places. The important part there is that C2 always refers to the same constant. Having a minus sign in front of it is not meaningful unless, for example, you had both C2 and -C2 in the same solution. Is this making sense?
p.s. If you are really set on tracking down the origin of that minus sign - look for it when you solve by hand. Maybe it canceled out along the way. If you don't see anything, then MATLAB might not be using the same method you did, and the answer is probably buried somewhere in the dsolve code (which you can read if you so desire. Highlight dsolve and click 'open'). You could also head over to the mathworks forums and ask someone over there. Chances are someone knows the inner workings of the algorithm but be prepared for some potentially VERY high level math.
Are you just telling us? Or do you have a question? Because, there is no question here. 
Oh sorry - just edited it to be more clear.
We're not going to tell you "how to write code". Please read [our rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/) to help understand how to ask a proper question. 
Note that you only need to search from 2 to sqrt(number in question) because after sqrt(num), you would have already found the other factor &amp;#x200B; Try checking to see if there is a remainder after division (look at "rem" function) &amp;#x200B; If there is no remainder, "continue" to the top of the loop to check next number, there is &amp;#x200B; if you make it to the end of loop...then you have a prime, append it to a list &amp;#x200B; I'd start by making the double-loop version (i=1...n and 2...sqrt(i), then consider ways to do it faster with arrays/vectors) &amp;#x200B;
Use nested for-loops and the modulo operator.
* that "continue" might need to be a "break" out of inner loop along with logic to check if you made it through entire inner loop (which would be a prime) or called "break" (not a prime)
Try incrementing i by 1 instead of 3
A general approach to this problem M=4; N=5; for i=1:N subplot(N, M, (i-1)*M+1); subplot(N, M, (i-1)*M+2); subplot(N, M, (i-1)*M+3); .... subplot(N, M, (i-1)*M+M); End; You just have to adapt n and m
Why not trying to find the relation between weather factors (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.) and electricity consumed. I easily found some open data set. For my re ion, I belive that Co ld be extended to other country/region. The main issue is that the measurements are not likely to be sampled at the same rate, so you will have to pré process the data a little before playing with them
It's pretty easy to come up with a function of i for each of those values. 
Are you looking for this: subplot(2,3,(i-1)*3+1) subplot(2,3,(i-1)*3+2) subplot(2,3,(i-1)*3+3) Which can be further embedded in another loop if you want: for j=1:3 subplot(2,3,(i-1)*3+j) end &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for your help, this was very useful !
Thank you so much:)
Thank you for the tip ! I solved the issue :))
What code do you have rn OP?
Most of the symbolic functions call the underlying MuPAD symbolic engine for their computation. They're not written in Matlab code. 
The final problem is when I change the time to inf, external "Failed to generate all binary outputs. "
In Matlab, the variable "i" already has a meaning, I would advise against using it in a loop (I always use "ii")

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.The earliest known reference to the sieve (Ancient Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους, kóskinon Eratosthénous) is in Nicomachus of Gerasa's Introduction to Arithmetic, which describes it and attributes it to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a Greek mathematician. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Solve your own homework dude. I'll just give a single word hint: Recursion.
[This is the entire plant.](https://i.imgur.com/sSSuNtg.png) [Works fine if I leave the sine out.](https://i.imgur.com/Zt6DWHV.png)
Is this not a subreddit where homework questions are acceptable to ask? Why else would they include a homework flair? This isn't for a coding class, this is for a project in a math class. The problem I'm working on involves finding different ways to explore and represent a certain group of P-Tableaux of shape (1^n ) which happen to look like column vectors. Being that matlab is good for vector and array calculations, and that my matlab is really rusty, I'm seeking help on the method by which I can explore a certain problem in mathematics, not seeking an answer to a homework question. Dude.
Hey, I'm marking this as solved because I did it. In that first image, I double clicked on Kbb, entered the "signal attributes" tab. In there, I changed the Output data type, from "Inherit: Inherit via internal rule" to "double". Still, I would love someone with knowledge to comment here because I have no idea whatsoever on *why* that worked and, well, maybe someone from the future finds this topic.
maybe it's a rounding thing? I'm not at my Matlab computer atm, but maybe by summing you're changing it to a double and then there might be a rounding error making it slightly smaller than 255*3. Why not something like whiteInMask = (rImg1(:,:,1)==255 &amp;&amp; rImg1(:,:,2)==255 rImg1(:,:,3)==255) or (this will also replace close to white pixels) rgbSum &lt; 254.9*3 
https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/?utm_source=reddit-android tl;dr - people here will push you in the right direction but won't help you with your homework. You gave an example of your "project" with n=5. Assuming you've written all solutions for n=5, can you use these solutions to make simple modifications to get all the solutions for n=6? And so on, till you reach whatever value of n your heart desires. Even large values like n=10.
Okay. Thanks for the response here. I guess what I'm getting at is this: I know what I need to do and how to go about it on paper. I'm good with the mathematics and could produce these tableaux by hand for an arbitrary n fairly easily. What I'm struggling with is simply finding a good method to code this with in matlab. I've tried using "for" loops to generate different permutations, but the "rules" for these tableaux have me stumped as it's been a few years since I've coded anything. I'm struggling how best to communicate to matlab what I want it to do. As far as writing some sort of recursive algorithm, is there a method you believe could do the trick given some experimentation? Do you think matlab is even the best tool for the job?
I've tried changing rbgsum to 254.5 which didn't work but I'll try doing that. Do you mind checking to see if that gives a possible solution whenever you're free as I don't have access to matlab until tomorrow 
I thought about recursion because you said that the enumeration of this set is of size 2^(n-1) . So the two possibilities for n=2 are [1 2] and [2 1]. The first one of these can be modified to [1 2 3] and [1 3 2] and the second one can be modified to [3 2 1] and [2 1 3]. And so on. Each solution can be modified in two ways. E.g. [1 3 2] changes to [1432] and [1324]. Note the position of the newly inserted 4. Can you generalise this? The decrease can only be 1. No other decrease is allowed. Note the positions where 3 was inserted. I have basically solved the problem for you now.
What happens if you remove `'menubar','none'`?
I can try to answer to some of your questions (and then ask a few more questions because what you did may have solved your problem, but my instinct tells me that it's probably a bad fix, so I'll try to help you to get a good fix ;-) ) First of all, some answer. (they may be to detailed for what you are looking for, no need to remember everything) # Trying to answer some of your questions ### What does "double"/"sfix32_En26" mean? Double is the datatype of your signal. You can find a full description [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) but in short, when you work with numbers on a computer, they must be represented in some way inside the hardware. Number in mathematics can be natural, integer, real, complex, ... but in a computer they must be stored in some way. There are three common way to represent number in a computer: 1. Integer. Almost like Integer in mathematics, except that they have a finite size in memory. For example a int8 in Simulink (or any other computer language) can go from -128 to +127, but cannot represent 300, because it only uses 8 bits. 2. Floating points number. Integer are nice, but they cannot represent non integer values. Floating point number use some bits to represent the Mantisse M (the "value"), some bits to represent the exponent E, and one for the sign. The "double" in Simulink just tells you that this is this kind of number. In a double, M is 53, E is 11. See the linked page for more information. Floating points are nice because they can represent a large range of number (for example a double can go from 1e-308 to 1e308 approximatively) They have also disadvantage. But you probably want to stick with them if you don't know what these drawbacks are\*. 3. Fixed point numbers. sfix32_En26 is a fixed point number. Basically in this specific case, the number occupes 32 bits, and 26 are for the integral part. fixed point numbers have some advantages (they are "fast" to compute) but also drawbacks (the range is small relatively to floating point, you need to be sure of what you use, ...) Basically you don't want to use them (unless you know that you want to use them ### What you have done Usually people using Simulink for modelling and simulation\* don't really care about what I just said. They don't change anything, and it's fine, they let Simulink handle this. If you don't say anything to Simulink, everything will be a double. And most people are fine with this. In your model, you changed the output of the block Kbb from inherit to double. In Simulink, the data type of a signal is controlled by the block that create the signal. What you did was to say to the Kbb block to output a double, instead of using inheritance rules. In short, inheritance says "look around for what you need", and a gain block would look it's input, it's gain value, maybe also look at what the output is connected, to decide the data type of output. For example if you have a integer input, and a integer gain value, the output would be an integer (probably. And probably a bigger integer, because math...), but if you have a double input, and a double gain value, the output would be double. Usually, if you don't care about datatype, you should keep the inheritance rule. ### Why did you had an error? I cannot without having the model exactly tell it, but when you click on the "run" button, one of the first thing that Simulink has to do is to decide of the datatype. At this point it will look at your choice for output type, and a lot of stuff. And it's trying to resolve the inheritance rules. And sometimes, it's not possible. If you said that the output of a block need to be a integer, and it's connected to a block that needs a double, it's not possible, and you get an error. That's what was happening. But the real cause is unknown for me by only looking at your screenshot. There is much more in a model than what you can see visually (if you can share your model that had an error, I could look at it, if you want) # My question to you Or: Trying to fix your model in a better way. ### Do you know what "Sine" block do you use? My best bet is on the "Sine" block from the "Simulink&gt;Lookup table" library. To be sure, right click on the block and select "Library link&gt;Go to library", something like that. What's the name of the library that just opened? (in the title of the window) ### Why did you used this block? Do you wanted to use a lookup table, really? Or was it the first block that appeared when you typed "Sine"? (more likely) ### Can you change this block? I would suggest to cancel your changes in Kbb, and take the "Trigonometric Function" block from the "Simulink&gt;Math Operations" library. This one's output is double by default. Just be careful, you probably need to remove the gain that was multiplying by 1/(2*pi). # Going further If you want to know more: - about data type in computer in general: lookup for "number representation in computer" or something like this in google/youtube - about data type in Simulink in particular: Not exactly sure, maybe start from [here](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/working-with-data-types.html) or [here](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/control-signal-data-types.html) but I would say as a general rule: keep everything by default (which should be double/inherited) except if you have a specific need to change the type. \* people also use Simulink for code generation. They usually care. Some people may also care if they specifically want to simulate fixed point/integer arithmetic.
This is spam. Mods please handle this. 
+ (is this correct?) Hey, thanks for this big post! I agree, this is a bad fix, I just changed something that I don't even know, seems like a timebomb until it gives me more problems. I am willing to share the actual model, of course. Not sure how to do that, though. We would need an external site? As for the sine block, yes, unsurprisingly, I searched for "sine", got that block, noticed that its natural gain means its probably meant to be used on a frequency and not on a physical angle, but, in my head, just using a counter gain would be easy, no? I did what you said, you're right again, it's from a "Lookup table" library. Now that I'm using the basic trigonometric block, reverting the Kbb gain to what it originally was is still working. I'm still willing to share my model if you're curious, but at this point, we could just drop the issue since that was probably the problem. Man, I cannot believe I began to type this comment about 40 minutes ago. I was about to click on save when *electricity ran out*. This sucks. I'm surprised Firefox saved it.
what does typing `ulimit -a` return?
You might want to consider putting this in pastebin or something, a giant wall of poorly formatted text is kind of impenetrable--parts of it won't even copy/paste into MATLAB in a way that works (it breaks, e.g., the proper use of `...`). However, this does appear to be a gui-based program made with GUIDE, so unless you also have access to `program.fig`, you will be unable to use this program at all. When I put this code into a new file, put in a bunch of `end` statements just to make things calm down a bit, the error I get is: Error using load Unable to read file 'program.fig'. No such file or directory.
Ensure that the max value is 255 and not 1, as is the case with many images when they are double. If the max value is 255, try using &gt; 254, it'll be close enough surely.
Since both methods mentioned are numerical, the responsibility for keeping one variable or the other constant rests with you and how you define the discretization. 
Thank you, Ive figured it out by the time you replied, but I appreciate it very much.
Just use ode45 and set a low tolerance. It will be much faster than solving it analytically 
Why don't you look at the RGB values of some of the white pixels and see why they don't return true for your mask statement?
i tried that but it stays the same
If you use the [dir](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dir.html) function in MATLAB, it will return to you all of the files in a certain directory. So, if you were to put all of your data files into a single directory, then by using `dir` you could get a list of every file. Then, you could loop through the files, load them into MATLAB, and then plot the data from each file. 
I'm confused why you want to calculate data from a plot? If you have the data, why don't you just calculate the metrics you want from the data? 
&gt;I'm confused why you want to calculate data from a plot? If you have the data, why don't you just calculate the metrics you want from the data? I would rather calculate it from data also but as far as I know the entropy formula and fractal dimension box counting can only take a greyscale image as input, is there a way where I can input actual data in to those formulas?
I've tried 254 and it offers the same results, I can't seem to go any lower than that otherwise it starts replacing other pixels within the image
So I used your exact code on some sample images I made in paint, and it works perfectly. What you didn't show is how you loaded the images. Did you use `imread`?
I mean, I don't know what equations you're using, but I can't imagine that the equations need an image- I'm pretty sure the very first thing that the functions you're using does is read the image to make it back into data (look in the equation where it called `imread` and go from there). 
hmmm, I get what you're saying. I was using the built in entropy function linked [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/entropy.html) Does this one take normal data as input?
I used imread though I had to resize it image1 = imread('C:\Users\Velvet\Downloads\img1.jpg') image2 = imread('C:\Users\Velvet\Downloads\img2.jpg') rImg1 = imresize(image1, [768,1024]) rImg2 = imresize(image2, [768,1024]) Could that be the problem? 
Look up logical indexing.
Your question clear, either way, did you try subplot?
Seconded. Ideally you'd pull data from each folder and then produce multiple plots on a figure using [figure](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/figure.html) and [subplot](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html).
The thing I don't understand from the problem is how to use the second vector to pick out which are accurate back to the first vector?
Maybe? `imresize` interpolates pixels, so pixels which were white might not be white anymore. 
So, I don't really know much about that function, but it does seem very image specific. I guess what you could do is plot your data, use [saveas](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/saveas.html) to save it as an image, then use [imread](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html) to load that same image right away, and then call you entropy function. 
Yes, just managed to create a loop to do exactly that which will hopefully scan the whole data set and then input the entropy values as a new entry on a variable. Looks like its going to take a while with the data set as of now but hopefully it will be usable data as a result. Thanks mate!
Thank you!
The best thing I got so far was this: SubjectTest.ResponseTimes(\[1 3 4\]) &amp;#x200B; ans = &amp;#x200B; 1.2000 4.0000 5.0000 &amp;#x200B;
have you worked with IF statements?
That's giving you the correct answer but you're basically doing it by hand. What happens if your data is thousands of points? You need to tell Matlab to find the locations of the 1s in the second vector, then extract the values of the first vector that correspond to those locations.
So would I first have to input SubjectTest.Accuracy([1 3 4]) to find the locations of the 1s and then equal that to SubjectTest.ResponseTimes?
No, what I'm getting at is, what if you didn't know off the top of your head that [1,3,4] is what you needed. The `find` command will let you find the locations of values in a vector that meet a specified criteria. So use that on the second vector and apply the results to the first. You can actually solve this with one line of code.
Right. The solution to that is to look up logical indexing. 
How would that work? 
AccurateSamples = SubjectTest.ResponseTime(Accuracy (:));
It's not clear that entropy of an image of a line plot would yield useful information. You can calculate entropy of timeseries data with the first equation here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) though you'd likely need to convert your data into a symbolized format
&gt; We are here to help, but won't do your homework
Did you pass the '-X' option to ssh? Otherwise, does matlab have an option for launching without the GUI?
I beg your pardon, how do I use "-X"? you mean "SSH -l -X [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1)"? I'm connecting with MobaXterm. I don't need to write that command. 
"ssh -X &lt;the other arguments you were using&gt;" as an example "ssh -X -l user@192.168.0.1" The X is for X11 forwarding. You normally can't use a gui without that option. If you can't type in the command line option directly, look for a similar setting. I'm not familiar with MobaXterm, and I don't have a copy of matlab. If I remember correctly though, matlab has an argument to disable the gui (like -nogui or -batch), which I would try if I was debugging, since your log included a message about the display: uixDisplayInformation::getTopWindow(). 
I'm in a bio-mechanical course and we're using anthropometric data to solve for forces on a forearm. The set up of the matrix is not agreeing and we must use pinv. I tried lsqnonneg(LHS,RHS) too and that said "matrix dimensions must agree." Can anyone let me know where I went wrong? Or is it possible my numbers are wacky enough to not work? &amp;#x200B; (( sorry for the tag??-- homework help wasn't an option))
Hmm, what should I do instead? is there a way around this since both are different sizes initially
Thank you!
Thank you!
If the tools you have found don't work on the data you have, your response should be to find other tools.
That's for the entropy *of an image*. Since you're doing this with financial data, you probably know the formula you want applied to the data, right? If finance entropy is the same as in physics you want the sum of (p \* log(p)), right? So do that. 
There is a way to do it that way also but the regular image entropy formula also returns a measure for the complexity of a line, unadjusted. In this case its good enough for comparing different years of the same market in a time series but I appreciate the help! Managed to do it with a loop function and a few variables and saveas/imread. Cheers mate!
Except that that won't tell you what you want. The entropy of an image of your data is not the same thing as the entropy of your data. Not even a little bit. You might as well just generate random numbers. This is very enlightening about the current state of finance and economics. 
I'm not sure of the problem you're having. You don't know how to assign values to a variable? Or you don't know how to generate random numbers? Or you don't know how to randomly select an element of a list? Either way, it sounds like you're looking for one of the following functions: rand randn randi randperm Check out the documentation for each and you should be able to find what you need. 
Well, I appreciate the concern and I'll refrain from snarky comments but by the definition of it, as long as the image premises are kept the same and only the plot line (derived from the data) is changing, it will allow the complexity of the system to be measured. While that measure is not a meaningful number by itself, it can be ran through the market efficiency measure derived by Kristoufek &amp; Vosvrda. The definition of the entropy formula in Matlab is as follows: "Entropy is a statistical measure of randomness that can be used to characterize the texture of the input image. Entropy is defined as -sum(p.*log2(p)), where p contains the normalized histogram counts returned from imhist." I appreciate the concern but as far as the definition and calculations go, this is a good enough measure to compare different years of the market
Jesus christ. This is awesome. 
Well then, please do enlighten me of how to measure market efficiency on matlab

Tried putting a delay of 1 timestep in front of the function? What is the rest of the model? Is this just a feedback loop? What happen to the signal? Initial u?
I've updated the album to include a graph for the input u. This is not a feedback loop, the arrow going off the screen just leads to an output to workspace block. I haven't tried the timestep delay I'll have a look.
I guess the delay is not the fix, then. Most curious, I would expect something in the block, but can't think of anything. Turned it on and off again? Tried inputting something like a sine and just see what it does with that? Or a straight line, for that matter. 
Depends on what they look like. Depending on what the project is, this can be very very tricky. I had a professor in college who did research which involved scanning images for blood vessels, which was a lot harder than it seemed due to a variety of factors. It can be difficult to understand what makes a bubble. You know it when you see it, but you've got to convey that to the computer. When you're looking at the image, what's defining the boundaries of the bubble? You need to read the image into a matrix and scan through the values until you hit one that's consistent with the boundary of a bubble. Then you need to record that spot and continue scanning until you reach the other edge of the bubble. That's how you'd detect it. To measure it, you'd just do the same thing, but somehow make it happen at the center (vertically or horizontally) of the bubble, then record the amount of pixels you traverse to get to the other boundary, and that's the diameter.
If the bubble is a certain size it's just some basic image processing. You create a convolution filter using an *idealized* picture of a bubble and then pick out the bright spots using threshholding. Its good that bubbles are rotationally invariant, but they're not scale invariant, so you might have to look for different sized bubbles in separate passes.
¿what have you tried? ¿are you familiar with Hough transform? I think a goodplace to start is just find circles [imfindcircles](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfindcircles.html) it will work with certain conditions [example](https://imgur.com/a/XEsTDfi)
Why don't you just post your questions here and then you can get lots of people to help you instead of one. 
[Here are the questions](https://imgur.com/a/Z6OY0xU)
OK. And here [are the rules for asking for Homework help](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). Where are you stuck? What do you need help with? What have you tried?
Honestly, I couldn't even answer any question, as you saw its pretty basic matlab functions and im not asking for anybody to do my homework, I could just use a little help and guiding so I can get back on my feet.
I tried a sin input and it works perfectly, I'm completely bamboozled by this, I've no idea what to do
Please see our [rules for submitting homework questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/). You have to give us a starting point so we know how to help
Let's go 1 by 1. 1. You should start by getting the expression in a form more suitable for computers. How would you do that? 
((1/y)\*x.\^3)-(1/y)=(x.\^3)+(x.\^2)+x; ??
That's a start, but it's a lot easier if you get it into a form with an independent and a dependent variable. For example: 9x^3 - y = x^2 + 7x y = 9x^3 - x^2 - 7x 
Do you know how to make a function in MATLAB? Do you know how to use the `plot` command? Do you know need help with the math? Saying "I don't even know how to start" is useless. Everyone at least knows something. What you should ask is "if I knew how to do (fill in the blank) then I could solve this problem" and then ask that. I literaly don't know if you don't know how to solve for a variable, what the work "max" means or syntax of using a plot command. 
So should I make it like this? (x^(3)\-1)/(x^(3)\+x^(2)\+x) = y 
Yes. Now what do you know about plotting? You need to put that expression into MATLAB, and give it some kind of reference as to what x is. There's a few ways to do this. You can look up "fplot" or "ezplot". You can also plot y over some range of x. That would just be using normal "plot" with x being defined with something like "x = -a:b"
I know a few functions and I dont think I need help with the math, but since i take many coding courses in different languages i frequently get mixed up. So i dont know what format i should write the functions in and etc.
For 2. This is really an exercise in math and plot identification. Answer these questions: - What shape is the blue curve? What is the equation of that curve? - What shape is the yellow curve? What is the equation of that curve? - etc..for all the systems.
Then ask a directed question. Seriously, I'm trying to help you. You just keep saying "I can't do anything!!" Ask a question about proper formatting a function if you're confused about that. Quit this "I'm helpless" crap. 
Im sorry I annoyed you too much but, i gave the x a range as low as -8:8 and as big as -100:100 but each time I plot a graph it just gives me a blank graph. Is there a reason to this?
Look at what changes with each step. At first, you need to build A,B. Then it looks like you are assigning the values of a row of A (the first row) with some values from B. Then you do something similar. Next what are you doing with A to get the zeros into the right spot?
Hey homie, adding on to what JJ_The_Jet is saying, this subreddit is really good for kind of pointers of what you should google to get something done. Asking something like "How do I find bubbles in an image?" will get a really good range of starting points like "Look up this command" or "Read up about this". If you haven't done any coding before there are plenty of exercises out there to get you started - Google's even got some games - but you should look up commands like if and while, boolean operators in Matlab, as well as basic variable manipulation, and then come up with little things you want to try and make like a text-based game or plot some graphs (maybe make them interactive with the GUIDE) to get used to how Matlab differs from other languages and the like. Doing your own thing alongside the weird, specific, mathsy homework stuff it looks like you're being set is always good practice in my experience. PS text-based games aren't too hard to make and are really rewarding and fun, so I recommend it as a self-set tutorial in MatLab.
Yes, what does your workspace show? Is y an array? If not, use ./ between the numerator and the denominator.
noted. thank you so much. i apologize though for the inconvenience because i really did not know how to start i did search for tutorials to get me going. i understand some. but the others still confuse me. is it ok if i ask about the part &gt;&gt;A (___) = B (___) i get that there are values from A and B. i resorted to do the trial-and-error method in my matlab to get this &gt;&gt;A (1, : ) = B (3, : ) A= 9 10 11 12 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 but why? how come it should be A (1, : ) = B (3, : ) i searched for explanations online regarding this context but i cannot seem to find what i am looking for
yes. this won't happen again. i apologize.
So in your example, the answer is 0? I'm trying to make sure I understand the question.
Yes exactly, should have put one where the answer is at least one haha, so if it was as follows 5 0 0 4 5 0 1 4 5 2 1 4 In this case row 3 is the only one that matches the condition
 myMat = [5 0 0;4 5 0;1 4 5;2 1 4]; count = 0; for ii = 1:size(myMat,1) if ((myMat(ii) &lt; myMat(ii,2)) &amp;&amp; (myMat(ii,2) &lt; myMat(ii,3))) count = count+1; end end
You want to use diff() for this. Check out the documentation. If you look at the positions where the output of diff() is greater than 0 you should have what you want. 
have you turned it off and on again? as in close all clear all clc and then run it from your workspace
Thanks! Will take a look at it
Thanks! Will test it out
No problem. Let me know if it doesn't work, haha
To add on to what /u/synchh said, you can probably reduce this down by using the colon operator: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html % A is my matrix of data myRows = A(:, 1) &lt; A(:, 2) &amp; A(:, 2) &lt; A(:, 3); myCount = sum(myRows);
A first step might be to calculate the gradient matrix of the picture and then use edge detection. The resulting matrix with edges can be analyzed for circular structures. I don't have any extensive knowledge within the subject but this might be a good start. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge\_detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection)
Haha, exactly what I meant. Definitely better ways to do it. Just that I'd need to actually try it in MATLAB if I wanted to figure that out. I don't do well programming without testing lol
Thanks!
I'm not familiar with solving differential equations but have you considered using a numerical solver? did some fast stuff, i have no knowledge about graphicly displaying stuff in real time so the displaying part is real ugly &amp;#x200B; [https://pastebin.com/vpGSD5z4](https://pastebin.com/vpGSD5z4) &amp;#x200B; Have no idea if it helps you in any way. Have a nice day sir!
I'm trying to solve this, do you have a deadline?
Just literally uninstalled 2018a, installed 2018b and it has exactly the same problem
No not really, end of the module is this friday so it would be nice to hand it in on that day. But the teacher didn't specify a deadline and is on vacation so im aiming to hand it in before the end of next week. Thanks for helping in advance!
I'll have it by friday! Hang on buddy :) By the way, do you know numerical methods? Finite Differences, that's what i'll use
Please don't just do his homework for him. You can help guide him, but we do not cheat for people. 
Did you try pulling values from u and v to see if they seem reasonable? Might be an error in the data you plot rather than the plot command.
I'll try guiding him on the numerical schemes so he can implement. That's why I asked if he knew finite differences :) Thanks for pointing out though
This course is named numerical methods, we had lectures on ODEs and PDEs. Went through most of matlabs implemented ODE/PDE solvers. As you can see knowledge of fluid dynamics and heat transport is also necessary but I didn't take those courses because of private circumstances. Also missed quite some lectures on the numerical methods course because of this. So I spend the past few days watching recorded lectures. Friends told me this would be doable using pdepe. Could anyone confirm this is possible? Because if that's not the case I'm doing it for no reason
This one worked absolute wonders! Cannot thank you enough mate!
if you know how to flatten the correlation matrix you can feed it into ggplot2...you'll have more control over the plot aesthetics 
I would recommend going through the MATLAB Onramp tutorial. It gives a good overview of the basic MATLAB syntax, which will help when asking questions or searching for documentation. https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html I would go through the first five sections or so, since it looks like sections 3 and 5 are especially relevant to this post. If you still have questions after going through the tutorial, I can point you toward some more specific documentation.
OK, so I don't know anything about pdepe. Here's what I would do: write down all the constants the problem gives you, such as &lt;v&gt;, R and a. Then start a "while" loop in order to go through the whole rod (0&lt;z&lt;100). Inside this "while", write a "for" loop that goes through the whole radius (0&lt;r&lt;0.125), and then solve the finite difference scheme, with: T(z,r)=T(z,r)+term\*dz Where term=(a/(2\*v(r)))\*((T\_r(r-1)-T\_r(r)+T\_r(r+1))/dr\^2+(T\_r(r+1)-T\_r(r-1))/(2\*r\*dr)); Notice that I've used second order central schemes for the partial derivatives. Notice that you will have to store all the T(r) for each z, in order to satisfy the problem. Also, when z=100, you will have the temperature distribution at the outlet. The symmetry boundary condition states that T(0+dr)=T(0), so you can start the temperature diffusion (first 2 points are equal). You should define dr = R / N\_r and dz = 100/ N\_z, with N\_r and N\_z a parameter that you set for how many points you want the discretization to have. Beware of stability issues, though.
I should clarify that T\_r is a variable I did when it was not necessary to keep stored all the points, so it should be T(z,r) instead.
Thank a lot! Really appreciate it!
Here are some suggestions. To change the size. Try modifying the Position property. This is not the best way for traditional plots but a heatmap is not a traditional plot. &gt;heatmapHandle = heatmap(...); &gt; &gt;heatmapHandle.Position = \[left bottom width height\]; Setting the width to the height is a good start. Go from there. &gt;heatmapHandle.Position(3) = heatmapHandle.Position(4); For color, try using &gt;heatmapHandle = heatmap(...); &gt; &gt;colormap pink; look at colormap in help to see the different prebuilt colormaps or build your own. You can customize more of the properties if you look at the HeatmapChart properties in help. # 
It seems you are using i as the iterating variable in your for loop. Please beware that i already exists and you are overwriting it's value and function. This quickly becomes unpredictable and could be the source of your i problem. In a Matlab for loop, always use ii, or better yet, something meaningful like iValue (depending on the context)
I don't think he is overwriting i despite using it as a loop variable -- in my experience, Matlab protects the imaginary unit (1i). While you make a good point that it would be a better practice not to overload i with two meanings for clarity, I think that this probably not causing a problem here. 
I did not think that much about the example you gave, so I'm not sure if this is your problem, but is it possible that for this test function, the secant method is leaving the original search region? For instance, see the [false position method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_position_method) for similar algorithms which are guaranteed to converge. 
&gt; I instead get this error There are no errors in your screenshot. But I guess you think that seeing “num/den” instead of “1/s^2…” is what you call an error. You get this because there is no space to write the full denominator on the block. Try increasing the size of the block (put your mouse over a corner of the block and click-and-drag)
So, I don't see an error. If you are referring to the "num(s) / den(s)" it is just how simulink displays transfer functions that don't physically fit inside the block. They should work totally identically. To make it look the same hit "ok" on the block parameters, click the block, then resize it by grabbing the handles like in [this screen shot](https://imgur.com/QF7iEZf). Then if you drag it larger you should get [something like this.](https://imgur.com/0oZ9orP) Is that what you mean?
Oh wow. Thank you.
Thank you.
I think that when he says "solve" he means generate the equations of motion.
I think your problem is that you haven't cleared your workspace. Somehow 'eq1' and 'eq2' ended up being defined as having the value of zero which is causing solve to throw an error. Try running this close all clear all syms g l1 l2 m1 m2 theta1 theta2 omega1 omega2 alpha1 alpha2 x1= l1*sin(theta1); y1= -l1*cos(theta1); x2 = x1+l2*sin(theta2); y2 = y1-l2*cos(theta2); dx1 = omega1*l1*cos(theta1); dy1 = omega1*l1*sin(theta1); dx2 = dx1 + omega2*l2*cos(theta2); dy2 = dy1 + omega2*l2*sin(theta2); d2x1 = -omega1^2*l1*sin(theta1)+alpha1*l1*cos(theta1); d2y1 = omega1^2*l1*cos(theta1)+alpha1*l1*sin(theta1); d2x2 = d2x1-omega2^2*l2*sin(theta2)+alpha2*l2*cos(theta2); d2y2 = d2y1+omega2^2*l2*cos(theta2)+alpha2*l2*sin(theta2); eq1 = sin(theta1)*(m1*d2y1+m2*d2y2+m2*g+m1*g)==-cos(theta1)*(m1*d2x1+m2*d2x2); eq2 = sin(theta2)*(m2*d2y2+m2*g)==-cos(theta2)*m2*d2x2; solutions = solve([eq1 eq2],[alpha1 alpha2]); solutions.alpha1 solutions.alpha2 When I do in Matlab R2018a I get the following ans = -(g*m1*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1) + g*m2*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1) + g*m1*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)^2 - l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta1)*sin(theta2)^3 + l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta2)^3*sin(theta1) - g*m2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*sin(theta2) - l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)^2 + l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) + l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)^2 + l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1) - l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta2) - l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta2))/(l1*(m1*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)^2 + m1*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 + m1*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1)^2 + m2*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 + m2*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1)^2 + m1*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 - 2*m2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2))) ans = -(g*m1*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) + g*m2*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) - l1*m1*omega1^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)^3 + l1*m1*omega1^2*cos(theta1)^3*sin(theta2) - l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)^3 + l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)^3*sin(theta2) - g*m1*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1) - g*m2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1) + l1*m1*omega1^2*cos(theta1)*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) + l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) + l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta1)*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)^2 - l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2) - l1*m1*omega1^2*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1) - l1*m2*omega1^2*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1) - l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1) + l2*m2*omega2^2*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)*sin(theta2))/(l2*m1*cos(theta1)^2*cos(theta2)^2 + l2*m1*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 + l2*m1*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1)^2 + l2*m2*cos(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 + l2*m2*cos(theta2)^2*sin(theta1)^2 + l2*m1*sin(theta1)^2*sin(theta2)^2 - 2*l2*m2*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)) Which seems like a reasonable solution, I am not going to check it thoroughly. Any more questions let me know 
Consider trying to raise the simulation tolerances (in simulation/Model Configuration parameters/Solver/Solver Details) Then raise the relative tolerance up, like from 1e-3 to 1e-9 (just to error check). If that doesnt change it, maybe try taking the integral result, differentiating it and graphing that as well?
So, other than the annoying warning the code is working fine for me (I think, I am not sure exactly what you are trying to do). You can delete the 'erasemode','none' with no real problem. There is a single point darting all over the plot until you hit the button and it stops. It is kinda hard to see with the current marker size. If you change the markersize to something larger (like 10) then it will be clearer that it is working correctly.
Fractional exponents is a clean way to do it, as an alternative you can also use the nthroot function. Like cubic root of X is nthroot(X,3) https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/nthroot.html
somewhat more fun is [cumtrapz](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cumtrapz.html)
random follow up... Didn't actually solve it as the toolbox somewhere has it hardcoded which version of save to use... I found a config file and changed the save format there, but the specific script that saves in this one instance has it hardcoded again!! 
ok, here's something to try: - create a user-defined function `save.m` with the following code: function save(varargin) keyboard builtin('save', varargin{:}) end - place it high on the path: addpath('C:\path\to\folder', '-begin') - run your toolbox which ultimately saves to MAT-file, you should hit a breakpoint on the `keyboard` line. Inspect the arguments and the call-stack and report back
oh thanks, good idea. I think I've manually backtracked far enough to find the function in question, but if it doesn't work this time (takes about 3/4 hours to run) then I'll try that! 
It just occurred to me my above function won't work correctly since it doesn't have access to the variables of the calling function (i.e the `builtin` call will fail with "variable not found" errors). You'll have to use `evalin` to get the variables from the "caller" workspace.. 
You should not "generate all permutations and then check", but instead "generate a permutation check it if valid add to the basket else continue". That way your computer doesn't crash but takes a lot of time. In Python this is the generator behavior with `yield` to get one at a time instead. Then you can run `diff` on your current permutation and check for any negative number other than -1.
Oh that makes perfect sense. 
Hi so far I’ve tried just using an image with circles on it: image=imread(‘circleimage.png’); I=rgb2gray(image); BW=imbinarize(I, 0.6); BW1=edge(I, ‘Sobel’); imshow(BW1) This is bringing back a black background with white circles.. no idea how to measure / count the circles now? 
Hi thanks for your reply!! so far I’ve tried just using an image with circles on it: image=imread(‘circleimage.png’); I=rgb2gray(image); BW=imbinarize(I, 0.6); BW1=edge(I, ‘Sobel’); imshow(BW1) This is bringing back a black background with white circles.. no idea how to measure / count the circles now? 
Since this is obviously homework I don’t want to give away too much... But start with assigning a scalar value to each variable (C,D etc.) and make a vector x that contains the x-values you want the function to take as input. Then try to figure out what to do with these based on the functions given. 
 sprintf('%05.2f', x) instead of num2str
If you read the [docs on num2str](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/num2str.html) you'll see that you can control the precision via the second argument
That was set up by /u/chartporn- he should see this username reference and maybe he can answer. 
check the documentation and first example in [imfindcircles](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfindcircles.html) the output in that function gives you centers and radius for each circle detected, you can estimate the area or size from that values, also, is a little redundant binarize your image and then detect edges, usuallly the edge algorithms detection already do that, you can test another edge options like 'canny' or 'sobel'
Didn’t even think about that, thank you!
Great, thanks!
What are you trying to do? Just write them in Matlab? Have you searched the documentation? Basic mathematical functions are very well documented. 
or if you wanna use num2str: num2str(x,'%.2f') 
thanks for you help ! This solved my issue :D
The specific action you're doing in "A(1,:)", for example, is called *indexing.* If you look up indexing in Matlab, you'll find tons of support on this. In your example, of "A(1, :) = B(3, :)", you're saying "put the third row of B, into the first row of A". The contents of the parentheses is in the format of "(row, column)", so "A(1,1)" would be the first row, first column of A. There are other things you can put in these parentheses, though. A colon (:), means "all", so "A(:,:)", means "all o fA", or "A(1,:)", means "all columns, first row, of A".
It's specifying the data points to be open circles, colored blue, with no line between points. Then MarkerFaceColor fills the inside blue too.
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html ”o” = marker is circle “b” = color is blue
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/linespec.html
Figured it out! was a lot simpler than I thought it'd be 
Out of interest, how did you manage this?
 cat() 
CrapData = cat(3, set1, set2, set3) did the trick
Thanks! :)
This is a general question and most likely isn't Matlab specific. The point at which a filter has a gain of 1/2 is frequently called the 3dB point. This is frequently taught at the point which defines the pass-band region of a filter. [Read up on filters in general](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html) so you do not get lost in the sauce of their applications and trade-offs.
Thanks and this is a matlab questions(?) what made you say it isn't? I need to merge two images using the software but I also do not want to but blatant homework question for someone else to do. My professor is an arse who provides no documentation or help and just gives assignments so all learning has to be done by us.
Can you post an example figure? Also, you may have to adjust the scale of u and w. Try normalizing them and scaling them by some value to see if that helps with them extending too far.
Could you resize the other image instead? That way you would preserve the white pixels. 
Thank you!
I have copy pasted your code word for word and I am still running into the exact same errors. Even with using close all and clear all at the start eq1 and eq2 are still 0
Yeh Billy is right^
Update: It seems to depend what computer I'm on. On my home PC that code works fine but on one in my university it doesn't. Seems strange
1 and 3 are more computer science questions and don't require matlab. For 2 (and pretty much any matlab problem) work it out by hand on paper first to figure out how you would solve it. Then, you can start playing with matlab to see how you would code it.
Well, since you know the answer, calculating the maximum value of a number that can be stored as a floating point value based on the parameters provided is probably not the problem (I have not verified that, so don't take that statement as confirmation 13 is the right answer). You can do that in MATLAB the same way you would with a calculator (substituting \* for multiplication and \^ for exponents). &amp;#x200B; If I were you, I would start by looking at while loops and conditional statements (if, else, etc.). Figure out how you can calculate the value of n! starting at some initial value (presumably 1), and increment it on each pass through the loop until it exceeds the maximum value allowed by your floating point number system, and return the previous value of n that did not exceed your limit. Also, maybe check out the factorial function to avoid having to nest another loop inside your while loop. &amp;#x200B; If you get some code together (even if it won't run), I can help you further. If you have questions about how to get started with that, feel free to ask. Sorry your profs are not being more helpful!
That's a fun one! I'm having a bit of trouble interpreting some of your variables - and I'm not sure, but there might be a conceptual issue here. Just to be clear, we have: &amp;#x200B; dy/dt = y\^(1/3) \[1\] And you have found a solution y(t) = (2t/3 + c)\^(3/2) \[2\] where c = y(0)\^(2/3). but note that there is also the trivial solution, y(t) = 0. \[3\] &amp;#x200B; If we have an initial condition y(0) = 0, then either solution still works, right? How will Euler's method know which one to approximate? &amp;#x200B; Next, check that we can substitute \[2\] into \[1\] to obtain dy/dt = (2t/3 + c)\^(1/2) \[4\] &amp;#x200B; So far, so good? See any mistakes yet? I went ahead and solved that equation, please make sure to check it! y(t) = (2/9)(sqrt(6k+6t)(t+k)) \[5\] where k = 9y(0)/(2sqrt(6)). &amp;#x200B; (\[5\] and \[2\] are just different forms saying the same thing, but \[5\] came from a differential equation where I could apply separation of variables without any weirdness happening). &amp;#x200B; \- Make sure to review separation of variables! It's not technically correct to treat dy/dt as a fraction, but it usually works so well we just do it without thinking. \- Also, you don't generally want to use Euler's method unless your solution is unique. In this case, the problem occurs when y = 0. In that case, it is an ill-posed initial value problem and you do not have enough information to decide which solution is "correct" (and neither does Euler's method). You just have two possible solutions. \- By rewriting the differential equation as a function of t, we eliminated the trivial solution. However, note that doing so required us to first have an analytic solution. \- I absolutely love the idea of having a code to compare numerical and analytical solutions. Just be aware that it might not work properly on any equation you can throw at it. For example, many (dare I say, most?) differential equations have no analytic solutions. &amp;#x200B; I'll post some code below that plots all of these. Solution \[5\] will be thick black, I'll use Euler's method to approximate \[1\] and \[4\] with dotted blue and green lines, and I'll also plot the dsolve solution (which I think was your original question) in red. Note that dsolve returns two answers when y(0) = 0 (both the trivial and non-trivial solution) - otherwise we don't have a problem and all of these equations are saying the same thing. &amp;#x200B; Compare the results with y0 = 0 and y0 &gt; 0.

Not knowing what the cut-off frequency means is a question not specific to Matlab and frequently covered in a signal processing class. There wasn't a question about a function or an error in the initial post. It read like there was confusion about understanding the question than implementing a Gaussian filter on an image via [imgausfilt()](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imgaussfilt.html).
thanks so much for your help. So I don't know if this is what you meant but I tried to code the floating number system F(2,24,-100,100) for question 1 by using an example that my prof did for F(10,2,-1,2). I really have no idea how to incorporate n! into any of this though, do you know if I'm even on the right track with what I'm doing with this code? Sorry if I'm completely wrong, please let me know if I'm beyond help with this. function flx=floatingnumber(x) % find the floating number % beta=2, L=-100, U=100, t=24 %% sign of x % if x&gt;=0 % pm=1; % else % pm=-1; % end pm=sign(x); x=pm\*x; %% find the exponent e=0; while x&gt;=1 e=e+1; x=x/10; end while x&lt;0.1 e=e-1; x=10\*x; end %% floating number if e&lt;-100 flx=1; elseif e&gt;100 flx=0; b=zeros(1,3); for k=1:25 x=x\*10; if x&gt;=0 &amp; x&lt;1 b(k)=0; elseif x&gt;1 b(k)=1; end x=x-b(k); end if b(25)&lt;=5 flx=(b(1)/10+b(2)/100)\*10\^e; else flx=(b(1)/10+(b(2)+1)/100)\*10\^e; end end flx=pm\*flx;

I think macs do some kind of anti-aliasing at the OS level. It's not a Matlab thing. 
hmm, can you check what toolboxes you have?
Correct. [“MacOS uses subpixel rendering as well, as part of Quartz 2D. Unlike Microsoft’s implementation, which favors a tight fit to the grid to maximise legibility, Apple’s implementation prioritizes the shape of the glyphs as set out by their designer.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering#OS_X)
Use histogram instead of hist. These functions give you the count of the data within each bin. Just normalise the countdown somthay the area of all the bins is unity. 
I mean......this sounds quite hard. You want people to just whip this up for you?
I love the idea on programming forums that people just have “code” lying around for very specific domain specific problems to hand you that will do exactly what you want. To be fair, sometimes there kind of is in libraries or github, but this isn’t the way to find it.
Start by solving it on paper without Matlab. You can't code what you don't know.
I'd use a keyboard, personally. 
mmm... i don't know... sounds kinda tedious. I think I'll use my neural-cortex silica-retrofit interconnectors to mesh my concious thoughts with my Windows personal compu... #&lt;&lt;BLUE SCREEN&gt;&gt;
You can let `histogram` do the normalization: `histogram(...,'Normalization', 'pdf')` OP: do you mean that the PDF is supposes to be uniform (rectangle) and compare to that? You could use the histogram function, then estimate the value of A from that. X in your equation is just the different values (amplitudes) the signal can take.
Well, technically, the question asks me to visualise the function, then state what distribution the PDF looks like.
Sadly as others mention, Apple has invested in some very fancy rendering stuff for almost 3 decades. While it's not exactly the same, I use the "Consolas" font for Windows, and find it reasonably aesthetically pleasing. 
In addition to checking toolboxes, there's one thing that has repeatedly left me chasing my tail: Look in the folder your code is in, and any additional folders that you've added to your Matlab path. Check for '.m' files that share names with your variables or commands. For example, if you have a file called 'syms.m' in the folder, Matlab is going to call this instead of it's own 'syms' command. May not be your problem, but it's high on my "why is Matlab acting weird today?" checklist.

It tells the program when it should jump back to the start of the loop. Think of it as a kind of delimiter, like {}.
A loop executes a set of code repeatedly. You need end to separate what gets repeated from the rest of your code--in most programming languages I've encountered, spaces and indents alone don't do anything. They're just for readability.
First off, I think you are using z inside the cosine where it should be n(z). To do this in a signle loop you can probably just replace the inner for loop with r(y) = sum( Cn.*cos( n.*w0.*t(y) + thetan) ); The basic idea is that Cn, n and theta are each vectors. The quantity inside the sum is set up to calculate a vector where each element is one element of the summation.
Thanks. Consolas looks a lot better than the default.
If you didn't have it, how would you know when the loop... *end*ed? 
Sorry, for vague description. I have written a code, but my time stepping algorithm for solving transient problem is producing some fluctuating output. With no heat generation and heat influx, my temperature is rising from initial temperature.
It's just the syntax that some random person thoughbofbwhrnever they created matlab. It's like saying why does × as muktiplation work. 
Hey there! There are a few mistakes that I noticed in your code. I'll list them so that way you can try and figure out what's going on: 1. In your `array2table` call, you're only using one of your number sets (`D`), which seems like it won't work to give you both degrees and radians output in your table. 2. When you've figured out what I mean in the previous item, make sure your matrix of data is in the proper orientation/dimensions for what would be organized into a table. *Hint: MATLAB seems to prefer items of the same type to be in columns.* 3. You're close on your name-value pair with `'Variable names'`, but not quite there. Check out the [docs for `array2table`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html) to see what I mean. 4. You don't need to include the `'--------'` in your `array2table` call. It will add the table lines in for you.
Thank you! I'll give this a try!
Thank you! I'll give this a try!
Isn't that inner loop just a sum over z? You may even be able to write it all in a single line. Maybe using bsxfun, depending on the shape of the inputs. 
I got my first one down with the last option being an user entered name. I would assume I need to use switch and case?
The probability of this goes as 2^n / n! Which is pretty bad for large n. A recursive solution is much better.
So, the most efficient way to do this is (probably) something like the following: % reshape stuff dependent on 'y' into column vectors and stuff dependent on 'z' into row vectors Cn=reshape(Cn,1,[]); z=[1:numel(Cn)]; thetan=reshape(thetan,1,[]); t=[0:Tsample:(4*(2*pi/w0))].'; % compute expression via bsxfun, then sum over 2nd dimension via matrix multiplication with vector of 1's. r will be a column vector the same size as y r = ( bsxfun(@times, Cn, cos( bsxfun(@plus, thetan, bsxfun(@times, w0*z, t) ) )) * true(numel(Cn),1);
You'll want to check out the documentation for cellfun and the section about anonymous functions. 
 func_name = @(x) do_stuff(x) is an anonymous function. Just a one-line function with less computational overhead than a function in a separate file. `num2str` does just that: takes a num (numeric type) and turns it into a str (string). `cellfun` applies the same function (in this case the anonymous function) to each cell in a cell array. So something like this {10, 15, 20} will become {'10', '15', '20'}.
‘’’ disp(MyMatrix(MyMatrix==1)) displays all values in MyMatrix that is equal to 1 (pretty pointless, but at least you can see how many 1s there are). Use that as a start and play with it. 
Interestingly, this is a case where defining an anonymous function is unnecessary, since "num2str" is already a function. You can create a [function handle](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html) to "num2str" instead, so that cellfun(@(x)str2num(x), myStrings) would become cellfun(@str2num, myStrings)
For this particular case you can by pass str2num and write cell2num(myStrings) 
I don’t think you need the find function. Just do a for loop, loop through from 1 to the length of the given data array. Use an if statement within the for loop to do your modulo and add the results to a new array. Then return your new array. 
So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you have a matrix that looks something like: Mat1=\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\]; &amp;#x200B; and you've managed to produce a matrix that looks like: Mat2=\[0,1,0,1,0,1\]; &amp;#x200B; if so, you could use a loop? &amp;#x200B; Out=\[\]; for i= 0 to size(Mat1) if Mat2(i)=1 Out=\[Out, Mat1(i)\]; else end end &amp;#x200B; There's probably a function to do this, though I don't know what it is. What I've done is made an output matrix (the empty Out\[\];) and then any time Mat2 returns a positive, it adds the corresponding Mat1 value to the output matrix. &amp;#x200B;
Hey thank you much I actually figured it out I ended up using: function [Output] = removeEvens (inputRowArray) DecideZero= find(mod(inputRowArray, 2) == 0); EvensOnly = inputRowArray(decideZero) End COMMAND: InputRowArray = randperm(n, k); removeEvens(inputRowArray) &lt;enter&gt; Note: this program is very addicting to figure out can’t wait to get into some real coding with it, thank you again. 
The one restriction is that I can not use a loop 
The only restriction is no loop functions unfortunately, very beginning of the class right now 
Ok, going back to my same previous variables, try: Out=Mat1(Mat2==1)); I don't have Matlab any long, but I THINK this might work. Mat2==1 should find the indexes of Mat2 that are equal to one, and take the corresponding values from Mat1, and then put them into the Out variable. Disclaimer: I haven't used MatLab since I graduated 2 years ago, so my syntax may be off. 
&gt; using a combination of indexing logic and empty array operator Strictly speaking, I think the assignment wants you to find the odd numbers and replace them with `[]`.
No worries man I was actually able to do it using the find function and some variations of indexing, I believe is the right term, I really appreciate your help. 
LOL, I just edited my comment 10 seconds before you posted this. Good deal. Good luck in the future! :) MatLab is a good tool, learn it well!
&gt; it says that compiler is not installed. this might be the case on windows but (assuming you didnt delete GCC) on the linux systems the compiler is installed. It might just need to be setup. idk if this will work, but try running mex -setup and then try installing MCR
On Windows, you can compile MATLAB scripts to a CTF file and the use MWArray.dll provided by MathWorks to execute the script from C#. You can also generate C# code using the same MATLAB Compiler to see how MWArray.dll should he used. The MATLAB Compiler is not free, but once compiled, it's free to use the Runtime with your application. On Linux, or .net core, I don't see any option yet. You can use Java to call the Runtime on Linux, but that defeats the purpose of .net core.
So correct me if I'm misunderstanding this, but you want a matrix of elements akin to something like this: M = [p*t, p*t^2, p*t^3, ... , p*t^m; p^2*t, p^3*t, ... ; ..., p^n*t, ... p^n*t^m]; Where the dimensions of the matrix are defined by the length of the p and t vectors, which are 1xn and 1xm, respectively. If this is the case, then by transposing the p vector to become nx1, then you can multiply the two vectors against one another and they should create the matrix you want. p = [1xn]; t = [1xm]; M = p'*t = [nx1]*[1xm] = nxm 
Yeah I believe you are right, that is what the suggestion was but I just couldn’t figure it out. Which I think is the beauty of coding, there is always another way lol. Thank you for your input however. 
Will do man thank you! 
Your notation implies exponitiation? Is that just notation? Essentially if i imagine myself walking along the first row, i should only be progressing through the t vector, and my p value should be constant, and if i walk down the first column, i should vary in my p vector but not in my t vector.
Not sure if I'm correctly interpreting what you're looking for, but it sounds like you're describing something that you could construct from the outputs of the `meshgrid` function. 
Sounds like you might want to watch an intro to simulink tutorial to understand how it uses signal/bus lines similar to variables, and blocks as functions/operations. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to making a tutorial. Must be a bunch of them on YouTube. &amp;#x200B; Simulink tends to be much easier to read/write than normal code...once you get used to it.
 func = @(x) x( mod(x, 2) == 0) I think that would work, but I don't have Matlab handy to test it.
I was thinking the same thing, but I wasnt sure if I could then define a function f(t,p) and then use each t and p value at each element of the array, and replace it in the matrix with the function value, considering t and p, as its inputs.
Do you know the properties of the graphene supercap you are trying to model?
Again, I'm not 100% sure that we're on the same page, but if I understand you correctly then this is basically exactly the purpose of `meshgrid`. I'll post an example code snippet once I'm back on my computer (on mobile currently and heading to bed shortly, so not until tomorrow)
probability of what?
Probability of generating a valid permutation. For size n, there are 2^n valid permutations according to the rules and n! total permutations.
If you were doing this in Simulink you can just reference it using s functions and c callers.
Can you define it in a separable way, such that the final matrix has elements which are described by f(p) \* g(t)? If so you can do an outer product to get the matrix. Alternatively you can use meshgrid. 
Unfortunately not. I was told it just needs to be a normal graphene supercap, but I don't know what properties or which parts of the code I need to change in order to get that result.
No, I'm writing a script in Matlab that is supposed to do the same thing as the c++ code but trying to understand the whole code is a bit difficult so that's why I'm looking for a good strategy to rewrite the code, thanks for you answer anyway :) 
Thanks, I'll look for some tutorials on Simulink on YouTube. &gt;Simulink tends to be much easier to read/write than normal code...once you get used to it. Here's hoping
It looks like it's simply combining separate R,G,B channels into one array. Say you had three 2D-matrices in MATLAB of same size, one for each color channel: R = rand(480,640); G = rand(480,640); B = rand(480,640); what the C++ code is doing is basically combining them as: RGB = cat(3, R, G, B); 
I see. I'd start with understanding and translating line by line then. Expect some instructions to be lost in translation, such as memcpy being just assignments in MATLAB.
&gt;d three 2D-matrices in MATLAB of same size, one for e I see, so memcpy should be an assignment to a variable in Matlab. thanks :) 
Thanks, translating a language to another it's a torture lol
Indeed. From a practical perspective, if you can just call the c/cpp coder directly, there's no need to translate them to MATLAB. If you code your embedded systems with MATLAB/SIMULINK, they get translated to c/cpp before compilation anyways.
I agree but this the task that I've been assigned to do :( 
`memcpy` is simply assigning the separate channels into the combined one, as in: h = 480; w = 640; ired = rand(h*w,1); igreen = rand(h*w,1); iblue = rand(h*w,1); d_v = zeros(h*w*3,1); d_v(1:w*h) = ired; d_v(w*h+1:2*w*h) = igreen; d_v(2*w*h+1:end) = iblue; In the C++ code, `d_v` (the RGB array) is defined as a flat 1D array, but MATLAB has powerful indexing so you simplify it as: d_v = zeros(h,w,3); d_v(:,:,1) = ired; d_v(:,:,2) = igreen; d_v(:,:,3) = iblue; or better yet: d_v = cat(3, ired, igreen, iblue): 
Thanks a lot ! :)
If this is part of a larger code base, one thing to look out for is the difference between C and MATLAB when it comes to the ordering of multi-dimensional arrays. C is know as row-major order, while MATLAB is column-major order: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order 
**Row- and column-major order** In computing, row-major order and column-major order are methods for storing multidimensional arrays in linear storage such as random access memory. The difference between the orders lies in which elements of an array are contiguous in memory. In a row-major order, the consecutive elements of a row reside next to each other, whereas the same holds true for consecutive elements of a column in a column-major order. While the terms allude to the rows and columns of a two-dimensional array, i.e. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/matlab/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
We are generating all of them. Probability is not a valid metric here. 
I think I'm looking for meshgrid, yup
Okay, I am familiar with meshgrid, but I would like help with plugging in the values of t and p at that element, into the function f
You don't need to generate all of them. For n=10 your method would require 10! or 3.6 million permutations to be generated. Recursive algorithm would require 2^10 + 2^9 + ... 1 ie about 2^11 or 2048 samples to be generated which is far less. In general 2^n grows far more slowly than n!.
I mean we are generating all of the "valid" ones. And I didn't give an explicit recipe for the generator which you can put as much complication you need. 
There's a much better method that I have outlined here https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/akxglt/need_help_writing_algorithm_to_create_specific/ef9ra2k?utm_source=reddit-android
I don't have access to your code, but I almost guarantee that the problem is because the initial slider value is set outside of the slider limits. I would initialize the sliders Value as the average of the sliders Min Max limits and see if that fixes it. 
You should give us more details about your expected output vs. actual output, and any error messages.
The expected output is a 1 row vector of two point answers (eg. f(x+h)-f(x)) here's the code I ran it with and the error. &gt;&gt; a = @ cos &gt;&gt;a = &gt;&gt;function_handle with value: &gt;&gt; @cos &gt;&gt; y = firstDeriv(a,.1,0,pi) Undefined function or variable 'y'. &gt;&gt;Error in firstDeriv (line 3) y = ([y,(fcnHandle(x+h) - fcnHandle(x))]
You're trying to append the results of the function to the previous contents of y, but y doesn't exist yet. Or in other words "Undefined function or variable 'y'". Before your loop, define an empty y: y=[]; It will probably complain about a variable growing inside a loop, since that's a much slower way of doing things in Matlab, but it should solve the error message you're seeing.
I think you are misunderstanding your assignment. There's no built-in binary format in Matlab. Maybe you are supposed to create your own 8-bit binary class? 
I feel like an idiot, that looks like it fixed it thank you so much. I had no idea you had to initialize like that in matlab.
What is the problem? Doesn't your code do what you want it to do? How does it "misbehave"? Have you tried using breakpoints? Try setting a breakpoint at the "while"-row and check the value of "r", "c" and "c~=4" manually. A hint: What happens to "r" and "c" when you input a new matrix?
Yea, I think I misunderstood the assignment. I made the output as binary = \[binaryDigit1, binaryDigit2, ... binaryDigit8\] and the script that the professor included with the assignment said that the problem tester was passed, so I think I was just supposed to use an array for binary. Thank you!
It's kind of an edge case. You basically have to initialize or define anything that is used on the right side of the equation. Anything on the left side will get defined on the fly, although initializing can help with speed.
"function test_integer_overflow(1)" this looks weird. What is the "1" doing there? When you define a function, you state your input variables there. 1 is a input value, not a variable. 
it should be "i" I just fixed it
Are you sure that you are using "fprintf" correctly? Try using something simpler like "disp". Maybe replace that line with "disp('m+i='); disp(m+i);"? Not as pretty but more robust. 
unfortunately that just gave me more errors &amp;#x200B; m+i= Error using + Integers can only be combined with integers of the same class, or scalar doubles. &amp;#x200B; Error in myfunction (line 4) disp(m+i);
I literally copy+pasted your code and ran it. Saved it as the function name (test_integer_overflow) and type in the command window: test_integer_overflow(1) and I didn't get an error.
Take the argument and use if the round function. x = round(user_input,N,'decimal') Where N is the number of decimals to round too.
Thanks!! we figured it out !! IF round(number,2) == number
What is the input values of P and T? Im assuming it is not an integer or it might be negative. When you type fh20(P,T), it wil try to create a matrix and index into position (P,T). You are just calculating a single value, get rid of the (P, T) in your equation. It should just be fh20=.....
You should disp. So it’s not the disp command but the operation of m+i that is erroring out. How are you calling your function? If not specified, matlab will just assume any number you create to be of double datatype. So you might like to cast i to int32 first.
Make sure to use the 'decimal' type, if someone where to enter 256.00, it would round that up.
You need to write it as two subconditions: elseif bmi &gt;16 &amp;&amp; bmi &lt;=18.5 ...
Sorry I haven't gotten to this earlier. What does your function f(t,p) look like?
Thank you that fixed it 
There might be more elegant solution to this .. but here’s one: x = montant * 100; If (x-floor(x))==0 Resultstat=true
So far what I'm using is meshgrid, that is giving the initial results I want, and I'm applying element wise operations, to construct a function s for every element position out of t and p. I have a differential expression as well, so im concatinating a column vector of NaN onto diff of some of my sub functions which are the differentials. So far I think this is what I want
That was just notation to implicate that the functions of p or t change within each element of their respective vectors and consequently would change within the matrix. 
Comme le mentionne l'énoncé, tu peux aussi y arriver en utilisant la fonction `fix` si tu utilise une multiplication avec. Quand tu as du code sur reddit, tu veux lidenter pour qu'il soit dans un bloc de code (comme résultat l'est en se moment). Je suis dispo par Slack pour se genre de question en passant. English: This is a student from my class (taught in French), hence the french reply. You can also use `fix` with a multiplication to get this kind of validation. I won't go into more details since this is a homework problem. 
Did you program the equations into solidworks? Can you just copy them from there? 
fH2O(P,T) needs P and T to be positive real integers. You can not use pressure and temperature values as reference locations in a matrix. Your code needs to be simply fH2O = ....
In the second line, remove (P,T) so it just says: fH20 = 1200 * exp ...
What are you trying to do? Why do you need the diff equations? Short answer is no, it is not designed to give you readable diff equations. You can maybe use linmod to linearize the model and get the state space matrices.
You shed much light my friend
thank you so much, i looked into and i got great results 
That makes things very difficult. What I would do is change the properties that graphene would have the largest impact. I would say increase the total capacitance, decrease the electrical permittivity, and decrease equivalent DC resistance. All of these can be done in the parameters tab or Stern tab of the supercapacitor block. Do you have data to compare with your simulation?
You may try the exchange file in the link. Provided if u do some preprocessing to ur data to the required format 
I get FGS/1+GCS for the reduced diagram as well. 
Okay, that's what I was wondering. I'm not sure how to "preprocess" my data. It's really just x and y values that form a concave down parabola. I couldn't understand from reading the file what I'm supposed to input exactly. Could you help me with this?
Hint:à nicer way to define transfert functions : s=tf('s') F=1/(1+10*s)/(2*s^2+s+3); This is much readable. Nb:I use p=tf('p') which works. I assume it also work with S but I did not try
It looks like you have done everything exactly correct, it is just a quirk of matlab. The difference comes from not simplifying the pole-zero pairs that result if you calculate the analytic feedback simplification. if you call sys2 = tf_F*tf_C*tf_G/(1 + tf_C*tf_G*tf_S); zpk(sys2) you get as a result 2000 s (s+34.14) (s+10) (s+5.858) (s^2 + s + 60) (s^2 + 5s + 100) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- s (s+34.14) (s+33.1) (s+16.83) (s+5.858) (s+1) (s^2 + 1.1s + 18.45) (s^2 + 5s + 100) (s^2 + 3.976s + 116.8) If you look carefully there are a number of identical poles and zeros that can be canceled. By default matlab does not cancel these, so you need to tell it explicitly to do this with the [minreal command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/minreal.html) sys2 = tf_F*tf_C*tf_G/(1 + tf_C*tf_G*tf_S); sys2_simple = minreal(sys2); zpk(sys2_simple) which will return 2000 (s+10) (s^2 + s + 60) -------------------------------------------------------------------- (s+33.1) (s+16.83) (s+1) (s^2 + 1.1s + 18.45) (s^2 + 3.976s + 116.8) which is the same as what the zpk(sys) returns.
I am honestly not sure what you are doing to generate the equations of motion. This problem seems pretty much ideal for Lagrangian mechanics, I would recommend looking into that first to generate the equations of motion in a more reliable way. Given the geometric nonlinearities in this problem I would expect there to be no closed form time solution to the dynamics. Once you get into nonlinear dynamics, there is very rarely problems with analytical solutions. You are likely going to need to use a numeric integrator like ode45 to find a particular solution. 
U can get program of the model... maybe u can figure out something from that...also Simscape solves using numerical method so those equation would be very different than textbook ones
Ok my guess is you have a matrix of data which is your x and y data You want to find the best fit curve by substituting the parameters u found from optimisation(e.g. Lsqcurvefit function from optimisation tool box) You will need the equation that models the curve(from the related papers or elsewhere) and write them in anonymous function form Next, u need to decide the parameters to be used, initialise them by assigning the values to them, and store them as array Next u will do the curve fitting and it will return the parameters required (Check the function's I've mentioned just now from documentation) Then u resubstitute the found values into model equation and plot it out again 
MATLAB can do Transfer function multiplication. If you have F,C,G, and S defined as transfer functions then you can just solve the feedback loop by hand such that YoverR = F*C*G/(1+C*G*S) If you type that exact equation into MATLAB it will compute the combined transfer function. Then you just need to use the step() function by typing step(YoverR) You were almost there. Keep it going. 
All your numbers are blank boxes on my screen. 
So you could look at the documentation for sum() and see if you can get rid of that loop completely. Otherwise you could just implement the definition of the Taylor series in a loop. What part of that is giving you trouble? 
its the predicting part that gets me. using the xi = 0 and h=1 values to find the values of the function @ x = 1
i think the way the function was represented in MATLAB is wrong. should i be like this? equation = [-0.1 -0.15 -0.5 -0.25 1.2]; ?
what do you mean sir? 
Basically, I would compare the rounded value and the orriginal: y=round(x*100)/100; Result = x==y;
Show us some code 
Try: y = dsolve('Dy = ((x*y + y^2)/(x^2)),'x') I don't have symbolic toolbox on this instance of MATLAB so I can't try myself
ty i found my mistake &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Hey somehow I've upvoted you 6 times. Reddit is a small world after all! Anyway, thanks for the answer, it is cell array. I didn't remember that you could directly initialize cells like that. The funny thing is that I wrote that I wrote that variable in my own code some times ago, but I haven't worked with matlab in a while.
How are you doing your upload? Are you using the built-in VideoReader function along with the readFrame function for each frame of the video? This should create the data cube for the video that you can process. 
In the first case, the answers are identical, since C is undetermined. In the second case, you've got three answers, each of which solves the equation. The third simply needs rewriting to be in a form you recognize; remember that hyperbolic trig functions can be written in terms of exponentials. You're doing the correct procedure, and getting the correct answers, just not in a form you recognize. You can double-check with another symbolic solver (like Wolfram|Alpha) if you'd like.
For a little bit of extra context, in earlier versions of Matlab (at least until 2015a), there weren't any string arrays so cell arrays were the proper alternative.
Thank you!
Anything involving `{}` is likely to be a cell. If it is done the first time the variable appears, like here, it will always be a cell. Up until recently pretty much anything with `{}` was a cell. However, `{}` indexing is now supported for indexing (but not creating) the new string array type. It basically means "index the string array as though it were a cell array of strings".
That's very good information thank you. I don't have any data to compare with, but I was thinking I could compare the graphs I have from the normal supercapacitor to the graphs I will get once I manage to change the supercap into a graphene-based one.
Would you know how to do that by hand? If you derived Taylor polynomial, how would you use it to estimate a new value? 
That's usually a convenient way to represent a polynomial, yes. 
First off, thanks so much for taking your time to respond and try to help out! I'm gonna be completely honest, though. I didn't understand much of what you said. Sorry :( Here are the things specifically I didn't understand. "...by substituting the parameters you found from optimization." From what optimisation? Which parameters? Also, what optimization tool box are you referring to? "You will need the equation that models the curve...write in anonymous function form." Are you referring to the Lorentzian function? What's "anonymous form." "Return the parameters required." Do you mean what the lorentzian function specifically returns.( a value)? "resubstitute the found values into model equation." So, if the my curve fit spits out a value, I plug this single value back into the function? &amp;#x200B; Sorry...as you can tell, I'm pretty dumb when it comes to any type of curve fitting. I really have no experience with this stuff or with the Lorentzian. If it's too much trouble to clear up the above, I completely understand! No worries. Thanks so much though!
You could try to fit a polynomial to your data and then evaluate it at Y = 300
One way to do it would be: Find the first index where y&gt;=00 last index where y&lt;=300 interpolate between those two indices using interp1 https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/find.html https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp1.html Good luck!
^this. If you have the curve fitting toolbox, just use cftool to do this interactively. 
Did you read through the documentation for [hist](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hist.html)? The matlab documentation is really great, and even includes examples. It looks like your confusion is partly coming from whether or not you have to loop over hist and call it once per data point or if you can just give it a vector of data to plot. Check out the documentation to see how this command will behave in those two cases in order to decide what you want for your application. 
So, neither of those will get you what you want. First, `hist` is old and being phased out. It has been replaced by [histogram](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.histogram.html) which is way better. Use that instead. Second, `hist` and `histogram` both take vectors of data. It wants all the data at once, and then it plots it as a histogram. A histogram of a single data point isn't very interesting. Finally, you'll want to learn about [logical indexing](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/02/20/logical-indexing-multiple-conditions/) is order to quickly grab all of the rows in which people have cancer. No need to loop at all. Logical indexing takes a little bit of mind-power upfront to get comfortable with, but it's just such a powerful feature, time spent learning it is well worth it. 
Yep, the `int` command accepts numbers, symbolic numbers, variables, expressions, or functions (including expressions and functions with infinities) as lower/upper bounds. https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/int.html
It's there a reason you need it to be in a loop? (ie. Is it happening in an iterative process and you need intermediate results?) Otherwise you can do single(sum(values)) where values is your array and it'll be much faster
I actually just came across logical indexing and it is really impressive! Do you know if there is anything similar in Python? I do a lot of data organizing that would really benefit from being able to quickly breakdown sets of information into smaller lists of interest. But either way, I was able to figure out the histograms I needed to complete my assignments using logical indexing. The only thing I am unsure about now is although the original array had 3 columns, I could apply logical indexing to the third column and then plot the histogram and get the output I wanted. I am wondering how I would go about plotting histograms for a column of interest? For instance, in the assignment I was working on, I needed to plot the histogram of the first column based on the logical indexing of the third. If I wanted to plot the histogram for the second column and not the first, how would I go about doing that?
yeah im just learning MATLAB I realize theres easier ways to do it but i wannna do it with the most basic functions given. 
In that case I would move your single function to outside your loop and it looks fine.
Thanks for the comment, although I'm not sure if this is what I'm looking to have something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/7QozUUD), where t is the current time of the simulation. I believe your suggestion would still give a constant for the lower limit?
Forgot to mention I want the area under the curve to be revolved. I tried using the cylinder function but it didn't turn out well
You can check out this too [https://free-thesis.com/product/image-fusion-using-deep-learning/](https://free-thesis.com/product/image-fusion-using-deep-learning/)
Well I am sorry that my explanation seems to confuse you even more. I'll try my best to make it clear as possible. Assume u have a set of values X and Y I can't recall the equation that characterise the lorentzian curve look like. However in this scenario u just assume that u have looked up a equation that is Y = a*x/b+c;or whatever equation that has some constants (a,b,c here in this example) that can be adjusted to make the equation above to fit the data So, U will need to provide the initial values for these constants,like a= 0.11 b=0.22 c=0.3 x_0 =[a b c] This is the initial guess for each round iteration in finding the optimal values that could fit the curve as best as possible, I think papers that describe ur work will mention about the values for these constants. Next u need to write the lorentzian model equation like this Model = @(x_0,X) a*X/b+c; Now you lookup the optimisation function (u need to install optimisation toolbox for matlab, a quick search for it will do), either a suitable one for your case (I used lsqcurvefit function last time and your instructor may ask something different) Now u just use the code like this x_optimal = lsqcurvefit(Model,x_0,X,Y) Where Model is the equation model u should knew X,Y are your data x_0 is the initial guess x_optimal is the best value you found for this optimisation process which is also has same format as x_0, which is [a b c] too but they are the optimised values Once you obtained the optimal a,b,c values, you may now plugin the values into the equation and plot it out Plot(X,Model(x_optimal,X))
i dont know how to apply taylor series to a polynomial but i know to some trigo functions. i would like to know sir
The easiest way is probably to make your own kmeans implementation. Mathworks have implementations to get you started. Make a wavelet class. Make functions that calculate the distance between two wavelets and the average of a vector of wavelets. Update the kmeans code to work on that. 
I don’t really understand the question, but I’ll try to answer anyway: One of the most important things in programming is information hiding. You want your methods etc. to only have access to the information they need. This reduces complexity and helps create abstraction. Global variables breaks this, and so they are bad (not never-use bad, but bad). Putting lots of data in a struct and passing that struct to every class and function creates a de-facto global variable, so it is also bad for the same reasons. “Code Complete” is a good book on the subject. 
If performance (speed and size) is paramount, code will generally run faster if you use globals. However, readability and maintainability suffer. If the code is a team effort then its usually better to use declarative structure to control scope.
? It looks like he just has a flair that says +6, not that you've upvoted him 6 times.
&gt;x\_optimal = lsqcurvefit(Model,x\_0,X,Y) Wow, thank you so much. You're the best! I'm going to try all of this out and see how far I can get. Thank you TONS!
In general, try to avoid global as ode maintainance is then very difficult. I do use structures that gather data for specific subject and use them as parameter of function. Functio having their own workspace, you can then easily trace the stack and see where the data comes from. 
Thank you point taken. What’s ode? I read this and think ordinary differential equation but know that can’t be it
function [] = falldetection (video) [path,name,ext] = fileparts(mfilename('D:\UNI 2018-2019\Fall-Detection-master\Fall-Detection-master\videos')); vid = vision.VideoFileReader(sprintf('%s\\videos\\%s',path,vidname));
Glad that helped! If this worked for one pair of XY data, and still have a lot of data to be processed, You may do a loop run, and save the x_optimal in an array and you can plot out whichever curve as defined by that x_optimal you want 
Maybe you could use scatter3() to plot a grid of 3D points with color that depends on F? I’m unsure if it will be possible to see anything in it though. Can you use a series of surface plots, one for each “interesting” z-value, instead? 
Thank you! 
As already said, you need to use colors for your data for sure. Otherwise it is not really possible to show anything with a 4-D data. As functions, you can use scatter3 and surf. If you have a structured grid, it is easier to use surf. If you have long arrays for all dimensions, scatter3 is the go-to function. 
You could also consider using an animation to loop through a variable. For example you can do imagesc(x,y,F(:,:,z(k))) and then loop over the values of z and creating a movie
If you don't understand the math you're trying to do, then your problem isn't with Matlab. You should talk to your teacher about it. Once you understand the math, you can use Matlab to apply it, but Matlab cannot do something for you if you don't understand it yourself.
It's fundamentally difficult to show data with more than 2 dimensions in a way that is enlightening to the viewer. Getting your point across in situations like this requires some creativity in your data visualization. Exactly what's best depends on the situation, your audience, and what point you want to make. Often it's best to show multiple plots of lower-dimensional "slices" through your data, or other figures computed from the data which reduce its dimension. The point is, there's no magic way to make a 2D screen show 4D data to a person who's brain is wired for 3D at best. You have to figure out some other way to show what you want. 
In general, global variables are bad. Don't use them. When you run into a situation where one is appropriate, you'll know it pretty intuitively. Otherwise, avoid them entirely. They lead to a lot of poor habits and bizarre program structure that will make life difficult later on. 
Given the other missing letters in the post, I think they mean "code maintenance" 
Yep, sorry for poor spelling. My fingers are definitely not compatible with my phone. 
Everytime I've done this I've only done it one way. What you do is discretize the space along 1 axis and then create N 2D mesh plots. Here's a great article by stackoverflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9960456/matlab-need-to-make-a-4d-plot-3d-colour-color
Try also slices() this is also used to represent 4d data, X,Y,Z and V for a value at the specific coordinate.
Scatter 2D plot with the markers varying in color and size. The other option of scatter3 with varying colors would be different to read and interpret for the viewer.
If you don't care about the one of the columns of data in your input, why not just remove it and run your clustering on the data you care about? 
Thanks for all the advice! I realize that each surface has to have one fixed variable in order to create a surface. Otherwise, the colored scatters are just meaningless data in the plot. I have created some 3 slices to represent my data instead of using surface function. Resolved. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
thanks. This is useful!
Yep. This is what I did at the end.
This is possible, but you'll have to use Mex (I believe the newest version of MATLAB also has a different, hopefully easier to use API for C++). Not sure where your troubles arose when trying to use mex files, but in short your main function will be replaced by: `void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]){` `// call your other function here` `}` &amp;#x200B; Your output will be placed into the plhs mxArray. And of course, you'll have to make sure you've included the mex header. &amp;#x200B; A few things to note if you haven't discovered them already, when you compile the mex file in matlab, you'll need to run mex -setup and make sure it's using the c++ compiler. Also, the mex files are OS dependent. You'll have to recompile it every time you switch operating systems. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
C/C++ programs have `main` function. MEX-files have `mexFunction` gateway function. Here is an example of a MEX function that receives a numeric array of doubles (of any size or shape), and returns an incremented array by 5. #include "mex.h" static void plusfive(const size_t len, const double *x, double *y) { for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i) y[i] = x[i] + 5; } void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]) { if (nrhs != 1 || nlhs &gt; 1) mexErrMsgIdAndTxt("mex:error", "wrong number of arguments"); if(!mxIsDouble(prhs[0]) || mxIsComplex(prhs[0]) || mxIsSparse(prhs[0])) mexErrMsgIdAndTxt("mex:error", "input is a dense real double array"); const mwSize ndims = mxGetNumberOfDimensions(prhs[0]); const mwSize *dims = mxGetDimensions(prhs[0]); const mwSize numel = mxGetNumberOfElements(prhs[0]); const double *input = mxGetPr(prhs[0]); plhs[0] = mxCreateNumericArray(ndims, dims, mxDOUBLE_CLASS, mxREAL); double *output = mxGetPr(plhs[0]); plusfive(numel, input, output); } 
Give this a read. [C++ Mex Functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/c-mex-functions.html) There are a couple tutorials that basically do what you want.
As others said, MEX files are the way to go, but if you want to migrate some MATLAB code to C++, you can use [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) library in C++, it can help you to translate more easily some functions, and compile your c++ files with a syntax similar to MATLAB. Personal suggestion, be patient and don't skip any step related to mex files, it's a cumbersome the first time, but the results are worth it
I'm not sure what that image is. Is that Matlab? It looks like something else. In Matlab, you can perform symbolic integration with symbolic limits as such syms x t result = int(x^2, x, cos(t), sin(t)) result = sin(t)^3/3 - cos(t)^3/3 
&gt; Do you know if there is anything similar in Python? Numpy can do logical indexing. See [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.1/user/basics.indexing.html#boolean-or-mask-index-arrays)
My personal preference is to create a C++/CLI project compiled as a .Net assembly rather than a mex function. You can then reference that assembly from Matlab using NET.AddAssembly().
It was developed for a rather broad purpose actually. Magic.

Please format your code properly. Please tell us what you expect to happen, and what actually happens.
What I expect to happen is that it will ouput x and y points that I can then use for plotting. What is actually happening is that its not working. 
Format your code so we can read it. Highlight the actual x and y variables. And give more information than "this is not working". If it's not working, either your output doesn't match your expectations or there is an error, in which case you can investigate the error.
It makes documentation disappear. 
1. Put four spaces in front of your code in order to escape reddit formatting. 2. What's the problem? I understand your task, but where are you stuck?
You can separate the rgb components and check their histograms at the same time you are using your Webcam. Or you can take a picture with your Webcam and check. Just to see if it is really a problem in your Webcam sensor. 
Write each equation in the form of sum of coefficients times unknowns equals constant. The coefficients from each equation make up each row of the matrix. Then multiply the inverse of the matrix by a column vector of the constants from each equation.
The documentation should explain it. What is unclear?

OMG thank you!!! That’s exactly answers my dilemma!!! I wish my work gave a more formal training for MATLAB 
Potentially has to do with compression of the video files and how your code is interpreting it. Most RGB cameras work using [Bayer filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter), meaning the majority of your pixels are covered with a green filter. It's therefore very unlikely that all the green pixels of the camera are all simultaneously screwed up, but none of the rest are. Video and images are often compressed differently. If it's a raw feed from the camera you are inputting to your script, you may need to convert it first so that it is interpreted the same way as your saved jpeg file (and therefore how your code seems to be intended to run). It's likely that there is some existing converter within matlab. 
To confirm, are these your files: function [x,y] = trial(m,n) x = (m*3) - n; y = (7*m) + (2*n); end for k=1:5 i=i+1 for n=1:10 j=j+1 [x,y]=trial(k,n); xx(i,j)=x; yy(i,j)=y; end end 
In MATLAB, the operators `\` ([mldivide](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html)) and `/` ([mrdivide](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mrdivide.html)) are related to each other by the equation: B/A = (A'\B')' This is a simple result of [transpose properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose#Properties).
In Matlab, i = j = sqrt(-1) Also, assuming i and j have been overwritten with regular integer values, why are you incrementing them rather than use k and n (or simple functions of k and n) since those are your loop indices? 
Why not using an fft? 
Essentially, i and j was to represent each iteration. xx and yy were to represent the corresponding tables of values. So table xx would represent each value of x. I have just rewritten the code removing i and j and this seems to work better. for m=1:5 m=m+1; for n=1:10 n=n+1; [x,y]=trial(m,n); xx(m,n)=x; yy(m,n)=y; end end Is this the most efficient way of writing the code?
I'm getting confused because you're writing: for m=1:5 m=m+1 But m is already being incremented by the for loop. So I'm confused as to what you're trying to do. Are you trying to let m=1,2,3,4 then 5? Or 1,3,then 5?
I look at this guy all the time. I don't have digital signal processing toolbox, but maybe this will lead you in the right direction? He has two really good functions: 1) isignal 2) ifilter there are a low of optional arguments, but just type "isignal ( time\_1d, signal\_1d)" Maybe this is helpful, maybe not, but I thought I should at least say something.
Are you merely multiplying the coordinates by a rotation matrix? You can just multiply the matrices together with no loop at all
There's a lot of good info on assessing your computational performance on the page here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/performance-and-memory.html For a quick and dirty, you can run the line once with 'tic' before the line and 'toc' after to see the base performance rate of the function or operation. Alternatively, you can use the 'run and time' button under the editor tab, and see what the major bottlenecks in the program are. I'm not sure what your exact issue is from your description, but one thing I've found is to always make sure to pre-allocate your variables - this can have a huge impact on performance. If you are adding elements or dimensions to your variable incrementally, it's going to run very slow. It sounds like this is what you're doing, which could be taking up the majority of the time if you are changing the variable sizing every singly iteration. Secondarily, see if you can modify your code to use matrix operations rather than non-linear functions. It may not be feasible in your case, but it is in many more cases than people initially think, particularly in fitting. Again, I don't know exactly what you're trying to do from your description, but take a step back and see if you could possibly implement it in a way that doesn't require non-linear functions. 
I think trapz is what you are looking for
Well, this is essentially a brute force algorithm, in which I have an outer loop which chooses between a small number of permutations of the rows of a matrix and an inner loop which does 2\^20 operations on that permuted matrix. In fact, I wouldn't even run this algorithm, except it seemed that it only took 3 hours to run it with no permutations, and there is some utility to just running an algorithm without thinking about how to make it faster. The day or two of execution that I was expecting it to take was worth not putting any more effort into it. But I am curious about why one iteration through the outer loop took so much longer than another. Since it isn't the time of the permuting itself, my next guess is that there is some matlab magic going on. Specifically, one of the steps in my inner loop included W'\*D\*W(Pr(j,:),:), which is now W'\*D\*Wtemp. My guess is that matlab was able to optimize this in cases where the answer ended up being self-adjoint.
&gt;But I am curious about why one iteration through the outer loop took so much longer than another. It's fairly common in matlab that iterations are not simple multiplications of the single operation/function time. It primarily has to do with how variables are loaded into the memory, though to be honest I'm not much of an expert in that beyond knowing 'it's not idealized'. In general, abiding to the two rules I outlined above will mostly avoid that creep into non-linear/exponential execution time that occurs during a high number of iterations. 
If you try your code, you will see that you are only left with a single channel (the red channel), which is black and white. The piece of information is in your comment: &gt;remove anything that is blue **and** green what you are currently implementing is: &gt;remove anything that is blue **or** green
Your approach to zeroing out a column is right, but RGB is the wrong colour space to do it in, because there’s no yellow channel. Convert the RGB values to CMYK, remove yellow, and then convert it back to RGB. Here’s an example for the first step https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/Misc/rgb2cmyk.m
Ah, that makes sense, I will try that approach. Thank you!
Ah okay, thank you!
You need to combine red and green to get yellow. https://imgur.com/dODrQe7 So you need to find where the pixels in the red and green channels are equal. So something like: Yellow = img(:,:,1) == img(:,:,2) 
You're trying to do numerical quadrature integration. When you have a function that you want to integrate, you want to use the integral() function. If you only have a list of function values, you'd use trapz to do trapezoidal integration. 
That's for sampled function values, not a continuously defined function. 
As a follow up, anonymous functions are defined like `f = @(x, y) x + y;` Where `x` and `y` are the inputs
m=1,2,3,4,5 I have removed the m=m+1 as this made xx a 6x11 table instead. This process now seems to work but it my actual code doesn't work for a separate reason. I might make a new thread about that tomorrow as wording it may prove difficult. Appreciate the extra observation though, was getting tunnel vision with the code. 
Can you write out the data and process it later? It's been a little while since I used the optimization stuff in any real depth, but I remember there being a way to call an auxiliary function that you could use to write the data out.
Finding a solution when you have infinitely many is not the hard part. This is because solutions in linear algebra lie in subspaces so there is no algebraic constraints between variables in the solution. In other words, you can choose coordinates arbitrarily for any free variables and the resulting equations will still be uniquely solvable. The thing you typically need to worry about is the situation that the equations have no solution at all. This can be detected with elimination but computing the next best thing (a vector which minimizes the residual) requires different techniques. Google for "Pseudo-inverse" or "least squares minimization" to find methods for doing this. 
Thank you for answering. Could I not just take the determinant of my matrix A inorder to check for the possibility of no solution? I.e: a if-statement which says that "if det(A)=0 then terminate, insert new matrix"? Since I was tasked with using gaussian elimination for solving a linear system: Ax=b , I don't think they expect anything fancy. Since I'm supposed to program this with only the understanding of gaussian elimination baiscally. 
ok
If you want help, please format your code properly. [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting)
Sorry! I am not able to make it look like block of code! Could you help me out, how could I do it?
You can also stand to gain a significant speedup by transposing your matrix. MATLAB uses column-major order which means loops are up to 30% faster when iterating over columns of a matrix as opposed to rows. The larger the matrix, the larger the improvement in performance. tldr: never ever loop over rows in MATLAB if you can loop over columns instead. 
Done! I guess! Please check now!
You know what. It is magical 
I need two have vectors (r and v in my code) with x and y components that I can call up for future iterations. 
Ah, didnt realize he was looking for the exact solution. 
For mxn matrices with m&gt;n, the determinant will always be 0. So the test for det(A)=0 only works for m&lt;n. In this case I’d also suggest the least squares method. You may need to rearrange the rows if your diagonal elements during the elimination become zero. Google gauss pivot strategy. The pseudo code for gauss (and the algorithm itself) should be straight forward. (:
Yeah you could, but that's like printing out a memo and sending it by fax instead of using email. 
Haha, I usually exit my house by a ropeladder, don't judge.
Maybe what you are searching for is this: [https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/msgbox.html](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/msgbox.html)
The subscript mist be a real, positive integer. for i=0:1:10 for j=0:10:100 [x,y]=func(i,j) xx(i,j)=x yy(i,j)=y end end Gives you one index that is not a real, positive integer for bot i and j. Try taking the zero'th element of a vector of length n, you might be able to figure it out now :)
Ok I see, I've tried inputting i=i+1 and j=j+1 in their respective for loops but this seems to output a slightly different table. Is this correct?
The thing is; you can't refer to a zero'th element; so both i and j should start at 1 (or any positive real integer). my solution would be to put for i = 1:1:11 for j=1:10:101 [x,y]=func(i-1,j-1) xx(i,j)=x yy(i,j)=y end end &amp;#x200B; That way you run from the first to the last value you want You could also put for i = 1:1:11 a = some expression with i; for j=1:10:101 b = some expression with j; [x,y]=func(a,b); xx(i,j)=x; yy(i,j)=y; end end with in this case a = i -1 an b = j-1
In Matlab, i = j =sqrt(-1) so it's a bad idea to use them as loop indices. &gt; for i=0:1:10 &gt; for j=0:10:100 &gt; [x,y]=func(i,j) &gt; &gt; xx(i,j)=x &gt; yy(i,j)=y &gt; &gt; end &gt; end &gt; Essentially, for xx the value in cell (2,4) will be the x value produced from the function that has inputs i=1 and j=10. No. xx(2, 4) will contain the value of the function when i=2 and j=4. &gt;I believe that this works for any simple function, but my function produces 'Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals' even though my function produces a singular x and y value. Right, because on your first loop iteration you're trying to assign a value to xx(0, 0). Zero is not a real positive integer. In Matlab, array indices must be positive integers, because the first element in an array A is the A(1), not A(0). &gt;Any advice on where my error could be, or would it be best to ask a question regarding my function instead? Your error is exactly where Matlab says your error is. It definitely gave you the exact line number where the error occurred. &gt;edit: have updated code to: &gt; &gt; xx=zeros(5,10); &gt; yy=zeros(5,10); &gt; i=0; j=0; &gt; for m=1:5 &gt; i=i+1; &gt; for n=1:10 &gt; j=j+1; &gt; [x,y]=trial(m,n); &gt; xx(i,j)=x; &gt; yy(i,j)=y; &gt; end &gt; end Why do you need i and j here? They seem totally unnecessary. You can do every thing with just m and n. You're getting an array of the wrong size because you increment j every time. Your inner loop is running 50 times, so j ends up at 50.
MATLAB can allocate larger size of your matrix dynamically as needed. Within the inner loop, for every iteration of m, you repeat it 10 times, thus you get 5 \* 10 = 50 columns. Any reason you need 2 loops to do this? without knowing your actual goal, I'm guessing this might be what you are interested in doing: &amp;#x200B; `m = (1:5)'` `n = 1:10` `x=(m*3)-n` `y=(7*m)+(2*n)`
I have tried replicating this: xx=zeros(4,19); yy=zeros(4,19); zz=zeros(4,19); % i=0; % j=0; for i=0.25:0.25:1 %range of different i values %i=i+1; for j=0.05:0.05:1 %range of different j values % j=j+1; [x,y] =function(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,i-0.25,j-0.05); xx(i,j)=x/80; yy(i,j)=i; zz(i,j)=j; end end Which is a very simplified version of my code, with a simplified version of the function: function [x,y]=trial(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,m,n) x=(m*3)-n+a+b+c+d-e-f-g; y=(7*m)+(2*n)-d-e-f-g+a+b+c; end
Well I'm trying to produce 2 tables (one for each function output). My goal is to have rows representing the 1:5 values and columns representing the 1:10 values. This would mean that the 2nd column of the x-output table will contain all the values of x when the m variable is equal to 2 constantly and the values of x would change as n increases (from 1 to 10) down the column.
Looking to have 2 for loops that will run through a function to fill a table. These for loops will be non integer i.e. for a=0.25:0.25:2 for b=0.1:0.1:2 function will run these i.e. [x,y]=func(a,b) Then place the values into a table such that xx(a+1,b+1)=x end end This for loops seem to work for integers i.e. c=1:5. How do I overcome this?
For k=1:3 Use index k/10 to do stuff end Something like this?
Or just pre-define your vector Vec = 0.1:0.1:2 For k=1:length(vec) Do stuff with vec(k) end
How would you do it using pencil and paper?
Thank you, solved the issue
So since ln(1-x)=SUM\[(x\^k)/k,k,1,Inf\], Don't I plug in -0.9 to x and 1 to infinity to k? So, (-0.9\^1)+(-0.9\^2)/2+(-0.9\^3)/3...
Protip: work your problems out by hand before touching Matlab, and the result becomes very clear. 
Thanks for the suggestion. I’ll try it by hand first. But I’m also asked how many terms I would need for the series and the error. I’m not sure how to compute those by hand. Any idea?
You can define your axes separately from your loop indices. So xx(m, n) = func(a(m), b(n)) or something like that. Array indices are always positive integers. 
Are you using a symbolic function?

I haven't used errorbars that much, but if you do `get(D)`, all of the properties of the line will be printed to the console. By scrolling through those, you might find one that sounds like it would correspond to the errorbars, which you can then work on extracting in a similar way to what you have done for the x and y data. 
You can open the inspector and use the edit tool to select various figure elements and the inspector will update. Alternatively you can select the error bars and use gco in the command line. 
Error of a truncated Taylor series is something you should have been taught in class. From that you should be able to figure out how many terms you need and what the error will be. 
Have you tried [this?](https://screenshots.firefox.com/FSzoRCeb9jWUXEv3/www.mathworks.com#)
Find the number of lines that have equal slopes
I don't know if this is the best place for this question... It seems to me the answer is zero parallel lines. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2Q31sjeNnk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2Q31sjeNnk)
Yeah, we did go over that. I'm just not sure how truncation error is related to the problem I'm working on...
i saw the video and zero might seem like a good answer as lines that intersect are called dinstict lines and are not parallel. on Fano's geometry there are 7 points and 7 lines and they all intersect so that might seem to be it. All though on my homework i have 1 more try to submit the answer and if it's not zero then i get it wrong lol.
I think you just answered the question for yourself... you know the definition, so ask yourself: can parallel lines intersect?
Wrong sub?
nope parallel lines dont intersect, the answer was zero, thanks for help
I will reply here. 1. You are on the right track with your reply to my post. Just turn that into a for loop and you are done. If you get stuck post up and I will help, I worked it out but won't just put it up here. 2. If that's all your professor said about the error, here's how I would do that. * Calculate the 'exact' value using matlab. log(x) is the ln function in matlab * Write the for loop that sums what you did by hand * Keep making the ending number of that loop bigger, comparing the exact and approximate solutions. You'll eventually see the difference between them doesn't get any smaller, no matter how many iterations you run * If you know anything about the way computers represent numbers, think about how that ties to your minimum error
Thanks again. Actually, we weren't taught about how to use a for loop. Mind sharing a resource that I can review it on?
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html Also try matlab cody. 
Do you mean if F is symbolic? Yes Do you mean if diff is symbolic? Also yes
Thanks. So the question is to approximate ln(1.9) with 10-digit of accuracy using two taylor series 1) ln(1-x)=-Sum\[(x\^k)/k,k,1,Inf\] To be honest, this is my very first assignment with MATLAB and I'm completely lost. I'm looking at this link and was wondering if I should do something similar: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/410482-i-need-help-with-a-taylor-series-approximation-of-ln-1-x](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/410482-i-need-help-with-a-taylor-series-approximation-of-ln-1-x)
Here are what I have so far. [https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/aooq1g/taylor\_series\_approximation\_and\_error/](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/aooq1g/taylor_series_approximation_and_error/)
You could have kept this in your old post! These are good attempts though. Let's look at Trial 1 first. Your biggest problem here is that a \`for\` loop can't go to infinity. Your computer doesn't really have a way to represent infinity numerically. Your other problems are that starting at zero is causing a division by zero, and the (k+1) on your left hand side is problematic. x=-0.9; N=10; for k=1:1:N terms(k)=-((x\^k)/k); end &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Also, matlab doesn't recognize the function ln. Log is the natural log function in matlab. Confusing, I know.
Couple of points: **Trial 1:** 1. You can't use `N=Inf` and use it in a loop, MATLAB loops don't work that way. For more on `for` loops: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_prog/loop-control-statements.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/loop-control-statements.html) 2. The rest should otherwise if you use any finite value for `N`. I start with your second trial which is more toward complete: **Trial 2:** 1. The function for natural logarithm is `log` in MATLAB. `log10` is for log base 10. more info here: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/log.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/log.html) 2. You can't start your summation with something non-zero: `series_sum = -0.9` 3. A spelling mistake: `differnce = abs(difference);` 4. The final summation has a negative sign in it. So when you calculate the final sum inside the for loop it should be (-1) multiplied with it. So when you calculate the difference, you should add the `series_sum` to `target_equation` and keep the absolute value as `difference`, right? I have fixed your trial 2: `x = 0.9;` `target_equation = log(1-x);` `series_sum = 0;` `difference = abs(target_equation - series_sum);` `threshold = 1*10^-10;` `count = 0;` `while difference &gt; threshold` `fprintf('count = %d, sum = %f\n', count, -series_sum);` `count = count + 1;` `series_sum = series_sum + (x^count)/count;` `difference = abs(target_equation + series_sum);` `end`
An integer/float already is in binary, but a float is just powers of 2. First convert it to scientific notation, so 50.2 becomes 5.02E1. Then convert that to base 2, so 5.02 =&gt; 2\^2 + 1.02 = 2\^2 + 2\^0 + 0.02, etc.
Why are you doing this in such a peculiar way? can you not just use the quadratic equation and enter the relevant values for "a" "b" and "c"?
thanks
Is this what you were trying to do? I wasn't 100% sure
yeah instead of C=11 ,i wrote C=11-y .Where y is my matrix 
Thank you so much for your help. However, I expected the result to be somewhat similar to the actual value of ln(1.9), but they are not. Why is this the case?
Okay, change the value of x accordingly. Here the value I have taken is 0.9. So you are getting the value of ln(0.1). Put x=-0.9. You will find your answer.
This is just for X and Y data, my code is already doing this.
Ok that is helpful, I've done this. This was the output: h = gco h = ErrorBar with properties: Color: [0 0 1] LineStyle: '-' LineWidth: 0.5000 Marker: 'o' XData: [1×1910 double] YData: [1×1910 double] XNegativeDelta: [1×0 double] XPositiveDelta: [1×0 double] YNegativeDelta: [1×1910 double] YPositiveDelta: [1×1910 double] How can I get the YPositiveDelta data now?
Done! Simply with "get(h,'YPositiveDelta')" Thank you!
&gt;fprintf('count = %d, sum = %f\\n', count, -series\_sum); I see. Thank you. Could you explain what this line does?
&gt;for i = 1:N x(n+1) = some\_formula + x(n) end Thanks for your help. I'm not really sure what this code does. Could you explain what it does and why I need to add it to the codes above?
Thanks for your help again. Where are the x(n+1) and x(n) coming from? Also, I have a question about this code: for i = 1:N x(n+1) = some_formula + x(n) end So with this code, am I adding (-0.9/1)+(-0.9^2/2)+(-0.9^3/3)...?
For future reference, you should also be able to use dot notation to access these properties. When you have a handle to the object, `h`, you can access its properties directly with, for example, `h.YNegativeDelta`. Glad you're all sorted! Do come back if you need more help later!
Notice your MATLAB workspace, it is printing current count and the approaching sum. 
That seems like a strange thing to do
This is not a numerically stable solution.
Look at this. Custom hardware is not supported anymore since R2018a. https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-real-time/obsolete-drivers.html
check the dimensions of your signal and noise vectors to verify that they match
Thanks, this I am aware of. This is only I/O hardware, not the computer itself. 
This is strange, because I would have expected by disabling graphics mode, you would at least have seen something on the screen that indicates what the issue could be (even if it's gibberish, that could hint to a crash in the RTOS). Does the screen remain completely black/blank even if you disable graphics mode? &amp;#x200B; If that's the case, I can only suspect that your motherboard/chipset is too "new" or "advanced" for the Simulink Real-Time RTOS. &amp;#x200B; Random example: If the motherboard has USB 3.0 enabled and you have something plugged into a USB 3.0 port, that could cause issues. &amp;#x200B; If you go back and take a look at the R2017b documentation (last release where DIY targets were supported), there is a page about BIOS configurations ([link here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2017b/xpc/gs/bios-settings.html)). You could take a look at that and see if you can maybe change some settings in your BIOS to get it to boot. 
have you tried running it yet? Pretty sure using an elseif will force it to evaluate only once, on the first condition in your example. But for real, just run it
Whoops you're right, I just ran it and got w=2 THANK YOU!!
The screen shows the RTDOS loading, then it freezes and then goes blank, but the monitor is still green, meaning there is an active signal. I try to ping, no luck. I suspect you are correct that the motherboard isn't compatible. However, I also tried a R5400 which is from like 2007 and that didn't work as well. I'll have the check the BIOS, good idea. 
Yes While x&gt;1 Insert code here End This will continue until “x&gt;1” is false
Thank you so much!
Did you add a breakpoint as part of debug? It is usually indicated by a red circle on the line of code. select clear all breakpoints on the ribbon in the script editor. 
Maybe there is some licence issue...
Restart the PC try again. Uninstall reinstall and try again. Check if your firewall is killing it maybe? 
Try launching it from terminal like this: &lt;full filepath/matlab&gt; -nosplash
Maybe copy the code to another word processor like word or something and then paste it back? Or try saving the live script as a .m and then see if you can remove the section break and then change it back to .mlx. I'm not sure I understand why the backspace isn't working, how do you have a section break at the top of your script? Hope this helps. 
to get them on the same set of axes, you should use the 'hold on;' command, after plotting the first one, or after creating the figure or subplot. so like figure; hold on; plot( datax1, datay1, 'b.'); plot( datax2, datay2, 'r.'); &amp;#x200B; 'r.' will make red dots, 'b.' will make blue dots. fort points there's also .xhso\^ for dot, x's, hexagon, etc etc. Hopefully hold on is all you need, also different variable names for the two sets to plot at the same time
I have no idea if the syntax for Freemat would be identical, but in Matlab, you could either use `hold on`, or you could use the plot command with multiple x-y vectors.
Thanks! This worked just fine. 
I believe that Matlab is 95% the same, at least that's what my instructor said. We use Freemat since he doesn't want us to pay for Matlab. And 'hold on' did actually work.
Hmm... I'm stuck. My professor did suggest using if- and while- statements. Perhaps it's easier that way?
That sucks you don't have a school license available. If you want to continue with free Matlab-like programs beyond this class, I would suggest ditching Freemat (which looks like it was abandoned by the creator 6 years ago) for Octave which is more well-known and still actively supported. 
Where are you stuck? Can you post the code you have so far, and explain 1. The behavior you intend for it to have 2. The behavior you are seeing 3. Why you think 1 and 2 aren’t the same 
I think we use Freemat because my instructor got word that some Universities are tired of paying for the license and don't use it anymore so he doesn't want us to learn something we won't use later. We have Matlab on the school computers, but obviously you have to be at school to use it. Its more of an introduction to coding rather than a main focus. Its not even 5% of the class. Just the plots for our lab reports. PH 211 is Freemat, and PH 212 begins to delve into Python, Octave, etc.
To further clarify: &amp;#x200B; I use a set time step value of 1s with a simulation duration of 10800s. So this block should reduce its output by quite a bit during this time. However 120 is the Signal that gets calculated for T\_DM' in the first simulation step and it stays constant until the end of the simulation, despite dT\_DM being a negative number. &amp;#x200B; I'm looking forward to any helful advice!
for i = 1:N x(n+1) = some\_formula + x(n) end &amp;#x200B; I've been trying to look for examples to follow, but no luck. I'm just staring at the codes at this point. 1) Here, what does i refer to? 2) What do x(n) and x(n+1) refer to? are these functions that I have to additionally define? 3) what does N refer to and why is it 10?
x is an array, x(n) is a term in the array. If x = [1 3 8 9 4], x(2) =3. Ok, let’s say that the formula is x(n) + n. We will define x = 0 to start. First loop iteration n=1 we get: x(2) = (x(1)+1) + x(1) Second loop iteration n=2 and we get: x(3) = (x(2)+2) + x(2) Third loop n = 3.... So it’s doing the calculation, and also summing all the previous terms.
Here is my very rough code. I am sure it could be optimized a whole bunch, but I want to get it moving in the right direction first. function [a, b] = AttackAffineTest(x) syms a b sola = 0; solb = 0; [~, ~, L] = getnthmost(x, 1); for i = 1 : 256 for j = 1 : 256 if(gcd(i,256)==1) a = sym('a'); b = sym('b'); [sola, solb] = solve(getnthmost(x,1)*a+b==i, getnthmost(x,2)*a+b==j); gd = gcd(sola,256); if gd == 1 a = mod(sola,256); b = mod(solb,256); formatSpec = 'Possible Key is [%1$s , %2$s]\n'; fprintf(formatSpec, a, b); end end end end &amp;#x200B; getnthmost: (Found this on stack exchange I believe, will have to go back and look again so I can give proper credit) function [val, count, L] = getnthmost(x, n) % Get unique values in x (uniquevals) and their location (ic) [uniquevals, ~, ic] = unique(x); % Accumulate the indices and sort in descending order [bincounts_sorted, idx] = sort(accumarray(ic, 1), 'descend'); % Get the nthmost value and its count val = uniquevals(idx(n)); count = bincounts_sorted(n); L = length(idx); end &amp;#x200B;
Ah I see. I got the idea. I tried the following code. Didn't seem to work though... x=-0.9; N=10; for k=1:1:N terms(k)=-((x\^k)/k); terms(k+1)=-((x\^k)/k)+ terms(k) end &amp;#x200B; Any suggestion?
I asked this same question on MATLAB Answers, and got a solid answer. Basically I was down in the weeds too much trying to do everything within one command string. I don't know if it can be done, but stepping back and looking at the math there is certainly a way that is within my Matlab skills to accomplish. Link to the answer in case anyone ends up searching with the same question: [MatLab Answers](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/444238-solve-for-two-variables-within-to-linear-modulus-equations#answer_360431) &amp;#x200B;
Do you know how to use the debugger? https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html The fundamental problem you have right now is you’re (understandably) just trying stuff and hoping something sticks. If you see exactly what your code is doing in real time you can compare it to your expected behavior and correct it. So check that that link, especially the parts about breakpoints and stepping through your code. Step through the code line by line while also doing the steps by hand on paper. They will Give different results (obviously, or you’d be done!), but going through are by step will allow you to figure out why.
I'll try that. Thank you.
Try to lower the gravitational field. (for real, though, we need a bit more to go on. How fast is the ball travelling? how "good" is your camera?, how big is the ball? what have you tried?, e.g. finding center of mass. What code have you written? Have you even spent 1 minute reading the sidebar?)
It's a golfball, which I assume is moving at 10m/s (I'm just dropping it from about 2-3 ft above the sensor. The code in matlab is pretty straightforward. The two lines I included are the only lines of code pertaining to the camera properties. 
Thanks for your answer. Now I'm having another issue, apparently Matlab and MCR don't work well in linux systems.
The issue is almost certainly with MCR. Im not familiar with it, but i know MATLAB on its own runs just fine on linux. side note: if MCR is throwing a "nativedll" error on a linux box thats a particuarly bad sign, since linux doesnt use .dll's (.so if typically the equivalent extension). .dll's are a windows-only thing.
You're right. I had the "Dll" error in windows too and other about nnmex, but installing netbeans it was fixed somehow. But in linux even installig netbeans the errors keep there. I was told I was getting that message due to my project being compiled in windows, I tried to compile it in Linux, but there was no way. And I have tried a lot of fixes I 've seen through the web, but those are really old and all I could get was a switch between Dll and nnmex error.
The most important thing in a high speed camera is illumination, if you lack ilumination or FPS, then there is your problem. Also you could try with a strobe or a flashlight pulsing light.
If the receiver is on the same release as you, then you could use Protected Model Reference. If not, you might have to do the right-click -&gt; create S-function from subsystem trick. Look these up in the documentation if you're not familiar with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jItQOPp60 or just put the subsystems in a library that you make Read Only
&gt; I was told I was getting that message due to my project being compiled in windows, Yeah...thatll do it. You cant use the same binaries on windows and linux, since each system executes code in a different way. You can (on linux, and id assume on windows to) setup what is called a "cross compiler" that alows you o generate coder that is meant to run on another system type (i.e., generate linux code from on windows or windows code from on linux). If you couldnt make compiling directly on linux work, then id look into whether your compiler on windows can cross-compile linux code.
It doesn't look like "stem" accepts symbolic arguments, so you can try evaluating "g" at a set of points: x = -6:.5:3; y = subs(g, n, x); stem(x, y); https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/stem.html#btrw_xi-6
Hey guys, having some trouble with this and would appreciate a second set of eyes. It is a super basic structural engineering script, but the problem seems to be in the code. **Program Overview** Run MainFile.m to start (as the name implies). It loads the descriptors of the beam from the Input folder, then runs it through a loading and analysis, and eventually shows deflection. **My Error** When running the program, I get the following error: Error: File: FixEndForce.m Line: 18 Column: 37 Unexpected MATLAB expression. Error in MainFile (line 37) Qf = FixEndForce(XY,LoadType,Para); **Potential Problem** I have a file called FixEndForce-Basic_Working.m included in the repo. When you use it instead of FixEndForce.m, it works as needed. However, the basic form doesn't include all loading scenarios, which is a problem. The biggest problem is that I don't see where the problem lies between the two, and having a second set of eyes would def help. Any body have any advice?
Based on what you've written, you've entered 1*sqrt(2*pi)/(std) Order of operations in Matlab is the same as any calculator. If you want to put multiple terms in the denominator, you need to either use parenthesis around everything or you need to write it like this 1/(std)/sqrt(2*pi) The other thing is that the second bit, (exp(-x+mean).2./(2(Std).2.)) should be exp(-(x-mu)^2 /(2*(std)^2)) The entirety that follows exp is supposed to be in the exponential. You need the parenthesis to make this clear
Whenever I enter that I get 0.3521 
yes, you can mask the system and lock that. by rightclick on block--&gt;mask
Seems like it's a problem with the problem statement, specifically the provided answer. My code looks like this x = 0.5 mean = 0 std = 1 P = 1/(std*sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-(x-mean)^2/(2*std^2)) And I get 0.3521 as the answer as well. I looked up the formula in question as well, and entered that form in: P = 1/(std*sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-0.5*((x-mean)/std)^2) And get the same result. 
Ok well thanks yeah they might’ve miss typed, might of typed 3 instead of 4. Thanks for the help. 
Question: How do you find the papers of a professor?
This shows 2. Order shape functions for a mid side node on a tet element. I would like to be able to plot iso-surfaces only inside the tet, but help for isosurf and meshgrid is aimed at making a rectangular grid. If I use that I get iso surfaces outside of the tet that I don't want to show. Does anyone have experience with isosurf or meshgrid and can explain why it's a matrix and not just a list of points? 
Could a light beam and a photo-resistor solve it for you, or do you need to have a picture of the ball?

I'm not aware of any build in function for something like this, so you might have to build it. An stl file is a collection of triangles, similar to patches in matlab. First determine if the nodes of the patch are all on the same side of the z-axis plane. If they are you can ignore it. Next calc where the edges cross the plane. The rest of each plane should just be projected onto the plane. I think this would be the steps, but it is not easy. Good luck

It can't convert a symbolic expression into a double array. Plotting is a numerical operation. Do you even need to be using symbols? 
`std` is a function in Matlab. You shouldn't redefine it as a variable. 
I'de use \[qmeshcut from iso2mesh\]([http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?fun/qmeshcut](http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?fun/qmeshcut)) to find the intersections of edges of the mesh with a plane. It should be clear from the doc of that function how to do that. 
figure(1) plot(...) figure(2) plot(...) figure(3) plot(...) Should do the job.
Sorry if it's a stupid question. Should I add "figure(1) " before plot3(...)? Because that's what I currently have as shown in the code I added. It's opening a separate window for each one, yes. However, each one is still getting overwritten by the newer graph. So I end up having 3 different figures, each have their own name but the plot itself only shows the last plot on all 3 figures. 
Stateflow 
Don't use indices for your figure command, i.e. instead of figure(1), figure(2), etc., just use figure
Removed the indices, same thing happens. First, the first figure comes out showing plot 1. Then the second figure pops out, and both figures show plot 2. 
There are no stupid questions... I never did plot3 things but it sounds more like you plot the samething again or you overwrite something which you don't want. Maybe try to seperate your code into pieces and try it to understand. 
The runga outta schemes are methods of solving first order differential equations. ODE45() uses an adaptive runga kutta scheme. You can probably solve your equation with ODE45 and use a small tolerance and use that solution as a comparison. When comparing I would use Root mean square or RMS() in MATLAB (think it's called that) the solution with the highest deviation from ode45 is the least accurate
There are good videos on YouTube describing runga kutta schemes and difference between them as you go towards higher order schemes. 
Ahh this is helpful and I will include it in my conclusion on how I could make it more accurate. The only issue is, I have been given the three schemes to use. I just don't know how to compare the graphs. For example does a graph with less gaps in indicate a better scheme?
Dude, I think ur plotting the same data in different windows 
If you are plotting in one figure with multiple plot calls, e.g. having multiple lines in a line plot, then you call "hold on" before the plot. Once you have plotted and formatted your plot, call "hold off" Now if you want a new figure, call "figure()" again and "hold on" .... "hold off" again. If you want to have separate handles for each figure so you can format it later call "h = figure()" where h is the handle for the figure. "h" can be any variable name of your choosing.
How do i not do that then?! It plots them in the correct order, but the overwrites the previous one
I completely get this. What I don't get is why do I get 3 separate windows (figures), where the most recent plot, overwrites the other's window. 
Another question, why you write it like p1=plot...? Use just plot(stuff) 
I've actually removed that since I posted it. Didn't change anything, so I thought better not do another edit and confuse people 
If you create a reference solution like ode15i() with tight tolerances you can assume that that solution is the real solution. Then u can simply plot the solutions in the same window and use ocular inspection in order to conclude wich scheme is more accurate. However if you want values that represents accuracy you should do root mean square between the graphs to determine how well they all fit the ode15i solution. This is a bit tricky as the solutions will have different time grids. There's probably other methods to check accuracy but this is the one I can remember from the back of my head.
Can u take a screenshot of da code? It's hard to understand the way you have posted, would be easier to help ya. 
I can't run this code. But the figure has several input parameters. If you call figure(n) where n is an interger, it will set the current figure to whatever current figure has the number property equal to n. You are not indexing figure with that value. You are assigning the current figure to an existing figure with that number property. At least that is how I understand it. This information is all in matlabs help section
I'm afraid not all of it will fit will fit in one go. But here's it, in 2 picutes [https://imgur.com/a/htYB9KT](https://imgur.com/a/htYB9KT)
The code I attached is just a snippet and not the complete code. &amp;#x200B; The rest uses a 3rd party toolbox, so I thought it would be useless to include it. &amp;#x200B; I'm not really understanding what you're saying. To be more precise, I kind of understand it, but not sure what to do to actually get it to work properly. &amp;#x200B; Here's the full code if that helps. I can post it in text form too. &amp;#x200B; [https://imgur.com/a/htYB9KT](https://imgur.com/a/htYB9KT)
Enabled subsystems work well for this. Use the I/O to drive the trigger to it.
This is probably the better answer but if you don't have access to Stateflow, I provided another option in the other comment.
Gaps? Look closely at the stability of the system. The stability of a given solution will be very sensitive to algorithm and initial conditions. Have you studied Lyapunov?
No we haven't studied that. I understand that about stability, so what am i supposed to write exactly about the graphs?
Google scholar is likely the best tool. It's a search engine that searches specifically academic articles. You can search specific authors through "author:John Doe" and you might want to add a key word about their research, e.g., fluid mechanics. This works most of the time. Otherwise, go to the professor's page on the university website or their own research page. There should be a list of their publications, then you will want to use Google Scholar to search the specific title of the paper. Getting the paper for free will be another issue if you aren't accessing through a university. The best bet here is email the Prof directly and ask for it. They will almost always send you a copy, and it gets your name in their brain for future networking/discussions.
I need a picture of the ball. Do you know of a way to change the shutterspeed or even what exposuremode = 'Timed' means?
&gt;But for i=3, we have chain(2), which equals zero, so this would refer to the 0th row? Let's look at the i = 2 loop (the first one). We calculate this_step_distribution = transition_probabilities(chain(i-1),:); Which uses chain(1), which is equal to 1. But when we get to the end of that loop, we have chain(i) = find(cumulative_distribution&gt;r,1); Which gives a value to chain(2). The next loop (i = 3), we use chain(2), which we have a value for. Note that in the code above, chain(i) will always be 1 or 2, because r is a random number between 0 and 1, and cumulative_distribution will be [x, 1] (where x is either 0.1 or 0.8 in the code above). find(cumulative_distribution &gt; r,1) gives the first index where cumulative_distribution is greater than r. Since 0&lt;r&lt;1, and cumulative_distribution is [x,1], if x&gt;r, chain(i) will be 1, but if x&lt;r, we know that 1&gt;r so chain(i) will be 2. Hope this helped.
The question (as you have asked it) is pretty poorly defined for exactly the reasons you state. How should you compare one method to another? Obviously there are ways to compare them but the point is there are many many notions of what a comparison might entail. You need to ask your instructor what they have in mind. Show them what you have done already and your plots etc. Ask them to specifically explain what it is you should be analyzing. I would recommend NOT following the other advice you have gotten which amounted to "try to figure out what your instructor had in mind". Just ask your instructor.
What does this even mean? Stability (in the numerical sense) is a property of your integration scheme, not any particular solution or system. RK45 is numerically stable whether you use it to integrate a linear equation or Lorenz or any other vector field (with sufficient regularity). The rest of your statement also seems to have nothing to do with the choice of integrator. I'm not sure what you mean by "stability of a solution". Generic solutions to generic ODEs are NEVER stable for any reasonable definition of the word.

I looked at that and it didn't really help me understand what was going on :(
check out the example for Quiver Plot. you need to create vectors representing two of your variables. for example, x and y. Then create a meshgrid as per that example. Solve your equation for your third variable, z = f(x,y) calculate values of z as per that example Then you can use surf() (See other example on that page) instead of quiver to get what I think you're looking for.
\[X,Y\] = meshgrid(1:100,1:100); Z = sqrt(100 - 25.\*X.\^2 + 4.\*Y.\^2); surf(X,Y,real(Z)) colorbar
If you just want to check a sketch, you can probably throw the equation into [WolframAlpha](http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=25x%5E2%2B4y%5E2%2Bz%5E2%3D100) and skip the Matlab stuff. 
Are you asking for help in the enabling logic, or how to activate a subsystem conditionally?
Hi, OP! Thank you for asking this question. I have no answer for you (I'm not too skillful with MATLAB), but I'd be interested to know how as well. I'm taking a Hydro class and this is what we're doing right now.
This seems like a general job application question. First, submit your resume. Get into their system. Then the real work begins. If there is a specific department you know of, find out the manager of it. Go on LinkedIn to find out the chain as well. Send that person an email or give a phone call. Just introduce yourself. Also, find out who the recruiters are. Call them as well. My friend is a recruiter for a big engineering company and she said the best people are the ones that find her.
Yeah, it where’s the fun in that
\&gt;&gt; Is there a good method to help determine the range of permeabilities for a specific porosity given my porosity and permeability data set? &amp;#x200B; This isn't so much a MATLAB question as much as it is a Linear Regression one. What you are trying to do here is to define a linear relationship (permeability = m\*porosity + b) between the two variables. If you have a bunch of data you can use MATLAB's backslash operator to find those coefficients. Check out the Least Squares section here: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mldivide.html) &amp;#x200B; The m and b found in this way are just the parameters that find the "best fit" for the linear regression, but from there you'd want to look at Prediction Intervals so that given a specific porosity, you can get the range. This approach makes some statistical assumptions. Alternatively if you have a very large amount of data such that you have lots of permeability data points for each value of porosity, and lots of porosity data points for each value of permeability, you can calculate an observed range for your input. The benefit of the Prediction Interval is that it would spit out a range for ANY input value based on the probabilistic model. &amp;#x200B; As for the Monte Carlo sampling...I'm not too sure why you would do that. Doing a Linear Regression/Prediction Interval will show the relationship between all your data points. Typically you do a MC simulation to estimate parameters, or generate observed distributions. In this case, however, you have all your data; you don't need to do any MC type operations since you have everything already.
Thank you very much for the information regarding linear regression. The reason I’m wanting to do Monte Carlo sampling is because I want to use generated random data within a geocellular grid for flow simulation purposes. I suppose this is generating an observed distribution?

This package only allows you to convert 3D or 2D volumetric images into a 3D mesh, is there a way to go the other way? 
Yes! The lecturer is pretty useless to be honest. The question asks me to plot the Lorenz attractor in the X-Z plane for each scheme and find the solutions for each. I have to "Compare the performance of the numerical methods at maintaining this section of the attractor"
Would a callback that fires on updating handle it?
Yes precisely like that
it does a ton of different stuff with different functions. The function i linked (qmeshcut) can slice at STL file in the Z direction and extract 2D images of the cross-section 
I used to work there and do some recruiting for the department I was in. About 2/3 of succesful hires do not have a referral. Also, if you interested in the company in general, not just that specific position, apply to their Engineering Development Group. It's easier to get hired there and it is designed specifically for people fresh out of grad school, so it's a great environment for learning, transitioning to a fulltime job, and socializing. You'll learn so much more MATLAB that you didn't even know existed. And in a few months you'll be able to transfer to something like that open research scientist position, but with a leg up on the competition and the opportunity to try it out with a project first before committing to it permanently.
I've been having a look at this today but still struggling, got any advice on this subject?
A bit of both, I've only used If blocks and subsystems to change states.
Want to share a model? PM me if you want. I'd need to know what you are struggling with.
Thanks, I'll drop you a PM.
Not sure what u want but maybe something like this Q(:,k) = [value1 value2] ?
I guess I want to run a function on each row and column and create a matrix out of it.
Can you summarize your issue in a short example problem?
A=[1,2,3,4] B=[4, 5, 6] C=Function(A,B) (for this we'll just say the function is addition A+B) C= [5,6,7,8 ; 6,7,8,9 ; 7,8,9,10] In this example it just takes the two vectors and processes all the values in A and B against each other. My function is the Francis Formula, but I want it to do the same thing.
So I would probably do C= zeros(length(B), length(A)) for k = 1:length(B) C(:,k) = A+B(k) end
Found a solution, its not what I was looking for because it doesnt do it as a matrix operation, but it will work clear all, clc function [WeirHeadloss] = FF (CutpointCFS, WeirLength) %Goal Seek for result=Headloss WeirHeadloss = 0 ; Q = 0; %set inital value for Weir Loss(inches) while CutpointCFS-Q&gt;.001 WeirHeadloss=WeirHeadloss+.00001; %Headloss is in Feet Q=3.33*(WeirLength/12-.2*WeirHeadloss)*WeirHeadloss^1.5; %Derived from Francis Formula Q=3.33(L-.2*H)*H^1.5 end %WeirHeadloss=WeirHeadloss * 12 %convert WeirLoss to inches From feet end WeirLength = [192, 193, 194, 195, 196]; %weir Length vector CutpointCFS=[36, 37, 38]; %cubic Feet Per Second Vector [WeirHeadloss]=zeros(length(CutpointCFS),length(WeirLength)); for c = 1:1:length(CutpointCFS) %step through CFS Vector for w = 1:1:length(WeirLength) %step through Weir Length Vector WeirHeadloss(c,w)=FF(CutpointCFS(c),WeirLength(w)) %WeirHeadloss(c,w)=CutpointCFS(c)*WeirLength(w) end end WeirHeadloss=WeirHeadloss * 12 %convert WeirLoss to inches From feet %Headloss=FF(WL,CP) %WeirLength=192, CutpointCFS=36 WeirHeadloss=9.3001 
I have found a workaround, I will post it here hoping it will help anyone. If somebody has better ideas I am waiting for suggestions: &amp;#x200B; function HelpButtonPushed(app, event) \[file,path\] = uiputfile('help.pdf'); resultFilePath = fullfile(path,file); urlwrite('[http://192.168.1.1:82/help.pdf](http://192.168.1.1:82/Aplicatia1.pdf)',resultFilePath); end &amp;#x200B; I should mention I am hosting the help pdf on a local http server.
how are you wanting to categorise the data? I thought your if statements were a pretty decent way of doing what I thought u wanted to do?
Something like this? clc;clear all; x = input('x: '); brkpt = [0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100]; nameList = ['A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'F' 'G' 'H' 'I' 'J']; for ii = 1:length(brkpt) - 1 if (x&gt;= brkpt(ii) &amp; x&lt;brkpt(ii+1)) sprintf('%s',nameList(ii)) end end 
If you're going to be doing some sort of flow simulation, then Monte Carlo is probably appropriate (or at least can be). &amp;#x200B; The way i'd probably go about doing it, without too much of an understanding of exactly what you're trying to do, is to first find the linear regression line, then as your "thing" is going through the different permeability points, use the Prediction Interval to get a sample Porosity value. 
Is this a homework assignment? If not, it sounds like the kind of thing I'd get paid to write. 
I'm not sure it's trivial, but it's definitely already been solved (or some variant of it). Check out the Munkres (also called Hungarian) algorithm
For over and under determined systems, you need to use the [pseudoinverse](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pinv.html). For overdetermined systems, this is effectively using a linear least squares method to solve the best approximation. For underdetermined solutions, there are infinite number of equally good solutions. The pseudoinverse method will find the solution with the smallest norm. 
I should maybe add that i'm not allowed to use: inv, rref, \ and commands like them. Since they want the student to come up with their own "routines". I unfortunatley think pseudoinverse would not be allowed :/.
But the link I sent you still teaches you what the psuedoinverse is and how to calculate it. You can write your own function using it. 
 But if you were to add pseudoinverse to the code would it still be cosidered as using Gaussian Elimination? I appreciate your help!
A step in making the pseudoinverse is making a square matrix. You can then do Gaussian elimination on that square matrix. 
I believe you are looking for "delay on" logic, which extends the ideas behind debounce logic. Look up "debounce". &amp;#x200B; Stateflow is the ideal candidate for this (it can be done with two states and and "after" statement in a transition). HOWEVER, if you're more of a pure Simulink lover, you can get started with a summing block, a unit delay, a compare-to-constant, and a switch (with two constants feeding in). Basically, create an integrator with the summing block and unit delay. Once the integral reaches the desired value (using compare-to-constant block), feed it into a switch as the enable signal. Until the compare block output turns TRUE, switch selects 0. &amp;#x200B; It's been a while since I've had to build debounce logic. Memories...
Why does this code seem to work for non-square matrices? https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/130593-hi-am-working-on-a-code-for-gaussian-elimination If you consider the code marked as a "accepted answer". It does not seem that he uses pseudoinverse or least square method? Does this still solve the linear system (Ax=b) but makes a bad approximation of the solution?
Look up the “Moore-Penrose Inverse”. This will lead you to some formulae that are equivalent to the matlab “pinv” function. You should be able to quickly code and cite the Moore-Penrose method. 
Ideas: 1. Try to define a cost function or objective function, i.e. a function that will return a numerical value that will be a performance score. It could be a linear combination of the performance of the workers with boolean values/binary switches that will take the value 1 if the worker has that task assigned or 0 if not. 2. You could brute force every valid combinations of 0 and 1 that will satisfy your function, and then repeatedly evaluate the cost function on those vectors and choose the vector that maximizes it (this can become rapidly hard because the number of combinations grows rapidly with the number of workers and tasks). 3. This looks to me like a operations research problem. You could try to build a linear system with equations representing the problem and a linear cost function, and simply apply a simplex algorithm to it. Like if a worker
I think his intentions are to try to program this from scratch with very little influence apart for the course literature. I wonder though. Why does this code seem to work? https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/130593-hi-am-working-on-a-code-for-gaussian-elimination See the code marked as "answer". The code does not seem to use any of the mentioned methods?
You can still do gaussian elimination on a non-square matrix. I don't know if the code is different than the code for a square matrix, but it is a legal algorithm to apply. Sure, you cant get to identity matrix, but you can still find the rank of the matrix using this process.
Thanks, I’ll definitely check that out! 
Not homework lol. It’s been a while since I’ve used this software and I didn’t want it to be on my resume if I didn’t know how to use it so I’ve just been trying things that I think would be cool to re teach myself haha
hey, its you again :). you want to fill a polygon, but you actually have 3 polygoni (polygons probably, but i like polygoni). The nans make it subsequent points in a list are not connected with a line when you plot them. That explains the differnece between the first two images. What you need to do is call fill three times, one for each nan-delineated section of coordinates. ' find(isnan(x)) ' is probably going to be usefull.
Awesome, ill give this a go. Thanks so much for the help :) 
My first thought is that this can be posed as a constrained optimization problem using one of the solvers for matrix defined minimization. 
OK, thanks a lot for the advice
Thank you a lot, it is always great to have insight from the inside ;)
Ended up doing something similar to this 
Just wanted to 2nd this. The other answers mentioning the pseudoinverse are absurd. You wouldn't solve Ax = b by inverted A in the nonsingular square case. Why on earth would you compute a pseudo-inverse in this case? Gaussian elimination works exactly the same. You literally change nothing in your code. When it comes time to backsolve for a solution, all you have to add is something which checks for nonexistent solutions or infinitely many solutions, and then does something appropriate in each case. 
It looks like that block is only for use with Simulink Real-Time. Are you using SLRT?
* You need some kind of image recognition algorithm that can find the pixels that represent the dots. Then you need a camera model that can translate these pixels into angles. Then you need a tracker that can keep track of which dots that are the same over different frames (if the pattern of the dots is non-symetrical and known, you can match the detected dots to a model of the object instead). * A fish eye camera will change the camera model so that a certain pixel represents a different angle than in a “normal” camera. * You don’t need to know the distance. But it could be helpful since it would remove a variable from the tracking or matching step, especially if the object will move in the depth axis.
Just double click on your values in the workspace and the table display will show
Thank you!
I've started to look at the blocks you've mentioned and I believe they'll be a great fit to the model. Thank you. I am generating code out to an Arduino Mega. My main model has input from a KTM ride by wire throttle, selectable throttle maps, LCD output (user info and error reporting) and output to a servo. This addition was to enable a user selectable warm up profile of a series of blips.
