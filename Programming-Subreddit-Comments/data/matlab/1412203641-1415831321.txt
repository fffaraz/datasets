Just an FYI, I'm not sure why you want to do this with loops. Matlab works much better when you vectorize. For example, this produces the same result as your initial code: function grayscale1(a) filename = input('Enter a filename: ', 's'); a = imread(filename); image(mean(a,3)); Note also that image() will show you the image using the default color map, where red corresponds to the minimum value of 'a' and blue corresponds to the maximum. Instead, you'll want to use imshow(), which interprets your values as RGB if size(a,3)==3, and as grayscale if a is 2D.
Haha whoops, sorry. 
The equations for vec(i) and x are incorrect. When writing MATLAB code it is important to think about the equation you are trying to implement before writing the code to implement it. Start by deriving the equations that you wish to implement. 1) Write an algebraic equation for vec\_i in terms of vec\_(i-1) and i 2) Write an algebraic equation for x in terms of vec\_i and i After you have derived these equations it should be fairly straight forward to implement them using MATLAB's basic mathematical operators. 
THANK YOU!!!! Just in case anyone cares what ended up working was fprintf('%4.2f &lt; tau &lt; %4.2f \n', FT_stress([1 3 5]), FT_stress([2 4 6));
Yes, what s/he said. You can avoid your original workaround this way by not having to replace your strings with integers. Also check out readtable() if you're running R2013b or later. It's awesome.
What have you tried so far? There is nothing wrong with asking for homework help but you should show what you have tried and your thought process Anyway, so as to not be totally useless, notice that the question asks for a surface plot. Check out the function `surf` and see some of those examples. 
Alright thanks, ill give it a go
http://i.imgur.com/3zFC7aS.jpg This is what I have so far, I'm not sure why I got that error as I'm pretty sure all input variables are accounted for

Note that they are pretty much worse than m-file functions in every aspect but ease of use. They are computationally slower, for one. 
Well, if you just want to plot a circle... t=0:.01:2*pi; x=cos(t); y=sin(t); plot(x,y); axis square; No (user-defined) functions needed!
For a gui, look into the figure's CloseRequestFcn callback. For a function in general (eg. To run code if the user stops the function with Ctrl-C) look into the onCleanup() function. For GUIs, it is quite easy. Quick tip when debugging - 'close all force' will let you close the GUI if you broke the CloseRequestFcn and can't close the window normally. 
0:2*pi will only give you 7 points. Put an increment in there. But my guess is that you're not inputting r as the function call says you will. When it comes to line 12, it needs that variable but you didn't give it. 
How would I do an increment? Also r is the value I am trying to generate so doesn't that need to go after I have introduced all the variables? I've looked at a friends one and we are practically identical but I can't seem to see why mine doesn't work
I have the feeling you are not calling the function correctly, can you show us how you run it?
I just type in the name of the function
Okay, so you have written a function that expects an input argument r and you are calling it without supplying that argument. Do you see how that might be a problem? You have to actually give it the values for r
For what she is asking to simply define f as a function of x an anon function would be easiest.
There are two ways to generate an array with the increment. The way I tend to see most often: 0:2*pi/99:2*pi; % Gives 100 spaces Or the way I prefer (and I don't know why it isn't used more) linspace(0,2*pi,100); % Also gives 100 without any fencepost issues Anyway, it looks like someone else already answered about the input argument. But I will add that if you want to include `r` in line 12, you need to define it first in the `meshgrid` Two more tips: * put a semicolon (`;`) at the end of each line so you do not fill your screen with output * If you want to share code in reddit, better than a photo is to past with with four (4) preceding spaces. This way, someone can also copy it and run it on their end for testing. Anyway, best of luck. Glad to see you're giving it a real try.
Thanks for the tips, With the increment you have used pi, however pi is only needed to find the value of T wouldn't it? I don't think it would effect r, I could be wrong though
I was kinda shocked to hear this so I tried it out: g=@(x) x^2+3*x+9; tic for i=1:1e7 y=f(i); end toc tic for i=1:1e7 y=g(i); end toc and the function: function y=f(x) y=x^2+3*x+9; end result: Elapsed time is 2.592264 seconds. Elapsed time is 5.346830 seconds. So you weren't kidding. In this case it was **twice** as slow as the m-file function! Which is kind of annoying to hear because I use anonymous functions a lot... Do you happen to know why this is the case?
The pi one was an example. You also have `1:rd` which will return: (you set `rd = 15`) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 which may be fine, but what if you wanted 20 points? Then you should do linspace(1,rd,20); Then it isn't dependant on `rd`. You'll always get 20 evenly spaces points
The question just asks to generate values for r, should I assume a number or just use the 15?
You can have your main script be a function of zero parameters. You can then define additional help functions after the main "function" has ended. 
I do not know exactly what you're asking, but I think you were on the right track with your `meshgrid`. I would do something like [T r] = meshgrid(linspace(0,2*pi,30),linspace(0,rd,30)); which will result in a 30x30 grid. But either way, I am not 100% sure of what you or the question is asking. I was making a suggestion about using meshgrid
It depends on what you define as a "repeated" view. How far away from a specific viewpoint do you need to get before the next view in considered unique? 1 degree? 3 degrees? 10 degrees? Perhaps something like: for i1 = 0:17 % 10 degrees at a time Rotate around z-axis by 10 degrees for i2 = 0:35 Rotate around x-axis by 10 degrees end end 
I would imagine that rotating the X axis 4 times, the Y axis twice, and the Z axis once would give you a view of everything. It probably doesn't minimize total motion of course. I don't know what you mean by "all views," since there are an uncountably infinite number of possible views, and thus no way to cover them all with a finite number of possible defined motions (translation/rotation). If you want to see every point on the object, then this depends entirely on whether or not the object is convex. But you could look down on it at a 45^o angle, rotate it around, then shift to looking up at it at a 45^o angle and rotate again.
The function `max` has built in functionality to find the argmax index. [max_val, max_ind] = max(sensors, [], 2) Now to answer your title. Say you were looking for the occurrences of specific values (not necessarily max) per sensor. You could have a 5x1 vector of search values, `v`. A binary map of row-wise corresponding occurrences of `v` in `sensors` can be obtained using occ = bsxfun(@eq, sensors, v) You can then find the index of the first occurrence by exploiting the argmax functionality of the `max` function [~, occ_ind] = max(occ, [], 2)
How about just moving it a bit like a rubik's cube? I mean something like: Down 90 degrees, Right 90 degrees, Down 90 degrees, Right 90 degrees, Down 90 degrees.

what do you mean not passing a value? sorry :p new to coding
 stnd_dev = sqrt((1/N)*summation(f(x) - avg_f,1,a,b)); What is *x* in this line? Where is it defined
It is defined in the summation function, but I also edited my code so it shows up in the the stat_calc function: function [avg_f,stnd_dev] = stat_calc(f,a,b,N) x = linspace(a,b,N); avg_f = (1/N)*summation(f,N,a,b); stnd_dev = sqrt((1/N)*summation(f(x) - avg_f,1,a,b)); end ----- and its telling me: "Undefined function 'minus' for input arguments of type 'function_handle'. Error in stat_calc (line_4) stnd_dev = sqrt((1/N)*summation(**f(x) - avg_f**,1,a,b));
It is generally not enough to define it in one function - the other functions will not know of it unless you define it as a global variable. Also, you want to input a function handle and not a vector into summation( , , , ). this is done by inputting **f** which is a function handle and not **f(x)** which is a vector. General rule here: If you have a function that takes a function handle as an argument, say summation(f), you have to input a handle and not a vector when you use that function. A handle is generated by * Defining a function inline as you did with *f = @(x) ....;* * Using predefined functions. Here, you have to point to the handle when calling your function by using the @ symbol, e.g. summation(@sin) for the sinus. A simple summation(sin) will not work here. Where does this fit into your problem? Your argument *f(x)-avg_f* are **not** both functionhandles. This can be avoided by defining a new function f_combined = @(x) f(x) - avg_f; stnd_def = sqrt..... *summation(f_combined, 1, a, b); The definition of x within *stat_calc* becomes unnecessary. With my original comment, I wanted to lead you to replacing *f(x)* with *f* (one is a vector, the other a function handle) and not to defining *x* in this context ;)
It's amazing to me that it took until 2014b to have plots that zoom with time natively. tlabel.m from the file exchange is a must have for anyone with 2014a and below.
Just another 3 years before we get it at work!
Time to start rewriting code. The GUI stuff looks pretty useful. 
We're still on 2010b because testing our existing codebase on any version after that is just an impossible task.
I AM http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/groot.html
I about pooped myself when I saw in the prerelease that dot notation could be used for modifying object properties. `set` and `get` are so annoying to type out every time.
I would like to know this as well. Also is there a student price for MatLab? Id like to have it on my personal computer.
Git integration with the Current Folder window. About fucking time...
According to mathworks, Yosemite is listed as supported. http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/current_release/index.html?sec=mac
Is your licence not valid for all versions? Or is it a question of existing code potential problems. 
f(end)
I had an interesting discussion with someone who worked both in academics and in industry. It seems that while for personal use people immediately upgrade to the latest greatest, academics tend to follow slightly behind because of project schedules and reluctance to switch in the middle, and in industry companies require thorough testing of every new version prior to adoption. 
You can also access elements near the end of the vector by using f(end-1), f(end-2), etc Good luck :)
That general trend would fit my expectations. As an academic I am not reluctant to upgrade but I would only do it when I am installing a new OS version (or changing desktop), I hear from industry friends that they often hold back on upgrades because of the whole "if it works why change it" philosophy (not that that is a bad philosophy).
Why do you need this type of input? What is the goal of what you're trying to accomplish?
By far the simplest solution would be to ask yourself if it really matters whether it emulates getch() perfectly, since it doesnt seem like needing to press enter would be a big deal from your C code snippet. If you definitely need it, this script looks promising, though no idea if it still works in the latest version. http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7465-getkey
This is kinda what i was looking for. Actually in don't need it. I found getch() a very snappy solution with just a little extra code. I was just wondering if it was worth the code. Now i see that i can't do it by myself but this function you linked is suitable. thank you!
Does anyone know how the omnipresent export_fig will fare if matlab natively applies AA to the plots?
Tried f(end) that reproduces 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 x where x is the value.
For == to work the two arrays on both sides have to be of equal size or one has to be a single value. So this is allowed: [1 2 3]==[3 4 5] which returns [0 0 0] and [1 2 3]==3 which returns [0 0 1]. In your case the problem is probably that intersect(...,...) returns an array of values which contains more than 1 and not an equal number as currentRedFlashindeces. You can use ismember which just checks which elements of the first array are also a member of the second array and returns the indices. So ismember([1 2 3], [3 4 5]) returns [0 0 1]. In your case you could replace that line with: currentRedFlashIndeces(ismember(currentRedFlashIndeces,intersect(...,...)))=[]; Of course you need to know what that line is supposed to do to know if the above is the desired result. I'd just ask the professor who wrote this, seems to me that he should know the best. Also check what currentRedFlashIndeces and the output of intersect(...,...) are after you get the error.
First of all, add 4 spaces in front of each line so it is readable on reddit. Secondly, use semicolons after every line to suppress matlab from printing everything in the command window. Thirdly, you have the function with an input r but you don't actually do anything with it, because you redefine r inside the function. So in this part: K = E *(t^3) /(12*(1-nu^2)); w = ((P*rd^4) /(64*K)) *(1-(r/rd )^2 )^2+c; %using the meshgrid in built function to generate the values of T and r [T r] = meshgrid(linspace(0,2*pi,30),linspace(0,rd,30)); %transforms the polar coordinates to cartesian [X,Y]=pol2cart(T,r); %Define variables K and w and create a surface plot K = E *(t^3) /(12*(1-nu^2)); w = ((P*rd^4) /(64*K)) *(1-(r/rd ).^2 ).^2+c; you calculate first K and w with the given input r, but then you redefine r and calculate K and w again which makes no sense. The actual bug is though that in your code you use \^2 instead of .\^2 (like i have above) to do element wise power calculation. This is needed because r is a square matrix and A\^2 is also a valid matrix calculation (A\*A) for square matrices, but this is not what you want in this case. So for element wise operations always use ./ .\^ .\*. 
Industry here... We've had 2014b for several months...
Yes! Yes! Yes! That time has finally come! 
That link appears to require a log in. From the sounds of it, you don't seem to have given this any thought. Revise your lectures/notes, read carefully through your assignment and then ask specific questions about what you don't understand. People are usually more than happy to help, but they won't do your assignment for you.
Both 2014a and 2014b work for me on 10.9 at least. I haven't tried 10.10 yet. They seem to have updated the version of Java they're using too so it plays nice with retina displays.
I'm guessing that what you call the index of the characters is actually the ascii value of the characters, since you are initializing astr as =0, a number. Start by deleting that unnecessary line, and you will have an easier time debugging your code.
Got a hunch it's because you're trying to do a logic test on a string (which you can't). Try strcmp(str(i ), lchar)==1
have you tried a while loop instead of a for loop where you are modifying i? also, prefer ii to i because i could mean literal complex number like 3+4i.
By index I mean the position of a certain letter in the string. I put astr=0 because I didn't want an error message about a variable not being set. I'll try to remove it. Thanks. 
I know what you mean by index, but what you're seeing is not that.
When you say you can handle .mats with your C# application, does that mean you can load .mats? Why don't you save your variables as .mats? save(variablename,variables) will save it in to a struct of your variables. Or save it to an ascii file with save. 
Well I am trying to avoid the user having to save variables to disk, then drag from explorer the saved mat file into my application. I am attempting to find a direct drag-from-matlab solution.
You are right- what I'm not quite understand yet is why I can't actually "drop" the object (I get an error icon that won't let me drop). However, the "DragOver" event is being called as soon as I enter the window, and I do see it's passing some information from matlab. private void this_ListView_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { var a = (System.Windows.Forms.DataObject)e.Data; var q1 = a.GetData(typeof(String)); } q1 is giving me the matlab variable name. I am still figuring out how to get the underlying data, but it's a start. Thanks for your comment, made me try again from my app. If anyone is interested I'll try to post a full follow up once I see how the underlying data is being passed over. edit: Actually I'm not convinced Matlab is sending the data over, it only seems to be sending the variable names. I have tried to call all of the getdata() types and nothing. Plus, I just created a massive matrix and dragged it over, and it obviously did not copy the data or it would have taken longer.. Seems to me Matlab is not passing the data, only the variable name. Same with copy/paste. If you right click-&gt;copy on a variable, and paste it into notepad or something it pastes the variable names only. Bleh.
Removing astr=0 gives me these resulting 13k characters as a string instead of a vector (as previously), but all those zeros are now blank spaces with the required text at the end of that long string. While debugging I noticed that all those blank spaces come from the first iteration of the while loop. For some reason, matlab stores all previous characters in astr even though I tell it to start looping from midind-41 and to start saving from lchar. Any idea why?
The R1 and C1 values you are specifying in csvread are row and column offsets, i.e. an offset value of R1=0, C1=0 will read the top left row and column in your data. I think this is the problem. Should be able to fix it by something like: M=csvread('001_ac.csv',20,1,[20 1 2269 3]) If that doesn't work, only read in 1 row and 1 column (i.e. 1 pt of data) with csvread and make sure that that you get out of csvread is what you'd expect it to be from your data. Once you have it figured out, go from there. 
Ahh, ok thanks that solved the problem!
Hey, thanks for the info. Really appreciate it
Given the CDF, the easiest method is [Inverse Transform Sampling](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling).
i still miss some basic features like... bracket highlight or color code (no, underline is bullhsit)
Each checkbox has a callback function which is triggered when it is checked or unchecked. Each time a box is checked, the function needs to look at all of the other checkboxes to see if they're checked. Something along the lines of: get(handles.checkbox1, 'Value')) If there are already 3 checkboxes checked, then throw up the warning or error. Also you can programmatically check/uncheck the boxes, which you'll need to do if the current one is #4.
It's simple but have you tried ```//user@password:url/database.asmx``` 
Just to add to this, if the numbers in `sensors` are doubles (as opposed to integers), you may need to be careful. Instead of occ = bsxfun(@eq, sensors, v) You may want to try occ_diff = bsxfun(@minus, sensors, v); occ = abs(occ_diff) &lt;= 1e2*eps(max(abs(occ_diff))); where I use `1e2*eps(max(abs(occ_diff)))` as a tolerance for machine precision.
It is really slow because you are resizing the Time and Result arrays every loop. Preallocate them using nan(). Since the size of the arrays is random just make them large enough. Then use Result(ii,:)=state; to save each state, same for Time. ii is an index which is updated each loop. Hint: type 'profile viewer' in the command window and then run your code. You can see exactly how much time each command takes. 
Thanks a bunch! By preallocating i shaved the time down to five seconds!

This is the assignment.. Project 1: Prime Numbers Objectives: Research/review the concept of Prime Numbers Execute a small MATLAB program. Document your results Prime Numbers: Use internet resources to review the definition of prime numbers. Write a mathematical formula for calculating a prime. Do not use the class PowerPoint charts as a source --- use external (web-based) information, citing your source(s). Getting Started With MATLAB: At the MATLAB menu, enter File  New script, to type the commands below. Enter File  Save As to save this program. Give it a name like “checkprime” as illustrated below. Make sure to file it in a directory in which you can find it later!
I am not not sure exactly what this means. It is only worth 15pts so I think making any code that runs relating to prime numbers should give me points. He is a pretty laid back teacher.
What do you have written so far? Where are you getting stuck? It sounds like you already know what left and right hand approximation is, so where are you having troubles applying it?
You could do it numerically. If you have a scalar function f(x1,x2,...,xn), you can minimize it using the fminsearch function. You have to minimize the negative of the function. That would give you the approximate maximum value of the function, and you could divide your symbolic function through by it.
Yeah, they didn't write that well. I assume they don't want you using the built-in prime number capabilities of Matlab. I'd execute the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes); it's fairly simple; make it run from 2:N_max; for proof of concept you can just use N_max = 100 but your teacher should be able to see that it could go forever. Of course, technically this isn't a "mathematical formula for generating a prime", but rather an algorithm; hopefully that's what they want. You might check with the instructor before you execute it to make sure it'll meet their expectations, but given what they wrote I'm not surprised you're confused, that's a poorly conceived assignment. 
did they update the boxplot? if they did, I myself can might jump ship from 2012b on my rigs at the office. 
Thank you very much it helps me a lot =)
 Thank you very much it helps me a lot =)
Hey bud, sounds like homework. We want everyone to succeed here, so I'll get you started, but you gotta know that right in the sidebar it says we don't do homework. First thing, don't make our eyes bleed; write out your code with a line before it, and then four spaces before each line so it looks like code: data=load('displacement.dat'); for x= data(:,1) for y= data(:,2) dydx = Next, give us an idea of your theoretical understanding, and what exactly the difficulty is. In your case, write some kind of equation that attempts to solve it, post your results, and tell us how they're wrong. Asking vague stuff tends to call down the Hammer of Cleve on unsuspecting engineers.
First of all, are your variables strings? Don't use ~= for strings. Use strcmp or strcmpi. Also you need to expand your logic statement. That won't work the way you have it.
You could associate your inputs with numerical values and then your logical tests would work. input 1 for circle, 2 for square...
Do you want an actual, bona fide error message? Or do you just want it to display a message warning the users? I would use switch &amp; case and use otherwise. valid=0 while ~valid response=prompt user switch response 
Is the norm() command not working?
Comments so far have some good points but I think they are missing one of the critical problems with the code OP posted. You can't treat "and" and "or" in programming like you can in English. In English you can say "Is the fruit an apple or an orange or a pear?" and that makes sense. But not in programming. Instead, if I have a variable named `fruit` and I want to see if it is equal to 1 or 2 or 3, I have to say something like: if fruit == 1 || fruit == 2 || fruit == 3 % more code would go here end The logical 'or' operator only works on full statements, you see. Also note that I used double bars rather than a single bar. There *is* a single-bar | operator, but you typically wouldn't use it in this context. You use it to do a kind of binary arithmetic operation (also called an 'or' operation) on two variables. There are definitely times when you would want to do such a thing, but based on the content of your question it looks like you're pretty firmly in the beginner stages and you wouldn't need to do that for a while -- so I won't go on any more about it for now.
If you're using the statement you wrote (I.e.: "while shape~=r|h|c"), that could be part of your problem. Matlab would evaluate that as "shape ~= (r|h|c)", not as "~((shape==r) | (shape==h) | (shape==c))", which is probably what you want. That is to say: as you wrote it, Matlab is evaluating "logical(r) | logical(h) | logical(c)", then comparing that result to "shape". If r, h and c are not all the same size as each other, the element-wise or (the " | " operator) will fail due to non-identical size vectors; if they're not all the same size as "shape", the not-equal comparison (which is also an element-wise operator) will fail for the same reason. And if they're all the same size but not scalar (eg, identical-length strings), the "while" will fail because the condition does not evaluate to a scalar logical. All of which is a long way to say: if you're going to use strings, use strcmp (or strcmpi, or some other function meant to do strong comparisons). And, regardless, to get the entire comparison in a single line, construct an array (or, for strings, a cellstr) of accepted values, compare the test value to the array and use "any" to see if it matched. For example: if the accepted values for "shape" are "rectangle", "hyperbola" and "circle", compare by: any(strcmp (shape, {'rectangle', 'hyperbola', 'circle'})); Numbers use the same style: any(shape==[1,2,3]); As long as"shape" is a scalar. 
Sorry for the poor formatting. This is my first attempt at a post (I checked already to see if someone asked this question), but I don't seem to be able to get the hard return after "Some of the things I've tried so far are, but not limited to," to go through, and I guess as a result the 4 spaces won't apply to the code I list... Also, CAPTCHA ruins me about 80% of the time despite my best efforts and thinking I have it correct 100% of the time...
A friend of mine who is better at searching the web than I found this perfectly helpful PDF: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utdallas.edu%2F~dlm%2F3350%2520comm%2520sys%2FFFTandMatLab-wanjun%2520huang.pdf&amp;ei=y58zVPPSEOGV8QGqlYDoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGO-FgNEf52oWlTt-SfzaVA2pa6lg&amp;sig2=6u9rYCU853xv8YjCylwwcA&amp;bvm=bv.76943099,d.b2U&amp;cad=rja For any who may be interested.
That's a PDE, not an ODE (dsolve solves these). You can solve some algebraically (including yours), matlab does not have a builtin function to do that though. However, you can solve them numerically if you have the PDE toolbox, see: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/partial-differential-equations.html
it's called a while loop
While loop with some threshold for accuracy criteria. Say you want your solution to be accurate within 1/1000, or once your calculations exceed some value you know you've gotten "there". threshval = 0.001; thresupdate = 100; while thresupdate &gt; threshval % do fun stuss % update thresupdate end
If you're using strings, you can also use ismember: while ~ismember(fruit, {'apple', 'pear', 'orange'})
Check out the [doc page for anonymous functions](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html) The syntax needs to be: func = @(arg1, arg2...) f(arg1, arg2...); Your construction of `func` is missing the argument(s). What are you trying to solve for in `fzero` ? 
Here you go: matches=length(intersect(a,b));
intersect! That is awesome, thank you.
I hope this continues being worked on; that said, i have little use for a data frame in matlab unless the apply functions are also implemented 
Thanks for that, I completely forgot about the arguments. I'm trying to solve for "y" in the equation. The n4 and n5 variables are the ones with the "y" that I need (noted towards the beginning). I have to have 17 values but was only able to get one "y". Just to follow up: I was also getting an error with "&amp;&amp;". Operands to the and &amp;&amp; operators must be convertible to logical scalar values error. So I changed the "for" to "if" and I'm going to add another set of similar arguments for 1700&gt;=Tp&gt;=6000 to use different equations. if (Tp &gt;= 400) &amp;&amp; (Tp &lt;= 1600) hco = a1+(b1.*Tp)+(c1.*log(Tp)); hco2 = a2+(b2.*Tp)+(c2.*log(Tp)); hh2o = a3+(b3.*Tp)+(c3.*log(Tp)); hn2 = a4+(b4.*Tp)+(c4.*log(Tp)); ho2 = a5+(b5.*Tp)+(c5.*log(Tp)); else hco = aa1+(bb1.*Tp)+(cc1.*log(Tp)); hco2 = aa2+(bb2.*Tp)+(cc2.*log(Tp)); hh2o = aa3+(bb3.*Tp)+(cc3.*log(Tp)); hn2 = aa4+(bb4.*Tp)+(cc4.*log(Tp)); ho2 = aa5+(bb5.*Tp)+(cc5.*log(Tp)); func = @(y) n_2.*(hco2-h_CO2)+n_3.*(hh2o-h_H2O)+(y-15.5).*(ho2-h_O2)+(3.76*y).*(hn2-h_N2)-6312300; y = fzero(func,1); Do you think this would work? I need to graph the 17 "y" values for each Tp value. Haven't gotten to the graph part yet. I'm sure its just "plot(y,Tp)".
You have to construct the variables `hco`,...,`ho2` differently. So I guess these chemicals are nonlinear functions of Tp. Here's how I would approach it: temp = nan(size(Tp)); % Mass preallocation hco=temp; hco2=temp; hh2o=temp; hn2=temp; ho2=temp; inds = (Tp &gt;= 400) &amp; (Tp &lt;= 1600); hco(inds) = a1+(b1.*Tp(inds))+(c1.*log(Tp(inds))); hco(~inds) = aa1+(bb1.*Tp(~inds))+(cc1.*log(Tp(~inds))); ...(and so forth for the other formulas) I can't guarantee that this falls in line with your logic of trying to use `fzero` though.
Might want to throw in some checks in case you never hit a steady state. You might be waiting forever and just computing a bunch of Infs.
Well I'm assuming ace_data(:,1) is the list of years? b gives you the index of the max value (where the max in ace_data(:,2)) occurs, so you can just use the same index on column 1 to get the year. ace_data(b,1)
that makes sense, thank you.
Not sure if I completely understand, but does the "find" command help you at all? 
i looked into it on the matlab site but i couldn't get it to work and mudernworfhair have me another solution that worked.
Where are you stuck at?
lets just say, this is what i have so far... v=input('Please input your vector: \n')
&gt;If you're using the statement you wrote (I.e.: "while shape~=r|h|c"), that could be part of your problem. Matlab would evaluate that as "shape ~= (r|h|c)", Actually comparison operators have a higher precedence than boolean operators. shape ~= r | c | h would evaluate as: (((shape ~=r )|c)|h) likewise r | c | h ~= shape would evaluate as: ((r|c)|(h~=shape)) See: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/operator-precedence.html
Unfortunately, this subreddit isn't for just asking people to do your homework for you. However, I can help a little. Why don't you start by creating a for loop that would evaluate any generic vector based on your requirements and post it. Do you know how to use for loops and the boolean logic? If not, that would be the place to start reading.
i know i need to evaluate if x&gt;0, but i'm not sure how to run each value from the inputted vector individually and then get it to stop.
Post the error. 
This is so extraordinarily basic, I have to assume you didn't even attempt to read the documentation. For fucks sake, hit F1. 
If N is odd, there may be a problem calculating "freq" and "dfft". Post the error.
this seems related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20036161/can-we-draw-digital-waveform-graph-with-pyplot-in-python-or-matlab together with http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/stairs.html - Ok, this works: stairs(1:5, [1 0 1 0 1]) And: y = square(2*pi*30*t) gives a better square wave too. And this adds noise: noisySqW = squareWavePos + 3*randn(size(squareWavePos)); from https://www.utdallas.edu/~dlm/3350%20comm%20sys/FFT2.m
for showing code, it is better readable, if you intend code with 4 spaces, e.g.: Error: Invalid equation or initial condition. [ode::splitSys]
It's for the comment on the far top of the script or function and for the headers and sections. If you begin the function with a comment, that will appear in the box, then if you use sections in your code (when ever you write a function with more than 100 lines this is great) those sections are included in the space. At this point you can double click the sections and the cursor is brought to the head of that section. Play around with it, use '%%' more in your functions and see what happens.
Hunh - interesting. I have never known this functionality. Going back now, when I click on a few of my scripts/functions, *some* of them have text in that box. I guess I unknowingly picked up the (good) habit of commenting my work so that it shows, sometimes. Thanks for the tips and the section bit, I'll certainly look making the best use of this notation as I've got 500+ line codes (not very elegant, I know) and could use this type of documentation for myself.
it takes practice, but if you ever end up on a project with another researcher or developer and are building something in matlab, sections are life savers for both you and your team as you organize larger bits of code and algorithms
thankyou for your question, it was an old installation and I realised the issue was to do with a java update. Setting it to use the older version fixed the problem :)
yosemite gm2 here: 2014b works just fine though graphs are not retina. 2014a works if you use beta java and change your OS version number AND run matlab directly through the terminal.
 Undefined function 'sum' for input arguments of type 'struct'. Error in mean (line 28) y = sum(x)/size(x,dim); Error in fft (line 9) dfft = abs(fft(d-mean(d))); It doesn't like the mean for some reason. I am also noticing the variable d is not a vector. So N is just 1 when it should be 1500.

Don't think you can. `parpool` starts a pool of MATLAB processes on machines that are specified in the cluster's description and then distributes the loop iterations among these processes. If you want to do GPU operations you'll need to create a `gpuArray`, write your `parfor` loop as a function and then execute the loop over the `gpuArray` with something like `bsxfun` or `arrayfun`. Relevant doc: http://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/run-element-wise-matlab-code-on-a-gpu.html
It tells you what the issue is right there -- d is a structure. When you call load what you're doing is storing your data in a field within d e.g. d.data. You need to use that as an argument for functions like length, fft, mean, etc to return what you're expecting. 
This sounds like a homework question... Why is the mp3 named LABamba, and why do you need 1000 samples? The code is decently commented and it says the ylabel RIGHT THERE: voltage Go to class, or explain why you're doing this. 
I added the Voltage label myself it doesn't necesarily means voltage. The homework is to get 1000 samples. The rest are for my personal knowledge. mp3 because I chose this file. Don't assume this is a homework question you prick, I'm here for help I'm not getting in class. If you're not willing to answer, then don't comment and GTFO.
Yeah that's not how you get help..
Just because he's made some dodgy assumptions about you, being rude to people like that is a way to make sure you don't get any help. We get a lot of posts here with people expecting us to do their homework for them and as a result some people can be over-zealous trying to pick up on that and nip it in the bud. Calling someone a prick is totally unnecessary. Why don't *you* GTFO until you can improve your attitude? I'm not an expert in this part of Matlab but I will say that the y axis of the data will represent the instantaneous amplitude of the mp3 waveform (proportional to sound intensity, and is, at some point, represented as a voltage signal in a circuit, affecting the speaker behaviour).
The short answer is you can't for a single gpu. You can use parpool to assign a set of computations to a specific GPU if you have more than one in your machine by assigning gpuDevice(parForCounter). ie: parfor count = 1:NumberGPUs gpuDevice(count) data(count) = doStuffOnData(data(count)); end If you want to take advantage of the many cores in the GPU you will need to use the arrayfun, bsxfun, and pagefun functions as mentioned by u/TheIsletOfLangerhans. Additionally some functions, such as fft, will natively use more cores.
\&gt;the homework is to get 1000 samples \&gt;don't assume this is a homework question Are you literally retarded? From the sidebar: &gt;we don't do your homework! \&gt;If you're not willing to answer, then don't comment and GTFO. If you're not willing to participate meaningfully, find another subreddit and GTFO. "Do my homework!" threads are not meaningful participation.
Good catch.
Your comment makes no sense. This specifically states it uses table, but Matlab blocks you from subclassing. For example, if I want to create a specialized table that works on specific groups of columns, or converts columns between specific formats. So this leverages as much as possible from table while providing the possibility to extend the functionality. So yes, I would just use table, but Mathworks...
Came up for me a while ago... This is ugly as sin, but works. (You may have to tweak with the constant titled "offset" a bit... %example.m close all clear all x = linspace(0,1); y = (exp(x*log(2.9)) - 1) * 1e-3; figure; plot(x,y); xlim([0 1]); ylim([0 2e-3]); yt=0:0.2:2; ylab=num2str(yt(:), '%1.1f'); set(gca,'YTickLabel',ylab); pos = get(gca,'Position'); offset = 0.010; %how far to the right you want the exponent annotation('textbox',[pos(1)+offset, pos(2)+pos(4), 0.2, 0.2],... 'Interpreter', 'tex',... 'String', 'x10^{-3}',... 'VerticalAlignment','bottom',... 'EdgeColor','none')
Thanks for this! I am holding off on 2014b until I can get a test build up and make sure everything still works but I will want Yosemite when it comes out (though I won't install the beta)
do you know if you have to have it installed on Mavericks etc, or can you straight up install it on Yosemite?
As agentq512 said, it's because tmp is not a cell array. Dbstep through the code to figure out why this is. 
Installed fine on Yosemite. 
Thank you guys, I'll work on figuring out why it's not a cell array in the function. 
Great, thanks!
It's smooth sailing for me on mint with 2014b. I remember not having a problem with 2013a, also on mint. 
Thanks, it works.
That is just the tip of the iceberg. I have had the same issues on both Ubuntu and Linux Mint, but not Redhat. The windowing issues are prevalent across intel/nvidia hardware. If you look through the stack trace (in the matlab_crash_dump file in your home directory), it looks like the problem is between the java virtual machine (jvm) and shared libraries, an example from my university machine is provided at the end. Starting matlab from the command line with ``-nojvm'' just is not an option. A couple other issues I have had: I have also had some insane problems with the optimization toolbox, specifically repeated calls to quadprog. The problem is not exactly reproducible, but if I run it long enough, it will crash. You will see random processor usage after opening the help documentation. This can be fixed by changing the renderer to ``HTML.'' Yet perhaps the most annoying: on Linux Mint 16, 2013a with Simulink 8.1 and dual monitors, when MATLAB crashes and I have a simulink diagram maximised, when I restart MATLAB, the simulink's ``Position'' variable is changed so that I cannot access the window controls and I cannot move the window. [Here](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/118999-full-screen-in-simulink) is a solution I posted recently.

I think the error is in 'x' - you're passing it the character x.
I'm not entirely sure why you're sorting the letters in your filename and splitting the rails of the read based on whether or not there are an even number of letters in the filename, but it seems like an odd thing to do. Kill the quotes around the letter "x" in the dlmread command and calculate the median using the built-in "median" function, and assign the result to "MedN" (as currently written, you'll get an error telling you that one or more output variables were not assigned, since you never set the value of MedN). If you want to find the median using the sort and length commands, as you seem to have been trying to do, make sure to call the commands on the values read by dlmread (i.e., "l"), not the filename. 
loop over each cell and add a space in to the end of each word then use cell2mat. for i = 1:length(cellswithtext) cellswithtext{i}(end+1) = ' '; end newString = cell2mat(cellswithtext);
okay thank you, I got it. :)
Sorry, I have another question if that's okay. Say for instance, (referring to the cell) I wanted to know which cell 'be' was in, what would the code be?
This might not be the fastest way, but it works: tmp = {'the' 'dog' 'jumped'}; find(~cellfun(@isempty,strfind(tmp,'dog'))) ans = 2
You want want to use strcmp. strfind will return a nonempty index if the pattern is found somewhere in the string. strcmp will return true if the pattern and string are identical. Example: &gt;&gt; tmp = {'the' 'dog' 'jumped'}; &gt;&gt; find(~cellfun(@isempty,strfind(tmp,'do'))) ans = 2 &gt;&gt; find(strcmp(tmp,'do')) ans = Empty matrix: 1-by-0
Have you tried [frontcon.m](http://www.mathworks.com/help/finance/frontcon.html)?
You can use horzcat (and vertcat, at times) when trying to extract cell array contents and repackaging: a = {'the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'} b = horzcat(a{:})
(not really relevant but your answer made me think of it) For those of us who use matlab often, there is the push to vectorize and splice arrays to make things fast and elegant. But sometimes, despite all of that, it is just so much damn easier to do a simple `for` loop with some simple logic. For example, while I haven’t tested it, I am sure there is a way to do what you have in the loop with `cellfun` but yours is just easy! Now if OP had to do this for a million things often, then maybe there are better ways. /end wild tangent
What have you tried so far/where are you stuck?
For a highly optimized function, you could do it in the following fashion: y = (x &gt;= 1 &amp; x &lt; 3) .* (3*x - 1) + ... (x &gt;= 4 &amp; x &lt; 5) .* (2*x) + (x &gt;= 6 &amp; x &lt; 10) .* (6*x-3); This is just zero when `x` is not within the specified intervals. 
You know, I cringed when I wrote that because of the for loop! haha
Check out the help documentation for the [Fast Fourier Transform function(fft)](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft.html?refresh=true). They explain how to implement the function and plot relevant spectra. Should be all you need.
What is *spThrust* and *SFC*? The error is basically telling you that the return value of spThrust has a wrong dimension, in this case meaning it is not scalar
Let's pretend the result is not piecewise-defined, say, y = 3x-1 for all x in [1, 10]. Do you know how to define x and y?
Darn, you beat me to it! Just finished binge watching both seasons, noticed something familiar on the monitor :)
It makes me sad when you guys downvote questions like this. If you don't feel like helping, don't, there's no need to downvote the post so it gets less visibility. I'm a VERY inexperienced Matlab user and I joined this sub to learn from posts like this - it seems like the best way to learn, especially for someone who doesn't necessarily have the time to devote large chunks of it to learning Matlab but really wishes they did. I understand that you want people to put in some effort on their own before asking for help, but when you're really new to it most of the time your sticking point is getting started. The people who responded to this post with help, thank you so much on behalf of new Matlab users trying to learn, you guys are really awesome for taking the time to pass on your knowledge! It seems to me that people who get help learning a skill early on are much more likely to help beginners themselves when they become proficient - it's like paying it forward. 
Since we have some idea of what the pattern of our array needs to be, we know that we have to essentially insert spaces between existing cells. So we can create a new array that has the desired new length (twice the old one, minus 1 if we don't want a trailing space). Then we can stuff the old string into the new one and collect the cells. newString = cell(1,2*numel(oldCellstring)-1); newString(:) = {' '}; %Could also do newString(2:2:end-1) = {' '}; newString(1:2:end) = oldCellstring(:); newString = [newString{:}]; If we wanted to insert different things between the cells it should be easy to see how to modify the newString(:) = {' '} step either inside a loop and/or with different pattern on the RHS.
oh thank you. How would I go about wanting to print a cell? Say if I wanted whatever is in cell 2 how would I write the code?
for the command window you could do something like tmp{2} or slightly fancier: fprintf('%s\n',tmp{2}) 
Matlab isn't 'greedy' in the way you're describing (i.e., seeing how much ram is on your node and trying to use as much as it can). It's only going to use however much RAM is required by your script. Any cluster I've worked on with Torque has behaved the same way; that is, if you go over your time or memory limit, the process is killed and you're SOL. The way around this is to analyze your code and look to see what the maximum memory requirement is, then request the appropriate memory allocation for your job. If you're always going to need more than 10GB of ram, you can either request more by modifying the script you're using to submit the job, or you can modify your analysis script to clear unused variables from memory before creating larger ones that would otherwise put you over your allotment. If you're having trouble figuring out what the culprit is, you can put periodic 'whos' lines in your code, then view the diary for your job after it terminates for unexpectedly large variables in your workspace. Or do something (roughly) like: varlist = whos; membytes = sum(cat(1,varlist.bytes)); if membytes &gt; 9E9 varSize = cat(1,varlist.bytes); [~,I] = max(varSize); %gets your biggest variable. Modify if you want to get the N largest. fprintf('Variable %s is getting prettay prettaaaaay prettaaaaaay big.\n',varlist(I).name) end Furthermore, many HPC clusters have an interactive node you can use for debugging -- you can set a conditional breakpoint that's triggered when whenever the total memory utilization goes above a certain value, then hop in and see what's larger than expected. An alternative possibility is that you are clearing variables but memory isn't being freed in response. I actually have this problem in 2014a when I define variables &gt; 100 GB and then try to clear them. Fortunately, however, we have our own in house high memory machine and don't have to use a scheduler :) (i.e., I haven't bothered looking for a solution). 
Matlab documentation is extraordinarily good. He'd get an answer to this if he just glanced at the documentation. This is just an attempt to get the internet to do his homework. Edit: and for what it's worth, I became an expert user with no assistance but the documentation and plenty of projects to work on. We're not hurting his progress at all. 
&gt; where "keyFunc" is a trivial function, "function" is a relatively low memory function (i.e., data{index} and operations on it are definitely less than 50MB). Also I know that "resultMap" is ~900MB memory and all of the "data" structure is ~500MB. So 10 GB for this script seems much more than sufficient I would verify that all these things are ACTUALLY true. If they really are, then you might be right about the memory leak. If this is the case then there isn't much you can do. 
OK so rather than downvoting how about replying with something like "The Matlab documentation center is very good. To get to it, do x and y. Try searching 'blah' , 'blah' , or 'blah'". Or if you really don't feel like contributing, just ignore the post. 
One option would be to use subplots: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html
I don't know about Python, but you can [absolutely do this with Java](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/using-pure-java-gui-in-deployed-matlab-apps).
What's the name of the file where you have your fft_fun? You call matlab functions by their file names. As for reading XLS data, look at xlsread() or readtable(). Read the documentation for how to read specific cell ranges.
So python has some awesome libraries for working with data in a fashion similar to Matlab. Check out [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) if you're interested. So if you can make a GUI in python you can probably figure out how to use these libraries
Thanks! Will def. take a look today. PANDAS itself looks *veery* interesting, but will probably take me more than a weekend to understand properly. matplotlib looks interesting, is there a equivalent for 3D plots? For instance, is there a [patch function](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/patch.html) in matplotlib? One of the visualization functions I hope to take over is a surface mesh viewer, where the surface can be represented by a series of triangular polygons. From what I'm reading, its (python/qt) better to use if you know what you're doing, but of course it takes a bit of time to learn.
From what I understand matplotlib does 3D plots and I believe it has a patch function/something similar, but I haven't worked with it that extensively to know for sure. [Here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/mplot3d/index.html) are some 3D plot examples. Python is a pretty great language; Matlab is good at somethings, but the amount of libraries that Python allows you to use makes it very powerful.
ok I have figured out everything now except one thing. I have a data set save as a variable 'a' with 3 columns. I need to pull out the first and second columns as different matrices. What is the command to do this? Sorry if I'm asking a lot. 
 first_column=a(:,1); second_column=a(:,2);
You're almost there. The key thing is I'm not sure why you have x=1; % Left side of screen y=1; % Right side of screen x and y should be referring to the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the bottom left corner of the window. So you window goes horizontally from x to x+w, and vertically from y to y+h. You just need to think carefully about what the x and y coordinates should do as you step through the plots. The x coordinate needs to go back to zero every time you go to another row. So if you have n_rows and n_cols, for index n, it would be something like x = mod(n-1,n_cols)*w y = floor((n-1)/n_cols)*h So you can see how x goes from 0 in steps of w until you get to the last column, and then goes back to zero. Whereas y starts at 0, and every time x gets reset to zero, it gets incremented by 1. These commands will go from the bottom row up- to go from the top row down, you need to subtract the above expression from some offset that you calculate based on the screen size. So your final code would look like for n = 1:length(filenames) x = mod(n-1,n_cols)*w y = floor((n-1)/n_cols)*h ... figure('OuterPosition',[x y w h]) end 
So the intersect function is an operator on sets, and sets consist of unique entries. Suppose a = factor(40), b = factor(100). One way of doing this in pseudocode: for entry in a match = intersect(entry,b) if match, then: add entry to LCM remove entry from b Seems like you're getting the problem just fine. The Matlab code for this is fairly straight forward. Note that intersect gives up to three outputs, where the other outputs give you the indices of where the match was in the two inputs. Type help intersect.
MATLAB R2014b introduced the MATLAB Engine for Python. You can use it to call MATLAB code from Python. See: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html
I've made some very large GUI based applications in MATLAB. I recommend using OOP patterns like MVC or MVP to keep the code readable. Also, the table data type is extremely useful.
Thanks!
Do you mind if I ask you some questions, then? I'm taking a look at pyqt, and it looks easier than expected. My main problem in MATLAB deals with code consistency: I'll have random callbacks that don't work after a certain point, axes that spontaneously resize outside of their bounds unexpectedly, and data that after a certain point doesn't translate between GUI's anymore. I've learned everything I know up to this point by following tutorials and looking at a few books, but I'm rapidly realizing unless I learn from someone who really knows their shit I won't get much farther. My problem could just be inexperience, honestly. I do not expect to have all my problems magically disappear by switching languages, but I heard the organization of python/qt is more intuitive, and easier to keep control of. It may be better to just do what I want to do in pyqt.
This occurs when you rely on MATLAB to to do work for you and let it make a lot of assumptions. Instead you need to deal with everything explicitly. Such as manage handles and object hierarchy. For example to make a single figure GUI with an axes and 2 buttons i would make 2 classes. A manager class which implements logic and a view class which creates the GUI and forwards user input to the other class. The view class makes a figure, the axes and the buttons and stores the handles (they are all empty at this point). The manager class owns the view and has access to these handles. The manager class then 'populates' the view objects in some way after they have been created. So manager is created -&gt; manager creates view -&gt; manager populates view. Populate could be: function populate_view(this) % Create a plot in the axes this.handles.plot = plot(this.view.handles.axes,xdata,ydata) end Everything must have a parent. I try to centralise my callbacks. ie. Every graphics object has the same callback with a giant switch statement which decided what to do based on who invoked it. This allows you to separate the actual GUI objects and the actions they perform. MATLAB GUIs come to a crawl when you have multiple axes per figure due to the colormap / colorbar system. Although this may be remedied in 2014b (i'm yet to check). Also, use the 'userdata' property of objects to help you out. For example, to 'link' a slider and edit box you might store the handle to the other in the 'userdata' property. 
Sure, I get this. I don't use OOP, but I can get the hierarchy. I think my problem is the longer my code gets, the more convoluted it gets. When I decide to add another axes, for example, I don't properly code the figure to handle the axes handles. Instead, I try to do that with buttons, etc, which can work if you go in a certain order (or a variety of orders), but its susceptible to bugs. My code re-useability for other applications non-UI oriented is pretty decent, but for GUI's it suddenly flies out the window. My time coding is divided into three main parts: planning, execution and debugging. My planning and debugging steps take about &gt;75% of the time, the actual time it takes me to code what I want is fairly small. As you can probably see, I think my problem is I was never taught a clean, simple way to go about coding interfaces: I just learned as I went along. I also had a tough time telling MATLAB how to handle particular handles: for example, if I have two axes, you can set the current axes handle to a particular axes with: set(figure, 'CurrentAxes', axesname) but how do you make that usage smart? For instance I can push a button saying "switch the handle to this", but if you have a particular app enabled, with the axes handle mistaken, it can cause problems. How can you handle this intelligently? That being said, I have two main questions. For one, do you have a good tutorial/source (book or otherwise) that details this process of coding interfaces in particular? Clean coding will likely solve the problems I have. Unfortunately, integrating OOP will likely take a bit longer since I don't have much experience with it. I have some tutorials, but its a bit complicated/will take a bit of time to process well. Secondly, the reason I wanted to do py/qt in the first place is the language is a lot more intuitive, and qt is fantastic for interfaces. There are a lot of things I don't like about MATLAB visualization, clean code aside (the visualization for what I have is much, much slower and feels bulkier compared to third-party software). I imagine py/qt will have faster, more crisp visualizations, especially for large files (I do a lot of visualizations of large meshes/geometries, which can be pretty slow). On the other hand, MATLAB simplifies a lot of math I need to do.
You basically want it to be stateless. i.e. The order in which functions are called or things are clicked doesn't necessarily matter. This is very difficult to do without using objects (i.e. one giant function). This is a good reference yo get you started on the architecture of a good GUI: http://myunscriptedblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/mvc-in-matlab.html Also MATLAB has a massive document on OOP stuff: http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/pdf_doc/matlab/matlab_oop.pdf
Thank you very much! I will probably look at pyqt and this concurrently, to see which one works better. This looks like it can solve a lot of problems that I have right now though.
Use figure('units', 'normal','position',[0 0 .5 .5]) then the figure is scaled as a percentage of your monitor. Over 100% will get you to second monitor. I thinks you might want subplot like Tau suggested
I think I love you. Thank you so much! 
set(0,'RecursionLimit',N)
Can you just restart MATLAB, or did you set it as a default?
Try changing the output format to "long". This displays 15 digits, instead of truncating at 5 digits in the "short" format style. For example, format short [linspace(6,60,10), 0.00001, 0.00008] outputs the following: Columns 1 through 7 6.0000 12.0000 18.0000 24.0000 30.0000 36.0000 42.0000 Columns 8 through 12 48.0000 54.0000 60.0000 0.0000 0.0001 If you change the formatting to long, format long [linspace(6,60,10), 0.00001, 0.00008] Matlab outputs the following: Columns 1 through 3 6.000000000000000 12.000000000000000 18.000000000000000 Columns 4 through 6 24.000000000000000 30.000000000000000 36.000000000000000 Columns 7 through 9 42.000000000000000 48.000000000000000 54.000000000000000 Columns 10 through 12 60.000000000000000 0.000010000000000 0.000080000000000
Bit late to the party, but yes can confirm it works on Yosemite unpatched.
Do you know of a way to specify which monitor figures are opened in? I've got two and use the "main" monitor (orig. with comp. tower) as my Win desktop and use the second on the side as my MATLAB session, however, all plots are opened (on top of eachother, I'll read through how to unstack them) in that "main" monitor, overlaying any other applications I've got running. It's not a huge annoyance, but would be more convient if I could have them open in the same monitor as the MATLAB session.
I tried but I still ended up with the same numbers. I'm going to double check that I entered the formula correctly.
Yes just make the horizontal normalized position greater than 1.
It looks like your variable "t" is just a handle (a number, not an object). You have to use set and get to access the data. You might be looking at code examples for the new version of Matlab (2014b) which changes the way graphics handles work
Sounds like you want [`subs`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html). Alternatively, you could create a function in a separate file that returns four times the input squared and call that function for each 'y' value you need to calculate.
Try an anonymous function: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html &gt;&gt; y=@(x) x^2+3*x^2 y = @(x)x^2+3*x^2 &gt;&gt; y(10) ans = 400
Exactly what I am looking for. Thanks a lot.
Using external function is a nice solution either. Thank you.
Thanks! I'm a bit of a noob! Could you please give a detailed response if/when you get some time? Thanks!
Do you remember piece-wise functions from middle school math? ...and you would just hand draw them on your HW: y = x+4 for x &lt;= 2 y = x^2 for 2 &lt; x &lt;= 10 y = log_10(x) for x &gt; 10 This seems like a more complex extension of that and you can construct your Z-surface matrix as such. If you want different colors I would do: x1 = -4:0.01:0; % surface 1 domain is -4&lt;x&lt;0, -4&lt;y&lt;-2 y1 = -4:0.01:-2; x2 = 0.01:0.01:4; % surface 2 domain is 0.01&lt;x&lt;4, -1.99&lt;y&lt;4 y2 = -1.99:0.01:4; z1 = % make your first domain-restricted surface z2 = % 2nd surface c1 = [1 0 0]; % red surface c2 = [0 0 1]; % blue surface figure(1) hold on % note you'll need this otherwise the last surface plotted will be the only one you see as each plotting call for a given figure superceeds the last one surf(x1,y1,z1,c1) surf(x2,y2,z2,c2) Here's a brief bit from the [surf()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/surf.html) documentation that describes the color part: &gt;surf(Z,C) plots the height of Z, a single-valued function defined over a geometrically rectangular grid, and uses matrix C, assumed to be the same size as Z, to color the surface. [See Coloring Mesh and Surface Plots for information on defining C.](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/visualize/coloring-mesh-and-surface-plots.html) *Edit: I just noticed that C needs to be the same size as Z, so the above code won't quite work but lays out the method. Check out the link to the colors of surf plots in the quoted text above about making a color for each Z-value. There may be an easier way to get about the color parts (ie. if you just want two different colors for the two pieces) than to make a RGB values for each Z, but at least here's a starting point, and is where I would begin as well.
I can't think of a way to read selectively like that. I suggest just reading the whole file. You can just pick out the columns you want afterwards and dump the rest. 
How would I do that?
Check the format specification for [fscanf()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fscanf.html#inputarg_formatSpec) - it provides ways to skip specified inputs. *Edit: in doing so you completely eliminate the need for both for loops in your reading.
I *may* have had the wrong idea that an astrisk character skips an input with fscanf. [Here](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/import-text-data-files-with-low-level-io.html#f5-6432) is another section of documentation using fscanf() to input specific cols/rows.

I initially also thought that [textscan()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/textscan.html) was the way to go, but got side tracked. You may read through it and consider if it is a better method for your application.
No, thank you.
Well as your OP has/had it you were reading a singular value each time. Was that completely filling your array with 8-yrs and N-values per year? If so you could just nullify the values you don't want: a = [10 20 30 40 50 60]; a(1:3) = []; &gt;&gt; a a = 40 50 60 I think is how that would work. Not at a terminal at the moment.
I tried it, but it's telling me "Index exceeds matrix dimensions." 
2 thoughts: 1st, is the reason your TriScatteredInterp method doesn't is because it's extrapolating values in regions that you don't calculate values? If so, you can turn the extrapolation off and it should take care of it. In this case, if you initialize your grid for TriScatteredInterp as zeros, the plot should come out correctly. 2nd, if that doesn't work, you could go about setting values as zeros by looking at your coordinate system and calculating the radius. for any radius smaller than your donut, set to zero. You can calculate the x and y values with a triscattered interp of the original coordinate data in order to calculate the radii. Hope it helps.
Did you try this (again, not positive it'll work but trouble shooting it should) or modify the method to your working?
Interesting problem. I wonder if the rng that is used to resample your data for tree generation is not the default rng? That would mean your explicit seed setting doesn't do what you want. Also, are you sure they are using the same rng algorithm? Mersene-twister has been standard for a while, but if some versions or architectures use something else, who knows? 
Thank you for your reply. Yes, it's extrapolating values for the area in the middle of the donut, which I do not want. How do I turn the extrapolation off? Would I create a mesh of zero's first then insert the TriScatteredInterp values in after? This seems like if it worked, would be a much easier fix than the 2nd point. I was initially thinking about your second point. The tricky part would be locating the centre of the circle on the interpolated mesh. But if I could do that, then I could implement something using this idea? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/481144/equation-for-testing-if-a-point-is-inside-a-circle At the moment my TriScatteredInterp code is: F = TriScatteredInterp(xcoord,ycoord,zcoord); %zcoord is my pressure values tix = -r1:0.1:r1; %makes a square mesh as big as the whole circle tiy = -r1:0.1:r1; [qx,qy] = meshgrid(tix,tiy); qz = F(qx,qy); contourf(qz) %interpolated mesh Thank you so much!
I'm not completely sure, but I think this is what you're looking for: first_idx = find(o,1,'first');
Alternatively you (OP) could: o = m(n); o(1) Not sure what is faster, and if your arrays are small the difference of 1-2 ms wouldn't make much of a difference. *Edit: I'm an idiot at 130a. n is a singular value (5), so m(n) gets the 5th element. I was meaning to type: m = m(o); m(1); Alternatively you could also have: m = m(m&gt;n); m(1);
If this was a one-off data munge, I'd use awk first.
Been a while since I've done Matlab, but approaching it from a numerical analysis standpoint, is there anything in the code that could cause rounding/floating point errors, which would be different due to the different epsilon_mach (machine precision) of different machines? 
I've actually been using the scatteredinterpolant function which supercedes the triscatteredinterp, and in that you can specify the extrapolation method to be 'none'. Sounds like the way to go... hopefully you have a recent enough version of Matlab.
I was just reading about that, I don't have a recent enough version but I will try to upgrade so I can give that a go. Apart from the extrapolation, does anything else change? Or could I just swap the triscatteredinterp to scatteredinterpolant in my code?
Is all the source data in the code itself or is it pulling from a text/excel/etc file? The only reason I thought to ask is because I've done this before when switching between a personal and school computer. Spent 2 days pulling my hair wondering what the magic gnomes were doing to my calculations. Turned out, I forgot to copy over the updated source data. 
This is entirely possible depending on a few things that you don't mention. Can you provide some info regarding the matlab version(s), OS type/version, and CPU on each machine? 
~~This doesn't really make sense as a general solution.~~ edit per edit
You can use [`setenv`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/setenv.html) and [`getenv`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/getenv.html) with [`cd`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cd.html), though it's not quite as elegant. For example: setenv('MYDIR','C:\Really long file path'); cd(getenv('MYDIR')); It's using your system variables so you should be able to use `getenv` on its own if they're already defined.
This is cool -- I didn't know about get/setenv. Thanks!
Use textscan. It is the best for this sort of file. First, read a single line with format string fs = repmat('%f', 1, 8); and find which columns are 2003 and 2004. Then construct your format string: fs = '%*f%*f....%f%f...%*f' where the %*f means skip this column of floats and %f means read this column of floats. Then run textscan again with this new format string and do not specify how many rows to read.
Lol. I was exhausted when I posted that at 130a. Didn't even cross my mind that n is the constraint to be GT or LT. I should have typed either: m = m(m&gt;n) m = m(o) then m(1) Thanks for keeping me on my toes.
I see you already found out how to draw a square wave but just to clarify what went wrong in your first example: linspace(A,B,N) gives N numbers equally devided between the range of A and B. So linspace(1,1,5) just returns a bunch of ones. If you'd use linspace(1,2,5) you would get a triangle wave. To get a square wave you would need to duplicate every value of that vector. But you have already noticed that there are way easier ways to draw a square wave. 
In Matlab any variable can be an "environmental variable" (the way you are using them). cwd=cd('C:\do something'); cd(cwd); Or you can setup any paths you want in your startup.m HOME="C:\my home" PROJ1="C:\project1" cd(HOME) cd(PROJ1) Matlab also understands relative directories and tab completion. cd ../&lt;TAB&gt; And it will bring up available options: http://i.imgur.com/bwsNWFz.png 
:) Just a note on the edits: these will give you the values, not the indices.
As for trying to help even with the code barfed onto the post... You are roughly on the right track but I immediately see some issues (though these may be in comments. I really can't tell from your work). `40&lt;i&lt;60 &amp;&amp; 40&lt;j&lt;60` is not proper Matlab syntax. Or is at least bound to fail. Consider the following example: for i = 1:10 t1 = 3 &lt; i &lt;= 8; t2 = all([3&lt;i i&lt;=8]); disp([i t1 t2]); end You'll notice none of the conditions is met. Other concerns: * why is your stopping criteria only at `(100,100)`. Try `a = T; ...(code)... b = T; err = rms(a(:) - b(:));` to use the root-mean-square over the entire domain. * why aren’t you calling anything in `contourf`? * Work out the math by hand. Your finite-difference eqn looks good in more of the domain. It is hard to read it/follow it around the Neumann (q-dot) condition in the center. (it has also been a long time since I did this stuff so I do not recall the exact forms) * You do not define `T` before the first iteration for `a` I hope this helps **edit:** Fixed minor typo in example code
I think I fixed it.
*(100,100) represents the outer most node if you were to plot a 100X100 matrix of points *I was having a lot of difficulty with the inequalities, my professor told me to use the conditional loop for the heat generation in the center, I just did not know how to write it. *have not called anything in contourf because honestly I am not sure what variables to call. Thank you for the help, it's getting me somewhere.
I see in the mean time you cleaned up the code. Much easier to read. A few more things: * why do you have `i= (1:100);` right below the declaration of `for i = (1:100)`? * You're never looping over all `i` and `j` (or I am missing it). so you're only at the boundaries. (also, no need to do these in loops but for now, use loops since it is easier for a new matlab user) Work through exactly what needs to happen at each iteration. Write out the math by hand with the algorithm. Hell, even try writing the code with pseuocode by hand to get the gist^1. Also, make sure you're accessing every part of the array in your loops. Finally, watch out for [fencepost error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error). (of course, [relevant XKCD reference](http://imgs.xkcd.com/clickdrag/1n9e.png)) ^(1: Not usually a doable practice but if you're really stuck on coding errors, it may help)

One more question, if I want to make this code run for 10^5 iterations how would I write that?
you had it. for iter = 1:1e5 (your code) if (some convergence criteria) break; end end is fine. 
I made some edits, looks like my code is getting hung up on my equations, I'll have to figure out what is happening with that. Thanks for the help!
Can you edit it to reflect your current code including all changes you made so far and add a comment on which part you think is the most unclear to you? I will try to help you in a bit when im back from shopping groceries ;-)
But OP wanted the value (6), not the indices :)
I guess it'll depend on how you parse the question, with the index being the same as the value in the example it's not very well posed :p
Then your professor needs to reword his problem because it's poorly worded. Del=1/100 is NOT the same as "100x100" grid.
You have the following: for i = (2:99) j = (2:99); But I think you meant: for i = (2:99) for j = (2:99);
&gt; err = rms(a(100:100)-b(100:100)); also doesn't make any sense still. The `rms` of 1 number is the number. The idea of using `rms` is that you will consider the entire domain. Try err = rms(a(:)-b(:));
and &gt; if all([0&lt;i i&lt;60 40&lt;j j&lt;60]) is right for `0&lt;i&lt;60` but looking at your problem, is that what you want? I am guessing this is that center thing in the domain in which case it is not `0&lt;i&lt;60` but `40&lt;i&lt;60` or something like that. In that case, you want if all([40&lt;i i&lt;60 40&lt;j j&lt;60]) And you may want `&lt;=` but I really don't know.
&gt; Don't use loops for solving for each point. Don't use loops for assigning initial conditions. I agree 100% that it is better to not use loops. But if OP is really struggling with the algorithms and the syntax, then trying to teach him that for i = 2:99 for j = 2:99 T(i,j) = 1/4 * (T(i+1,J) + T(i-1,j) + T(i,j+1) + T(i,j-1)); end end is the same as: ii = 2:99; jj = 2:99; % Could use ii for square but this is less error-prone later T(ii,jj) = 1/4 .* (T(ii+1,jj) + T(ii-1,jj) + T(ii,jj+1) + T(ii,jj-1)); Isn't going to help with the *fundamental* problems of the science (solving the PDE) or even using Matlab. But with that said, once OP has this finished, it would be an **extremely valuable** exercise to figure out how to *vectorize* the code. Then maybe next time, he can start that way. (BTW, OP, use this example as a hint on how you may go about it but note that you will have to change it for your exact problem. Also, try typing in things like `T(2:10,5:30)` or something into Matlab to understand how you're doing matrix-wise operations and how it is splicing) **EDIT** *(to address your edit)*: Whether or not `T(i,j)` should also be on the RHS depends on the PDE. If it is purly a Laplace equation, I do not think it has `T(i,j)` and is instead just the boundary. Otherwise, if you start with `T(i,j)` as anything but zero, it will never convegre. It is different for a Possion Equation. I actually tested this by coding a super-simple example below. OP, You can also use this as a good example. One of the ways to learn is to read examples and adapt them. This is NOT me doing your work since in order to modify it for your problem (which is a lot harder), you really need to understand what I am doing. T = zeros(100); T(:,1) = 10; T(:,end) = 0; T(1,:) = 0; T(end,:) = 0; T2 = T; ii = 2:99; jj = 2:99; err = Inf; for iter = 1:1e5 a = T; T(ii,jj) = 1/4 .* ( T(ii+1,jj) + T(ii-1,jj) + T(ii,jj+1) + T(ii,jj-1) ); T2(ii,jj) = T2(ii,jj) + 1/4 .* ( T2(ii+1,jj) + T2(ii-1,jj) + T2(ii,jj+1) + ... T2(ii,jj-1) ); b = T; err = rms(a(:) - b(:)); if err &lt;= 1e-6 fprintf('Convegred. RMS err = %e, iter = %i\n',err,iter) break end end contourf(T) You'll notice that `T2` will be way off by the end (and if you did the check with `T2`, it won’t converge)
&gt; It makes the code so much cleaner that it's easier to read (in my opinion). That's true. And I agree. I just don't think it should be OP's first (or second, or 10th) concern at the moment. 
Ok. So you have 2(very) different tasks you need to solve: - Select a directory and display file names in that directory. - take the 3rd pixel from a bunch of images and put it into a new matrix. Can you solve 1 of these two problems? (or maybe both!) What have you tried? How far did you get?
Do you mean a for loop? What is your specific problem?
Yes, I meant a for loop. Basically, I don't know how you turn the output of the files within the directory into something that you can go through one by one.
 folder = 'C:\your\folder\path\'; imgFileExt = '.tif'; % Or .jpg, .png... will pick just that file type out files = dir(strcat(folder, '*', imgFileExt)); pixelMatrix = zeros(length(files), 3); % assuming you have MxNx3 color images. Change '3' to '1' for grayscale. for k = 1:length(files) img = imread(files(k).name); pixelMatrix(k, :) = img(3); % pick out third pixel end 
If i remember correctly it's a pretty simple swap if you have to change anything... I had to make the transition when i did my upgrade and it was pretty simple. 
Use .* instead of *. If this does not solve it please add your code to your post.
I am 99% sure your issue is with the operations as another user pointed out. `*` performs a matrix multiplication and has the required rules. Consider the following examples. Make sure they make sense to you what is happening % Will work (both square) A = [1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]; B = [10 11 12;13 14 15;16 17 18]; C1 = A * B; C2 = A .* B; disp(C1); disp(C2); % 1D vectors A = [1 2 3]; B = [4 5 6]; C1 = A .* B; % The following will fail and is commented %C2 = A * B C3 = A' * B; % Will be a 3x3 since A' is 3x1.(3x1 * 1x3 = 3x3) C4 = A * B'; % Will be 1x1 (1x3 * 3x1 = 1x1). == dot(A,B) disp(C1); disp(C3); disp(C4); So when you have a plot code that is something as follows, notice you *must* use `.*` x = linspace(0,2*pi,300); g = x.^2+1; f = sin(x); h = f ./ g; plot(x,h,'-','LineWidth',2,'color','k')
The answer to your question of "why," is that Matlab defaults to matrix multiplication. You can't multiply [1 2 3] * [1 2 3] (Error: Inner matrix dimensions must agree.) You can multiply [1 2 3] * [1; 2; 3] = 14 What you want to do is element by element multiplication and divison. You tell Matlab to do this by putting a period before your * or /: [1 2 3] .* [1 2 3] = [1 4 9]
xlswrite will work, but you'll have to work on the syntax a little bit to put everything in the right rows and columns
I think you'll have to post the code you've written so far and explain what you want it to do that it doesn't do.
also you can do [1 2 3] * [1 2 3]' (with the dash)

Here's one example: [Newton's method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method). The first paragraph gives a good description of the method while the first picture depicts each iteration and how you (might) close in on m such that f(m) is closest. You might pick two values that sandwitch the true value, and testing both values will give you who's closer to zero. There are drawbacks to Newton's method, as with all numerical analysis techniques.

This is exactly what I've been trying to do and it makes total sense but it keeps saying empty matrix 1 x 0
This was my initial thought as well but my professor told us there to use the abs and min function. Also we haven't learned loops yet
First, you may want to change the images to RGB since you will probably end up with 16 forget colormaps that don't correspond. RGB = ind2rgb(X,map); Then, before your k loop, initialize your new image NewImage = zeros(1000,1000,3); Then in your k loop, set your indices as x1=place(k,1); x2=(k,2); etc for x3, x4 NewImage(x1:x2,x3:x4,:)=RGB(:,:,:); I hope you get the idea. Please excuse any typos, typing on a phone.
You will get an empty matrix 1x0 when the value you are trying to find doesn't exist in the vector you are searching
ok. so you want to fit a polynomial to several datapoints. Have you tried [This?](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=matlab+polynomial+fit).
Ah, Polyfit is the easiest polynomial fitting function there is :P. However! You mention that you know the functions? Could you give a bit more background on that? Or be a bit more descriptive about your problem? So: What is the problem? (What do you want as an output?) and What do you have? (datapoints, functions, code you already wrote).
&gt; It's the link in the description Yes, we see that. We're not in you class so we're not going to do your homework. We're happy to help you while *you* do your homework. What have you tried so far? We can't read your mind. Have you gone with the polyfit() route or are you hard coding your 3 equations you say you know? How would you do this by hand? Do you have any code? Recieving any errors? For readability, please include 4 spaces before every line you want displayed as code
No no no no. Xlswrite creates a com server, opens the file, writes the values, saves the file, closes the file and destroys the com server--every time you call it, with no way to save the com server, much less to leave the file open or wait to save it until you're done writing. If you want to write to an excel file from Matlab, hack the xlsread/xlswrite functions to pull the code you need into a seperate function/class that allows you to leave the com server and file open between read/write calls. I'd send you the code, but I don't have it on a system that can get to the Internet. It's pretty straightforward to implement, though, particularly with the code and comments from the built-in functions. There may be code on the file exchange to do this, too. It should be pretty direct to go from a uitable to an Excel file--the COM server cell value assignment can take cells containing text or numbers directly, so simply assign the values you want to save from the table to the desired location in the spreadsheet. 
Ah i didn't realize it was a link. Eeh, all i see is a blurry picture of a graph. Could you give the literal question. And all the data. And take a look at Halsey117's comment. We'd love to help but "I'm so confused" doesn't really give us something to grasp on. I'm kinda confused now too!
I believe that you also have to have t as the first input to your function, even if you never use it
Instead of searching for an exact match, you could use some threshold as your criteria, like abs( f(m) ) &lt; 1e-3.
thanks for the clarifications!
Are you saying no just because you think it will be a waste of time to call xlsread multiple times? I will look into modifying the xlsread code. I never thought to try that, but I usually do all my excel writing in one shot.
The min function gives you the value and the index at which a vector has the smallest value. Therefore, [value index]=min(abs(f(m))) should do the trick. 
Also, OP, what is the math involved? If you're looking for help translating equations to MATLAB, give them to us to help you along.
You need row,column indexing with your list. for rr = 1:size(list,1) % new canvas canvas=imread(['canvas', '.bmp']); NewName = fullfile(list{rr,1}, '.bmp'); for cc = 2:size(list,2) [X, map] = imread(fullfile(list{rr,cc}, '.bmp')); % if these are BMP, you probably don't need "map." % do your placement in the canvas here end imwrite(canvas, NewName); end
How committed to Matlab are you? The [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) command [montage](http://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/create-a-photo-montage-with-imagemagick/) sounds like it does exactly what you want to do, in a much easier &amp; faster way.
Everything in ODE45 has to be a 1st order differential equation in the generic form of ```x' = Ax```. Where x is a vector and A is a matrix. x is where all your 'terms' are. Your linear equations don't even have to be related as long as they fit the form ```x' = Ax```. http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/class/Math251/Notes-LinearSystems.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0kCxTMBRRU

What I would do is figure out a threshold amplitude for your signal and represent it as a logical vector (or convert it to double, or whatever). Now, where it's 1, it's suprathreshold (on) and where it's zero, it's off. Actually it looks like you've done this. Good. Next, use run length encoding (RLE) to compress the vector (ex code, but you can use whatever incarnation you'd like: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4955-rle-de-encoding). The code is surprisingly elegant and computationally light. I love it. after running RLE, if you had a vector that was 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0, it would then be represented as [0 1 0] and [3 2 5], where the first vector gives you the value, and the second vector gives you the corresponding run length for that value (e.g., 3 0's, 2 1's, then 5 0's). Next, find all your 1's from the first vector, and use those indices to get the corresponding run lengths from the second vector. If the run length is below a certain threshold, set the corresponding value in the first vector to 0. Now, decompress the data using RLE. This might look something like this, where r1 is your value vector and r2 is your run length vector. r1ind = r1==1; r2ind = r2 &lt; RunLengthThreshold; r1(r1ind &amp; r2ind) = 0; %now use RLE to get your decompressed vector. If your threshold was 3 or greater for inclusion, and your original vector was [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0], then your compressed version would be [0 1 0 1 0] [2 5 1 2 3]. The run lengths for your 1's are 5 and 2. Modify the compressed data to [ 0 1 0 0 0] [2 5 1 2 3], then decompress it and you get [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]. Now you got rid of your spurious spikes. edit: despite all the text, this can all be done in about 5 simple lines of code. An alternative would be to use a smoothing filter like Savitzky–Golay, and then do your thresholding. The choice of appropriate parameters using this method might be a little more tricky to generalize, though -- you'll probably 'blur' the edges of your cutoffs more than you'd like. 
Matlab was originally designed to provide an easy-to-use interface to standard Linear Algebra libraries such as LINPACK/EISPACK and today it's LAPACK. For many other numerical routines they usually provide the references which specific algorithm was implemented.
Let's assume the domain is the unit square... go with whatever he tells you. &gt;x = linspace(0,1); &gt; &gt; [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,x); #it's making a 100x100 square Write an inline function : &gt; f = @(x,y) 8*y. ^ 2 - y. ^ 4 - 2*x; Evaluate that function over the mesh: &gt; &gt; Z = f(X,Y); Plot the results: &gt; &gt;surf(Z)
The dots in the inline function: "y. ^ 2" distinguish linear algebra syntax from array multiplication (where each term is multiplied directly.) Example: A = [0,1;0,1]*[0,1;0,2] = [0,2;0,2]; A = [0,1;0,1].*[0,1;0,2] = [0,1;0,2] Edit: Both were edited to add spacing between the ^ operators for readability. Remove these spaces if you intend to copy/paste the code.
What have you tried? Do you have any errors? If you post code, please put 4 spaces before lines you want displayed as code We'll help *you* do your HW, but we won't do your HW for you.
Wow you are a genius. All that time and it was such a simple solution. Thank you!
I was about to say that it doesn't really matter how OP transposes his matrices, and that he should do it however seems cleanest, clearest, and most consistent with the other functions he will be using. But this is actually a (the only?) valid argument for one way being better than any other. I wouldn't have thought to check for a memory access issue. Well done. 
Yes. Xlsread and xlswrite are okay for a single call, but any time you will be doing multiple read/writes to the file (or to different files), simply creating the COM server each time adds gratuitous overhead. If the file is large, the open/save/close operations become significant, too. If you're not confortable creating a class to handle the interface, is recommend adding inputs to xls[read/write] to force the function to keep the COM server and file open between calls (just remember to close the file when you're done), and add both as outputs from xls[read/write] so you can use them. Note that Excel has documentation on many of the COM server properties and methods--enable the developer options and look in the visual basic help for what you need. 
Matlab is a "column-major order" program, in that the columns are stored in contiguous memory on your computer. Therefore, you should try to use your N x 3 format instead of 3 x N format for Matlab. I believe this in general leads to slight improvements in computation times since accessing contiguous elements is faster than accessing non-contiguous elements.
For storage it helps if you can figure out the size of the data and preallocate. I was able to speed it up significantly by throwing in a one liner of perl/unix to count the number of lines in the data file and preallocate the array rather than concatenating the chunks. 
What format is your .dat file? .dat is just an extension and could mean anything. Is it plain text? Is it binary? Either way, how is the data formatted inside the file?
STALKER. But you're right. That's another benefit of bringing in fixed sized blocks as well. Pre-allocation is simple. Now if only I could remember to do zeros(10000,1); instead of just zeros(10000). One of these things is not like the others. Also, we're hiring people here and in London. $8k referral bonus if you go to London, $5k here. You already know the salaries. You want out?
Not sure if this actually helps you, but you could use syms functions syms x y(x)=x^2+x-6 y2(x)=y/(x-2) and check if it works out mathematically y(4) y2(4) Looks good. And typing: y2 gives you what the resulting function is. y2(x) = (x^2 + x - 6)/(x - 2) Hope it helps. 
 b = [ 1 , 1 , -6 ] a = [ 1 , -2 ] [ r , p , k ] = residue( b , a ) [ b2 , a2 ] = residue( r , p , k ) Is one way, then you have the coefficients of the resulting polynomial and y2 = @( x ) polyval( b, x ) ./ polyval( a, x ) Will give you the result you seek. Note that b2 and a2 are the simplified polynomial coefficients.
you can also make the function handle an argument to a 2nd function handle. like this: &gt;&gt; f1 = @(x) x^2 + x - 6; &gt;&gt; f2 = @(f,x) f(x) / (x-2); &gt;&gt; f2(f1,10) ans = 13 So now you can divide any function by (x-2) and that division step isn't tied to the original function. hope this helps.
Try using audiowrite instead. The syntax would be: audiowrite(strcat('/Users/Jurgen/Documents/MATLAB/',wavefn,'.wav'),[wavefilesplit],Fs)
So, first of all, let me just say -- this is not great Matlab code. There are a bunch of kind of weird/amateur-y things about it, and although it will run, you get a lot of warnings and such because it does several things that you aren't really supposed to do. Not accusing you because, as you said, you got it online and are new to Matlab -- just an FYI that the code you found is not great code. That said -- I just plugged it in to my copy of Matlab and cleaned it up a little bit, and it does work. I'm not sure if the following is a formatting issue from pasting the code into Reddit or if it's there in your actual code... but if it's the latter, this might solve your problem. Check out the line you have as: for i=1:Fs/2:size_r, %build array of desired ranges j(end+1,:)=i; The `%` character denotes a comment, but after the word `ranges` you have some actual code. With that code on the same line as the comment, that `for` loop (which is essentially finding the boundaries to chunk the file into half-second segments) does nothing. Thus, you end up with 0 chunks and writing no files. To fix that, the loop should instead look like this: for i=1:Fs/2:size_r, %build array of desired ranges j(end+1,:)=i; end If that doesn't fix it, let me know and we can go deeper. Again, it sort of pains me (as a lover of the Matlab language and good programming style) not to go to town on all the other stylistic and programming issues this code chunk has... but if you're just trying to do the thing you're doing and not trying to learn Matlab in general, I'll spare you the lectures.
wow, thank you for your time :) it's amazing that people like you actually give some of their precious time to help out others. I do understand that it might not be the best code. If you were to be a bit more detailed, what would you change, rather focus on in order to make it a bit better?
As what you're trying to do is quite simple, I would recommend starting from scratch, as you'd learn a lot in the process. You can probably achieve this in just a few lines. 
I'm surprised that nobody has given you the simple solution. Well, it's simple, but subtle and a little bit deep. You see, anonymous functions like the one you have written work like *closures* which means they keep a static copy of the workspace at the time they were created. This allows you to use variables that are defined in your workspace inside your anonymous function. So all you need to do is y = @(x) x^2 + x - 6 y2 = @(x) y(x)/(x-2) And y2 is now a function that does what you want. The key thing is that on the second line, 'y' refers to the variable/function that is already defined in the workspace. A simpler example might be a function to add a constant to a number: a = 2 fcn = @(x) x+a So you can see how the anonymous function fcn() is able to use the current value of a, even though it is not one of the arguments to the function. The 'static' part of the closure means that you can do clear y in your workspace, and the function y2 will still work fine. Similarly, if you did a = 3 after declaring fcn(), you would find that fcn() still adds 2, because it uses the value of a *at the time fcn was created*
Here are a few things -- there could be more. I'll annotate lines as I go -- if I don't mention one, assume it's basically OK. [y, Fs, nbits] = wavread(strcat(filepathStr,fileStr)); This one is all-right-ish but it could be better -- replace `strcat` with `fullfile`, which is more robust because it is platform-independent and it does the right thing even if you forget to put the trailing slash on `filepathStr`. Oh, and you don't need `nbits` since the way the code is written now, `nbits` isn't used anywhere (`wavwrite` at the end is just told to write everything 16-bit, which is what that 16 in the `wavwrite` line means). Thus, I'd suggest changing that line to: [y, Fs] = wavread(fullfile(filepathStr,fileStr)); Next up: [size_r,size_c]=size(y); OK except, similar to `nbits`, you don't really need `size_c` as it's never used. So you could just write `size_r=size(y,1);` to get the same effect. j=[]; k=0; wavefilesplit=[]; for i=1:Fs/2:size_r, %build array of desired ranges j(end+1,:)=i; end j(end+1,:)=size_r; Lots wrong here! To start, we don't really need any of those first three lines since `wavefilesplit` gets defined elsewhere and doesn't need to be initialized to an empty matrix, `k` won't be needed once we clean up the code below, and `j` can be calculated a better way. Next: A couple things wrong with the `for` loop. 1) If your sampling rate is an odd number (which it easily could be -- 11025 is a not-uncommon sampling rate for audio), it can produce non-integer matrix indices in `j`, which is a no-no in Matlab. It'll actually let you do it with a warning (by rounding to the nearest integer), but it's definitely not good practice and usually means there is something wrong with your code. 2) This loop doesn't even really need to exist. A better way to create `j` would be to do something like: j = 1:round(Fs/2):size_r; That does everything the `for` loop does in one line of code that will run faster and is better Matlab style, and also doesn't have the non-integer problem. To get the final value of j, you could tack on: j = [j size_r]; ... but actually, you could also leave that line out because later suggestions I am going to make will make it irrelevant. Actually -- the way I'd *really* suggest writing this code, you wouldn't need to create the variable `j` at all -- but let's leave it in for now so we don't veer too far away from the way the code was originally written. By the way, that `Fs/2` bit is basically dividing up your file into half-second chunks... i.e., `Fs` is your sampling rate (say, 44100 samples per second if it's CD-quality audio), so dividing that by 2 means that you'd have 22050 samples in each chunk, making them a half-second long. If you wanted a different chunk length, you could define a variable up at the top of the file like: chunk_length = 0.7; %in seconds, i.e. 0.7 is 7/10 of a second And then the line that creates `j` would become: j = 1:round(Fs*chunk_length):size_r; This is getting long and I should be going to bed soon... so maybe I can pick up in the morning? It's a fun exercise though.
Oh that's a cool solution. However, what I've just realized is that, I actually want this (x-2) to factor out the (x-2) part on the numerator. So, I'll end up with (x+3) and when I plug y2(2) I need to have the solution of 5, but what I get is NaN obviously since the denominator is (x-2). How can I tackle this problem ?
This is laughably wrong. Google doesn't care about which languages you know, and MATLAB is one of the worst in almost every way besides that.
A machine learning engineer from Google said he used to use MATLAB all the time when he was in academia but had to stop once he got to Google because they didn't want to pay the license. I think he said he has to use R now. 
I question whether Google would deny it on the basis of money. My guess would be that it just didn't meet the quality standards that they needed from their software.
Right now you're plotting a single number at a time. It is much, much faster to store all the values in a vector and just plot them once at the end. So your "end" command should be before the plotting commands, and change theta, vc, vci,vcii, to vectors. Move your definition of theta up above the start of the for loop, and then iterate over i=1:theta. You'll also need to change all the references from theta, vc, etc. to theta(i), vc(i), etc. inside of the for loop. 
OK, I'm back to finish the job! Next up: [size_rj,size_cj]=size(j); %used to get size of j array This is OK, but once more, `size_cj` isn't actually used so we don't need it. Could just do `size_rj = size(j,1)` for the same effect. And again, there are better ways to do this whole thing, but I'll leave that for later. for i=1:1:size_rj-1,k=k+1; wavefilesplit=y(j(k):j(k+1),:); %get range from j array example 1-8001 wavefn=strcat('wavefn_',num2str(k)); %build filename dynamiclly wavwrite(wavefilesplit,Fs,16,strcat(filepathStr,wavefn,'.wav')); end Now for the last part. This works, but it's a bit of a mess. First of all -- no idea why you'd need two counter variables in the same `for` loop when `i` and `k` are going to both end up having the same values. So you could easily get away with just `i`. Second: On the first line of the loop (`wavefilesplit=...`), on each time through the loop, the first sample is going to be the same as the last sample of the previous chunk. This may not be critical for your present purposes, but it probably isn't technically what you want to be doing... i.e., if you re-joined all the chunks, it would not be identical to the original file (there would be one sample at each chunk boundary that repeated). I'll show a fix later. Third: Also minor, but there are better ways to build the filename than `strcat` and `num2str`. Specifically, `num2str` will represent the number 1 as "1", but when you're doing this kind of thing, often you want things to be numbered 001, 002, etc., so they look nice in a file list. Again, will fix later. Last: The final line is OK, but again I'd suggest using `fullfile` instead of `strcat` to build up your file path because it is more robust. In my next comment, I'll give you an example of how I'd rewrite the function to fix all of these things.
OK, and in case anyone is still listening out there... here is my suggestion for a better version of the file: function better_sound_chunker_reddit % I like to make all of my M-files functions even if they work like a simple % script. This is so they don't dump a bunch of variables into your workspace % when they're done running, which is a) messy/annoying and b) potentially % bug-causing down the line, if those variables don't get cleared and you run % the file again (or another file that uses the same variable names) and the % past values somehow affect the way the code in that script runs. In theory, % if your scripts are well-coded (i.e., the script makes sure to initialize % all the variables it uses), you should be OK, but sometimes you can get % really insidious bugs if you don't realize that a variable you think you % are using for the first time has already been defined. So better to avoid % the problem by putting everything in functions, which keep all their % variables to themselves and don't affect future scripts. fileStr='Test.wav'; filepathStr='/Users/matt/Documents/MATLAB/'; % Leaving these as-is for now, although note that we could make them inputs % to the function if we wanted, so you could run everything from the Command % Window without having to edit the M-file each time. chunk_size_s = 0.5; % Output chunk length, in seconds % This will let us make our output chunks whatever duration we want. Could % also change the function definition to make this an input argument if we % wanted to run the function from the command line and not edit the M-file. output_bits = 16; % Better to explicitly define your constants up at the top of your code % rather than bury them later on where they're hard to track down. This could % also become a function input if desired. Alternately, if you want to use % the same # of bits as the original input file, we could go back to saving % n_bits from wavread() on the next line, and use that when we call % wavwrite() at the end. [y, Fs] = wavread( fullfile(filepathStr, fileStr) ); % Uses fullfile() for more robust file path string construction % Alternate: [y, Fs, n_bits] = wavread( fullfile(filepathStr, fileStr) ); % (Use the alternate if you want your output bits to match your input... % see other alternate code at the end.) n_samples = size(y,1); % n_samples is a slightly more informative variable name than size_r. samples_per_chunk = round(Fs * chunk_size_s); % Puts a name to the # of samples in each audio chunk, which will make the % next line more readable than if we calculated this value inline. chunk_indices = 1:samples_per_chunk:n_samples; if chunk_indices(end) ~= n_samples chunk_indices = [chunk_indices n_samples]; end % This "if" statement fixes a minor/rare potential bug, which would happen % if the input file were *almost* perfectly divisible by the chunk length... % specifically, if it is 1 sample longer than a perfect chunking. E.g., if % your sampling rate is 44100, your chunk size is 0.5 seconds (22050 % samples), and your input file is 44101 samples long, running line 48 % without using the "if" statement to check this case would yield % chunk_indices == [1 22051 44101 44101]. But with the "if" statement, % it will be [1 22051 44101], which should be what we want later on. This % wasn't exactly an issue in the old function because it also had the issue % (fixed later on in this version) where a single sample would be repeated % across chunks... but if we fix that, we have to fix the chunk indices % here too. n_chunks = numel(chunk_indices) - 1; % The way we constructed chunk_indices above, we include both the first and % last samples in the list... so we will have 1 less chunk than the number % of items in the list. (This kind of thing can be surprisingly tricky and % my first version of this code had a common bug... see: % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error ) for i = 1:n_chunks start_ind = chunk_indices(i); end_ind = chunk_indices(i+1) - 1; % end_ind, the last sample in this chunk, should stop one sample before % the beginning of the next chunk. if i==n_chunks end_ind = end_ind+1; end % EXCEPT if we're on the last chunk -- in which case, we should include % that last little sample. chunk_samples = y( start_ind:end_ind, : ); out_filename = sprintf('wavefn_%.4d.wav', i); % Will produce wavefn_0001.wav, wavefun_0002.wav, etc... always % 4 digits (change the 4 to another # in that line for different % number of output digits). wavwrite( chunk_samples, Fs, output_bits, fullfile(filepathStr,out_filename) ); % Again, uses fullfile() for maximum compatibility/robustness. % Alternate: % wavwrite( chunk_samples, Fs, n_bits, fullfile(filepathStr,out_filename) ); % (If you used the other alternate line from above to save n_bits from % the input file and want to use the same # of bits in the output.) end Not guaranteed to be bug-free, as I knocked it out kind of quickly, but just tested it and it seems pretty solid. Certainly better style than the original, and hopefully a good tutorial in the comments? And it was a nice little exercise for me too, to think about the best way of doing this stuff...

Jesus what a piece of shit article, sinc function? Come on bro
Bleh, R is like gimped MATLAB in most ways, except working with huge data sets. I'm learning python ATM with the scipy/numpy/etc. packages. It's really enjoyable so far and not totally unfamiliar.
I remember someone around here saying that Matlab wasn't working on the 10.10 betas. Is this a fresh install of Matlab? Is an upgrade to a newer version possible? Does it launch from the terminal? &gt;cd $MATLAB_ROOT/bin &gt;./matlab -nodesktop I'm running R2014b fine from a 10.9 upgrade.
To answer the question though, the problem is rooted in the three uses of the plot command I think. It only recognises one set of data on it, so a legend with 3 labels will not match up. 
I assume you are correct :) However, the "problem" OP mentions is not an error code, but matlab "freezing up". And that part happens from running the plot commands an obscene number of times. OP's code is actually working, just so slowly that it they haven't noticed the legend error yet. 
A friend of mine said we can expect an update from matlab within a few weeks, and he found a work around. I'll see if he can send me the link. It's rather annoying if I remember correctly, but it'll due till a fix comes out. I'm personally just delaying updating. 
[Start here](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/159016-is-matlab-compatible-with-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite) The error that you posted is so generic though, that it could mean a large scope of issues are occurring. It sounds like you need to revert your OS or switch to a [compatible](http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/release2013a/index.html?sec=mac) OS to fix this. Based on the bug report, it's not likely anything older than R2013b will get patched. 
So I was able to download a patch (after endless tabs open) and I can't seem to find the patch now that I downloaded, but I have it running. I hope Mathworks does release an official update soon.
I had the same issue: [Here](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/159003-why-am-i-unable-to-install-or-start-matlab-on-os-x-10-10-yosemite) or [this](http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1116607)
First place: dbstop if error at the top of all of your scripts. This way if you have an error you can see where the problem is. Your variable 'init' in the if statement is undefined. You need to set this to some value for this to work. Let me know if it's still breaking (sorry, watching football, I'll check back on the next commercial).
OK, I just saw the init comment. I'm working on it. (Sorry, i really want Stanford to beat ASU).
I'm in the same situation. We're pretty much stuck for a while. They released a patch for r2013b and r2014a. But r2013a still doesn't work. I have an install file for 2014a, but I can't install it because the patch only works on already-installed versions. I'm still running r2014a on my Windows partition, though.
OK, so in the case that you want to multiply exp after adding RE### and NRE. Here is the code to generate the data to plot. Figure one plots a bunch of seemingly straight lines for your 3 variables. But your second figure has data in a 100 x 100 matrix for each of your 3 variables. How do you want to plot those? Here is updated code. clear; close all dbstop if error % Pricing quotes from Microchip website % PIC16F883: 2.19 &gt; 1000 % PIC16F1786: 1.92 &gt; 1000 % PIC16F1938: 1.95 &gt; 1000 code_cost = 135; LOC = 6000; units = 1e3:1e5:10e6; NRE = (code_cost * LOC) ./ units; uP_cost883 = 2.19; uP_cost1786 = 1.92; uP_cost1938 = 1.95; RE883 = units .* uP_cost883; RE1786 = units .* uP_cost1786; RE1938 = units .* uP_cost1938; %------------------- No Utilization ------------------- no_util_cost883 = RE883 + NRE; no_util_cost1786 = RE1786 + NRE; no_util_cost1938 = RE1938 + NRE; %------------------- No Utilization ------------------- %------------------- SLIDE 25 PLOT ------------------- % Folklore util_cost883=nan(100,100); util_cost1786=nan(100,100); util_cost1938=nan(100,100); for util = 1:100; if (0 &lt;= util &lt;= 75) &amp; (0 &lt;= util &lt;= 50) % if util &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; util &lt;= 50 folk(util) = 0.00167 * util + 1; exp(util) = 0.00167 * util + 1; elseif (0 &lt;= util &lt;= 75) &amp; (util &gt; 50) % elseif util &gt; 50 &amp;&amp; util &lt;=75 folk(util) = 0.00167 * util + 1; exp(util) = 0.0012 * (util).^2 - 0.130 * util + 4.5; elseif (util &gt; 75) &amp; (0 &lt;= util &lt;= 50) % elseif util &gt; 75 &amp;&amp; util folk(util) = 0.007 * util + 0.6; exp(util) = 0.00167 * util + 1; else folk(util) = 0.007 * util + 0.6; exp(util) = 0.0012 * (util).^2 - 0.130 * util + 4.5; end %------------------- Utilization ------------------- util_cost883(util,:) = (RE883 + NRE) * exp(util); util_cost1786(util,:) = (RE1786 + NRE) * exp(util); util_cost1938(util,:) = (RE1938 + NRE) * exp(util); %------------------- Utilization ------------------- end %------------------- SLIDE 25 PLOT ------------------- figure(1) plot(units, no_util_cost883, units, no_util_cost1786, units,... no_util_cost1938) xlabel('Number of Units Purchased') ylabel('Total Cost ($)') title('Total Cost vs. Number of Units - No Utilization') legend('PIC16F883', 'PIC16F1786', 'PIC16F1938', 'Location', 'Northwest') 
So your problem was that you were overwriting your exp and folk data with each for loop iteration. By indexing them you save them. I know this frustration and I hope this helps. 
Take a look at the sidebar. 
[They must not care that much anymore.](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search?src=Online/Job+Board/indeed&amp;utm_source=indeed&amp;utm_medium=jobaggr&amp;utm_campaign=freeaggr#t=sq&amp;q=j&amp;d=Matlab&amp;li=10&amp;j=Matlab&amp;) &gt; it just didn't meet the quality standards But somehow meets the standards of quality for airplanes, which is probably a bit more strict when it comes to bugs.
&gt; On Thursday night, Google's former svp/product management Jonathan Rosenberg was in London with chairman Eric Schmidt to promote their new book "How Google Works." &gt; And then Rosenberg said something really interesting. If you want to work at Google, make sure you can use MatLab, he said. https://www.google.com/about/careers/search?src=Online/Job+Board/indeed&amp;utm_source=indeed&amp;utm_medium=jobaggr&amp;utm_campaign=freeaggr#t=sq&amp;q=j&amp;d=Matlab&amp;li=10&amp;j=Matlab&amp; You do realize this was posted to /r/matlab. 
Does it matter where it's posted? MATLAB is still awful compared to pretty much everything else. Maybe you should post actual content instead of propaganda.
&gt; Maybe you should post actual content instead of propaganda. "Propaganda"? It came out of a Google exec's mouth in an interview. &gt; MATLAB is still awful compared to pretty much everything else. Not for what it is used for. Which is why people use it for what it is used for. &gt; Does it matter where it's posted? Because this subreddit is for Matlab and matlab discussion and such. It even says it in the side bar: "MATLAB code tricks, **discussion**, and questions; but we don't do your homework! Please do not ask us to help you pirate anything." If you hate Matlab that much why are you even subscribed? Shouldn't you go sit in /r/technology or /r/programming and rant about how terrible Matlab is?
Ayup. The bleh was at R in general, not its use by Google. It's the right tool for the job, it's just not my favorite tool.
It's happening again.
So if I don't agree with you, I should just go away? Good attempt at "discussion".
- You never appeared to want to have a discussion to begin with. If your first post was nothing but an incorrect statement and an unbacked opinion. - The first point is flat out wrong: Google does care what languages you know. Type "Matlab" into their career search page, you'll get a few hits. https://www.google.com/about/careers/ So the do care because they are actively looking for people that know it. - Your second is just opinion. You've put up no 'discussion' as to why Matlab is "the worst in almost every way" or "still awful compared to pretty much everything". Just that it is. - I never said "just go away". I asked why you were subscribed to /r/matlab (unless they made it a default) and hence commenting on stuff if you hated it so much. 
You post garbage, I post denial of such. You post opinions, I post opinions. Whee! Google does have some listings that contain the word "MATLAB". I bet they also have some listings that contain the word "janitor". I'm pretty sure that knowing how to janitor won't guarantee you a job at Google. Just like knowing how to deal with the crap that is MATLAB will not *guarantee* you a job at any respectable company -- unlike you claim with a poorly-written, unintelligible Business Insider article in which the author didn't even know what MATLAB was until 10 minutes before he wrote it. This is why I have the large suspicion that someone from MathWorks was writing a check to see this not-even-polished turd mention Google and MATLAB in the same sentence -- with a hugely click-baity title, no less. MATLAB is used almost exclusively in education, because degree-factories don't care about functionality. They can structure exercises around the quirks of terrible software, and since there is no way to optimize for results, there's no reason to care about effectiveness of the language you use. Whereas the "real world" outside academia needs to have some benefit to using this language over that one other than just curiosity. You are correct that you never said "just go away". But what you did say had a very definite angsty-teen-girl vibe of "if you don't like it, why are you even here?" -- which is a great deflection, but not much of an argument for your position.
First and foremost, you don't even bother to look up the rhetoric you keep rambling about. &gt; I bet they also have some listings that contain the word "janitor". They actually don't. None. Zip. https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#t=sq&amp;q=j&amp;d=janitor&amp;li=10&amp;j=janitor They do have 3 pages of Matlab results though. &gt; You post garbage, I've posted more quality content to this subreddit than it looks like you ever have. Unlike you I make my living with Matlab and like to know I have other options for job. It was an article from Slashdot that I thought belonged here since the subreddit has been rather full of homework questions. &gt; which is a great deflection, It wasn't a deflection, it was an honest question. If you hate Matlab as much as you do, why are you subscribed to /r/matlab. Do you intentionally set out to waste your time and others with stuff you don't like? You've deflected answering it multiple times. So once again. If you hate everything Matlab, why are you wasting your time (and ours) in this subreddit? &gt; with a hugely click-baity title, no less. The headline came straight from the story. If you clicked on it you would see that. &gt; someone from MathWorks was writing a check Writing a check to Google for mentioning it? &gt; in which the author didn't even know what MATLAB was until 10 minutes before he wrote it. Because most people don't. He took words from Google execs about Matlab. *That* was the content of the article that /r/Matlab should be interested in. Everyone here should already what Matlab is what everyone here might not know is that Google hires people proficient in Matlab. &gt; Google does have some listings that contain the word "MATLAB". I bet they also have some listings that contain the word "janitor". I'm pretty sure that knowing how to janitor won't guarantee you a job at Google. You seem to be mixing up the statements "If you know Matlab you will get a job at Google" and "If you want a job at Google you should know Matlab". &gt; MATLAB is used almost exclusively in education, Um, no, not really. It's another tool. A lot of people use Mathematica, MathCAD, Maple, etc. Each one is used for something different than Matlab just like you wouldn't use Maple If you were trying to imply that Matlab isn't used anywhere but education then that is flat out wrong. There are companies that have thousands of seats of Matlab for users. It's used heavily in automotive, aerospace, and other industries. There's a reason Mathworks is in business and it's not because they give away $100 licenses to students. &gt; and since there is no way to optimize for results, There are plenty of ways to optimize. You could even distill it down to C/C++ and compile that. There are plenty of ways to optimize Matlab, sorry your teacher didn't show you them. &gt; because degree-factories don't care about functionality Is that your bone to pick? Now it's the "degree factory's" fault. Are you an angsty MBA that didn't understand Matlab so it now immediately sucks? It's used heavily in industry and outside of academia. There may be a few languages that come close in functionality but nothing with the number of toolboxes available.
Yep. You got me. By cherry picking out-of-context words from my posts, you have proven to me that I know nothing. Have fun with that.
&gt; By cherry picking out-of-context words from my posts Oh, so cherry picking is now illegal? I was just following your lead. Once again, why are you in /r/matlab if you hate everything matlab? You're going for deflection #5 or 6 by now. Please show which statement was cherry picked to change the original intent. Every single one of those quotes conveyed exactly what you intended it to, you were just wrong. There are no janitor jobs: Wrong. Google doesn't care what language you know: Wrong, there are multiple job openings for Matlab. There aren't ways to optimize Matlab: Wrong again. 
There's a little docking button that you can use to switch between edit windows being docked to the Command Window, being separate but tabbed, and being separate but untabbed (different windows). IIRC if you get into different-window mode, you might have to dock all your windows to the Command Window first, then undock them in tabbed mode. Kind of stupid but you only have to do it once and then that stays the setting until you change it. On mobile so can't easily find examples/details, but search around a bit and I'm sure you can figure it out.
If you're on windows drag the command window to the far right and the script window to the far left for easy coding and debugging (each takes up exactly half of your screen). I can't stand it when the scripts are docked. Too little room to see what you're working on. 
Also, my code was y = (tan(theta_0)x) - (g./2((v_0).^2)(cos.^2(theta_0))(x^2 + y_0)
you need to put an * between terms you want multiplied.
I feel really dumb. Thank you so much.
Also watch out, your theta values will need to be in radians
I'm guessing you'll have to use a for-loop. There might be another way to do it, but that's how I'd approach this. It might be two nested for-loops (one to calculate the trajectory for each theta, the other to increment the theta value). Your code will probably be structured something like... % Initialize constants (like y0, v, and g) for (increment theta value) %Calculate trajectory for current theta value for (increment x-value) % Calculate the y-value at the current x-value and theta-value end end That's where I'd start
if you input f to the function as a string, then you'll be able to use the following: fPrime=inline(diff(sym(f))); dtrue=fPrime(x0); f=inline(f); in the place of: G=diff(f); G=@(x)G; dtrue=G(x0); This takes the derivative of the function inputed and then also sets it equal to f (which will allow the calculations later on.) If I remember calculus correctly, you'll also need to replace the 0.5 in the equation with x0.
Thanks! and can't wait for more of this walk-through teaching, really appreciated
A./B will perform an element-wise division.
Yup, that's the little bugger I was referring to!
1) you have the print statement inside the loop. while...end. Put the print statement after end. 2) It's the same as the first problem. Put the print statement after "end" 3) the code you have isn't in any way related to finding the max. max(Array1) 4) Why are you setting n=length(x) and then setting n=0 and then using n in your for loop? To solve your problem, it's the same as 1 and 2. Put the print statement after the loop. Put a semi-colon after x(n)+sum. 5) x=Array2; for i =length(x):-1:1 disp(x(i)) end I think you are pretty likely to fail this test tomorrow. Did you go to class at all?
Check where the fprintf needs to be in the first one. You should go through the matlab primer. It is a great help. Your problem stems more from programming methodology than matlab. Does your assignment say if you can use built in functions? 
It sounds like that's not a very good way to learn. Hopefully your professor will be able to realize the teaching methods aren't effective and you'll be able to get some extra time to figure out the basics. I'm not trying to shame you, but if you have a test tomorrow and don't understand how to even attempt some of the homework problems, something went wrong in the teaching/learning process somewhere.
I would read the setting started guide. All of this information is right in there -- quite early on I might add. 
Set the RGB values for pixels outside your circle to [0 0 0]. 
I didn't think anyone who did any serious machine learning stuff used Matlab. 
I find this a little surprising and am inclined to believe that the article is a little embellished. 
I ran your code, pulled the RGB value from near the peak, then used rgb2hsv () to convert to HSV. The first value in the output of that was close to 0.14. Change that value and the color of the peak will change. 
Great, thanks.
Please provide a a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) so we can actually help you and not guess at what the problem is.

Happy MATLAB-ing everyone. I installed this patch and it works like a charm: [patch](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l9d5qzzgzyjjn46/AACFQ4AC4wR9Mtl5NgvcAiaKa?dl=0)
Thanks!
Why is the XYZ file not adequate? How close are those points sampled? You could always use MATLAB to interpolate curves if you need finer precision.
Why not use [max()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/max.html)?
Are you using the standard physics equations of motion? If that's the case, then your acceleration wouldn't be zero at time zero because your initial forces are nonzero. If you want acceleration to taper in over time you need the force to increase from zero as well.
 clc; clear all; close all; load lab7.mat; x = Array1; n=length(x); maxy=x(1); for ii=2:1:n y = x(ii); if y&gt;maxy; maxy=y; end end disp(maxy) This works by saving the current value as maxy if it's larger than the current maximum value.
I did not know about the tilda/squiggly thing. Awesome! That's the only problem with basically self-teaching matlab. There are so many little things that can just pass you by if you don't specifically run into them.
Well, you are not only using memory for your main program but also for several other programs and subroutines such as the global optimization routines. If you use windows you can also use the task manager to see how much memory matlab really needs to solve the problem. Some other tips: 1. did you test the algorithm with a smaller test problem? Do you run into the same problems? If no, then your problem might be simply too big for your computer to handle or you might want to check your source code and see how you can save memory. 2. Did you preallocate the memory for all variables? If no, are there any vectors or matrices that grow with every iteration? This could be the source of the problem. 3. Before you start your program clean up matlabs working space. Tbh, it is very difficult to make anything more than a general statement if we don't see any source code or don't even know the size of the problem.
Except most questions aren't flat out homework questions. Some are good or directed.
Thanks for your answer. I am using linux, but I of course can use top and htop to do the same thing as task manager. As the program runs it slowly eats up more and more memory, eventually dying after several hours. I can see the memory the program is using slowly grow in real time. 1. This is a large project (simulation) with thousands of lines of code -- I haven't tried to scale the problem down, but I might do that if I can't figure out which part of the program is the problem without doing so. I really don't want to do that, but I will if it is necessary. 2. Everything is preallocated, thanks for the suggestion. 3. I use clearvars -except blah as much as I can as the program is running. This hasn't solved the problem. I understand -- obviously I don't expect you to go through thousands of lines of code. I am just looking for general advice about locating a memory leak. Thanks again!
Don't be so defensive -- *of course* I'm not going to believe something I say I'm not inclined to believe. If you have something interesting with which to supplement the article then go ahead. Defending it the way you're doing in this thread makes you seem overly emotional. 
No problem. Glad it helped mate.

Just upgraded today, got it to work fairly easily. Needed to install the patch mentioned here: http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/2i6uxa/matlab_users_with_yosemite/ Then had to change the version number in the Info.plist from 8.3.0 to 9.3.0 and it started without a fuss.
You've got to do better than that. "The one app you need on your resume if you want a job at google: Matlab" was the title of your post. That couldn't be more absurd. 
Maybe. 
Maybe? Is there a posting guideline I'm missing here? I've tried a bit of google searching and didn't seem to find an answer. 
Read your own question. If someone asked you that question, do you think you'd be able to give a detailed response? You basically asked "I've got code that does things. Is there a better way to do things?" The only answer to that is "maybe", unless you explain what you're doing and how you're doing it, and probably give an example. 
Great. Thanks
I'm asking in a very generic sense implying a heavy usage of if-then or if-else-elseif in a very large iterative format. Meaning if-then statements are used at least 20-30 times per iterations (10^3-10^6) than they are going to happen a lot. Everything I've seen online suggest matlab doesn't provide a strong computational improvement for using cases vs. if-then statements. They are comparing index numbers and depending on the index number they are doing that specific mathematical operation. Do you want me to post a 1000 line code here?
Same. Upgraded a friend's: change the "BundleVersion" string from 8.3.0 to 9.3.0. Also had some trouble with the doc command after patch and first launch, namely freezing (mid-2012 MBP). Ran a command to switch back to HTML rendering (presumably WebKit calls are borked). EDIT: Command was com.mathworks.mlwidgets.html.HtmlComponentFactory.setDefaultType('HTMLRENDERER'); 
Thanks, knew I was missing a piece of understanding.
So without knowing more, what I would do is try to use logical indexing. MatLab does very well with indexing operations, you could pull all and only the elements of a matrix or grid that pass a particular test with very few lines of code and almost no explicit iteration. Here's the Mathworks page about it: http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2008/01/28/logical-indexing/
Vectoriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeze it
Persistent variables should be conditionally initialised. Also, they are automatically initialised to zero/empty (I forget). Check the documentation. Do this instead if isempty(num_iter) Num_iter = 0; end
The bottom of that solution says: If, after completing all of the previous steps, you are still encountering this issue, please contact the Installation &amp; Licensing team by creating a request here: http://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us/index.html Did you try this?
This is the right answer. OP, your code sets num_iter = 0 every time. Don't do that.
What are you doing with it? What are your if-then-else statements? If you're checking to see if each element is less than 7, then of course you can simplify this greatly. If, instead, you are computing some iterative or neighborhood-based calculation for each element in 64x64x64, then the answer might be yes, might be no, might be "depends."
This is why companies have technical support. If you can't figure it out, just contact them! For all you know many people might be having this issue and it's something they have to look into. 
Well, without looking at your actual code take a good look at what the error actually says: "The function values at the interval endpoints must differ in sign." So you have your function "c" and your interval points (-1000 and 1000). Have you checked the value of that function on those points? So c(1000) and c(-1000). Matlab wants those two values to differ in sign (so 1 positive and 1 negative). Are they different in signs? 
Some useful commands that you can look up on help: * pzmap * pzplot * tf * ss * ss2tf * tf2ss * bode * rlocus * zpk * ssdata * tfdata You're probably looking for the second one, but I am a controls engineer and use all of those daily and find them all helpful.
OP probably used different parameters "a few days ago", because both c(-1000) and c(1000) are negative.
Sorry about that, I just kind of blindly copied and pasted.
Your first line returns the zeros, poles and gain. If you want to split this into three parts, you can use these to get the three transfer functions you want using zpk(). If u print the poles, you'll see that the first two are conjugate, 3 and 4 too, and the last is the real pole. So in your case you can do for example this to plot them: bode(zpk([],p(1:2),k^(1/3))) hold on; bode(zpk([],p(3:4),k^(1/3))) bode(zpk([],p(5),k^(1/3))) legend('First','Second','Third') I just split the gain over the three filters, dont know if thats what you want. Also, bode plots the magnitude and phase automatically, you can indicate the frequencies you want to plot too (see help bode). Or if you want to plot only the magnitude, you can use bodemag. Also I think bode uses rad/s (frequency) and radians (phase) as default units. You can change them by typing ctrlpref. Also the whole filter can be plotted by bode(zpk(z,p,k)) EDIT: I just saw that you change the cutoff frequency with the lp2lp line and therefore also the poles. So run this to get the correct poles before the above: [z,p,k] =zpkdata(tf(numt,dent),'v') Also, check if the poles are in the same order as before by printing them. Type help or doc functionname to understand what each function does. 
That is exactly what I was looking for, thank you so much. I am just learning matlab, unfortunately I haven't had as much time as I would like to learn it.
I had to install a patch but I got R2013a working. It was pretty simple.
Super off topic, sorry! But what's being a control engineer like? I've been super interested in that career path? Is it lots of computer work like on MATLAB and stuff?
Send me a pm.
Or you can use tand(θ) and leave θ in degrees. Adding 'd' after your trig function tells matlab to interpret number as a degree instead of a radian.
It seems a little sensationalized. Just think about the title for one second and you realize how ridiculous it is. 
Is MATLAB an "App" now?
I suggest that you take the time to read/work your way through one or more tutorials linked in the sidebar. If, after that, you still have specific questions, please post them here and we'd be happy to help you work through them.
Maybe someone responded by PM to you, but I bet no one has, and that's because we'd rather see: 1. an explicit problem you are having 2. the way(s) you've attempted the problem yourself before giving help.
Yes this made me die laughing and I spent a lot of time talking my gf about this. I said back in the day everything was "programs." Except for boring programs which were called "applications." yaknow, like Word, Excel, etc (*). Exceptionally boring programs like application-specific software such as Microsoft Quicken were called "productivity applications." Then, Java came out and web pages would run "applets." Then smart phones came out and they had "apps." Then by mysterious forces, absolutely all five of those got munged together under the rubric "apps," with the effect that the name is faster to say and means less, which is exactly the zeitgeist. (*) Now i'm older and I respect "application programs," but back then, I couldn't think of anything ickier than balancing a checkbook.
Someone else posted a link a while back where an employee from google said the complete opposite. If they just listed Matlab for programming, they'd take it with a grain of salt and believe the individual may or may not know how to program correctly and efficiently. If someone listed other languages like Java, python, or C, they took them more seriously
You have an error in the code where you assign x and y.The numbers don't agree with the values for the points you wrote above. To do this in Matlab, you need to plot these functions over a larger range. One way to do this is to use anonymous functions. b1= [p3 + p4 + 2, p3 + p4] b2= [ p3 + p4 - 2, p3 + p4 + 1 ] A = @(x) abs(p1*x + p2) - (p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + p9 + p10); B = @(x) (b1(1)-b2(1))/(b1(2)-b2(2))*(x-b1(1))+b1(2) figure hold on plot(-100:100,A(-100:100)) plot(-100:100,B(-100:100)) I found the formula for the function B using the method here: http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html In order to use the "solve" function, it looks like you need to be using symbolic equations. syms xx yy BB=(b1(1)-b2(1))/(b1(2)-b2(2))*(xx-b1(1))+b1(2) AA= abs(p1*xx + p2) - (p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + p9 + p10); solve(AA==BB) You can also skip the above anonymous functions and use "ezplot" to plot the symbolic functions directly. figure; hold on ezplot(AA) ezplot(BB)
First of all thank you for answering my question I really appriciate that, its very kind of you! When I wrote this I was at school using their computer which already has Matlab installed. Unfortunately Im currently home and wont be able to work with this problem until tomorrow morning. Im wondering if these codes that you wrote down is the solution to the problem I wrote down? Becuase if it is Im gonna take a closer look at it tomorrow and try and understand it, Im not interested in just knowing the answer. Also thanks for providing the link of where you found the formula I will definately read through it!
Also could you briefly explain a bit of what your code means? What does @(x) mean or the plot (-100...) im also wondering if I could Pm you my skype so i might be able to contact you tomorrow if i get really stuck somewhere? would help alot, thank you ) :)
You should read the help files for the Matlab functions. This will give you the syntax and examples for how to use them. Start with these: http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/syms.html http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/ezplot.html http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html 
The pdetool is probably a good start. There's a nice demo showing nonlinear heat transfer (with radiation) here: http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/pde/ug/nonlinear-heat-transfer-in-a-thin-plate.html 
Well, if you divide by (x-2) you have to assume that x=2 is not in the domain, so I guess Matlab is right...
It's Business Insider, they've always struck me as being about half a step above click bait.
So simple, yet so effective. It worked fine after this and I managed to complete the assignment. Thanks very much for all your help!
Completely right, I wasnt told about the dot business. Starting to get my head round Matlab but they really dont want to give us much help for some reason. People like you make a massive difference, and I appreciate the (very!) detailed response. I meant to say thanks earlier but completely forgot, hope you have a great evening and thanks you very much! 
Makes perfect sense, though I had never heard that before. Your help was awesome and makes a big difference. Its finally starting to make sense but judging by my Matlab ability I will be back for more help soon! Have a great one!
I keep saying "Appecutables" but it doesn't seem to catch on.
I remember this, but there was no real source. It was an image of some text posted on imgur saying that the person's professor's friend who was an ex hiring manager at google said XYZ. 
Every damn time a student asks a question someone downvotes. Why!? This is a legitimate question.
You could use disp('text here') to display some text you want on the command line for the user to read and selection1 = input('input number corresponding to X selection') and you could make a hirearchy of selection processes (a tree). For help on those commands, you can type "help + &lt;command&gt;" at either the MATLAB command line or Google and you'll get helpful documentation on the uses of either input() or disp().
Could you be a little more specific about what you're trying to do? You could probably use if statements or use the dirac/heaviside functions if I'm understanding your question correctly.
If you look at your variable a in the workspace, you'll probably see that it has dimensions of n x m x 3 i.e., your image is in RGB. When you plot it, it's plotting all three z-direction (R, G, and B) vectors one after one another, making a plot three times as long as you expect. If you convert it to greyscale using [rgb2gray](http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/rgb2gray.html) you'll get a n-by-m matrix of values which correspond to intensity, which you can then use to plot. Incidentally, plot(A(1890,:)); is plotting a row (row #1890), not a column, which you mentioned in the post title.
I don't think there is a builtin function but you can do something like this: d=find(diff(x)); y=[d(1),diff(d),length(x)-d(end)]; diff returns the difference between consecutive values in the vector x. find returns the indices of the nonzero values of diff(x) which correspond to indices in the x array where the value changes.
I've done this in the past. If memory serves me correctly, I used bwlabel. Anyway, the image processing toolbox had some good told to extract contiguous regions from binary images. They work on 1d data just as well
You have a few equations with a single free parameter (theta), and you say you can get a single result, I'm assuming from solving for a single theta.... So I'm going to give you some steps, but not write the code... It should get you started. 1. Create vectors representing each range of theta. 2. Solve each vector for y, using the appropriate equation. Solving multiple value at a time works the same as a single value as long as you use a . before the operator to indicate it's not a matrix operation (e.g. a.* b means multiply element-wise) 3. Concatenate the vectors in order, or plot each individually using hold all
**tl:dr: [Vectorize the code](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html), [use logical indexing](http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2008/01/28/logical-indexing/), [use mod function to generalize](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mod.html)** 1) Use [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to share code. People can then modify it, commit it, etc. It's the best way to share code on the web. Taking a screenshot of code is about on par with the people that use Excel to send pictures. (Yes, I've seen it done). 2) Don't use if statements. That means you'll have to do a loop somewhere. Matlab hates loops. I hate loops. [Vectorize the code](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html). If you learn to use [logical indexing](http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2008/01/28/logical-indexing/) you can skip past all the if stuff. 3) Your professor screwed up the equations. They're all &lt;= where one side should be &lt;= and the other &lt;. Even if the numbers are the same at that point it's poor form to callout piecewise functions with overlap. I'm not a mathematician but I can't imagine that it's "valid" function or some such thing. 4) Your professor also only called out 0-2\*pi. I would use the [mod function](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mod.html) to generalize it for all thetas.

If you find the MATLAB_R2014a.app file in your applications folder, right click "Show Package Contents", in the finder window that opens up go to "Contents" &gt; "Info.plist" and double click to open that up. Find the "Bundle Version" string and change the value from 8.3.0 to 9.3.0, save that then try running Matlab again and it should start up.
My solution is that if y == NaN for the given point I divided, which is x=2 in this case, just add an infinitesimal number to x, so you are good to go.
thank you that fixed everything !!
The x-values are all you need. Save them e.g. using x_sol = solve(AA==BB) and input it into you function A or B to get the y-values
You know the x-values of where the two functions A and B cross. Lets say these values are x_1 = 5 and x_2 = 6. You know that A(5) = B(5) and A(6) = B(6) since they solve your problem. The y-values, y_1 and y_2 would be y_1 = A(x_1) and y_2 = A(x_2) (or B(x_1) and B(x_2) since they are the same if x_1 and x_2 solve your system). So by inputing them into your function A or B, i mean actually calculate A(6) and A(5) which is as simple as typing A(5) into Matlab as A is defined as an anonymous function. Be careful - 5 and 6 are hypothetical values. You need to use the values given by solve(AA==BB) 
I tried it out myself and it should work for sure (if you type it in correctly but that shouldn't be a problem). Since I am from Germany, contacting might be a problem because of sleep. I will be online the next few hours though. Just in case: Solution (add this at the bottom of your code). You should try to get it yourself though as it is beginner/basic Matlab stuff. EDIT: Since I dont know how to spoiler something, here you go x_sol = solve(AA==BB) y_sol = A(x_sol) %Plotting plot(x_sol, y_sol, 'ro') 
well they do have an app for smartphones that you can type in commands and it will send off to a server to be exicuted
Have you taken a look through the links on the sidebar? They are some good resources, tutorials, and references.
I'm assuming you think/have prior knowledge that the function is a polynomial? Also, how many times are you wanting to find the order (ie. how many polynomials/loops)? Instead of calling your anon function for just one value, call it for many (ie. x = 0:0.01:100) and get a vector of outputs. You can then make use of polyfit() and polyval() to fit an N-order polynomial to your data. Finally, check how large of error is acceptable before claiming that you've found the best polynomial. You should restrict your polynomial searching to a small number of orders, otherwise you're best fit will be an N-order polynomial where N is also the number of points you have making the polynomial. If I'm completely off base with what you're trying to do, let me know.
log(p(x))/log(x) approaches n, if n is the order of p, when x approaches infinity. 
Thanks! That looks really interesting. 
Woah. How did I not know this. Edit: on further reflection it makes perfect sense, but it's still cool.
Ok, I think you are actually close to a solution here. I didn't verify your code, but you say that your code works fine for finding y for each given x. Excellent! 1. Make that a function 2. Call that function for all the values of X and store in a vector 3. Plot Copy your code into a new .m file and save it as cam.m Make sure to remove the part where you ask the user for input function cam(x) pi=180; if x&gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x&lt;pi/2 ... end From the workspace you should be able to call: cam(50) and have it give you the appropriate y value. Then do this: x=1:360; y=arrayfun(@cam,x); plot(x,y) arrayfun applies the function to each value in the array x.
That seems rather arbitrary. The limit of (x^(2)+x-6)/(x-2) for x going to 2 is not 0, but 5 (by L'Hôpital's rule). Edit: l2reddit Edit 2: Sorry, I have no idea why I thought you said you assigned the value 0 instead of NaN :)
Whoops thanks that's probably a good place to start
Seems to me like you may be specifying the dimensions wrong in the squeeze function. They should probably be in the format (frame_no,:,:) &lt;- As you'll need to select all elements for each frame (rather than just the element at row 10, column 10.) 
Try uitable?
What are you trying to create a table of? Tables are just a container class like structs and cell arrays. Creating a table can be as simple as: myTable = table(Tp1) See the documentation for a couple of examples: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html
Please edit your code with 4 spaces before lines that you want displayed as code. We'll appreciate it as it's easier to read.
There usually aren't student versions for the R20xxb releases. If you want a student version you'll have to buy R2014a or wait for R2015a.
[I'm not the OP, but I reformatting this for easier reading ("..." are added by me for readability). Everything below is OP's]: I made matlab code to find the natural cubic spline.

Ah that's a disappointment! I guess i'll just use a crack for now.. Thanks for the help
I don't really remember it either. I just realized it on the spot, thinking there should be an easier method than yours. 
Yup - fully admit what I put forth is more brute than elegant :)
Thank you for doing this, I'm new to this, so learning the rules is cool. do you have any advice on how to help solve the problem.
PS there is no comment where you asked if there is supposed to be a comment
Sometimes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave is better than matlab. For instance the full version is free.
Good to know that solved it! With regards to displaying data: You could take a look at fprintf to display it nicely (the Matlab documentation should be able to help you with that, let us know if you get stuck).
OK, if you'll *promise* this isn't homework -- I'll give you my solution. Not saying this is the best way or anything, but it's the way that came to mind for me -- and it uses more Matlab built-in matrix functions without a single loop, which is generally more "Matlabbic" (my version of "Pythonic"). function segMatrix = segmentMatrix2(imSize) half = imSize/2; segMatrix = ones(imSize); top_right = triu(segMatrix); bottom_left = ~triu(segMatrix); top_left = fliplr(top_right); bottom_right = fliplr(bottom_left); [xs,ys] = meshgrid(1:imSize,1:imSize); left_half = xs&lt;=half; right_half = xs&gt;half; top_half = ys&lt;=half; bottom_half = ys&gt;half; segMatrix(top_left &amp; right_half) = 2; segMatrix(bottom_right &amp; top_half) = 3; segMatrix(top_right &amp; bottom_half) = 4; segMatrix(bottom_left &amp; right_half) = 5; segMatrix(bottom_right &amp; left_half) = 6; segMatrix(top_left &amp; bottom_half) = 7; segMatrix(bottom_left &amp; top_half) = 8; Note that this gives a very slightly different result from yours -- basically you have to make some arbitrary judgment calls about how to treat the values on the diagonals, since they don't fall cleanly into one section. So my default solution makes one set of judgment calls, yours makes another. Easy enough to tweak the code if you have any particular scheme in mind for resolving that ambiguity.
how did you make the code come out organized like that?
Alright man I'll just pm you here works great anyways :) I just tried what you gave me. before that I noticed that its a plot function? I ran the program and on the console still only got the x values, but on the figure there was now red rings on the intersections. I think Im suppose to also solve the y values or whatever its called, like this is my console after running the program - ans = 3 -49/5 And I checked and they are the x values of the intersection. but how can I also get the y values solved on the console. Thank you buddy 
Did you use x_sol = solve(AA==BB) y_sol = A(x_sol) %Plotting plot(x_sol, y_sol, 'ro') The console output is somewhat irrelevant. Read through those 3 lines. It first solves the system for the x-values and saves them in the variable **x_sol**. Then it uses the function A( ) to get the y-values and saves them into the vector **y_sol**. Your console output should read something like x_sol = 3 -49/5 y_sol = 26 386/5 In general, you want to avoid getting console outputs by removing the semicolon ; at the end of statements. Save them into variables and check those variables after the program finishes if possible. Right now, your console output has all the points etc. in it since you never use semicolons. EDIT: Also, try to figure out what actually happens as understanding is better than copying code. I plotted the solution at the end since it is a easy way to visually verify if you calculated the right points. Another way would be to check if A(x_sol) is equal B(x_sol) (this is also true here) 
`cell2mat()` requires all the items in your cells to have compatible dimensions -- and your strings are probably not the same length, so it won't work. The function you're probably looking for here is `char()`
So I think it is probably that the length of each string is not the same. The only slight work around would be to find the minimum length of all the names you have, (we'll call it minlen) and then put the first minlen letters of each name into an array. minlen = min(cellfun(@(x) length(x), cell_array)); name_array = cellfun(@(x) x(1:minlen, cell_array); 
Thank you for answering! I like learning from questions and answers here and I found your solution informative. 
Thank you again. Actually I added semicolons. Almost everywhere. Thats why I never got the y_sol = 26 386/5 because I had it on semicolon :D sorry about that still learning. Yes ofc I will look through everything and learn it, but this was more of a FAST thing I had to do since I have to hand it in today, and also I need to go home today where I dont have acces to matlab etc. Thank you so much for your assistance. Im gonna hand it in and hope it goes well &lt;3. In case you were wondering at all Im studying , its called like "Degree of Master of Science in Engineering: Game and Software Engineering" So I kinda need to learn programming. Gonna take C class soon and then c++ etc. Are you studying something similar or whats the reason you got into Matlab? 
I studied Mathematics in Science and Engineering (Basically Mathematics with a few applied lectures in Engineering/Informatics/whatever you choose) and will start working soon. We had to use Matlab for quite a few projects. If you want to go through some programming tutorials, I can recommend [these](https://buckysroom.org/videos.php) for learning the basics in C++/C/whatever.

I was trying to create a table using the table function but for some reason it wasn't working. I ended up setting a "table" using fprintf. Came out nice if I may say so. Thanks again.
Thanks everyone for your advice and recommendations. I was able to create a decent table just using fprintf. My professor just wanted something that looked organized. Thanks again!
According to the Matlab documentation *Creating strings in a regular MATLAB® array requires that all strings in the array be of the same length. This often means that you have to pad blanks at the end of strings to equalize their length. However, another type of MATLAB array, the cell array, can hold different sizes and types of data in an array without padding. Cell arrays provide a more flexible way to store strings of varying length.*
What are you trying to do that necessitates converting a cell array to an array? There may be a different way to accomplish the goal without conversion. 
First of all, what are you trying to do? If you have strings, a cell array is the best place to keep them. Nearly nothing good can come of creating a big 2D array of characters. If you really want to do that, check out the function strvcat(). A = {'Reddit'; 'Digg'; 'Fark'} B = strvcat(A) BUT If the cell array is a cell array of strings which are actually numbers (like '42'), then you probably *do* want to convert them to a more usable format. In that case, str2double should work directly: A = {'12';'34';'45'} B = str2double(A) 
If you can, it's better to preallocate--even if you allocate too much or too little and need to change the size--than to expand a single element or column at a time. For small arrays, it's not a big deal, but for large arrays Matlab's run-time allocation costs become significant (each time you add an element, Matlab may have to re-allocate the entire array; for large arrays, this adds significant processing time and contributes to memory fragmentation).
I would use heaviside if you trying to do what I think you're doing. For example, this will get you something like the moment curve for a beam supported at both ends with an applied F in the middle: F=1; x=0:.01:1; y= F/2\*x - F\*heaviside(x-.5).\* (x-.5)+F/2 \*heaviside(x-1).*(x-1); figure;plot(x,y)
So matplotlib does the job. https://pdf.yt/d/u-zDyYL7wBvhdzGd Here is the python script: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, x) zdata = (3*(1-X)**2.*np.exp(-(X**2) - (Y+1)**2) - 10*(X/5 - X**3 - Y**5)*np.exp(-X**2-Y**2) - 1/3*np.exp(-(X+1)**2 - Y**2)) levels = np.linspace(-9, 9, 32) fig = plt.figure(1) cplot = plt.contourf(X, Y, zdata, levels=levels) fig.colorbar(cplot, format="%1.2f") plt.show() 
It literally tells you the error. &gt; index must be a positive integer or logical. ~~```matrix = repmat(```**0**```, size_of_matrix);```~~ And never, ever go a2m. 
~~index must be a positive integer.~~ ~~0 is not a positive integer.~~ Edit: I forgot repmat functionality 
But why does it work perfectly with the dataset S? From what I understand, this repmat just fills a matrix with 0s. There is another error and I think this is the key here...
Scratch that. I forgot that it repmat the first argument is the replicated array. It means ```[trace_number_of_samples total_number_of_traces]``` One of those 2 numbers is 0. Also ```zeros``` is a bit easier than a ```repmat```. ```matrix=zeros(trace_number_of_samples,total_number_of_traces);``` Put a debug stop to see which of the values is 0.
Like /u/DStoo said, use zeros instead of repmat. The error is because trace_number_of_samples=sampling_frequency*1000*trace_length; Does not return an integer but a double. So use round() to get an integer: trace_number_of_samples = round(sampling_frequency*1000*trace_length); 
You use size_of_matrix=[trace_number_of_samples total_number_of_traces]; Both values in there have to be integers because you eventually use them as number of rows and columns to build a matrix. You only used round on the second value (total_number_of_traces). The reason why the S does work is that the calculation of trace_number_of_samples for the corresponding values results in an integer. It just depends on the numbers. 
Guess I just have to accept that. Depending on the numbers, we end up with different formats.. 1400 is stored as a double, 17500 is stored as an integer.
Its not that 1400 is stored as double, but the fact that the calculation does not exactly result in 1400. I'm not an expert but it has to do with floating point arithmetic if you want to look into that. 
This is exactly what bugs me, both values are calculated by: sampling_frequency * 1000 * trace_length Dataset R: 20 * 1000 * 0.07 = exactly 1400 Dataset S: S 250 * 1000 * 0.07 = 17500
No, 20 * 1000 * 0.07 is not exactly 1400 for the computer/matlab. Like I said it has to do with floating point precision. You can see that by doing: 20 * 1000 * 0.07-1400 The result is 2.273736754432321e-13 and not 0. 250 * 1000 * 0.07-17500 is 0. Like I said I'm not an expert, maybe someone else can explain it better or you can google yourself. 
O_o Ok thanks.
Look into using the find() function. Logical indexing works as well. You should likely include some threshold as well (ie. delta &lt; 0.0001) Also, 4 spaces starting lines will make your code look all nice x.*3.*y as opposed to x.*3.*y
y(y &lt; 0) = 0
Thanks for the formatting tip.
Thank you. 
Something like that. Try it, fix it. I don't have matlab at home so I can't check it. x = [ -1, -0.8; -0.8, -0.6; -0.4, -0.2; -0.1, 0.1; 0.2, 0.4; 0.6, 0.8; 0.8, 1]; root = zeros(7, 1) for i = 1:7 root(i) = fzero(@myfunc, x(i, :)) end
pretty much dead on man. thanks a lot!
You could just use your OS command line with bang. &gt; ! cat myfile.wav Or whatever the Windows equivalent is.
No I must insist in having a pling, not a plong.
Sounds like a line out of a Dr. Seuss book ...
One thought- stick a bunch of zeros at the start of your array y, so that if the first part of the sound is truncated, all that is missing is some silence
It sounds like /u/omegagoose might have the best answer. In case not... I can't remember the command but there's one that will automatically scale your wav file to remove clipping etc. I never used it as the amount of gain it applied (positive or negative) varied for different files and I needed consistency, but it might help your situation.
Save as .dmx
Do you really have that % character in there? bodeplotoptions.XLabel= ('Frequenz [Hz]','FontSize',14,'FontName','Arial'%); The error might be related to not having a closed ) for this line (as % comments out the remainder of that line, the ");" characters). Try removing the % and see what happens?
Axis 
Oups, thank you!
A photo would go a long way in explaining your problem.
On mobile but what about this: X = strcat('%.',n,'f') Sprintf(X,a)
No prob! I always forget a step ok mobile. 
round2 already exists. http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4261-round2
What is displayed in the console when you try to open the file? 
Thanks! Would you by any chance know how I can calculate the error first coefficient (the gradient)? 
I'm not sure what you mean with 'error first coefficient (the gradient)'. If you want the gradient of the fit, it's the first value of coeff (coeff(1)). Also the line bestfit= polyval(coeff,y); should be bestfit= polyval(coeff,x); since polyfit calculates the coefficients for the function y(x) = a*x+b (since you have order 1) and polyval evaluates that function for the given x values. Type 'help polyfit' in the command window for more info.
Wow why are people suggesting using string operations for this! This is going to be very slow and clunky converting back and forth between numbers and strings. The round() function removes all decimal places, and multiplication/division by powers of 10 moves the decimal place. If you want to round to the first decimal place, you multiply by 10, round normally, then divide by 10. For the second decimal place, you use 10^2 etc
Sorry bad wording. I was asking if you knew how I could find the error in the gradient. i.e. gradient = m +/- m_error Also I noticed the error in my polyval() and have fixed it but thanks for pointing it out :)
Haha. Oh man. We've all been there! Not insulting you, but always read error messages carefully. MATLAB does a good job of pointing out errors.
It gave my physics pals a good laugh when I told them of my shame 
I guess you can estimate the gradient error by taking the extreme values of the first and last value of y (y(1)-y_error(1) and y(end)+y_error(end) ) and use these values to calculate the corresponding gradient and then subtract it from the bestfit gradient to get the gradient error. 
That means that the provided x (input of your function) consists of only one element (numel = number of elements), while it should be an array of six elements.
I see. So should I be providing an x input of something like x = [1 2 3 4 5 6]?
yes
Still gives me the same error unfortunately...
you sure it's the same error? because you have some undefined constants (a and y) which should also give you errors.
Floor and ceil can round up or down for you. To get them to round at decimal place n, multiply your number by 10^n, floor or ceil, and divide by 10^n 
I'm sorry that you're having trouble with your homework, but you really haven't reached a point where this forum can help you. It sounds like the issue is understanding what quantization, modulation, and encoding are and how they work. If you are having trouble understanding that I suggest reading your book, reading some online resource, and going to office hours. Once you understand the mathematics behind these concepts they should be fairly straight forward to implement, but if you have specific questions about the implementation, or how MATLAB specific concepts such as vectorization or logical indexing can be incorporated, I'd be happy to help. 
You seem to be confused not so much about the matlab, but more so about the stats (e.g., what do you think mean(pdfy) is returning?) Perhaps you should check out /r/statistics. Regarding drawing random values from an arbitrary distribution, check out inverse transform sampling. 
If you use the fft function as suggested by above by /u/rlrl it will plot the power spectrum of your audio signal. This shows the relative intensity of each frequency (i.e. tone in your case) in the signal. You can filter(.e. remove) tones/frequencies from your signal using the filtfilt command, but you will need to understand how a notch filter (also mentioned by /u/rlrl) works in order to implement it properly. 
The file opened just fine with any text editor. Even with Matlab's text editor, if I opened it through the "Open file" button. I don't know what happened, but I've just gave it a try and it appears that at this moment Matlab opens it just fine. Weird.
Not 100% sure what you're trying to do. With `sin`, it is periodic so you can sample from 0 to 2pi and be fine. But are you trying to get the PDF of Z =(2X-1)^2 with a sample from a certain range? (say, -1 to 1)? Anyway, if you have a set of values from which to build the PDF, you essentially just sampled it already and no need to sample an arbitrary PDF. But, if I am mistaken and you do want to sample an arbitrary PDF, you can use inverse CDF sampling as others mentioned or implement a Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
Just use m = char(c);
Hey sorry I havent responded in a while. Ive been away. Ive actually watched a bunch of videos already with bucky, really easy to understand him. Many people suggest reading books, How effective is reading books compared to watching buckys video? And on the matlab task, unfortunately I didint pass it. He told me what was wrong, something like My B line doesnt pass where its suppose to and the A figure doesnt look like its suppose to.
&gt;MATLAB code tricks, discussion, and questions; but we don't do your homework!
I suggest you read about IF statements. You are going to need a single IF, followed by two ELSEIF and a final ELSE. These correspond to the different cases you mentioned (1 through 4). Also, when one of those cases involve two conditions (like divisible by 4 but not 100), you will need to add an AND or an OR. I hope this helps.
Vectorizing. Imagine you have the following: x=rand(1,1e6); That's a list of 1 million numbers. You want to find all of the values that are less than 0.5; how do you do this? bottom_half=x&lt;0.5; There, we did it in one step. If you want to access these values (bottom_half is now a "logical array", indicating a 1 where x &lt; 0.5 and a 0 where it's not), you'd do the following: y = x(bottom_half);
This sounds like you copied it directly from your homework but only reworded the first sentence and tacked on the last two. edit: I'll do this for you for $100 in any crypto currency you'd like to pay in. 
This is the answer. 
&gt; I'll do this for you for $100 in any crypto currency you'd like to pay in. We discourage this here.
Is the SDK installed? http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2010b/win64.html &gt;Both Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express and Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 7.1 must be installed. 
I just tried it and Matlab plots the histogram in about one second. What type are your vector elements? How many bins? (I tried 10 bins and random floats between 0 and 1).
Double (results from a monte carlo simulation), and default number of bins. Pretty weird.
My teacher just said the commands would be similar but only the functions would be different For example: if Y = e^X the command would be similar except for the function in this line. x = 0 &lt; t &amp; t&lt;exp(1) So i was wondering if my commands for the functions were correct or not 
Yes it was installed. Anyways, I installed the visual studio 2010 which is compatible with matlab 2010b, now it works like a charm.
I'm not asking for an answer... I'm asking if someone could explain what I should know to start or where to even start. I know about loops and that I'm supposed to make a function that the end result will be either a one or a zero. This is my 8th week into the course, so all I'm asking for is help. But thanks for your smart ass answer, it surely helped.
A 400,000 element vector takes up ~3.2 MB of memory.... not that much by modern standards. It's very unlikely that computing the hist of this vector is the cause of the memory issues, it may just be the operation that is pushing you over the limit. What else do you have in the workspace? Execute "whos" and look for any large variables that you are no longer using.
Actually, you will need AND in the IF statements, not OR. Also, check out the MOD command to test if a number is divisible by another.
What version of Matlab are you running? In the past I had the same issue with hist and I found one online in the Mathworks libraries that worked a lot better. Try what /r/buo said with random floats of that size. If that also doesn't work, then there's an issue. See if you can update, if not, search the net.
Are you sure it's a vector and not a matrix? If its a matrix the issue might be that it's computing many, many individual histograms and trying to display all of them at one time. It would also be helpful if you post the exact line of code that's giving you trouble. 
If you're 8 weeks in and still need help like this, then you'd benefit from mine. My offer stands. $100. 
Thanks for the tips guys. Turns out that when I was processing the vector before plotting it, something went wrong. Prior to plotting, I had vectortoplot(:) = somefunction(datavector(:)) That caused the error. Funny thing, I used a for loop instead, and now it works. 
I agree with the interpolation first and I also suggest using [`morgenstemning.m`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31761-colormaps-compatible-with-red-green-color-perception-deficiencies/content/colormaps_mathworks_v11/matlab/morgenstemning.m) for a better colormap than jet
$100 for 10 lines of codes?
Would you mind providing the code/data? I don't like the sound of a for loop.
Yep. 
I just found a sample FITS image on the web and tried loading it using data = fitsread(filename) and it works for me just fine. Are you getting an error message? EDIT: formatting
It's actually not an error, it works as intended. 
You don't need to really do anything that complex, actually; Matlab has support for .NET built in! For future reference, the nice thing about .NET is that it doesn't matter if your DLL is written in C#, VB, or C++/CLI. Essentially, to use your dll in Matlab, you just add the DLL to your path and call functions exposed in your dll. If your dll is called 'server.dll' and it has a class called 'NetClass', you could create an object of that class in matlab like so: NET.addAssembly('path\to\server.dll'); obj = NetClass(); That is more or less it. The complexity comes in converting .NET types to Matlab types and vica versa (dynamic arrays, for example). [Here](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/using-net-libraries-in-matlab.html)'s the relevant Mathworks jumpoff page. 
I've modified it quite a bit, but it was like this toplot(:) = normcdf(x(:),mu,sigma) and that caused an out of memory error, while for i = 1:length(x) toplot(i)=normcdf(x(i),mu,sigma); end worked. But there was some other issue with that, I settled for working with the error function eventually.
Anonymous functions! close all fun = @(D) -((3*D)/2 - (3* (D.^ 2 + (85*D)/3 + 25/36).^ (1/2))/2 + 5/12)./(D + 5/3); x = -100:100; y = fun(x); plot(x,y) You have to use dots (.'s) in front of certain operators to specify element-wise operation (vs. matrix operation). You don't need dots when the matrix operation matches the scalar operation (for example adding or multiplying a scalar to a matrix). hope this helps.
welcome to floating point.
is x a vector? I'm confused why toplot=normcdf(x,mu,sigma) wouldn't work just as well. Can you tell me the following? &gt;&gt; size(x) &gt;&gt; size(mu) &gt;&gt; size(sigma) Please make a breakpoint in your code right before the for loop, and then run the size() commands when your code stops there. That way we can see what the variables look like immediately before you call toplot.
&gt; This exact code worked for me before. I'm having trouble believing this, the output of `CurrentCharacter` is an empty or single character string and will never have a numeric value.
Try this code on a version prior to 2014 b and please tell me if it works: data= rand (100,1); figure; plot(data); hold off zoom on h=zoom; set(h,'Motion','horizontal','Enable','on'); waitfor(gcf,'CurrentCharacter',13) % code zoom reset [points,~]=ginput(1); close **EDIT** I figured it out.

you have to put * between numbers and variables. Meaning you can't just type: 3D but you have to type 3*D
Floating points in MATLAB conform to IEEE754, which describes how floats are represented in the computer. Your typical double has the following organization: * 1 sign bit * 11 exponent bits * 52 significand bits A float is represented as (-1)^sign * (1.significand) * 2^(exponent-1023) The value 0 is thus defined as 0 00000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Note that this theoretically is not exactly zero, using the above definition: 1 * 1.0000 * 2^(-1023) This corresponds to roughly 1.1125 x 10^(308), not zero. "Roundoff error" occurs when, after performing floating-point arithmetic, bits on the ends are "thrown off" (when bits are shifted left and right), and we end up losing a bit of value off of the right side. Note that our significand has 32 bits, thus the roundoff precision is limited to 2^-53 (2^(-p-1)), which you'll realize is 1.1102x10^-16 (note that this is exactly 1/8 of your 8.8818x10^-16). I can take a gander as to why the roundoff error here is 2^-50 and not 2^-53. When performing floating-point arithmetic, the exponent values are adjusted until they match, then the significands are added, and then the number is reduced again to simplest form. In this case, your largest number of 8.889 has an exponent of 10000000010 (1026) in floating-point representation, whereas your smallest value of 1.27 has an exponent of 01111111111 (1023). This requires a shift of 3 bits of the significand, which means we lose a precision of 2^3 times our smallest roundoff error of 1.1102x10^16 or, in other words, 8.8818x10^-16.
Here's a way to start or another angle to think about the problem. What's something that your starting vector and resulting vector have in common? In other words, is there any way you can break this into some sort of numbers and a relation between them? Can you then either through loops or vectorizing construct the 2nd given the first? What have you tried, code-wise, other than just showing us your two vectors?
My guess is they're still there. There's some italics in his OP, so OP didn't know the 4 spaces trick.
This will be done the same as any 3D plot with a color mapped surface. The shape itself is unimportant. Not you'll want to get a few rotated views to see the value at all points.
It's been a while since taking a MATLAB course, so I don't know what they teach these days - are they teaching anonymous functions? I've never been exposed to them, nor worked with them, and keep seeing them pop up here. Is this method really quicker than just D = -100:100; Cb = -((3*D)/2 - (3* (D.^ 2 + (85*D)/3 + 25/36).^ (1/2))/2 + 5/12)./(D + 5/3); plot(D,Cb); .. the defining the anonymous function part, relative to just coding it without making the anonymous function.
Not sure what you're looking for, nor what the other reply is getting towards, but I call some Fortran code from MATLAB scripts on a Linux machine using [system()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/system.html)
Try making a matrix where each row is the preceding row, but with 3 added to it: &gt;&gt; x = [5 15 22 35]; &gt;&gt; interval = 3; &gt;&gt; num_intervals = 5; % how many times we want to do this Now let's set up our matrix: &gt;&gt; x_mat = repmat(x,num_intervals,1); Now we need to offset each row. You could simply loop through each row one at a time, line this: &gt;&gt; for i = 1:num_intervals &gt;&gt; x_mat(i,:)=x_mat(i,:)+interval*(i-1); &gt;&gt; end Or you could do it in once fancy step: &gt;&gt; x_mat = x_mat + repmat((0:num_intervals-1)'*interval,1,size(x_mat,2)); What we did there is generate a matrix that looks like this: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 9 9 9 9 12 12 12 12 And add it to our x_mat. If you want to put it back into a vector again, you can just refer to it by &gt;&gt; reshape(x_mat',1,[]);

Are you looking for [nested functions](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html)?
If you're just looking for the basic function to plot the sphere, assuming you've got appropriate x,y,z coordinates, what you probably want is `surf`. For example, to just make a "disco ball" with a sphere of random grayscale values, you could do: [x,y,z]=sphere(50); c=rand(51); surf(x,y,z,c); axis image; colormap(gray); See the help for any of these functions if you don't know what they do, and it should become pretty clear...
You can define local help functions within a function file. Then you can call it from within the main function. You can't make global functions without making separate files for them. 
If you want the function within a script and not a function. The only function you can make is an anonymous function fx: y = @(x) = 2*x+3
eeh. Could you show the rest of your code? (or at least the essential stuff). My crystal ball broke yesterday so it's kind of difficult for me to see what's going wrong without seeing your actual code.
Thanks but this is *much* more complicated than that. There is no even remotely good way to handle it like that. Thanks anyway though
If you have a sample of any *arbitrary* distribution there are two main ways to generate a PDF (and from a PDF, the CDF). **Histogram** Easy to understand and people know what they are looking at but it is sensitive to not enough data and to the size of the bin. Also produces an inherently not-smooth function **[Kernel Density Estimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)[KDE]** (preferred in my opinion). Completely smooth result and can be done with fewer samples. Usual kernel is a gaussian however, the choice of kernel width is important (like choice of bin size for histogram). Can also produce unphysical results due to artifacts of decay. For example, if you build one with a `rand` you will see some decay outside of `[0 1]`. For KDE, matlab has [`ksdensity`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/ksdensity.html) which you can then use with `cumtrapz` to generate a CDF. Alternatively, there is a popular code simply called [`kde`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14034-kernel-density-estimator) that also outputs the CDF. In my field, I see a lot of generated PDFs from samples of function and I almost always see it in the form of a KDE. And when I do see it in a histogram, it never looks very pretty Here is a simple example x = rand(1e4,1); U = exp(x); [f,xi] = ksdensity(U); % Use the defaults cdf = cumtrapz(xi,f); figure(1) plotyy(xi,f,xi,cdf)

And now that you mention it, it does seem to make more sense. I was having trouble finding straightforward examples to help me learn it. Thank you for the help. 
It's not quicker, it's just depends on how often he wants to call this equation and if he want to call it over different ranges of values of X or at different frequencies of X values. There might not be a right answer, but anonymous functions *are* an important part of MATLAB programming. They are easy to write and very useful and a lot of MATLAB functions require them for particular features.
There's no file extension? It's not '3c442.fits" or something? Try to include the full path filename, i.e. 'c:\...\3c442.fits".
Hey thanks for the jumping off point!! Wish I could give you more than imaginary internet points. 
The only way I know to do something like that would be; h = get(gca); hC = arrayfun(@(x)... ...get(h.Children(x)),1:length(h.Children),'UniformOutput',0); cellfun(@(x) strcmp(x.Type,'line'),A); hCl = hC(ans); xss = cellfun(@(x) x.XData,hCl,'UniformOutput',0); yss = cellfun(@(x) x.YData,hCl,'UniformOutput',0) subplot(2,1,2); hold on; cellfun(@(x,y) plot(x,y),xss,yss) I doubt this is easier than just issuing the commands again. If you want help how to change the view after plotting I can help with that too. 
No problem! By the way, one gotcha I forgot about is making sure the platform of your DLL and your copy of Matlab are compatible. By this I mean, if you are running a 64-bit version of Matlab, you can only load assemblies that are compatible with 64-bit, which include x64 and AnyCPU. Similarly, 32-bit Matlab can only load x86 and AnyCPU assemblies. You can check/set the target platform of your C# project in Visual Studio in the project's properties (PROJECT &gt; Properties &gt; Build &gt; Platform target). On Matlab, you can check the platform with the command "computer('arch')", which will return either 'win32' or 'win64'.
Yes it works in 2013b if I put in just 48. Interestingly, if I put char(48) or even char(13) in the 2013b release I get "Error Value must be numeric" I didn't think to try the char() method in the old version until your suggestion. I'm not sure what has changed...
if n = 2 then the for loop goes from 2 to 4 the line after the for loop indexes position i+1; when i is 4, this means that the element of x0 it indexes is the fifth one. This causes an error because x0 only has 4 elements.
Write a for loop from i=1:2 and store the desired angle input for the plot in a vector/matrix = angle and call the desired set by angle(i,:) for a matrix or angle(i) for a vector. And change subplot to subplot(2,1,i). basically.... a1 = 10; a2 = 30; angle = [a1, a2]; figure(1) for i = 1:2 subplot(2,1,i) Angle_of_interest = angle(i); %use this angle for plot setting that changes Other plot settings; end 
I think this will work a little better. Defines the number of rows in b. Creates b filled with zeros and then grabs the correct values of a to go into the corresponding column in b. a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]; Columns = 4; c=length(a); d = c/Columns; b=zeros(d,Columns); for j= 1:Columns first = 1+d*(j-1); last = d*j; b(:,j) = a(first:last); end
As the sidebar says, we don't do your homework. What have you tried? Where are you getting stuck? Have you tried emailing your prof/TA?
No. Source: tried it. edit: well there's a way around it, maybe. Presumably because you want to run these in parallel the arguments for each iteration of the loop at each level are independent of the result of other iterations. So, as long as those arguments can be known before each loop runs, then maybe you can put your code into functions that can be called using parfeval(). so, say you had something like: for i = 1:4 for j = 1:7 %here's your code that takes something like i and j as arguments, although I'm sure the situation is probably more complicated than this. end end you could instead do mypool = gcp; %presumably you've opened up a pool with sufficient workers. If not some of the jobs initiated below will wait in queue until some workers become available. for i = 1:4 for j = 1:7 D(count) = parfeval(mypool,@myfunction,0,i,j,inputData); %the third argument is the number of outputs. Modify as necessary. %if the loops have different numbers of outputs, then make a separate function for each. count = count + 1; end end wait(D) %then pull the results from D when complete. This way each iteration of your loop at every level gets its own worker and runs concurrently, which I believe is what you'd like to achieve. Note however that each worker will get it's own copy of inputData, so as long as there's not crazy overhead related to that copying, this should give you a speedup. I spent more time than I'd like to admit doing what you're suggesting, and unfortunately matlab won't let you do it. If you post some more detail about what's actually inside your loops then maybe someone could suggest a trick if this one doesn't do it for you. 
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Euler+method+IVP This is a good way to get started
 Try stem(n,x). Plotting the data in x against the data of n. See documentation or help for more detail. Use doc stem or help stem to read more. 
Tits and ass man, The stem function is not receiving any info about the index. It is therefore not aware of your first index. Go to the command line and type doc stem and see the example for stem(x, y). Also consider renaming the variable x so it is not confusing for you. 
&gt; stem(n,x) That works perfectly thanks sooo much :)
If the data you filtered out was beyond some threshold, then perhaps the best replacement value is the threshold itself. Thus, anything beyond the threshold is clipped. This means your data won't be differentiable--not sure if that's an issue. Clipped data also has infinite frequency content if you are doing a frequency domain transform on your data. I can't think of any other value that would make sense for filling in. The white holes are completely surrounded by blue, so any nearest neighbor algorithm means the hole is also blue.
A few things... First - is this PIV data? It looks like it. If so, your software will have some post-processing algorithms to handle 2d interpolation for vectors that failed the pass criteria of the autocorrelation. It would also help to take more data and average it together to remove the pock marks. Second - If it isn't, you can handle this in the same way. For every single vector you have, look at a metric - magnitude will be fine. If your magnitude of your vector is much larger or smaller than the surrounding vectors, replace the vector with a mean or median of the vectors surrounding it. Code shouldn't be too hard to create. You can also run this same routine if you know which vectors were due to a failed calculation or something, depending on how you took the data (for example, PIV data files will tell you if the vectors are 'failed vectors' when calculated, and then you can perform the appropriate algorithm only on those). In either case, this will change your experimental uncertainty since you are altering the original data set. It will be necessary to mention in your data reporting, depending on how you handle the measurement uncertainty.
I think that they're erroneous because this is a PIV measurement of a (relatively) uniform flow field and these same artifacts show up in every single data set I have so it's likely that they're the results of a smudge on the glass between our measurement plane and the camera. I don't think its an effect of undersampling because my data set is 128x128 points. And yeah, right now I've just clipped out the points beyond a constant value but if I make that value too close to high, I could potentially be loosing the real trends that I'm looking for. 
If it's smudges on the glass, I'd replace those vectors by the local mean or median. It is your safest best without ruining the rest of the measured data. If you are using Insight3G to capture your images, the 4th column in the .vec files contain an indicator if they are failed vectors. I typically use the 4th column to find failed vectors and replace them by the local mean or median.
Any interpolation you do needs to be able to handle "high-order" interpolation. Two possible options: a [L2 projection] (http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DN2260/fem12/M2.pdf) (essentially a fancy least-squares method) or a [Lagrange] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) nodal approach. I recommend the Lagrange approach, the points you interpolate with need to be chosen carefully to avoid [ill-conditioning] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number). A good choice is the nodes in a [Gauss-Legendre quadrature] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature): I have a function [here] (https://github.com/userjjb/DG-for-Conservation-Laws/blob/master/2D-DG-Conservation/GLquad.m) that generates them for you for a number of points N; all you need to use is Qx, Qw are not needed for interpolation. Now you want to use a [tensor product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) (example [here] (http://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/curvefit_product/tspdem_01.png)) of the 1D node points to span your domain. Essentially chose a Cartesian direction, say 'x' and scale Qx to fully span along that direction Qx =(Qx*(B-A)/2 + (B+A)/2; where B and A are the bounds along that direction) This creates the 2D tensor grid of points r_{i,j} (i,j &lt;=N) where r_{x,y} = Qx(i),Qx(j) Now look at the value of your data at each point z(x,y) = z(r). For any points that are in the white region remove them from each Qx that intersects that point. By the time you are done you will have 2N customized 'Qx's p=1:N for x and q=1:N for y. Now loop through each Qx and find the 1D interpolation, I have a function [here] (https://github.com/userjjb/DG-for-Conservation-Laws/blob/master/2D-DG-Conservation/Lagrange.m) that can evaluate them. Now for each point calculate zh=Qx_p(i)*Qx_q(j). The matrix of zh is your interpolated data. This works because by removing the unwanted interpolation points in each Qx so the resulting interpolation doesn't capture the unwanted data. If your data had too many holes eventually the interpolations would become ill-conditioned, but it shouldn't be too bad here.
If you want to see the values of a point you can use the plot tools in the figure window. If you want to see them without clicking I don't know.
You can use bode with tf(num,den) instead of freqs: han = figure(1); [num1, den1] = cheby1(N,R,Wn,'s'); bode(tf(num1,den1),w); hold on; [num2,den2] = ellip(N,1,40, 2*pi*1000,'s'); bode(tf(num2,den2),w,'r'); 
awesome thanks heaps :)
I told you this last time you solicited money for your help. We discourage this here.
Do you have these two results printed in a matrix like [fahrenheit, Kelvin]? Because you can just call that matrix a variable, such as A. Then for your fprintf line, end it with A' instead of fahrenheit,kelvin after the single quotation marks.
[fprintf()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html) doesn't work that way. It works something like: temp = 303.2442; unit = 'Kelvin'; fid = fopen('filename.txt','w'); fprintf(fid,'%6.2f\t %s\n', temp, unit); where fid is a valid open file identifier (integer or -1 if invalid), temp is a scalar (float and double) and unit is a string. Check the linked documentation for more on how to be more specific in how to write what you want to write. The above should appear in a text file (filename.txt) like this (complete with carriage return to a blank 2nd (or following) line): 303.24 Kelvin 
So what? Are you a mod? Hall monitor? I don't see anything in the sidebar about this. 
Remove the loop. * Define: theta = (pi/2):0.01:(5*pi/2) * Remove the for loop completely * cos and acos can operate on vectors But while operating with vectors, use .* or ./ for element by element operation theta = (pi/2):0.01:(5*pi/2); q = r*cos(theta); phi = acos(q/leta); wbc = (r*wab*sin(theta))./(leta*sin(phi)); vc = -(wab*r*cos(theta))-(leta*wbc.*cos(phi)); phii = acos(q/li); wbci = (r*wab*sin(theta))./(li*sin(phii)); vci = -(wab*r*cos(theta))-(li*wbci.*cos(phii)); phiii = acos(q/lii); wbcii = (r*wab*sin(theta))./(lii*sin(phiii)); vcii = -(wab*r*cos(theta))-(lii*wbcii.*cos(phiii)); %% figure, plot(theta,vc,'b-') hold on; plot(theta,vci,'g-') plot(theta,vcii,'r-') legend('eta','2.5i','m3') xlabel('Theta (radians)'); ylabel('Velocity (m/s)'); axis ([(pi/2) (3*pi) -40 40])
Actually fprintf can work like his example above. It just wouldn't print to a text file, it would display it in the command window in MATLAB instead. Also, if you are outputting to a textfile, you need to put \r by the \n since notepad and other windows programs don't recognize a new line command without it. And you should close the file at the end of your code by fclose(fid);
Say you are plotting y against x. figure, plot(x,y,'o') labels = num2str(y); text(x,y,labels,... 'horizontal','left','vertical','bottom') grid on This will plot y against x and display the value of y next to each point
His first example wouldn't work.
I tried it that way too but the same thing happens function [ kelvin,rankine,fahrenheit ] = temperature_conversions(f,c ) %converts farenheit and celsius to kelvin and rankine % has three subfunctions for conversions kelvin = F_to_K(f); rankine = C_to_R(c); fahrenheit = C_to_F(c); matrix = [f kelvin c rankine c fahrenheit]; FID = fopen('\t\t\tTemperature_Conversion_Tables.txt','w'); fprintf(FID,'\tTemperature Conversion\n\n'); fprintf(FID,'Fahrenheit\t\t Kelvin\t\t Celsius\t\t Rankine\t\t Celsius\t\t Fahrenheit\n\n'); fprintf(FID,'%7.2f\t\t %7.2f\t\t %7.2f\t\t %7.2f\t\t %7.2f\t\t %7.2f\n\n',matrix); fclose(FID); end function [result1] = F_to_K(f) result1 = (5/9)*(f+459.67); end function [result2] = C_to_R(c) result2 = (9/5)*c+32+459.67; end function [result3] = C_to_F(c) result3 = (9/5)*c+32; end 
What does your FID return? Is that really your file path? \t\t\tTemperature_Conversion_Tables.txt In your fprintf calls, you need to specify {file identification}, {string of how to interpret what you're writing}, {what you write}. You *can* output fprintf to the screen by omitting the file id. The two lines following your fopen() call won't work, even if you do have a valid FID.
I'm not sure, it's local to the function file
A mixer usually multiplies the signal with a particular frequency. Then by the trigonometric formula of a product of sines (sinA* sinB), you get components at f+fc and f-fc. Maybe that helps? I need some more info before I can understand it. What modulation are you using?
First off I have to say: It looks really trippy, cool! As for your problem: I really have no idea of it is possible to erease a specific plot when they are all in the same figure (i'm afraid it won't work like that). A possible solution though would be plotting multiple iterations at the same time (so you plot iteration 1:30). Then delete them all and plot the iteration 2:31, delete, 3:32 etc. etc. It's far from perfect but at least the running time would be consistent this way.
Well for a start, matlab arrays start at index 1 not zero so you'll have to modify the code for that
So symsum is apparently a function in the symbolic math toolbox, which I don't have any experience with. I am also not sure if I am getting your question. In your expression, is (1+i)^k the formula for which you want entries in the array, for various values of k? In which case, what is k? If it is the entries in t, then you just do a = (1+i).^ t; where i needs to be some predefined integer (it will default to being the imaginary unit). You need to add the . before the exponentiation to prevent matrix operations.
First things first, what have you tried? As a first point to start, how would/can you make an array that is 50 in length from 2 to 100? &lt;-- starting a line with 4 spaces will format anything that's code nicely Do you get any errors with what you've tried?
Let's just do OPs HW for him..
For starters, google the linspace() function. That'll help you generate the x values to plot MATLAB's version of the cosine function. 
ahh no sorry my question is worded badly, also im not sure how to do symbols on here so i've linked to wolfram alpha.. so i want to end up with an array where each element in the arrray has this in it: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+%281+%2B+i%29%5Ek+k%3D0+to+k%3Dt and the value for t is taken from the corresponding element in the array t, which should look like this: [1 2 3 4 5...25] so ill end up with a 1 by 25 array where each element is a sum based on the above formula... Thanks for replying!
The OpenGL renderer uses 32-bit floats internally, and you're running into the limits of single precision. By default, Matlab's datenum uses a large offset which eats up the first 19-bits of the available 23-bits in single precision format (i.e. 19 ~ log2(now)). The easiest workaround is to subtract a large date offset, which you're already using for figure #4. There's a similar problem with the bar function: http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1mefb6/bar_rendering_breaking_when_using_serial_time_data/
My error messages when running the ODE45 are: Attempt to reference field of non-structure array.

Error in ode45 (line 114) [neq, tspan, ntspan, next, t0, tfinal, tdir, y0, f0, odeArgs, odeFcn, ... which mean nothing to me.
I tried and it didn't work
I don't know if you entered the function incorrectly because I dont know what the functions are supposed to be (no I'm not your professor unfortunately :P) , but the graphs seem plausible to me. If you plot the vertical position you will see it goes up and then down below z=0. I assume z=0 is the ground so you want to avoid z&lt;0 values, therefore use an if statement in model2d to check that criterium and if it holds dy should be 0. Or you can just plot the values until z=0. Also plot x vs z which will make it more clear.
The functions are just the Drag and Magnus force plus gravity. I checked them and they are entered correctly. What I meant was whether I forgot a semicolon or forgot to reference the correct vector. How do I plot z specifically? In my case y(2) is the z position (once again assuming that I am understanding how MATLAB works). I don't even know why we need the : in the plot y(:,1). I see a lot of examples where people use them but nowhere does it explain what it means. You have already saved me hours of agony so thank you very much for all the advice.
y(:,1) returns all row values ( : means all in this case) of the first column of y. In your case column 1 is x, column 2 is z. 3 and 4 are the velocities.
&gt;which mean nothing to me This is one part about becoming a better programmer (in general): learning how to interpret and debug error messages. It took me about 3 or 4 years before I was comfortable with how to trace through them (and also effectively utilize the documentation to use new functions I never even saw in a classroom). I've been able to use what I've learned from debugging MATLAB errors to errors I get trying to "plug into" some FORTRAN code, a language I have less than 6 months total using. The (long-winded) point is, don't just brush off the error messages as "meaning nothing". They carry a vast amount of information and certainly mean something, learning to step through them and debug is a great skill that takes a while to learn - keep at it.
Impulses can be difficult to simulate because of adaptive timestepping (I don't actually know if ode23s does it, but many of MATLABs ODE solvers do). Since you know in advance when the impulse will happen, you can just run one instance of ode23s with the timespan going to 42. Then, you can take the final state from that, change n(5), and shove it right back into a second instance of ode23s, going from t=42 to whatever your terminal time is.
http://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html You can make a system using the transfer function command... you might need to re-write your TF in a different form first. 
The colour typically depends on the 'colormap' of the figure. In all versions older than the current r2014b this colormap is called jet. So if you use a command like imagesc to plot an array it defaults to jet. If that image is a binary image then it'll appear as blue and red instead of black and white unless you specify a grey colormap. If you use imread to load an image file the commands like imshow, imagesc etc respect the rgb colouring.
If this is PIV data I would recommend getting much better images and vector maps before you go messing about with interpolation. As well as preprocessing, preprocessing may be needed. Background subtraction is particularly useful when you haven't got a clean view.
 vector = [2 3 4 4 5 4 6 4 4]; idx_to_delete = find(vector==4); vector(idx_to_delete) = [];
There's a block called 'initial value' which does this.
Thank you! I did not know you could use a vector to be an "index" to another vector!
I haven't looked at it too closely, but one thing that stands out is, shouldn't "r" be in radians? And do you need semicolons between the rows of your matrix? (I haven't used the line command before so this might be a silly comment) Also are you using the plot command correctly? I'm not sure it takes a line object as an input. (notice that you seem to want to draw a black line but you're drawing a blue one)
Yep! Real handy feature of the language
You are definitely right about r being in radians -- alternatively, you could use the cosd() and sind() functions if you would rather just stick to degrees.
Thank you.
Don't call plot for every pass of the loop. Matlab will have to destroy and create a new plot each time. Set up a plot outside the loop and give it a handle name. Then set the Xdata and Ydata of the plot in the loop.
Alternatively: vector = [2 3 4 4 5 4 6 4 4]; vector(vector==4) = [];
thanks I have it figured out, I made a matrix of y values and plotted them all at once. 
Here's how I would go about it. Use an initialize script (a separate matlab script) that would load into your workspace. Then run that script when the model starts (Menu File -&gt; Model Properties -&gt; Callbacks -&gt;"PreLoadFcn"). -------------------------------- 1) In your model, use a gain block and set the value to gain_multiplier. The input to this block should be (X-Y) 2) Make a separate script **init_params.m** if(condition met) then gain_multiplier=2 else gain_multiplier=1 3) In the model, set the script to run when the model starts
Ah yeah. I should have clarified; I need to do this about 200 times. Thats the real issue here.
http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/replace_block.html
basically: 200 "rules" set into a while loop/state machine. during each iteration of the while loop, the multiplier is the same on all rules. However, on the next iteration, it needs to be able to change.
The line command draws a line object. If you set h12 to be equal to line then h12 is a graphics handle, not your coordinates. Here is a quick and dirty example: xx = [0,0]; yy = [0,1]; h12 = line(xx,yy); xlim([-1 1]) ylim([-1 1]) for theta = 0:720 theta = 90 - theta; xx = get(h12,'Xdata'); yy = get(h12,'Ydata'); xx = yy.*cosd(theta) - xx.*sind(theta); yy = yy.*sind(theta) + xx.*cosd(theta); set(h12,'Xdata',xx) set(h12,'Ydata',yy) drawnow end 
you can, you need to write a script to [read in the model](http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/find_system.html) and then use the [add_block](http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/add_block.html) to add the gain you need. It's been a while since I've done this but it can be done. obviously you'll need to add in some conditional statements but writing this small bit of code will definitely save you in the long run and you won't have to worry about accidentally missing a block somewhere
A=[your data in a row vector] B=vertcat([A,A,A,A]); Or data in a column vector, but using hozcat 
Happy cake day! and thanks for the reply, I'll give this a try when I'm back at my computer.
Have a look at the [table](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.html) function.
Yes, vertcat works, but repmat is a perhaps more elegant solution. Let's say you have a 1×1023 row vector: data = zeros(1,1023); % arbitrary data: 1×1023 row vector of zeros Then, use repmat to copy your data to make four identical rows: data_copied = repmat(data,4,1); % 4 copies along dimension 1, keep only the original single copy along dimension 2 Then, if you want to rearrange this into a new row vector of the form [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0...], use the reshape command: data_new = reshape(data_copied,1,4092); % 4092 columns and one row This could be done in a single line of code: data_new = reshape(repmat(data,4,1),1,[]); This time I've replaced 4092 with the placeholder [], which tells Matlab to create however many columns are necessary given that you want only one row. Edit: The final two arguments for 'reshape' seem to have been in the wrong order. (I'm on mobile and can't test this, but this is more or less how it should work. You may or may not need to take the transpose of data_copied before using reshape if the reshape command takes elements rowwise rather than columnwise, but I don't think this is the case.)
Well you could just loop row by row and always print n(j) and F(j) for each row. 
Can someone explain me the logic behind this ?
that's awesome. Thank you so much!!! 
Why not just use: [Years(:) Fvals(:)] Then write it to the command window, file or whatever.
http://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ref/ssbmod.html
For simple things you can use anonymous functions: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html For more complex methods... I think that's just how matlab works, as far as i know... the solution you described is the best I've come up with as well. Is there a reason you don't like calling different function files? Just aesthetics? 
I am using imread and imshow? Can you help me how to do it? Here is the code attached to a button: global a; [archivo ruta]=uigetfile({'*.gif';'*.jpg'},'abrir imagen'); if isequal(archivo,0)%si el usuario no eleige ningun archivo return else a=imread(strcat(ruta,archivo)); axis(handles.axes2); imshow(a); msgbox('Se abrio con exito','mensaje'); Now im trying to use a color selected by some sliders and saved into another axes control when i push another button ... but i don't know how.. i've been readinf about spliting into 3 RGB channels,etc.. Help me please..
Yes. You can control Simulink programmatically. But it depends entirely how you have it set up. A screen shot would help a lot in trying to figure out what you want to do.
If you want a single slider to be able to change the color of an image it is simpler to work in the HSV colorspace rather than RGB colorspace. imgdata = rand(100, 100); % Make random data imgBin = imgdata &gt; 0.8; % Turn it into binary (1's and 0's) random data % Assemble into HSV array % First layer is color % Second layer is saturation (0 is white, 1 is pure color) % Third layer is intensity (0 is black, 1 is bright) imgHSV = double(cat(3, zeros(size(imgBin, 1), size(imgBin, 2)), ... zeros(size(imgBin, 1), size(imgBin, 2)), ... imgBin)); % Modify color of non-black parts of image by changing first layer to new % color value, second layer to all ones (so it shows color, not white) imgHSV_2 = (imgHSV); NewColor_1 = 0.2; imgHSV_2(:,:,1) = NewColor_1*ones(size(imgHSV, 1), size(imgHSV, 2)); imgHSV_2(:,:,2) = ones(size(imgHSV, 1), size(imgHSV, 2)); % Modify color again to a new color by changing a single value imgHSV_3 = (imgHSV); NewColor_2 = 0.6; imgHSV_3(:,:,1) = NewColor_2*ones(size(imgHSV, 1), size(imgHSV, 2)); imgHSV_3(:,:,2) = ones(size(imgHSV, 1), size(imgHSV, 2)); % Display assembed images figure() subplot(1, 3, 1); imshow(hsv2rgb(imgHSV)); title('Original Image') subplot(1, 3, 2); imshow(hsv2rgb(imgHSV_2)); title('First Modified Image') subplot(1, 3, 3); imshow(hsv2rgb(imgHSV_3)); title('Second Modified Image')
If you are used to writing object oriented code in C# you might find [classes](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/classes-in-the-matlab-language.html) more intuitive. In a class you can define multiple public and private methods in a single file. Disallowing function definitions in scripts appears to be an intentional design choice. It forces people to modularize their code and makes working with workspaces more intuitive. If you are looking for a way to keep track of multiple related functions use a [package](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html). A typical programming workflow is to use a script as a driver for an entry point function which in turn calls other functions and so on. In C terms, the script would be a batch file that calls your program and the entry point function would be your "main" function. 
I am using 3 sliders RGB to pick up the color (which i already did succesfully), basically what i need to do is to load an image with black letters (and white background) and apply that color to those letters everytime i hit the button ... Maybe if you look at the code now, you will help me implement it better... I'm just starting with RGB for now and i don't understant at all the HSV code, i'm so confused :( [code](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iofwdez4wiwlfay/AAAHyV0gruX5cvcdv5TJgxUla?dl=0) 
if any file is a function file itself, it can have sub-functions callable within that same file. e.g. **main.m** function main() data = load_data(); results = calculations(data); display_results(results); end function data = load_data() % ... end function results= calculations(data) % ... end function display_results(results) % ... end but then `load_data()`, `calculations(data)`, and `display_results(results)` are only callable from **main.m** and nowhere outside the file. Not sure if that's what you're looking for. 
Good solution. You could use the same approach to generate linear indices which would then preserve the dimensionality of the vector (a row vector would remain a row vector and a column vector would remain a column vector): data = rand(1,1023); data2 = data'; ind = reshape(repmat(1:numel(data),4,1),1,[]); data_new = data( ind ); size(data_new) ans = 1 4092 data2_new = data2( ind ); size(data2_new) ans = 4092 1 
What do you mean x-y isn't a block? Are you using Stateflow? If you are using stateflow and need to replace code you can use [find and replace](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stateflow/ug/using-the-search-replace-tool.html). There is also a [Stateflow API](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stateflow/api/overview-of-the-stateflow-api.html) with a find method, but it has a steeper learning curve. If you are using Simulink you can use [find_system](http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/find_system.html) and [replace_block](http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/replace_block.html). If you are using Simulink, the question that needs to be answered is how are these "x-y" blocks distinguished from other blocks? Name of the block? Name of the signals they are connected to? Name of the blocks they are connected to? You can use find_system to identify blocks based on all these distinguishing features, but the parameters that you need to examine are different for each one. We really need more information on exactly what you want to do (with screenshots) to tell you how to do it. 
The code above runs in R2013b with only built-in functions. The bit on line 14 is the only part that shouldn't be immediately obvious and the whole thing should be straightforward to work into your GUI. Is there a particular part you are having trouble with? 
Thanks, i will keep that in mind.
Are you trying to recolor the image? Then you need to weight the rgb balance. So yes multiply each colour channel by a weighting factor. Matlab represents these as a 3D array.
Cool! I hadn't thought to do that with the indices. My solution was actually intended to preserve the dimensionality, but my arguments seem to have been out of order (now maybe fixed? still on mobile...).
 allAxesInFigure = findall(figureHandle,'type','axes'); Replace figureHandle with the handle to your particular figure, or gcf. This will return a vector of handles to the two axes in the figure you can use with any function that accepts an axis handle as an argument. I suspect you will find that text as either a title in the top axis or as a text string. Dig into the axis structure using "get" to see what you can find
Thank you very much!
Hi, thanks a lot for the reply. Between you and the others, I've come to the following: % Rotation Variable r = 90; % initial x,y pos x = [0,0,0]; y = [0,10,0]; line(x,y, 'LineWidth', 3, 'Color', 'k'); hold on; new = [x,y] * [cosd(r), sind(r), 0; -sind(r), cosd(r), 0; 0, 0, 1]; line(new); But I'm still having issues. "Inner matrix dimensions must agree" and only my initial line is drawn. Unless I'm mistaken, I should have amended this by adding the additional 0 points to x and y, as the number of columns doesn't need to match, only the rows. Of course, I do seem to be mistaken and I'm not sure how to go about this, if you don't mind, I'd like to know what exactly the issue is here. edit: just so you know, I specifically need to use a matrix here and I want to have more than one instance on the screen drawn at once, not a constantly rotating line like you have supplied (great work though, will come in very useful soon)
Yes thanks a lot. You are completely correct and I have attempted to amend the issue. If you don't mind, I could use some help with the issue I posted further down. I added semicolons and used cosd/sind. I scrapped the plot command and implemented it appropriately. I just have issues now with using a rotational matrix specifically
Thanks. 
i'm running R2014a ...what is img? the original image?? i dont know how to get it from my axes2 then.. i just pasted that code into my pushbutton and replaced the rgb variables with the values of my sliders .. function pushbutton2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) r=get(handles.Slider_red,'value'); g=get(handles.Slider_green,'value'); b=get(handles.Slider_blue,'value'); set(handles.axes1,'Color',[ r g b]); imgData = rand(100, 100); % Pull these three values from your sliders: redval = r; greenval = g; blueval = b; 
Yes, just the text in the image. I dont know how to do that. I'm lost. :S Here is my [code](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iofwdez4wiwlfay/AAAHyV0gruX5cvcdv5TJgxUla?dl=0)
Do you have a specific question? What code do you have? 4 spaces starting a line makes code not follow reddit's formatting. Do you get any errors? Are you just trying to adapt the previous code to work indefinitely and not just for N-times?
This is probably a question best answered by MathWorks.
I have indeed posted there but figured it is worth trying a large base to see if anyone else may have encountered similar issues. 
1. Your x0 must have at least 2*n+3 elements, otherwise your function will eventually try to access an x(n) for which it has no value. 2. You should also rearrange your loop. In the posted code xp(1) has 0. Unless you want xp(1) to be 0, it is better to start the loop at 1 and end it at 2*n-1
I don't really know what you mean by "doppler shift a binary sequence" but if you're looking to stretch or compress a row vector, your best bet may be to get creative with interpolation. There are plenty of obviously-named, well documented functions to get you interpolating in no time.
Sorry - img should be imgData. Small error that I've edited to be correct above. To pass the image data between callbacks the best way is to assign it into either the handles structure or into the guidata property of your figure. When you load or generate the image, do something like this to put it into the guidata field: imgData = load('img_file_name.jpg'); guidata(FigureHandle, imgData); Then you can pull that same data back out elsewhere with: imgData = guidata(FigureHandle); To implement that in your callback function, it would look like this: function pushbutton2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) redval=get(handles.Slider_red,'value'); greenval=get(handles.Slider_green,'value'); blueval=get(handles.Slider_blue,'value'); imgData = guidata(handles.FigureHandle); rgbVect = [redval, greenval, blueval]; img_rgb = reshape(imgData(:)*rgbVect, [size(imgData, 1), size(imgData,2), 3]); delete(get(handles.axis1, 'Children')); % Clear everything from image axes imshow(img_rgb, 'Parent', handles.axis1); 
I put guidata(FigureHandle, a); (a the name of variable with the image in the other function...) after the imread and pasted the code in the button function Nothing happened :( I'm having bad luck, can you take the code for me and change it PLEASE :)
Within the callback functions you can use gcbf to get the figure handle for your gui. So after the imread command in line 223 or so of your code you'll want to assign the image data (a) into the guidata with guidata(gcbf, a); then pull that data back out in the pushbutton callback (starts at line 122) with: imgData = guidata(gcbf); That should get you on the right track. 
I got errors: Undefined function or variable 'FigureHandle'. Error in a7mad_color_edit&gt;Untitled_2_Callback (line 234) guidata(FigureHandle, a); Error in gui_mainfcn (line 95) feval(varargin{:}); Error in a7mad_color_edit (line 42) gui_mainfcn(gui_State, varargin{:}); Error in @(hObject,eventdata)a7mad_color_edit('Untitled_2_Callback',hObject,eventdata,guidata(hObject)) Error while evaluating uimenu Callback
Yup, specifically `interp1` should do pretty much what you need, OP.
Yup, this will do the trick. Just interpolate it to a stretched/compressed/nonlinear/whatever time axis. Should be cake. 
[Here's a picture of what I mean by doppler shift.](http://i.imgur.com/Wa7ZdL1.png) But it is basically a stretching or compressing of one of the signals. But I'll take a look into interpolating and see what I can get done with that. Thanks for the reply.
Hmmm, so does this function shift the elements of the matrix? So say A = [1 0 1 1 0] B = circshift(A, 2); B = [1 1 0 1 0] ? 
That's what would happen if you hadn't assigned the figure handle into the variable FigureHandle before calling guidata. The edited comment using gcbf will work, though. 
&gt; A = imread('peppers.png'); &gt; thresh = 200; &gt; Ar = A(:,:,1); &gt; Ag = A(:,:,2); &gt; Ab = A(:,:,3); &gt; logmap = zeros([size(A,1),size(A,2)]); &gt; logmap = (Ar &gt; thresh).* (Ab &gt; thresh).* (Ag &gt; thresh); &gt; Ar(logmap == 1) = 255; &gt; Ag(logmap == 1) = 0; &gt; Ab(logmap == 1) = 0; &gt; A = cat(3 ,Ar,Ag,Ab); &gt; imshow(A); That will change the color of any pixels with an intensity above the value in thresh to the color defined by [Ar, Ag, Ab]. It's a different approach from what I was doing, but will work. 
No it's still not working
What should it change ?
Can you do it for me i can pay you...
It didnt work
Tip for the future - 'It didnt work' is pretty useless as far as a reply when you're trying to get help with a computer or programming issue. You need to at least copy + paste the error message that you receive so that someone else can see *why* it didn't work. Using this image: http://imgur.com/myD1n21 and changing Untitled_2_Callback to this: function Untitled_2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) %global a; [archivo ruta]=uigetfile({'*.gif';'*.jpg'},'abrir imagen'); if isequal(archivo,0)%si el usuario no eleige ningun archivo return else handles.a=imread(strcat(ruta,archivo)); axis(handles.axes2); imshow(handles.a); guidata(gcbf, handles); msgbox('Se abrio con exito','mensaje'); end and changing pushbutton2_Callback to this: function pushbutton2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) % hObject handle to pushbutton2 (see GCBO) % eventdata reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB % handles structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA) % first i get values of the sliders r=get(handles.Slider_red,'value'); g=get(handles.Slider_green,'value'); b=get(handles.Slider_blue,'value'); % second setting pb color % by setting the value of backgroundcolor it a vector = [ red green blue] % the allowable value betwwen 0 and 1 imgData = double(handles.a); rgbVect = [r, g, b]; img_rgb = reshape(imgData(:)*rgbVect, [size(imgData, 1), size(imgData,2), 3]); delete(get(handles.axes2, 'Children')); imshow(uint8(img_rgb), 'Parent', handles.axes2); yields a GUI that changes the color of the white pixels in the displayed image to the color given by the sliders. I do not know what you were getting at with the second axis and the backgroundcolor property as that doesn't seem to be what you were going for. 
Yes i know, i'm sorry ...it's just that i don't understand anything in this language, neither its documentation and i've been trying to learn and get so frustrated ... and english is not my native language as well... That did work, although it changes the background and not the color of the letters as it's supossed to...
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4196417/can-someone-explain-the-behavior-of-the-functions-mkpp-and-ppval answers your question
I think you're missing something. Your T matrices are 4x4, right? You can't solve 6 unknowns with a 4x4 matrix.
you need to be careful with your function inputs. Notice that the first time you use line you input line(x,y...) where x is a row vector and y is too. The second time it's line(new) where new is a 2x3 matrix... Line is asking for 2 vectors, not one matrix. If you use line(new(1,:),new(2,:)) I think it does what you want. 
No problem. I just learned of this f'n in the past month so I've been playing with it quite a bit.
What should I do then? 
The code I wrote does change the light parts and not the dark parts of the image. I see now that you need it the other way around. To fix that you need to use this image with black features on a white background: http://imgur.com/VZMdpvp and add one line in the pushbutton2_Callback (see it right before the delete call): function pushbutton2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) % hObject handle to pushbutton2 (see GCBO) % eventdata reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB % handles structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA) % first i get values of the sliders r=get(handles.Slider_red,'value'); g=get(handles.Slider_green,'value'); b=get(handles.Slider_blue,'value'); % second setting pb color % by setting the value of backgroundcolor it a vector = [ red green blue] % the allowable value betwwen 0 and 1 imgData = double(handles.a); rgbVect = [r, g, b]; img_rgb = reshape(imgData(:)*rgbVect, [size(imgData, 1), size(imgData,2), 3]); img_rgb(repmat(imgData == min(imgData(:)), [1, 1, 3])) = 255; delete(get(handles.axes2, 'Children')); imshow(uint8(img_rgb), 'Parent', handles.axes2); That will change the black parts of the original image to the color set by the slider. 
Use ./ instead of / for the same reason you use .^ instead of ^
oh oops, I keep forgetting that lol Thanks
Using this input image: http://imgur.com/VZMdpvp I get this output in the GUI: http://imgur.com/p3fOqRN Once the sliders are set and the button pressed, the background is white and the black lines are the color set by the sliders. 
You are correct: T06(1,4) = X T06(2,4) = Y T06(3,4) = Z The other 3 things you have to solve for is the rotation of the end-effector. Check here for the typical roll, pitch, yaw formulation (Eq. 3.42): http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node102.html This matrix corresponds to your T06(1:3,1:3): In order to solve to find your theta angles, you could make use of the solve() command. I haven't used it in a while, but it should be able to get you the results you want. 
plotting circles? Make a vector that describes the points in a circle or the points in your grid. you can use modifiers to the plot() function to change how it plots data, it can plot data points as circles. just type help plot into the command line and matlab will tell you how. 
If you have a 4x4 matrix and 6 unkowns the best you can do is define 4 unknowns in terms of the 2 remaining unknowns. If you are looking for a particular solution you can generate vectors in matlab with various values of these unknowns and then search for the one closes to the answer you are looking for. You can use a numerical method if you like. Like for example the Newton Raphson method that is usually used to solve nonlinear equations that don't have an algebraic solution. This is a common issue in engineering applications. Numerical methods are a great tool. 
But this isn't where the program crashes. Perhaps I do need this, but I am having trouble multiplying by the rotational matrix before this, I can't actually get far enough when running the code for this part to have issues
Thank you very much for your answer :)
No problem :) I make all of my figures for publication with Matlab. Some of my colleagues have even designed their own color palettes. It's really fun stuff. Good luck with your work.
That image works for me... but if i edit that in paint or make another one in photoshop it does what i said like this one... [http://imgur.com/N8ehZ6s](http://imgur.com/N8ehZ6s) i get this [http://imgur.com/8V4uwK7](http://imgur.com/8V4uwK7) 
If the image files in the current folder are exactly those with, say, a .png extension, then you can get a list (as a struct array) and count of all of the files with: files = dir('*.png'); num_files = numel(files); Then if you want to select an image at random, use randi(): filename = files(randi(num_files)).name; image = imread(filename); But repeated selections may not be distinct using this method. If you want to guarantee that no image is ever used twice, use randperm(): image_order = randperm(num_files); for k = image_order filename = files(k).name; image = imread(filename); end 
You could also remove processed file names, or if not remove, make a flag that is 0 if unused and 1 if used. 
Tbh I just wanted you to do the dimension-counting :) Nvm, good you fixed your problem.
The file(s) you are trying to open need to be in the current working directory (if just specified by name, example.txt) or you need to explicitly point to them when your call: fpath = '/user/path/to/files/within/this/folder/'; fname = 'example.txt'; data = load([fpath fname]); In your script your error is because you're looking to load a file from the current working directory that doesn't exist there, or you've mistyped its file name.
Do you have a good and in-depth resource for pub-quality figures?
I like your method of helping - we need more here who help posters *learn* something, not just get to the final answer (not acusing FatTomIV here). Cheers.
No, ode45 does the job for any number of dimensions (actually states).
i changed folder directory's i guess but now this shows up, still dont know if done right... http://puu.sh/cDtif/1975dee6a3.png or should i just use the data = .. as you said above, will try that maybe edit: so i did how you showed me i guess now its saying this: http://puu.sh/cDui9/00f3257ae9.png
So in your first screen, you're trying to call one of your previous versions of your .m script. In the second one, any strings you want in MATLAB have to be surrounded by single quotes (as in my example above). So both your path and file names need to be single quoted to make them strings. Finally, you don't have any extention on your file name in this screen, and it appears again that your calling one of your previous versions of your script and not a data file (unless you've renamed the data file yourself).
I forget how to change the view but lookup getframe() and movie()
You can use rotate() or view(). The first will maintain a constant camera point of view and rotate the object in the middle; the second will be as if you're flying around in a blimp panning around the object.
The names as strings look ok now, but your fpath is still incomplete (and hint, there's a way to get that in your command window right there in front of you...). Are you sure that 'opdracht1.m' is your data file? In your OP you're file's name is something like 'ACE-xxxx.mat'. *There's a bit more, and allow me to edit...* I was too quick to think - you're file path seems right but the error you're getting has to do with the type of data MATLAB is expecting to be loaded and the data in your file that it's trying to pass to be loaded. I still think you've mixed up your file name that you've used in your OP.
So there's something more complicated going on. With a GIF image, the values in the image don't directly relate to a color value like you'd expect. Instead they go through a colormap which is part of the .gif file. To get an image to look the same in both MATLAB and in, say, Paint or Photoshop, you have to take this into account. With the image I gave the colormap goes from black -&gt; white with increasing index values. With the one you gave, it goes from white -&gt; black. This is taken into account in the loading function by checking if the image is a gif, and if so, seeing if the index values need to get inverted by checking the lowest value of the colormap. Also, you have .jpg files able to be loaded. Unlike .gifs, these are going to be three-dimensional matrices (gifs are always 1d). To handle that there's a bit of a hack where the data is converted to a grayscale and only the first slice is taken as the grayscale image for display. Changing Untitled_2_Callback to this: function Untitled_2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) %global a; [archivo, ruta]=uigetfile({'*.gif';'*.jpg'},'abrir imagen'); if isequal(archivo,0)%si el usuario no eleige ningun archivo return else imgInfo = imfinfo(strcat(ruta,archivo)); handles.a=imread(strcat(ruta,archivo)); if strcmp(imgInfo.Format, 'GIF') if (imgInfo.ColorTable(end) == 1) handles.a = max(handles.a(:)) - handles.a; end elseif strcmp(imgInfo.Format, 'jpg') handles.a = rgb2gray(handles.a); handles.a = handles.a(:,:,1); end axis(handles.axes2); imshow(handles.a); guidata(gcbf, handles); msgbox('Se abrio con exito','mensaje'); end And pushbutton2_Callback as this: function pushbutton2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) % hObject handle to pushbutton2 (see GCBO) % eventdata reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB % handles structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA) % first i get values of the sliders r=get(handles.Slider_red,'value'); g=get(handles.Slider_green,'value'); b=get(handles.Slider_blue,'value'); % second setting pb color % by setting the value of backgroundcolor it a vector = [ red green blue] % the allowable value betwwen 0 and 1 imgData = double(handles.a); imgData = max(imgData(:)) - imgData; % Invert image so black -&gt; white, white -&gt; black rgbVect = 1 - ([r, g, b]); % Use inverted values from sliders img_rgb = reshape(imgData(:)*rgbVect, [size(imgData, 1), size(imgData,2), 3]); % Add color to all non-black pixels img_rgb = 255 - img_rgb; % Invert image back to normal delete(get(handles.axes2, 'Children')); % Clear everything from image axes imshow(uint8(img_rgb), 'Parent', handles.axes2); Works for the image I gave, the one you gave, and my image saved as a .jpg. 
http://imgur.com/CaA48jG it draws 2 lines for me
You can do this by addressing the rows of the original matrix with a vector of indices in the order that you want the rows of the new matrix to be in. x = [1 2 3; 2 4 6; 3 6 9]; y = x([2 1 3], :); disp(y) &gt;&gt; 2 4 6 1 2 3 3 6 9
I mean, if you're a quick typist, you may be able to finish within a hundred-thousand years. I'm trying to understand what you're trying to accomplish. So you have 15 rows, and depending on the order of the rows, whatever computation you put the matrix through will give a different output? So you're trying to maximize/minimize this output value and find what order of rows gives you that value?
Here is my matrix A=[8 1 7 45 7 41 8 6 1 8 25 13 27 12 8 1 5 36 7 31 10 4 2 10 49 6 37 9 9 1 5 33 13 27 13 7 2 7 25 11 36 11 4 1 8 36 15 29 11 12 2 9 25 9 22 8 13 2 11 32 13 25 12 5 2 10 48 7 34 9 10 2 10 28 6 37 8 12 2 5 27 12 22 8 9 2 8 30 10 35 13 6 1 11 46 16 28 13 15 1 9 34 8 37 8] Each row is a different job order and each column is the time it will take that order to go through each station. My goal is to find the minimum time it will take to get all the jobs completed. The formula for this is for the first row the time to complete job 1 station 1 is 8 min and job 1 station 2 is 9 min (station 1 + station 2) and continues until job 1 is complete. job 2 can start as soon as job 1 is done with station 1 so the completion time for job 2 station 1 is 14 min (job 1 station 1 + job 2 station 1) and this is the same for all jobs at station 1. the rest of the stations are the sum of the max completion time between the previous job at the station and the current jobs previous station plus the time to complete that station so job 2 station 2 will be 15 min. job 1 finishes station 2 at 9 min and job 2 finishes station 1 at 14 minutes and then 1 minute to complete station 2. sorry if this is hard to understand, I don't have this part typed up yet in matlab
Going somewhat off of what /u/Staus said: You can use the perms function here A = [1 2; 3 4]; B = 1:2; C = perms(B); D = A(C(1, :), :); E = A(C(2, :), :); So in this 2 row example, D and E are the different permutations. For you, you'll just have to iterate through 15! different cases. Not sure if there's a way to vectorize it but you could easily do it with a for loop. 
Ok, I still don't think I understand the problem but I think my other post has what you need to know.
Honestly I don't know. Finding the minimum value is just for extra credit in class and i was able to find a value that was lower than last years solution so I'm not to worried about it anymore. I may still try to mess around with it for fun but knowing that its 2TB just for that matrix i'm not sure anymore lol
This doesn't look like something that matlab can do just by reordering some matrices. This calls for some sort of iterative optimization/scheduling algorithm that could then be implemented. It might exist as a build in. Try to figure out what kind of job scheduling algorithms are out there that apply to your problem. Edit: does what Wikipedia tells you about "flow shop scheduling" and "job shop scheduling" apply to your problem?
There are many ways to do this. Here's a very naive way to do it: X=[-3,0,5]; Y=[6,-1,8]; xx = min(X):max(X); % Regularly spaced vector for the range of X yy = zeros(size(xx)); % Pre-allocate yy with zeros of the same size as xx yy(X-min(X)+1) = Y; % Replace respective x coords with y values plot(xx,yy) % uhh, yeah
The file is a file me and my mate worked on at school however he edited much stuff. Now i wanted it to run on my own pc however i nog yet had Any file/document on my pc. So i guess its like trying to input data. Thats why i asked is it usefull to me at all or is the current file just An edited version of that loades data. I am talking to this guy soon so i can discuss further with him. Also what is the difference between .m and .mat
What do you mean? I'm a self-taught Matlabber. I have 7 years of experience. So I guess I'm a good and in-depth resource. But, to answer your question, I suppose what really helps to make your plots look good is to use the handle graphics for all their worth. You can set the color of your lines to any RGB you want. You can adjust your axes/labels/titles by font, size, color, etc. As a starter they set(gca) and get(gca) commands are super helpful. Note that you can get any figure/axis handle by declaring your plot. For example, you could just plot(x,y), then you would use gca. Or you could use: h=plot(x,y) and then set(h). You can also do this for many subfunctions within a plot, like m=line([x1 x2],[y1 y2]), set(m). I like using set(handle) because it shows you all of the available options you can use to adjust your plot along with the current default. You can also try [Matlab central](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) (it's like a stack exchange/wiki) and search for [handle graphics](http://www.mathworks.com/searchresults/?search_submit=matlabcentral&amp;query=handle+graphics&amp;q=handle+graphics&amp;c[]=matlabcentral). Also, the matlab documentation is fairly decent. Good luck and have fun. Also, I recommend [Tufte's books](http://books.google.ca/books/about/Beautiful_Evidence.html?id=v302PAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) for creating nice plots. 
Thanks heaps :)
I guess I'm looking for something that's more indepth than the typical plot(x,y,'--k') syntax that you'll see in intro books. In the last 2 or so years I've really been interested in exploring more of what MATLAB has to offer in terms of plotting customization. I've just started to scratch the set/get commands. Last night I spent some time looking through some of the online docu - I wish there was a more concise way to get at exactly your question and not have to link through 4 articles. I mean, the info is all out there, I guess I'm just hoping there is a more "put together" version of it? One example, let's say I've got a plot of spectral radiances for 3 different atmospheres and each atmosphere's T, p, and humidity profiles. What I'd like to see is 4 subplots, the top half of the figure is the spectral radiance 3 plots (nice with unique line sytles/colors, which I can do) and in the bottom half I want divided into 3 plots so I can plot each 3 profile of one variable. I don't know how to play with subplot() to get it out of its default functionality of dividing the sub-spaces evenly. Another example would be making one colorbar along the right or bottom of a figure of 4 seasonal subplots of a countour field (say temperature). I've tried to approach this problem in the past, and got *something* that could work, but I would have to go back and revisit it.
.m files are scripts (simply just commands, calls to functions) as well as functions (take input, give output, variables are unique to that function (most times)), .mat files are how MATLAB can store some data that was in the workspace. This is why I kept asking you if you were sure you knew what file you were trying to use. You might try asking your friend, not only is he the one who "made" your data file that you're trying to input, but they can probably offer a bit better help than us here as we're not in person and won't be using your native language to convey concepts in.
A little bit of googling gives this [document](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/50782/ur_kin_tech_report_1.pdf?sequence=1) that may answer your problem. 
Just use the function upsample(). This is exactly what it does. 
What is the data (really, types of) that you are asking a person to input from your prompt_person function? Are they different data types? A struct with string, double, double or string, double, string, or any combination of different data types (or lengths of strings) will throw this wrench trying to make a struct a vector. You could try making it a cell array, I'm not sure if that will help you with your problem..
I always learn cool obscure functions from the users here that I would otherwise not stumble on myself. TIL upsample(), thanks.
In the prompt function, the user input is both string and numbers. The structure that the data input is sent to consists of the fields 'name', 'dateofbirth' (which again is a struct consisting of the fields 'day','month','year') and 'phone'. I see now that the book I'm using recommends, like you suggest, using cell arrays rather than structs when the values are of different types, and/or are supposed be vectorized. Let's see if this helps. Thanks!
His title is misleading. This has nothing to do with upsampling.
&gt; the user input is both string and numbers there is likely your issue. Vectors are all of one data type and, if a vector of strings, all the same length (try the below). willerror = ['play'; 'day']; willwork = ['play'; 'date']; I think the best bet is to use cells rather than vectors. There is a method to get from a structure to cell using [cellfun()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cellfun.html), I had a [question *kind of* similar to your's](http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/2go6jq/trying_to_get_yyyymm_data_out_of_a_list_of_files/ckl12pn) about a month ago, trying to get information from a structure into a variable that was easier to manipulate for my application.
I do not knowhow exactly do that with Matlab but you can do that easily in OpenCV. Just understand structure of IplImage type. And than extract using pointer in c/c++. If that's what you want, I can help you more.
Did you forget to post something? Like your question?
A color theme? A sound theme? This request is meaningless. You need to actually provide an explanation of what you're looking for.
Do you want to generate the waveform? Load the sound file and play it? Why is this like pulling teeth?
What kind of class is this? Sure sounds like a dynamic programming problem to me. The states (busy/free) are even discrete (binary), and the action set is also (which order to take next) discrete (at each stage is it just a list of the remaining orders). The problem is not trivial, but by solving it from the back, you only have to carry the continuation value around, not all the actions. You'd have to think a bit further about how to take care of the queues, but I think it could be calculated a lot(!) faster than just comparing all the different orderings.
&gt; Hi, &gt; &gt; I'm trying to do a minimap GUI, like the one here[1] on page 25. The thing I don't know is how to plat a point on an axes object. It is an axes object right? I'm fairly new to this GUI thing. Thank you _______ I downloaded the pdf (don't surprise people like that), went scrolled to page 25. Couldn't find what you were talking about at a quick glance. Be more descriptive in the question itself, please. This is not the way to seek help online. You can plot a point on an axis object by using lots of ways. The one that gives you the most control is using a line object. Read the documentation or GUI tutorials in the documentation. Or, search online for tutorials like [this](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~gerry/MATLAB/plotting/plotting.html) for example.
 figure; ax1=axes('position',[0 0 1 1],'box','on'); ax2=axes('position',[.05 .05 .2 .2],'box','on'); x=linspace(0,1,1e2); y=x.^2; plot(ax1,x,y,'b'); plot(ax2,x,y,'r'); FYI trying to download the PDF but it's taking forever, so not sure if this is even what you want. I'll update if I found out it's not.
Are you just looking to input multivariate polynomials? Or any math function (exp/log and trig) in general? Do you know how many independent variables?
&gt;the 5 different types of images There are only 5 different types of images? Reshape does what it sounds like - it reshapes a matrix. In that line, the idea is to convert the M x N 2D image matrix to a M\*N x 1 1D vector, multiply that by another 1 x 3 1D vector representing the colormap, resulting in a M\*N x 3 2D matrix. Then use reshape() to convert that to a M x N x 3 3D matrix of the right size for displaying the image. You could get the same result by using repmat() to repeat the colormap vector in the M and N dimensions into a M x N x 3 matrix, then using element-wise multiplication of that on a M x N x 3 repeat of the 2D image data (again using repmat(), but along the 3rd dimension) but matrix multiplication + reshape() is faster. Graphics objects in MATLAB are nested. For example, axes are often children of figures, which makes the figure the parent of the axes. We can use the handle of an object directly to address it, or we can find that handle by looking at the 'Parent' or 'Children' property of the child or parent object, respectively. Since you record the handle for the axes but not the image itself in the handles structure, the code looks in the 'Children' property of the axes to find the handle of the image, which is a child of the axes, and then deletes that. A gif stores image information as an array of values that do not correspond to colors on their own, but rather refer to values in a colormap or look-up table that is part of the .gif format. In one image that I had and one that you had we actually had images that looked the same (black objects on white background) but the colormaps were opposite. That means that if we looked only at the values in the image matrix they would be opposite of one another (black was a high value in my image but a low value in yours). To correct for this the information in the colormap was needed, which is what the extra 'if' statement is for in the GIF format case. The code in that section will only work in the specific case of B+W or grayscale images, but in this case it works. More elegant solutions certainly exist and are probably already built into MATLAB. 
Look up function handles. That's how you handle functions as an input. 
Way better than the loop I was trying, thanks!
You'll probably have to write something custom.
Eehm, I don't see any weird errors in there... The only comment I would have is that your output "vals" returns a bunch of 1ns (since you are looking through the results of a bunch of logic statements). So that's not really usefull. Have you tried all the logic statements seperately? And see what the result is from that? So just: a=sector_xy(1,2) &lt; xy(:,1); b=xy(:,1) &lt; sector_xy(2,2); c=sector_xy(1,3) &lt; xy(:,2); d=xy(:,2) &lt; sector_xy(2,3); With this you can manually check if there actually values within the given range. On you question "Is there a better way to do this?" it depends on what you want to do. If you only want the row and column values then this is an excellent way to achieve this. But if you are only interested in the actual coordinates then there might be some easier ways since you can use the output of your logic statments as an index: index=sector_xy(1,2) &lt; xy(:,1) &amp; ... xy(:,1) &lt; sector_xy(2,2) &amp; ... sector_xy(1,3) &lt; xy(:,2) &amp; ... xy(:,2) &lt; sector_xy(2,3); %A column vector indicating which rows correspond with your desired range. xy_selection=xy(index,:); %only save the rows as indicated by "index" and both columns (x and y coordinates). But that is assuming that your logical indexes return something... Sorry I can't be of any more help! (If it still doesn't work, maybe you can share your actual data?).
Alternatively, is there a way to save an output answer as a new variable? Obviously running A(8)=7 results in my desired matrix, can i save this result directly as variable A2?
i played around with ans, and had no luck, directly after executing A(8)=7 i tried A2 = ans and got back Attempt to execute SCRIPT ans as a function: /Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app/toolbox/matlab/lang/ans.m I've noticed that ans is sometimes stored in the workspace, but it isn't when i do this, could that be why A2 = ans isn't working? Is there a way to automatically save ans as a variable? when i try A2 = A A2(8) = 7 i get A2 = A A2(8) = 7 | Error: Unexpected MATLAB expression. 
To clarify, are you doing this in a script/function, or just in your workspace? This seems to be very much working on my end: http://i.imgur.com/TD4KxvI.png
As a sidenote now that you have a solution to your problem, I'd recommend not [overloading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading#Complications) `ans` with a file named ans.m
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; Section 3. [**Complications**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading#Complications) of article [**Function overloading**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function%20overloading): [](#sfw) --- &gt; &gt;Two issues complicate function overloading: [name masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_masking) (due to [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science\))) and [implicit type conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_type_conversion). &gt;If a function is declared in one scope, and then another function with the same name is declared in an inner scope, there are two natural possible overloading behaviors: the inner declaration masks the outer declaration (regardless of signature), or both the inner declaration and the outer declaration are both included in the overload, with the inner declaration masking the outer declaration only if the signature matches. The first is taken in C++: "in C++, there is no overloading across scopes." As a result, to obtain an overload set with functions declared in different scopes, one needs to explicitly import the functions from the outer scope into the inner scope, using the using keyword &gt;Implicit type conversion complicates function overloading because if the types of arguments do not exactly match the signature of one of the overloaded functions, but can match after type conversion, resolution depends on which type conversion is chosen. &gt; --- ^Interesting: [^Polymorphism ^\(computer ^science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_\(computer_science\)) ^| [^C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) ^| [^Subroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clumsld) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clumsld)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
dlmread, textscan, xlsread, fgetl, fread, fscanf are all various methods to input data to MATLAB. Is your data regular? From your OP it doesn't appear that way as the number of elements in each row is different. Also what timestamp? Is that your first column?
% The following code will iterate 1000 times. % Create a new script and copy and paste the code below into it. Then save it and run it. % the percentage symbol comments out code z = 1 % type in your own constant for n = 1:1000 x = y(x)/z end 
This won't necessarilly execute until you have some small differenct (y is negligbally small) - what happens when you're acceptably small occurs after the 5000th iteration? You'll need a while loop for that and a threshold condition to check if you should still iterate or not: while curdif &gt; thresh % do your fun stuff % calculate and update curdif for the current iteration end
Your first two points are right, you'll be building up busses on the outside to match the signals inside the subsystems. It's a bummer, but fortunately you only need to do this setup once then just replace the subsystem as updates come in. When designing the test you want to supply realistic test cases that go beyond the typical design point. For example, a flight control system may have logic to prevent stall, you would want to provide inputs that really test whether or not that gets triggered based on your knowledge of the system. In the future, when updates are made, you'll drop the subsystem into the harness you already built, rerun the tests (maybe add new ones) and make sure everything still passes. You may add tests for failure scenarios, off-nominal conditions, nominal conditions etc. Each one of these would change the inputs to the system, but use the same harness.
Yeah, this is a valid approach. Thanks for the answer. I was hoping for something prettier, though; I can understand if it doesn't exist within the Matlab framework. 
To add to what the other guy is telling you: My method works for an arbitrarily large number of iterations.
Thank you for the help! This morning I commented out each logic statement and introduced them back in one at a time. Strangely, despite not rewriting any code, it works now! 
Are you familiar with any numerical methods? What you are describing is similar to the Newton Raphson, Gauss-Siedal Method for solving linear systems or successive substitution for non linear equations. Look up those process and this will help you out.
This is why I absolutely hate busses. You should be able to cleanly wire your diagram if you take the time to do it.
In Octave you can do the obvious thing: inv(A)(i,j). Matlab is not able to do this, at least up until 2013a or so.
No.
With a visual tool like simulink a picture speaks a thousand words. 
Adding to this, if the user is using an OS that is not Windows, she or he could take advantage of some *nix utilities to avoid using matlab to scan through the file. For example, if it's already known what the data types are, you could do something like [s c] = unix('cat myfile.txt | grep ACC | sed &lt;insert appropriate regexp here&gt;') to get the time stamps for every event type. This way you don't have to deal with opening a file in matlab and scanning through it, which can be very slow, ugly, and potentially buggy. If you don't already know what the data types are, you can use the same command to build up a list of data types, store the unique ones, then use unix() to get the respective time stamps. 
There is a more elegant solution if you're not using windows. See my response to the above post. 
Are you using the wrong filename? You have a ".jpq" instead of ".jpg" in your error message, and again in this comment.
wow i cant believe i did that Apologies, it's been a long night/day, was just copy and pasting it to save time, haha and i've spent so much time trying to figure it out
Okay thank you!
Matlab has some built in user interfaces/dialog boxes that can be useful for straight forward application. A list of them are available in the sidebar here: http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/ref/questdlg.html Depending on whether or not you want to A) allow the user to pick and choose what to plot or B) plot them all or a a predefined selection, a possible solution for the latter could be. plot_or_not = questdlg('Display on Output?','Display Options') if strcmp(plot_or_not,'Yes') % some plotting functions end 
I have no idea, but I see the same trend in other "professional" subreddits as well. Legitimate, topical questions get down voted, and then others bitch and complain why there is so little traffic. Then, god forbid, you have a discussion that is kind of on-topic (but not a popular opinion), you get banned. People once in a while post the question of what will eventually doom Reddit, and invariably its going to be BS like this.
The same with mine. So it's not affected my viewing, I was just wondering if the people behind it would like to give any reason behind it. I'm genuinely curious if it's some disgruntled NumPy user or something.
I'm thinking of starting to just answer StackExchange questions and hope they get an engineering subreddit as well.
+1 Point Octave. Remind me what production devices use Octave instead of Simulink? +"a lot" Mathworks. http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/ 
I have a handful of these tools. Anytime you find yourself doing something more than once, make it a function. It's easier to debug, once you have it debugged (like the above function) you never have to worry about it again. I would even go above and beyond and set up some defaults so that you could get by with a shorter call. function Aij = inv_ij(A,i,j) % inv_ij - Return the (i,j) element of the inverse of A % % Usage: Aij = inv_ij(A,i,j); % Aij = inv_ij(A); % Returns A^-1(1,1). % See Also inv if nargin&lt;3 j=1; end if nargin&lt;2 i=1; end A = inv(A); Aij = A(i,j); 
Sorry, I didn't realize this was an argument...
 err=1 while err&gt;(some tiny number) math err=abs(y(new)-y(old)) end When the change in y is negligible it'll stop. 
Yea, except for the part where I explicitly, directly answered OP's question, referencing Matlab by name.
&gt; In Octave you can do the obvious thing: inv(A)(i,j). You contributed nothing to the conversation. No one cares what Octave can do.
You seem like a very angry person, good luck with your life.
You seem to be lost. This is /r/matlab. Not /r/octave.
I KNEW it.
I used to. Simulink every day... While the harness might need to be modified, it should be smaller and smaller changes over time. If you need to add/remove a few signals its nbd. You could write a script that does all this for you. However, depending on how much work there is it may make more sense to do it manually. I've scripted out stuff like this before it's not exactly easy. Propagation is normal. If you don't need to worry about the integrity of your signal then don't use buses. Buses help enforce naming and datatype conventions as well as standards that end up in the generated code. They also help organize the model. Without buses you could change signal names and datatypes anywhere and a typo could come back to cause major problems. 
My last post on this actually got upvoted. Things have gotten worse! 
That's my concern is in rigid enforcement of interfaces. If names are changed like that, it makes using busses very untenable. 
[Input Dialog Box](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inputdlg.html)
If you're generating code naming is typically very important for integration into other code bases or hardware platforms. The engineers giving you the systems for test should have to adhere to some guidelines. If they're not you could always just say send it back and say 'it keeps failing my tests because of the name change'
Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're asking is: "How do I solve the system of simultaneous equations: &gt;1000 = 1000x; &gt;0 = 0; &gt;2000 = 5000z; using Matlab's vector formalism?" If that's the case, have a look at the information presented [here](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/symbolic/solve.html?nocookie=true).
 syms x z Vm1 = [1000; 0; 2000]; Vm2 = [2000*x; 0; 5000*z]; [x,z]=solve(Vm1==Vm2,'x','z')
Thank you, that does help. I was thinking along those lines myself, however, the tutorial that I was required to read prior, doesn't mention much about that or seem related at all. I guess it would be related when checking if the answer is correct though. Also, the vectors they give me are in row and not column form, which confused me for constructing matrix A (making me think it was incorrect to do). I was also given eigenvalues, which I guess were just to check my answer? What really makes this question hard then is that the majority of the information given is to check your answer, not to achieve it. Just to clarify. I write my given vectors as columns in a matrix (A), take the inverse of A, then multiply the inverse of A by the column vector of my solutions (b)?
Actually, usually when someone writes (1,2,1) for a vector they mean the column vector [1;2;1]. 9 times out of 10 that's what a mathematician is trying to say. So the equation: c1(1,2,1)+c2(1,0,-1)+c3(1,-2,1)=(0.22,0.11,0.67) might better be viewed as: c1[1;2;1]+c2[1;0;-1]+c3[1;-2;1]=[0.22;0.11;0.67]. But even if that's not what is meant by that, the equation is nonetheless the same Ax=b linear system. Yeah basically first you should run the code given. Then you'll want to set A=[x1 x2 x3]; and then compute either inv(A) * v0 (if you really like the form Ax=b you can also set b=v0; and then compute inv(A) * b, but it really doesn't matter.)
Something we have been doing in classes has had row-vectors (vector space introductory stuff I think) so it confused me. How would I form the matrix from the given vectors since the code it gives me doesn't seem to do that.
So, c1(1,2,1)+c2(1,0,-1)+c3(1,-2,1)=(0.22,0.11,0.67) is the same as: c1+c2+c3=0.22, 2c1+0c2-2c3=0.11 and c1-c2+c3=0.67. In matrix form it's [1 1 1;2 0 -2;1 -1 1] * [c1;c2;c3] = [0.22;0.11;0.67]. But the matrix, [1 1 1;2 0 -2;1 -1 1] is just [x1 x2 x3]. It really doesn't matter if the system is written as row vectors or column vectors. Either way you get back to: [1 1 1;2 0 -2;1 -1 1] * [c1;c2;c3] = [0.22;0.11;0.67] which you need to solve.
Your T has 9 values and your v has 6. What do you expect the output of your calculation to be? Do you expect it to be a matrix with 9 rows and 6 columns? If that's the case, you need to change T into an array that has 6 columns, where each column is exactly the same. TRepeat = repmat(T(:), [1 6]); Then you need to change v into an array that has 9 rows, where each row is exactly the same. vRepeat = repmat(v(:)', [9 1]) Note that I put the apostrophe (transpose) in there. Now TRepeat, and vRepeat are the same size. You should be able to plug them into your formula, use "dot asterisk" for multipication and "dot carrot" for raising to powers (I think you're raising v to the power 16, but I'm not sure because the formatting on reddit is weird.)
What exactly are you expecting to happen? Which of the 9 do you want added to which of the 6?
Alternatively, `[T_rep, V_rep] = meshgrid(T, V)` or `ndgrid` can be used to construct the grids of variables
Guys, I think OP might just want the 54 combinations of T and v and the equations result? If that's the case, OP, you can use two for loops: fn_output = NaN*ones(9,6); for it = 1:9 for iv = 1:6 curv = v_vect(iv); curt = t_vect(it); fn_output(it,iv) = % your eq'n here; use curv and curt scalars for simplicity for now end end This is going to iterate 54 times, use one value for T and one value for v, put them into your equation to solve, then store the value in fn_output at the appropriate index.
The equation you've written is not valid mathematically. That has nothing to do with Matlab. The other advice here is good: there are a bunch of things you might be trying to do, and there are appropriate ways to accomplish those tasks in Matlab. But what you want to do is not specified by that expression, so it's no wonder Matlab doesn't know what to do with it.
Thanks for thorough reply. One more question; I am also using simulink and it needs a compiler for c functions and therefore you need to install visual studio. How about on a mac ?
http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2014b/index.html?sec=maci64
well this is the equation I was given to solve
Can we have you post more here? I subscribed to this forum for info like this, but all I ever see are questions for homework help.
I ended up having two installation of Matlab on my mac, the 'nix install and a windows install on bootcamp accessed via parallels. I'm having to use HDL Coder and the Xilinx toolsets don't support mac.
As far as linear algebra goes, it's completely invalid and impossible to solve. Sorry. Vectors of different lengths cannot be added, and they can't be multiplied except by special operations. What does the equation represent? Knowing that would help us to understand what you need from Matlab.
... with the TL;DR of that being that yes, you can just download XCode from the App Store and you're good to go. It'll take up a few GB of space on your drive (which is probably comparable to Visual Studio and not a big deal for most people... though space is starting to get tight on my 128GB MacBook Air), but it's free of charge and easy to install.
Yeah, I've had similar thoughts about /r/matlab... seems like a lot of the time it is more like /r/matlabhelp. I think it would be cool if the community was a little more active at making non-help-related posts too, but I'm not sure what that would be, exactly... I use Matlab constantly but it's pretty rare that I go, "Oooh, I just found something that would be perfect for /r/matlab!" Definitely worth further discussion, though...
I thought that when I read a good Cleve's Corner on the fft, once. I think I posted it but was in the shadows of "Help me with this loop." The mods should definitely think about creating a /r/matlabhelp subreddit. Similar to how /r/usmc was being overrun with boot camp related questions so /r/usmcboot was created and most users are very good at enforcing it, since they don't want to read the same questions every month.
THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
To add to things that have already be said, you'll be fine with an i5 or better and at least 4GB RAM. Unless you're doing really long cpu-intensive calculations you don't really need an amazing processor (multi-cores can be helpful thought). The amount of RAM you have will dictate the maximum size of matrices you can create, but again, unless you're doing anything crazy you should be fine. In terms of mac computability, the only issues are that you need X11 installed (which can be funny at times).
 vec_old = [1 2 3 4 5]; vec_new = vec_old(end:-1:1);
This is over combersome, and you don't even need for loops or any other variables (you could use one extra if you wanted to preserve the input): a = [1 2 3 4 5]; % whatever input a = a(end:-1:1); I understand what you've put forth is likely how the computer does this process internally, and might be the methodology for what I've put, but take advantage of what MATLAB already can do for you! This method will also work for any 1xN column/row vector. Not sure if that dimensionality is preserved in the output; you could just check and modify it afterward if that was crutial.
It is true that you can use the implied loop which is more efficient and much easier. I just assumed that since the post was labeled as "Midterm practice" that the instructor would be more interested in the student's ability to write an algorithm than just use a built-in function. It depends on the context of the class and specific topics covered in the course which were not specified. If it is a matlab-specific course, it may test the student's ability to memorize and correctly utilize the built-in functions, or it may serve the purpose of teaching them basic programming algorithms. I personally feel the exercise of working through the logic of a program is more beneficial in an educational context. Qman485, you can use either to get the same result so use whichever is more relevant to your class.
I'll second what most people have said here, Matlab works great on macs. However, two minor things to be aware of are that xlsread and xlswrite don't have full capability on a mac. It's pretty minor, and I think there's software on the file exchange to get around this, but something to be aware of. The other is the god damned Java heap memory. Matlab places a limit on the amount of memory java can use, and for some reason limits it to a lowly 256 mb on Mac (I believe you can set it to whatever you want on a pc). It's rare that you need a lot of it. I usually only go over when I generate more than 40 complicated plots at a time or occasionally when I've continued a matlab session for months on end (yeah try that on a pc). But anyway these are the only annoyances I've faced, overall I've been completely satisfied with using matlab on a mac.
&gt;"Midterm practice" that the instructor would be more interested in the student's ability to write an algorithm You know, I read that in the title and didn't consider it further - just skipped over that. I appologize for the way my post was worded - you'ver certainly addressed the ?? at hand w the most appropriate answer. And I agree with (the rest of) both your posts. Again, apologies if i came across as confrontational. I've been outside of a numerical methods class for so long and in the mode of quick, short, and robust.
&gt;if the input is in the range, that is greater or equal to a or less then or equal to b, then the function should give the input value that led to the end of the function as output. what the function does though is that it gives the FIRST input whatever that was, as output. Hmm... this is what I think is going on, and think of these levels as dream worlds from Inception (if the concept of recursion is new/unfamiliar). Each time you call your function, the condition must be met as: A is less than B, AND the user input is outside the [A, B] range. Then you call your function again, get another user input, check it, ...... So you'll have something *structured* like: INITIAL(FIRST) function call --&gt; a &gt; b; first input outside of [a,b]; call function SECOND function call --&gt; a &gt; b; second input outside of [a,b]; call function THIRD function call --&gt; a &gt; b; third input outside of [a,b]; call function &lt;.. more recursion until the Nth input is inside of [a,b] ..&gt; ... and then, **BANG**, you want your recursion to stop, and you want the value of the **Nth input** to be returned as the output. The problem I think is occuring is that, while you *are* passing **a** and **b** to each successive child function call, you are not allowing information of the subsequent user inputs to *trickle back upward* to the top of the recusrion chain to the INITIAL(FIRST) parent function call. To get around this, you might be able to add another output to your function, and with some strict accounting be able to have this final **Nth** user input to be passed as the ultimate output. But this seems a bit more complicated than it needs to be... I think the better way to do this type of recursion is with a [*whlle-loop*](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/while.html). It's less complicated and only calls your function once (the initial call) while prompting the user for their input indefinitely until its within [a,b] (you can set a max N of iterations so you don't infinitely loop). **TL;DR:** use a while loop.

I've been using matlab on a late 2013 macbook pro, i5 + 4GB RAM. It works fine and handles most stuff at a very reasonable speed. I've been doing image processing work, even. Some of the heavier lifting on large batches of uncompressed images can take hours, but that's fairly expected. If you plan on doing chunky stuff like that, be prepared to accept some wait time. Everything else it handles just fine. I confess I've not used the windows version. I work for a university lab and we use macs and matlab pretty extensively. Someone did mention the xlsread/xlswrite issues and that's worth noting if you need to export data back out to excel for some reason. I haven't had any trouble with xlsread to import my data, though.
Just curious, how does one send a computation to the background? I have a data fitting algorithm which brings matlab into focus (away from whatever other task I am running) every time it starts a new fitting routine and I would love for this behaviour to end.
Great comments. I took a matlab/computational Methods course two semesters ago and students would get lots of points off if it looked like they used chegg or another "cheater" method on the homework or quizzes. The professor was looking for the application of what he taught in class.
Google around for " how to run matlab in the background" since there are many ways. One example is [this](http://www.stat.osu.edu/computer-support/programming/background-jobs). The ampersand is key! Of course, it's good to make sure there are not plots since either they won't show or it may throw an error. 
I use Matlab heavily for single-threaded simulations. I'd say that the performance between my macbook pro (core i7 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM) and my desktop pc (core i7 2.8GHz, 6GB RAM) is unnoticeable. If you are working with lots of data, buy as much RAM as you can afford. Seriously, I'd recommend nothing short of 16GB if you use Matlab heavily. 
I am currently using Matlab on a Windows, Unix, and a Mac machine. While I mostly perform very large data intensive operations on the Unix machine, the day to day problems scale equally with the three versions. The only issue I have had to date is that I just cannot get mex files to work with XCode 5 on my Mac.
 len = length(vec) for ii = 1:floor(0.5*len) vec([ii len-ii]) = vec([len-ii ii]); end will switch it entry by entry (if that is what's required)
I've done some interpolation of gridded data recently and what I've found is that the x and y vectors of both old and new data sets are really finiky. I think thaht they have to be a row AND a columm vector, not two of each, and they need to match the dims of your old data. Finally, your new interp x and y need to reflect similar behavior just with the dimensions of your new data. I can't remember off hand what the syntax is that I use but I know that I spent about 5 minutes transposing (') vectors/arrays so that I could get my application to work.
Thanks! Yeah, I'm just learning. Noticed this when solving a problem with several different methods gave me the same answers but with different sign for imaginary parts. Apparently in some of them I used ctranspose wrongly.
Yeah, your right. I cleared that up. EqnR1 = real(EQN1); EqnI1 = imag(EQN1); edit: still nothing, it's like the real and imaginary values are still in each equation.
I am not a matlab wiz but I know math. What are you solving for? Why are you using degrees and not radians?
You can use dirac(x), dirac(x-1), etc..., to produce your vector.
I'm solving for theta4 and r3... which I forgot to include on this... I'll correct it. you are right I should be using radians... ugh. I suck.
As a poster below me noted, make sure your angle units are correct,but that won't cause it to fail. I'm not familiar with the toolbox, but "solve" is from the symbolic math toolbox and requires special data types you're not using. The best thing in standard MATLAB would be fzero. You need to arrange your equation to be equal to zero for the correct value of theta4, and use function handles where appropriate.
ok, I haven't used fzero or function handles before. I'll give it a shot. EQN1 is solved for zero.
Extend A to a 3x3 matrix and b to a 3x1 vector such that the last element of x is forced to one.
&gt; the notes my professor gave me won't open on my laptop What kind of file are they? As far as the problem goes, where are you stuck? You seem to understand the problem well. Are you familiar with [for](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html) and/or [while](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/while.html) loops in MATLAB? The links have examples. [This page](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/matlab/control.html) seems like a decent introduction to them, as well.
What have you tried so far?
This is what it looks like so far, I have deleted and restarted the problem several times however, so what I have now is the beginning of the problem.(Also, I added format long because my teacher mentioned it in the assignment, but I don't know what it does honestly.) % ENGR 1315-014 % November 6, 2014 % Homework 16 Part A % Write a MATLAB program incorporating a while loop to build the Fibonacci sequence and to % approximate the Golden Ratio. Store the approximated ratios in the form of a column or row % matrix and keep executing the loop until the magnitude of the difference of the newly computed % ratio and the preceding computed ratio is less than % . Mathematically speaking, set the loop % to keep reiterating until the difference in the actual and calculated % ratios is less than 10^-8 clear clc format long GR=1.61803398875; fib=zeros(30,1); fib(1)=1; fib(2)=1; n=3; i=0; while i&lt;=30 fib(n)=fib(n-2)+fib(n-1); n=n+1; i=i+1; end edit: I looked up what format long means, so I'm good on that.
for and while loops seem pretty simple to me, which is why I don't know why I am having such trouble with this problem. I think my problem is that I don't know how to do calculations to an array; I don't know how to get it to take each term in the Fibonacci sequence and calculate the difference until it reaches a certain point.
&gt;What kind of file are they? it's an example in excel, however, when I try to view them, I am told that I need Office to open them. But the example he made in class on how to solve this problem hasn't been posted yet, and he just sent an email saying he would be out of town and wouldn't answer emails...
You could use [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) or [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) to open it, if that helps.
I added this: while ((fib(n,1)/fib(n-1,1))-(GR))&lt;(10^-8); n=n+1; end this is the part that gives me an error.
So one thing I want to point out is that in MATLAB, everything is a matrix, not an array. I don't mean to criticize, but in some cases, it's a big deal. Plus, the name comes from MATrix LABoratory. Doing math on a matrix is just like on other variables. You can add or subtract two matrices of the same dimensions (same number rows and columns) like a + b or a - b. If you want to do something to just one or two elements in the matrix, you can access them by saying matrixName(rowNumber, columnNumber). So if your matrix is called fibonacciNumbers, you can find the first one by saying fibonacciNumbers(1, 1) --&gt; that's the element in the first row, first column.
I looked at the files again, they aren't the files that I needed.
What's the error? Can you copy+paste it here?
Sweet! Nicely done. I can't believe I haven't mentioned how much I enjoy the Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio. I just ran your code in MATLAB. So cool.
I made some mistakes( the script went on forever for example, oops!), but I fixed them, and I'll put on the finishing touches tomorrow. Thank you so much! And all the frustration aside, I actually really enjoy making scripts, I'm learning so much!
I figured it out, but thank you for replying, I appreciate the help! (Edit:there was a lot wrong with it, haha!)
maybe a couple screenshots?
Make the third row of A be [0, 0, 1] and give b a third component of 1. This forces x(3) = 1.
Oh yeah. Right. That was way easier than I thought initially. Guess it wasn't really a MATLAB problem, I just should've remembered my linear algebra. Thanks a lot!
I tried to hint you the right direction as this is a /r/cheatatmathhomework or /r/learnmath question and not a Matlab related question. Your problem was understanding of homogeneous coordinates/LinAlg and not Matlab. Bicycle cleared it up anyway, good luck with it
It was, as I realize now. I thought too hard of a way to force a fixed third element with general matrices instead of just doing the math for the problem I have. It's a problem I have more often, that I just don't see the easy way and try too difficult things. Thanks for the hint and help.
First off, you should rename your variable "diff" as there's already a MATLAB function [diff()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/diff.html). Your issue here is more to do with what you *think* you're plotting and less to do with any funny business MATLAB (isn't) doing.
[file_list.m](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22829-file-list/content/file_list.m) I wrote it ages ago (2006) and it's still the core of any batch processing I have to do.
You could declare the variables you want the sub-function to read as global, but you'll have to declare them as global in each of the subfunctions too. I think the better practice is to simply pass the variables to your functions. If you have a lot of variables and it's cumbersome to pass them into a function, you could always group them into a structure then only pass that structure: variables.a = 5; variables.b = 2; variables.name = 'Bob'; somefunction(variables); 
Thanks! :D
Thank you!
For me, the first two items in the 'files' variable are '.' and '..' I'd put in a quick line: files=dir(my_folder); files(1:2) = []; for i=1:length(files.name) .....
There are two basic image types: bitmap and vector: Bitmap images are pixel-by-pixel based. So a plot can only scale so much before it degrades. Examples include `png`, `tiff` and `jpeg`. Also note that jpeg uses some additional compression so that it takes up even less space. But, since a bitmap image must store every pixel, it can actually get rather large. The better format for this kind of thing is vector. In a vector format, the "image" is not really an image as much as a complex set of instructions on making the image. This way, not only is it (usually) smaller, but it can be scaled indefinitely since it's just instructions. The two most common format are `eps` and `pdf` (though note that these are container formats and can also house bitmap images) There is almost never a time when vector isn't the best format to use. However, there are some complex image types that Matlab chokes on for vector-based export (patches with non unity `FaceAlpha` for example). So *vector-based* `eps` and `pdf` are the best with the latter being more portable. There are many ways to export to these formats. `eps` is supported directly in Matlab's `print` command. Take a look at the ever-popular [`export_fig`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) for all other types. One quick way to check if an image is vector based is to keep on zooming in at a line. If it gets jagged, it's bitmap. If it stays smooth, it's vector. Also, the vector ones often maintain the fonts too! **TL/DR**: PDF. But make sure it exports as a vector-based. **ADDENDUM:** I am not sure how the new `R2014b` handles some export. YMMV
For posters/publishing I think PDF is best. PDF produces vectorized images which can be blown up infinitely and never get pixelated. Also they are good for postprocessing in Gimp or Photoshop. EPS is also a vector format but cannot save plot items with transparency (alpha values). For the web, I'd go with SVG, another vector format which can be rendered by browsers. SVG export code here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7401-scalable-vector-graphics--svg--export-of-figures
Just a note about raster formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.): JPG is a lossy format and it terrible for things like plots with hard edges like lines, patches, etc. (JPEG works better for "natural" images of people, trees, etc. with softer edges). If you're going to go with a raster format, use TIFF or PNG for your plots. But as the others said, the vector formats are better for variable sized graphics. I used .eps when writing my dissertation in LaTeX and they printed just fine.
Thanks for your reply. &gt;Also, the vector ones often maintain the fonts too! I think this is what I was ultimately after, making sure the fonts scale nicely and not jagged. Thanks again.
Thanks for the tip RE: making the browser images.
How about this: AllChoices = cellstr(num2str([1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]')) [ChoiceNum,v] = listdlg('ListString', AllChoices) ThisChoice = str2double(AllChoices (ChoiceNum)) 
Thank you very much! 
As most people have mentioned, PDFs are usually the best (eps is good too) if you're doing all of your typesetting in LaTeX. But, sometimes I add other graphics objects to a figure in Visio before exporting to a PDF. If I'm doing this (or going straight to Powerpoint), I use EMF. Office products in Windows play nicer with EMF.
Great advice in this thread. PNG is optimal for raster graphics-- it's best used when you have lots of data points. PDF is fine for line plots or other relatively sparse plots. Play with the options to find what works best for you. 
Right. But OP said &gt;I'm mainly doing x-y line plots and lon/lat gridded contourf() plots. which are *much* better as `eps` or `pdf`.
Take a look at this. CRAZY efficient: http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18937-ipdm--inter-point-distance-matrix
please elaborate. I have limited programming experience and plan to learn once I graduate and can dedicate some real time to it!
Well... what *I* think you're *WANTING* to plot is: plot(x,curve); % with whatever linespecs but what *you're* plotting is: plot(x,y,'-+'); The first value in y is .101 so it comes as no surprise what you see plotted passes through (0, .101) and not through at p2 (0, 1.642). As for naming a variable diff... you generally want to avoid naming variables "names" that are also the name of functions: diff(), plot(), mean(), exp(), find() .. Also, what type of fit are you trying to perform. There are built-in curve-fitting functions..
that curve equation came from the curve fitting tool, which is why I am so confused. (first part of post). Why did the curve fitting tool choose a seperate y intercept I think is what I am asking. as for the diff, thanks, noted.
So your y-values in your post: y=[.101 .338 .573 .809 1.042 1.280 1.515 1.756 1.997 2.233 2.476 2.710 2.967 3.19]; .. those are "experiemental observations" that you are trying to fit an equation to? And you got the p1 and p2 values themselves from some curve fitting method?
One guess as to why the code does not work when you use the "imag" code... The imaginary part of EQN1 depends on the value of "theta4". So maybe Matlab cannot calculate the imaginary part properly. What do you get when you print EqnI1?
I exclusively use the package export_fig.m to produce vector PDFs. These can go straight into Illustrator, and you can have a transparent background (incredibly handy). For figures that have shading and gradients, I'd use a png with a transparent background.
I try to be very open to the idea of being wrong and/or corrected. It's how I learn and, in general, I think more knowledge always trumps ignorance. But then there are the replies that just sound like the author wanted to chime in. Which is why I say: That's **almost** a valid retort. Congratulations, you **almost** contributed positively rather than nit-pick **almost** everything I said. Too bad it was an **almost** useless clarification for an **almost** entirely valid reasoning behind the data type that *is* **almost** always the best to use. I bet you **almost** feel good about your post. 
Im on mobile and the figure doesn't show for me, however if it isn't some super complicated 3d plot and you want to use it in latex afterwards I can always recommend the pgfplots package for latex. Export the matlab data to a text file and customize the plot in latex however you'd like. Takes a while to get used to, so if it's just a single plot you need it might be to much work. Has excellent documentation though
Yes, there are ways to do *ALL THE THINGS!!* Yesterday I [posted about the "best" graphics format to save](http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/2luutb/best_graphics_format_to_save/). I've been working on how to FULLY customize my plots/figures. Take a look at the set() and get() commands as well as gcf and gca. The first two allow you to ask for and set properties of the current figure (gcf) and axis (gca). For a list of all the properties, just google: matlab axes/figure properties and you'll get the docu.
Is it just a command-line app (that takes some input from files, or the standard input), or a full on GUI app?
I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean by "window". You mention the "white space", which I assume you mean the border around the axis. If you want the axis object (where the data is plotted) to look a certain way: ax =get(gcf, 'children'); set(ax(1), 'Position', [x,y,w,h]); And then just play around with your desired inputs for x,y,w,h (relative to the window).
Currently am playing around with it. I guess what I want is to plot something first on a blank "infinite" paper, then crop it down appropriately and not have to manually fudge with [x y w h]
I'd use color for time, and use some sort of difference in geometric shape for stage. Essentially bin the stage data and use like 6 or 7 different shapes triangle square ... something like that. But in all honesty you should think about not using a 3d scatter plot, they are really hard to interpret and with 6 dimensions its just insane. 
I thought he meant color-code data according to time... I agree with your comment about not using scatter3 - this might look quite jumbled, OP.
I sincerely hope you didn't get too angry about that. Have a nice day. 
I took it to mean that he was using a 3d scatter plot, and using size to highlight amplitude and colour to indicate stage, but was trying to think of a way to include the 6th dimension into the plot. Either way this is going to be a horrible figure. But its possible.
So.... I'm having troubles getting export_fig up and running... I've downloaded the .zip with files, unzipped, and put export_fig (folder with all files) into my toolbox directory. I modified the pathdef.m file in the local folder of the toolbox, and also did a rehash toolboxcache. When I'm trying to call export_fig, I'm still getting the undefined function error. Any tips?
Why don't they have access to MCR?
Can't you just use remote connect? Or are you trying to make it more polished?
I think this is starting to be a real problem. The front page of Matlab, ostensibly the hottest topics, has mostly "0" rated topics. Some of them are lazy homework questions but many are legitimate. 
I am not 100% sure how to help. Try just using `addpath('path/to/file')` in case you somehow didn't work. Also, try just `rehash` and see if that does anything.
To start with I just want something simple to work. In the long run it should be more advanced, where people will upload somekind of file input, and the app returns some plots after calculations, maybe an output file.
They could have access to MCR, but from what I understand you need the MCR version corresponding to the Matlab that compiled it? So I would rather have it working independently of what version of Matlab/MCR people have and even if they don't have anything at all.
This is what I do. figure(1); plot(x,y,'.'); axis square; saveas(gcf,'test.png,'png'); Then I open the image in GIMP or whatever editing program you like, and crop it. setting the axis to square *after* you issue the plot command is the key part here. Because it's a scripting language, everything occurs sequentially. 
&gt; for i=1:length(files.name) or just for i=3:length(files.name)
That might be a solution. I have approximately zero experience with this kind of stuff, and it was not what came up when I googled my problem. Is it easy? And do you know where to find some sort of documentation?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11989094/handle-computationally-intensive-requests-to-a-django-web-application-possibly kinda related. So set up a webserver, and behind that, a python-based application server (such as django). This is totally generic, there are plenty of tutorials available. e.g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn (ignore the bit about postgres, it's just a database. you don't say anything about needing a database, so i'm assuming you can ignore it). Then, in python-django, write your endpoint(s)...the functionalities that your users will make requests against. So www.yourserver.com/factorize_matrix will call the endpoint /factorize_matrix. That endpoint will call its associated function, such as factorize_matrix(). In that method, you can use one of the python-to-matlab bridges (e.g. http://mlabwrap.sourceforge.net/) , to call your matlab code. NB This is a bit different from what I said originally, as you're not calling matlab directly from your webserver. But this way seems nicer. That hard part for you (if you know nothing about all this) will be getting everything (webserver, appserver, matlab instances) to talk to each other, but maybe you have someone handy with web dev to help you with that?
Yes this is exactly what I am doing. I have seismic data that gives the location in 3d space, its amplitude (size), and its stage (color). It also contains the time that the event occurred. So what I want to do is show when the events occurred. I did not know if there was a way to "play" the scatter plot and see the events (data points) appear on the graph in sequence. If I do not use scatter3 what would you recommend?
you can compile the code into a single executable but it'll probably be easier to just transfer the code into a different language
You can save each figure, then recombine them in an animation if you want to do that. Just save the images as png or tiff and convert them all into a gif. Thats very simple. 
If you do this in multiple spots, you could create a function to clean up the code. I would do this in addition to Halsey117's suggestion. function x = incrementNegative(x) idx = x &lt; 0 x(idx) = x(idx) + 1
&gt; Because it's a scripting language .. and that's exactly what I want to take advantage of. I don't want to save some arbitrarilly sized figure and then open in another prog. and cut it by hand again. If I wanted to do that I would just use MATLABs figure GUI. I want to code, in my script that processes and plots the data, to make a blank canvas 8"x8" initially, execute my plotting commands, labels, titles, all that jazz, and then at the end accept some bounds (I guess these are what I don't know how to get) of an appropriate figure area, minimizing extra white space (which I can compute), croping the figure (another area that I don't know how to do), and finally ultimately saving it. All with no user input. I guess to your last sentence, heres a pseudocode example figure( ... ); % make figure and properties here, set domain to 8"x8" hold on; plot(line1); plot(line2); plot(line3); xlabel('This is fun'); ylabel('SO much fun'); title('How to have FUN!'); % **-- Ask for the "appropriate" axes/line/figure position property of this figure to be returned % **-- Compute what to crop from 8"x8" % **-- Actually CROP the figure print(); % print statement to print the figure to file
Sorry, but we don't do your homework here - even stated in the side bar ---&gt; . We'll help you work your way towards what you want to do and help you debug and get code working, but we're not here to provide code. You might also put an actual question in your OP - no one wants to read 3 pages of a HW.
If you are sure that the 'data' signal contains 3 signals you can try a 'demux' block to seperate them. Else you can use a 'to workspace' block to save the data and check in matlab what that signal contains. I have no idea what bit packing/unpacking means/does.
Hey man I actually did use the demux about 1 hour ago and it worked perfectly!
yes cftool to be exact with a 1 degree polynomial curve.
Use the plot editor (GUI) tool to tweak, in conjunction with what others have suggested. Then use [export_fig](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) to make a gorgeous plot. I usually use a command like: export_fig('-zbuffer', '-r300', '-a2', '-nocrop', 'NAMEOFFILE.tif') But there are, of course, many other ways to export a nice, high-res version with this little tool. Edit: I didn't see that /u/jwink3101 already mentioned export_fig. So I guess I'm like everyone and their mothers, but here's another vote for that method anyway :)
Well the first problem I see is that you have a for loop with c going from column 2 of the data to the last column but then have c = c+1 at the end of your else which does nothing and is confusing. That is what the for loop does, iterates through c= 2:repeat. I dont think the if and else are necessary. In the second part you are saying, do the second column no matter what - even if all zeros, then if the sum of the column is greter than 0 do that column; again both the c = c+1 lines are unnecessary. Your error comes from the lines: power = abs(ffta(2:n/2)).^2; power2 = abs(ffta(2:n/2)).^2; freq = (2:n/2)/n; if n is an odd number. Why start from the second entry of ffta? Instead of the if else is the first part you should just set power = []; before the for loop.
Something like norm(array1-array2)/norm(array1) &lt; 0.02 ? Don't have Matlab to try it out at the moment.
Yes that does seem to work. Thank you very much! I get a one for a match and zero elsewhere. The only thing I was hoping to get an answer in the form ans=[1 1 1 1] if the four elements matched or ans = [1 0 1 1] if only three elements matched. Is there a tweak that may do that? 
Thank you so much, you are an absolute legend. I just had to change it slightly so that the code looked like: (sqrt(sum(repmat(A,1,4) - repmat(B,1,4)).^2)) / norm(A) &lt; 0.02 but I can honestly say I would never had got it in a million years if it weren't for you. I'm kinda new to Matlab so I'm not sure if I quite understand what the code is doing if you want to add a quick explanation it would be great.

The Euclidean norm is by far the most commonly used norm on __R__^*n*, but there are other norms on this vector space as will be shown below. However all these norms are equivalent in the sense that they all define the same topology. &gt; --- ^Interesting: [^Violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence) ^| [^Pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) ^| [^Deaths ^in ^August ^2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_August_2012) ^| [^Deaths ^in ^May ^2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_May_2010) ^| [^2008 ^UCLA ^Bruins ^football ^team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_UCLA_Bruins_football_team) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cm0cm6v) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cm0cm6v)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
(a-b). /a &lt; 0.02 This compares the vectors element wise. Then you may use any(ans) or all(ans) to check wether some or all of the elements satisfy the tolerance
As of 14b you can build android apps from Simulink (without embedded coder). You could wrap your function up in a MATLAB function block and use the To App block to send it to your pre-built app. It would then build the android project automatically. If you don't have an app already you can build the whole mess in Simulink and deploy to the phone without writing a line of Java/Android/XML. http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/android-programming-simulink.html Officially it only supports Galaxy Nexus devices, but the project it creates should run on other devices. While I'm not 100% sure on that my impression is most android projects are generic.
Have you tried these two tools? matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/ (python) plotly: https://plot.ly/matlab/ (general)
The types of image representation would be Grayscale.Truecolor RGB.Indexed. Binary. uint8. Thank you so much for the explanation, i would've never find that online and it has helped me a lot these past days. I don't feel that lost now. Thanks a lot for your time :)
Note how he uses dir('*.mat'), creating a mask that only returns matlab files. This also ommitts current dir and dir up (. and ..). Using a wildcard like this enables you to return any file type, files with given prefixes, etc. 
Thanks a lot for your replies! But from what I understant you can have MCR on your server and let people run the app with that? Is that true? And if yes, wouldn't that be easier than this solution? 
The alternative is to not use the default formatting and customize the figure yourself. For example, compare the output of peaks to the output of fig = figure ax = gca; [x,y]=meshgrid(1:40,1:40); tri = delaunay(x,y); z = peaks(40); t= trimesh(tri,x,y,z) t.FaceColor = 'none' fig.Color = [0.1 0.1 0.1] ax.Color = [0.1 0.1 0.1]; ax.GridColor = [0.800 0.800 0.800] ax.GridAlpha = 0.4; ax.XRuler.Visible = 'off' ax.YRuler.Visible = 'off' ax.ZRuler.Visible = 'off' ax.XLim = [-20 60] ax.XTick = [-20:5:60] ax.YLim = [-20 60] ax.YTick = [-20:5:60] ax.View = [-38.5000 64.0000] zoom(3) l=camlight(45,90) l=camlight(45,45) lightangle(0,-45) l=camlight(-45,45) lighting phong http://imgur.com/a/D883J (r2014b)
Most high-dpi related issues I've found people discussing are about OSX. Has anyone tried R2014b on linux or windows 8.1 on a high-dpi display, is the scaling fixed?
