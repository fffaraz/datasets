I've got a windows and a linux box but I hate using MATLAB on the linux side. We're still on 32 bit and we can't update our MATLAB any further. Several of us and the sys admin have been pushing for 64bit but it's a pretty significant effort and management has trouble justifying it. It drives me crazy.
&gt;If I run islocalmin function on it, I am able to get a same sized matrix with 0s and 1s (1s corresponding to local minimas) I am not sure how they find a local minima Off the top of my head I don't know either, but the documentation should state this very clearly. Does it not? &gt;(whether they consider the 2d information or just column information) I can say it's unlikely, given typical Matlab "style" that this function is operating only on rows; but again, there's no reason to guess when the documentation is only a press of the F1 button away. &gt;I wanted to visualize the output. How do I plot those points corresponding to 1s on top of my spectrogram plot? If you have an array with 0s and 1s in it, there are a number of ways to visualize it. Most simply, you could use `imagesc` or `spy`. If you want to obtain those pixel locations as a list of coordinate values, you could use `find` to extract the row and column positions. You can then, if you want to, convert those (row, column) coordinates to some meaningful units if you know the axis scale of your image. &gt;Here's what I have done so far: &gt; &gt; &gt; [audio, fs] = audioread(path); &gt; &gt; &gt; f = figure(); &gt; [S,F,T] = spectrogram(audio, [], [], [], fs); &gt; S = 10*log10(abs(s)); &gt; [TF1,P] = islocalmin(S); &gt; imagesc(T, F, S) % this is plotting the spectrogram perfectly &gt; hold on; &gt; &gt;Now what do I write to plot TF1 matrix (which is the matrix of 0s and 1s)? This looks fine so far. I'm guessing you want to draw markers on top of your imagesc figure to indicate the minima? You can use `find` as I explained, to get the (row, column) indices, and after your `hold on` statement, you can use `plot` to add markers on the same set of axes containing the image.
First, please don't just do people's homework for them. You can help them, but on this sub we don't allow people to just do homework. Second, this won't work.
To find the intersection of two lines, you want to use [`fzero`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html).
There was just a post on this sub about this exact question that I answered. Also utilize Google and the math works website. Do some research, matlab us super well documented and this is something that you can find answers to easily.
Thank you, can we stop posting easily answered trivial questions. Admittedly I did help someone with this exact problem a day or two ago...but the went on to rant about how easy it is to solve this problem and how there are so many resources available to help. I would appreciate moderation of posts like this where students just ask for help answering hw questions
you already have a fcn "y", so in your case, just paste this part of the code into yours: `difference = y - y1;` `% use the find function to locate the vector position` `locationZero = find(difference == 0);` `% using matrix indexing, plot the point` `plot(x(locationZero),y(locationZero),'ko')` ...and rename y1 with the name of your fcn that is not "y"
that's fair. But now for my own curiosity, by "it won't work" do you mean that it won't work \*all the time\*?
In a just world, the people who made windows auto restart, and the people that made the idiotic auto recovery tool for office (this has gotten better actually), should be banned from owning or using any nonvolatile electronic storage medium for life.
Yeah, 14 hours is considerable, but not extreme. Deep neural networks will easily need some days to train for example.
Oof, yeah that's tough. We hit our memory limitation with work on 32 bit literally about 12 years ago and upgraded. Another minorly tricky thing about Matlab on Linux is shortcuts. You can have it use the windows key bindings but there are still certain things that I get tripped up on when switching from my mac machine to our Linux box.
Hello ! &amp;#x200B; You will need to use the `genvarname` function. I give you an example to understand. You will split your matrix in a loop, and each part will be named `partN`, N beeing the part number. Example : V = genvarname('part1'); eval([V '=5']); In the workspace you'll have "part1" and its value is 5. &amp;#x200B; For your whole matrix, let it call M. finish = 0; n = 1; last = 0; while not(finish) V = genvarname( strcat('part',num2str(n)) ); try ThePart = M(last+1:last+50); % you may need a +1 here, don't know - try :D catch ThePart = M(last+1:end); finish =1; end eval([V '=ThePart']); last = last + 50; n = n+1; end It may not be optimized though !
Well honestly, the only bright spot in our quest to upgrade to 64bit is that 32bit is considered a security violation. The govt is serious about that stuff so hopefully we can push forward soon. And yeah I had to change all my bindings. I just couldn't get used to the linux bindings. I'm just so much more comfortable on my windows machine lol.
If you're finding a symbolic expression for the solution to your equation, you should only need to find it once. Write that solution as a numerical expression and evaluate it as necessary. Alternatively, numerical root finding should still be fine. Ultimately there's no magic to using symbolic manipulation to find the root of an equation. If it's delivering a number in the end, it had to either perform numerical root finding methods, or evaluate a closed form expression for the root. You can do both of those things just as robustly without ever involving symbolic tools. Running in a loop doesn't make much difference really, unless it becomes an efficiency issue. You should be able to obtain a "good enough" initial guess pretty easily unless this function is some monstrosity with multiple nearby solutions. Quad (which has been replaced by `integral`, by the way) is for doing quadrature integration not root finding. I don't know how it would work for you unless there is some way to obtain the value you need as the result of an integral. Fzero should be a reliable and efficient way to solve equations/find zeros/find intersections. A symbolic value can be converted to a numerical value by a number functions. They're well documented but I don't know them off the top of my head. Just search the documentation as usual.
1) Define empty 1 dimension arrays (50 of them). You may use a loop to define them. Just create 50 empty 1 dimensional arrays 2) create a for loop for the 86859 rows matrix and another loop that counts till 50 only. As long as the counter is less than 50, the loop copies the value from the big array to the first empty array. When the counter reaches 50, it is rest and the loop copies the value from the big array to the second empty array, and so on. It shouldn't be complicated!
So check for updates before starting the 14h run?
As a rule, if your solution involves using `eval` there is a better solution out there. Very true in this case.
I would pad your original vector with enough NaN's to make it evenly divisible by 50, and then use [`reshape`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/reshape.html) to reshape your long vector into an array which is 50xn. And now, you can just compare every column of the array to each other (and min/max ignore NaN's, so you're good there).
linspace is for when you want to specify how many steps to divide a range into.
If the time is regular intervals, couldn’t you just make another vector such as: t = (1:length(timeVec))*timeStep
For this kind of simple problem if guess it's ok :)
Given a matrix `M` (of any size) that you want to split across rows (every `s` rows), try the following function: function C = split_rows(M, s) [r,c] = size(M); a = fix(r / s); b = r - a*s; C = mat2cell(M, [repmat(s, a, 1); b], c); end The result is stored in the cell-array `C`. It should work even if the number of rows is not evenly divided by `s = 50`. For example consider the following matrix: &gt;&gt; M = reshape(1:50, 10, 5) M = 1 11 21 31 41 2 12 22 32 42 3 13 23 33 43 4 14 24 34 44 5 15 25 35 45 6 16 26 36 46 7 17 27 37 47 8 18 28 38 48 9 19 29 39 49 10 20 30 40 50 The result of splitting every 3 rows would be: &gt;&gt; C = split_rows(M, 3) C = 4×1 cell array {3×5 double} {3×5 double} {3×5 double} {1×5 double} &gt;&gt; celldisp(C) C{1} = 1 11 21 31 41 2 12 22 32 42 3 13 23 33 43 C{2} = 4 14 24 34 44 5 15 25 35 45 6 16 26 36 46 C{3} = 7 17 27 37 47 8 18 28 38 48 9 19 29 39 49 C{4} = 10 20 30 40 50
why the `eval` thing?? Just use a cell array to store the sub-matrices.
newmatrix = nan(50, 1738); newmatrix(1:86859) = oldmatrix &amp;#x200B; Then just do max() to get the maximum of each column.
It's just my proposition. Go on with yours I will also take it down :)
I just meant that using `eval` that way is an anti-pattern: - https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/string-evaluation.html#brqy1gs-4 - https://matlab.fandom.com/wiki/FAQ#How_can_I_create_variables_A1.2C_A2.2C....2CA10_in_a_loop.3F
I don't know if that would work because one function is linear, but the other isn't really a function. It is just data.
Oof... Well you've got to do something... You can try least squares or some other interpolation but I'd recommend writing some sort of function to describe the data. You'd be doing something similar if you did it graphically as well though you may not realize it...
Since you seem to be stuck on the first step... you can assign variables with the equals sign. So your first line should be pounds = 30; This assigns the value of 30 to the variable pounds. The next line would be to assign a value to the variable kilo: kilo = ???
It returns the same type as the input perhaps to be consistent with bitand, bitor, and the other bit related functions. If you want logicals, it's easy enough to get them.
I am aware of using this technique, the issue is that the data in the matrices won't have matching data points and comparing the functions won't work either because one of the plots isn't a clear cut function. I was just wondering if their was a function or method for this already. I do have an idea for solving this. I am aware that a rule for any Reddit community is to research before asking questions, which I did. If you don't like when people ask questions about matLab don't reply which will encourage it. The program I am writing is for fun, not homework. Also, the last paragraph was unnecessary. It's a little annoying.
There is a lot more to the problem which I haven't shown. I have been able to solve this issue of the if statement but i have issues with ODEs. I can show you the problem in more detail in a PM? Thanks for the help
This is not homework tho.. This is just me not understanding the simplest things in MATLAB .. 😅
For sure! I just wanted an explanation, and yours makes sense. Thank you!
Please post the actual error message when asking for help. "line 28 in gradientDescent has a dfifferent number of elements" doesn't make any sense and makes life needlessly hard for people who might be willing to help you because now they have to speculate what the error really is. My _guess_ is that the error message you're getting is In an assignment A(:) = B, the number of elements in A and B must be the same. This would indicate that computeCost() does return a vector instead of a scalar value (meaning that it does not return the correct result). From looking at your code I can see that y needs to be a column vector. If you're accidentally passing it as a row vector, line 19 in computeCost() returns a matrix instead of a vector, and by extension line 21 (and therefore the function as a whole) returns a vector instead of a scalar. This would result in the above error message. So, make sure that y is column vector.
Sorry, couldn’t copy the exact error message from the assignment. And thank you, but y is a column vector, already coded in the assignment. But I found the problem :)
What was it?
I found solution and i learned to solve ode in Matlab. Thank you anyway.
+Thank you very very much. Your explanations have finally allowed me to actually understand what I was trying it accomplish and the limitations of it. There is several ways I could proceed now, but I will convert it using "eval" to get an output to be used in trapz. Thanks for the help.
What do you mean it's not a clear cut function? And what do you mean they won't have matching data points? If you have plotted them dont you just have two vectors describing the data? You should explain your problem a little better maybe. But the find function is a clear cut function to do exactly what you want. It seems like your issue is generating a data set describing what you've plotted, but I'm a little confused how you have managed to plot two lines without already having this. Sorry for assuming it was homework or talking down, my bad.
Eval is about the worst way to do that. I'm not ever sure where you found a suggestion to try that. At least use vpa(), if you insist on using symbols at all. Just be aware that abusing symbolic math like this is going to be very slow computationally, and prone to unexpected weird failures.
I don't know if this will work but I am going to try to make my linear function have the same x-values as the curve. That way I can compare each y value by index using a for loop and find the difference between the y-values of each "line". I will have it so the difference data is put into a matrix, find the minimum value, index this value to find the coordinates for the linear function. It won't be exact but their is so much data that it will be close enough. &amp;#x200B; Do you guys think this will work?
I think I see what you're saying, that they dont intersect at discrete values, in that case you can use find(min(abs(X-Y)))
That is because `bitget` predates logical values. bitget was present since R11 or earlier, while logical values (and integer values) were not introduced until R12.
Like I said, very new and English not my home language, so apologies for any mistranslation. Unfortunately I haven't solved the problem, and I think I'm now following an unvectorised implementation, but when I run [this code](https://pastebin.com/4V0v7yT8) step by step through debugging, I get some output at least. When I run it on the assignment page, it just returns infinity. So not really any closer to the solution haha. I put the necessary info in comments on the code.
Yeah Your function is super hard to read (I'm on my phone so can't plug it into Matlab). What do you get as an output? Do you get an error when running the function? Also, quickly glancing at your code, why do you do a matrix multiplication even when multiplying scalars?
Yeah sorry just been focussed on trying to get it to work! I get TTT (50x1) as the output. Now I have been editing it, I get an error about the if statements for the do2 value. I used the .* Because I thought originally it was going to need that but it doesn't, sorry!
Ok, so I guess I didn't understand the question. I thought you wanted a 50x1 output but weren't able to get it. Also, if you need help with the error, you'll need to tell us what the error is and the line of code that's causing it.
No... but no who should use r2012...
Should be okay. I haven’t had that specific combo installed, but I have had multiple versions installed at the same time.
&gt;but no who should use r2012 Does this mean “why use r2012?”? If so, yeah, I’ve been pushing to switch to a newer version or python, but hey 🤷‍♀️
MATLAB is installed to a separate Program Files folder for each version installation. &amp;#x200B; So if you install both r2012A and r2018A, you have two full installations of MATLAB on your computer, and the toolboxes need to be installed separately for each one as well. &amp;#x200B; So there are no issues, you can have both versions open because of this too if you'd like. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I'd recommend working on 2018A if you can personally just because of the quality of life upgrades and performance improvements, but just make sure the work you do is compatible with 2012A. Normally that just means checking to make sure the functions you're using work.

Yeah i was on 2018 but im just gonna switch so i dont have to check on anything haha
Thanks!
Okay! Thanks
Whatever floats your boat. I had a senior coworker who was similar. Too scared to move from 2014 because of the 'potential glitches'. Got around to convincing them to upgrade after showing there is really nothing to worry about.
He works with another lab in Japan and theyre probably the problem. Either way, too lazy lol He should be on python either way
No one*, sorry.
Oh shit I'm in a beginner Matlab engineering course and mine all run instantly😂
Oh shit I'm in a beginner Matlab engineering course and mine all run instantly😂
Lets try a different approach: x = [1:86859]'; n = 50; x = reshape([ x; nan(n - mod(size(x,1),n),1) ], [], n);
Hmm, I'll have a try of some of the other such as vpa.
Sucks. That said, any code that is taking so long to run in matlab would probably benefit from a port to C+... -_-
You can transpose the matrix and do column stacking, i.e. for a matrix f, f_T = f.', f_column = f_T(:)
In each step of the loop you are redefining the first column of output. Instead, you want to append to the output. FYI, you you can do this concatenation much faster without using loops. Without trying to give the answer away, take a look at what you can do with the colon https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html.
I suppose this is cheating since the above user. But could you do this: --- output = input.' ; finaloutput = output(:); --- Ok so I understand both lines using the Mathworks page you provided and the one on the dot-transpose: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/transpose.html This answers part (b) of the question. But it's part (a) that asks for a for loop. The other user said to try column stacking, but using that solution looks like it takes the entire input matrix and returns a column vector in one step as shown above. Could you still use this concept in a for loop though?
Thank You, but doesn't that solution not use a for loop? I need a for loop in the answer.
&gt; If investment returns 15% the first year, 50% the second, and 30% the third year. I think this is a problem with your worksheet and not your Reddit post, then. Anyway, your assignment is really just creating variables and doing basic arithmetic. If you need help with syntax, you can get that from the built-in documentation.
For the for loop option, I would append to a vector. What happens if you call list=[]; list=[list;1]; list=[list;2]; Etc. what does list look like after each step?
yes, you can have multiple version installed side-by-side with no problem. and for those wondering, I think R2012a was the last version before MATLAB switched to the ribbon interface, so maybe your mentor likes the old interface :) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB#Release_history - https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2012/09/12/the-matlab-r2012b-desktop-part-1-introduction-to-the-toolstrip/
That’s definitely a quicker way to solve the problem. I can’t say if it’s cheating with respect to the assignment.
first step: list is empty. second step: list contains [1;] third step: list contains [1; 2;] I understand that you have to append the column vector to the output column after each iteration of the for loop. But don't you need some way of indexing each column you append to the final and growing output? In other words it'd be: list = [list.1; list.2; list.3.....list.(i = size(input,1)) ??
Why?
I’m not quite sure what your question is. You don’t have to worry about indexing the output vector that you are growing. In each step, you are essentially creating a new vector that includes your old output vector and a transposed row of your input vector. You only need to worry about the index for the input array.
R2012a was the last version to have the classic interface, I do remember holding onto that one for a long time.
I'm still on R2008A. :P Anyway, lots of institutions are still using older versions. Heck, I know someone still on R6.5.
I find it always funny to see how inflexible people in science, where new things are being created, are. It's the same at our institute. SW from 10 years ago because the prof does not like the look&amp;feel of the newer versions. :D
I'm sorry, I'm just not seeing why we wouldn't need to index the output vector. This is what I came up with: --------- for i=1:size(input,1) output(:,1) = input(i,:)'; finaloutput(:,1) = [output;]; end --------------- But that shows an error in the third line. I figured indexing would be required because each column appending to the final output column vector is done once per iteration of the for loop.
It's more that you have to adapt to a new workflow, which makes you inefficient for a while. Imagine if you are playing Xbox and a patch is installed that makes your joystick sensitivity completely different. It would probably enrage you for a while until you got used to it. In the case of computer workflow, people perfect their own over time and it doesn't make sense to change it unless you have to, or if you can make it more efficient.
You have this i take it? https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31900-edfread
If you type in doc, you'll bring up the documentation. In particular, you should read up on the section under Matlab - Getting Started. After you get a basic grasp of how matrices are handled in Matlab, you want to read up of creating matrices in Matlab. And......that's about all you need for this actually.
Two observations: 1. Check your assignment/ask the prof whether he meant ‘use a function’ or ‘write a function’ — there doesn’t seem to be much value in just asking you to call a built in function. 2. I doubt there is a built in function for this — you’re going to have to write one. First step is to work out what you’d do if you were going to do this manually — it’d be a long process but you could do it. Write it out step by step, then convert it to code. This sub can help you with the latter, but you’ve gotta do the former first.
1. It was probably write a function 😅😅. I mentioned the 'sum' and 'prod' to simplify, in reality is used the individual selection of elements in matrix and made the variables Sum and Product by adding and multiplying individual element, respectively. 2. Thanks for your insight
[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import\_export/exporting-to-excel-spreadsheets.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/exporting-to-excel-spreadsheets.html)
I second reading the doc pages but check out using the identity function called eye() and the diag() function. You probably also want to look up functions called ones() and zeros()
Look back to my example with the “a” array. In each step I am calling the entire vector “a” and appending a new term. On the left hand side, I am completely redefining “a”, so there is no need to use any indexing.
I would start by just typing a=arduino() In to your command window. And matlab will return the properties of your arduino (COM port, arduino model, etc). if it does, Then check to make sure the com port is correct. If it tells you that an arduino isn’t found. Reinstall the arduino toolbox and try again. You will also need to have a serial code on your arduino to pass the matlab commands through.
Are you trying to fit a circle to the dataset ? The average of the data would most likely be a point close to the centre which is probably not what you're after.
Maybe convert to polar coordinates and then calculate the average radius?
yes trying to fit a circle to the data sheet. I thin u/eyebrowgamestrong has got the right idea, find the average in polar coordinates. Any tips on how to do that? Plus connect the points in a graph?
You could use fminsearch to perform a least squares fit using the equation for a circle. If the data is in a easy enough format, I'd be interested in taking a look with you!
Thanks for the help! Here's a link to two sets of data, as Matlab files. Just interested in having the two sets of Y data plotted against each other. X data is just time. [https://we.tl/t-7BJeWpAxk1](https://we.tl/t-7BJeWpAxk1)
&gt;https://we.tl/t-7BJeWpAxk1 Here's a couple of the data sets if you would like to try! /u/[com\_kieffer](https://www.reddit.com/user/com_kieffer)
Thanks
Hmmm... I'm not sure I understand the files you sent. When I plot x vs. y I get squiggly lines, not circles. Also, the two datasets have different length so I can't directly plot them against each other.
You'll have to plot the two Y data sets against each other, essentially I have a sin and cos input, so naturally if you plotted the Y data against X (time) you'll get squiggly lines
ok... but... one vector has length 5005, one has length 3003. They can't be plotted against each other so you're doing some sort of processing and I don't know what it is...
Sorry! The files are separate, the Y data in each file is a structure, containing 4 sets of data. You'll want the first two sets, like ydata = displacement026.Y(1).Data; ydata2 = displacement026.Y(2).Data;
There are lot of published algorithms for finding a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a circle given some x-y points. Just use one of those.
Is nobody going to point out the horror of voluntarily using Excel to generate plots when the data is already in Matlab? Just... Why?
Alright! I've solved it! I did it two ways. Average radius as suggested by u/eyebrowgamestrong and my least-squares fitted circle. While the average radius is easier, the problem is your data is not centered at exactly (0,0) so it has an inherent error. Here are the results (for displacement026): https://imgur.com/a/tAKxdf9 x0 = 0.0208 y0 = -0.0064 radius = 0.2322 Here's the script: https://pastebin.com/BhUsFj1v

Amazing! This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
The same reason people use MATLAB. That's all they know. Or, perhaps more generously, it's what they know best.
I would consider looking into fitting am ellipse, just in case the data is not actually circular, but I'm not in a position to do that right now. If I remember, I might try when I get home.
 ...CurData(Comp,Volt) There's your problem right there. `Comp` is a cell array, hence the error.
Shouldn't being in curly braces "unpack" the cell array and return the contents though?
Never mind I see it. Silly mistake, thanks for the catch!
Two problems with what you just typed: 1. It's not in curly braces. 2. It wouldn't matter if you indexed it properly, as the values in `Comp` are character vectors, which wouldn't be valid indices.
No problem, we've all been there!
Hey, that was really helpful. I have had good progress so far. This is my code as of now: [audio, fs] = audioread(path); f = figure(); [S,F,T] = specgram(audio); S = 10*log10(abs(S)); [TF1,P] = islocalmin(S); imagesc(T, F, S) hold on; [I, J] = find(TF1); I = (I/max(I)) .* max(T); J = (J/max(J)).* max(F); plot(I, J, 'r*'); DBT = delaunay(I, J); triplot(DBT, I, J); I just have to do some modifications so that I dont have way too many points for the triangles, by thresholding and segmenting before Delaunay Triangulation. Thanks again!

Yes indeed, thank you for sharing though! I am able to successfully read in the full file- I’m just having trouble writing two new files that each have a subset of the full file as the data.
Glad I could help! Image thresholding can be simple or tricky. There's a lot of algorithms out there that can get pretty impressive, but try to keep it simple if possible. You might play with some morphological operations to clean the image up, but it can be a deep rabbit hole if you're not careful. &gt;Edit: I am not sure if I gave you a point. If not please tell me how and I shall reply again LOL, I'm not sure either. I've had trouble getting that to work for me in the past. I think the plus sign needs to be on a line all by itself? Not sure. Thanks either way :)
thanks man. this worked.
This is just off the top of my head, but iirc LM is restricted in which performance functions it can use. This means that if you want to use a different performance function you need to choose a different training algorithm.
Matlab has built in functions for converting between Cartesian and polar coordinates. Look up `cart2pol` and give things a try. It should then be straightforward to take the average of the tests like radius vector. Give it a shot and ask for help if you get stuck.
in the command center type "help function"
I don't want to make it a function.
Unless you're indexing a table or struct, in which case a char array is a valid index!
I agree, however, switching from one MATLAB version to another usually doesn't impact your workflow that much, doesn't it? My experience is that it adds handy features and new functions which are a lot more efficient than the code you (well, in this example I) wrote in the past. Off course there are compatibility issues. These can, however, be fixed quiet fast. I do not know how it worked with v6 but today the doc usually gives quick solutions for such problems and, even better, warns you that some features might not be supported anymore in future releases. In my opinion a professor should favor the latest technology higher than the ease of use of a GUI, which is only easy to use because he does not want to learn about new features which would make it even easier to use.
Stages should not be modeled as a subclass of rocket. Stages should be an attribute of rocket.
So a circle has can be described by a vector center (x,y) and a radius r. First calculate x and y as the mean along both dimensions. Then to estimate r simply take the average of the distance between each and your estimated center. This should work well.
you can use polyval inside of a custom interp function
You can make a rocket a column vector of stages. There are two basic ways to do this. The easy way is to have your rocket class have an attribute `stages` that is a column vector of stages. You would then have the constructor (the method with the same name as the class) create the stages and concatenate them together. Methods would operate on this vector. The proper, but hard, way would be to override indexing on your rocket class. So a rocket would simply be a matrix of stages. The methods would act directly on the class elements. But those is really hard to get right.
You have to input the array that you want to view into the imagesc function. For example, you could call imagesc(myArray) To image the array “myArray”
I realize you posted this reply months ago, but I'm new here (biologist with zero coding experience) and did a quick search for resources for beginners - so I've already done the onramp, and still obviously have a lot to learn. Are you aware of any additional tutorials or practice problem/data sets that are available? It's a big jump to go from onramp to the type of data analysis I'm trying to learn how to do, I need another "ramp"! :)
I can see one thing that might be part of the problem. I think you need to specify input arguments for the testfunction. Normally, events send two arguments to their callback, in your case the testfunction. You could try this, function testfunction(varargin)
Here is a nice tutorial on how to continuously acquire data until an event occurs (in this case it is a 1V trigger): &amp;#x200B; [https://www.mathworks.com/help/daq/examples/acquire-continuous-and-background-data-using-ni-devices.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/daq/examples/acquire-continuous-and-background-data-using-ni-devices.html) &amp;#x200B; I would say take a stab using this method, and if you can't make it work come bask and let us know what errors you are getting, or issues you are having!
/u/half_a_lime is correct. trainlm is restricted to the use of mse or sse as the performance function. But then again, I seem to recall seeing some papers on modifying Levenberg-Marquardt to work with cross-entropy (admittedly, I looked at the title only). If that's what you really want then I suppose that's what you should look into.
Thank you both! I think true/false positive &amp; negative rates might be enough for me to describe the performance! I might include MSE but I’ve seen a lot of disregard for it in measuring classification performance
It's a good practice to name your file as something that isn't an existing function in Matlab.
Agree with u/spicy_jalapeno - change the name of your file and rerun.
for me this is good reason: *static final double c = 1079252849;* Thanks but no thanks. If you don't carry the units as in 299792458 m/s then it is a disaster waiting to happen. Carrying the units only works in symbolic expressions which I only do in Mathematica.
Change the font to one where you can distinguish lowercase L, 1 and uppercase i. I think Lucida console does it.
white text on a black background.
On this topic I can really recommend Matlab Schemer, which allows you to transfer your color scheme between different machines as well as choose from a few presets. It’s on the file exchange: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53862-matlab-schemer Also, I personally prefer slightly yellowish white on dark grey background to put less strain on the eyes.
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53862-matlab-schemer
Ok lol I just posted exactly this.
And change tab inserts spaces to simply tabs
What is a vsz file? Do you have a specification for that format? Do you want to save the code into that file, or to save data/image/audio etc?
&gt; I always have some error What error are you getting? The MATLAB errors are very descriptive. If you tell us the error, it's more likely we can help.
What you want is to use [`ndgrid`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ndgrid.html) (which is the n-dimensional version of ['meshgrid'](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/meshgrid.html) ). Combine that with [element-wise multiplication](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/times.html) and you're done!
If they always make an enclosed area, then use [`fzero`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html) to find where they intersect, and then use [`integral`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/integral.html) to integrate both between the intersection points and take the absolute value of the difference.
I was trying to apply hamming window to every single frame like this: frame(i,:)= (y(temp +1 : temp + f_size)).*w; and the error was : Unable to perform assignment because the indices on the left side are not compatible with the size of the right side. &amp;#x200B; I have no idea how to apply hamming window to each frame and I searched everywhere.
I think if you use "./" in your function, so that it reads: A=(x-(cos(x).*sin(x)))./(x.^2) as well as removing axis equal this should fix your problems
Move the windows around. You don’t need the current folder or the various other defaults taking up space all the time, you can minimize them so that you can view them when needed. I’m shocked that nobody else I know makes the Editor and Command window side by side taking up the screen.
\+
Teacher told me to split my recording into smaller parts, then use hamming window for every part and at the end I have to use auto-correlation for every single part and show frequency on a graph.
Thanks for your quick reply, Ive just run that and it appears to just be plotting the graph for y=1/x , so it must be ignoring the cos(x)sin(x) term?
Try x = -200:0.01:200; to avoid undersampling.
You can use `&amp;` to do element-by-element comparison. So `a=x&gt;y &amp; x&lt;z` will return a matrix `a` that is `1` for elements of `x` where both conditions are true and `0` for elements of `x` when either condition is false. You can then do `x(a)` to get all elements of `x` for which `a` is `1`.
Thanks, Ive got it to work now i think. I changed it to; &gt;x=-5:0.01:5; &gt; &gt;A=(x-(cos(x).\*sin(x)))./(x.\^2) ; &gt; &gt;figure &gt; &gt;% Plot the function. &gt; &gt;plot(x, A, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2); &gt; &gt;grid on; &gt; &gt;xlabel('x', 'FontSize', 15); &gt; &gt;ylabel('A', 'FontSize', 15); &gt; &gt;% Make a black line at the x and y axes &gt; &gt;line(xlim, \[0, 0\], 'Color', 'k', 'LineWidth', 2); &gt; &gt;line(\[0, 0\], ylim, 'Color', 'k', 'LineWidth', 2); Removing the linspace and defining it like x=-5:0.01:5; seems to have done the trick. &amp;#x200B; Thanks both of you.
The range is large so you are only seeing the dominate term. Think about it like this: &amp;#x200B; 1/x - (sin(x)\*cos(x))/x\^2) &amp;#x200B; the second term is always less than 1/x\^2 &amp;#x200B; The first term dominates as you get farther from x=0. Try plotting x=-3.14:.01:3.14 if you want to see the effects of the 2nd term
Yes that was likely one of the issues, I had assumed the range to be arbitrary since i could zoom in further but the intervals were not small enough to notice the effects.
That seems perfect, thank you! I'm used to doing two dimensional element wise multiplication but not three.. Could you help with an example?
42" monitor at work and I usually do 3 side by side editor windows in the top 2/3 of the screen and have the command window at the bottom. Another couple editor windows on my 2 portrait monitors, and I still find myself with not enough screen space lol. Let's just say I use MATLAB a lot and would be lost without my big monitor. Also great for full screen figures with 12 subplots or 3 long time series plots. linkaxes is your friend
It's really no different. If you make your items with meshgrid or ndgrid, it just works. For example: [X, Y, Z] = meshgrid(1:5,1:10,1:20); sample = X.*Y.*Z;
I'm guessing we don't have all of your code? Did you pre-allocate `frame` somewhere? That error makes it look like you made a variable named `frame` somewhere, and it's the wrong size for what you're returning.
Dominant. Dominate is a verb.
ehmm...thats actually my whole code :/
\*fixed
The name has changed. In 18b and before it was called the audio systems toolbox. Is it available under that name?
Select a fixed width font that clearly distinguishes parenthesis, braces, and brackets. It sounds obvious, but so many mistakes arise from that. I suggest Consolas on Windows and Monaco on Mac. Also turn on Emacs-style tab indenting for the editor.
It turns out my university didn't license it, but fortunately I'm on exchange at a university that does!
Your variable t probably never equals one. I realize that this may not make sense but hang with me. 0.1 cannot be exactly represented by a computer. So, if I had to guess what's happening, t=0.99999999... but never 1.0. I would recommend generally avoiding modulo with real numbers for reasons like this. You'd probably be best suited to use an integer to count to 10 or 100 or whatever.
That's what I would recommend as well. OP, if you want to compare non-integer numbers (e.g. floats), you should generally use epsilon (a certain tolerance). See: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eps.html
Sparse matrices should do the trick https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/sparse-matrices.html
Oh I see, that makes sense. Yeah I ended up just using a count integer but thought modulo would've been more efficient. Thanks!
&gt; avoiding modulo with real numbers As well all know, the real numbers cannot represent most numbers, and conveniently provide two values for zero. I do get what you mean by real numbers, but it reminded me of a hilarious article I read a week ago from SigBovik about NaN gates. http://tom7.org/nand/ Or this: http://sigbovik.org/2019/proceedings.pdf , page 98
if you want to completely remove the zeros, you can also do: &amp;#x200B; data = data(data\~=0);
What if I want to cut them down to half.. so for example if I have a 100 consecutive zeros, how can I make them only 50?
This is a bit confusing... Can you paste the tables in the question?
Divisions (and therefore remainders) are among the slowest primitive math operations there are.
You might want to look into the [eval command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eval.html)
Look into `str2func`. You'll have to type in your input as a char, but it'll work
Seems I wasn't adding the correct number of m(1) and m(2) to the second line of the function. I think its running, aka: Solved!
Very interesting, didn't know that. Thanks!
take a look at "find", especially like: &amp;#x200B; zeroLocs = find(data == 0); &amp;#x200B; you may just need to write a loop that combs through your data and checks for contiguous 0's.
you could use the disp() function and display it however you want
Please fix the formatting of your code. For your error, is your w0 a scalar?
Yeah, should have mentioned that, w0, w and gamma are all scalar
Where are you setting the value of w0? In another function?
Yeah, you can, if you want the first row of the first cell of myCellArray for instance, you'd call myCellArray{1,1}(1,:)
Yeah, in another "run"-script, which is suppose to test the function.
Are you declaring w0 as a global before setting it in that function too? Would be helpful to see that except of the code too.
For different input files, there are a lot of ways to do that. You can prompt for an input string for the file name, you can have it get the list of files in a folder and go through them or pick one at random. It all depends on what logic you need behind choosing a different file (is it choosing randomly or does it need to go through all the files or is it a user defined file) Here's for standalone code: https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/23369-generating-standalone-executable-file-using-matlab-coder
Hmm no i dont think so, as of know i havent even got to the "run"-script, so i give all the scalars values in the command window and then i call the function just to see if it gives me anything. I have also put the scrips in its own file, so no other values with the same name disturbs it.
Ok, in the command line you need to do: &gt;&gt; global w0 &gt;&gt; w0 = (whatever value you want)
Regular workspace and global workspace are two different workspaces, so if you just assign a value to w0 without declaring it global, it won't work
Yes!!! Thank you, it finally works! My struggle has come to an end! Really nice, thanks!
It worked perfectly, thanks! If you don't mind one more question, how does "evaluate" works and how could've it gone wrong? Really tried looking into this function, but didn't even understand how it works.
Hey, I used the method the other guy suggested. But thanks for the help too. I'll look into "eval" and see what it can do.
You don't need for loops. You can try: k = 1:100 M = [k((k-1)/lamda&lt;tau) k(k/lambda&gt;=tau)]
As a side note, using globals is a generally discouraged practice as it can make for some pretty tricky-to-fix bugs.
Ha, upon looking at the documentation for eval (which I used to use all the time), it turns out I'd been using it for all the wrong reasons. I used to use it to create variables (and for a few other tasks), but there is a good page in documentation explaining alternatives: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/string-evaluation.html
This is why globals are bad.
The way variables are displayed when you leave out a `;` is meant for debugging purposes, not displaying data in a working piece of code. If you want to display data in a formatted way, you have to actually do it yourself via fprintf or something like that.
For the file part: You could use `uigetfile` which opens a dialog box that returns the file path and file name. For the standalone code: refer to u/Morningstarrr18 's comment and use matlab coder
[removed]
&gt; ... I am able to plot my derivative variables but I am not able to get the right plot of other variables. What other variables? Where do they come from? What command are you using to plot them? &gt; I tried them to plot using for loop. Why? &gt; I learned about fprintf command to extract values from function file but not getting accurate syntax. This is misguided. [Here is the documentation for `fprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html). Its purpose is to create a formatted string, with the option to write to file (whereas `sprintf` is the best string formatting choice without the need to write to file). At best you could give the function value at a point as an argument to be added to the formatted string. &gt; Please help Help us help you. Give more detailed information about your problem, share the code that is causing trouble, provide any error messages you're getting, and someone will most likely be able to help. As is, you haven't given enough information for anyone to give you any meaningful help.
There's a help page for that. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html If you just want to see numbers, you can always just use disp(variable_name) Or write the variable name without a semicolon. Or double click on it in the variable explorer window. Or...
Thanks for the tip!
Like /u/angrmgmt00 said, nothing in your posts makes sense. The function `fprintf` has nothing to do with "extracting values from functions".
It should run fine. It might NOT run fine IF you've renamed another function conv? What does "help conv" display in matlab? I'd also try restarting your PC, but that's more of a long shot.
I get the following: &gt; conv Convolution and polynomial multiplication. C = conv(A, B) convolves vectors A and B. &gt; &gt;...
Did you just recently install matlab or has it been installed for a while? Honestly, it sounds wonky, but have you tried restarting your computer? Is your PC on hardware supported by matlab? Which version are you rocking? Your code runs fine for me, so I'm inclined to think it's a different problem.
Thank you. I have restarted and it works now. I have had MATLAB on for about a year now and i am running R2018a. Everything was working fine recently up until this error.
I had to update all the academic licenses I use recently which may be related to your issue as well.
Glad it worked out.
It seems you need to compile the code to create the mex file. Sometimes mex files are given but this is architecture dependent, so it could work for you or not. You can do two things, compile yourself (check it out how to do it in Mathworks website) or open an issue in that github project and request it (but I just saw you already did).
what's the error/what function isn't working?
Sweet, thanks! I thought that might be it, this narrows down the scope of my efforts considerably :D
A for loop would allow me to not have to list every single combination. It would simplify the function.
35,000 76,000 82,000 23,800 130 103 93 111 258 518 518 80 1 0 0 1 19.4 20.4 19.4 11.4 5 5 7 2 42.7 42.7 41.2 41.2 40.3 38.8 41.7 39.7 CarFile.xlsx
So...what is the error/what function isn't working? Is it that you have two inputs to one of the for loops? for [m,n] This won't work. But I don't know if this is your error. You have to be super specific when asking questions because we can't see your screen.
Here is the original function that I believe can be simplified: &amp;#x200B; function \[Cars\] = CarCompare ( ) % This function compares cars % Written by Jacob Heiser clc format compact close all help CarCompare2 \[num,\~,\~\] = xlsread('CarFile.xlsx'); TeslaModel3 = num(:,1); TeslaModelS = num(:,2); TeslaModelX = num(:,3); SmartElectric = num(:,4); &amp;#x200B; Tesla\_Model\_3 = TeslaModel3'; Tesla\_Model\_S = TeslaModelS'; Tesla\_Model\_X = TeslaModelX'; Smart\_Electric = SmartElectric'; &amp;#x200B; disp('The cars available for comparison are:') disp('1:Tesla Model 3 2:Tesla Model S 3:Tesla Model X 4: Smart Electric') disp('Answer like this: e.g. \[1 2\]') Cars = input('Input two values that represent which cars you want to compare in square brackets='); spec = {'MSRP (USD)'; 'MPG'; 'HorsePower'; 'Drivetrain'; 'Turning Radius (Feet)';'Seats';'Leg Room (Inch)'; 'Head Room (Inch)' }; if Cars(1)==1 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==2 || Cars(1)==2 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==1 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_3' , 'Tesla\_Model\_S'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_3' , Tesla\_Model\_S' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) elseif Cars(1)==2 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==3 || Cars(1)==3 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==2 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_S' , 'Tesla\_Model\_X'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_S' , Tesla\_Model\_X' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) elseif Cars(1)==1 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==3 || Cars(1)==3 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==1 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_S' , 'Tesla\_Model\_X'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_S' , Tesla\_Model\_X' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) elseif Cars(1)==1 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==4 || Cars(1)==4 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==1 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_3' , 'Smart\_Electric'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_3' , Smart\_Electric' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) elseif Cars(1)==2 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==4 || Cars(1)==4 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==2 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_S' , 'Smart\_Electric'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_S' , Smart\_Electric' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) elseif Cars(1)==3 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==4 || Cars(1)==4 &amp;&amp; Cars(2)==3 varNames={'Specs' ,'Tesla\_Model\_X' , 'Smart\_Electric'}; disp(table( spec ,Tesla\_Model\_X' , Smart\_Electric' , 'VariableNames',varNames)) else disp('Please enter two cars: e.g. \[1 2\], \[2 1\], \[2 3\] etc...') pause(5) \[Cars\] = CarCompare ( ); end
Right. Ok I get that. But what is the exact problem you have? Is the problem that you'd like us to simplify it for you?
I tried to simplify it myself. I should understand while and for loops. I enjoy learning and I would hope that someone could help me simplify it.
&gt;I tried to simplify it myself. And what happened? &gt;I should understand while and for loops. Yes you should. Have you read the documentation on for loops? &gt;I enjoy learning and I would hope that someone could help me simplify it. If you enjoy learning you do t need somebody to do it for you. We're trying to help you learn how to do it yourself. &gt;I shouldn't have to list every single combination within the function. You shouldn't. So don't!
I'm going to be honest I have Narcolepsy for one and I got very sick this semester. I wound up on antibiotics and have oral candidiasis. This homework is due Tuesday. I have a lot on my plate and need help.
You can explore this by using the gabor class, which provides a lower level of control and insight into the filtering that imgaborfilt is doing. The Wavelength parameter is proportional to the support of the filter kernel in the spatial domain. You can use the "SpatialKernel" property of the gabor class to examine the spatial extent of the filters. &amp;#x200B; K&gt;&gt; g = gabor(\[5 10\],0); K&gt;&gt; K&gt;&gt; g &amp;#x200B; g = &amp;#x200B; 1×2 gabor array with properties: &amp;#x200B; Wavelength Orientation SpatialAspectRatio SpatialFrequencyBandwidth SpatialKernel &amp;#x200B; K&gt;&gt; size(g(1).SpatialKernel) &amp;#x200B; ans = &amp;#x200B; 81 81 &amp;#x200B; K&gt;&gt; size(g(2).SpatialKernel) &amp;#x200B; ans = &amp;#x200B; 159 159
That was really helpful. If I may ask, why is the size of g(1).SpatialKernel 81\*81? I want a specific kernel size (5\*5) and I cant figure out how. I just tested the size for the lowest allowed Wavelength value (=2) and the kernel size is 19\*19. Is it possible to make it smaller than this value?
It doesn't look like you're using 'tf' properly. The documentation shows the numerator and denominator as separate inputs: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html) Try: G = tf(numg,deng);
at line 8, when you define G with the function `tf([numg,deng])` \- you're concatenating your numerator with the denominator. Instead, the arguments should be separate without the brackets. The brackets create a single vector that `tf()` uses as a single input instead of two separate arguments defining the numerator and denominator.
Yeah, youre exactly right. Dumb error that I kept overlooking, I guess I was just typing too fast. Thank you!
Then it would probably be a good idea to answer the questions we're asking you.
Ok, I give up. I'm not asking you questions for fun, it's because you need to tell me what is wrong with something if I can help you fix it. You are pasting code into Reddit like we can see the matrix, which isn't how this works. If you've tried something and it didn't work, you have to tell me what it was so I can tell you *why* it didn't work and help you on the way to something new. But no one here will just open the code, dig around for 15 minutes and then go "well here's what I would do" Best advice I can give you for this. Matlab error messages are extremely meaningful, when it throws an error, we need to know what that error was to fix it. We physically cannot know your issues from our pcs.
[ii,jj] = find(A == min(A(:)))
you can use these functions: min, find, ind2sub, and the (:) operator
You can skip the 'find' function by calling min with two outputs. The second output will be the index of the minimum value.
If you solve someones homework question for them, you'll rob them of an opportunity to learn. Therefore it's better to help someone solve their problem then to solve it for them.
I think that's true in most cases. However, in a forum-like format like reddit, there's issues with availability and response time. Especially for a problem as simple as this. The MATLAB "help" command can help the user understand the commands used. Additionally, OP said that they're doing a question where having this information would be useful, so it's not like I've solved the entire problem for them. I've given them a tool that will help them solve the rest of the problem. Sometimes that's what you need. I know that when I was in college, I absolutely hated when someone gave me a "teach him how to fish" kind of answer. It works well when you've got an hour to spare, totally dedicated to helping them arrive at the solution, but on reddit, it just doesn't work well. People have other things to do.
Ahhh fantastic! exactly what i needed haha, been trying to use \[Y, I\] = min(...) all this time and making such a meal out of it.
You may want to look at the comet3() function.
Maybe he thinks we're actually *part of Matlab*? No, sir, I don't work here. I'm just shopping in the same store. Please stop yelling at me about your coupons.
Great! Yes, what's happening in the case of [Y,I] = min(A) is: Y = [1 0 3] I = [1 2 1] In this case, [1 0 3] are the minimum elements of each column. [1 2 1] are their respective indices within those column vectors. So Y(1) = 1, which is the first element of the column vecotr [1;4;7]. Y(2) = 0, which is the second element of the column vecotr [2;0;8]. Y(3) = 3, which is the first element of the column vector [3;6;9].
Generally, laptops can't have their GPUs switched out. As for getting a non-gaming laptop, that might be a difficult one. CUDA is a technology made by Nvidia, whose main business is video gaming graphics. The majority of a laptops with CUDA cores are gonna be gaming laptops. There exist laptops with CUDA that are designed for business use, but they are usually quite a bit more expensive. [Here's](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1334987-REG) and [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1470604-REG) is one one the high end. I'd look online for mobile workstations with Nvidia GPUs that match your price point.
I don't get that variable when I load gong.mat. Are you sure it wasn't already in your workspace? I'm using 2014a, in case there's some version dependence.
If you are doing work that needs serious computing power, you really don't want to be using a laptop.
\+1. It's going to add a lot of cost for the same specs that you could get on a desktop PC. Plus with a PC, you have complete control over your GPU.
Thanks for the suggestions! I'll probably go with the 1st one, 4k is a bit out of my price range. Much obliged!
that's a good point, mobility is more important than constantly utilizing high computing power to me right now. I honestly hadn't even considered a desktop, but I'll look into it before deciding. Thanks
You can get a laptop that's good for mobility, or a desktop with a lot of power; or you can spend a lot more money to get a laptop that will be worse for both mobility and computing power than either of the first two options. Of course, you're not spending your own money on this, right? It's being paid for by your employer/university department, right? So get a beefy desktop PC and a nice portable laptop, and connect to the PC with remote desktop.
I can't speak for the value of either machines. I think that GPU is a bit old for the first one (Maxwell architecture, which is from 2 generations or 5 years ago). I'm not too familiar with Nvidia's workstation products, I'm much more familiar with their consumer (gaming) chips. The gaming cards (GTX and RTX) cards essentially the same as the workstation cards (Quadro, etc.). The only difference is really the drivers, which affect stability and a bit of optimization. So I'd say don't disclude the idea of getting a gaming laptop with an GTX or RTX card, some companies have some "regular," not gaudy looking laptops. Lenovo's Ideapad lineup had some nice, well priced laptops with GTX 1050s and 1050Ti's but I don't think they're selling those models anymore. Btw, [here's](https://browser.geekbench.com/cuda-benchmarks) a benchmark that I found for CUDA compute.
If you are at a university, you may have access to a high power computing server. If that is the case, you would be able to run your code faster than you ever could with a desktop or a laptop.
I don't get it either. 2017b.
Ah, forgot my clear vars. Was working with some sample data at an unholy hour of the night and forgot I didn’t close that instance. I’m a dummy. Thanks!
Nor do I. OP, are you sure it was an audio file you loaded? There are a lot of \*.mat files included with Matlab, it's very likely that some contain an \`x\` variable, but unlikely to be one of the audio-only files.
In the code you posted, when did you expect the `for` loop to run? I hope the answer is "never". If that's not the first answer that came to mind, you've got some thinking to do. If you swap the position of the loops, the `while` loop will do *something*, just not anything related to the display of cards. The `for` loop will handle the cards as usual, and then the `while` loop will do its thing. I see that you've already used one nested loop... and that's probably enough hints for a homework problem. ;)
I'd suggest an XPS 15. The current version can be specced with a 1050Ti which is a pretty decent card, but it's also reasonably portable. I have the previous gen (9560) with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, and it's pretty rapid. That said, I don't use it as my main machine for CUDA workflows, but it's great for when I'm on the move and need to try something locally. &amp;#x200B; That first machine does indeed have a dedicated GPU, but it's not a terribly strong performer. The 1050Ti has more cores and a higher clock speed, and is based on a newer architecture (Pascal vs Maxwell). You'd also probably want to upgrade to 16GB RAM, and in this day and age would \*absolutely\* want to upgrade to an SSD.
Well it's not a specific homework problem, I came upon myself to add a timer and it is not required by any means. The project is to create a game aid of any kind for any type of board/card game. In regards to the for loop, I'm not sure what you mean. If I take out all of the while loop stuff I'm left with a GUI that runs through n cards when I press the Start Practice button. Without the for loop, the cards do not cycle and it display's one card and then clears the axes, the for loop prevents this and continuously randomly selects cards to display.
The user enters a time interval merely for their own skill level. The better they are, the smaller the time interval they will input. The timer is only there as a graphical representation to show them how much time they have left before the card will change.
Sure, I understand what you're trying to do and what each block of code's responsibility is. You're very close to getting it to work the way you want, you just need to combine some ideas you've already used. I'll add some **emphasis** to my first comment to help you find your answer.
Thanks, if I get it to work it'll be much more advanced than the rest of the class. We haven't even learned about while loops yet.
Nope, this is out of my pocket. I've got a no frills tiny "desktop" in my office, but it's pretty useless. I am able to use matlab through the university's servers, but it's pretty slow and I'm only allotted so much use per month
I originally had the GUI working off of user input only. The card would change if they pressed +1, -1, or 0 but I decided to make it more autonomous.
I do, I can work through their computing cluster, but my processing time is limited per month, and i honestly didn't find it to be that much faster. but maybe i'm not using it right.
Very cool! [Here's a cheat sheet for you](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/while.html), direct from MathWorks (the folks who make MATLAB). Even the first sentence on the page should be hugely helpful in understanding why what you've written doesn't work! The documentation is absolutely fantastic overall, and I highly recommend keeping a browser window with it open (that, or the Help Browser in MATLAB) at all times. You're so close you probably won't need it, but best of luck to you!
Thanks, I'll take a look
I also use a university’s cluster. For my research I just used parfor and parallelized the my code. While this is cpu based, it plays to the strengths of the cluster. My university’s cluster does have some great GPUs you can use too, but I have found, at least for my research, that GPUs are far slower than just using the CPUs.
It's definitely possible, but would require a lot of work. You would have to define the shape using various lines to create new shapes, and build arrays to represent those in the inertial space you're viewing, as well as having to rotate and translate all those points. If this is something you want to pursue, look up the hgtransform function: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hgtransform.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hgtransform.html) &amp;#x200B; And then to shortcut the creation of the ISS graphing object, you can use a function someone on the exchange created: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22409-stl-file-reader?s\_tid=mwa\_osa\_a](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22409-stl-file-reader?s_tid=mwa_osa_a) where all you need is an stl file and it generates the faces and vertices for you. And if you need an stl file for the ISS, here you go: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17114/files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17114/files) (use the Assembled\_ISS.stl file), and run that (instead of the included femur.stl file) through the stldemo file that you get when downloading off mathworks.
I ve been looking at laptop for deep learning. I was requested to choose in the 'pro' series and not in the gamer one. The best card that I could find were barely equivalent of a rtx 1060. I end up with a special external case with a graphic card inside. I think it's from asus. There are several version of busses. It is designed for gamers. I assume it can handle deep learning as well. As I need several of them, I will benchmark with a classical tower connected to net using fiber optic Lan. I can then use a distance connexion from the laptop or the Matlab computing toolbox.
By the way, it is often more easier to use the following syntax: s=tf('s') ; F=(s+1)/(s-10)/(s-5);
By the way, it is often more easier to use the following syntax: s=tf('s') ; F=(s+1)/(s-10)/(s-5);
I had to do this for a matlab test for one of my engr classes and ended up using a loop cause that was the only way I could figure out out and didn't have time to do it a better way.
Can you post your code so far? I'm having a hard time following your description.
Can do later but right now im on the bus home. For now i basically have two sets of data vectors, with the x axis being frequencies and the y axis being amplitudes. So i did bar(x,y), and now each bar has a width of 5 hz. Id like to decrease this width so that maybe each frequency gets its own distinct bar in the bar plot if that makes sense.
As far as I'm aware, `bar` plots exactly many bars as you provide data points. It shouldn't be compressing the data into fewer bars. So long as x and y have data for each frequency, `bar` will plot that number of bars. It may be a problem with your x and y vectors.
Hmm. I checked the size of them and both had 128 members, but i only had likw 30 bars. Ill check again though thanks.
It's less than ideal, but you could plot each (Frequency,Amplitude) pair using the line function. All you'd have to do is reshape the data slightly and make sure it's in a row vector. You'd end up with something like this: &amp;#x200B; `frequency = [f1,f2,f3,...];` `amplitude = [a1,a2,a3,...];` `x = repmat(frequency,2,1); % keep the x coordinates equal to plot vertical lines` `y = [zeros(size(amplitude)); amplitude]; % vary the y coordinates from 0-amplitude` `line(x,y) % you can vary the color and width using the name, value pair options` &amp;#x200B; This is not an elegant solution, but it should work.
Sometimes when things aren't behaving how I think they should, I do a simple one and see if that works. If that works, then I know it's my data that's messed up. So, for instance try: x = 1:10; y = rand(1,10); bar(x,y); And make sure you get 10 bars, evenly spaced, all amplitudes between 0 &amp; 1. If that doesn't work, then you know you probably have some other problem, like you've accidently re-defined 'bar' away from the default values. If that works, then you know it's probably a problem with your input data (aka- it's not what you think). For example, does your data have 'nans' that you're not expecting? Does your 'x' have repeated values? Etc.
Look into the reshape function, which should be very helpful.
If you're doing research, it might be worth applying for an allocation on their cluster. Normally it's as simple as writing a 2-3 page justification for what you plan to do and how many hours of computational time you'll need.
The 1050 Ti is a Pascal so its pretty close to a P2000 in the Thinkpads. The best Pascal was the P3200 in the P52 thinkpad and the P6000 in the P72. The P3200 is roughly a geforce 1060 or 1070 and the P6000 is well beyond any geforce. The P72 does have a big selection of cards in between. The X1 Extreme has a 1050 Ti like the XPS 15 and the P1 has the quadro equivalent, the P1000 or P2000. The P51 and P71 have Maxwell cards which were previous generation. I would not go that old for GPUs. There are no Volta or RTX gen cards for thinkpads yet, afaik. Not sure if they reached other laptops.
Please dont dump a bunch of money into a laptop just to utilize cuda. Build a desktop and remote into it with tour laptop. Another choice is apple with their external GPU tech, but official support is limited to AMD.
I'm not sure what you're after here. In particular, I don't see how a 10x10x3 array of coordinates isn't *already* a 10x10 array of length-3 vectors. Maybe the easiest way to clarify would be to give us an example (even if speculative as to the exact syntax) of the code you'd like to be able to run *after* doing this data transformation.
You already have a 10x10 matrix of 1x3 vectors... it's all in how you look at it: my3vec = reshape(myTenTenThree(1, 1, :), [1, 3]); If you want to arrange the vectors in something other than a matrix, a [cell array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cell.html) would work.
 I just need to reformat it into a data format I can display easily as a table, it's a just a set of coordinates which corresponds to 2 other parameters. So I don't need to run any code directly with it, just be able to export it in a matter which I could then paste into a table in a different program.
Sounds like you want a 100x3 array?
+ That would certainly be better than what I've got, the issue is that the data corresponds to 2 parameters. It's the result of a function which takes in said parameters and spits out a coordinate in 3-space. So I run the function at (1,1) and put the 3 resulting coor dinates into the slots 1,1,1:3 so ideally I'd keep the coordinates in the corresponding positions.
Well unless you have a 3 dimensional piece of paper, you can only write a table of values with 2 dimensions. You could always add extra columns to display the input parameters. In other words, if you have (x, y, z) = f(a, b), your table would be 100x5 where each row is [a, b, x, y, z].
 [x,y]=meshgrid(1:10); % the parameters z = randn(10,10,3); % fake data, obviously! [x(:), y(:), reshape(z,100,3)] % the output table.
+
this is all great, thanks for the ideas, you've got me some stuff to look into. I appreciate the advice.
Cool, thanks I'll look into this as well. I'm learning so much today!
I'll see if my school has that and what to do about it. Much obliged.
Maybe he just want to retire the last coordinate: A 10x10x3 matrix can be cut along any dimension: A=rand([10,10,3]); X=A(:, :, 1); Y=A(:, :, 2); Z=A(:, :, 3); When you do this, you get 10x10x1 matrices. Obviously the last dimension is useless and most of the time unwanted. So you can clean up things a little bit using: X=squeeze(X) ; Y=squeeze(Y); Z=squeeze(Z); You end up with three clean matrices.
can you fix your post and post the entire diagnostic report?
As stated in the documentation, medfilt2 does **not** return the average of the values with the 3x3 neighborhood of the center pixel. Instead, it returns the median.
&gt;`data_structure=cell(length(num_sounds),3); I'm guessing this gives you a cell array of the wrong size. Is `num_sounds` a scalar? Also, it's super confusing to call this "_structure" when it's a cell array that contains structs. &gt;`for i=1:num_sounds;` Yup looks like `num_sounds` is a scalar. If it's not, then this for loop shouldn't work. Also, in Matlab i = j = sqrt(-1), so it's a bad habit to use i or j as loop indices. &gt; &gt;`wavPATH=fullfile(sound_dirs{i}, '*.wav'); % fullfile(Ball, '*.wav'); &lt;-- gives specified path` &gt; &gt;`wavLIST=dir(wavPATH); %saves .wav files in a struct call wavs_in_dir` &gt; &gt;`data_structure{i,2}=wavLIST;` &gt; &gt;`data_structure{i,1}=words{i};` Are the directory paths stored in `words{}` or `sound_dirs{}`? It looks like you have two variables with the same information. That's not a good idea. &gt; &gt;`end %all raw data saved into data_structure` &gt; &gt;`%% data_structure{i,3} holds the processed data &lt;-- Formants` &gt; &gt;`for i=1:num_sounds;` &gt; &gt;`NUMwavs=numel(data_structure{i,2});` &gt; &gt;`ith_file=data_structure{i,2};` &gt; &gt;`formants(1:NUMwavs)=struct('F1',[],'maxPxx1', [], 'F2',[],'maxPxx2',[], 'F3', [], 'maxPxx3', []);` Think about what this line will do on the second iteration through the loop.
No. &gt;f=fft(y); &gt; &gt;\[ind,\~\] = find(f&gt;=3500); What do you think this line is telling you? What do the values of `f` represent? Do you understand what the Fourier transform is doing? &gt; &gt;load handel.mat Okay, now you're loading an audio example file? Why? &gt;filename = 'handel.wav'; &gt; &gt;audiowrite(filename,c,fs); &gt; &gt;clear c fs What? What do you think these lines are doing?
`words { }` is a cell of the directory names and `sound_dirs { }` is a cell of the directory paths, so there's not an overlap there &amp;#x200B; `formants(1:NUMwavs)=struct('F1',[],'maxPxx1', [], 'F2',[],'maxPxx2',[], 'F3', [], 'maxPxx3', []);` `NUMwavs` never changes, so the program retains the same info for the unerased rows of the struct? I had a different problem when I did this: `formants(j)=struct('F1',[],'maxPxx1', [], 'F2',[],'maxPxx2',[], 'F3', [], 'maxPxx3', []);` `data_structure{i,3}=formants;` Where I only saved the last j terms.
Loops do not clear their variables between iterations. If you assign the first 47 elements of `formants` on iteration 1, what happens when you allocate the first 27 elements again on iteration 2? What size will `formants` be at that point? If you're still not sure, you could set a breakpoint on that line and watch what happens in the debugger.
Thanks. Fixed it. I realized that the second issue was because I set the equality too early. `data_structure{i,3}=formants;` should exist outside the end of the inner loop.
&gt;`data_structure{i,3}=formants;` &gt; &gt;should exist outside the end of the inner loop. Yes it should, but that won't alter the result, only the efficiency of the computation.
Thank you for your reply How to fix? The “#” enlarge the word And the report is very long In short it is fail to generate all binary outputs
I didn't read your code, but you can assign fields or sub-structures using this notation, which allows for programmatic naming and assignment -&gt; &amp;#x200B; structName = struct(); fieldname = 'someString'; structName.(fieldname) = struct;
I'de recommend this doc page: [https://nl.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html](https://nl.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html) the first section (Indexing Vectors) shows you a trick you can use to solve your problem. If you read it and feel like you understand it, but can;t solve your problem, explain to me what example you think you need to addapt for your problem in order to solve it, and why you think it still isn't working
Tagging along to this post. OP, you need to make sure you understand what the FFT returns. The FFT returns “[bins](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/26927/what-is-a-frequency-bin) ”, not frequencies. You need to perform a computation on the return values of the FFT to convert them from bins to frequency values.
I think that the student you're talking to is incorrect. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18395692/concatenating-matrix-in-matlab-results-in-loss-of-precision) for a similar discusison. The precision is there, but you might not see it unless you ask for it.
Sidebar
I'm relatively new to Matlab too but recently did a project with a multiclass SVM. When you create the classifier, you can pass the feature vectors and labels as parameters. Try having a look at the matlab page for [fitcsvm](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitcsvm.html). (That's the binary svm)
So for example (rough pseudo code similar to mine). For me as I'm classifying people I use an integer representing the person, but your label will be one of the labels for either cancerous or non-cancerous. trainingFeatures(featureCount,:) = extractHOGFeatures(I,'CellSize',HOGcellsize); trainingLabel{featureCount} = int2str(person); classifier = fitcsvm(trainingFeatures, trainingLabel);
Hey thank you so much I'll try this
Hope it helps! Obviously replace extractHOGFeatures with whatever feature extraction method you're using! If you have large feature vectors and you find it's super slow you may want to look at [PCA](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/pca.html#d117e619846)
Matlab's website has guides and examples for each function which will be very useful when you get to using the actual ODE functions. Just type "doc functionname" In the command window, without the quotation marks.
I've never heard that before... You can check this pretty easily if you pre-allocate your array with, for example zeros: `a = zeros(1, 50000);` and then type `whos a` it should show something like this: `Name Size Bytes Class Attributes` `a 1x50000 400000 double` Showing that the default type / class of the zeros is still a 64 bit double (8 bytes, like you said). If you're losing, "precision," maybe it's because he's viewing it in the command window with a short `format`...? I'm pretty sure the default type / class will always be double.
There is a [Library for regular PID](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/). About the filtered derivative probably you can change the code so it does what you want, specifically the "compute" function which does the pid calculation which is [here](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/blob/master/PID_v1.cpp) and seems pretty basic compared to some other libraries
"Function ***definitions*** are not permitted in this context." This is a function file named SFPI.m, correct? If not, it should be. You're fine to have multiple functions in a single file, whether it is a function or script (as of r2016b). When nested, they should be closed with an `end` statement.
A double is a double. If you specifically try to concatenate, for example, a double and an 8-bit integer, then the output will be an array of 8-bit integers (i.e. precision will be lost). So, he's right when considering different data types, and he's wrong when considering general case with the default data type of double (which is what you get when you use `zeros`). To double check that this is correct, try `class(zeros(3))`. [More info available here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/concatenation-examples.html).
Kind of. The values returned by the fft are complex amplitudes.
You’re correct - I should have specified that the indices of the vector those amplitudes are returned in are the bins, not the values themselves.
That's is hilariously wrong.
 [https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/ug/add-lcd-library.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/ug/add-lcd-library.html) This article shows detailed steps on how to create the add-on yourself. This is probably the easiest way to go about this problem.
I’ve gotten as far as creating a string that says, ‘PHMWMH123456’. I can’t think of a way to make the string become ‘P1H2M3W4M5H6’.
The problem is that I have a few string with different numbers of elements that do this so I need to come up with some general code that will accept any string of this format and out put what I need.
I wouldn't really call them "bins". That implies some sort of accumulation into finite ranges, as in a histogram. That is not what an fft is doing. The n-th element of the transform output contains the amplitude of the frequency component with n-1 cycles over the duration of the input array to fft (or an array of the padded input length, if the optional padding argument is used). There is no "binning", it simply outputs the result of the finite summation which defines the discrete Fourier transform.
look at the matrix dimensions in debug and try figure out why they are not the same length.
The Problem with this Library is that you need to change your control parameters if you change your sample time. You need to manually add a timefactor to your I and D value. An other problem is that it doesn't take long code runtime into account.. If your code needs longer to run then your sampletime it will still use your sampletime to compute the new value and not your runtime. But if your application isn't very timesensitiv then you should be fine.
You can generate C code from your Matlab-File. https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-joy-of-generating-c-code-from-matlab.html Also take a look at this: https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-matlab.html
Combine the example in the link i send you after the text :" By using an indexing expression on the left side of the equal sign, you can *replace* certain elements of the vector:" with the example after "Combine the colon operator and end to achieve a variety of effects, such as extracting every k-th element or flipping the entire vector:"
maybe you have to add the extension? like "2mm.stl"
it uses millis which takes into account runtime, but it's true that it doesn't account for different sample time.
Try prefixing your lines of code with 4 spaces here to have them formatted properly. Your diagnostic report contains information useful for debugging, either you learn to read it or you stick it here.
figured out to use flip(B) instead of fliplr(B)
You need to take those "hold on"s off. If you didn't hold off it's not going to move on to the next figure
Correct me if I'm wrong but i think it only uses millis to check if the sampleTime is already passed but calculates still with the fix sample Time and not with the actual runtime
i have tried that, sadly it didnt work.
I have to say, I have always thought it was relatively easy to install. It takes a bit of time but wasn't all that difficult. And why should it be free?
Top quality troll post.
It should be free because the competition, things like Julia and Python, are free. Also open-source stuff generally works a lot better.
Lol. Why out of 7?
https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/regionprops.html?s_tid=doc_ta
Well, I imagine as long as they are an industry standard, not a lot will change.
That nested if statement gave me cancer.
Are you sure you have the name right and you're in the right directory? Type `dir` and see if your file shows up in the list.
&gt;I’ve been able to skate by these past weeks without using or getting familiar with Matlab. &gt;Trying to solve ODEs using Matlab is still very difficult for me. Shocking. &gt;Is there any tutorials out there that will help me understand using MatLab? Have you tried the Matlab documentation? Just press F1.
It’s more like you pay for Simulink and all other tool boxes.
Octave is free if you want a similar language. If Matlab were free, I doubt Mathworks would be able to make money to pay the developers who are constantly writing new libraries and improving the existing API. The installation process is easy, I don't know what you're talking about there. A lot needs to be downloaded because... there's a lot of data and it has to get to you somehow? I don't even get how that's a complaint. If you install every toolbox available it's going to be a lot of stuff. It is not restricted to academia. In fact, it's probably less prevalent in academia than industry. It's heavily used in many engineering fields - I know first hand it's essentially a standard in a big chunk of the aerospace and automotive industries. Open source is great - the first language I learned was python, and I was a Gentoo Linux developer for years - but in my environment at work? There's huge value in having a customer/vendor relationship with Mathworks. I don't have to scour the internet for 3rd party libraries to do what I need. If there's a problem, I have a phone number for paid, professional tech support. There's no (well, fewer) concerns about vetting code before introducing it to a secure network. All of the API functions are written in a consistent and compatible style, and *everything* is documented in excellent detail, and again, in a consistent manner. If you don't value those things, you're free to use Python, Julia (lol talk about niche), R, or whatever else. There's not a lot of point to complaining that something you aren't forced to use doesn't fit your needs.
oh yeah, i get what you mean now
Is this post meant to be sarcastic? How is Matlab difficult to install? It involves entering the license and clicking next a few times. At most you select what you want to install in custom installation. That's......as easy as it gets. Also, show me an open source software that is as extensive as Matlab.
You could download some coordinate maps from http://www.naturalearthdata.com/ and then import them into MATLAB. I'm not really experienced in line-polygon intersections but I'm guessing you could load that data into a bunch of `polyshape` objects, then create vectors with a bunch of points along the lines connecting your A and B coordinates. You can then iterate through the countries and see if they intersect with the lines using `isinterior`.
I'm not entirely sure what "solving" an ODE entails in your class, but I would recommend looking into the Symbolic Math Toolbox documentation.
&gt; using Matlab for the first time And it shows.
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/57
"Experienced software developer" ... hmmm
Not sure what you are asking, but I'm guessing your issue has to do with the input being treated as a double instead of a string. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/input.html
&gt;Also, show me an open source software that is as extensive as Matlab. OP is nuts, but to be fair, open source languages have staggeringly huge libraries. You can do a Google search and find 10 Python libraries for the niche problem that's only of interest to people who are doing a PhD on the same topic as you. In a way that's a good thing about Python, but it's also a downside that is one of the reasons to use something like Matlab - those 10 libraries are all in different states of development; some have better or worse documentation; some use python primitive data types, others have extensive class hierarchies to define their data types; some implement some of the features you need but not all - time to become a code contributor! Hope you have time for that! - and overall there's no guide, no way to know which one you want to use or what might happen to its development/support community a year or two after you commit to it. Like I said in my other post, I love open source, and the libraries for open source languages are easily as big as the Matlab collection of toolkits, but that's not the whole story. There are good reasons why something like Matlab is preferable in certain environments, and its library is absolutely one of those reasons.
I think that translates to "first year grad student who wrote some code for a class project as an undergraduate last year".
I’m going to try it today.
Ugh... i was comparing this code to my previous ones for hours and never noticed the ‘s’ in my previous codes... Thanks for the help, now I’m embarrassed lol such a simple thing
I’m going to try it today.
Yeah good points. I'm salty because I am being forced to use it
No, it actually translates to working as a full stack web developer for several years, and then coming back to academia.
Hmm software engineer has trouble with Matlab installation
Mathworks did substantially change their licensing model a few years ago. I doubt they would have done that if they weren't feeling some sort of pressure.
I know they released relatively cheap Home and Student licences, I always assumed that had more to do with the number of 'cracked' versions running around the Internet. If you lower the prices for those users, you might get a few more to buy, rather than use an illegal version.
"Also open-source stuff generally works a lot better." Not with python. Never tried Julia, but Matlab is considerably less bug free in my experience than python and its relevant libraries.
the [reshape](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/reshape.html) function lets you do that.
[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/reshaping-and-rearranging-arrays.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/reshaping-and-rearranging-arrays.html) Not working for you?
You are comparing Matlab to a programming language. It is not. It is a tool that has scripting abilities, and serves different purposes that you are used to. It's like driving a sports car, and then complaining that a crane truck doesn't go as fast. It indeed doesn't. It isn't supposed to, even though they both are cars and can drive along roads.
What do you mean - less or more bugs with matlab than python?
I've been using reshape but it doesn't work the way I want
I'm a bit confused as to what you wish to accomplish but this may help : &gt;&gt; B = [A(:, :, 1) ; A(:, :, 2) ; A(:, :, 3)]; If that does not meet your requirements please provide more details
It isn't just that. It used to be that universities needed to manage their own licence server that only worked on their network. If you wanted to work from home or have a computer not connected to the network, you either need to buy your own licence or use VPN. The applied to both students but also labs, and labs had to pay full price. When academics started switching to other things due to the cost and complexity a few years ago, mathworks began offering a new license scheme. In this scheme, universities pay for a certain number of simultaneous users, with they licenses managed by mathworks own servers. No license server is needed, students, faculty and staff can use it, the computer can be anywhere in the world with no VPN needed, and the computer only needs to be connected to the network once every few months. There is no reason they couldn't have offered this scheme earlier, they only did it when they started getting serious competition. And it isn't about piracy, that has always been an issue.
A graphical explanation perhaps is better. See the picture related. What I want to do is put the pages in one plane, the same way you would arrange sheets of paper vertically in a table rather than stacking them. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/matlab/win64/nddemo\_02.gif](https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/matlab/win64/nddemo_02.gif)
If your matrix a, is of dimension lxmxN, then type: a=reshape (a,l,m*N) This will stack each plane column wise (from left to right) Taking the transpose of a, will stack the planes row wise
**(Posting as MathWorks employee)** &amp;#x200B; May I ask what you're using Julia for? Do you collect test coverage on your Julia code?
but what I want to get is a NXM matrix, not a 3D array
No worries! Happy to help. Don't worry: I've been there.
This will give you a 2d array with size l x (m*N).
Yes sorry, I think I already tried it but I'll give it a go
TIL the origin of 5/7
It sounds like you need to use a combination of the [permute](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/permute.html) and [reshape](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/reshape.html) functions. You can think of any array as being stored as a pair: (1) a single column vector of data and (2) a size indicator that lets you index into the data. The ‘reshape’ function only changes the size indicator. So, ‘m1=1:12’ and ‘m2=reshape(m1,[3,4])’ will be equal as column vectors ‘all(m1(:)==m2(:))’. But, ‘permute’ will reorder the column vector of data. Thus, ‘m3=permute(m2,[2,1])’ will not have the same column vector ‘~all(m1(:)==m3(:))’. Note that for 2D arrays like ‘m1’, ‘m2’, and ‘m3’, ‘permute(m,[2,1])’ is equivalent to the ‘transpose’ function. It sounds like that if the pages aren’t stacked like you want, then you need to reorder the data first with ‘permute’ TL;DR: try first using ‘permute’, maybe ‘permute(m,[1,3,2])’
Use NOT?
Welcome to the wonderful world of differential equations! Definitely check out the Documentation for examples. Not sure if you're ready yet, but check out the page on ode45.
Perfect bro exactly what I was looking for thank you loads
lol yeah, could try and do stuff with the and but that always seems to glitch out on me so I just prefer to do one of those nested if statements
not sure how that helps
Cool! Unexpectedly learned something new today
Can you describe a little bit more how you want this to look?
It's a bit hard without seeing the size of the variables in there (e.g. what is `x2`?). For starters, I would recommend learning how to set breakpoints. Click on the line number next to the line fitRes = fit(x2,I1,myfitD,'StartPoint',[0,0],'Algorithm','Levenberg-Marquardt'); And check your workspace variables for the sizes. For starters, the `diff` function computes the difference between adjacent values, but it looks like `diff` is the name of your data matrix--you should rename it to something else so it doesn't overshadow the `diff` function. So your `I1` variable should be a 6-by-1 vector. Make sure `x2` is the same size: 6-by-1 (not transposed i.e. 1-by-6, this can screw up fitting functions). Also, you're `Exclude` input argument will return a 1-by-1-by-6 array. You should probably call `squeeze` on your excluded argument. So to be safe, try calling this: fitRes = fit(x2(:),I1,myfitD,'StartPoint',[0,0],'Algorithm','Levenberg-Marquardt', 'Exclude', squeeze(I1(i,j,:,k)&gt;I1(i,j,1,k)); If that doesn't work, try transposing `x2(:)` and `I1`. If that doesn't work, we'll need more information on your variable sizes.
Why not just create an intermediate matrix that excludes those values? Something like: I_filtered = I1(I1&lt;=I1(i,j,1,k) &amp; I1&gt;=I1(i,j,6,k)) ? Check that syntax though cause I'm on my phone
Paste is not `ctrl+y`, it's `ctrl+v`. You must have somehow overridden window's shortcut keys. Second, Matlab uses `ctrl+pgUp` and `ctrl+pgDown` to cycle between open files.
This is completely incorrect, unless your preallocated array has less precision than the values being assigned. In other words: y = zeros(5e4,1); % preallocate double array for i = 1:5e4 a = get_double_value(); % retrieve some value a from somewhere y(i) = a; end y2 = []; for i = 1:5e4 a = get_double_value(); % retrieve some value a from somewhere y2 = [y2;a]; end `y` and `y2` are identical.
`Y = squeeze(num2cell(shiftdim(X,2),1));`
&gt; OP is nuts, but to be fair, open source languages have staggeringly huge libraries. You can do a Google search and find 10 Python libraries for the niche problem that's only of interest to people who are doing a PhD on the same topic as you. But 8/10 don't work anymore, 1/10 only works in python 2, and the last one has terrible documentation.
Yeah, I want 4 plots. 3d plot F1: F2: F3 2d plot F1: F2 2d plot F1: F3 2d plot F2:F3
Glitch out
It will do exactly what you asked for?
Nailed it.
He's on Linux. He's probably got some configuration issues in his window manager ir X11 configuration.
If you're a software developer running Linux, why are you trying to use ctrl-v to paste? Copy/paste is `esc, v, y, p`.
It looks like it's because in the final loop (when j == 7) you try to index K(j+1), which would be K(8) which probably doesn't exist. You're trying to access the 8th element in a 7-element array.
This was my first guess but its then decremented by 1. I've tried removing the j+1 but the counts for the words do not come out correctly. It gets the correct counts for the first 6 words but at the 7th I get this error. do you have any ideas? I could share my full code. It's just that I understand the issue, but it seems to be the only way to acquire the correct counts. I've really spent so many hours just reading through my code and I can't figure it out
Can you share a more complete example that we can try to run for ourselves? That would make troubleshooting a bit easier.
The extension itself doesn't matter -- it's only part of the filename really and doesn't change the contents. However, I'd question whether you're downloading the correct file if they're being saved as .html's. Are you able to share the code you have so far? Are the download files the correct size?
I only know how to use the websave() function for one file at a time, but for that one file, I have: url = 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/'; websave('QCLCD201601.zip', url) unzip('C:\Users\Sam\Documents\Project 2 MATLAB\QCLCD201601.zip') Another part of the problem is that [QCLCD201601.zip](https://QCLCD201601.zip) contains several .txt files, and I'm unsure of how to isolate only the daily .txt file.
&gt; This was my first guess but its then decremented by 1. In the specified case, you have `K(8) - 1` not `K(8 - 1)`. If there are only 7 elements in `K`, this will fail, as the previous comment suggested.
OK so did my idea not work out for you?
Ah, I see. So, for `websave`, the first parameter is the filename *to be saved on your machine*. The second parameter is the *full* URL for the file you wish to download. So in your case, you should be using: url = 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/QCLCD201601.zip'; websave('QCLCD201601.zip', url) unzip('C:\Users\Sam\Documents\Project 2 MATLAB\QCLCD201601.zip') At the moment, you're downloading the HTML of the directory listing, rather than the zip itself. Appending the filename to the URL will cause the zip itself to be download. Hope this helps!
The algorithm should not depends on the language. Most of the language do not support vector indexing and such things, but the most standard way to deal with it is to use a loop. Alternatively you may use Matlab coder to have a look at the generated code. It should give you some implementation ideas.
What about making a system call to pdftex?
Just read it, confirmed, including examples.
Thank you! This gives me a good step in the right direction. o(^◇^)o
You can engine the system shell with bang, so for example typing: ! ls ~ So you can just call pdfLaTeX within a Matlab script.
Python's Numpy is an example of this, for both vectorisation and logical indexing.
As far as I know in Python, you have to import NumPy to use logical indexing. If you want to do it in original Python, you can do it with list comprehension.
Sorry, was unclear. Python (numpy, scipy and so) have more bugs.
I'm going to post a few example code snippets for you to try that will (hopefully) help demonstrate why you aren't getting the result you expect, and show you what you can try. For each of these, I've first defined a few example vectors that I'm using: F1 = rand(1,5); F2 = rand(1,5); F3 = rand(1,5); Now consider the following three methods for creating different plots: **Method 1** \- This is what you're currently doing (and it doesn't work) fh1 = figure(1); fh2 = figure(2); fh1; plot(F1,F2,'o'); hold on; fh2; plot(F1,F3,'o'); hold on; **Method 2** \- This is probably what I would do myself fh1 = figure(1); plot(F1,F2,'o'); hold on; fh2 = figure(2); plot(F1,F3,'o'); hold on; **Method 3** \- This would also work just fine fh1 = figure(1); fh2 = figure(2); figure(fh1); plot(F1,F2,'o'); hold on; figure(fh2); plot(F1,F3,'o'); hold on; The reason that methods 2 and 3 work is that in order to plot into a given figure window (in my case, `fh1` and `fh2`), you need to make that window active. When you create a figure, that figure window is the currently active one, so in method 2, by calling `figure` and then calling `plot`, the plot gets put into the window that I'm interested in. I think method 3 is what you're trying to do: first you create all of the figure windows at the top of your code, and then you activate the window of interest before plotting. But notice the difference in syntax: in method 1, before the first plot I have `fh1;` but in method 3 I have `figure(fh1);`. When I created the figure with `fh1 = figure(1);`, the variable `fh1` is the *figure handle*, which is a variable that contains properties of the figure. If I call `fh1` on it's own (without the terminating semicolon), the command line will just print the variable contents: &gt;&gt; fh1 fh1 = Figure (1) with properties: Number: 1 Name: '' Color: [0.94 0.94 0.94] Position: [560 528 560 420] Units: 'pixels' Show all properties This is the same as if I type the name of any other variable. For example, &gt;&gt; F1 F1 = 0.73864 0.58599 0.24673 0.66642 0.083483 Having a semicolon on the end of the command suppresses the output, so calling `&gt;&gt; F1;` doesn't print anything on the command line. Similarly, `fh1;` is just suppresses the output of calling a variable. Because `fh1` is a variable, calling it doesn't not make the `figure(1)` window active! And that's why method 1 doesn't work. But if you look at the documentation of the figure command, it states: &gt;`figure(`[`f`](https://localhost:31515/static/help/matlab/ref/figure.html?overload=(matlab)%2Ffigure%2Bfalse&amp;snc=TLAZJX&amp;container=jshelpbrowser#buich1u-1-f)`)` makes the figure specified by `f` the current figure and displays it on top of all other figures. So by calling `figure(fh1);` I am making the window active. Note that this will also be true for things like making figure axes labels, legends, etc. Finally, one other point about your code in general: it should be possible to simplify it a bit by removing your inner for-loops. The first one (where you pre-allocate the arrays) is definitely not necessary: for n=1:num_pts; N=num2str(n); [F1pts]=zeros(1,num_pts); [F2pts]=zeros(1,num_pts); [F3pts]=zeros(1,num_pts); end Notice that you don't use the counting variable, `n`, anywhere inside the loop? You are just making and then re-making and overwriting the zero-vectors a bunch of times. I also think that it's possible to remove your second inner for-loop (though I could be wrong here; it's hard for me to test for sure without knowing what your data looks like). Try: `F1pts = [data{i,3}.F1];` and see if that give an error (or you might need to do `F1pts = [data{i,3}(:).F1];`). Then you wouldn't even need to per-allocate those arrays. So your code would look like (where I've also replaced plot with scatter): for i=1:num_sounds; F1pts = [data{i,3}.F1]; F2pts = [data{i,3}.F2]; F3pts = [data{i,3}.F3]; figure(Plot3D); scatter3(F1pts, F2pts, F3pts, colors(i)); hold on; figure(Plot2D_12); scatter(F1pts, F2pts, colors(i)); hold on; figure(Plot2D_13); scatter(F1pts, F2pts, colors(i)); hold on; figure(Plot2D_23); scatter(F1pts, F2pts, colors(i)); hold on; end
Many languages have vectorisation (though not C-like afaik), python fortran etc. . For logical indexing you could try for example the where statement in Fortran, there is presumably an equivalent in many languages. This is effectively the same as logical indexing.
You can use plot() along with abs() to plot the magnitude, angle() to plot the phase, real() to plot the real part, and imag() to plot the imaginary part.
It's not upper triangular because the else case assigns values to the lower part
Thanks I'll check it!
Yeah I1 and x2 are both 6x1. At your recommendation I changed diff to diff_final. I tried your squeeze method but that resulted in the same error: "Index exceeds matrix dimensions". I'm not sure if when it's "excluding" the value it's changing the matrix size during the fitting and that's what's causing the error? I'll attach the full-ish version of my code so it's a bit more clear. f3 = fopen('2dseq'); %loading in data A1=squeeze(fread(f3,'int16')); fclose(f3); FOV2 = [64 64 7 6]; % [read, phase, # of slices, bval] diffusion = squeeze(reshape(A1,[FOV2(1) FOV2(2) FOV2(3) FOV2(4)])); %setting up diffusion slices diff1 = squeeze(diffusion(:,:,3,:)); diff2 = squeeze(diffusion(:,:,4,:)); diff3 = squeeze(diffusion(:,:,5,:)); %slice by slice diff_final = cat(4,diff1,diff2,diff3); %organized by (:,:,Bval,slice) B_value_list = [15.876612 500.468114 750.056290 1000.912031 1501 3000.491886];%s/mm2 x2 = B_value_list; [n,m,~,o]=size(diff_final); dataCoeffd=zeros([n,m,o]); dataErrd=zeros([n,m,o]); myfitD = fittype(('b*exp(-x2*ADC)'),'independent',{'x2'},'coefficients',{'b','ADC'}); x2 = x2.'; for i = 1:n for j=1:m for k=1:o I1 = squeeze(diff(i,j,:,k)); fitRes = fit(x2,I1,myfitD,'StartPoint',[0,0],'Algorithm','Levenberg-Marquardt'); dataCoeffd(i,j,k)=fitRes.ADC; %plot(fitRes,x2,I1) end end end Any other ideas?
How do you make the .tex figures? I’m asking for my own curiosity. I make every figure then save it as a pdf from the figure window, but it sounds like your workflow is pretty cool.
This would be the equivalent of logical indexing: &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(higher-order_function) As for vectorization, you would use the equivalent of SIMD instructions. For compiled languages like C/C++, you could either rely on the compiler to implicitly vectorize your code, or explicitly using SSE/AVX intrinsic instructions. Even C# has SIMD-enabled vector types: &gt; https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Numerics.Vectors
Yea i know the loops are a solution but I was wondering if there were faster ways than using loops. &amp;#x200B; Matlab coder isn't a bad idea if one has a university license or $4000 dollars.
If using a compiled language, for loops are not usually much slower than vectorization - just more concise.
That sounds like what I’ve been looking for. I’ll give it a shot! I save all my figures as .png and pretty much use fprintf for a standard format to a .tex file. All that changes are the filenames, the name of the .tex file, and a few identifiers so I know what each LaTeX page represents.
See my response to /u/5uspect. It nothing super fancy at all. But it keeps all of my pages looking identical!
I’m so sorry dude, I can’t find that comment. Can you link it?
I’m so sorry dude, I can’t find that comment. Can you link it?
i see. good thing to keep in mind.

No built in functions?! Have fun coding in assembly instead.
I'm assuming you are referring to a PID controller. &amp;#x200B; PID, or **P**roportional **I**ntegral **D**erivative, is a type of controller that belongs to the realm of "classical control theory", wherein digital controllers mimic controllers originally created using analog circuits (that's how I learned, and I'm in my early 30s). That being said: PID is a tried-and-true approach in many cases. The goal of a PID controller is to drive the error term (the reference signal minus the sensed signal) to zero. In simpler terms: the controller wants the sensed variable (e.g. the temperature in a room) to match the desired value (e.g. 22 deg C). A good overview of PID is [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Fundamental_operation). One note: the Derivative term is often not used in practice because, unless properly tuned, the controller is susceptible to noise (as the Derivative component responds to the rate of change of the error signal). I also found, with minimal Googling, [an overview from the University of Michigan](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID#1).
The Matlab language was inspired by Fortran, which supports some very similar indexing strategies. Many of the programs I use have a user-interface built in Matlab or .Net, and a "core" built around compiled Fortran code, which can produce very well optimized executables. Due to the nature of the .Net system, it is likely that the C# program will not reach the same efficiencies as a compiled Fortran or C program. However, if efficiency is not the primary concern, you may find that F# is a good balance: it is possible to integrate F# and C# code in the same project, but F# provides a variety of interesting array indexing tools that are not available in C#.
The spikes exist when the tone "switches on." For example, if you take the spectrum of one of your tones, except have a moment of silence at the beginning, and then start the tone, there will be a spike. Can you find a way to "fade" the tone in? Multiply the first moments of the tone by a sort of "ramp" function that starts at 0, and linearly increases to 1 over some length of time?
To add to this, I'd also apply a ramping function to the tone offsets, as seen at 2 seconds.
Can a open courseware in feedback control help here?
Those are from jump discontinuities: if you plot the tones along the same axis as the spectrogram, you'll see a big jump right where those impulse spikes are. The reason for that is that an instantaneous big jump acts like an impulse, which has infinite bandwidth in the frequency domain; by appending without any regard for the phase of the previous wave, you're resetting at probably zero or one, depending on if it's sin or cos as the lowest harmonic (I can't tell if your signal is a single-harmonic sinusoid overlaid over a constant chord, or if there's some funky wave shaping). &amp;#x200B; The way I've always done this is to realize that 1) frequency is the derivative of phase, and 2) you can integrate little phase differentials with \`cumsum\` to produce a smoothed wave. &amp;#x200B; Here's an example, with far fewer discontinuities; you won't notice an audible pop. &amp;#x200B; close all freqs = \[ 100 , 100 \* 5/4 , 100 \* 4/3 , 100 \* 3/2 \] ; % Hz times = \[ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \]/2 ; % seconds &amp;#x200B; sampling\_frequency = 10e2 ; % 10 kHz T = 1 / sampling\_frequency ; time\_vec = min( times ) : ( 1 / sampling\_frequency ) : max( times ) ; &amp;#x200B; freq\_vec = zeros( size( time\_vec ) ) ; d\_phase = zeros( size( time\_vec ) ) ; &amp;#x200B; for i\_freq = 1 : numel( freqs ) current\_freq = freqs( i\_freq ) ; valid\_inds = ( time\_vec &gt;= times( i\_freq ) ) &amp; ... ( time\_vec &lt;= times( i\_freq + 1 ) ) ; disp( min( find( valid\_inds ) ) ) d\_phase( valid\_inds ) = current\_freq \* gradient( time\_vec( valid\_inds ) ) ; end &amp;#x200B; cumulative\_phase = cumsum( d\_phase ) \* ( 2\*pi ) ; tones = sin( cumulative\_phase ) ; &amp;#x200B; last\_crossing = find( gradient( sign( tones ) ) , 1 , 'last' ) ; tones( last\_crossing : end ) = 0 ; &amp;#x200B; figure sp(1) = subplot( 211 ) ; spectrogram( tones , hanning( 2\^7 ) , \[\] , 2\^10 , sampling\_frequency , 'yaxis' ) colorbar off ylim( \[ 0 , max( freqs ) \* 1.25 \] / 1 ) &amp;#x200B; sp(2) = subplot( 212 ) ; stairs( time\_vec( 1:end ) , ( tones ) ) grid on , axis tight &amp;#x200B; linkaxes( sp , 'x' ) sound( tones , sampling\_frequency ) &amp;#x200B; zoom xon &amp;#x200B; There's also a simple-ish patch you can do, if all of those tones are unit amplitude (normalize them from -1 to 1 if not): 1. Take your signal, run the \`arccos\` of it to get the phase of the sinusoid. 2. Take the gradient of this phase; plot it. You'll see spikes where the phase resets. 3. Figure out a way to get rid of those spikes (amplitude threshold and make it equal its neighbor, etc). 4. Cumsum the de-spiked result. 5. Take the \`cos\` of that.
Thank You so much for this detailed response. Will study this in detail.
I go to Purdue
+ Hi, thanks for the answer. I tried your second alternative, without doing step 3, just to see if I could work my way back to the original signal in step 5, as I can see step 2 being really useful for removing the spikes. What I did: signal = audioread('AE_FINAL.wav'); signal = normalize(signal, 'range', [-1 1]); phase = acos(signal); grad = gradient(phase); sum = cumsum(grad); result = cos(sum); if everything is done correctly, then "result" should be the same as "signal right"? The [plots](https://i.imgur.com/XeuaJjn.png) (left is "signal", right is "result") don't look similar though. Any idea why? The wave im using to create these tones has been manually shaped, and then filtered using different bandpass filters if that makes a difference. Thanks
+I will try that, thanks for the suggestion.
Let me know if you need further explaination on anything.
I don't understand the downvotes. This is a legitimate criticism of this common and absurd type of homework assignment.
This is a pretty basic question, which leads me to think you should definitely check out the [Matlab tutorials](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html). The third topic is array indexing, which is such a basic task you won't be able to use matlab without understanding how it works.
Thank you! I kept looking some more and answered my own question and did it just the same way!
Thanks for the help! It's been like 3 years since I had done any MATLAB and it was not coming back easily
Compiler can optimize a lot the loops thanks to new set of operations available in the processor that allows to treat a whole piece of memory in a single instruction. So in fine it does vecyorize some part of the code, as Matlab probably does. If you benchmark c++ and Matlab program, you will see that c++ is faster. So vectorization is only a Matlab thing to write more. Concise and faster code.
That is exactly what I needed, thank you and sorry for the silly question
Why not a vector format?
Vector format for the picture names? I could do that. At the time I was writing it I wanted to make sure I knew where each picture was.
Make sure to call it with two output variables, e.g.: `[y1,y2] = prisub(13)` If you call it only like `prisub(13)`, by default MATLAB will only return/display the first output variable.
Thank you so much.
And it was a joke.
Ubuntu?
Are both of your matrices invertible? I tried this with two matrices that *are* invertible and got the zero matrix.
Ubuntu is not a text editor. That would be vim.
These are the 2 matrices i'm given A = \[4 2 1 4; 2 0 1 1; 1 1 2 1; -3 2 1 3\]; B = \[-3 2 2 1; 0 1 1 0; -1 -1 0 1; 2 2 -1 -1\]; All I've got for the code really is inv(A); inv(B); &amp;#x200B; C = inv(A\*B); D = inv(B)\*inv(A); &amp;#x200B; Thanks!
You don't get *exactly* zero? Or the result is large? It's unlikely you would get exactly zero.
 clc;clear; A = [4 2 1 4; 2 0 1 1; 1 1 2 1; -3 2 1 3]; B = [-3 2 2 1; 0 1 1 0; -1 -1 0 1; 2 2 -1 -1]; if (det(A) == 0) || (det(B) == 0) disp('A or B are not invertible') else zm = ((A*B)^-1) - (B^-1) * (A^-1) end This gives me zm = 1e-15 * small numbers, which is essentially 0.
I do get an extremely small output, 1.38777878078145e-16 -4.44089209850063e-16 1.11022302462516e-16 -8.32667268468867e-17 \-6.24500451351651e-17 2.22044604925031e-16 -8.32667268468867e-17 2.77555756156289e-17 1.11022302462516e-16 -6.66133814775094e-16 2.22044604925031e-16 0 \-6.93889390390723e-17 3.33066907387547e-16 -2.22044604925031e-16 5.55111512312578e-17 &amp;#x200B; All I'm told in the question is to show that it is a zero matrix, I suppose I can just say it basically is, right?
Okay great but I never said i was using Vim, I said I was using Linux.
Yeah that's effectively zero. Floating point numbers don't have infinite precision.
Whoosh
Thank you!
Thanks so much, I'm a complete noob when it comes to matlab so I really appreciate it.
Oh yeah I get it now - I mistook your subtlety for ignorance. Touche
To clarify, this is an issue with real arithmetic on computers that's not exclusive to matlab. Real numbers are commonly represented using floating-point numbers. This states what the real-number-value is of any bit-pattern you give it. Matlab number occupy 64 bits per number. This means that the maximal amount of unique real-number-values such a bit pattern could represent is 2^64 (but it's a bit less in practice). Since there are an uncountably infinite amount of real numbers, this representation misses quite a few (uncountably infinitly many, in fact). When you ask matlab to calculate the inverse of a matrix, it has to do an certain amount of calculations to arrive at that result. Each calculation has intermediary results which all have to be represented in this floating-point format. Since the chance of these values being *exactly* representably is soo small, these calculations make tiny errors in every step, which then also accumulate forward. This is why your difference doesn't result in exactly zero, but something very close. For matlab, a value of around 1e^-16 can be considered zero.

Thanks :) I gonna try this out
gradient \~= derivative, cumsum \~= integral; doing those back-to-back reverses each other, you can't skip step 3 in between. &amp;#x200B; Here's another alternative, if you don't mind losing some samples at the end; you clip off everything after the last zero crossing, in each section, before concatenating: time_vec = linspace( 0 , 10 , 1000 ) ; s = sin( time_vec * 2.5 * pi ) ; l = [ 0 , diff( sign( s ) ) ] == -2 ; last_neg_crossing = find( l , 1 , 'last' ) ; s( last_neg_crossing : end ) = [] ;
Is this also part of why less code to get the same result is better? Faster obviously, but also more precise, if you can avoid an unnecessary operation?
Also: you have to normalize each section individually, or the \`acos\` won't spit out 0 : pi as intended. You should probably \`unwrap\` the result, too.
You can keep it as a table, specifying `RowNames` as the unique name you mentioned. You don't have to do it this way, but if you're working with tables, the option is available. When you've built the table, you can use the [`writetable`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/writetable.html) method to write to a CSV file, including the variable and row names as the first row and column, if you'd like. When logging information about the application (info, events, errors, etc.) it's best to write immediately to ensure you don't lose anything in a crash; when writing data in bulk, it's often best to write all at once, as the operation is costly.
It won't plot my imaginary axis values for some reason. Any idea?
If i understand your question, i think this is what you want: [https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-and-simulating-radar-systems-using-matlab-and-simulink-81966.html](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-and-simulating-radar-systems-using-matlab-and-simulink-81966.html)
Thanks for the reply, and advice. All the data I need to write (specifically ADC and ABS data) has already been gathered live, and stored off in two CSV files which I need to use. I will keep trying this approach. Let me ask, if I have written some data to my file, can I open it again, and append some more data, or the original data be overwritten? Thanks again.
It creates a vector of length 400000 going from 0.000001 to 199.9995 in increments of 0.0005
Yes and to clarify, you don't need the brackets. You can just do x = 0.000001:0.0005:200
Awesome thanks. Case closed!
Don't forget Mr. ; either
It creates a vector with elements starting from the value 0.000001 and consecutive incremented by 0.0005 upto the value less than 200(more precisely upto 199.999501 . So the size of vector would be (1,399999). ​
The default behavior for `writetable` is file-at-once, and I don't think you can modify it. You'd have to use `dlmwrite` to append data. However, it looks like they're working on deprecating this venerable function now, and `writematrix` doesn't seem to have the same functionality. That means that to append data using their newer tools, you'd probably have to read the data in the file, append your new line in MATLAB, and then overwrite the file... not sure why they're moving this direction, but there you have it.
Can't argue with that! Cheers.
Not necessarily. Sometimes doing more operations might be better if you can avoid a [badly conditioned step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number), improving the [stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability) of your algorithm.
Unless you want your command window to be spammed with 400000 values =)
Is your data simply characters and numbers? If so, you can probably get away with just making a big character array and dumping that to a file. Suppose you have a cell matrix C which is filled with either numbers or characters: C = {'hello',3,'test';'haha',4,'nope'}; numLocs = cellfun(@isnumeric,C); C(numLocs) = sprintfc('%g',[C{numLocs}]); % convert numbers to characters C(~numLocs) = strcat('"',C(~numLocs),'"'); % create character array C(:,end) = strcat(C(:,end)); C = join(C,',',2); % join along 2nd dimension with comma in between C = strjoin(C,newline); fid = fopen('output.csv','w'); fprintf(fid,C); fclose(fid);
Is the orientation of the image within the larger array the same as the orientation of it on its own?

I actually wrote some code just last week to do basically this same thing. Final result plot looks like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/FvsEYeu.png) Instead of plot3, I used the surface function so that I could assign a color map to my traces - that required me to pretend that each of my vectors was really a 2 x N matrix (so X = [X X], Y = [Y Y], Z = [Z Z]). If you don't care about putting a color map onto your traces then plot3 is probably the move. &amp;nbsp; I suspect the problem you're having is that all of your lines are showing up on top of each other in one 2D graph. When you declare a figure and immediately call "hold on", it sets the figure as a 2D plot. You have to plot a 3D line on your graph before you can call "hold on," so you can either plot your first line before your loop or you can just put "hold on" in each iteration. When I run some of my data through the same loop as you, it turns out like [this](https://imgur.com/4qxMZWj). If I instead put the "hold on" inside of the loop, I get [this](https://imgur.com/7Jf86SS) which I think is more along the lines of what you're looking for. &amp;nbsp; Hope this helps!
plot(timearray, imag(P)) will plot the imaginary part of P even if it’s zero. What do you mean by not plotting? Is it throwing an error or just giving you an empty plot?
xlswrite lets you append data. It doesn't delete a file and make a new one, it just writes to the existing file if it's already there. You can specify the cell where you want to start the export. So you could pretty easily export, say, a 10 X 1000 table at A1 and then a 10 X 1000 table at A10 and get them vertically concatenated. However, I agree with the other user that in the case of data that you aren't going to lose, you're better off writing it all in one operation.
I'm plotting the point with values substituted in for x1, x2, etc and it's only giving me the magnitude plot. The imaginary part remains as zero.
Oh that's quite cool! What sort of experiment were you plotting yours for? &amp;#x200B; I had some luck with tweaking the original plot3 code and got something [this](https://imgur.com/a/zkLOpMo), which isn't too bad! In terms of what you had where it was showing the straight lines because of the 'hold on', I had the same but if you rotate/change view it was 3D. &amp;#x200B; A friend of mine had a go and managed to get the waterfall working which looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/n4vuWq6). Quite similar I guess to the plot3 one I got, but with colour contours. In both cases, its very nice to see the change in peak positions, which is a massive win for me as the data took an eternity to collect. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for your help!

I’m at the tail end of a PhD in the biomedical sciences. These are measurements of the level of Ca^2+ inside of hepatocytes (liver cells) as I stimulate them with doses of hormone. In my case I mostly just wanted to ~~fill up pages in my thesis~~ present the information in a way that the reader could see all of the traces from an experiment together to get an idea of the overall sensitivity. When I stimulate the control group, instead of getting all those spikes we just get a saturated/sustained response, indicating a loss of sensitivity in the experimental group (which is what’s pictured above). I’m glad you found a working solution!
Thanks that really helps!
What’s a courseware?

Can you be a bit more specific about how the image is defined (bunch of zeroes and ones? Double valued intensities?) and what separates the "target" shape from the others? Based on the functions you're allowed to use, I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that you're looking for e.g. a black square in a white field filled with black circles. You can approach this several ways. For example, you can create a "scope" the size of your target shape and slide it over all positions in the image, and determine if all the values in that scope match the value of the target (in my example of the square, you can see if the amount of zeroes in the scope is equal to the amount of zeroes in the square) Another way that comes to mind is using "find" to see where a row/column of zeroes with the length of your square exists in the greater image. You didn't list it in your allowed functions, but you can code your own version with a bunch of for-loops. Hope that helps.
It's extremely unclear what you're asking for. You want to test whether an exact floating point value is already in a list? That's probably not a good idea.
Would you mind putting 4 spaces in front of each line of code? That helps Reddit to know what is code and formats the spacing correctly.
An explanation of the algorithm can be found in Strang's Linear Algebra lectures available from MIT OCW. As to how you want to implement that, honestly that "without using built in functions" restriction stumped me. Why would you use Matlab if that's what you want?
How about creating an array of your deck, randomly change up the order (basically shuffle), and deal cards row by row?
To add on to what /u/Socratesnote said, you can code your own version of 2D cross-correlation if you know EXACTLY what you are looking for. But then, this assignment becomes an exercise to code an existing function instead of an actual assignment for image processing. So I'm not really sure what the learning goal here is.
Sorry about the formatting, I'll keep that in mind. Yes I can use functions in the library. Not really any scope as far as what I can and can't use. Just need to make it work My first thoughts were actually to use randperm( ), but my professor pushed me towards this route. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me!
I'm trying to think of what might make sense for how to approach solving this problem, and I think it might help to take a step back and draw or write out on paper, what happens during a black jack game. Start off really general "dealer deals out cards, the player makes some choices, then the dealer follows some rules, then harness are compared, and the money is paid. " But investigate each step of what's happening. What you'll probably aim for is a flow chart where you have a concrete idea of how to program each step. Ultimately, most code is a series I'd small problems solved 1 line at a time. The reason I think it would make sense to start from there is because my overall impression of the code you've written is that you know what done off the ingredients you want to use are, but you don't really have a recipe you are following... if that analogy makes sense. For example, from the code and your help request, it's unclear whether you are solely concerned with whether the cards in a single round of hands do not repeat, or whether you want to use a deck of a finite size that decreases the available options each time a card is dealt.
Please post a snippet of your code. For example, what you’re running to generate that plot.
do this. it will ensure you don't double-count cards.

Do you mean `size()` ? Or something else?
Yes that function displays the dimensions of any matrix but I want my workspace to show it automatically next to the variable name
I've been using grdread2 function on some .grid files for a similar project. Can you transform the nc files to .grd?
Well I would much rather use the built in functions. But the thing is, I have a computational analysis exam and this is one of the problems we need to do. My professor thinks its too easy to just use the built in functions to do computations, and wants us to do it this way. I understand his reasoning. Fortunately though, I have figured out how to do it.

Should I not create functions in "output" tab, but put them in the "library" tab
No I need to see what bin edge that value belongs too and then what the count of that bin is. But as I’m using HSV they are stored as Doubles which means the bins are grouped.
Hi again, just wanted to show you the result of applying a ramping function to each signal ([result](https://i.imgur.com/x14gdV8.png)). I applied it to 1% of the signal both at the beggining(0 to 1) and at the end (1 to 0). Getting the percentage any lower seems to bring back the spikes. It works, spikes have been removed, although it's still a bit noticeable, however its much better than what I had. Thanks for the help
Nice try, but I doubt anyone wants to do your homework for you?
I'm still not sure what you mean. If you have an array of bin edges, an array of counts, and a new value, `x`, to put in a bin, wouldn't the value just go into the last bin with an edge value less than `x`? You can do that with `find` if you read the documentation.

As far as I know, no.
Yes. One can definitely solve those problems in Matlab. Easily.
&gt;I would like to be able to input a value for longitude and latitude and have Matlab output what the exact temp is at that location. You're looking for interpolation. Check the documentation. You wouldn't get this from the plot, you would interpolate directly from your data. &gt;Also would anyone know how to have Matlab's ncread('') read through an entire folder of files so I dont have to individually input the name of the files? You can use the `dir()` function and a for loop.
You'll have to see whether the value being produced is actually correct.
Thanks, I will have a look at these.
Thanks, I will give this a go!
Yes one can. One being you.

Thank you for the link. Nice to see good support on this subreddit and other matlab forums
Temp(Temp == min(Temp))
This sub isn't designed to answer your homework so look at this for an example. If you have a matrix and you want the first row simply type Mat(1,:) If you have a variable say x=3 And type Mat(x,:) That will give you the third row. Makes sense?
You didn’t read the question properly, and I think this is a perfectly acceptable question for this forum
First one, I miss the &lt;&gt; just in this Reddit post. Second, I learn this from another youtube tutorial that uses Simulink with GY85 IMU. I will add the link later. Finally the third, I will try to learn this method. Thank you very much.
It sounds like you want to do: Result=Temp(A); Where Temp is the temperature matrix, and Result is the answer you're looking for.
This is called indexing. There is a very good section of the documentation that explains it. I'd recommend reading it.
THANKS EVERYONE
Yea fine whatever. I removed my negative comments so that it is still helpful.
Yep. Plot each formula in matlab, print, then mark up to indication which region meets the =, &lt;, &gt; , etc. criteria
How can i plot the objective functions and constraints
You're going to need to use cell arrays. &amp;#x200B; A cell array can contain any data type inside each one of its elements. &amp;#x200B; So for example, here is how I would fill a 1x100 cell array of random 3x3 data.... &amp;#x200B; `my_cell = {};` `for ii = 1:100` `my_cell{ii} = rand(3,3);` `end` &amp;#x200B; Cell arrays are invoked by using curly brackets, {}, instead of regular ones.
Thank you my friend. Got it! Happy Friday!
While a cell array is fine, since all of your "cells" are the same size, it is faster just to use a 3D array. You can initialize it by saying: my_array = zeros(3,3,100); And then you can assign the i'th element of that array by saying my_array(:,:,i) = rand(3);
Since all of his sub-matrices are the same size, he can just use a 3D array.
He could, but that design is further from his intended goal (at least what I assumed it to be). &amp;#x200B; Using a cell array in this way is similar in behavior to chained accessors that other programming languages allow you to do. AKA you can do "my\_cell{1}(1,3)". So yea, pick you flavor I guess, I get what you're saying though.
Yeah, it's never too early to learn about cell arrays, and for 3x3x100 speed won't come into play- but a 3D array is about 100x's faster to build and access than a cell array of the same data.
I recommend [contacting MathWorks Support](https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html) for this.

Thank you. After reboot I had to activate it again, so I guess I’ll have to contact them.
Use a cell array of it absolutely has to be 100 3x3 arrays. It’s easier and faster to work with a 3x3x100 array, though
Will do - was leaving for class when I posted so I just thought I'd post this in the case that someone knew how to fix it and I could just come back and do it in the meantime. Thanks.
[dlmread](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dlmread.html) will read delimited text fields from a file for you. 2019a introduces a replacement function, readmatrix, which I haven’t yet used myself, but would be preferred to dlmread if you have the new version.
What is your exact error? There has been an issue in the past with MATLAB on Linux losing the activation information due to the MAC address of your computer changing from when it was first activated. The license is associated with the MAC of the interface you used to activate it (in my experience). This actually was a problem on my machine because the network manager would randomize the MAC (for security), which would then confuse the MATLAB license.
 I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
There's a function to give you the scale of that floating point error about any particular value, called `eps()`. Because of the way floating point numbers work, that error is different for small values than it is for large values. Near unity, that error is about 10^-15 on a modern pc. Near the largest value that can be represented by double length floating point (the default datatype in Matlab), about 10^308 , the error is about 2 x 10^292
What type of plot is it? Also, your image may be alright. I've had some Matlab EPS exports embed an extremely low-resolution raster preview that some viewers would display. However, opening the file in a text editor showed that all the correct info was there, and including the EPS in a latex file had the full vector image. Also, are you using MATLAB's print command, or using the File -&gt; Save as from the image window? I've had issues with the File -&gt; Save as menu in the past.
The best way to avoid floating point error from becoming a problem is to avoid extremely large or extremely small values, and particularly avoid combining them in certain ways. For example, obtaining a small number by multiplying an extremely large number by an even more extremely small number will result in a lot of error. Another classic example is subtracting two large but nearly equal numbers to give a small number.
MATLAB actually has its own configuration for shortcuts in the editor preferences. I believe it defaults to Emacs style on Linux, but you can change it to either vim or Windows if desired.

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
Linprog for linear problems. There are a variety of solvers for nonlinear problems. See https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/solver-based-nonlinear-optimization.html
Based on the posts you made so far, I suggest brushing up on your calculus first.
It's become a huge problem because recent versions of networkmanager are randomising MAC addresses. I had a conversation with Mathworks support about this well over a year a go, and pointed out that it was going to become an increasing problem with a lot of distros, but they havent done anything about it since. Relying on MAC addresses was always dumb, in any case even without mac randomisation: for example I lose activation every time I switch on my VPN for the same reason
Now hold on. Let's take a step back and just confirm something. Can you, or can you not, solve these by hand?
i just ran into this! I believe my fix was to run the line: set(0, 'defaultFigureRenderer', 'painters'); in command line.this uses a vector style renderer, not a bitmap. then you should be able to save right to eps/pdf. not sure it always stayed, might want to have it in scripts that print
Since you are dealing with over 100 diffraction patterns, you may want to think about using the surf function for plotting, and specifying a colormap with many transitions such as colormap(parula(128)). (The number is the number of color "steps") If you have a lot of patterns, changes in a continuous surface are often easier to see. Nice looking diffraction data by the way.
I get this one: License checkout failed. License Manager Error -9 This error may occur when: -The hostid of this computer does not match the hostid in the license file. -A Designated Computer installation is in use by another user. If no other user is currently running this program, you may need to activate. Troubleshoot this issue by visiting: https://www.mathworks.com/support/lme/R2019a/9 But neither my MAC changes, nor another user is logged in. I'm pretty sure about both. I'll contact the support as mentioned above. (:
Two suggestions: One is to use export_fig from the file exchange, it’s much better than the matlab print or save functions The other, if you want really good quality graphics, is to use matlab2tikz and then build your image in LaTeX :)
I don't use symbolic variables much. But maybe because you define syms x, MATLAB is basically overwriting the original input X, and saying "X is now Symbolic" but needs defining still? Not at my work pc so can't verify.
That seems like it may be the MAC related issue, since the host ID they use is the MAC address. The way I fixed the error on my machine was to follow the steps in Comment #7 here: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1387350#c7](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1387350#c7). This will disable the randomization of the MAC address (which was what was stopping my machine from working), and requires a restart of your network manager.
tried without same result
Can you clarify exactly what type x takes? Are you passing in the numeric data for the user function (e.g. \[1, 4, 9, 16, 27, etc.\]), or are you passing in a function handle to the user function (e.g. @(x) x.\^2 ). Calling "syms x" will overwrite the variable x that was passed in by the user, so it is no longer going to contain their function. Also, trapz requires numeric data from the function to be passed in, not the function itself.
&gt;are you passing in a function handle to the user function (e.g. @(x) x.^2 ). that thing If it requires numeric data from the function, what do you recommend I do?
You just need to evaluate the function the user provides at the points you want, so something along the lines of "x(T)", where T is the vector of sample times you are using in trapz (remember to write the function so that it can handle the vector data though).
I suggest being more careful when reading the documentation. Y is not a function. Y is a vector evaluated from Y = sin(X), where X is a vector.
+ this has fixed one problem however i still have the undefined variable thing i think its coming from the function
Thank you, will try that later! Since my activation works as long as I‘m connected to the same network I think you’re right.
I con’t
To check if it is in your code calling trapz or the function you are giving it, just give pass a known function as an input (such as by doing this: `agB825806fn2( @(x) sin(x), 1)` ) . How are you trying to call it?
Does trapz even work for symbolic inputs? I doubt it. Why would you apply an integration method for sampled variables to a symbolic function? Why are you using symbolic variables at all? If you want a numerical result, use numbers, not symbols.

It works, thanks!
Should I declared the variable in the "output" tab?
Worked. Thank you! (:

thank you!
Thanks interp2 worked perfectly. Also love the username XD
So you just want to concatenate three images (duplicate or not, whatever) horizontally? Images are represented in matlab by matrices (cause matlab yo), so you just concatenate three matrices: A = ... B = ... C = ... D = \[A B D\] % this will only work if A,B,C all have same number of rows of course Now, because you want to duplicate your images, you can just use \`repmat\` (see \`help repmat\`). Also see \[here\]([https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/images\_images.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/images_images.html)) for information on importing and exporting images. &amp;#x200B; PS: if you have no experience with matlab, there are probably better ways (i.e. programs someone else wrote) to achieve this, especially if you want to transform many images.
I got rid of the "clear" and "exists" and just changed everything to 1's and 0's for convenience sake. &amp;#x200B; if (toc&gt;.1\*maxTime) &amp;&amp; (toc&lt;.2\*maxTime) block1=0; block2=0; block3=0; disp('first time') end if ((block1==0) &amp;&amp; (toc&gt;.5\*maxTime)) timeremaining=maxTime-toc; block1=1 %prevents repeated message fprintf('Warning: half the prescribed time has expired. %1.0f seconds remaining.\\n', timeremaining); end if ((block2==0) &amp;&amp; (toc&gt;(maxTime-10))) block2=1 %prevent repeated warning message disp('10 seconds remain in the experiment.') end if ((block3==0) &amp;&amp; (toc&gt;maxTime)) block3=1; %prevent repeated warning message disp('The experiment has reached its time limit.') src.stop() %end the function end
Not sure if this is your problem - haven't read the code in detail - but the value of toc will change every time it's called (since more time will have elapsed since your tic call). If you want to perform multiple tests on the time elapsed, I think you should be looking to assign the value of toc to a variable first, otherwise you might encounter a race condition - especially at high frequency. Also, do you pre-set values for block1, block2, block3 - if not, looks like they could potentially be undefined when the elseif tests run?
1. Thank you! 2. The reason I tried out the matlab reddit is I haven't been able to find a pre-made program yet and my school let's us download Matlab for free on laptops 3. It's marked nsfw because the word "porn" is in it but maybe that's me being too careful
The domain. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/besselj.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/besselj.html)
how do you find the domain? I just learned the bessel function so i'm a complete beginner
You're obsessing over that function and missing the point. Think back on the mathematical definition of domain and how it is implemented in Matlab.
Well, it's just a matter of porting the code to Matlab. It's easier than you think.
Brain dead user probably
Perhaps I’ve misunderstood the scenario but isn’t the plot in figure 2 A just using a log scale for the horizontal axis. This can be done with the semilog command.
Yep, I’m using a semilog plot in my code. From what I’ve seen for most ODEs in MATLAB is time vs concentration when dealing with Kinetics. However in this research paper the proliferation response on the y axis is plotted against concentration and I’m not sure how to adjust my code to fit that.
Now bear with me I don't know much (anything) about bioengineering, but it looks like in figure 1 they are plotting something called hGH variant, which has units of nanomoles, not time. Meaning figure one is not a solution of an ODE plotted against time. Is hGH a variable or a parameter? They might be plotting a steady-state value for the proliferation as a parameter hGH is being varied, in which case to reproduce you'd need to execute a for loop in matlab and use ode45 to solve for the steady-state for each value of a parameter, stepping the parameter value up for the next iteration
Ahh that totally makes sense now. I’ll try that. Thanks!
I had another look and in the caption of the figure they are plotting the steady-state of a variable against a parameter. In that case a better way would be to just solve for the steady-state by hand if possible, this is done by setting the derivatives to zero and then solving for the steady-state value as a function of the parameter. It might not be possible to get an analytic expression if you have a nonlinear equation, but you can at least get an implicit equation that you can use matlab to solve.
And that would mean the proliferation signal is the parameter?
In this context it would mean it is a variable for which you have a differential equation for, or at least it's made up of some combination of variables. A simple example of this is the equation for logistic population growth dx/dt = x(r-x) where r is a parameter. The steady-state of this equation is when dx/dt = 0, so solving for (non-zero) x at the steady-state you get x=r, which relates the steady-state variable x to the parameter r
Solving the ODE and plotting the results are completely different tasks.
One thing: when you’re indexing through a variable, e.g. trying to get the first column from the variable ‘data’, you would call ‘data(:,1)’. It looks like you have performed step 1 and 2 correctly. As for the normalized variable, how do they want you to normalize it? Do they want it to span [-1,1], do they want you to use the ‘norm’ function, etc? For plotting a variable as a function of another variable, matlab’s website should have some good examples of how to use the plot function
I tried put the things in update pane to output pane No more error but the number is just 0
I'm struggling to get the colormap working, I've tried to define a new variable e.g. "c = colormap(parula(149))" but I keep getting "Warning: Error creating or updating Surface. Error in value of property CData. Array is wrong shape or size" when using the surf(X,Y,Z,C) function. &amp;#x200B; My x,y,z variables are 149x1396 doubles, but my c is 149x3. How would I adjust this so I can get the colormap working? Apologies if this is obvious, my Matlab knowledge is very basic. Thanks
To index into the 1st/2nd columns, try the following: `x = data(:,1);’ `y = data(:,2);’ From the Wikipedia [article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_displacement) on square mean displacement, it appears that you want the average squared distance of all particles (i.e. micro-spheres) at a given time. The MSD seems like a way of measuring how much your particles have drifted in Brownian motion. Note, I’m unsure how you should normalize this quantity. Is your data for only a single particle? If so, then `MSD = (y-y(1)).^2;' and `LagTime = x;’. However, I would double check your task and your data. If someone is asking you for the MSD, it seems like you should have multiple particles. This is because in the single particle case, there is no “mean” in the “mean squared displacement”.

I had to do this 10 years ago and ended up having to pass the data from MATLAB to R. I’d hope to see something in MATLAB by now. But if not, there is a COM interface you can use on Windows to call into R from MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5051-matlab-r-link) if you happen to be on Windows.
Sadly working on Linux, but thank you! It seems there are some tool boxes, but it looks like the annoying task of passing data to R might still be the most efficient method after some digging. Either way, thanks for the feedback! I’ll post a solution when I get one.
Good luck. I’m keen to know what you figure out. Its weird this is still be an issue after so long, but I guess it may not come up too often. I had to write files to /tmp on Linux and then call a new R session from MATLAB back then. It was very ugly. What is it you’re kriging?
Creating a symbolic variable is fairly easy, you just need to do `syms x` to create a new variable called x. You can then combine this variable with the constants and other symbolic variables to form your equation. As for doing the series in symbolic form, the toolbox has some calculus functions you can use to try to solve it ([https://uk.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/calculus.html](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/calculus.html)), but these usually require a finite end for the series.
When you read the actual formula, you say the word "if", so it makes sense that you'd try to use an if function in your code... but that's not necessarily the best approach here. Instead, I'd use Matlab's index capabilities; I'll provide an example below. But first, I want to point out that you also have a few errors transcribing the formula, and those errors may be the source of your problems. See if you can see where my code below is different from yours. value = (1 - (abs(r).^2/h^2) ).^2; % formula for 'value' value( abs(r)&gt;h ) = 0; % for all indices with abs(r)&gt;h, set 'value' to 0
What do you understand so far, and where do you have issues? What have you tried?
Forming the network is clear. The problem is with the routing algorithm implementation. What level MATLAB do I need to learn to understand it.
Here’s a more “vectorized” version of the code. This means no `for` loops are required if `r` is a collection of vectors, e.g. a `[3 x N]` matrix (note, if this is the case, you should specify the dimension in `sum(.)`): `value = 1-sum(r.^2)/h^2;` `value = max( value , 0 );` `value = value.^2;` Or as 1 line: `value = max(1-sum(r.^2)/h^2,0) .^ 2;` Note, I am assuming `r` is real and that your equation’s notation means: `||r||^2 = rX^2 + rY^2 + rZ^2` or a 2D or ND version of that. Regardless, in any number of dimensions, this looks like: `||r||^2 = sum( r.^2 );`
Depends, what kind of engineering branch do you like or study in?
Can you check if I used the proper syntax for this? &amp;#x200B; u(x,t) = Co-symsum(2\*(Co)/((n+.5)\*pi)\*sin((n+.5)\*pi\*x/(R2-R1))\*exp(((n+.5)\*pi/(R2-R1))\^2\*t),n,0,100); My plot doesn't look like what I expect.
I’m studying biomedical engineering so something in this area would be great :D it’s not necessary though, it can be any basic algorithm
You could build a calculator program with a GUI, or only use console input. For biomedical engineering, maybe the game of life would be applicable (google it if you're not familiar) - you could combine it with visualization. Or maybe something involving genetic algorithms. Fractals are often found in nature - you could do something with fractals. Or model or bacteria or a virus spreads. Good luck and have fun.
Thank you very much for the suggestions!!
In my freshman engineering programming class we had a similar task. People did codes for playing tic-tac-toe, playing battleship, etc. against the computer
Kriging is the same as Gaussian process. The machine learning toolbox in MATLAB has GPs, as does DACE (a bit old and limited) and there is the more extensive GP4ML toolbox developed by Carl Rasmussen. If you have the time, try coding up a GP yourself. It's not many lines of code and really helps with understanding what goes on inside.
Thanks for the heads up! I definitely didn’t know that so I’m sure that’ll help me to learn the process! Thanks!
Have you tried the scatter() function?
Thanks for the help. But I forgot to mention that instead of vectors, I work with 2D images. So, the value of **r** is 512x512 matrix, **h^2** has the role of a parameter which has a variable value at each iteration (between 85 and 110). And afterwards, **value** has to have a size of 512x512, which will be a part of another equation, so the dimensions and size must agree.
Do you mean a contour plot? Alternatively a surface plot can be used to plot 3D data.
minmax is a reserved function in matlab, rename your function
Sort of! Except I don't have the x and y for it. My trouble is generating the coordinates for the distribution. Right now my output is an n by 1 matrix instead of the n by 2 matrix I would need for the scatter function. I think my current output is the distance between the current point and the previous point.
Not exactly a contour plot but close I think... Posted the data below. I want to drop a marker for each of these points. The x axis should contain the year ( 1st row of data) and y axis should contain the arrival year (1st col of data). and the 3rd right axis should have the delta V (the table data) tab = 0 2017 2017.5 2018 2018.5 2019 2019.5 2024 40.466 39.623 40.441 39.594 40.492 39.664 2024.5 40.479 39.653 40.432 39.601 40.429 39.608 2025 40.5 39.688 40.438 39.622 40.402 39.591 2025.5 40.525 39.726 40.454 39.652 40.397 39.598 2026 40.552 39.766 40.477 39.688 40.407 39.62 2026.5 40.582 39.806 40.504 39.726 40.426 39.65
Without knowing what your loop looks like, I can't say exactly what the implementation with h looks like, but for the most part, what I've typed above would work for a single iteration (for a fixed h). As I said originally, the implementation (specifically `vectnorm(r)`) would depend on what your data actually looks like - in this case, you'll have to adapt the code based on your own version of the `r`\-array. But I can't say what that would look like with the information that you've provided. Aside from that, did you notice the differences between your code and the formula that you linked (that I mentioned in my first comment)? I suspect that your problems are stemming somewhat from incorrectly transcribing the formula. The formula has `(1-r.^2/h^2).^2`, whereas your code had `1-(r.^2/h^2).^2` which can be quite different from each other. Additionally, your code checked if `r &lt;= sqrt(h)`, whereas the formula has the condition of `r &lt;= h`. Below is some code that shows that what I gave you the first time can work for matrix input. Here both `r` and `value` are size 512x512, but I've just invented the values of all of the variables for the sake of an example. h = 3; x = linspace(-10,10,512); y = linspace(-10,10,512); [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y); r = sqrt( X.^2 + Y.^2 ); value = ( 1 - r.^2/h^2 ).^2; value( r &gt; h ) = 0; surf(x,y,value); shading interp;
Would scatter3() work?
Thanks. I will check tomorrow after some sleep. And I will explain also what mistakes I’ve made when writing the piece of code of the formula in this post. Thanks again.
but the homework asked us to name the function minmax... I have changed it to other names but somehow it won't work. &amp;#x200B; "Create a function called minmax.m that takes any sized two-dimensional matrix as an input anhd returns the minimum and maximum element values as two separate outputs. For instance, if we were to execute the following lines of code: A = \[1 9 13;4 7 -35;1 2 89\]; \[min, max\] = minmax(A); "
So there must be a different issue. If you saved it correctly in your working directory as minmax.m it should give you single outputs. Otherwise, it will default to the MATLAB minmax function which gives mins and maxes for each row (and it looks like it's doing just that). Did you save your m file in your working directory and is it named the same as your function?
Actually, different consideration, is the output giving you 4 maxes or the command line? Because it looks like you're not terminating your computations with ; In your workspace, does Max actually have 4 values?
Try this: tab = [ 0 2017 2017.5 2018 2018.5 2019 2019.5 2024 40.466 39.623 40.441 39.594 40.492 39.664 2024.5 40.479 39.653 40.432 39.601 40.429 39.608 2025 40.5 39.688 40.438 39.622 40.402 39.591 2025.5 40.525 39.726 40.454 39.652 40.397 39.598 2026 40.552 39.766 40.477 39.688 40.407 39.62 2026.5 40.582 39.806 40.504 39.726 40.426 39.65 ]; figure(); C = tab(2:end,2:end); x = tab(1,2:end); y = tab(2:end,1); surf(x,y,C);
Dont think so, the vectors in scatter3() need to be the same length.
I am not sure what the hGH variant is exactly in this paper but I think it's represented by R, the free hGH receptor. The parameter R also shows up in those 4 differential equations. After setting all the derivatives to 0 and solving for the steady-state value as a function of the parameter how exactly would I implement that in my current code?
you can define the vectors as units vectors using the function ones()
can you clarify? The years vectors are the ones that are short. So I would create a ones array [36,1] where the first 9 values were the years, and the remainder of the values were 1?
If there are multiple data points for the first year you can just assign them a new vector where the dates are copied. So if you have [x1, x2,...xn], [y1, y2,...yn], where x1 and x2 have unique dates and the rest are in the same year you could do [year1, year2, ones(1,length(x)-2)*year3].
After you get the steady-states you'll need to work out what the proliferation signal is, it might be a variable or some combination of variables in the steady-state. Then you'll want to plot the result in matlab by setting R as an increasing array with linspace or something, and then plotting the proliferation signal as a function of R, this should reproduce the first figure
no actually in workplace it has only one max and one min. so i'm thinking it should be right? but somehow in the command window i got four maxes: 4, 9, 13, and 89...
yes i did.
nvm turned out I had my axis flipped on the contour, but it worked! Thanks!
Sometimes, it helps to write things out. * Problem: Create a script to calculate the number of laser pulses required to change the velocity of a small block floating in space * Knowns: -mi -dv (delta velocity) -equation to calculate mass loss for each laser strike -velocity change with each strike * Unknown(s): -Laser pulses to change velocity by some value. * Procedure: -Write loop to update mass after a laser pulse and calculate new velocity. -Update variables on each laser pulse. -Terminate after a specified number of pulses or when the velocity change exceeds the desired level.
I'm not familiar with freemat, per-se, but based on reading the code, it looks like in line 4, you set the value of n to be the string "insira a quantidade de valores da forca F: ", and then try to loop over it. Maybe you need to change line 4 to an "input" statement?
Thanks so much for the reply, im pretty terrible at programming so this is probably a stupid question but how do i change it to an input statement?
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/input.html
How is this problem parameterized? If you have equations describing the evolution in terms of some parameters, then the ODE solver should be able to work with that.
Make sure you include a semicolon at the end of the line to suppress the output. Try output=echo\_gen(\[-.5;0;.5;0\],1,0,.5); and you should be fine
You do an 'input' in line 6, after the beginning of the for loop. You just need to add the word 'input' before the parentheses in line 4, to make it work like line 6 does.
The reason conv is fast is more fundamental than just the fact that it is implemented as a compiled binary function. It uses the FFT algorithm which carried out discrete convolutions in O(n log(n)) as opposed to O(n^2) which is the algorithm you are using. For large inputs your code can never match this without also using an FFT based approach.
Well damn, idk how my professor expects us to find a work around. Thank you for your help.
You could try doing ECG waveform analysis; i.e. have your program analyze them and find the QRS complex or something similar (to give it that BME spice)
Use the same pattern you used a few lines latter (the line with '... Input(...)'
That’s because you are looping through the elements of A2. You start with the value 1 for max, then when in the loop it finds a higher value it changes max. It is not suppressed in the command window since you left out the ; therefore you will get four outputs (due to the loop) which are 4 9 13 89. So if your min and max are just one value in your workspace that should be fine.
Hi, it can be parametrised by an ODE. However if the mesh is solved pointwise then the collection of points will get stretched out to the point of being useless, so I think it would need remeshing every now and then.
I usually work with several separate windows and the entire path does not fit. For some reason the first part of the path is shown, not the last that would include the name. Can this be fixed?:)
After deleting &gt;if (xD\[0\]==1) {} in output pane, I manage to get a non zero number, but it is so small (7700589047e-154) still, it doesn't not fit my expectation
Not everything has to happen in code. That kind of thing is much more easily done with pen and paper. You seem to have an idea that if you write the correct code, the figures in the paper will pop right out. That's not how it works. You need to understand what they're showing and how they arrived at that result, and it's not necessarily as simple as solving the DE. Focus less on trying to write the code and more on understanding the problem.
Typically, it’s sufficient to just display negative numbers for beams in compression and positive numbers for beams in tension.
The details aren't really too important here, and I don't have time to read that much code. Basically, you need to have some way of communicating with the device you want to control. Often, hardware like that will allow you to connect via serial port or ethernet and send commands. Other hardware requires more specialized communication tools. It's not really a Matlab specific issue. You'll have to figure out what options are available to communicate with your hardware. Maybe call the vendor.
If you want output formatted as a table, you can put it into a Matlab `table` object and then display it using the built in table formatting. You also definitely *can* use fprintf, but you have to format it yourself, using the available string formatting options offered by fprintf.
First Matlab is not a simulation software. It is a programming language fitted with many specialized scientific library. It includes some nice simulation capabilities, namely simulink. What make this really nice is the capability to generate code from the model, nice solvers. The integration with Matlab is really fluent and that means you can do some computation with Matlab export some parameter to the simulation and import the simulation results back to Matlab. It s quite general (versatile) but for some specific task specilazed software are more appropriate, for instance you can do cfd with Matlab but many other software can do better but can often be only used for that.
Well matlab is not really a "simulation software", Matlab is a full fledged programming language. As for what makes it different there are I think 3 main points: - All the main library are developed and maintained by Matworks which make them easily intercompatible. The syntax is the same for all of them and all the same objects can be used. - It has an easy to use editor and interpreter that is standard for all users. So Matlab on one computer will work and look (nearly) the same as on any other computer. Assuming you have paid for the libraries you want you don't have to worry about versions, packaging, installation... Moreover the IDE is really good for scientific/engineering use. - Simulink is great for system modeling and no real equivalent tool exists.
Well concerning simulink, there are different alternatives. For instance Amesim, modelica, or even the scicos (well far from simulink)... The two first are really devoted to simulation are quite limited to this. I'm not sure if scicos/xcos is still developed but the user experience was not that good.

Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Have you tried plotting the figure first using surf(X,Y,Z), and then writing "colormap(parula(149))" on the next line? Might be easier to figure out what is going wrong.
Cast the data to `datetime` objects and then just plot as usual. Matlab will recognize the data types as dates and conver the appropriate axes as necessary.
You didn't by chance use `n1 = 0;`, did you? I assume not, since it needs to be positive and you say it is, but it doesn't hurt to check; we all make silly mistakes from time to time!
Both numbers are set greater than zero.
Cool, so my assumption was correct. Thanks for humoring me anyway. :) Syntactically, I can't see any problem with what you've typed in the OP. Set a breakpoint on that line, run the code, and mouse over n1 and n2 to see what MATLAB thinks they are at runtime.
Try just... T=readtable(filename) and do the formatting after import.
I’ve started off trying to use the example given for .txt imports on Matlab’s site. So I’m more annoyed it’s their code and it won’t work lol Your example works to set the table variable at least, thanks for that.
Yes, but the problem wants me to state whether it's in compression or tension unfortunately :/
&gt;Matlab table object and then display it using the built in table formatting. if I was to try and do this method how would I go around with having spit out statements? &gt;You also definitely can use fprintf, but you have to format it yourself, using the available string formatting options offered by fprintf. Omg, I totally forgot that I can do it like that. Thank you for reminding me. I think this i sth emethod my prof would like us to use. However, is there a way to underline some parts of the text so I can distinguish which value is for what ie a title?
Plain text doesn't have style features like that. You could output html or something like that I suppose.
Did you make sure that the example is made for the same version of MatLab as the one you're using? It changes. If you type `doc detectImportOptions` at the command prompt, you should get the right version.
What I’m reading in the doc command you have listed is the same as what I’m seeing on the Matlab website so I assume it’s correct for this version.
 x = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]; even_x = x(mod(x,2) == 0); odd_x = x(mod(x,2) ~= 0);
`mod(x, 2)==0` will be `true` for even values and `false` for odd ones. You can then use those logical values as indices.
By far the easiest method^ logical indexing can be slightly tricky, but nothing super challenging with a few google searches. Best of luck OP!
Works perfectly, thank you!
A Newton polynomial is just a summation, so you should be able to define the for loop by the term of the summation f = 0 for ii = 1:n f = f + [summation term] end What this does is it simply adds the new term to the current value. Don't try to code the entire polynomial within the for loop.
I dont quite understand what youre saying. Is my summation term not the "b(col)\*x\^(col-1)"? And if what youre telling me to do is to remove the "@x" then matlab gives me an error telling me to define x, which I can't, since x is a variable to be defined on the graph. And if Im not to code the entire polynomial within the for loop, when exactly would I? Sorry for all these questions, it just feels like this part is far beyond anything we've learned so far.
What I wrote is how you get the value of the function at a specific value of X, which is defined by your plot limits. You would have to define X for that to work. X can be defined as a vector and you can solve your function at once. I made an example code and just tested it, and this is what it gives me b = [1 2 3 4 5] x = [1 2 3 4 5] f=0 for ii=1:length(b) f = f+b(ii)*x.^(ii-1) end f = 15 129 547 1593 3711 Where f is the value of y at each input of x. This can be plotted as f(x,y).
Do you know what the domain of a function is, in general?
It seems I explained poorly what I need to do. So I've been given sets of data x and y, and using those, with Newton Interpolation, I came up with the b matrix, which holds all the coefficients needed to make the line. Now using that b matrix, I must make a function that will plot every x value on a graph, not just the set of x's I was given. The type of function I need is like one youd put into a graphing calculator, where it would plot every x, not just the ones I've been given. Sorry if this isn't making sense, I dont know much of the technical terms for things and Ive never been good at explaining things.
Thank you so much. Turns out I just needed to use syms x and now everything is working.
Yes it is the range of inputs of a function. Do i just input the same domain as the main equation into the besselj function then? i.e. x=linspace(0,1,100), besselj(0, x) Because I did this and my output is linear as in the flow in the tube looks like a triangle.
 Thanks [tardigraderider](https://www.reddit.com/user/tardigraderider)! I am taking an online course, and this was one of the assignments. I actually was doing part of the problem incorrectly, and i needed to add some more logic in my code to get it working.
Copy and paste the following code into your command line: z = linspace(0,20); J0 = but(0,z); figure; plot (z,J0); Now, tell me what the plot looks like. Is it what you expected? If not, tell me what you were expecting. &gt;as in the flow in the tube looks like a triangle. This sentence doesn't make sense in the context of anything else you've asked, so I'm thinking you're falling into the [xy-problem](http://xyproblem.info)
I see, thank you so much for your help, time and knowledge!
Ok thanks for your reply ! &amp;#x200B; The thing is, my hardware is man-made (by me). So I can't call the vendor to question him about how to communicate with it. If you were talking about the sensor, I'm already communicating with it since I'm acquiring data. The question is : Can I control CNC machine with Matlab (on a general basis, not my particular cnc), does a module exist or something ? Best regards.
You should split the equation into two and see what results each side of minus sign give you. ytal_1 = 3.^(3*xtal+1); ytal_2 = 7*(5.^(2*xtal));
Use the .^ operator. Make sure you use it for both exponents. It worked fine for me
 xtal = linspace(1,10,50); ytal = 3.^(3*xtal+1) - (7)*(5.^(2*xtal)); plot(xtal,ytal); This works for me without errors
I get &amp;#x200B; `Error: File: plot.m Line: 2 Column: 12` `Invalid expression. Check for missing multiplication operator, missing or unbalanced delimiters, or other syntax error. To` `construct matrices, use brackets instead of parentheses.`
What version of Matlab are you using? Did you `clear` your workspace before running the script?
I still get the following `Error: File: plot.m Line: 2 Column: 12` `Invalid expression. Check for missing multiplication operator, missing or unbalanced delimiters, or other syntax error. To` `construct matrices, use brackets instead of parentheses.`
Depending on your version of matlab, ypu could use grouping in your plot - check the documentation, probably overkill for what you need. For your 0-1 case, it is easier just to split your data into two series. Create two empty matrices, loop through your data points, and assign each data point to one one of your two new matrices based on whether it is a 0 or a 1. Plot as you would normally, but don’t forget to use “hold on” to add the second series to the axes, and “hold off” when you’re done.
Thanks for the reply. I will edit the body above because I probably didnt specific enough. The x-values fall on a spectrum from 0 to 1 so it needs to be fluid - like a colour bar but under the plot lines.
Try setting your domain to -0.5 to 0.5 instead.
ah... that changes it a bit... look up the documentation for the “scatter” function... this allows you to specify extra series to use for coloring the markers based on value... you have to play a bit with this function and try various options
happy cake day
Look into polyval: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyval.html
I know what the bessel function should look like and when I copy/pasted your code it looked as it should. Sorry for not being clearer in my OP. The gist of my problem: There is a pipe with a fluid experiencing oscillating flow. I have an equation to output the velocity of the fluid at an input time and radius. A component of the equation is the bessel function. The radius is assumed to be 1. So I have radius set as linspace(0,1). I also use this as the Z input in the besselj function. The time is set at a specific point. When I run the calculations and plot the velocity vs radius the profile is linear. However, I consulted my professor and the profile should be curvy. I want to know if I am using the besselj function correctly. Another note is that the equation involves dividing imaginary numbers but the final velocity output is only the real component.
There's nothing magic about a cnc machine. Like any other piece of hardware, to control it you must be able to send commands to it through some interface. If you can, then you can control it. If you can't, then no module, toolkit, or anything else will be able to do so either. Something might exist on the Mathworks file exchange, but if you fundamentally can't connect to your hardware then nothing will be able to help.
I'd say it's possible, though it will take a good chunk of your time each day. You could probably do one method per day for the first two days, do some testing on the third day, and conclude with writing the report on the fourth. I can't really give you any methods for what to do, but image processing could be something to look into. Matlab lends itself pretty well to image processing through the use of matrices for pixels. Hope it goes well for you.
Did you get what am I expected to do? What are those methods? Can't I find their code on net? Then just do
This completely changes the problem as we did not know you were looking for a time-dependent solution.
You are expected to learn. It’s pretty obvious that’s not what you plan to do.
Can you elaborate. What application. What did you already try. What was wrong with your previous searches?
You'd have to make it into a string. sprintf will be your friend for that. You can also display it in a matrix, where column 1 is the mean, column 2 is lower bound of CI, and column 3 is upper bound of CI, which is probably the cleaner thing to do.
Specify what you're trying to achieve, break it down to a clear technical question, and then maybe we might be able to help. How you make an image life-like is a pretty huge question, and I'm sure people charge very hefty consultancy fees to answer that particular question.
I was searching for something like Alex net but I couldnt make it run.ı have searched lots of websitesite but couldnt find a good one i am using an old version of Matlab
I would like to but unfortunately I don't have time to learn I know some though was following the class...
Regarding quesiton 1; rephrasing, what you want is a way to estimate your amplitude and angular frequency(w) from your data. It needs to be in the right ballpark, but most sensible estimates will do. For the Amplitude you could use the [root mean square]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square ) of the y values, which should be sqrt(2) times smaller than the amplitude, and you can calculate it simply from the input data ([rssq](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/rssq.html)). For estimating w i got a trick too, but how well that works really depends on the level of error in the data; with a lot of noise it will overestimate w a lot. Realising you have a sine wave, we can approximate the frequency by counting the number of times the line passes 0. I choose this measure because it's easy to calculate (how does this formula work?: (numberOfCrossings = nnz(diff(ydata &gt; 0)~=0) ). A sine crosses 0 twice for each cycle so the number of crossings devided by two gives you the number of cycles, and since you measured for 360 degrees, you can calculate the number of degrees per cycle by dividing: 360 / #cycles = 360 / (#crossings/2) Regarding question two: Maybe there is a way i don't know, but I don't think it'll get much simpler than this. Also!: you're missing phi in your fit function! `fitFunc = @(x,xdata)x(1).*sind(x(2).*xdata);` Is that on purpose or a bug?
Trained for what? It doesn't sound like you have much background in machine learning.
Yes i am new at this topic and i am searching for machine learning deep learning and I want to detect any object using picture or camera. To do this in an easy way i need pretrained network such as Alex net tensorflow .. But how can i get these functions and adjust matlab to use these . Thanks .
What is going wrong? Why are you using symbols for this?

This is the first post I've even seen go over three iterations.
Hello again, my adventurous student friend! Testing for equality with zero is typically not recommended with floating point arithmetic. There's plenty of resources out there explaining why if you're interested, but for now just understand that it's not a very good practice. The best way to deal with this is to completely avoid testing for equality with zero; instead, test for a number *near* zero (for example, a number whose magnitude is less than 0.05, which is half of your step). What about setting `sec` to zero when it's small? Well, in your inner while loop, think step-by-step about what would happen if you were setting `sec` to zero each iteration (pencil and paper may help here). Think about the value of `sec` as you subtract 0.1 from it and compare it with 0.1 to determine if you should set it to zero (i.e. is 0 &lt; 0.1? Is -0.1 &lt; 0.1?). This should explain why the timer "stops" when you use the conditional test you mentioned in the OP. Remember, the condition used for `while` is evaluated on each iteration of the loop. I know you know that because I linked you the documentation for it. :) As for your outer while loop, a free tip: if you're going to break on `count == n`, why not use that to create your while condition instead of using `true` (which is a recipe for disaster via infinite loop)?
Thanks for replying and replying so quickly :) I tried your solutions out and realised the problem wasn’t with x0. It turns out that in a script I run before this one (to establish my ydata) some of the values were being returned as NaN because my code wasn’t robust enough. I went back to change that and now it seems to be working the way I expect it to!
If you do not own the official mathworks neural network, then the best alternative is probably matconvnet toolbox which can be downloaded for free. I Don t use it, but I believe it is possible to import pretrained network from different sources, as the official toolbox does. Nb. Good matconvnet to find its official website
Hopefully, matrix dimensions agree
Luminance in images is not something that's easy to change, simply because color is an incredibly complex topic. For one, the *perceived* brightness of a color depends not on the amount of light coming out of it, but also on our ability to absorb that light due to the photoreceptors in our eye, the dilation of our pupil, etc. A common method of converting RGB to grayscale (which can be thought of as "luminance") is: luminance = 0.2989 * R + 0.5870 * G + 0.1140 * B With that in mind, the question becomes--how do you brighten or dark an image? Matlab's brighten function takes an input argument `gamma`, which ranges from -1 to 1, and applies the following function: gamma = 1 - min(1-tol,beta); % if beta &lt; 0 gamma = 1/(1 + max(-1+tol,beta)); % if beta &gt; 0 new_color = old_color.^gamma; In other words, if you call `brighten(X,0.1)`, then Matlab performs `X.^0.9`. Recall that we have `0 &lt;= X &lt;= 1`, which means that raising to a positive power less than 1 increases the value of the number. If we call `brighten(x,-0.1)`, which darkens the result, then Matlab performs `X.^(1/0.9)`, which reduces the value. So, given an image, we can brighten or darken individual pixels, or the entire image using the `BRIGHTEN` function. We now have a few questions which must be answered: 1. When you brighten an image, how much does it brighten the whole image? 2. How do you compare the brightness of two images? 3. How do you brighten or darken one image in order to match the brightness of another?
For this, I would recommend using `scatter`, which will create dots at each point. You can specify the colors of individual dots. First plot all of the red dots, then plot all of the green dots.
Matlab also has helpful graphing tools to visualize analysis.
I have this signal from my accelerometer, I want to perform FFT so I can get Frequency and amplitude . My question is how do I save this data as a signal?
You're looking for all possible permutations. Start your search there.
What have you tried?
I don't know too much about the home license restrictions, but you can explicitly cast an integer as int64 with: int64(A) After that command, 'A' will be treated as a 64-bit integer. You can also use uint64 if you know the integer is positive. Note that there is still a limit imposed by hardware, and there is no warning when you hit that limit. This limit is intmax('uint64'). (Somewhere around 1.8E19). You note that your integers are around 10\^20, which is over 5 times larger than the maximum integer you can store in an unsigned 64-bit integer. If you actually need that precision, then you're going to have to get creative (although I recommend considering if you actually need that precision). One workaround that may work for some problems, but not others, is to have a second integer which counts every time intmax is exceeded, and resets the first integer appropriately. Be aware that you will have to pay close attention to how these numbers behave in any calculations you perform, and you will have to understand how the computer actually does these calculations, otherwise you may unintentionally lose precision.
I guess A(1,1)=A(2,2) would be an idea a make a loop off that?
Should be the loading screen for next update
The numbers are the outputs of two counting arguments. All I really need is the ratio, though an exact fraction would be nice. I may wind up doing the whole thing in python where there are free add-ons for this sort of thing. \&gt;&gt; One workaround that may work for some problems, but not others, is to have a second integer which counts every time intmax is exceeded, and resets the first integer appropriately. Thank you for that.
If you have the symbolic toolbox, you can work with arbitrarily large numbers to perfect precision.
Afraid I don't have that. I only have a home license.
A home license can have the symbolic toolbox. In your command line type "ver" and see what you have.
That would turn this matrix: a b c d Into this matrix: d b c d Are you sure that's the route to take? Make sure you know how matrix indexing works: https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html

If what you mean is to adjust the luminance of an RGB image, the workflow you are likely to want is: &amp;#x200B; lab = rgb2lab(RGB); Then operate on the luminance channel of the resulting image in L\*a\*b\* colorspace according to whatever effect you are trying to achieve, the gamma correction described by /u/NedDasty below being an example, then move back to RGB: RGB = lab2rgb(lab);
MATLAB Version 9.4 (R2018a)
There are two things that you should know. (1) If you don’t call `hold on;` before plotting, it will overwrite any existing plots in your figure. However, this doesn’t matter much for you, since for your problem you should only need to call `plot` once. (2) To draw a single continuous line, only call `plot` once. So you need to make `erel_vec` where `erel_vec(i) = erel` for each iteration of the loop. Then call `plot( 1:n , erel_vec )`.
Don't worry, I understand english well enough! I'll try your suggestion, thanks!
Odometer probably starts at 1
Usually we recommend using a Scope block or the Simulink Data Inspector. If you really need it in MATLAB, you can use a To Workspace block to get your data back into MATLAB. If you need to plot it while the simulation is running, it gets more complicated but you can do it
There are plenty of functions that handle interpolation: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/interpolation.html
I will be using To Workspace block as defined in my problem. The graphs are at the conclusion on the simulation. From there, do I use typical graphing commands in matlab?
You data should be saved as a structure with fields that you can access. out = sim('example_simulink_model'); some_data = out.some_data; other_data = out.other_data;
Quite a few problems here... 1) Let's look at your function first. You scripted this: **function FF = F(x)** **FF(1) = 7\*x\^3 - 10\*x - y - 1;** **FF(2) = 8\*y\^3 - 11\*y + x - 1;** Is this really how you script a function in the first place? 2) Is this supposed to be numerical or symbolic? Looking at your code, it's not entirely apparent what you're trying to achieve here. 3) **FF(1)** and **FF(2)** . Are you sure that's what you want?

Define matching member of x?
Well, I want the resulting matrix to be 3x3x2. The (:,:,1) matrix will be y*x(1) and the (:,:,2) matrix will be y*x(2).
In order to do this, you're going to have to make `x` a, "3D," matrix using the `permute` command: `x = permute(x, [3, 1, 2]);` And then multiply `x` and `y` as before. I suggest reading through the documentation for `permute`, as the second argument to the function, the order of new dimensions, can be pretty confusing at first.
No. No. Definitely not.
&gt; The question involves finding the velocity of a rotating and revolving disk which requires a vector cross-product. I then have to use that result to divide it by another radius The result of a cross product is a vector, which you then want to divide by a scalar? I guess I don't see where the problem is.
My apologies, I was not clear. Yes, the result of the cross product is a vector, to which I have to divide by the radius of the rotating disk, expressed as another vector (which happens to be 1-dimensional).
&gt; the radius of the rotating disk, expressed as another vector What? The radius of a single disk must be scalar, right? Do you have a family of disks with different radii? Or do you have the radius as a position vector like `[x, y, z]`? If that's the case, you just need the 2-norm.
The entire disk revolves about a centre with radius [0 1.2 0] and an angular velocity of [0 0 -4]. As a result, the centre of the disk has a velocity of [4.8 0 0]. The disk also rolls on a horizontal floor without slipping. The disk has a radius of [0 0 0.2]. I need to then find the angular velocity of the disk's rotation, which I would like to divide [4.8 0 0] by [0 0 0.2], but I know that doesn't make a lot of sense mathematically.
Interesting. Will try. Thank you.
Coughs in racket
Well, if there's some sort of mathematical formalism there, I'm not aware of it. I would suggest you either use the sum of those "vectors" (e.g. `r = sum(r0);`, where `r0` is the vector you have), or extract the non-zero element, either by its fixed position in the vector (e.g. `r = r0(3);`, or by logical indexing (e.g. `r = r0(r0 ~=0);`. Best of luck.
Honestly, I don't get why Matlab is treated like it's worse than JS or any other language. I have used matlab for about 3 years and find it quite intuitive and easy to write. Whereas with HTML/JS/whatever, I find that it's just not as fluently writable than Matlab. Granted, I only have a basic understanding of other languages, but for example starting commands with &lt;&gt; and end them wth &lt;/&gt; each time is just so annoying and unnecessary to me. Or loops in HTML, I need to explicitly write the loop variable, tell it to loop x times AND tell it to increase by one? That is just so much easier in Matlab. Am I missing sthg? Or am I just so used to Matlab that it's hard for me to switch to another language?
When something doesn't make sense mathematically, that should tell you that you're doing something wrong. Things that don't make sense mathematically *just don't make any sense*. If you find yourself needing to calculate the square root of elephant, you have made a mistake. You should figure out where you went wrong rather that struggling to find a way to get an answer for the square root of elephant.
scratch is the best
Funny you say that because HTML is *also* not a real programming language. It's a formatting language
Markup language is even in the name lol.
The radius of a disk is a scalar. If you have represented it as something other than a scalar, you're wrong.
This post is 100% ironic, I dont have anything against Matlab or people who use it. If I offend anyone I will take it down gladly.
haha oh yeah!
You know in the UK irony is a very specific thing. I find it strange when people use it to mean sarcasm or the likes. For example getting run over by an ambulance is ironic because you got injured by the very thing that is supposed to come treat injuries.
historical. a) array starting at 1 vs 0 b) until R2016, a script could not have subfunctions, and "the Matlab way" was to put each function as its own separate file. Ugh. c) the old (OLD) versions used to be slow, (or at least were considered slow since they were interpreted) but that really is no longer the case. Finally d) most people's first exposure to matlab programs are code / programs that have been passed down in labs, and are a hodge-podge of poorly maintained piles of code that run a specialized situation, and are given zero documentation. It sours you fast.

I think export\_fig uses fig2svg: [https://github.com/kupiqu/fig2svg/](https://github.com/kupiqu/fig2svg/) &amp;#x200B; you can give it a try in fig2svg directly. If fig2svg fails, submit an issue to fig2svg, otherwise you can do it to export\_fig
What kind of error are you getting, if any?
Not really an error, what my code is plotting just isn’t right. I should have included a link of the correct dynamic plot. If you Wikipedia the Jansen mechanism it has a gif of how it’s supposed to look and move.
Look up the algebraic approach of one of those methods. Then simply convert the algebra into a matlab code. Shouldn't be complicated. Good luck!
What does your code plot? Can you post a picture?
I am not with my computer right now. It’s basically a jumbled up mess that rotates around the first ground point. I will post an update when I get back to my laptop though.
Okay
Seems......unnecessarily complicated to me. What exactly is inputArg2 supposed to do anyway?
inputArg2 is supposed to be the column number
Now see here. You said "matching member", that implies that the operation is taken over a proper subset, but the description you're giving me is telling me for all? Which is it? And while you're at it, you should also address the following questions: 1. " ...create a 3-D matrix..." - What exactly is this 3-D matrix? This is actually my first time encountering this term. 2. "...in which each 2-D matrix..." - So both x and y are matrices? What do you want to do with the fourth dimension?
Why not just do sum(inputarg1(:,inputarg2))/length(inputarg1(:,inputarg2)); ? I'm not at my PC to check, but I'm pretty sure that'd give you a column average. As it is your function asks for inputarg2 and then overwrites it by being a changing dummy variable in a for loop, so inputarg2 gets erased, effectively. For your inputs, why not just say M and n? You want take the average of the nth row of an mxn matrix right?
This is the end of what is plotted. The black line goes in and out and a blue triangle forms on it. The triangles are supposed to be blue, but other than the grounds, nothing is in its place.
I tried your suggestion, but I'm getting an error message that there aren't enough input arguments.
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y5TWpMlVyQVuL\_mQQEtmcjTkpIxcoYt5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y5TWpMlVyQVuL_mQQEtmcjTkpIxcoYt5) here's a better view. As you can see, the static plot is correct, but the dynamic plotting is way off.
I'm not asking you what it is, I'm asking you **what is it supposed to do**? Look back at your code and tell me, what does it do every time it appears in your code. If you cannot answer this, then you should rethink your actions up until now.
Can't you offset x and y?
www.letmegooglethatforyou.com
First. Rename your arguments. Inputarg1 and inputarg2 are just asking to get confused in later assignments. Secondly, you can just sad your own arguments. Example, ode(n, tfinal, dx, nu, eta) You can add as many arguments as you want. There'll be warnings if the inputs aren't used in the function, but that's just a warning
Thanks for your help!
Thanks in advance guys
Look in your variable initiation. Y will always be equal to WinningNumber. You could right it like this (im on mobile sorry for format): &gt; playerNb = input('Select a number between 1 and 1000'); WinningNb = randi(1,1000); While playerNb ~= WinningNb Etc.. ...
Ik redoing my comment. Sorry im on mobile... Your disp things are fine. This seems like an honeworkd so I'd rather let yo mu think than solving it for you:)! When you assign x to an input, you created a variable for the player's number with out creating a variable 'PlayerNumber'. When you assign WinningNumber to randn(1,1000), you then reassign it to 'y'. You do not need to do this. Change your x for PlayerNb and remove your 'y' and change them for WinningNb. From there, start to rethink the problem :)
Thank you, I did this and it helped, especially reading it out just made more sense
No was there couple of weeks ago haha
`m = [ 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];` `n = 2;` `average = sum(m(:,n))/length(m(:,n))` This returns a value of 5. because (2+5+8)/3=5. as a barebones function, you could use this: &amp;#x200B; `function [a] = caverage(M,n)` `a = sum(M(:,n))/length(M(:,n));` `end` But you'd want to add all the usual input screens to throw error messages and such if the user puts in something that wont let the function work. But if you save the above in your matlab folder then type `m = [ 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];` `n = 2;` `a = caverage(m,n)` you will get a = 5. This should work for any MxN matrix as long as n&lt;=N.
this is a good way to ask someway to recheck their own scripts. When i was first learning matlab, i had a rough time figuring out how to communicate this idea with other classmates who didn't seem to pick up on how to solve problems with matlab.
omg. I jsut realized i don't know how to play that game and have been interpreting this meme backwards since i first saw it.
This is kind of what I want, but I haven't found a way to do it yet.

Instead of having x and y start at 0 have them start at 0.5, they can still count in intervals of 1 like before: x=0.5:1:3.5 and y’s the same...
Instead of having x and y start at 0 have them start at 0.5, they can still count in increments of 1 like before: x=0.5:1:3.5; and y=0.5:1:3.5;
Thanks for trying, but this was one of the first things I tried. [It doesn't produce anything different from my first iteration, only shifts the axis.](https://i.imgur.com/NASMfjG.png)
&gt;`WinningNumber=randn(1,1000);` I don't think you know how `randn()` works. Have you read the documentation for it? &gt;`y=WinningNumber;` What is purpose of this line? &gt;`counter = 0;` You never use this variable. Surely the editor is underlining it in yellow to alert you to this fact? You should pay attention to these warnings, they exist for a reason. &gt;`finish = false;` You set this again later on, but only to `false` again, and it never impacts anything in the code. What is its purpose? &gt;`while y~=WinningNumber` This won't do what you want. You need to read the documentation for `randn`. Neither of these is a scalar, and even if they were, this would always be false because you set `y=WinningNumber;` just a few lines ago.
&gt;When you assign x to an input, you created a variable for the player's number with out creating a variable 'PlayerNumber'. There is nothing wrong with players input being a variable named `x` besides maybe a code style preference. That is not why this code fails.
&gt; function outputArg1 = averageColumn(inputArg1, inputArg2) &gt; %inputArg1 = an m x n matrix &gt; % inputArg2 = the column# to average &gt; % outputArg1 = the column average, or zero if all the values happen to be zero You can name input and output arguments anything you like. You don't have to make your variable names intentionally confusing like this. You should know the meaning and purpose of a variable just by reading its name. &gt; for inputArg2 = 1:50 I thought "inputArg2 = the column# to average". What do you think its value is now? &gt; for rowNum = 1:50 &gt; if inputArg1(rowNum, inputArg2) &gt; 0 &gt; inputArg1(rowNum, inputArg2) = inputArg1(rowNum, inputArg2); What do you think this does? &gt; else &gt; inputArg1(rowNum, inputArg2) = NaN; &gt; end &gt; end You need to read the documentation on logical indexing. &gt; outputArg1 = nanmean(inputArg1, inputArg2); What do you think this does? What are the values of `inputArg1` and `inputArg2`? How many times will this line be executed and what will happen to `outputArg1` each time? &gt; end &gt; end &gt; &gt;and the code I have for the matrix in a separate file is: &gt; &gt; inputArg1 = randi([-10 10],50,50) &gt; &gt; for inputArg2 = 1:50 &gt; outputArg1 = averageColumn(inputArg1, inputArg2) &gt; end What do you think happens on each iteration of this loop? Does the output of your function change at all for different values of `inputArg2`? Have you tested this function before just using it inside the loop? If not, why? What do you think happens to the value of `outputArg1` at each loop iteration?
What you want it to do, and what you actually do with it aren't the same unless you make it that way. Matlab doesn't know or care what you mean. It only knows what you write.
&gt;x=0:1:3; &gt;y=0:1:3; You said you want your axes to go from 1 to 4, instead you write this from 0 to 3. Why? &gt;[X,Y]=meshgrid(x,y); &gt;z=[190.4, 192.7, 192.7, 185.7; 226.7, 222.4, 227.0, 219.4; 269.5, 261.5, 278.9, 264.5; 261.0, 266.6, 285.7, 276.6] &gt;contourf(X,Y,z,100) Are you sure you want to use `contour`? &gt;[This is the result](https://i.imgur.com/Aq5SYbR.png). Yup that's exactly what you told Matlab to do. &gt;My problem is that I need the grid to be 4x4, Your grid is 4x4. &gt;not 3x3 (had to constrain to 3x3 otherwise dimensions were invalid) Your `z` array is 4x4 so you'd get an invalid dimensions error if your axes were 3x3 &gt;and all the data points from z matrix centered on the respective boxes as per the first picture. You should read the documentation for `contour`. I'm not sure it's what you want for this. &gt; &gt;How do I set the first data point to start at (0.5,0.5) not (0,0) Your first image implies you want it to start at 1, not 0.5. Which is it? &gt;while including another column of boxes and still keep the correct dimensions? You only have a 4x4 array of data. If you want an extra column you'd need to make `z` into a 4x5 array. &gt;I can't for the life of me find the relevant answers on google. Hopefully one of you good fellows can help me out, thanks. Google can't help you when the problem is thinking carefully about what you're doing. You seem to be writing code without a clear idea of what each line is supposed to do. Think about what you are asking of Matlab versus what you want to ask for. Read documentation when you're not sure what something does.
Are you being purposely obtuse? &gt;You said you want your axes to go from 1 to 4, instead you write this from 0 to 3. Why? I never said this. I want my axis to be on a 4x4 square ranging from 0 to 4. I want my data points to start at (0.5,0.5) and continue normally for a 4x4 matrix with 1 unit increments. I originally made my x and y matrices as x = 0:1:4 and similarly for y, but as you know that will make it a 5x5, so for purely testing purposes I set it back to have 4 boxes, hence arriving at 0:1:3. &gt;Your first image implies you want it to start at 1, not 0.5. Which is it? The first picture is not showing any axis, just box numbers. I want to sit my data points centred in the boxes and propagate the heat map outward. I'm sorry my hasty sketch was ambiguous but I feel you're not really trying to help any way. Regardless, I have solved my own problem, not in any conventional sense, just by padding extra data, so there is no need for you to waste everyone's time by replying.
Yes, I'm... Life is not fair. I was extremely honest before but life hits you if you are that honest. Learning MATLAB wouldn't be an important skill for now and I have other exams I need to do. Yes, If you can help me to finish this in a couple of hours, I would be your servant, yeah I'm that low.
I just didn't get what I am supposed to do? What the homework asking about? What should I do in steps?
Look up newton-raphson's and/or simpson's rule. Understand what are the inputs and the outputs of the mathematical formulas. Implement them on Matlab. It should be easy. [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68885-the-newton-raphson-method](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68885-the-newton-raphson-method) [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28726-simpson-s-rule-integration](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28726-simpson-s-rule-integration) Above are two Matlab code for Newton-raphson and Simpson's rules. You may use them as reference. &amp;#x200B; Good luck!
&gt;I never said this. I want my axis to be on a 4x4 square ranging from 0 to 4. Numbers ranging from 0 to 4 in steps of 1 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 5 numbers. If you want 4 numbers in that same range your step size has to be larger. The most convenient way to generate a sequence like this is with `linspace()`. &gt;I want my data points to start at (0.5,0.5) and continue normally for a 4x4 matrix with 1 unit increments. 0:3 or 0:1:3 would yield 4 values, but explicitly asks for the starting value to be zero, not 0.5. Matlab doesn't know what you want, only what you write. &gt;&gt;Your first image implies you want it to start at 1, not 0.5. Which is it? &gt; &gt;The first picture is not showing any axis, just box numbers. I want to sit my data points centred in the boxes and propagate the heat map outward. I'm sorry my hasty sketch was ambiguous but I feel you're not really trying to help any way. I took your post at face value. Don't blame people trying to help you because you've been unclear in your question. Propagating data outside your original array is extrapolation. This is tricky in general, but if this is thermal data presumably you have a model that makes it possible in this case. There's no built-in plotting function for this however. &gt;Regardless, I have solved my own problem, not in any conventional sense, just by padding extra data, so there is no need for you to waste everyone's time by replying. That doesn't do what you originally asked, but if it works for you then great. Sorry I upset you by answering your question. You might want to work on that before you enter the professional world. I wouldn't be likely to hire somebody who behaved that way during an interview.
What’re the values for NphaseTN and NphaseTP?
Not near a pc, so I can't confirm, but try moving the "hold on" to right after the figure call, instead of after the first plot in the loop.
You're most welcome.
I dont think thats feasable in a funny way. You;de need to load the waveform as an array into matlab, which would require opening a song file with matlab, probably defeating the purpose of your joke. this works though load handel sound(y,Fs)
Thanks, I thought it was a long shot, but all I could do was try.
I just played that code, it's awesome.
Your "colors" vector isn't formatted correctly. Because you put those srtings in a vector, the content is 'r*b*g*', that is, it is a 6-element long vector of characters (rather than a 3 element long vector of strings). Try using a {cell array} instead - colors={'r*', 'b*', 'g*'}; and plot(au_xvector(i), phaseshiftvec(i), colors{i}); hold on;
nice : ), in the past i have used the "halleluja" bit from that clip as a sound to play when my calculation was done. Got me every time XD
FYI, indent 4 spaces instead of placing ticks around each line. Reformatted: CorrectedthreePhasedots=figure(3); au_xvector=[-1, 0, 1]; phaseshiftvec=[NphaseTN, NphaseT0, NphaseTP]; colors=['r*', 'b*', 'g*']; for i=1:length(au_xvector); figure(CorrectedthreePhasedots); plot(au_xvector(i), phaseshiftvec(i), colors(i)); hold on; end figure(CorrectedthreePhasedots); grid on; legend('Zero Flow', 'Reverse Flow', 'Forward Flow'); title({'Phase Shifts Associated with 3 different Flow Directions'}); ylabel ('Phase Shift w/respect to zero flow pulse (radians)'); ylim([-1,1]); xlabel ('vector indicies (indicies, a.u.)'); Your colors need to be in a cell array, not a matrix. Take a look: &gt;&gt; colors=['r*', 'b*', 'g*'] colors = 'r*b*g*' You're concatenating characters, which produces one long array. So your loop iterations use the following values: * loop 1: `colors(1)` which is `'r'` * loop 2: `colors(2)` which is `'*'` * loop 3: `colors(2)` which is `'b'` Use a cell array instead and reference via `colors{i}`.
`y.*shiftdim(x,-1)`
You need the .wav, mp3 file... use wavread.
So I adjusted some things in the code but still am getting the scientific notation.
Check out Matlab's [profiler](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/profiling-for-improving-performance.html), which you can use to record execution time and see what lines of code are taking the most time.
You can use 'tic;' and 'toc;' to test the speed of a single line, or if you want more information, try 'profile viewer' to start the profiler which will let you see how fast/slow the two methods are. In truth, I expect the slowest part to be the loop itself. If you can find a way to vectorize one of the two methods, that will probably be the biggest speed boost you can get.
Yes, and you always will. The [Wikipedia article on floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) is a good starting point for understanding why that happens, in particular [the section on representable numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Representable_numbers,_conversion_and_rounding). The number 0.1 is simply not representable in binary. If you'd just like to avoid presenting that "ugly" number to your user, you can round the value displayed by using the second argument of the [`round`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/round.html) function.
That's what I tried to do, it stops at zero if I do that.
Of course it does! Your inner while loop condition tells it to "stop" (it's not really stopping, but that's what it looks like on the screen). If that's not what you want, then you'll need to change that condition. Again, think about the value of `sec` as you go through iterations of the loop; it is used to determine if you will stay in the inner loop or return to the outer loop. If you have a strong aversion to pencil and paper, you can [use a breakpoint](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html#buvyxwj) to watch the code work. You can mouse over the variables to see what value they hold, and you can select a bit of code and press F9 to evaluate it in the command window. Try doing this with your inner while condition when `sec` is zero. Note also that I didn't suggest that you round the number for computation, just for display.
On a call, can't test the audio, but this should work: url = 'http://digitalmidnight.org/aster/temp/Cyberpunkish/Darude%20-%20Sandstorm.mp3' outfilename = websave('sandstorm.mp3',url) [y,Fs] = audioread( outfilename ) ; sound( y , Fs )
`M=gallery('circul',x)';`
Where is AppGrid declared, and what is the value in max_R?
"color" has non-1x1 size
I’m sorry, i am familiar with C and Matlab but I’m not sure what you meant by vectorizing these methods. Can you link me to an example?
&gt;url = 'http://digitalmidnight.org/aster/temp/Cyberpunkish/Darude%20-%20Sandstorm.mp3' outfilename = websave('sandstorm.mp3',url) \[y,Fs\] = audioread( outfilename ) ; sound( y , Fs ) This is awesome and so handy
This is fantastic
I'd probably use fopen, fseek, fread, etc. that way you can process the file's contents in exactly how you want. CSV's are just comma-delimited files so it shouldn't be hard to parse the data manually this way
Have you seen the “readtable” function? Use that with “uigetfile” will probably get you what you need.
You could do a 2D histogram (the “histogram2” function) of the data, where the x axis is longitude, and the y axis is latitude. You should probably make sure you account for the fact that the area of a lat/lon square depends on the square’s lat. You can color and adjust the transparency of the bars with the ‘FaceColor’ and ‘FaceAlpha’ properties. Alternatively, you can use “[X,Y,Z]=sphere(...)” to get the coordinates for a spherical mesh. You can then use “surf(X,Y,Z,C)” where “C” is colored according to the bins. A third option, that might be the easiest and best solution since you have so few points relative to the surface area, is to use “plot3” to place a dot where each of your data points is. Hope this helps!
Yup.
I believe you are referring to EDEM, one of our technology partners. Is that correct? https://www.edemsimulation.com/techpartner/mathworks/ If so, it appears that EDEM recommends that you engage with MathWorks Consulting Services: https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html I recommend speaking with your university's software tools team, who can connect you with our Sales team.
Did you bother inspecting these variables in the workspace? The error message you received couldn't be more clear if it rented a billboard across the street from your house.
xlsread, readtable, etc.
The error is that you posted the same question twice, one after the other.
You'll need to tell us more about the object called "HRV_data". Clearly, (size(HRV_data{2},2)+1) and size(HRV_data{3},2) must be the same.
HRV_data contains 4 matrices of different column size. They don’t necessarily have to be equal. The first expression is adding 1 to the number of columns in ‘HRV_data{2}’, while the second expression is simply the number of columns in ‘HRV_data{3}’. The index of ‘HRV_data’ points to different matrices
Adding info on HRV_data to the OP
There's also a Mapping Toolbox in Matlab. Might want to look into that.
doc &gt; Matlab &gt; Desktop Tools and Development Environment &gt; Editing and Debugging M-Files doc &gt; Matlab &gt; Programming Fundamentals &gt; Error Handling Note: May differ depending on your Matlab version.
Heart rate variability?
yep
What's the expected behaviour? Are you trying to loop over all of the values of these matrices? If so, you might want to look into the documentation for the `size` function, look at what it returns (at least a `1x2` array), and then compare that to how loops work. You're not actually looping through the elements of any of these arrays, each loop is just running twice. Once where `i` is the total number of rows, and once where `i` is the total number of columns.
I've never used it, but you might benefit from tabularTextDatastore. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.io.datastore.tabulartextdatastore.html https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/read-and-analyze-data-in-a-tabulartextdatastore.html
My guess is that size(HRV\_data{1},2)+1) is larger than (size(HRV\_data{2},2)
Oh duh shit thats right. Thanks
Thank you for your answer. Yes, you are right, it is EDEM. I understood you. I will connect with our specialists, but I think it will be so long...
new to matlab 2019a is matlab projects. within a project you can reference other projects(say where certain utility functions located). also i believe you create checkpoints for reference projects to see if they have changed and compare differences. see more here: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/add-or-remove-a-reference-to-another-project.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/add-or-remove-a-reference-to-another-project.html)
You could try creating common folders for your functions organized by version number, and then create a utility function which accepts a version and then changes the path in the caller function setupgenerics(v) switch(v) case &lt;version&gt;: evalin('caller', 'addpath(''&lt;folder&gt;'')'); ... end end Add that function to your global path so you can use it whenever. You can then call it to add the version of generic functions you want to your path. If you want to add them globally on a MATLAB version-basis you could create a startup.m file and add a call to that function with arguments based on results from `verLessThan`. Hope this helps!
You cannot do such thing directly. The way I would proceed will be create a basic app with the required UI components. Once you have that done, you will have a script of the GUI where you can include the most part of your other script in order to do the desired process. Also, you will have to declare the variables with the prefix app. (for example app.variable1) in case you want to be pass it to the function of an UI component. Btw, I think MATLAB has some tutorials.
Guide
This is literally what the path is for. Put all your library functions in a folder and add that folder to your path. Done. It's extra convenient if your work place has network shared drives. Just put your library folder on the network and you can access it from everywhere.
Just stumbled across this subreddit. This was an exact assignment I had in college. Is this for UCD Engineering by any chance?
&gt;Edit: ‘HRV_data’ is a 1x4 Cell... Yet you repeatedly index it like `HRV_data{2,2};` with two subscripts. What would this mean for a 1x4 array?
Was only looking at the second row of HRV_data in that section of the code. It’s changed now tho
I have done that.....
I also use MATLAB/Simulink every day and have my useful functions/scripts organized in package folders. See here: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab\_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html) That way I have one top level folder, e.g. "Tools", then sub-folders for various tasks, e.g. +Tools/+Simulink/DiagramCleanup.m or +Tools/+Plots/ComplicatedPlot.m Add +Tools and sub-folders to your MATLAB path (or whatever you name your folders), in command window type : `Tools.XyzFolder.NameOfFunction(input1, input2)` I have to use SVN for work, so I created a local repository to store all of my scripts/functions in version control. Easy to tag/branch/switch for specific changes then.
Actually I’m at Middle Tennessee State University’s Mechatronics Engineering program (sorry, it’s probably the longest name). Unfortunately, my teacher has said if it doesn’t work I get a 0 even with all the hours upon hours I’ve put into it.
I take back my words, this is reasonably funny
Another approach that doesn't involve scopes or To Workspace (which are good options) is to use the "Save to workspace or file" menu in the Configuration Parameters window. From here, you can enable saving model outputs and states (and any additional signals you wish to "log"). I recommend using the "Single simulation output" option. &amp;#x200B; Let's say you enable "Single simulation output" and save to a variable called "out" (which is a SimulationOutput object) and enable "Output" to be saved to a variable called "yout" (which will be included as a component of the "out" variable). &amp;#x200B; To plot "yout", you could do something like: &amp;#x200B; `plot(out.yout{1}.Values.Time,out.yout{1}.Values.Data)` &amp;#x200B; This is a fairly common approach in industry for those looking to plot Simulink simulation outputs using MATLAB, especially for embedded applications (where you are generating C from the models). &amp;#x200B; That being said - definitely look into the Simulation Data Inspector.
First of all have you had a course on control systems? like you know about transfer functions?
Use linearzied second order system equations to solve for the gains that would give those performance requirements. MATLAB has a great SISO toolbox that you could use for this. Kinda a rough assignment if you haven't used simulink. but there's plenty of tutorials online. [http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home)
Does it have to be done in Matlab? This would be pretty easy to do in motionview
Find out the closed loop transfer function using the settling time and phase difference that's given and proceed with a normal simulink/Matlab simulation from there
i don't have motion view or know how to use that software.
you can find a list of file formats supported by matlab [here](https://imgur.com/XEVGmd4).. stl doesnt seem to be included in this but you can always try to use the import wizard which determines what kind of file you are importing and suggests ways to represent the data
Okay, so I copied most of my code into the callback functions and it's working fine for the most part, except one function, triplot(). This is opening up a new plot instead of plotting on the UI axes that's present. The function does not even allow me to specify which axes to plot it on. Do you know any solution for this?
Do you have any reason to suspect that the call to [`cla`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cla.html) may be responsible?
Can you send me the code? I will try to fix it and send you back.
The `cla` is only there to clear the graph when the graph button is pushed again. Also tried to remove the `cla` from there but it didn't do anything I needed it to do.The structure gets the work done only if I only need to graph 1 by 1. I could've used a radio button for that. It doesn't really work when multiple checkboxes are ticked, only one of the ticked boxes work.
The problem I think is that you are not saying in which figure do you want to plot. For example: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% function display\_data(app,x,y) plot(app.UIAxes,x,y) end %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where app.UIAxes is the tag for the UI Axes component and x,y are the variables that you want to plot.
 path_to_weinerOutput = 'out_wien.wav'; [audio, fs] = audioread(path_to_weinerOutput); [S,F,T] = specgram(audio); T = T/max(T); S = 10 .* log10(abs(S)); [TF1] = imregionalmin(S); %TF1 = (S &lt;= -10) &amp; (S ~= -inf); % P = P ./ max(P); % TF1 = TF1 .* (P &lt;= 0.2); myAxe = app.UIAxes4; myAxe.XLabel.String = 'Time'; myAxe.YLabel.String = 'Normalized frequency'; myAxe.XLim = [0 1]; myAxe.YLim = [0 1]; imagesc(myAxe,T,F,S); hold(myAxe, 'on'); [I, J] = find(TF1); I = (I/max(I)) .* max(T); J = (J/max(J)).* max(F); plot(myAxe,I, J, 'r*'); dt = delaunayTriangulation(I, J); triplot(dt);
Sounds about right. So `hold` can't work between button presses because `cla` gets rid of everything, and because you're not managing checkboxes programmatically, which would be one possible approach if you wanted to press the button repeatedly. Your conditional structure plots one plot and then the callback function ends because all of the plot commands are buried in the same tree, and there's no loop or anything to make it enter any of the other branches. If you want the program to do something different, you'll have to address some subset of those concerns.
try with myAxe = app.UIAxes4; myAxe.NextPlot = 'add'; myAxe.XLabel.String = 'Time'; myAxe.YLabel.String = 'Normalized frequency'; myAxe.XLim = [0 1]; myAxe.YLim = [0 1]; imagesc(myAxe,T,F,S);
Ohhh I see... Can you help me or give me a clue on how I should start the loop? Sorry if I'm asking too much I'm just a beginner in matlab. This GUI homework is too much for me haha.
Still facing the same issue. I even changed hold on to hold all
It seems like you've got the GUI part down okay, it's the logic that's tripping you up. Let's use an analogy. When I get ready to leave, I'd like to make sure I have my wallet and keys. The way you've written the callback right now it goes kind of like this: If I don't have my keys, I should get my keys, otherwise if I don't have my wallet, I should get my wallet, then I can leave. What if I don't have either? If I don't have my keys, then I should get my keys and leave because the "otherwise" part doesn't apply... that doesn't seem right, does it? One way to fix it would be to go over the list again afterward. So if I don't have my keys I get my keys. Now we check again. Since i have my keys, the "otherwise" part applies and now since I don't have my wallet I get my wallet. We check one more time and since I have my keys and my wallet, I can leave. But is that the best way? What about if I do the checks separately? If I don't have my keys, I get my keys. If I don't have my wallet, I get my wallet. Now I can leave. Hope that helps.
Okay I have made a small script simulating what you want to do, and all is plotted in the same figure. Try not to rename the UIAxes callback function: path_to_weinerOutput = 'out_wien.wav'; [audio, fs] = audioread(path_to_weinerOutput); [S,F,T] = specgram(audio); T = T/max(T); S = 10 .* log10(abs(S)); [TF1] = imregionalmin(S); %TF1 = (S &lt;= -10) &amp; (S ~= -inf); app.UIAxes4.XLabel.String = 'Time'; app.UIAxes4.YLabel.String = 'Normalized frequency'; app.UIAxes4.XLim = [0 1]; app.UIAxes4.YLim = [0 1]; imagesc(app.UIAxes4,T,F,S); hold(myAxe, 'on'); [I, J] = find(TF1); I = (I/max(I)) .* max(T); J = (J/max(J)) .* max(F); plot(app.UIAxes4, I, J, 'r*'); dt = delaunayTriangulation(I, J); triplot(dt);
I kind of get it now but I still don't know what kind of loop and how I will start it :(
If you want to go the loop route, that's okay, but it will be harder and slightly more computationally expensive than the last option I suggested above. Since there are only three possibilities, you could use a [`for`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html?searchHighlight=for&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle) loop and keep everything else the way it is. I'd strongly recommend trying to understand the third option I suggested above, as it will be clearer to read, and easier to implement.
WOW I finally got it!! Thanks man! I honestly thought I needed a loop to access the other checkboxes because only one always gets plotted. I thought about what you said and I think I got it because its finally working haha.
You're most welcome.
Okay, I think this should works: Create a new triplot function called triplot\_modified as follows: &amp;#x200B; %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% function hh = triplot\_modified(tri,UI\_Axes,varargin) %TRIPLOT Plots a 2D triangulation % TRIPLOT(TRI,X,Y) displays the triangles defined in the % M-by-3 matrix TRI. A row of TRI contains indices into X,Y that % define a single triangle. The default line color is blue. % % TRIPLOT(TR) displays the triangles in the triangulation TR. % % TRIPLOT(...,COLOR) uses the string COLOR as the line color. % % H = TRIPLOT(...) returns a line handle representing the displayed % triangles edges. % % TRIPLOT(...,'param','value','param','value'...) allows additional % line param/value pairs to be used when creating the plot. % % Example 1: % X = rand(10,2); % dt = delaunayTriangulation(X); % triplot(dt) % % Example 2: % % Plotting a Delaunay triangulation in face-vertex format % X = rand(10,2); % dt = delaunayTriangulation(X); % tri = dt(:,:); % triplot(tri, X(:,1), X(:,2)); % % See also TRISURF, TRIMESH, DELAUNAY, triangulation, delaunayTriangulation. &amp;#x200B; % Copyright 1984-2015 The MathWorks, Inc. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; narginchk(1,inf); &amp;#x200B; start = 1; &amp;#x200B; if isa(tri, 'TriRep') if tri.size(1) == 0 error(message('MATLAB:triplot:EmptyTri')); elseif tri.size(2) \~= 3 error(message('MATLAB:triplot:NonTriangles')); end x = tri.X(:,1); y = tri.X(:,2); edges = tri.edges(); if (nargin == 1) || (mod(nargin-1,2) == 0) c = 'blue'; else c = varargin{1}; start = 2; end elseif isa(tri, 'triangulation') if tri.size(1) == 0 error(message('MATLAB:triplot:EmptyTri')); elseif tri.size(2) \~= 3 error(message('MATLAB:triplot:NonTriangles')); end x = tri.Points(:,1); y = tri.Points(:,2); edges = tri.edges(); if (nargin == 1) || (mod(nargin-1,2) == 0) c = 'blue'; else % c = varargin{1}; c = 'blue'; % start = 2; end else x = varargin{1}; y = varargin{2}; warnState = warning('off','MATLAB:triangulation:PtsNotInTriWarnId'); tr = triangulation(tri,x(:),y(:)); warning(warnState); edges = tr.edges(); if (nargin == 3) || (mod(nargin-3,2) == 0) c = 'blue'; start = 3; else c = varargin{3}; start = 4; end end &amp;#x200B; x = x(edges)'; y = y(edges)'; nedges = size(x,2); x = \[x; NaN(1,nedges)\]; y = \[y; NaN(1,nedges)\]; x = x(:); y = y(:); h = plot(UI\_Axes,x,y,c,varargin{start:end}); if nargout == 1, hh = h; end %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% &amp;#x200B; and in your main sript called as triplot\_modified(dt,myAxe);
+ Thanks a lot
Here's the approach I would take for this (this would be done in a loop, continuously comparing the image at one timestep with the image in the next timestep): 1. [Remove noise](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/noise-removal.html) (I know you say it's not noise, but for the purposes of alignment it still is) 2. Use SURF feature detection to find points of interest in the image, and keep only the strongest of those features [\(more details/examples.\)](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/detectsurffeatures.html) Match the SURF features between image at time t and t+1. 3. [Estimate the geometric transformation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/estimategeometrictransform.html) using the matching of those points. 4. Apply the geometric transform to the *original* image (before any noise reduction etc.)
I remember something like filename = "data"; save(filename); And this will directly save a .dat file to your current directory
You said it only has one row
So I would have it do the save file at the end and then add the open data file function in beginning?
Yes
Currently trying to figure out how to sneak it into my coworkers' `startup.m`s
Diary function will save your output to text file. Diary('filename.txt') Diary on Your code here Diary off
I’m relatively new to MATLAB and been working on this code for 4 hours and now my mind is all twisted thinking about getting it to save and updating the variables every time it’s ran. I’m trying to save the text with data at the end with a table like fashion with players in top row and stats on the left columns and read the file when the program starts but I’m getting errors that I don’t know what it means cause of lack of knowledge in MATLAB.
I don't know how to do that. good luck. diary will save all of your outputs, maybe you can write a shell script that will take care of compiling all the answers into your desired table... but I know bash more than matlab as well.
Using built-in functions? `[v, d] = eigs(sparse(A)\conj(A));` ... is something I used the other day and accounts for a few thousand lines of code right there. Maybe something with `pdepe`, hrmmm... Without built-in functions except for operators with, "simple," syntax? Maybe something with complex numbers, logical indexing, implicit expansion and some easily vectorized operations... `y(a &gt; a0) = A(a &gt; a0, a &gt; a0) \ (1i * f(a &gt; a0) .* x(a &gt; a0)' + (1 + 1i));`
Anything with tables and rowfun() with grouping variables allows to get rid of nested for loops as well as their setup and initialization. Same with join() operations.
I'm trying to follow what you want to do: For each month, you want to multiply the PredictedTemp for that year by all 12 ratios so your end result is a length 12 vector for each year t? What do you mean "steps down to multiply by a new temp 12 times and so on...?" What size array do you want out? Just to note, your for loops now do this exactly: GeoTemp = PredictedTemp*ratioVec
The most complex code I have been able to simplify has been when I have had to access structures and cell/numeric arrays to concatenate data. The use of the {struct/cell/array}fun() functions is a great tool, and I have done some complicated accesses that have involved nesting some calls together and some other data manipulation at the same time, such as these: `da = arrayfun(@(x) vertcat(structfun(@(x) x, x.metric(i), 'UniformOutput', 0)), stuRes);` `da = arrayfun(@(x) structfun(@(x) x(1), x.metric(k), 'UniformOutput', 0), stuRes);` `de = cellfun(@(x) retVal(x, maxCourseNum), arrayfun(@(x) x.nodat, da, 'UniformOutput', 0), 'UniformOutput', 0);` (This last one does make use of a function I defined separately just to make the code more readable, but it could have been done on the same line since it is just returning `[x, nan(1, maxCourseNum-length(x))];`). This greatly simplified the code from some complex loops into one line statements to get all the data I needed from the various structures into something I could plot.
This is precisely what package folders are for, whether or not you use OOP. There are few caveats: 1. Folder names must start with a plus sign, e.g. "+mytools". 2. Functions/classes must be called with dot notation (mytools.functionA) or loaded with the "import" command. 3. Imports are specific to the current workspace! Imports in the command window, for example, do not migrate to function workspaces. 4. Package functions that call other package functions can be tricky if you change directory names a lot. Some forethought about naming goes a long way...
Yes for example I have a column vec of 10 predicted temperatures. I want to multiply the temp values by each month interval (12 in total) giving me a total of 120 values in the new column. Does that make sense? Sorry it's kinda hard to follow
This seems like a job for comsol not matlab
I don't know if I'm fully understanding your question right not, but the following code results in a 12x10 matrix with each column representing a single ratioVec value multiplied by every GeoTemp vector. ratioVec = (1:10)'; GeoTemp = (1:12)'; multipliedVal = zeros(length(GeoTemp),length(ratioVec)); for i = 1:length(ratioVec) multipliedVal(:,i) = ratioVec(i).*GeoTemp; end If you want to keep the data stored as a column vector, then you can just use the reshape command to transform the previous matrix into a column vector. multipliedVal = reshape(multipliedVal,length(ratioVec)*length(GeoTemp),1);
Why are you using the variable t in two different contexts (line 1 and 8). Your original time variable gets changed to temperature in the for loop. You can rectify this and comment whether the problem persists.
So, let's see if I'm understanding this correctly. 1. What you have are two vectors A of length m and B of length n. 2. You want to get a matrix X of size m-by-n (or n-by-m, doesn't really matter here). 3. The elements of matrix X are x\_i,j where 1&lt;=i&lt;=m and 1&lt;=j&lt;=n. 4. x\_i,j is a product of a\_i and b\_j (or more generally a function, again doesn't really matter). Is my interpretation correct?
Thank you for your help. The SURF feature also detects the noise no matter how much I filter it. I am working on just selecting the teeth part. I will update once I figure out the whole process. Once again I appreciate your help. Thank you.
1. Crop or make a selection of a reference image of the teeth. 2. Run a cross correlation of the reference image and the rest of the images. 3. You should be able to get output of where the cross correlation of the reference is highest. Use that to resize/imcrop the images.
https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/xcorr2.html Kind of like Where's Waldo with a reference of the Waldo you are looking for.
Sure, if you pay me like, two thousand euro or so.

I just skimmed this, but I think you want to connect to a serial device and this is code that does it for other platforms? Try this: https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/getting-started-with-serial-i-o.html
I really love tables for this reason. The downside is the processing overhead, also the fact that parfor really doesn't like tables. I'd really like to see tables optimized further, to bring performance for operations on table columns closer to performance for operations on an array of the column's underlying type.

I forget the exact names of these mechanisms, but bwconncomp() may help you. The idea there is to turn the image completely black and white (each pixel is just on or off) and find a few of the the largest connected components (the largest piece of continuous white). Play around with the sensitivity, and that should ignore the noise and only use the outline of the teeth on the bottom. From there, you could use that for stabilization instead.
Yes the module we are studying is control systems however the training we have had compared to the assignment question is completely different. &amp;#x200B; I do know about transfer functions however using them in terms of matlab and simulink my knowledge is basic.

Specifically through Matlab? Sisotool is a good start: https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/controlsystemdesigner-app.html
Yeah I’m disappointed that mathwork doesn’t make all these functions parallalized internally since they would easily lend themselves to this... it tried to modify them for this but it’s a mess.
The two commands that will be helpful for you will be **isnan** and **find**. Depending on your proficiency with matlab you may need to use a loop, however, with a bit of reading on logical indexing, no loop is probably required to figure it out. Good luck.
I agree with the other comment about **isnan** and **find**, although I have not written code to do this particular example per se. Alternatively, if you really want to you could write the data to a .csv or .xls file and then use excel to look for that information if you want a more user friendly type of environment. **But be warned,** this will noticeably increase your program's execution time. I typically avoid writing to an .xls or .csv file if I can and would rather copy+paste to a .txt file in notepad++. &amp;#x200B; Also writing to .txt files is a bit faster I think... but you would have to open the .txt file in excel anyways to analyze it and honestly by the time you try to involve excel you're better off figuring out how to do the **isnan** or **find** idea mentioned by another user. But there are multiple ways to do this if you want something different. Options are always nice.
This is absolutely what I was thinking about as well minus the bwconncomp() part. I will try it. Thanks.
I am definitely trying this method as well. Thank you for your suggestion.
Good luck!
PID without a PhD is a classic. Yeah, it's digital. Your proportional, integral, and derivative coefficients work the same, though. https://m.eet.com/media/1112634/f-wescot.pdf
Why is there any difference between txt and csv? Eitherway it's just ascii file with delimiters. The fastest way to store data on a drive is using binary files, but I don't think the files would be loadable in anything else.
`B = A(A(:,2)==1 | isnan(A(:,2)));`

You'll need a loop if you only want the NANs that are after the 1s. I'd do something like an enable that activates when you encounter a 1 and deactivates when you encounter a non 1 or non NAN. Something along the lines of this: EN1 = 0 For i=1:94 If A(i,2) == 1 || (isnan(A(i,2)) &amp;&amp; EN1 == 1) % store your value EN1 = 1 else EN1 = 0 end end

Could you please be a bit more vague about what your question is?
It’s hard when I can’t uploads the code
I need to administer 60 ml/hr of fluid to an existing code and I don’t know how to model it
You need to administer 60 ml/hr of fluid to an existing code?? What does you mean administer fluid to a code?
You have a circulatory system containing a certain volume of fluid. Every hour, the volume increases by 60 mL.
Do you know how to do this by hand? Or do you need the code to do this? It would probably be a good idea of how these things are calculated so you can debug yourself. I don't know anything about cams, but if you have the equations this can be figured out. I think this is where you need to start

I think you are confusing MatLab and Tinder
Swipe left (or right? dunno) and hope for the best (or worst, dunno)
It may not be the answer you are looking for, but the help docs say that if you want to avoid saving your figs when using save(), you need to remove them from the the workspace first. That includes if they are nested somewhere inside a struct. :/ ...A slightly more complicated way would be to build an index of all the variables you want to save, then use the index as an input argument for save().
It looks like you just copy and pasted your whole homework assignment... you don’t have a reason it doesn’t work?
Dates can be difficult to work with as names in Matlab. Try numbering them?
You can define what you are saving. It’s something like... Save(‘filename’, variable1, variable2, etc..)
Does .available and .read does the same thing in arduino and matlab?
Have you seen this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/462uwe/submitting_homework_questions_read_this/ If it runs and then fails, just look at the error output of MATLAB. If it runs and fails to do what it should, where have you traced the error back to? Where is it encountered?
Have you used simulink? I haven’t used it very much, but i found it a powerful tool. Dig in to this topic for a week and you’ll probably find your answer and get a few NG+ rounds of Matlab and image processing.
I haven't this would be my first time. Guess ill dig on deeper!
Apparantly the function you want to use does not exist. My matlab doesn't know it either. [https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14067-ws2struct](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14067-ws2struct) Here it is gives the function code; you can try to use this to remake it. My guess is they took the function out of matlab between 2014 and now.
If this question would have an answer us engineering students would have a lot less trouble finding a girlfriend
&gt;tried different parameters There's your problem right there. You're supposed to vary the hyperparameters. Varying your parameters will never solve the problem. I'll also give you a hint to your problem. Perceptrons can be made into NAND gates, and NAND gates are universal gates. In other words, a XOR gate can be made from NAND gates.
It looks like linspace won't work, because the last number is larger than the middle number. The last number says, how big the steps are
What do you mean by hyperparameters? I'm sorry for asking these kinds of question, but the professor didn't really explain anything. He just showed us how to train a simple perceptron network to do AND and OR functions with the nntool. &gt;I'll also give you a hint to your problem. Perceptrons can be made into NAND gates, and NAND gates are universal gates. In other words, a XOR gate can be made from NAND gates. I understand that I can make XOR out of NAND gates and adjust weights and biases on nodes so they can do the logic you want, but I can't find them in the nntool. I'm only familiar with the "New..." window and the "Network" and "Data" tabs in it.
Python overall is a more versatile language. But it's not true the math libraries are superior. Looking at benchmarks, MATLAB doesn't do too bad with some algorithms. Python is downright terrible by some measures.
If the velocities are incorrect you shouldn't really be presenting them or including them in any analysis and it would be pointless to log scale so these values are included. So I'd suggest a filtering method of some sort. Not sure how your data is set up but I'd assume something along the lines of \[Time; x position; y position; velocity x; velocity y;\], in which case you could have a look at temporal or spatial filtering. &amp;#x200B; Or go as simple as establishing the maximum feasible velocity and apply a threshold filter to remove all data above this. It really depends what you're investigating, but if you're extracting statistics from the dataset you do need to remove these velocities that 'don't make sense' if they're noise from the particle tracking method.
If you're doing engineering calculations or prototyping, MATLAB code is faster to write and quite performant. If you're building some large, maintainable application, Python is probably the better choice. So, learn both. MATLAB is pretty easy. So is Python.
I think MATLAB is very useful to know well if you even plan on working in industry. MATLAB is WIDELY used in industry and is an extremely useful tool for programming in science and engineering. Personally I think it is important to know both and use both where appropriate. It is what I do.
Try opening it with a "&amp;"-sign after the line in the terminal. If I remember correctly that should make it run in the background and hopefully allow you to at least close the terminal.
I switched to Python because it was free, and many places you may end up working won't shell out for a Matlab license when Python can do everything Matlab can (except maybe Simulink? Not sure on that). Python is better in just about every way, including speed. I highly recommend learning it.
Okay, I will try that. Thanks 😊
Yeah, I know. Sometimes I just want to save everything off so I can pick up where I left off in the future if need be. If I try to guess which of hundreds of variables I'll need later, I'm always wrong. I'm afraid the answer is simply to close the figures before saving. Personally, I can't really see a use case or work flow where I'd want figures to spontaneously appear when loading a mat file. I always save the figure itself if it needs to be saved and can't be readily reproduced from data in memory.
Having used both, the ease of plotting and displaying results is much easier in Matlab. Sure there’s python’s matplotlib, but I haven’t found it to be complete replacement for Matlab plotting functionality. Just my 2 cents.
Yes and no, that was my experience at first. But it's really all about learning how to set up an IDE if you want that Matlab-like functionality. I use Spyder and set the plotting backend with %matplotlib auto, and it works very similarly to Matlab. Yes, I would agree that the out-of-the-box user-friendliness of Matlab is hard to beat. But the significance of that diminishes significantly as you transition from a novice to an expert user of either language.
I think that both use Blas and Lapack libraries, so basic math is the same.
You don't get the modelling &amp; simulation experience in Python as you do in MATLAB/Simulink. &amp;#x200B; I've not experienced writing .m files for enduring applications really, you'll switch to python if you roll out your algos.
[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&amp;tz=-120&amp;q=matlab,python&amp;sni=3) should answer your question.
MATLAB has some other features like Simulink just don't exist in Python. Also, while Python has more vast libraries of machine learning tools - it often requires some digging to find the tools you're looking for. On the other hand, I appreciate how much MATLAB has built in to the default libraries. This being said, it really depends on your application, but they're both easy to pick up - so no reason to blindly stick to one of the two.
The question is strange. If you are interested in pure performances then both Matlab and python are out of the game. Use c++ plus a good library and that will always be faster. Now if your creterion is the 'coverage' of the available libraries. Then Matlab is a good choice since there are toolboxes for many things. Python has significantly better toolboxes for deep learning since all this community is developing in python. Now if the criterion is cost the python is free. Other aspect have to be considered when going for professional application. Matlab is costly but the cost ensure a good level of support. Also you have some additional feature that are mandatory in some fields such as autosar code generation, tools for code coverage, multiple embedded target. Using community developed api ofte does not guaranty the same level of code stability and compatibility. I hope this will help you to chose which approach better suits you. Do not forget free Matlab alternatives such as octave or scilab. Depending on your need you may choose one solution, but for sure there is no universal definite solution to all the people needs
I don't think there's a clear and definitive answer here. &amp;#x200B; In my experience, it's easier to write "good", manageable code in Python. Not having to have one function per file, nicer object orientation and well-defined guidelines (PEP-8 etc) all work in Python's favour. There are also tonnes of libraries out there -- Python is pretty much the industry standard in Scientific Computing. I've also found Python much easier to deploy and integrate with other applications than MATLAB, because it's such a "broad-spectrum" language. For instance, you could easily bundle up your object recognition code into a python module, import it into your Django webapp, and call off to it. This would be a bit tricker (but certainly not impossible) for a MATLAB project, as the webapp would almost certainly be written in a different language. It also makes deploying trickier, as you'd need to license MATLAB for each machine, which could get complicated with things like autoscaling. &amp;#x200B; That said, the fact that Matlab has so many toolboxes baked in can make it easier to get shit done quickly -- there's often one way of doing something, rather than having to find the appropriate Python library (from many choices). The documentation for Matlab functions is also much more consistent -- while Python's standard library is well documented, the same can't always be said for external packages. In my experience, prototyping in MATLAB can be quicker than in Python. &amp;#x200B; In terms of speed, I don't think you can necessarily say "Python is faster than Matlab" or vice-versa. Well written vectorised Matlab code will be faster than poorly written Python code, well written, vectorised Python code is going to be faster than poorly written Matlab. Matlab has vectorisation built in, but Python's Numpy library is so widely used now that it's pretty much considered part of the standard library. &amp;#x200B; Another important consideration is the cost of licensing MATLAB. Open Sourcing your MATLAB code is great (and where you can, you should!), but it's still imposes a large barrier to entry for those that aren't able to get free MATLAB licenses, or afford to buy their own. It makes your code out of reach to many would-be engineers who are less advantaged or who are hobbyists. Using an open-source language like Python minimises this barrier to entry, so can only be a good thing.
