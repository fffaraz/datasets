I'm 28, been working in SAP since 2007. I work for an oil company, so I mostly work in IS-OIL, but also some components of FI.
I was a CS major, learning some C, C++ and Java, but none to real proficiency. However, all of those are basically procedural languages, like ABAP. It probably took me a month or so to learn ABAP, but closer to 6 months to really feel comfortable in it. And that was with a background in programming. My advice is find a short online course in, say, C++. Learn the basics of if statements, loops, case/switch, functions, pointers, arrays, strings, recursion. You may want to pick up some basic SQL statements as well. Once you feel you have a handle on all that, look at the Wikipedia entry on [ABAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP). Or just google ABAP for dummies/beginners and look for a tutorial. Or, if you have some cash to burn through, you can take the SAP course on [programming in ABAP](https://training.sap.com/us/en/course/bc100-introduction-to-programming-with-abap-classroom-091-g-en/) to the tune of about $1300US. Good luck, I hope this helps!
Thank you! I'll have a look for C++ guides then. I was also just told that ABAP is very similair to COBOL so I'm going to give them both a go.
ABAP is really similar to COBOL. It also helps if you've had some background in SQL because the SELECT statements are very similar. If you'd like, I could probably send you some test specs when you're feeling more comfortable. One thing you have to keep in mind though is that there are a number of different ways you can use ABAP within the SAP system. Usually, when working on a client, you're going to deal with RICEF: R = Reports--Pull info from a database and generally output the result in an ALV grid (similar to excel spreadsheet), but can also output as lists I = Interfaces--Basically reports that are called from other programs, may also be includes C = Conversions--Taking data from an older system, or from spreadsheets, and converting it to new SAP system; may also be updating other programs to new best practices E = Enhancements--Take an existing program/function module/etc and make it have additional or better functionality F = Forms--may be a SmartForm (super easy) or SAPScripts (considerably more difficult) You should also keep in mind that there is ABAP, and ABAP Object-Oriented. Personally, I find the latter easier to deal with, but it's good to know both. There are a wealth of tutorials available for free around the web for doing anything you please in ABAP. You might find it difficult to learn if you don't have access to an ABAP system, though. I recommend getting miniSAP if you aren't already working for someone with a full SAP test client. [Here's a step-by-step tutorial.](http://abap-gallery.blogspot.com/2007/07/step-by-step-learning-abap.html) [Here's a resource for downloading miniSAP.](http://sapport.blogspot.com/2007/11/minisap-where-to-download-it.html)
Wonderful advise, thank you very much. That step-by-step is very useful for start. I bought [ABAP OBJECTS](http://www.amazon.com/ABAP-Objects-Introduction-Programming-Applications/dp/0201750805) and it has helped me a hell of a lot. I've noticed that learning to program is a lot like learning a language. Logic and structure plays a big part but they're nothing if you don't remember the words (or syntax).
Nice. Thanks!
Check out CL_ABAP_TABLEDESCR for a much easier way to do this.
Is that the POSNR for the record that you're working with? If so, something I found as a suggestion was "check out FM CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT". Basically, this converts the POSNR into a long, ugly-looking string which you can use to search for the record in certain tables. There is also a FM CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT which will convert the long, ugly string back into the nice POSNR you have now.
Thank you! :)
Not a problem! :)
More f6 less f5
Well shit...I just found this subreddit while looking for some tips on where to begin learning ABAP if I have zero programming experience.
Thanks for the reply. I have been on the team for a little over a week now and they are having me do some practice documents which pull stuff from a database and format it into a nice, sort-able table. This could be an interesting ride to a level that is above mediocrity. 
As someone who is about 1.5 years into ABAP programming, I'm curious as to how your experience is progressing. Have you had any formal trainings or have you only had internal trainings from your company?
Sorry, can't help you directly, but try download the first course of sap formation on ABAP (BC100) on sites like filetube or rapidshare for exemple : "BC100_EN_Col91_FV_Part_A4.pdf"
You'll want to take a look at the output determination procedure in your configuration. Within the procedure you see that there is a field called "Requirement" to the right hand side. You'll see 901 there. Select the field, hit F4 and you'll be able to select 901 and view the code to see why it's failing. 
I've got a couple of questions. 1. Is the field in question marked as obligatory? If so, you can make it optional instead and check for a value at START-OF-SELECTION instead. 2. How are you making the field grayed out? Are you looping at the screen and then setting one of the field's screen attributes? Which one? I think if you modify screen-active and set it to 0 it will automatically set screen-invisible to 1, and screen-output/input to 0. (Check [here](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_470/helpdata/en/9f/dbab6f35c111d1829f0000e829fbfe/content.htm))
Hi chikipici, thank you for the effort to answer. You definetly made some things clearer though i've found another job and my interest in SAP is not relevant anymore. But ive started to learn how to develop for the Intershop system and i can see similarities to how its like to be an SAP dev.
Great! Have an excellent career ahead.
Location? 
Compensation?
Very important questions might as well add schedule? in the mix
Compensation will depend on experience and other factors but either way it's very competitive. I can give you more details if you're interested and would like to move forward.
It's a full time position but we're very flexible. This is something that can be discussed if you're interested.
.
Hi mate, I have a similar profile like yours, and I'm having and interview next year. Could you hive me some advice? Godspeed.
If we are interested, where do we send you our resume or where can we contact you?
it's been my experience that at least BAPIs have relatively useful documentation straight in the sap system. But beyond that there's no debate that over the years it's best to keep detailed notes of every time you've used a new function module so you don't have to keep relearning the idiosyncrasies of every function module. Consider it just one more edge that experience buys you.
Yep quite normal indeed! As Haster mentioned, it's definitely advisable that once you have gone through all the trouble of figuring out the right FM and how it use it, keep it well documented for your own notes. Alternatively publish your findings on the SAP document forums which not only is there for your own use but can help others too. 
Yeah, +1 to all the responses on documentation. I find myself playing around in SE37 testing more than reading documentation
If the FM is marked as not released you will never find documentation on it. Those are not "supposed" to be used by customers. IMHO why not try finding a class that does the specific task... FM's are so 1990's
I don't know what most of that means (I never use BAPIs), but you did make me wonder why I've never done a dropdown on a selection screen.
Truly. I do feel like I don't know what being an ABAP developer is, before I try a project that actually tries using what SAP has already made. Soon^TM .
I just read about them on the [SCN](http://scn.sap.com/community/abap/blog/2013/12/06/abap-mesh-in-740-connect-your-internal-table-as-bo-node-association), and it looks like they would mainly be used as a shorthand for when you have normalized data in your internal tables. That's the best I can tell, anyway.
How does the mapping works ? Or have you done the mapping with another programm ?
I used tcode SQVI just to keep a copy of it. To figure it out, it was just trial and error, which is why I posted it. It's very annoying though. Everything works toward VIOROO if you're looking at the move planning part of RE/FX. EDIT: Or are you asking about the program RSPRTBEZ?
No, the program itself is pretty simple and helpful, thanks for that. I meant the data model you linked. Was it created in SAP or have you used a 3rd party program ?
Created in SAP, using tcode SQVI. SQVI is a nice transaction to make quick table joins and selection reports. They're user specific though, so if you want to use them as a report that multiple users can access you have to port it to tcode [SQ01](http://scn.sap.com/thread/1498910).
Thanks so much for this advice ! Found out how to use it properly and how to create data models. I always used MS Access to create data models but this is so much faster. Thanks a lot !
But a commit work at the end of a BAPI is fine though right? :)
Unfortunately this won't be possible. What exactly is your requirement? You can of course create your own popup window with an html control inside it. Of course that's a little more complicated than just calling a function module.
thanks, I imagined it anyway use the module.
Well, that depends, the issue here is that you must be sure that a COMMIT/ROLLBACK is not in a middle of a process because that would reset the LUW. Imagine that this happens and you commit data, what will happen if after that an error occurs? The data is already commited and you'll have inconsistencies. I don't advice that practice if you don't know exactly what is happening. Read the documentation of the BAdI and debug if necessary. Hope it helps. Best regards.
It's a Real Estate BAPI so zero documentation. I enhanced it at the end of the BAPI. So it's fundamentally the same is putting the commit work after the BAPI call. It's being used as an RFC but I suppose the alternative would be to call the BAPI commit function module remotely as well. Regardless, I understand the bapi pretty well by now; it converts the itabs to an object and calls a class method to process the data. The method call returns a message object as well, which I'm checking to make sure the processing was successful before I commit. 
Good job bro thanks Will try
Glad to help. Best regards.
It's BAPI_RE_MP_CREATE. Not custom.
I haven't however, why would you create a layer above? or why would I create another ALV creator? What would be the motivation? ABAP is a language for SAP, it looks for productivity in SAP and the whole purpose is to achieve things according to its best practices. In my opinion, in the realm of SAP, it's better to rely on the tools it provides. There may be parts we could make in order to improve things however it is better to focus in the problem and/or requirements you target and be as efficient as you can be. On the other hand we must admit that sometimes there are bugs and sometimes many things are not efficient but the language is aimed to speed up development in this environment. Best regards.
Great post!
Welcome and thanks for your contribution. It's a very quiet subreddit at the moment unfortunately. I'm still hoping it will become a little busier over time but for now I appreciate any contributions and information so that the user base here can improve their skill set together.
Yes, few people nowadays use headerlines, however there's a lot of legacy code which has this coding. I don't advise it either, I personally use work areas and field symbols as you do.
Fair enough, lagacy code still utilize them, that is correct of course. Just wasn't completely sure ;-) thanks for the clarification. 
Thanks for your comments anyway. I updated the post explaining that this practice is not advisable and because of legacy code you could find this practice. Best regards
Customer Systems are to old :( Thx for the input i didn't know about the new features.
You can always create a Z* Functino Module (Making it RFC enabled) and make that FM call the other FM that you need and are not RFC enabled.
Wouldn't that mean I have to import the Z-FM to every system I want to maintain with my program?
The easiest solution is to just implement the event handlers in your lcl_alv class instead of creating a separate lcl_f4 class.
I can recommend the SAP Press books. They're usually very high quality and contain a lot of useful information. Their high price unfortunately makes them difficult to purchase as an individual. I requested that my company finance the purchase and they were more than happy to oblige. Your best source for information is probably SCN if you're not going to purchase the book. There's a ton of documentation and blog posts that are full of useful knowledge to expand on your ability. In fact, most of the SAP Press books are written by authors that post on SCN quite often and the content is normally pulled from posts that they have made. The author of the book you mentioned above for example; [Hermann Gahm](https://scn.sap.com/people/hermann.gahm/content), has numerous posts on ST12 to get you started. The list of chapters are also available online and you could easily search through SCN to research the topics. You might find it a bit tedious to search SCN for content, especially if you're not sure what you're searching for, but everything is there for you to read for free. So use the resource.
Appreciate it! I work in manufacturing and we have a tonne of reports which look for system/user statuses which seems to be the longest cause of wait time in reports. I was looking into doing the same and creating a set of custom static methods, first of all to gather those pesky status just by passing in a table and some field names (instead of per-line selects!).
Glad you sorted it out. :)
I've never bothered getting that deep into Adobe Interactive forms. They're just annoying. Why don't you process the data before you send it to the form instead of using the objects in the formulas?
hahaha nice! I have tried several iterations but can't get it right. Any pointers?
Okay. I'm new to ABAP obviously...So i would need 4 "DO x Times" statements? Do i use an IF statement with SY-INDEX?
Gotcha. Its interesting that it takes 4 "FOR" loops in Java to do what i'm trying to do. argh
Here you go: DATA: i TYPE i, idx TYPE i. DO 10 TIMES. IF sy-index MOD 2 = 0. CONTINUE. ELSE. idx = sy-index. ENDIF. DO idx TIMES. IF sy-index &gt; ( idx / 2 ). i = i - 1. ELSE. i = i + 1. ENDIF. WRITE: i. ENDDO. CLEAR i. WRITE:/. ENDDO.
Not at work now, but look at the POSITION keyword.
Will sort it tomorrow for you
Nice little bit of fun figuring this out. :-) We should do more of these. DATA: n TYPE i, "Number of rows. i TYPE i, "Value o TYPE i, "Value ct TYPE TABLE OF string WITH HEADER LINE, c(100). "To Print DO 10 TIMES. n = sy-index. DO n + ( n - 1 ) TIMES. IF i &lt; n. ADD 1 TO i. o = i. ct = |{ ct } { i }|. "Older version would be CONCATENATE ct ' ' i INTO ct. ELSE. SUBTRACT 1 FROM o. ct = |{ ct } { o }|. "Older version would be CONCATENATE ct ' ' o INTO ct. ENDIF. ENDDO. APPEND ct. CLEAR ct. CLEAR i. ENDDO. LOOP AT ct. WRITE ct TO c CENTERED. WRITE c. WRITE /. ENDLOOP. 
This will dynamically move depending on the window size. REPORT PYRAMID NO STANDARD PAGE HEADING. DATA: i TYPE i, idx TYPE i, window_width TYPE i, posi TYPE i, diff_count TYPE i, val TYPE string. PERFORM get_screen_param CHANGING window_width. DO 10 TIMES. IF sy-index MOD 2 = 0. CONTINUE. ELSE. idx = sy-index. diff_count = diff_count + 1. ENDIF. DO idx TIMES. IF sy-index &gt; ( idx / 2 ). i = i - 1. ELSE. i = i + 1. ENDIF. val = |{ i }|. posi = ( window_width / 2 ) + ( sy-index - ( idx - 1 ) ) + diff_count. POSITION posi. WRITE: val. ENDDO. CLEAR val. CLEAR i. WRITE:/. ENDDO. FORM get_screen_param CHANGING window_width TYPE i. DATA: begrow TYPE i, begcol TYPE i, endrow TYPE i, endcol TYPE i. CALL 'GET_WINDOW_DATA' ID 'BEGROW' FIELD begrow ID 'BEGCOL' FIELD begcol ID 'ENDROW' FIELD endrow ID 'ENDCOL' FIELD endcol. window_width = endcol - begcol + 1. ENDFORM.
Oh I know, just interesting to see someone use the new | | operators and obsolete ADD 1 !
A result of working on so many different versions. :)
Yes thanks, I've done it that way. I just wanted to know if it is possible to work with objects.
I too prefer to put them in the print program. I've used IAF and hated every bit of it. The development environment is not user friendly. Maybe it has gotten better but the early days were tough. You had three things to install and God forbid you do it in the wrong order. Have full Adobe? Good luck. I had to uninstall all before I could get them to work together. Adding Adobe into the mix changed the required order of instal. I'd mess with AIF more if I knew javascript. I'm too lazy to learn it as we don't have a java stack let alone AIF licenses. It is fun testing web services without a java stack.
Did you come up with this list? The author is very wrong especially when you say somebody does or doesn't have the ability to do things. An example is that in the project manager section. It says "They do not have to have technical SAP knowledge" which is a very broad generalization. The best one is below. "Developers lack the business acumen and are more geeky, [oops – I meant ‘technically minded’ :-)] which is why they do not interact directly with the Users, depending instead on FAs to translate Users’ requirements into more technical terms." A developer should ALWAYS have interaction with the users unless it is off shored position.
thanks I thought I would end up with syntax error.
It's hard to know what's missing without seeing your code.
I second that.
This post is misleading. SAPUI5 and Gateway are not the same thing. 
char = int works only, if the char var is something digital like. E.g. "7"... "120"... "129.23" ... "11.23.523" (so only numbers and ".") Due to fact that int is with zero decimals "11.10" will be an eleven (11). If you put anything inside the char which makes it not interpretable as a number, there will be a hard dump which exactly says this. E.g. "11,10"... "11&amp;10" ... of course in cool programming this should never be done, except you are totally sure ;)
Extremely outdated.
Yes the breakpoint it on the client 293. I really do not what to do.
Only other thing that I can think of is if the process gets executed in a background task. Those are a little bit more difficult to debug as the process is normally kicked off with a generic system user like "BATCHUSER". If you can find the process (Either by doing a trace through ST12 or by looking through the processes currently running on SM37) once it has completed, you can kick off the background job in debug mode using JDBG. Otherwise your method is not being executed.
Yes, I do redefine the **CUSTOMERMASTERSE_GET_ENTITYSET**. I really do not know what to do. 
- Can you post the query you're trying to execute? - Do you get any results from the query you're executing? - Are you executing this query with your own SAP user or a different user?
Hi there. With the classic method of developing, namely SE80, there's no such way, because you have to be logged into the system all the time. But fora few years now, you can log in to your system using eclipse. There is an environment from SAP to use it that way. With this you can log in and work offline, say, when the connection is cut off due to a weak signal. That doesn't mean, you could download a whole package. The only way to do that is to download, if I remember correct, two files from the server, if you have access to the file system. I've never seen an ABAP developer, who was allowed to do so. So the answer is basically: No.
Thank you for the reply this helped a lot :)
is this a SAP released, SAP certified product?
For trials and downloads. http://www.sap.com/developer/trials-downloads.html SAP has their own publisher. https://www.sap-press.com/?gclid=CKDNno6Li9ICFUlNfgodW_oIgw The biggest hurdle most people have with ABAP development itself isn't the technical syntax of the language. It's understanding the business flow and how all of SAP's standard tables/data definitions/transactions work. If you are going to school and want to learn SAP, I'd recommend getting a business minor/major to supplement it. It is after all, an ERP solution at its core. Being able to understand business areas such as Finance/Controlling, Warranty, Supply Chain, Warehouse Management, etc... are incredibly important to your success. Source: I have been an ABAP Developer and Basis Admin for 5 years now. 
How do I prepare myself if i interested in it? I mean, even as junior (entry) position, I dont want to be completely zero knowledge/experience in it. I think i should know some lingo/syntax in using it.
&gt; ABAP certifications are intentionally set up in a way to limit the amount of developers in the market understood. Too many sometimes because its too easy and dilute everything else. I will try looking some companies looking for trainee. I can easily found the cert program near my place, its too expensive, not worth it if I can't get any job. Appreciate your explanation.Thank you.
Try this: ABAP Academy offers its free training to gain ABAP skills for befinners here: http://abapacademy.com/join-free-abap-learning-challenge/ You can even get your own SAP system for development: http://abapacademy.com/howtoinstallsaptrial/
Yes. It is released by SAP itself. 
Just as a belated PS. You're going to have to ask a specific question if you're looking for an answer. One could write books about general advice and tips. You sound like you're well on your way so my advice would be, just wing it, and see where that gets you. All of the modules that you listed above (excl. PMP) are used extensively by clients so if you can, do them all.
All of the information contained within this PDF is available on the exam site with a couple of generic Q&amp;A answers that are just common sense. IE. "Here's the list of topics covered, here are the exam rules, this exam is tough so buy these books." This doesn't qualify as a "study guide".
DB Cursors. Though I'm not sure you really mean between two databases.
If you use LDBs (Logical Databases) you can process pretty much limitless data in batch mode. Read the data from the table (LDB) using the GET command. Write the data with OpenSQL to the other table using direct Modify/Insert or Update Modules in update task (if you prefer). Maybe the GET technique is not strictly using Open SQL? It will do what you need to do though.
You can easily export it to excel sheet. Use https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ABAP/abap2xlsx?original_fqdn=wiki.sdn.sap.com or look for standard functions. 
Depending on what you're requirement is, you can also easily add a button in Powerpoint and just write some VB script to call an RFC. [Start here.](http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?337408-VB-and-SAP-Integration)
Likely not pptx but Excel sure. Create the file on the application server, populate it with abap2xlsx and then GUI download. 
Once you've experimented please let us know. I don't personally have access to a 7.40 system anymore.

Do you have an access to a client testing server? Check PA0001 table. It can be huuuuge. ~EDIT: Of course I know that a client testing server is not a good idea, but... you know. :P If u have an access. :D
I would use Simple Transformations 
Standard ABAP sorting is only ascending or descending. You could add an extra field in your table that converts the message type to a number e.g. S = 1, E = 2 etc. Then sort on that field. 
Strg+D in Eclipse is Delete line, not dublicate
Thanks, I thought this would've been the case. I ended up making the following, it adds a little bit of overhead, but 'should' work with any table. I have only tested with the BAPIRET2 table so far (it needs to be installed with SAPLINK): https://github.com/GoThePower/GoThePower-ABAP-CustomSort So far it only works with one custom sort, it will work with any amount of standard sorts. 
Thank for review :) i just edited cheat sheet
You know that if you press Ctrl+Shift+L, it opens a list of shortcuts. IE. You already have a "cheat sheet" in Eclipse.
Yeah, this shortcut is also added in the cheat sheet. But much easier to me is to see the list of most used shortcuts on the paper.
What is the problem?
I get an error message in the select statement saying: "A-vbeln is unknown." So I replace A with vbak. "vbak-vbeln is unknown". I don't know how to resolve the issue.
You do realize you're joining table A with itself right?
 That was a mistype on my part. It should be A-vbeln = B-vbeln
But yeah, long story short... I'm not too sure what I need to do to join 2 tables together.
Right, I had access to a server today and I'm a bit rusty so bare with me :) An inner join has the following syntax: SELECT result FROM data source [AS tabalias] INNER JOIN data source [ AS tabalias] ON join condition .... A join condition is specified as **data source~field**, you're using - instead of ~. You're going to get another error after you fix this, see if you can solve it youself. Also, might be just me, but I find using table aliases really confusing for bigger joins, so I don't use them at all, you can simply go with vbak~vbeln instead of a~vbeln
I won't know until tomorrow. I don't have a server of my own. But i'll keep you posted. I truth, I'll probably have 100 other questions. I've taken an introductory course on Udemy, but I don't feel its enough. Are there any courses you recommend?
No problem, just try to figure the problems yourself and then ask, you're going to learn a lot doing this. About learning material, I used a lot of sap help to learn and mostly sites in portuguese(my primary language), but I've learned a lot through zevolving and abapinho(he translates most of his posts). 
I ended up figuring it out. Annoyed I came into work late, but I figured it out. It was that the vbeln column was undefined. So I ended up writing this: SELECT * INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE it_data FROM vbak "AS A INNER JOIN vbkd "AS B ON vbak~vbeln = vbkd~vbeln WHERE erdat IN s_erdat. I changed 'SELECT vbeln, etc.' into a wildcard mask. That way it selected every table in the vbkd database. I'm not sure how efficient it is, but it works. I also commented out the"AS A and the "AS B statements. Took your advice and decided not to use an alias name. One last question for you: whether it's an inner join or an outer join I still have to use this character: ~ Not a hyphen, "-" ?
&gt; I changed 'SELECT vbeln, etc.' into a wildcard mask. That way it selected every table in the vbkd database The wildcard works, but you're transfering way more data than you need from the database, it's not a good practice but, imho, too much nitpicking around performance problems that may not be there is bad, if it's slow when you test it, you solve it(unless you have a lot of time in your hands, then do it right :P ) Also, try to make it work without the wildcard, it's possible and it will give you a syntax error that I was talking about in my last reply. &gt; One last question for you: whether it's an inner join or an outer join I still have to use this character: ~ Not a hyphen, "-" ? Yes, you'll always use the column selector.
So that's what it's called. Good to know. Also when I have time, I'll look into removing the Wildcard for something else. I still have more of the program to write. - One of which is a HOTSPOT ON/OFF that leads to another page (essentially using it as a hyperlink). But that's neither here nor there.
~~Alright. I have one other question if you see this. I'm trying to write a program that uses a hotspot to take a user to a separate field after clicking on the PO Number. Essentially when the user enters a date, they'll see this:~~ ~~Sales Order # ----- Customer Order # ----- Sales Order Date ----- PO~~ ~~abc124 ----- bb1234 ----- 1/1/2011 ----- POAABBCC~~ --------------------------------------------- ~~The catch being that when the user clicks on the PO number, it will take them to a separate screen. One that shows something similar to the following:~~ ----------------------------------- ~~Repair Parts Order: x~~ ~~Sold-To Party: x~~ ~~Ship-To Party: x~~ ~~PO Number: x~~ ~~PO Date: x~~ ---------------------------------- ~~And a host of other fields. The problem is, even when looking at the code a coworker provided me. Nothing seems to indicate 'where' or 'how' you move from one area to the other. Just the FORMAT HOTSPOT ON flag, write x, FORMAT HOTSPOT OFF.~~ ~~That's basically it. The code I've written looks something similar to this:~~ START-OF-SELECTION. WRITE 'Click me!' COLOR 5. LOOP AT it_data. FORMAT HOTSPOT ON. WRITE :/2 it_data-vbeln, 22 it_data-kunnr, 35 it_data-erdat, 55 it_data-bstkd. FORMAT HOTSPOT OFF. ENDLOOP. AT LINE-SELECTION. WRITE 'Yeah!' COLOR 3. ~~So I understand the basic's of how a Hotspot works. I just don't understand how it would take me to an entirely separate screen/work area.~~ ~~Remind me to buy you gold thursday, pst.~~ Edit: I figured it out. It's really weird how it works.
Hey mate. By any chance, how would I do this with 3 tables? I'm floundering a bit.
Glad you worked it out, just watch out for header line statements DATA: something type vbak with header line. or DATA: something type vbak occurs 0. Header lines are useful for short test programs, but in production code it can get confusing really fast! An example using your declaration would be: IF it_data IS INITIAL. "do something ENDIF. The code inside the IF would be executed if the HEADER is empty, it doesn't check anything inside the internal table. I've seen way too many errors due to this declaration
You just have to repeat the syntax: FROM data source [AS tabalias] INNER JOIN data source 1 [ AS tabalias] ON join condition .... INNER JOIN data source 2 [ AS tabalias] ON join condition .... and so on!
AFAIK, the described method it's the only one there is. Roll back manually. If there are no versions or u can't remember / you forget something, bad luck. That's the SE80 that is. Don't know for eclipse or any third party tools. 
and if you forget something to roll back, it will be transported the next time somebody touches that object. 
Thanks, that's some weird "version managing", but well, so it is.
Thank you too
it should be FORMAT, not FUNCTION.
At our customer we have several solutions for this. (1) Al office documents are zip files with XML's in it. Unzip with abap and modify the XML. Either transform with xslt or simply replace fields created from the power point developer tab (most stable as they cannot be formatted somewhere randomly). The latter we have even done in Fiori using only JavaScript! (2) create a web service to something that can more easily do it, like any Java or .Net framework. We use Aspose (license required), which we found to be the best with many other features. (3) sap CRM has standard word and Adobe document templates. This could be an alternative. (4) Smartforums (5) Adobe Livecycle (downloadable from sap and configurable in the GUI 
Outdated and registration required to view the document.
I've resolved my issue using example from this site: http://www.erpworkbench.com/sap-dictionary/shelp/shelp_exit_populate.htm
Already done 
There is nothing here that you can't find on SAP's site. 
Ok! Fixed the problem. 1 out of my 5 Table/Views were set to "Display/Maintenance Allowed" while the other 4 were set to "Display/Maintenance Allowed with Restriction". Set that 1 to the same as the others, and it started working as intended. 
What are your trying to do?
The idea it's to call the transaction CJ20N, from a case in a case record, but with a field of the case as a parameter. So it's not possible to use transaction with parameters, instead I try to call a report where I make the assignation of the field to a variable and pass the variable to the function module with the same behaviour like CJ20N.
I don't remember any that does what you need but I believe you'll have a better chance of finding your answer on https://answers.sap.com
I am just an IS-U guy, but take a look at this link, maybe that helps https://archive.sap.com/discussions/thread/1493630
Pretty hard (for me at least) to diagnose an idoc text file by itself. The application log should tell you which segment is causing the problem though. Have you looked there, or is it only spitting out "syntax error" with no further insight? 
You can add a new entry to BD50. But yes, if it were me I'd use a exit.
You can delete rows from a table using DELETE FROM ... that is assuming you know the criteria for deleting the rows. You would also likely need to use MODIFY to update the remaining row to reflect the required data in that row. 
Do you want to merge them or replace duplicates?
Thanks for the guidance
As long as you have SAP Java Gui installed you should be able to call these in JScript. I've never written anything but bash scripts in linux so I'm not an authority on the subject. But I would assume that installing SAP Gui would make all of the necessary libs available.
[openSap](https://open.sap.com/)
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/ They have great tutorials, mainly for sapui5, which is basically the same as fiori from a development point of view. If you are not interested in developing, then you can skip sapui5
Horst Keller has really goods exercises for beginners too. Search for them. 
one possible way: create the two substrings, one left of the gap, one right of the gap, then concatenate those two. one way to get a substring is like this: lv_string = '1234567'. lv_left = lv_string+0(3). " &lt;- 0 is the offset, i.e. how many characters should be skipped beginning from the start. 3 is the length of the substring. lv_left should contain '123' lv_right = lv_string+5(2). " &lt;- same principle, lv_right should be '67' now. one way to put those two strings together would be: CONCATENATE lv_left lv_right INTO lv_string_cut. " lv_string_cut should be '12367' now. there are lots of different ways to do this, for example the built-in substring function (https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/index.htm?file=abensubstring_functions.htm) or string expressions (https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcompute_string.htm)
Thank you
The most common way I have seen is to use the assert statement. For example: Assert 1 = 2. Should always cause a short dump. IMO it’s not really best practice to force a short dump rather than gracefully dealing with errors, but I don’t know what your business case is here. 
Thanks. I’m currently learning and need to test if a catch runs as expected
Division by zero is also a classic one. But you can also use 'raise exception type...' to test your try-catch statement
Thanks
Raising message type “X” is also an easy one.
Two variables are not needed. lv\_string = '1234567'. lv\_string = lv\_string+0(3) &amp;&amp; lv\_string+5(2). 
Awesome thanks mate. You may find this course interesting as well. https://open.sap.com/courses/wtc1 
Thanks for the link. That's funny - I'm just completing week 2 of that exact same course - those presenters are a riot! I assume they go into test seams at some point!! 
No worries happy to be of zero help :) I did it not long ago but can't remember if it was in the curriculum 
Actually it’s helpful just knowing that I am not the only person in the universe interested in ABAP unit test. My developers look at me like a crazy man when I talk to them about it. 
Yep my dev teams as well. Its better for us as well as we can cut our ties to the functional consultants somewhat and complete a relevant unit test without the creation of transactional data. Minimising development time. 
Bingo. That is a key aspect for me, and I've found that the improvement in dev time began very quickly - AUT learning curve is not steep at all. Amazingly my feature team (analysts, product owners etc) are onboard too: I promised them vastly improved code quality, faster, (after a small initial investment in informal training) - so what could they say?!? So now comes the tricky part. The Dev team are slowly adopting the habit, and I'm searching for key performance indications to track the effectiveness of the AUT journey. My team are the guinea pigs for AUT and Code Coverage, and if it improves our code quality then we'll roll it out to the larger org. Currently I'm tracking - * Number of objects being tested * Code coverage % per object * Time taken to develop (transport create date -&gt; release date) * Number of changes due to SIT/UAT/Prod bugs (# of transports) Do you have any experience of this aspect? What metrics to use to measure the benefits of AUT? Maybe the training mentions it later in the course?
Wow that's probably a good path to go down. I've never really tracked AUT individually. I've always enveloped the time into the complete development cycle. Obviously my devs document evidence it has been completed. The biggest benefit I can see is more accurate estimates for program schedules. 
My company are big on telemetry. They like to see performance data on everything. I say the code is better, the managers want to see a graph!! So if I can get the raw data somehow, Application Insights or Power BI will do the pretty pictures!!
Another way to short dump is to access an unassigned field symbol.
Hi Abaper! Everyone will recommend [open.sap.com](https://open.sap.com), they have a lot of courses and imho are good as far I know. OpenUI5 [https://open.sap.com/courses/ui51](https://open.sap.com/courses/ui51) could be a good start due to your profile, you'll see html+javascript and the webIDE with their own git. Also you can try webdynpro Java but I don't think that will have too much future because html is more common now. I did a search in opensap in order to provide you a link and looks like no ABAP course are available, only one regarding ABAP in HANA and seems to be a recommendation guide to improve the current code to the new version: [https://open.sap.com/courses/a4h1](https://open.sap.com/courses/a4h1) and no every client run the latest version... maybe someone knows something better. &amp;#x200B; Regards and good luck
There are a couple of ABAP courses on Udemy I don’t know how good they are. 
I highly recommend reading ABAB Objects, it'll give You a sense of distinction between domenes, data elements, structures etc. Also beside the theory it's got lots of code, examples and will show You how to make actuall useable reports/programs/classes. One of the always hot subjects is workflows, I don't know any books on that but when You'll get more into coding in ABAP look in SAPTechnical and other sites for object oriented worklow tutorials, SAP WF is pretty easy to get into but not that easy to master so it's rewarding to know Your stuff in this area. If You'd like to get into SAP Fiori, as metioned here in comments OpenUI5 + WebIDE is a good start, but also try to google how to build an oData service in SAP gateway since it's better if You know how the whole process looks like from the database to the end user. Good luck ;)
Thank you all for taking the time to answer me. It really means much to me. I will analyze all suggestions and make a decision. Once again, thank you so much!! 
This is valuable advice. (others in the thread are also, but this one resonates with me). ABAP is the proprietary language for SAP, obviously, and is used in the industry largely for customizing and extending SAP functionality. It is a rare situation where you would be required to build a standalone application. Most ABAP work falls into the categories described as RICEF (reports, interfaces, conversions, enhancements, forms) and demands a strong familiarity with: 1. the ways in which the standard SAP system is constructed and functions, 2. the various customizing techniques, and strong integration of data and functions within the standard modules. So you should focus on the functional area you are familiar with (you mentioned procurement) and get to know all the integration points, the databases and views, the APIs, BADIs, enhancements, SMODs etc. This way you can use your ABAP skills productively - and maintain the system's stability. 
SOLVED IT: For this specific requirement you need to inform the control field VALUTYP. Use value '5' when the posting is for paledger B0 and '6' for paledger 10.
Swdd?
In my opinion are workflows are a pain im the ass. But there are some advantages to use them!
I live in NJ and make $120,000. I've been an ABAP programmer for 20 years.
As useful as it is to have an estimation of expected salary, you're going to get a widely different values from different parts of world and regardless of whether or not you're anonymous or not, it's taboo to put a numeric value against your name. &amp;#x200B; The things that you really need to know about ABAP work is as follows; 1. You can comfortably support a family of 3 on your salary in a 3 bedroom house after 10+ years of work. 2. When you make the decision to shift to contract work, as most of us do for financial reasons, you're not likely to struggle to find contracts. A friend of mine has been doing contract work for 15 years and in that time he sat without work for 2 weeks. I've personally been contracting for 2 years and I just had my contract renewed for a 3rd. 3. ABAP has a relatively high salary cap compared to most other careers but that goes for almost everything SAP related. You're more likely to stick close to that cap (which shifts based on experience) once you've built up your contracting buffer and you're willing to shop around. As with most careers you need to have a backbone and as much information as you can dig up when negotiating your rate. 4. Understand that when negotiating people will tell you things like "you're going to price yourself out of the market" to try and drive your price down. Any company wants to save as much cost as they can on their staff. 5. Companies are not your friends and you have no obligation to stick around. Don't be loyal to your company because they're definitely not loyal to you. They're cut-throat. If they can find someone that can provide the same quality of work that you provide they will drop you. So find a niche and skill yourself up in that niche. Build up a reputation so that the people in the industry know to come to you for that specific skill. This takes time and effort. Last bit of advice; When building up experience, stick with one company for a minimum of two years. If you're seen to shift careers at the drop of a hat you'll be considered fickle and unreliable and you definitely don't want that. Don't chase money but also don't settle. &amp;#x200B; Your career is not a get-rich-quick scheme and you're not going to drive a ferrari in a couple of years. ABAP is however a good career choice and definitely something you can dedicate your life to.
1950 USD netto a month in Czechia. 20 years of development experiences.
In your experience, what has been the salary cap for you?
$820 here in Poland with one year experience, and it's considered much. It's twice min salary. It looks pretty bad comparing to other countries.
420 USD per month, with one year of experience but with a CV of 4 years :'(
How much do you work in a month?
Officially I work 40 hours but I use to work even after work because I can't finish my duty in time.
Are the keyfields in your itab unique? 
Sadly, no. 
Key fields are empty
MODIFY command of using contents of key fields to modify or add lines to do tab. To SAP you are modifying the same line again and again.
Thanks for the explanation. Any tips what I could use to make this work?
I’ve added unique keys in one of the key fields and now it works perfectly. Thank you, kind sir
You can use insert with "accepting duplicates" as key word
Thank you for reply, I am a SAP ABAP developer with one year experience but I always want to improve more and gain experience. I am changing a report for S/4HANA and while optimizing it I thought it will be better to eleminate the LOOP for gt_materials and find a way to put it into the query see below: SELECT mara~matnr marc~werks... FROM mara JOIN marc ON mara~matnr = marc~matnr INTO TABLE gt_materials WHERE ... LOOP AT gt materials INTO gs_materials. COLLECT gs_materials INTO gs_list. ENDLOOP. LOOP AT gt_list INTO GS_LIST. ... ... ...(proceeding the logic) I was asking if there was a statement that would allow to collect inside the query. We have APPENDING TABLE statement and we need also a "COLLECTING TABLE" statement in some cases. What would you recommend? 
Couldn't you try something like this: select field1 field2 field3 from table into workarea where x eq y. collect workarea into collect\_table. endselect. It should work, I think.
Yes of course i did like that but i thought if it was a way to collect directly into the query to not loop again.
Cover yourself in honey and jump into a wasp's nest. If you are lucky, you'll die and never have to become an ABAP developer. If you're not, at least you'll have a taste of the pain.
Another crazy idea: select sum() ?
Wish they tweak ABAP into a more modern language when they roll out ABAP in SCP
You are right. even though it gets more and more modern ( more or less ) with every new release. 
Agreed 👍
my company pays really bad ( compared to others ) - but i am currently making 35k per year ( in germany ) 
I live in Russian, Kazan. Work official 40h/week. Work with ABAP and SAP about 5 month. My company pays me 580$
Maybe this is a issue with GUI version or something ? 
Most likely reason that comes to my mind would be, that the statement you press F5 on the first time (where it „locks“) just does take a Lot of Time to execute. This might not be very common for Single Lines of code, but could for example be the case for inefficient database queries/table reads/or maybe even RFC function calls to external systems, that do not let you debug step by step an rather complete the whole function before giving control back to your debugging session
Agreed. Try writing a small program that you can step through to verify what is happening. 
In this situation, do F6/F7 still work? If you just wait, say, 5 minutes, does it "unlock"? Is it always on the same line /same type of line (like on a COMMIT WORK AND WAIT)? It may be an event being called that you are not aware of and that takes time to complete
Nothing works, I cant scroll in the debugger but nothing actually responds for something like 5 seconds, and then it "unlocks" and everything is fine. its not happening in the same line or even same program. &amp;#x200B; thank you
Thanks for the reply will try all of those.
Can you post a few lines where the lagging occures? On what release are you working on? Whats your GUI version?
You need a specific sap module containing this table. I don’t think is this possible to get it for free

Thanks. Working on it. 
 You could save your sap data as csv to the application server and do your exel calculation on basis on the csv. Afterwards you could upload the csv into your ABAP report to do final stuff and save it to the DB. If you need more information about the save as csv and upload part feel free to ask. Maybe there is an automated way doing it if your sap system is running on windows, I know there is a way to trigger system commands out of sap but you definitely need basis and system privileges for this....
Can this be done in an automated fashion so the end user is unaware? It needs to be seamlessly accomplished behind the scenes?
Not the CSV-Down/-Upload. But maybe this will help you: [https://blogs.sap.com/2016/08/21/how-to-use-vba-recorded-code-in-abap/](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/08/21/how-to-use-vba-recorded-code-in-abap/)
When you say ABAP script - do you mean ABAP? Or are you writing a front end script? Because honestly the string manipulation you’re talking about shouldn’t be that hard in pure ABAP. 
I am working in VC dependencies which I believe are coded in a lite version of ABAP. Syntax is [here](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_46c/helpdata/en/92/58c4de417011d189ec0000e81ddfac/content.htm?no_cache=true).

If you set up the abap instance and got everything up and running there is no need to learn abap. start your carrer as SAP Base Specialist instantly... but he is right, there are few ways to learn abap without your own nw sever. Check the openSAP courses!
Thanks I will look at them, I have to admit the SAP specializations aren't quite clear to me, again to use my college experience as a a comparison: I get what HTML and CSS do, they're the visual part. MySQL is the data with tables and etc what I use in my current job in Excel is kind of the same concept but much less complex. PHP and Java sort of bind these two part together and are what most people think of as "programming". But I'm trying to identify analogues within SAP and failing to do it.
Create a standard text (ST), then save all the text. Assign an ID, and save in the dbtable. Use the functions module create_text, save_text, read_text to play with the ST.

Thanks. Sure, I'll wait.
If you have not yet found a solution, one approach is to save text into SAP text table and store the text-id (key) into your dbtable. You can then use the standard FM Read_Text to retrieve it as needed. 
Why don't you use RAW or RAWSTRING types? Rawstring will set unreadable and then use programs for converting the data. This way you are "applying " GDPR.
Do this, never create a table unless you really need to.
That would be a lot harder than you might think. If you can, you should create an abap function in vc dependency, put your Excell values and formulas in a new SAP table, use function to read table and calculate desired values.
Try to create a SOAP call - add the parameter and receive the solution, its not the light-weighted solution, but it will definiately work
You could be in a loop - check whether the sy-tabix increases, or any other parameter changing (if you are too deep in the solution and put the breakpoint maybe that part called several times).
Why not adding to/using DMS? That framework could give you some help.

To install the machine you need 8GB ram and a Linux 64bits system.
Or just vm with Linux 
AFAIK, HANA is using a much more, "leaned to standards" approach to programming. In a workshop in Walldorf once was said, that most of the core team of the developers who are working on the engine have never worked with ABAP when starting with the project. The reasons are multiple, for example it is much easier to find a freshman who knows standard programming languages then one who knows something about ABAP. Also, the development for the connection between the application (S4) server and the database (HANA) is easier when the syntax is similar. I don't think ABAP will become completely obsolete any time soon, as there are just so many customer solutions in productive use, where it will be cheaper to maintain them for a long time rather than to to adopt them to a new concept and technology. I'm not affiliated with SAP in any way.
Well, you're right, we don't find freshmen who know ABAP, which is why my job now would be to find some and teach them and help them get staffed on projects. But I was wondering whether it would be a wiser career choice to already move to something else, and focus more on pure HANA, and not ABAP for HANA. I wouldn't give up ABAP, I kind of like it, especially since the syntax that was introduced in recent years is making it look like a more "modern" programming language, too.
Never give up on abap. As many other old languages it will stay alive for a long time. But yes, you need to learn new stuff. Id join the project.
I'd join the project as you already know ABAP, you can only learn new stuff. Even FIORI apps are using a mix of HTML5/JS and ABAP
In my humble opinion, the ABAP language will not disappear any time soon. Why is Hana written in other languages? Perhaps, because there exist more people in other languages them in ABAP, and releasing new things to the market is money. You can see this article talking about why moving towards new software can be very expensive. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.consultancy.uk/news/18243/lidl-cancels-sap-introduction-having-sunk-500-million-into-it](https://www.consultancy.uk/news/18243/lidl-cancels-sap-introduction-having-sunk-500-million-into-it) &amp;#x200B; ABAP language has new updates as the release as 7.5 with new functions and properties to survive these emergents (hype) languages that promise everything .

ABAP is like MySQL, but on steroids. I'm still relatively new to ABAP myself (only a few months into it). I'm coming over from a C# and JavaScript background myself and I think of it like a combination of traditional programming languages and SQL. But in ABAP everything is centered around tables. The traditional data table (large tables of data stored in servers) most people are familiar with are called "transparent tables" in SAP. They are only accessed initially when a query is done and typically a copy is made in the RAM of your system that you will then interact with (Work Areas). The table in your RAM is called an "internal table." And this is what you typically work with unless you wish to change the original data in the server. There are other data structures too, but those aren't used as often. And it's best to think of a table as a nested array, as you can iterate through it, but it will only see 1 row at a time. Also, unlike arrays, internal tables start at index = 1. Which brings me to other idiosyncrasies of ABAP. Like there is no === evaluator like in JS, and there is no == either. Its =, and it depends on how you use it. "For" loops aren't a thing, but instead you have while and do loops. And that's just to start. Don't even get me started on Regioning sections of code and visual viewers like Dynpro and ALV. As for what I see you being able to jump into "right away" within SAP, I'd probably say a Functional Analyst. I only know what the FA's near me are working on, and I see them working with Googlesheets a lot and don't really need to know how to code so much as what it's capable of and what it's not. Just need to know how the SAP system works and how to get the info that they want. The big caveat here is that SAP has many different sides and applications to it. You could be in WM, EWM, Fiori, BI/BW, etc. What works in 1 doesn't necessarily work in the others, but it will give you a headstart on what you need.
Thank you I very much appreciate this type of insight.

Why not? You can always go back to abap if you dont like it. I was in your spot a few years back. Then got into FICO, got a few projects on that area and now i have 2 skills to market. Even better, a few months back i got a project where they wanted both of my skills at the same time and im being payed like 30% above average for it
Concerning the „ABAP is dying“ part: there is currently an ABAP environment for the cloud in development. So, I don‘t think it is dying anytime soon. https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/05/sap-cloud-platform-abap-environment-is-live/
Well considering you have an S4 system you could just implement your Query as a CDS View.
Why?
SAP is not a database, it's a set of business solutions. Consultants and customers should change it the very least they can to map their desired business processes. The reason is that any change we make has an implementation cost, a maintenance cost, support cost and an upgrade and evolutionary cost. Those costs are not negligible and add over SAP licensing costs. Also, using standard objects is a smart way to use the potential of SAP designed solutions, adhere solution to SAP already available support, facilitate learning curve and future support by using familiar objects, reduce system footprint and allow an easier migration to a SAP standard solution case it exists in the future. Always reduce coding, always search for standard options. Coding and new database tables should be the last option, they should be used mainly on improving user experience, new processes should be implemented over standard ones.
Ah, right. Thank you. We actually use SAP a bit out of the ordinary, in the almost none of our processes use actual SAP. We are like 95% custom code or more.
&gt; I heard that SAP is also not focusing very much on it anymore It is actually the opposite. There is increasing focus on ABAP: [https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ABAP-Versions.png](https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ABAP-Versions.png)
ABAP won't die any time soon, as there will still be organisations that depend on it for many years to come. It may end up having to sit at the old people's table with COBOL and Fortran, but it wont kick the bucket any time soon.
