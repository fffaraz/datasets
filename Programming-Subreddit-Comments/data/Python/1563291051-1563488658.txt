If you're going to do an API I really can't recommended FastAPI enough.
Awesome, thanks
I'm not Italian, though I'll be moving there shortly. Your comment before just sort of resonated with some of my experiences.
A great start! There's a lot of literature out there to improve your results. If you want to enhance your results, I would next focus on methods that increase ITI (Inter target interval), increase signal-to-noise ratio (temporarily replace target letters with famous faces rather than highlight), and also try out a bunch of different algos. LDA works well, but 1-D CNNs also have promise.
Thanks for ideas! I've tried CNNs and for this data LDA provides better results I suppose checkerboard paradigm instead rows/cols highlights should provide better results &amp;#x200B; But I wanna reimplement it using Unity instead Tkinter first
Super interesting. I've seen their shop and prices are scary. Does any of you know any guide on how to DIY an EEG cap?
I think OpenBCI prices are much better than Emotiv for example and OpenBCI provides an aceess to raw data for free as well as data format description
Building a web app to support studying for my NRC exam coming up. The good: the website front end looks good and clean. I have a decent structure/layout that is clear and concise. I even made it responsive to desktop or mobile. The bad: can't seem to wrap my head around allowing users to log in with flask-login while also have an admin login. Also not sure how to host it so it's available to all of my classmates. I'm just a middle-aged hobby programmer that wishes I went to school for this... Oh well

Besides the lack of security updates it will be an issue if your code is still being developed. Imagine scenario where you are using a 3rd party package, and due to a new feature in your code you discovered a bug in that package. You did a research and looks like the bug was already found and fixed, but the newer package no longer works on Python 2, now you have following options: 1. create fork of the package, and fix the bug yourself 2. find the version that has the fix (possibly or will have other fixes as well), fork it and adapt it to work with Python 2.7 3. upgrade your application to Python 3 and use more recent version of the package This already happened with for example Python 2.6, but back then #2 and especially #3 were very easy. Often package that claimed to work with 2.7+ worked just fine with 2.6 or the fixes required were very minor. I'm Python 3 case though to support Python 2.7 it required to have an ugly code and dependency on packages like six. The ugly code will motivate developers to actively remove the support, so adding it back will once again be a bit of work that you could spend doing #3. Ultimately amount of work to do #1 and lack of ability to use new features will make #3 more and more attractive.
I made a post about this, but [Battle PAC](https://www.battlepac.com) is my outside-of-work focus this week. tl;dr - it's a webapp on top of a legit Super PAC for taking political contributions. Each contribution is in the name of a particular candidate, and whichever candidate raises the most money wins all of the money. It launched yday, and is running! But after posting here I got a TON of feedback for improving it and additional functionality that I'll be digging into.

Yes playing around with the pattern is another good idea. What I did that had good results is to do the first round as one flash each for rectangles of size 2 x 3. After that you can then do a secondary pattern where you flash one character from each rectangle at the same time. You get the same efficiency, but the signal is enhanced because there is less distraction on the screen. Also, when your target does flash it pops quite a bit more when it is part of a 2 x 3 group. Glad to see other people are using the OpenBCI!
Everyone is talking about security patches, when in reality lack of support from 3rd party packages is what will be the biggest pain if you are still working on 2.7 code base. And dropping support already started since maintaining compatibility results in ugly code: https://python3statement.org/
It is extremely unlikely that anything like that happen to Python or any other language. What will motivate people to migrate is not security patches, but 3rd party packages support. Maintaining 2.7 and 3.x compatibility is not good for your health. Many packages don't even wait for 2020 and already dropped the support.
I don't get it
The X values you printed are the linear fit line. Presumable your actual X values are the blue points.
No I didn't. busy working on another project. You can try it. Just replace the mask/ of openCV used for detecting specific colors in an image, with the above line of code and u r done.
The thing is with Python 3 migration that there is a large period of time when you don't have working python 3 code, once you do, you already finished work. There is short time between that and switching to use Python 3 code, but that time should be hopefully short. This is when CI would help.

Makes sense, I mostly wrap C code. I'll keep that in mind if I ever need to worry about templates!
I'd love some help. I've definitely been busier in the last year, so have had a lot less time to work on it. It's worked in python 3 since ~2012 and is python 3 only as of this May, so that part is done. I like the GUI, but that's the area that probably could benefit from the most work. Really though, I'd take any help that I can. I'd be nice to develop it through something like the SBIR or STTR program, but those programs aren't meant for stuff like that.
you look at the screen and record EEG data, you look/think about specific symbol on the screen, when row/col with this specific symbol is highlighted after \~300ms(in fact I get data from \~100ms to 850ms) there will be a special pattern on EEG diagram. I need to repeat it \~15 times because EEG data is noisy, so to clean data I need to average 15 results. Finally your character is determined bu intersection of row and col. &amp;#x200B; When you look at "A" and third col is highlighted there is no peak at EEG signal but when you look at "A" and first row is highlightes there will be a peak

Speak of the [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) devil. I find it educational to duplicate programs and see how they come out. I learn lots of stuff doing these kinds of attempted duplication. Sometimes it triggers new feature development. The same program in PySimpleGUI, when removing all blank lines, is only 1 line of code shorter. It's hard to save very much code in 20 lines. But, the advantage here is that the code is perhaps more readable, and this program worked on tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi by changing only the first line of the program. Here's a shot of tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi running the same code.

Some interns are more qualified than regular employees, but I agree, actually porting is done much better when you have intimate understanding of the code base and also have experience programming in both versions, so not anyone will be good at this. I personally added pylint (with py3k option to warn on introducing Python 2 specific code) and mypy to find all Unicode bytes mixups l. This run on every summited PR and highlighted problems. These things help to make everyone contribute towards migration. While I didn't use it looks like futurize stage1 can do a lot of dumb manual labor. With mypy I would also enable it gradually per module after adding typing information (this is where familiarity with code base helps a lot, because you have to guess function signatures), when you enable it on the entire codebase, it will be very noisy and cause other developers to start ignoring it.

It is python that compiles to .NET framework (you know C# etc) there is also Jython that runs on JVM
Oh got it, very interesting!
Why don't you start the process though? You can make the code work on Python 2 and 3. Similarly at my previous company no one was planning to migrate, I suggested that to my boss and he said ok and I started the migration process. The fact that Python 2.7 now shows a warning on startup since 2019 also helps.
Your enterprise tech company in the bay area still has a lot of 2.7 python code........ 🙈🙊🙉🤣😂.... Wait wait..... You are a enterprise tech company in the bay area..... And you dont know what to do with the python 2.7 problem...... 😂🤣🙉🙊🙈..... Okay who are you trying to fool here...... 🤣😂🤣. You had me fooled 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
That's looks interesting, will def use it if I will be forced to use Python2.7 (unlikely at this point, but who knows). BTW Another approach is to use Cython you can actually use it to mix Python 2 and 3 code together, but that's due to compiling Python code to C.

why no mention of [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/)
What do you not like about Jinja?
The biggest problem when migrating the code to 3 is that most of Python 2 code is actually broken and needs to be fixed which can't be automated. I'm taking about python 2 mixing strings with bytes which works fine for us-ascii, but breaks with other characters. Python 3 doesn't allow that anymore and forces you to do things correctly and that's the biggest hurdle, all of the other changes can be automated.

Have you tried integrating a smart keyboard like SwiftKey at all? I did play around with the concept a few years ago, but struggled to get a reliable signal in a non-shilded room.
Because I hadn't heard of it - I almost exclusively use Cython so my experience with other methods is limited. I mentioned that others should chime in with other resources or comments, because it'd be foolish for me to think I'm aware of all of the tools available in Python when the community is so massive
Wish I’d read this article two years ago. I had a project that involved some heavy image processing and some responsive actions. A first thread just pulled images from a camera and stored them in a queue; a second thread pulled them out of the queue and processed them; and a third thread took some actions based on the processing. I was dismayed that it didn’t work at all: the first thread and second thread constantly fought over the CPU, and the third thread didn’t get to run in a timely manner. I redesigned it as a multiprocess application, which made much better use of the multicore CPU. The first process shoved the images into a named pipe, and the second process had to pull them out to process them. Unfortunately, performance still sucked because named pipes are ssslllooowww. I tried some other things: multiprocessing Queues, Numpy shared arrays, etc. I don’t remember which solution I settled on, but I remember that none of them were consistently fast (both in data transfer and in event notification) and reliable (some of them did not consistently deliver event notifications; the receiver would either not be notified when data was waiting, or would be notified incorrectly when no data was waiting, resulting in an exception). Very frustrating.
Just import the modules and kick off their main functions?
It would be more helpful if you also gave examples of the use, like math.dist((5,7),(1,2)). My favourites: * Doubled the speed of class variable writes. When a non-dunder attribute was updated, there was an unnecessary call to update slots. (Contributed by Stefan Behnel, Pablo Galindo Salgado, Raymond Hettinger, Neil Schemenauer, and Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-36012](https://bugs.python.org/issue36012).) * Reduced an overhead of converting arguments passed to many builtin functions and methods. This sped up calling some simple builtin functions and methods up to 20–50%. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-23867](https://bugs.python.org/issue23867), [bpo-35582](https://bugs.python.org/issue35582) and [bpo-36127](https://bugs.python.org/issue36127).)
That is a pretty amazing first effort! Some quick thoughts: Instead of using the global "on" and toggling that variable to match the state you expect the GPIO pin to be in; try to read the actual state of the pin. GPIO.input(18) should return True if pin 18 is actually in a GPIO.HIGH state. TKinter isn't the most intuitive python module and most examples online don't follow the python patterns that others here have mentioned. Most good python code avoids the use of global variables and thus you don't often see external variables referenced from within a function. Usually you'd see a class method that references an attribute of the class, as opposed to a global function that references a global variable. In your "func" function, you set the button's font attribute to 'futura'. That attribute was already set back when you instantiated the button with "button = Button(root, text='RECORD'....)". Once you've instantiated the button, attributes only change when you tell them to change, so when you change the button's appearance in the "func" function, you don't need to set the font attribute again. On the other hand, in "func" if not "on"; you set the activebackground and activeforeground attributes but if "on" those attributes aren't reverted. The result is that a mouse-over when the box says "RECORD" inverts the button's colors but a mouse-over when the box says "ROLLING" doesn't invert the button's colors. I'm not sure if that's the behavior you expected or not. For a first attempt at programming, I'm blown away. As you are learning, consider signing up at github (or similar) and getting yourself familiar with git. It will let you version-control, share, collaborate and store your code. Almost all major projects use a form of source control management and git is the de-facto standard. Next time you want some help with your code, you'd be able to share the github project page and other developers can submit their suggested changes right to your project. You can then decide if you want to pull in their suggestions to your working code.
That's ok! I've edited my initial response to give some more context!
&gt;I've added my own and pretty stupid words suggestion system(last row in the video) I think it's easy to add smth like [https://presage.sourceforge.io/](https://presage.sourceforge.io/) (this project was used by Intel in their system for Stephen Hawking and it works well)

Do you live in soviet russia?
Ha no. My family and I have had our ideas stolen countless times via casual conversation. You really can’t trust other people. Be careful.
Yep thanks for clarifying. You can Google search python format strings and quickly find plenty of help.
Yeah, this could be rather nice.
Mind controlled text editor has existed for ages - VIM This is some future tech though.
Not a huge deal for rando scripts but if you have some kind of production system where you build millions of strings you will notice a time difference too. The adding strings like math approach is real slow compared to f strings
 for _ in range(5): a, b = b, a + b
No I'm too lazy. If you Google search python format strings you will find plenty of great explanations. Googling and finding answers is a skill for software nerds I ain't doin all ur homework for ya
RIP interns. That will happen
Shout out for a much, much more sane systems programming language: rust. Imagine using C, with all of the performance and power that entails, but memory safe by default, with an excellent package manager, modern language features, and a well-defined 3rd party library ecosystem. pyo3 is the library for rust/python bindings and it's pretty good given how young it is.

It's not easy to answer this question, because it is *very subjective*. First of all, i think Jinja is a great tool, but technology has advanced a lot since it was created. Also, i don't want to say this project is better, it's just an alternative i implemented because it's much more convenient and productive for me to use and i hope others will find it useful as well.
I have no power to influence product, but I do what I can on my own.
that sounds like a mess, hope I never have to use it.
But this is creating completely new music? No one is missing a stream because people were not looking for normal music, but Nightcore Piracy is good
Wow really cool! And yeah I find lines of code alone (especially when the program is already quite short) shouldn't be used to measure usability. Even if it means a little more effort up front, I know now that it's almost always worth it 6 months later when you're realizing how badly factored your code is.
There are two different parts to your post: 1) You claim this is sufficiently different music that it should be considered free-use. It doesn't seem that way to me, and it probably wouldn't be considered that by a court. I suppose if you feel strongly about it, you can write your congressperson to try to pass a "Nightcore exception." 2) You say piracy is good. Whether we agree on that is irrelevant, because they aren't pirating anything here. They're taking credit for it. It's the difference between finding a journal article for free online from a sketchy source and plagiarising that article in your own paper.

Rust is still too young to be considered a production-ready systems programming language ready to replace C in quite a few large and meaningful ways. Until those issues are resolved, it is somewhat irresponsible to use it as such. - There is no epoll/select of any kind, everything must be a task per socket. Period. The bug was closed...with zero plans to improve/change the mechanisms available (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14961) - Rust is quite portable, but NOWHERE near as portable as C. I don't think reducing portability makes a language a replacement for C. - Rust has no stable/consistent ABI at all. - There isn't even a spec for rust and there is only one implementation of it currently. That means one compiler only and that compiler MUST handle ALL THAT C CURRENTLY DOES before it can be ready to replace it. It doesn't, so it isn't ready. - The single implementation and lack of a spec means the language hasn't been tested as a language outside of it's current implementation. C does not suffer this problem as it has been implemented EVERYWHERE and the C spec has been thoroughly vetted/tested/implemented numerous times. Rust has nowhere near this level of implementation testing and won't until long after it finally gets an implementation specification. Rust is a great language, but it is NOT ready to replace C.

Cool! Thanks for sharing!
&gt; Unlike y2k where **everything** did change at a specific date (emphasis mine) Not to detract from your point about a hard date, but Y2K was only the rollover date for systems that stored the year with two digits, not everything. Systems with Unix-style timestamps use 32 bits to represent the offset from the start of 1970 in seconds. That doesn't rollover until 2038, which is still a hard date to have every affected system patched or replaced. I imagine there will be python2 stuff running for quite some time because of all the in-house programs that "still work" so unless it's busy work for an intern, management won't want to invest developer time on porting them until something finally stops working.
Having used the Python C-API extensively in my own projects I would recommend not slitting your wrists and save yourself a ton of time and pain and just use C++ with pybind11 (https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for building extensions. It is well supported and several major libraries (like PyTorch) use it.
There is a journal of open source software. Failing that write a blog article and tweet it or share here?
Do you have a recommendation for a good tutorial/walkthrough for CFFI? I have used something similar for a very basic DLL wrapper but can't help feel like I didn't do it as well as I could have.

 def defaultThread(interval, func, *args): stopped = Event() def loop(): while not stopped.wait(interval): func(*args) Thread(target=loop, daemon=True).start() return stopped.set I found this function on StackOverflow at some point and I find myself going back to old code to grab it occasionally. It lets you make a thread from wherever that just calls a function: thread = defaultThread(timer, func, args) Then you can just end it with: thread()
I'll definitely work my way through those, thank you. Went back and checked my old code... I had used `ctypes` which requires(required) you to basically redefine everything you wanted over again in your Python code before using.
Yeah I looked at ctypes too because it's installed by default but that aspect put me off. After trying cffi, where you don't have to do this, I think I won't look back
I haven't used Rust very much beyond toy projects, but it doesn't have to be a complete replacement for C to be useful. I would define production-ready as stable execution, with a solid capacity for maintenance (security, etc...). Unless you dispute those, I'd say that none of your points convince me not to consider it for a Python extension.
&gt;I haven't used Rust very much beyond toy projects, but it doesn't have to be a complete replacement for C to be useful. If it is gonna replace C for python plugins, then yes it does. Which is what was suggested.
Is that the correct usage of the "walrus" operator? I think in this example the if-statement just is always true, and assigns "current" to "n". I thought to be useful it should be like: if (n:=current) == last: # Do stuff here Where the above statement checks if "current" (now assigned to "n") is equal to "last". Is this correct?
I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to write something that could act as a digital environmental controller. I have no idea how/if python can interact with hardware, specifically temperature, c02 and humidity sensors.
I think you are correct. Here is the official example &amp;#x200B; if (n := len(a)) &gt; 10: print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected &lt;= 10)")
I feel it's a waste of an advantage to have a potentially great idea, only to have someone steal it because you wanted to share your process with a good friend. But based on what you've said, I feel it's a learning process to decide which projects to share and which to not. Thanks for the insight!
Thanks so much for the response. I will look into this!
Ok, thanks for the sanity check - I thought that was moreso the intended usage.
Working on scraping a betting website to get football (soccer for the Americans) fixtures and odds for each fixture, then compare to my own (very basic) modeled odds for each fixture. Only problem is my own data will have slight differences either in spelling or the abbreviated team names etc, so I need to work out how to match them up. I'm thinking either looking into fuzzy wuzzy or just manually writing up a mapping of all my team names to the betting sites team names which I can then use to look up going forward.
On toilet response: as long as you switched from processing the whole images to some form of addressing them for IPC, you're golden. Never pass content around components unless you must.
I uses his code and rebuilt it for reddit and am regretting it now. I added a function to save the images, put that into a loop and cluttered my hard drive with 3gigs of not kitten pictures &gt;_&lt;
Agreed. You can test each individual component though a python shell.

GigaScience, bioinformatics might be worth taking a look at, depending on the application of the package, but I'm a bioinformatician so I'm biased. :) Otherwise people have recommended me the journal of open software.

Could someone explain this bit? Didn't really get it. `In fact, it happens due to the fact that when a thread does not need a CPU resource, it frees GIL. At this moment, both threads can try to get it. At the same time, the operating system knows that there are many cores. Thus, it can intensify this situation by trying to distribute the threads between the cores.`
I used to work at a student loan refi startup in the Bay Area which had this problem. Not a particularly small one, either. Literally too stupid to believe, I know, but I had to live it.
its saying: `from matplotlib import style` `ImportError: cannot import name style`
You'd think that in a programming subred someone would have written a bot to handle stuff like this. &amp;#x200B; Anyone know where to learn about writing bots? :)
when I said everything it was meant to encompass the class of systems vulnerable to y2k. Much like all code running on 2.7 is of the class of python2.7.
idk if this is a joke
I can't read this atm, but can I use this to I run multiple simultaneous data crunching operations? I'm just using pandas...

Consider loading this into a mySQL database and working with it from there. In a day you can get get good enough with queries to do some analysis, or use pandas and SQL together. If you don't have enough memory to load this, you'll have to do something similar eventually. If you have some money, amazon EC2 instances are a good way to go.
I would suggest: * JORS, the [Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/), an open journal that has won an award from the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) * The [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) publishes **extremely** short software descriptions. * [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) might not be a perfect fit, given your description, but check anyway. * [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/) is from El$evier. A lot of journals will publish descriptions of software if you embed it in a short application. Also, you can use [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to get a DOI for each version of your software, just in case you want something that can be cited easily.
i saw that video but i wasnt sure if its good or not. Thankss
My question is what are you parsing through that needs 100 million rows of a txt file
Have a look at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ It is both a free ebook and a YouTube series. It is a really nice introduction to python
Can you share your code.
Perhaps create user groups and limit the admin options to the Admin user group?
Have you tried setting the columns to read in the read_csv? From your example you only seem to need one column. That may help you negate the iterative approach. Furthermore, try tuning the chunk size to be as large as possible and avoid apply. If pandas cannot optimise it, it will default to a python loop, which is terribly slow
thanks a lot
I made an file of all known chemical compounds known today for a project so I need to run certain calculations on each of them
That’s pretty cool
I tried that but still nothing...
oh, no. george irwin stevens. of the eastern stevens. not those western stevens. those people are weird.
Thanks I’ll look up GDscript and find out some more about it
It’s the official scripting language for Godot, so I’d definitely start with the official documentation. Good luck!
Use dask specifically if you are dealing with numpy/pandas etc. Great lib
Look into dask (python lib for parallelizing operations on dataframes)
Thanks! I’m relatively new to coding, so this will help me out a lot
Youtube: Two of my favourite channels that cover python are: Sendtdex Thenewboston Both are great.
As a general principle, I agree. But in this case: * One worker was minding the camera input queue - trying to fetch images as soon as possible, so that the freshest image was available for processing *and* the queue wasn’t getting full of stale images. * The other worker was performing some computationally intensive image processing and returning results as fast as possible. (General scenario: Image-guided HID pointer.) I couldn’t move any image processing into the first worker. It would stall the camera and cause delays in the intake of images. I couldn’t establish any kind of synchrony between the workers. The image processing worker would sometimes finish fast, and sometimes take a while - so long that it would have multiple images queued up for processing next, and would have to throw away enqueued images until it got to the most recent one. It would have been a hell of a lot easier to design it as a triple-buffered system: the image that’s being processed, the image that’s ready to be processed, and an incoming image being read from the queue (which is swapped with the second buffer if the worker stalls and an image needs to be discarded). But cross-process memory sharing is strictly verboten, so that wasn’t an option. In all - an interesting project with non-ideal solutions. Still fun. What we ended up with wasn’t great, but it met our requirements.
Thanks, I really hope that helps me find some optimization.
Pandas allows you to read files in chunks. Check read csv documentation. It makes a generator which returns you the amount of rows you need per iteration
Like this: def func(): global on if on: # code to turn off else: # code to turn on on = not on
What do you mean nothing? There's a *lot* of Google results.
The addition of Literal[] and Final[] to typing will be good. Even if not using any other type hints, having your linter tell you that a variable is not supposed to be changed, or should only be changed to a limited number of values will be better than searching for where/why they are defined. (Or accidentally reusing a variable name and over-writing it) And I'm looking forward to the walrus operator: it feels like about half my code is assigning a variable, then checking if it True or not None. Now can do it in one line!
Thanks :)
This, dask-tutorial is great too to learn. Specially with jupyter nb, one of the best py learning resources format.
No problem. If.you like the name Sally, choose sentdex. If you like tuna, choose thenewBoston
It would make more sense if he was assigning the return of a current function to n. Then it would check if n is truthy and make it available in the block scope. It seems pointless to just assign a variable to another name.
It can read from them for sure. Google some tutorials on weather stations made with python or something like that 👍🏼 adafruit sells a lot of those sensors too. I was reading about this stuff a couple years ago!

Google also offers a free Python course. https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
It's hard to tell what's going on here with what you've given us - you might format your code so that we know where the to\_csv call sits (unless you are appending you may have an issue here). Why even use pandas here though? There is a lot of overhead with the pd.read\_csv and to\_csv operations. Just use vanilla Python operations and do something like this: with open("file/out/path.csv", "w") as out: with open("file/in/path.csv", "r") as handle: for line in handle: line = line.strip("\n").split(",") # do whatever you need with the element here # using element 2 arbitrarily for the sake of the # example line[2] = your_function(line[2]) out.write(",".join(line)) out.write("\n") Even for 5.7 GB and a very slow computer this should be significantly quicker than using Pandas
I'm not sure I understand why the `player_id` foreign key column is tied to a sequence and auto-incrementing. When using ORM models SQLAlchemy will take care of populating the foreign key columns for you: player = AccountCreation(email="bob@bob.com", password="bobpw") print(player.id) # this is going to print None db.session.add(player) db.session.commit() print(player.id) # this will print 1, or whatever the current max ID is another_obj.player = player # if another_obj's class has a foreign key to player, SQLAlchemy will populate the column when you make this assignment One important thing to note is that for the above example to work, you'd need to add: player = db.relationship("AccountCreation") To the relevant related models. Hopefully this helps shed some light on things, if not, let me know!
In my opinion, this is the best way to learn: Come up with a project you are passionate about. For example, let's say you want to create a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Naturally, you will need a math formula to do this. Let's Google that. T=temperature Celsius to Fahrenheit T(°C) × 9/5 + 32 = T(°F) Fahrenheit to Celsius T(°F) − 32 × 5/9 = T(°C) Okay, we have our formulas, now how do I do math in Python? Let's Google that. Nice I found this page: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions Okay let's write some code with the help of that resource def celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature): fahrenheit = (temperature * 9/5) + 32 return fahrenheit def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature): celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5/9 return celsius Nice we have some functions we can use now. Okay now we need a way for the user to provide input. You have some options. You could make a desktop application, a website application using something like Flask or Django, an SMS application, a Slack bot application, and many more. But for this example, we will simply allow user input using Python's input() function. Docs on the input function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input First, the user needs to indicate what unit they want to convert to. unit_of_temperature = input('Would you like to convert to Fahrenheit or Celsius? Type F for Fahrenheit or C for Celsius: ') We also need to collect the temperature value. value_of_temperature = input('Temperature: ') Now we use a conditional statement to determine which function we should use. if unit_of_temperature == 'F': print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(value_of_temperature)) elif unit_of_temperature == 'C': print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(value_of_temperature)) else: print('Error. Not a valid temperature unit. Use F or C') The point is that you will be motivation to work on a project you are passionate about with the benefit of learning along the way. Google is a very valuable tool. Learn to use it. Good luck!
My favourite: Turbo Pascal 2.0. Editor and compiler in 32k. Uses Wordstar editing codes. Best program ever made.
That's a whole lot of work for a very simple operation that can be done quickly with vanilla Python
I love you &lt;3 Thanks you so much
I should also say that I need to apply these filters to multiple files that are of the same nature, hence why having a pipeline that could apply these filters to all of my files at once would be a huge time saver!

Python 2? In 2019?
Cool, thanks!

Question of unknown stupidity: Does putting tinfoil or something around the hardware limit interference?
Dask dataframes might help with very big files. Look for that library
Does Python even allow non-ASCII variable names?

Yep! But only a certain subset. https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python3_features.html#unicode-variable-names
This article is kinda poorly written, but I think what they are trying to get at there is the cost of context switching, especially when combined with the GIL. In case you don’t already know, the GIL usually means that only one python thread can operate at once, with the exception of file i/o, network i/o, and some compiled C extensions. If you are constantly switching between two blocking threads, the cost of switching itself adds significant overhead.
I used pip to install matplotlib, datetime, and pandas before I tried the following: import datetime as dt from matplotlib import style import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import pandas_datareader.data as web style.use('ggplot') start = dt.datetime(2000, 1, 1) end = dt.datetime(2016, 12, 31) df = web.DataReader('TSA', 'yahoo', start, end) print(df.head()) &amp;#x200B; When I ran the code, this was the output: High Low Open Close Volume Adj Close Date 2014-07-14 13.432 13.432 13.432 13.432 0.0 13.432 2014-07-15 13.527 13.527 13.527 13.527 0.0 13.527 2014-07-16 13.222 13.222 13.222 13.222 0.0 13.222 2014-07-17 12.890 12.890 12.890 12.890 0.0 12.890 2014-07-18 12.749 12.749 12.749 12.749 0.0 12.749 &amp;#x200B; You might be having problems importing matplotlib and reinstalling it might help.
You're the fuckin man, thanks very much for suggesting adafruit. I'm going to get into some weather station tutorials too.
😁 here I was thinking to myself... “they know about adafruit.” Glad I spoke up!!!
Interesting! Were the uwsgi improvements merged back upstream?
Makes sense, so basically there's going to be context switch everytime the GIL is released? Agree that its not well written, tbh surprised it has so many upvotes
New link https://discord.gg/GhQcER2
no way, that was a great suggestion. they have like 15 different temp/humidity sensors that are exactly what I need.
very helpful, thanks!
When I have cryptic error messages I just paste 'em into Google and the solution is usually in the first few results, usually from StackOverflow.
Yeah, I had to go back and reread it again just now and have updated my comment, but I believe the specific issue with that example is that while most file i/o does not require the GIL, calls to print() do. So each thread is blocked on the GIL on each iteration. I’m on my phone right now, but I think that if you open the file in write-append mode and replace the (rather unusual) use of print &gt;&gt; fout with calls to write, this problem would not occur. I’ll try to write up a script later and test this out, but it seems a bit contrived when file and network i/o is actually one of the things python threads are actually good for.
Now i have an excuse to be a python fullstack web dev. I like python.

&gt;Different OpenBCI boards use different communication protocols, here I used Cyton board and this headset [https://shop.openbci.com/products/ultracortex-mark-iv](https://shop.openbci.com/products/ultracortex-mark-iv) so board which sends data to your PC is placed directly behind the head and I dont think that it's possible to isolate it somehow using tinfoil until you dont wear tinfoil hat on top of OpenBCI headset
But the hardest to type, unless you have a freakishly strong left pinky
A few weeks ago I decided that I wanted to see if I could drive selenium webdriver (automate website actions) with only a yaml file (as the configuration). I decided to have a little one person “hackathon” one weekend to see if I could implement a proof of concept. It went very well, and now I’m busy writing that experiment into a maintainable application. This is just a just-for-fun-and-experience project at the moment, and I’m having a lot of fun with it. Oh, and YES I AM using well know encryption to store the website passwords for each site, as well as any credit card, bank account or personal information like addresses that the user might need to use.

Oops sorry I've led you astray. Yes you can globally declare the button (and you'll need to do the same for root). There are also other ways to do it, specifically to take all that state at global and module level and put it on an instance of a class. That would be object oriented programming. After you've made your way through the tutorial and feel like you understand the object oriented bits you can go on and look at the tkinter docs to see how Tk is normally used with object oriented concepts.

Why not import the files into access, into a single table, perform the filtering either before or after, and then summarize that final dataset?
 import random while True: print(random.randint(0,9), end='') # PROVE ME WRONG
Ok, so I went and did some testing. I initially thought the threaded version might be slower due to using print rather than something like write in append mode. While threaded print was slower than threaded write, both were still slower than the non-threaded version. That was in Python 2.7. I then tried it in python 3.7, and the threaded versions were faster. So the author’s note is correct, that there was some issue with the GIL in earlier versions where some kind of thrashing occurs under heavy IO load. This seems to be covered well by Dave Beazly’s document [here](https://www.dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf) if you look at the section called Multicore GIL War and is what was fixed by the python 3 change to the GIL.

No because they're different programs. I find the numpy error much more helpful, not only does it give a traceback of where the error was produced in the code of the function, it tells you exactly why it failed: the shapes are wrong (5, 3). &amp;#x200B; "I want this program to behave like this other program I know" is really not a valid excuse or criticism of NumPy.

It's pretty wild to think that any set you generate would exist in PI even if you left your system running for eternity. On top of this PI would be infinity ahead of you when you did check.
Pi, by definition, has an infinite number of digits. There is no such thing as "the final digits". QED What do I win? ;-)
It is widely believed that pi is [normal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number), but not proven.

**Normal number** In mathematics, a normal number is a real number whose infinite sequence of digits in every positive integer base b is distributed uniformly in the sense that each of the b digit values has the same natural density 1/b, also all possible b2 pairs of digits are equally likely with density b−2, all b3 triplets of digits equally likely with density b−3, etc. Intuitively this means that no digit, or (finite) combination of digits, occurs more frequently than any other, and this is true whether the number is written in base 10, binary, or any other base. A normal number can be thought of as an infinite sequence of coin flips (binary) or rolls of a die (base 6). Even though there will be sequences such as 10, 100, or more consecutive tails (binary) or fives (base 6) or even 10, 100, or more repetitions of a sequence such as tail-head (two consecutive coin flips) or 6-1 (two consecutive rolls of a die), there will also be equally many of any other sequence of equal length. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Yeah I messed that part up
Good points! Yeah the walrus operator will be nice
I was under the impression that no-one had *proved* that pi is infinite. That said, the fatal flaw in my program is actually that the random number generator will eventually repeat itself, and thus expressible as a rational (and we can fairly easily prove Pi is not equal to whatever that rational is).
Seconding JOSS + Zenodo; a combination that makes both publication and citing really, really easy.
&gt; I was under the impression that no-one had proved that pi is infinite. Pi is irrational, which means it does not terminate. I'm not sure what the proof consists of, but I know it does exist.

I am making a daily commit service for github users. I'd like to provide a bulletin board that shows whether people subscribed to the service are committed.

This guys needs some more respect ✊
I did not give you the part where you have to set the initial state of the variables, or the part where you have to do something with what the loop gives you. At the moment, it will run and end with the last a &amp; b. With a little work, you should be able to set a beginning (if you want one) and length of sequence to return.
I saw your edit. And yet not everyone agrees with that rule. Do you follow all rules put forth by pylint? Dogmatism is the hallmark of someone who has shit for brains.
Neither of these were bugs in a programming language. First two are vulnerabilities in CPU, the last one was vulnerability in openssl, which Python uses, but the EOL wouldn't affect it, all you have to recompile Python to use fixed version of openssl.
I am surprised the multiprocessing queues failed. I haven’t had a problem with them. But it sounds like you had a pretty complex process. I wonder if you could have used a universal queue with some priority algorithm that got consumed by all of the processors. Not sure of how it would work to subclass a multiprocessing queue to specify priority though. Maybe a custom sorter on its own thread that puts items into a single queue. Sounds like a fun problem
I think you're confusing irrational with normal. Pi is definitely irrational, therefore it has infinitely many digits. What's not proven is if it's normal or not, which would mean it is also disjunctive (the thing about "pi contains every sequence").
So first of all, look at the last line to find the actual error. The rest of it is the traceback of function calls that led to that error. The stuff at the top might be your code but as you get further down it's likely to be code from a module.
&gt;It's not that I'm not fluent in Python. I've used Python for a lot of webdev related work. Wait... Hold on... You are fluent in Python, you used it a lot for webdev and you don't know what traceback is and how to read it? These errors are not "CS-ey", they are... errm... "programey". Matlab is made for mathematicians, Python/numpy is for programmers. That's all. If you prefer simpler errors, use Matlab (it's still very good). If you don't like to see tracebacks, catch the exception and print only the message... but I'm sure you know that, since you are fluent in Python, so what is the purpose of this post?
Needs more RAM
I suspect your issue is related to the disconnect that **all** matlab arrays at &gt;= 2D. In Numpy, they have 0 and 1 dim arrays too. Try making them 2D (and you may or may not need to transpose one or both of them). It may be a stop gap until you better understand the broadcasting. Or, this may be the best approach. I don’t know for sure
Websites offer services to the public are treated under common-carrier. It was tested very early on with Geocities IIRC. e.g. Because Geocities let anyone make their own little personal website and didn't curate nor censor they were given 1^st amendment protections.
Also, do you want linspace or arange?
Searching this I see no reference to Geocities in any common-carrier rulings.
What you do in python is separate from doing it manually. If you want to store it in a DB, sqlite may be more appropriate. It’s a single file and does not need a server or anything. But 10,000x8 is *really* small in memory terms. I mean, huge in manual terms but you can store that is memory. And/or a JSON file. Or a CSV, etc. but a full SQL solution is overkill. And you likely do not need a linked list. Even if you’re not the most efficient for the migration, you are still well within a small amount of data. It’s good to think about scale, but do not prematurely optimize. It’s just not worth it here. And if you do need to eventually optimize, profile this first.
Not 100% sure if this would work, but maybe allocating the entire SD card to swap? Of course this would have to be done on a Linux machine but it would probably work.

Im playing around with a local redis instance to act as a first in, first out queue system. My current script spins up multiple separate python processes for the same script, however they can sometimes perform overlapping tasks which is problematic. &amp;#x200B; The plan is to route all the commands into a redis list and have a separate script acting as a daemon constantly watching the list. When content is available it begins a task, and goes one by one down the queue until the queue is cleared. &amp;#x200B; Current hurdles: I need a way to clear the task queue on command. I need a way to separate valid commands from invalid commands to avoid unnecessary congestion. And I need to speedup or consolidate my scripts "finally" activities.
Why has no one thought of this before??????

Thank you for the suggestion! I labeled then merged the tables, sorted by time, then filled in the gaps with the last non-NA.
Thanks for the suggestion! I did something similar but in between rows with non-NA counts, the values were 0, although they should be the last non-NA value.

Talk to your school admins and shame them for not promoting learning. You never know. It might work.
It depends on what the front-end is really doing. `react` is typically useful in only "front-end heavy" or single page apps where most of the interaction like routing, form validation, interactive controls like calendars for scheduling, etc. is happening on client side. If your front-end consists of basic html inputs, react will be an overkill.
Try the CSV reader with the standard library. If pandas is being weird with it, that's one thing, but it's a Guido problem if the standard library's code is verifiably regressing. I expect you'll have much better chances with it. Also, don't worry about memory leaks - it's Python's job to handle that, not yours. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
Give some more context. Is the variable something like an environment setting (OS name, directory of all your test data, etc.), or is it a lot of data that you need to stream from one place to another?
Uh, no Pandas is not for everyone. Data modelling is non-trivial. Most of us need to understand relational data. So at a minimum folks should understand the use cases for heterogeneous and time series data and relational data. Further there are data models as simple as key-value pairs that fit nicely into NOSQL databases like Mongodb. When I teach beginners I recommend they stick with pure Python until they have a good degree of confidence. If your first Python project is primarily interfacing with compiled libraries like Numpy and Pandas things can get frustrating leaving the Python world. Further, one should understand the use cases for just using the CSV library and when there is no need for Pandas. Also, ETL is a use case Pandas has no business being part of. There is a very helpful project called PETL that can swizzle the CSV files and lazy evaluate large data sets. A better title would be "The Case For Pandas: A Tool Python Developers Should Have."
well just play with the base part of the task. Lets say i try this with base pi. So let me calculate a bit. Yeah the program finally terminated. Its 10!!!

It's not a joke, except it was written to be funny. &amp;#x200B; If you go over to I think it's /r/firearms they have a bot called "gunnit" and you can say something "gunnit &lt;subject&gt;" and the bot will post FAQ like material for &lt;subject&gt; &amp;#x200B; For example, one could type "pybot Learn Python" and have the bot post a bunch of learning resources. Or you could have a smarter bot looks for "learn" in the subject, and then looks for a secondary key word. If it finds a secondary keyword--say "Panda" or "Web Development" it could bring up a list of learning resources for that. &amp;#x200B; You know, automate the boring stuff away :)

You need to create it. Create a praw.ini file in the same directory that your program is in. Note that tutorial is very old, and praw has undergone some backwards incompatible changes in the past few years. You may have to install an old version of praw or get a newer tutorial. Use /r/learnpython for any other questions.

Is Starlette necessary or can I integrate it with other frameworks? As it is, while this looks promising I can't use it. :(
I always found that praw.ini was an actual meme of a concept. Just use environment variables.
I can't believe everyone is so blase about this. This is blowing my mind.
Congrats! This looks like it took quite a bit of work.
I'd not heard of boost.python before, so I was curious and was reading the docs: https://wiki.python.org/moin/boost.python/GettingStarted where they state: "Using the Python/C API, you have to deal with passing pointers back and forth between Python and C, and worry about pointers hanging out in one place when the object they point to has been thrown away. Boost::Python takes care of much of this for you." How accurate is this statement? The reason I ask is that I've been dealing with a very unpleasant memory leak recently. The source of the leak is the allocation of a big chunk of memory in a function in a C++ dll. The function gets called repeatedly from python, and returns a pointer to an array which is then passed into numpy. The problem is that: 1) I can't free the memory in C++ when I pass the pointer back because I still need to access the array from python. 2) the memory is allocated locally not globally so can't be freed by another function in the DLL 3) I can't free the memory from python so I'm left with a memory leak that I know the cause of, but can't do anything to prevent, and if boost.python can help, I'll be an instant convert

If someone "steals your idea" does it matter? Can there only be one solution based on the idea? No. Once you publish the project, the idea will go out there anyway. If you never want someone to use your idea, you can never publish it. From business perspective, sure you maybe don't want to spread your idea before you publish your own project, just to get an advantage yourself.
`print(str(τ/2)[::-1])`
The general Python way to do this is: (1) in Excel, to export each file as a comma-separated value file (CSV) https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/6409-saving-an-excel-file-as-a-csv-file (2) import into Python using the module pandas (you want a dataframe): https://datatofish.com/import-csv-file-python-using-pandas/ (3) then you can use panda functions to filter the data as you wish: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-with-python-intro-to-loading-and-subsetting-data-with-pandas-9f26895ddd7f (4) export the file as a csv file, which excel can read. If you get the code set up correctly, you can just feed it a list of filenames. The only thing that would slow it down is the need to convert each excel file to a csv file and reload it. There are some tools out there for directly reading and altering Excel files as-is, but that could get tricky fast, I’d stick to a CSV format for pandas. That’s a lot of work for a beginner though be warned! A very useful skill though.

Can Pi be expressed rationally in a different base?
https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder/issues/216
Being rational or irrational doesn't depend on the base. Pi is always irrational. If you're asking if it never terminates and never repeats, then yes, at least in rational bases. In a rational base, all irrational numbers will never terminate and never repeat. In base pi though, pi is just 10. It's still irrational, but it has a finite length.
True, but you can at least *begin* to write it forwards.
What are the advantages over strawberry? I've been looking to replace django rest framework with GraphQL and have been considering strawberry. Disclaimer: I haven't done much with GraphQL. My background is moreso in functional programming, so the typed dataclass design of both is intreging. I'm just wondering if there is any distinction between the two. Thanks!
I haven't used Boost::Python, but pybind11 has some nifty tools for [working with numpy arrays](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/pycpp/numpy.html) and there is also fine grained control over object/memory lifetime.
I'm not a web developer, but I would recommend PyQt / PySide. It is a very mature framework, offering multiple approaches in developing UIs, including markup based systems, which mimic HTML/CSS. Alternatively you can code your UIs manually, or use the included visual UI design tool. You can develop anything from small scale, light-weight applications up to huge applications with it (for example, Autodesk's Maya 3D modeler 's UI is made with Qt). While being portable, Qt also manages to look pretty much like native UI elements on many systems. Personally, I find Qt quite intuitive, compared to its alternatives. It is well documented and has an active community of users. PySide2 is licensed as LGPL, so you can use it commercially.

&gt;The primary difference is, Strawberry is based on graphql-core-next, but Pygraphy write the whole things for own. And there is some conflict between Python and graphql-core-next, you can see https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/95 and https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-next/issues/37 to get more info. - Strawberry - Disadvantages - Can not solve the empty self problem and others which is caused by graphql-core-next - Advantages - Can move fast cause no need for writing everything - Already stabled - Pygraphy - Disadvantages - Needs to write the whole GraphQL spec without graphql-core - Not stabled yet, need more feedback - Advantages - Rewrite the whole spec in Pythonic way, you will fill harmonious if you are a perfectionist
Why is that

Have you checked whether your system recognizes python? I had a similar problem because my comp did not recognize that I had python installed. Either way the problem might be that its not recognized as an environment variable, at least that was my problem. In which case you should simply add it as such, a simple google search should tell you how

Python probably
A good GUI to start with if you're a newcomer to Python is [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). It's easy to pick up. You can often learn it and write your application in a single afternoon (not kidding). There is a Cookbook and almost 200 Demo Programs to give you a jump start. The idea is to get a GUI on your screen in 5 minutes and then give you something working that you can hack on and turn into your application. The documentation, already good, has been going through a large update with the addition of docstrings onto all classes, methods, functions. Finally, you can run your code both on the desktop using tkinter, Qt or WxPython, and also on the Web using PySimpleGUIWeb, one of the 4 different ports.
Thanks, but it's not the numpy side that's the issue, it's memory allocation in C++ that becomes orphaned when the function call goes out of scope and then becomes impossible to free from the python side. The buffer protocol seems very useful, and would simplify a lot of the pain you get with ctypes. But the problem right now is that I don't know the size of the array to allocate until I'm midway through my C++ function, so I can't pass a fixed size buffer into the function, and returning a pointer together with the array size is the only way I can think to make it work. but the boost docs seemed to say they could deal with that which would be pretty impressive if so. Anyway, thanks for pointing out pybind11, definitely something to explore.
Building jobs section of a website. Wrote a scrapper to scrape job listings which will be incorporated into WordPress using an import plug-in. The scraping &amp; posting process will be automated using cron jobs.
So your C++ function returns a pointer to data, and its size? And you want that pointer freed when the last Python object that uses it goes away, I presume? That is definitely possible in pybind11.

Thank you very much!
this is the worst lie I've ever heard from somebody who's just trying to make an account cracker
Thank you, this cost me three hours last night. I had searched all over stackoverflow too. Again, thank you a ton.
Very cool, but i hope there's an escape sequence or no persistence after reboot, it also seems like this wasn't done with a virtual machine, which is near necessary if the thing you are developing is malicious, but despite those minor complaints that's fucking sick
Being irrational means you can't write the number as a fraction of two integers. All finite decimal numbers and repeating decimals in any integer base can be written as the fraction of two integers and thus Pi can not be either of those two regardless of base.
There is no such thing as a 'hex datatype'. `0x0B8558` is the hex string representation of a 24bit integer. To parse it back into an int, use the `int()` built-in with an appropiate base. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int &gt;&gt;&gt; int("0x0B8558", 16) 755032 Also -&gt; /r/learnpython
There's no such thing as hex data type. Hexadecimal is a representation of a number (same as decimal, octal etc). Convert it to integer, do calculations and convert the result back to hexadecimal to print it.
Well, technically that exact sequence of numbers exists in pi, and so does the backwards version of it. Math is weird

Hi, I understand what you are saying but I can't use the numerical datatype, I need to convert it back to an 0x0b8558 type. Also, while I can understand your /r/lernpython comment, python is very big and i've got about 20,000 lines of code under several programs and 6 years of experience. There are still little things people can struggle with. But cheers for the comment, you tried.
same 😂😂
I tried that but for some reason=, I can't seem to figure out how to convert it back to hexidecimal from the normal numerical int type.
 In [1]: h = "0x1234" In [2]: i = int(h, 16) In [3]: i Out[3]: 4660 In [4]: hex(i) Out[4]: '0x1234'
You do not need to be a beginner to ask questions in /r/learnpython. This is not about skill level, it is about not flooding the /r/python channel with questions better asked somewhere else. &gt;&gt;&gt; int("0x0B8558", 16) 755032 &gt;&gt;&gt; hex(755032) '0xb8558' With 6 years of experience I really don't understand what your actual question is. Converting between integer and hex-strings is no black magic, really. `hex()` is not a datatype. It is a function that turns an integer into a string. There is no "hex datatype".
Anytime buddy
&gt; Converting between integer and hex-strings is no black magic, really. We know this, but I still needed help and you are making me feel ashamed of my question and that isn't very nice. I also understand I am not using the correct terminology. You need to be more considerate or people's backgrounds in coding, just because they have a small gap in their knowledge, does not mean they need to 2learn Python" so to speak.
Thank you very much. This has helped me. Sometimes it is the little things that cost the most time!

&gt; The ctypes package can only load C functions that return values of type int, meaning that anything requiring values not divisible by 1 will involve a lot of passing by reference (an implementation method that is available in C, but not in Python). This is wrong. You can load **any** kind of C function using *ctypes* as long as you specify the restype. Example: # This is a C function that accepts as input 2 floats and return one float libc.myfunc.restype = ctypes.c_float libc.myfunc.argtypes = [ctypes.c_float, ctypes.float]

So u need to write up a program that starts the other program then navigates and clicks on everything such that it can highlight text based on some rule then paste that say into a text file and save that file with some name on a specified folder..... Possible breakdown: 1. How to start non api programs from python 2. How to click specific buttons and menus on said program 3. How to select and highlight text on said program based on some rules 4. Paste copied text to newly created text file by python program 5. Save text file into a specified folder with some specified name (assuming u need to make multiple files) This sounds doable, though I admit I'd have to learn all this myself as well but when I get back home I'll dig around see what I can send your way... Though by that time some experts here will likely have answered your questions about libraries and what not... Still it'll be interesting to see what turns up
[README.md](https://README.md)
You can use \`,\` commas instead of \`+\` for printing space separated content. There is no need to concat multiple strings. This is because print function support multiple arguments. Comments such as \`# uses at least 3 inputs in output\` doesn't add value. You can also check if a string is empty by simply using \`if name:\` no need to check the length.
Do those outweigh the negatives?
Have fun :) and let me know if you have any questions. The code of the demo page (`demo.py` in the repo) is not great to be honest - i started writing it for myself to test new components as i implemented them -, but it's probably good enough to get you started.
Except it wasn't.
"It's still Java, it's just not Java"
Few edits. 1. I'd use input('enter the text').lower() -&gt; this avoids any case sensitivity issue since no matter what the input is it's always going to be lower case. 2. I don't understand the point on using float in STR(int(float('xyz'))) and that too so many times. I'd just covert it while I'm taking in the input like: int(input('Enter the text')). Note, this will give you an error if you type something which can't be converted into an int. That brings me to my 3rd point. 3. Try using "try, except and finally" to handle errors in your program. 4. There are a lot of repetition of text, you could store them in a variable and use that again and again.
If I use 'if name == 0:' it moves on to 'else'. Did I misunderstand? I used this to prevent an error from not entering anything at the prompt.
My team also had a codebase in c++ + opencv and wanted to call it from python, we used this [http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html](http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html) . The documentation is plain horrible but swig work really well
1. Thanks for this. 2. That was to use math on a str and avoid an error from entering a float at the prompt. I used it multiple times because 'elif number == (1,2,3)' didn't work. 3. I gotta look these up. 4. Doh! Good one.
In the terminal. The program at the top. Can you type `history`, press enter, and show us the result?
Starting in the first line (though this is a matter of taste): use " rather than '. IMO looks cleaner and for docstrings you're supposed to use them anyway so it's just more consistent to only use " (again - just my taste). (In the case of your line \`print('That\\'s not what I asked. Goodbye.')\` it's actually wrong according to PEP8. These should definetly be double quotes no matter your taste.) &amp;#x200B; * \`if(len(name) == 0):\` I would omit the parantheses here and you don't need the \`== 0\` here since name will always be a string and a zero-sized string evaluates to false in a boolean context. so the line can be simplified/made more readable by going with \`if not name:\` * You're doing string concatenation/interpolation wrong. Wrong may sound a bit harsh because it works the way you're doing it - but with the current state of the language is less readable, less powerful and less performant. f-strings are the way to go. So for example: \`print('Nice to meet you ' + name + '!')\` becomes \`print(f"Nice to meet you {name}!")\` * \`apples = input('Enter red or yellow (case sensitive): ')\` This can easily be made case insensitive. Strings have lots of methods for that. \`"aBc".lower() == "abc"\`, \`"aBc".upper() == "ABC"\` and \`"aBc".title() == "Abc"\`. * I'd also argue that the name apples isn't a particularly good choice for a variable name - how about \`apple\_colour\` or \`colour\`? * The whole colour thing is essentially mapping an input string to an output string so maybe you might want to use dictionary here to not have as much duplicate code and easier extendability. Since you're a beginner this could be a fun challenge :) * \`str(int(float(number) + 1))\` Why exactly did you do this like that? \`float\` converts the string to a float which you then add 1 to and convert it to int and then to string right away. you don't need the float conversion and the str can also be omitted when using f-strings: \`f"{name} you like {apples} apples, and I gave you {int(number) + 1} of them. Did you eat them? {eat}."\`. Since this is a very long line of text you should break it into multiple lines so that it's somewhat like this: \`\`\` print(f"{name} you like {apples} apples, and I gave you " f"{int(number) + 1} of them. Did you eat them? {eat}.") \`\`\` * And lastly you could look into while-loops to handle the cases where a user enters something else than you expected in a way that doesn't terminate the program, but rather allows him to reenter his information. &amp;#x200B; Hope this didn't come across as sounding too harsh :)
2. Try using something like elif number in (1, ,2, 3) instead of "==" That should work.
`elif number in (1, 2, 3)`
I found this which looks promising: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter18/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter18/) It basically lays out how to use this library: [https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) Seems like a solid start. Would love to hear what you think of pyautogui and whether or not it's a well suited library.
I’m not sure how to attach a screenshot but there’s 8 entries: 1 is: ls -ao 2-7 are: /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python ; exit; 8 is: history I’ve just noticed on system information under network-locations I also have 3 Samsung androids connected with PPP connections. I’ve never once connected anything Samsung to this computer?
Tried decorators, cant control the full transitive closure of deps that way :/
Re: 'elif number == (1,2,3)' not working: The reason it doesn't work is number is an int and (1,2,3) is a tuple. They will never be equal. But, you're on the right track, and Python has a good way to do what you want here. Change it to 'elif number in (1,2,3)' and it will check to see if number == one of the values in the tuple (1,2,3). Other ways exist, as well, such as '1 &lt;= number &lt;= 3', especially useful if you're dealing with floats where number could be anything in that range.
Nice.
Abit of an abstract/out-there solution, but you can script keyboard and mouse input via python to create bots (using something like 'directkeys.py' from [https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5](https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5)) &amp;#x200B; It would depend on whether the boxes/areas you need to click on will be the same locations each time, or whether they are subject to relocating. If they are staying in the same place, you can print-screen and paste into paint in order to get the (x,y) coords on your screen, then just slap them into a script. &amp;#x200B; Any questions message me :)
there you go!!! Awesome and this will likely help me in my endeavors soon &amp;#x200B; so basically you have a clear goal and some direction, I think you can totally pull this off, might wanna start small, see if you can follow their tutorial or even control another program all together before attempting your actual program... &amp;#x200B; btw I did a quick search on the automatetheboringstuff page for "api" and didnt find anything so hopefully this wont be about api, though it is a bit of a long read so yeah im totally looking into it this evening
something I really benifited from was playing with a module for OCR called "tesseract". Photo text extraction if your not firmilar with the term ocr. I'll try to think of a few more
I consider myself a fanatic when it comes to automating. Go check out a program called Eventghost. It's python and will give you the platform to learn managing these things and then you can switch to your own scripts once you learn. EG is like Tasker for Windows.

You can definitely use pandas to read and filter multiple Excel files. Here's [one approach](https://pbpython.com/excel-file-combine.html) I wrote about a while back. Hope it helps.
Thank you for the response. It will be bit before I can start tinkering with a new API, but I'll keep watch on your project and start with yours when I do.
automated to fucking make a person nude. Do you see the difference? It can be used by almost anyone. Blackmailing can become very easy.
Yea but there’s issues with pandas and memory leaks which is why as I go through the process of performs functions n the data set I was only able to write 12 MB in 12 hours.
No it's a forever out on real blackmail. It will be the new fake news.
Nope. Pi doesn't terminate, it's a non-repeating infinite sequence.
I am pretty sure there is already a dedicated computer that is doing this in some lab
Confirm it's also available under IntelliJ too?
I can’t see how those commands would have caused harm. But I can’t claim to be an expert here.

Yes it will work in IntelliJ as long as the Python plugin is installed - only on Python files though.
I added db.relationship to the main table, these are my 3 tables: &amp;#x200B; class AccountCreation(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'account_creation' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) email = db.Column(db.String(75), nullable=False, index=True, unique=True) password = db.Column(db.String(15), nullable=False) creationdate = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False) accountstats = db.relationship('AccountStats') accountstatus = db.relationship('AccountStatus') &amp;#x200B; class AccountStats(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'account_stats' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) rep = db.Column(db.SmallInteger, nullable=False, default=1) player_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('account_creation.id', onupdate='RESTRICT', ondelete='RESTRICT', deferrable='NOT DEFERRABLE', initially='IMMEDIATE'), nullable=False) &amp;#x200B; class AccountStatus(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'account_status' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) last_logged_in = db.Column(db.String, default='') ip_address = db.Column(db.String(25), default='') port = db.Column(db.SmallInteger, default=0) account_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('account_creation.id', onupdate='RESTRICT', ondelete='RESTRICT', deferrable='NOT DEFERRABLE', initially='IMMEDIATE'), nullable=False) &amp;#x200B; Code to add to database: acc = AccountCreation(acctype=t, email=email, password=passwd, creationdate=td) accstats = AccountStats() accstatus = AccountStatus() db.session.add(acc) db.session.commit() db.session.add(accstats) db.session.commit() db.session.add(accstatus) db.session.commit() &amp;#x200B; As I do: print(accstats.player\_id) I get 'None' &amp;#x200B; The commit fails and only the accountcreation table gets commited. Tried following the docs from [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/basic_relationships.html#one-to-many). &amp;#x200B; I'm trying to make it so as I do the following command, the 2 tables are able to appear: SELECT * FROM account_creation INNER JOIN account_stats ON account_creation.id = account_stats.player_id;

It is required for installing, but actually it is not necessary for using. If you think it annoys you, I will remove it in the next version.
Start with python's standard library. There's a lot in there, and being familiar with it will save you from having to solve problems that are already solved for you.
Perhaps you could share the source code? I'd love to prank a friend with this! ~~That and I love looking at source codes~~
they can already do that
So this sends my code to your web service? Sounds too similar to Kite for my taste.
`core.coreClass.main` and `prepare.prepareClass.main` doesn't need to be in classes. Just put them into individual functions. Use a class if you want to have some state that you need to change with more than one function.

Nice, what are you hoping to achieve?
Please tell me that name is a discworld reference
Oh dear! Have just tried it and I don't get the error - which OS are you running?
How well does this work with projects that have heavy dependencies. Such as a Django site, or image editing with Pillow. On your site the most complex example was using the [gilded rose kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/python/gilded_rose.py). Which has no external dependencies and is wholly contained in a single file. Was hoping to see some examples of refactoring using "production code". Something I might see if I were to jump into someone else's project. Have you guys done anything like grabbing a popular python repo (that already has tests written) and just starting running it against random files? Like [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), run it on `youtube_dl/aes.py` and test with `test/test_aes.py`.
So making it easier for them is okay? Why does "they can already do that" discount all the negatives, but none of the positives? Almost like you're shifting goalposts and not arguing in good faith. Checking your post history, it's clear you're never arguing in good faith. Go keep calling people fags for disagreeing.
Not at all. Much appreciated. I used float to avoid getting an error if the user entered a float at the prompt. It would break the program if they did. No errors means a higher grade :)
Only people in marketing use "AI" now. Are you using machine learning here or a system of rules written by humans?
A memory leak when some kind of error causes all your RAM to become filled up Your issue is probably related to your code, because if you are iteratively writing to the same output file but not appending, you are just overwriting everything in the output file which is why it might be 12MB. The reason it might be running after 12 hours also might be due to your code or due to the fact that Pandas can be extremely slow and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. See my example for a much faster way to do what you want
`python -m pip --version` should work
Yeah we know it isn't ideal - this is just the alpha so nothing is set in stone yet. We do intend to have multiple plugins and support multiple languages in the future, so a service-based approach seemed sensible.
Ooh ok :D if you want to prevent wrong user input from breaking your code there are a few ways to do it: * Fancy way: exceptions. Exceptions are the key error handling method in lots of languages and usually consist of try, catch and an optional finally (catch is also optional)(iirc Python also supports else on a try block). But if you're not that deep in the language it may be a bit complicated. Also exceptions are generally a rather slow mechanic * Strings in python have a method named `isdigit` that you can use to test if a string contains a valid positive integer. You can use this to test if the number is valid prior to parsing it. `"123".isdigit() == True`
Swap is nothing more than virtual memory using HD space instead of ram, its like increasing your page file size on windows. Interesting to note that swap partition in Linux is completely unnecessary if you already have enough ram on a 64bit machine. For instance, I just built a lenovo laptop T490 with 40gb of ram so I can write huge data sets to ram in python at maximum speed without dealing with the hard drive until its time to write the final results. This amount of ram makes a swap partition pointless. The laptop comes with 8gb soldered on and I added a 32gb to the free slot. With this much ram there's no point to have swap, you're not going to use up all 40gb. The swap exists for people with skimpy resources who are arriving at Linux's front door with 2-4gb of ram and simply opening 10 browser tabs may blow the doors off and reach 100%.
Ok, so what did you try? Why didn't it work for you?
Use them independently. You can host your Vue app in your Django project, but it is easier to keep them separate and interact via a rest interface such as django rest framework.
I also read yesterday that if you wish to put your system into hibernation you should allocate a swap space greater than or equal to the amount of ram installed into the system. I know that when a system hibernates it saves the system's state to the disk, but 'where' is unknown to me.
Building a machine learning system that takes a bunch of data from users in a mobile marketplace and applies linear regression with XGBoost to get an estimate of when the users will next install an app. I have some concerns about my statistical model - at the time, I'm dividing the week I do have into seven time windows and using the data gathered from day one to fit day two's time of first installation. I'm not fully sure if this is any different from using the data of day one to fit the results of the first day, since I don't have ant data for the final day I'll try to predict, but I'll likely try both models and see what happens.
Factory reset and get your personal data from iCloud. Second step is to never leave you machine unlocked again.
What the hell are you doing that needs 25 GB of RAM at some points, (pls make a post in this dubreddit)
Hibernation mode is specifically a mode that suspends to disk. Everywhere the documentation mentions that you should have a swap size equal to your ram is actually overestimating it for most just to play it safe. If you have &lt; 8gb of ram, go ahead and make a swap equal. But there's no reason for a swap to go beyond that, idle state for most people is 1-4gb of ram used. So figure your what your typical idle state is on day to day use, take that number and add a few gb for good measure, and that's a big enough swap if you need to have one or if you want to use a suspend to disk mode like hibernate
Glad to see you guys are receptive to feedback. I understand the technical advantages of a service-based approach, but you gotta understand that code being shipped to an untrusted third party is going to be an absolute showstopper for any company that values its trade secrets (i.e. all of them).
I'm iterating through lists of literally millions of postal records and making address corrections to them. This process goes from 40 minutes to 20 seconds when you have enough ram to load the whole lists prior to manipulation. If you lack the ram and need to use virtual memory or swap partitions the time it takes to process the same data goes up astronomically. My work desktop has 16gb of ram and it takes about 40 minutes. When I bought my new laptop the same script running the same data dropped to 20 seconds because it never once had to resort to using much slower hard drive storage, it could juggle the entire procedure in the ram.
Vscode online is probably going to fit the bill potentially. Probably won't be free for what you're suggesting though.
Excellent point! We're a small team, and have focused on refactoring the code inside individual functions as a starting point - we'll be iterating and will get to analysing heavy dependencies in time. We have been doing some testing on open source repos, but hadn't looked at youtube-dl yet - thanks for the tip.
You did do this on a virtual machine, right?

That's true of any infinite sequence of random numbers, so not particularly notable in this case.
Seconded for JORS - I published a paper on the python software I wrote via JORS. The editing process was timely, and overall the journal staff that I interacted with were pleasant to work. They kindly waived my publishing fee as my (at the time) advisor in graduate school seemed to continually drop the ball on making the payment. Eventually I had graduated and coordinating the payment was a bit of a pain - the staff understood and waived the fee.

Potentially dumb question as I’m still new and learning Python. I have code which loops a list of about 1,000 IDs through an API to gather historical data for each ID. Will multi-threading make the data pull faster? Currently takes a little over an hour.
Now I wish I had access to these tools! In my personal case, I'm rather bound to the original C. In astrophysics, there's a TON of publicly available code in C that the community uses. In contrast, I've never come across any C++ at work. Head over to particle physicist's office, however, and in my experience you'll find C++ dominating over C.
No.
Does the package rely on using your mouse and keyboard? I thought PyAutoGUI was for automating the use of other people's GUIs as it clicks buttons, etc. If it's busy using the keyboard and mouse, I don't know a way around that without working at the protocol level which may be where you need to be working anyway if you want to run it in the background.

I'm not certain but it may be possible to create a virtual machine and have this pyautogui be done inside there without affecting the main machine. I'm also curious about the answer so I'll be trying this out and letting you know.

For over a year now, I’ve been developing a huge solo project that relies on an open-source circuit simulation program (Ngspice). One of the first things I did was to develop asynchronous (Twisted) code to talk to Ngspice via STDIO, which was a considerable challenge. Ngspice is based on the Berkeley SPICE program developed over thirty years ago, and its user interface is not exactly up to date. Looking through its source code is fascinating and horrifying at the same time; you can see actual GOTO statements and comments written in the 1980s. But Berkeley SPICE is public domain, widely used, and it works. Ngspice does have a C API, and people have interfaced Python stuff to it that way, but I wanted to be entirely free of that level of entanglement with ancient C code. And the good news is, after much head-scratching and unit testing, I never have to pay any attention to the STDIO communication layer anymore. It just works, fast and all the time, entirely hidden to me. As far as Ngspice is concerned, there is someone at the console madly typing in commands and looking at thousands of lines of ASCII-printed results, and it does its thing as designed. Because STDIO is done entirely at the OS (Linux) level with no data being written to disk or any network, there’s really not much of any slowdown, except for some text processing in Python which I’ve heavily optimized. Overall, I’m glad I went that route.
You could use something like AWS Lambda - that way you just write Python code and AWS handles all the HTTP interaction for you. But that also locks you into the Amazon ecosystem, with all the advantages _and_ downsides that gives you.
Do able for sure but a robust solution would require computer vision.
Hey, thanks for the prompt reply! I have looked into AWS Lambda, and the only thing bugging me is the cost. I would rather use something I can deploy on a server of my choice... but lambda looks like the best option currently.
You can look into [Fn Project](https://fnproject.io/), or [Kubeless](https://kubeless.io/), or [Fission](https://fission.io/), or the other, like, 50 serverless-over-k8s things. I'd avoid them until people concentrate efforts, but if you're ideologically opposed to writing Flask _or_ using Amazon, they're probably your best options.

Probably not. Again it's hard to say because your code isn't formatted and might be incomplete. Also this kind of question is better suited for /r/learnpython Have you tried the example I gave you? It should be done in minutes if not seconds and will use very little memory. It's not good practice to use Pandas unless it is absolutely necessary, and for what you're trying to do it's totally unnecessary.

I have not made an api tutorial yet but here is one on using mysql: [http://webyaml.com/docs/tutorials/database/crud](http://webyaml.com/docs/tutorials/database/crud) I was planning on writing a tutorial on creating a RESTful API this weekend. It is pretty trivial to do once you have a data object constructed you can output it as json with a easy function something like this: value: "{{json(your-data-object)}}" it may be best to start here: [http://webyaml.com/docs/gettingstarted/introduction](http://webyaml.com/docs/gettingstarted/introduction) you can add custom python too, look under the "Develop" section for info. Feel free to DM me if you have questions.
Because it's not necessarily a good idea.
I know your comment was 3 months ago, but you should download the "Code Runner" extension for VSCode. It'll do what you're looking for.
It kinda depends on where you're overwhelmed. I'm guessing you're still at, "what is step 1?" But if not, please don't take offense! Just say more about where you're at. The first step is a web-scraping problem. You need to get the information into your programmatic hands. You might start with the Hitchhiker's Guide [page on that](https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/scrape/). One thing that page doesn't mention is the intelligent use of the browser to figure out your HTML on a complex page. I really like using "inspect element" in the browser (it's a little different in Chrome or Firefox - so google it. Maybe YouTube?). This will very quickly get you to the HTML you need to extract. Personally, while I'm figuring out selectors, I like to use javascript in the web console. You can do `document.querySelectorAll('some.selector')` and you'll get a list of the matching elements that's a lot more interactive than if you're working in Python. Once you figure out your selector, it's easy to put it into lxml or whatever HTML parser you want to use, then put your data into python dicts &amp; lists, and you can export individual objects using the json module.
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing; manually going through it and systematically backing up and checking programs. What I’m after more than anything is confirmation or denial that these programs are evidence of tampering or not.
Software you did not install i installed. It has been compromised.

Noooo Chico amigo nooooooo
I haven't done nearly enough Python this week, but did have a look at [PyInquirer](https://pypi.org/project/PyInquirer/) and found it very useful for my various scripts.
Why are you loading the whole list? Can you not read it line by line (or whatever chunking delimiter) with a generator?
Does it run on Hex?
What if you broke the tasks into multiple smaller jobs? IE , wouldn't splitting it into 10 different be 10x as fast
Those commands, do you think that they are remote backups to a Dropbox account?
That’s not too much. A lot of Next Gen Sequencing steps can use way more than that. Initial data from each full run can start around a terabyte (I usually do smaller runs though, &lt;300gb each).
pretty cool, but might wanan try just blocking hosts if you dont want ads
In the immediate term nothing will happen obviously, but the biggest risk is that in the medium to long term security vulnerabilities and package compatibility becomes an issue. FYI ActiveState is planning to do security fixes and continued commercial support for Python 2. More info here: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/activestate-offers-extended-support-for-python-2-beyond-eol-300885345.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/activestate-offers-extended-support-for-python-2-beyond-eol-300885345.html) Disclaimer: I work for ActiveState.
In the terminal what results do you get for: `ls /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python` And `cat /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python`
I don't think that it works like this
We've deployed a fix , though you might have to clear your cache for it to work. If it's still broken please let me know exactly what it's doing and your browser/OS. Yeah we've started with an IntelliJ with Python/Pycharm plugin.

I've been working on my compression software for a few months off and on. It's gotten to the point of being able to replace 7-zip for me, it fully integrates with Windows Registry and I can right click on files/folders and add them to an archive right away. I designed the GUI very similarly to 7-zip and added my own spin on it to make it better, such as a item queue, post-operation commands that are executed, and script-less automation. Basically cherry picking ideas from 7-zip, WinRAR and WinZip and adding my own ideas to a standalone application. I've had a lot of fun with the standard compression libraries gzip, bzip2, zipfile, and tarfile (as well as others such as zstandard).
They probably just don't want the secret sauce getting out.
what doesnt work like that?
So what can we expect for multi file use?
I doubt that you can prevent the spotify ads by blocking hosts
Hello, thank you for your help and time. Currently my bot logs in using selenium. then it expands the whole page by looping through the xpaths. &amp;#x200B; While its looping it checks the xpaths attribute to see if its a button to expand or if the attribute its the one belonging to the links that take you to the spectrum page. &amp;#x200B; if its a button its clicks it and if its a link it opens it in new tab. I understand i might have to re-write this but heres a function from the bot. &amp;#x200B; should i put the spectrums in a string or array? can i have an example of what an object would look like if you did it? thanks. &amp;#x200B; `def expand_page(self):` `req = driver.get("https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/index/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/Antibiotics")` `time.sleep(randint(2, 4))` `while True:` `try:` `leafs = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("index-leaf")` `buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("index-expand")` `rangeNum = len(leafs) + len(buttons) + 1` `for index in range (1, rangeNum):` `xpath = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id='firstul']/li[{}]/a".format(index))` `role = xpath.get_attribute('role')` `attribute = xpath.get_attribute('class')` `if role == 'button':` `xpath.click()` `time.sleep(3)` `elif attribute == 'flush':` `xpath.send_keys(Keys.COMMAND + Keys.RETURN)` `time.sleep(3)` `else:` `print("ERROR!!")` `return` `except ValueError:` `print("ERROR")`
If you can't use your system, it's dangerous.
The above repository contains hacks and reverse engineering for the old commercial/freeware version, it doesn't contain the actual deepnude software, but seems otherwise legit enough. For the source code, this mirror here is legit: https://github.com/stacklikemind/deepnude_official It is however incomplete, as it is missing the trained model which you need to actually use the software. The original developer wanted to add it later, but that didn't happen before the repository got closed. You can copy it over from the commercial/freeware version presumably, but I haven't tried that.
Spotify
that fixed it, thank you.
You can print it for any practical purpose to do with circles and round object. At some times you reach so small units that quantum effects matters more than the precision of pi. I have no idea how many digits goes into the difference between the circumference of the universe, and the scale of quantum effects.
well i did it for two years before buying premium, feel free to try it for yourself all the adds just come from thirs party ip's that you can easily block
you're getting Permission Denied errors. did you try it with --user or sudo?
Not with that attitude
For the sake of not keeping open database file its safer in python to immediately load the whole index file into a pythonic list and immediately close the related database file once its been indexed into python. This happens for multiple database files which need checked against each other to create a new 4th file. There's a lot of gymnastics that happen between the lists to create the 4th and plenty of iterations through them, but step one is tossing the relevant files into a virtual python list so I can safely run my algorithms without corrupting the originals. Keep in mind, these are already the broken down lists. They aren't the mega list.
Can you get an event trigger that only checks on list update rather than at intervals?
At the moment it scans whichever files you open and checks if it can suggest anything for each function (or the whole file if it's a script),
List update happens at interval. Unfortunately, I do not know how to do it differently at the momenrlt. Once I know more I'll get back to this application.
Wow, you are right. I stand corrected. I would have never thought that they would be stupid enough to send the ads from a different server. This is indeed an invitation to block these hosts. Forgive me my lack of knowledge and have a nice day.
You can simplify things a bit to reduce repetition: ``` ad_running = [t for t in titles if t == "Advertisement" or t == "Spotify"] mute = 1 if ad_running else 0 for session in AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions(): session.SimpleAudioVolume.SetMute(mute, None) ```
Actually, why not just decide if you should mute or not inside `foreach_window` by looking at the titles rather than storing them all. That way you don't have to loop the whole list 2x. That would be a lot faster.
Make an iterator and write to disk/flush buffer every X integers. You dont need more RAM.
I’ve updated the code to show more work on it
I got a subscription because they said they were going to crack down on people using ad blockers...
Honestly Im stuck..... I want to build a slackbot with python and I have all this info but have no clue where to start...... Should I start on github and compile code, or start with slack and research bots with slack
lol np, enjoy your day too
haha i mean every company says that every month, tbh a subscription is nice anyway cause you can use a lot of the better features such as downloading and discord integration. I just couldn't really afford it before, so i would just block hosts cause i hate ads
Something speaking against using Flask for a REST API?
Race condition.
If you don't want to pay for listening to music that people have worked to create, then you're played ads to generate some revenue. Spotify is very reasonably priced. You can even get student/family subs if I remember right. Am I the only one that finds this an unethical use of our skills?
The ads are still being played. The only loser in this situation is the person who payed for the ad, and that knowledge people pay for to share is something I removed.
Thanks!
You could always just pay for it so the artists get some change.
Like walking away from the TV when commericals come on
It’s no different than ignoring the ad like usual. S/he’s just turning the volume down is all
Here's my take, I did not check if it works: import ctypes import time from pycaw.pycaw import AudioUtilities EnumWindows = ctypes.windll.user32.EnumWindows EnumWindowsProc = ctypes.WINFUNCTYPE(ctypes.c_bool, ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int), ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int)) GetWindowText = ctypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextW GetWindowTextLength = ctypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextLengthW IsWindowVisible = ctypes.windll.user32.IsWindowVisible def check_window(window, _): if not IsWindowVisible(window): return should_mute = get_window_title(window) in ("Advertisement", "Spotify") set_mute(should_mute) def get_window_title(window): length = GetWindowTextLength(window) buffer = ctypes.create_unicode_buffer(length + 1) GetWindowText(window, buffer, length + 1) return buffer.value def set_mute(value): for session in AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions(): session.SimpleAudioVolume.SetMute(1 if value else 0, None) if __name__ == "__main__": while True: time.sleep(5) EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc(check_window), 0) You can see how all the logic is split up into smaller functions. Also there's not mutation of the `titles` variable. And all the different windll functions are defined only once at the top. But anyway, pay for the god damn subscription!
this used to work in skype as well, wouldn't be surprised if it still does but I haven't used skype in ages
You could write the backwards pi in the following manner : ...95141.3
Oh yeah, it won't work cause it will just unmute on the next window, hah. But I think you get the idea how it can be refactored :)
OK - I see what's going on - it's paywalled, so a solution like selenium can be really nice there. &amp;#x200B; That said, I'm not sure you need to go through all the UI to expand and click everything... I suspect you can just query those elements directly. Since you're using Xpath, you can go ahead and get the links directly. Is the trouble now getting the contents of the page? Keeping the hierarchy of the UI that you expand to click on the page?
Memory is going to the console log. Whenever you print() something, it goes to the console log which builds up as you print more things.
`{{ url_for('static', filename=image_url) }}` and put your image in your [static files path](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/tutorial/static/).
Does it also backup just in case you really do a dumb dumb? `nuke ohshit`
Put a bunch of monkeys randomly poking at letters on a keyboard for eternity and somewhere within they'll produce every work of Shakespeare and everything ever written. Basic infinite money theorem. Produce random numbers to infinity and somewhere within you'll have any sequence of numbers you can imagine. That's just the nature of combining randomness and infinity.
Blocking "spclient.wg.spotify.com" in hosts no longer works in Windows; it blocks ads, but eventually you can no longer load songs. What are you blocking to kill the ads?
If you want to do it pan OS or a bit quicker, I open-sourced a library to get the currently playing song from Spotify by reading the title off the app window. Similar to what you're doing but it will look a bit cleaner. https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify
Have a few more ideas around Spotify. Thanks, will definetely use!
Solid, does your script mute the audio just for the Spotify app when the ad is playing or for the whole system?
For the whole system, but had it for one application before. Worked with others, but couldn't get it to work around spotify.
indeed the remedy is printed in the message...: &gt;Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: \[Errno 13\] Permission denied: '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi-2019.6.16.dist-info' Consider using the \`--user\` option or check the permissions.
im not sure i understand your question. When i query the links it does not act like a click. it takes me to a minimized page. Therefore i must simulate clicks with selenium. So yeah keeping the hierarchy of the UI becomes a problem if not using selenium, and just sending queries. im just wondering what is the best way to organize this. Should i scrape the text and do something like... { "antibiotics": { "aminoglycosides": {"Amikacin": "SPECTRUM STRING OR ARRAY"}, {"Gentamicin": "SPECTRUM STRING OR ARRAY", {"Kanamycin": "SPECTRUM STRING OR ARRAY"}}, like objects for the antibiotics and arrays or strings for spectrums? I'm sorry if i sound confusing i don't have of experience programming. But i greatly appreciate your time and help. blessings.
I'm 100% confident Kenneth will make sure they're all in good hands. He understands their importance to the community as a whole.
Do you know EZBlocker? Coded in dotnet with the same idea and also working with the Windows App and tray mode: https://github.com/MatrixDJ96/EZBlocker2

EZBlocker2 will do this, modifies the hosts file to get the majority of them and has a feature for removing banner ads too afaik.
Initially, I automated a decent chunk of my job using PyAutoGUI, but ran into this same issue. I couldn't do anything while it was running as it has control of mouse and keyboard. I eventually discovered Selenium for web scraping and Django to make a controllable webGUI and I've been good ever since.
I'm converting python 2 to 3
Download the openpyxl module. You can literally search for specific cells, specific names, etc and it is pretty easy to manipulate excel with.
You'd be surprised. It's not just Spotify but most of these services where you can easily identify ads by their IPs. As far as why they don't use the same IP as that of their service, most of the time there are some physical constraints. Example they of course mostly use third party ad services to push ads because most companies wouldn't want to branch out to a whole new department of selling ad spaces and then showing those ads to users. And secondly, there are physical constraints. These apps have a lot of user traffic and in order to offer low latency they want to keep their servers trimmed down (that's a very simplified way of saying it), putting the ad service on the same cluster could negatively affect their response time which is vital for user experience. Disclaimer: all this is just my best guess, I'm no expert on this topic.
Is the problem you encounter frequently an unwillingness to learn how to properly use hit?
Nice! I am new to python and I am also sick and tired of these ads. Lately I’ve been using Spotdl https://pypi.org/project/spotdl/ and downloading the songs from Spotify in order to avoid ads. Maybe instead of muting during ads, you could bridge those ads by downloading the next song locally and playing it while waiting for ads to be over? That way you would not have silence. Nice work though!
Oof, you really should go to /r/learnpython. 1) Make a thread in /r/learnpython 2) Post the entirety of your code and any error messages. You put part of your code here in a code block, but it doesn't at all make sense. Obviously, it doesn't work (blatant syntax error), so please don't tell me it works. Aside from the syntax error, it just doesn't make sense (it looks like your function is recursive, but why???). Post it all in a single code block - if you have something working, great, just make sure that we can see it all. It's still impossible to tell exactly what is going on. Moreover, I've given you a working solution to your issue, so I would implore you to try that. If you don't understand some particular aspect of my solution, try and figure it out on your own and as a last resort ask about it on Reddit
Something to think off .. thanks!
As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, muting won't stop the ads from playing. The artists will still get paid. Though yeah it would become a problem if lots and lots of people started doing it in which case the ad clients would realize that buying ads on Spotify doesn't help their marketing and they'd stop buying ads or the prices would lower, thus decreasing the artist revenue.
What did you use for the first project?
This is a pretty cool idea! It would be nice if it would look for a `.nukeignore` within the current working directory as well. More documentation about the behavior of `.nukeignore` files within subdirectories would be nice too. The documentation in general could be more explicit. For example, the fact that empty subdirectories will be removed while subdirectories with ignored files or a `.nukeignore` will be preserved. Also the fact that the top level directory will never be removed. `nuke -l` does not reflect the above behavior either. For example, say I have the following directory tree: test └── subdir └── .nukeignore If I run `nuke -l test`, I see this: test/ subdir/ If I run `nuke test`, nothing happens. If I remove the `.nukeignore` from `subdir`, then `nuke -l test` has the exact same output as before, yet now when I run `nuke test`, `subdir` is removed. I would avoid using the verb "nuke" in your documentation unless you are talking about the action of running `nuke` on a directory. As it is, running `nuke -h` says that the command will "Nuke the DIRECTORY specified" and then it says that the `-l` option will "List all the files that will be nuked". As I mentioned above, the actual top level directory that is nuked is not removed, but when you say a file is nuked you do mean that it is removed. You say that `.nukeignore` is "similar to the `.gitignore` file." How similar is it? Do the `*`, `!`, `?`, `[`, and `]` characters work the same way as they do in `.gitignore`? Does `**` work? In summary, I like this idea and it seems like a pretty good implementation so far, but I will be wary to use the tool until it is more fully documented and mature.
I'm using a pi-hole for my home network. For a long time I could block all ads on google services because they came from a different server. This doesn't work anymore because now the ads come from hosts with important services. I just assumed everyone would do it this way now. The amount of users blocking the ads obviously isn't big enough for them to care.
Great work OP
Pretty good idea! I can see this being particularly useful for me when cleaning up directories I've made for video or photography projects...
Thanks, might be interested of trying of that after being subscriber for 5+ years. Why? Because premium has introduced ads ...
That was it, thank you!
check out the .loc(), .iloc() data frame methods. Also useful are apply() and map() depending what you want to do.
Currently I'm developing a software for solve systems of non linear equations
Is there a command to clear the console log periodically while the program is still executing?

Sorry for noob question but how do I identify different hosts to block?
Just buy the damn spotify and support the artists you love.
Oh I see. Things like pi-hole were one of the things I had in my mind when writing out the previous comment. I didn't know companies are now countering it in this way.
I haven't looked into it but something like this might be cool to add to an existing i3 status bar script for spotify mute the audio and change the status to [muted advertisement] or something in the i3 status bar
Was about to say the same. openpyxl is the best excel module I have used.
I pay and have no ads, that’s written in the conditions. Plus the offline feature is a must-have for any traveler.
Same in bash. Not by me but works fine on linux (personally tested on arch, manjaro &amp; opensuse) [https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller)
Why not send a fast forward command? ... I was about to go on about how I do this in Linux... but this is Windows so idk.
This is also the case with YouTube, a nice /etc/hosts file will block most ads.
Interesting to see this [in the context](https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/) of some of the recent writing on him and requests. Hopefully things work out well for all involved, and hopefully requests ends up in very good hands.

The "better way" is to pass it into your function.
No, because "Logger" only exists during the execution of "\_\_init\_\_". You cannot reach that variable from anywhere else in your code. Might I suggest you check out /r/learnpython?

There is a pattern "Singleton" for when any piece of code may need to access an object, and they will all access the same one. An example is the one logging stream that all modules should add messages to. A simple implentation is a variable in an external module that every module imports. More common is to import a function that returns the one and only instance.

No problem
There's definitely posts on Adafruit - I was looking at some a few days ago. It looked like combined temp/humidity sensors were pretty cheap.
And if you haven't already, you can get rid of the broken entry in your photo.
You sound like you are actually pretty good at figuring out details and are struggling with how to structure the overall project. Which is fine! That said, I'm not sure what a "minimized page" is - but you seem to be getting what you need, so let's not worry about it for now. I think one suggestion would be to break the problem down into smaller pieces that you can clearly finish - each of these could be a separate script, or combined if you like: 1. Get the raw HTML file from each antibiotic, save those hierarchically in a way that mirrors the hierarchy. So, save the files like antibiotics/aminoglycosides/Amikacin.html 2. Extract the tables from these files. It's kind of a pain in the butt, but if you're doing OK with Xpath, I think you should be able to do it. The tables are annoying - with colspan rows for the various sections in each table, so you can't just parse them with pandas (which would be easy). 3. For each table, iterate over the rows in a for loop and convert it to a reasonable data structure. What's a reasonable data structure for the spectrum? I think something like a dict: ``` {'Aerobic gram-positive bacilli': [['Arcanobacterium (haemolyticum)', '2nd line'], ['etc.', 'etc.']], 'Aerobic gram-positive cocci': [ ... ]} ``` Or of you don't need those categories, just discard them and make a list of lists. Anyway, hope that helps. I think I've exhausted my random help time for the day, but I'm curious to hear how you go!
Why not just learn to be more careful? Or make backups? Or (in the case of small textual files) use source control? You are attempting to reinvent the wheel where the wheel is basic unix usage and common sense.

I would say you go to much in the decarators thing, probably by just discovering decorators. I would say that a lot of this uses case can probably being replaced either by a function which call your core function or a function which takes your core function as a parameter and call it. The fact that you don't really know what happen, is certainly you use it too much like a magic thing.
My favorite module change is `math`: &gt; Added new function math.dist() for computing Euclidean distance between two points. &gt; Added new function, math.prod(), as analogous function to sum() that returns the product of a ‘start’ value (default: 1) times an iterable of numbers. &gt; Added new function math.isqrt() for computing integer square roots.

It's very unfortunate the community drove out Guido over assignment expressions.
It seems that starlette is only required if you want to run the example...? If it were my project, I would therefore make it an optional dependency which os not installed by default. Having unnecessary dependencies in a project becomes a particularly noticeable problem when deploying packages to "serverless" environments such as AWS Lambda, which have limits on package sizes.

Just wrote my first script that reads a .csv log and outputs rows based on a string. Took 4 hours but idc I’m excited about it.
Why would you need to do this???
If you tell us what is the Python replacement for `pins` and `AnalogPin`. This looks like a microcontroller script. Also, Python is not JavaScript, so you won't be able to change DOM elements on the web browser side (or whatever is used to display the HTML and run JS). This means no fiddling with `input`.
Publish it on GitHub/GitLab/Whatever and post the link here. More people should respond.
For completeness: use the requests library to access the POST data as a dictionary, retrieve the "Authorization" key, then use the method mentioned by the other reply to get the sub-string after "Basic &lt;base64 string&gt;". &amp;#x200B; The reason you don't need to use a regular expression is the data you want is already in an easily parsed format, and that using regular expression matching is slower.

Awesome, I'm glad you got it working! I didn't do a great job explaining what I meant earlier, although what you've done here works just as well. The SQLAlchemy ORM can allow you to assign model instances to other model instances, if you have defined how they're related to one another using the `relationship` function. For example, I could do: class Post(db.Model): id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) title = db.Column(db.String) class Comment(db.Model): id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("post.id")) message = db.Column(db.String) db.relationship(Post, backref=db.backref("comments")) # Here I'll create a post and a comment, but they aren't yet related. post = Post(title="DB Relationships Explained") comment = Comment(message="Nice post!") # Here I might try: comment.post_id = post.id, but that won't work # because post.id is None at this point, *but* I can do the following. comment.post = post # I can also do the following because of the backref: post.comments.append(comment) # Here, if I added the comment to the "comments" list, I can just add # post to the session, and comment should be committed as well. db.session.add(post) db.session.commit() For further/better info, take a look at [the docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/basic_relationships.html#basic-relationship-patterns).

I don't know this scanner, but if it pushes codes through RS232, try pyserial module for reading data. The database, though, it depends. For small amount of records, flat file should be enough. If you want to search it quickly (for example by date), SQLite is great. For larger amounts you can use a SQL or NoSQL server. It's impossible to tell without knowing the project. It's your job to choose what you need. Displaying information can be done on the terminal (nothing fancy needed) or through a serial port... again, not enough information.
Thank you!

Refactoring my entire hockey twitter bot that tracks game events in real time and sends them social media instances.

uBlock Origin works if you are on browser
That error means the library does not have the full chain of CA certificates used to sign googleapis.com certificate. Usually there's a function or method you can call to point the library to a PEM file or directory where those certificates are located. You can use system store for that. On Linux it is somewhere in /etc... /etc/ssl/certs for example (depends on the distribution). I have no idea where it can be on Windows and MacOSX. If you want to prepare a PEM file, just take the googleapis.com certificate and go up the chain by AuthorityKeyIdentifier. Find certificates with SubjectKeyIdentifier matching each AKI and save them in separate PEM files or concatenate everything in one.

While csv's are totally fine for a small project, I would still skip them and instead house your data in a database. PostgreSQL is supported by both Flask and Django. This way, you can incorporate more details about your movies such as a short synopsis, cast, etc in different columns.
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but this shit is getting too complicated. Yeah, walrus operators are awesome for the 2% of power users for whom it will save time. For the rest of us it makes the code more abstract and difficult to read. Almost Perl like. I already see this with ridiculous comprehensions.

Thank you! I'd love any feedback.
I am not sure I understand your comment. I use git for everything and I am very proficient with it, but sometimes I need to delete whole directories (such as cmake build directories) and I though having a "better" \`rm -rf \*\` would be nice.
+1000. I really don't understand: the use cases are fairly uncommon IMHO but complexity of the language keeps growing. I'd have understood if they just declared assignment to be an expression.. (as it is in many languages), but new syntax???
I agree but I figured that we live in an age where we can be smarter about deleting stuff. Maybe for more experienced folks my tool is useless, but I can imagine a small subset of the community valuing such a tool (hopefully!).
Haha unfortunately no. Though it would be cool to have something like git's staging where it can revert stuff if you do `nuke ohshit`. I am not sure how that would work though.
Thank you so much for the feedback! Really helpful comments there. :) The code does look for `.nukeignore` files in every directory recursively. When I say `nuke`, I mean deleting all the contents of the directory so there is definite room for improvement in the docs. I see what you mean by `nuke -l` not showing the `.nukeignore` file in the dirtree. That can be confusing and misleading. `nuke` intentionally does not delete subdirectories with `.nukeignore` files since it tries to preserve the `.nukeignore` files throughout the directory hierarchy (otherwise the whole thing would be flawed right?). I'll definitely update the code to print the `.nukeignore` files when listing. My goal was to make it work exactly like a .gitignore but I couldn't find a specification for gitignore, so I mostly tried things out and implemented them. `**` is supported but I don't think the whole range of operations is supported, especially since I don't have tests for them. The whole project is TDD'd so if a test doesn't exist, it definitely doesn't have that functionality. I'll see if I can implement the full spec of .gitignore in this library. Maybe another library for this might be a good idea? Again, thank you for the feedback!

One of the benefits of using a virtualenv is that any files you install are in a place you control (so no "Permission denied") and they are automatically made available to python.
Imageio is a lot easier to make an animation from images than matplotlib.

Wow an answer straight from the python docs and it got downvoted. Strange.
How does one go about this?
You can't really do that with Python. The only way to block ads inside mobile apps is to mess with their network connectivity. Apps that do that usually achieve what they want by pretending to be a VPN and then dropping connections to known advertising servers, but that's not really reliable, and requires some pretty deep integration with the host OS, so you're better off writing it in the native language for your platform.
Dude, this is lit. But I would recommend something like Pi-Hole for universal block, not just specific apps and case like this. Imagine they just drop the text "Advertise" someday.

Very interesting. Just a thought. Is it possible to make the sound on/off transition smoother, not just snapping to on and off?
I think that given the fact that they added assignment expressions, it's good that there's special syntax for it. Particularly for people not used to this type of thing in C, you need some kind of visual cue to tell them "there's some things you haven't seen before going down here and you need to be careful". But yeah, I don't think the benefits outweigh the costs.

To solve the problem of ads you have to pay. And you are not paying. In your analysis you are not accounting for the mixing revenue from people who won't pay because they can just use your script. Spotify is a very ethical company whose revenue is based on paying customers, not ads, not selling data. This kills the good internet.

Congrats, maybe some additional info about things about to be nuked could be added. I would say that the number of files to be deleted and maybe the top five most frequent extensions could give a good feedback to detect some mistake. by thinking about my usage of rm -rf, which is on a personal computer that I reboot enough often that /tmp is cleanup often enough is that rm -rf could be perfectly replaced my a `mv mydir /tmp` with undo possibility. I have to think about it.
Literally nothing special. Just standard library. * Take user input for the project details (name, description, license etc.). * Create the folders and files and automatically fill the details into the files. The file contents are fetched from pre-made templates and I use placeholders to replace some information. Just automating the process. Because I'm using templates for the files I can also make sure they look consistent with other projects.
We have 6000 units at my work. Each has a web accessible site where I can get data about the device. I built a webscraper with selenium to gather all the info I need. Even added multi threading so I have 4 browsers going at once pulling from a pool of devices. It's good shit.
Try check settings of this editor and if you not found correct property just choose another text editor , there are lots of editors on Win10 , and no some colossal different.

As others said, there are other ways to get the result. When using regex, I find [this site](https://regex101.com/) very helpful (make sure to choose the Python flavor).

Sounds like you need to try Dask - does lazy computation on lists/arrays/dataframes so the whole thing is parallelized and chunked automatically. However as you say 32GB is nothing nowadays, I regularly use 128GB for some tasks.
Seems odd that he would have that much problems finding a job.
Check out [hug](http://www.hug.rest/website/quickstart).
Am I crazy, or does he have neither a resume, LinkedIn, nor contact info on his website -- but he's looking for employment?
Awesome 👌💯, had similar problem challenge at my place but solved it with Peer2Peer Networking
I'll try to remember when I get to work!
I was wondering how the author or Requests could be 'looking' for a job... jobs would probably be looking for him... but then I read this piece https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/ Seems like his best has been behind him for some time. Maybe getting back to creating things rather than managing or monetizing them will benefit him more.
Good shit 👌💯
&gt; I'll definitely update the code to print the .nukeignore files when listing. I don't think this is the right behavior, because `nuke -l` is supposed to list what will be deleted and `.nukeignore` will not be deleted. The issue is that it prints directories that contain only a `.nukeignore` or files that will be excluded, when those directories will not be deleted. I think I would prefer `nuke -l` to simply output the relative paths of everything that will be deleted, without any indentation. This removes ambiguity, and would let the output be piped to other tools like grep more easily. For example, take this file structure, where `to_nuke/ignore_py/.nukeignore` contains `*.py`: to_nuke ├── contains_txt │ └── file.txt ├── ignore_py │ ├── .nukeignore │ ├── file.py │ └── file.txt └── only_ignore └── .nukeignore Currently, `nuke -l to_nuke` has the following output: to_nuke/ only_ignore/ ignore_py/ file.txt contains_txt/ file.txt If it listed the path of each individual item that will be deleted, the output would be this: to_nuke/ignore_py/file.txt to_nuke/contains_txt/ to_nuke/contains_txt/file.txt That is unambiguous, and each line is useful on its own. &gt; I couldn't find a specification for gitignore Here it is: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore You'll need to do a little more to replicate the behavior precisely. I ran into an issue: if a `.nukeignore` contains a blank line, it ends up being a pattern that matches anything. In a `.gitignore`, blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
I have been looking forward to the walrus operator (the infamous assignment expression := ).
Do you at least bring your own spoon for others to feed you with?

Yummy spoons.
Wow!!!!
I am newish to python and still try to figure most of the stuff but atm I am working with meraki APIs to get some usefull information out of the dashboard and automate a few config task.
You should be able to move everything from EnumWindows = ... to the end of the IsWindowVisible = line outside of the whie loop. You could also consider moving the def foreach_window outside of the loop as well as long as you keep the re-init of titles each loop. There's no reason to re-execute these basic setup steps (although doing it once every 5 seconds is probably not actually a big deal either). You can also simplify the muting to be 'if "Advertisement" in titles or "Spotify" in titles:' and get rid of the duplicated mute logic. I'm not sure if clearing the mute has any side effects or significant costs to it, but you could track whether you've muted or not, and only do the session scan and un-mute if you have muted already.
I think that Python has "jumped the shark". Walrus operator? Preventing positional arguments in functions with "/"?, etc... just what we all needed. What's the point? Python essentially the slowest programming language, has a very weak, overly complex concurrency story, incoherent packaging story (easy_install, eggs, wheels, pip, etc...) and distributing your application is a pain (install version x of python and all these packages to run your app..) and they are busy turning Python into Perl with these new anti-features??? Good thing the community has their priorities straight /s. No wonder so many developers have moved on to other langs like Go. Good thing that the data science folks are bolstering the community size at the moment or it would be in decline. I care about Python so this situation is upsetting.
Haven't heard about selenium before, but now I know it's a library for brute forcing 😂

I am a chemical engineer. I used Python for a lot of my masters course, using it to simulate a bioreactor and design unit operations (I made a long script to design heat exchangers rather effectively). I am entering the R&amp;D catalytic industry in September and I assume there will be plenty of opportunities to apply it there.
At first I was going to just send http requests but it wasnt possible since it had csrf tokens. The website also had modal after modal so this worked out great. I honestly wished I had 200 more giftcards to have made it even more worth it haha.
This is for Microbit, so value = pins.analogReadPin(analogPin.P0) is Value = Pin0.Read_Analog() The error i get when i convert is python sees Highest = Value as a syntax error
Yayy, you automated the boring stuff with Python!
easy &amp;#x200B; import threads for i in range(cores): threads.do\_stuff()
Good work. This will come in handy for cleaning up build artefacts etc, preserving some good stuff. Good tool for CI indeed.
Ahh i see thank you
does anyone know if PEP 582 is coming in this release ? that was the coolest part of the whole thing for me. the pep mentions 3.8 as a target, but the release notes dont mention 582
5 minutes * 100 gift cards = 500 min = 8 hrs and 20 min It's way more than 2 hours. I love this kind of use of programming.
That's exactly what I've been looking for, just tried it and it runs like clockwork! Thanks, mate!
Hopefully they all find decent homes. The scramble of to claim ownership because "it looks fun" doesn't bode well for some of them being maintained long-term. Some organisation like PSF or Encode taking the majority would be best, imo.
I don’t know. Most C-Like languages allow you to assign in expressions. It’s something people expect. Python stops you using the regular assignment operator because it could easily be a mistake and cause issues which are hard to spot. By introducing the operator we have some clear, unambiguous way to do something people are often used to doing. Am I going to adopt it? Probably not, or at least not for a while. But is it Pythonic? I think so. There’s one clear way of doing something.
This looks very similar to [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit), what makes Dlint different?
I mean it's not ransomware, if this was a virus that just executed itself on startup then you can plug the drive into another computer (safely sequestering it from your own main drive obv), and delete the file(s). Ransomware will encrypt your drive, making it completely useless even if removed and examined by another computer. Additionally, the title of the post isn't "this is a virus written in python", it's "Memes Trojan python edition". First, this is obviously a prank script imitating an old school trojan, and second if it doesn't damage your system but just messes with resolution/window sizes+locs/etc., then it *literally* doesn't damage your computer.
Django would be overkill but with flask or bottle (even simpler) you can do that in just a few lines without much knowledge about HTTP as a protocol.
The "/" doesn't prevent positional arguments, it enforces them. Not something I'll use, but the rationale for adding it seems reasonable: wrapping languages that don't have keyword args and so library maintainers don't get stuck with argument names that would require breaking changes to amend.
It sends your code to their servers, where they analyze it somehow. They they, that code is safe there and they will not resell it or smth, but who knows?
They did an update, now it is running locally on users pc, no more servers
I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I got the root certs from [https://pki.goog/](https://pki.goog/) which I hope is the right ones and not some shady shit. I copied them to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/gd\_intermediate.crt and ran `sudo update-ca-certificates` But it didn't fix the error!
Do you kmow the difference between this threading.Thread and using thr multiprocessing module?
Seeking this post after a Python Jobs AD makes me a little woried.
The problem is that I have some variables (that don't start with '\_') before. How could I make to start printing variables at one point?
These things always go so great until some edge case kills it 7589 runs into a 50000 run data set and you realise you forgot to record which ones it's done already. Speaking from painful experience, design your script to gracefully fail and recover where it left off on a future run should anything unexpected happen.
How do you (learn to) do that?
Python has a thing called the "GIL" (global interpreter lock). It's a feature (or limitation) of how Python works under the hood, and it basically means only one thread in a single python process can be running the interpreter at any one time. If you're doing something where IO or network requests take the majority of the time then this is fine, but if you're doing CPU heavy work and want to utilize all the cores of your CPU, the GIL is a big drawback. Enter the multiprocessing module, which works by literally spawning multiple Python processes. This allows multiple Python interpreters to run at once and to utilize more of the CPU - however, sharing data becomes more difficult/costly as the processes can't share memory as easily. There's a great page here about the GIL: https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock
&gt; Roadside find is now a Linux machine! I hadn't heard of this one. Thats kind of interesting. So it uses the system python interpreter but prioritizes packages in a __pypackages__ directory over system?
I don’t think he has a problem, he has the luxury of waiting for the job that matches exactly what he wants.

You get better at it with experience, but the gist of it is to treat your loop that will run for every item with heavy suspicion. Assume every line of code will fail and every function call will return something unexpected. Detect and handle exceptions gracefully to control the way the script shuts down. Save the state of the app after every successful iteration of the loop (not after the loop), and restore that state on script startup, for example you could append to a plain text file whenever you process an item with the item name, and check if that item has been processed already (looking in the file) before processing it, otherwise skip it. If you're dealing with web requests, you should also expect these to fail intermittently, so build in some retrying and graceful failure/sleeps in sensible places. It can also help to run some tests before the script runs, for example ensuring a website is up and serving content in the format your script expects. Also work with test data and preview only as much as possible during development of the script. If the script is going to be running a lot, you can do fancy things like make it send email reports, tweet, or give it a web interface. It varies with every script, but you'll get better at figuring out what is likely to break and what isn't over time.
PythonAnywhere dev here. You could just host it on our site using our static files system -- more information about that here: [https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/StaticFiles](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/StaticFiles)
I just got that course too. As long as we're talking about the same one. I'm really liking it, but actually thinking about using it to supplement the mitx course 6.00.1.
You never listen to music on your pc?
That's still super cool. I just started learning python, and I'm just a general novice in programming, so I still can't do anything like that.
Try learning git! it's really easy and very convenient in connection with github. This site explains the few basic commands in a very easy way https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
Ported my dblayer to oracle so I can write almost identical pseudo sql in mssql and oracle with timezone and timesnap support: import bptools.oracle db = bptools.mssql(name='test1oracle') res = db.psql(sql="select personid, created, updated from person where updated&gt;=? and updated&lt;=?" values=['now@d#Europe/Oslo', 'now-1w@d#Europe/Oslo']) 20190718103647.643 - bptools.oracle:284 - INFO - select personid, created, updated from person where updated&gt;=TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ('2019-07-18 00:00:00+02:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS TZR') and updated&lt;=TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ('2019-07-11 00:00:00+02:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS TZR') import bptools.mssql db = bptools.mssql(name='test1mssql') res = db.psql(sql="select personid, created, updated from person where updated&gt;=? and updated&lt;=?" values=['now@d#Europe/Oslo', 'now-1w@d#Europe/Oslo']) 20190718103648.911 - bptools.mssql:349 - INFO - select personid, created, updated from person where updated&gt;='2019-07-16 22:00:00.0000000' and updated&lt;='2019-07-10 22:00:00.000000'
How's this? Highest = 0 value = 0 while ( True ): value = Pin0.Read_Analog() if value &gt; Highest: Highest = value Indentations are important. If you typed your Python code just like that JS, I suspect the problematic line may be unindented, which is a syntax error.
Making something that tracks movement and sending an imagine when something is moving (and marking the moving object ) The program itself is done Only problem is that I don’t know how to send the image I need something that can hold pictures on the internet so I don’t waste space on it in my computer
Yes, it is, but if it's, starting at data analysis those party can be at least 16 h for each. But I will not look in this way, more than you will go trough basic of all this topics, if you have berver work with python, this course is fine.
Where did you learn how to do that?
If you are not familiar with Plotly.py, it's an open-source, interactive graphing library for Python.

There's a lot of different distances other than euclidean. Euclidean stops being useful for higher-dimensional spaces (i.e. most data that isn't supposed to represent real life 3d space)
What is selenium?
Also I do not have much interest in collaborations, most of my code is written for my blog posts and then I update the post and the code as I learn more. In other words I am not ready for GitHub yet to be honest. I can see some of the benefits for the future there and will most likely come on board properly sooner or later. Python is just a hobby for me, I have no intention of being a proper dev, more a blog writer. When I put my Bletchley game on there I immediately got forked and then I had a collaboration with a brilliant guy, but because I am so far behind a dev I was totally lost and embarrassed myself. ;-) But the project got done, it took a week or so. In that time I had no time spare to write posts for my blog, which is my main purpose. Thanks for your advice though, I do not take it lightly. I have read that GitHub guide already.
Easily a 40 min task for one person done in 2 hours by two! Thanks Javascript!
Yeah, there are ways. In Linux you can create a virtual display, or "head", but it's tricky. I would instead suggest that you run a virtual machine, if at all possible.
This is a great point, and something to definitely learn/make mistakes on in a simple application first. I've done scraping in the past that was short, but something like: results = [] for whatever in stuff_to_scrape: results.append(grab_and_process(whatever)) then it fails, then I run it again without thinking, then the facepalm. Now the results object is initialized elsewhere (a database, perhaps) and no more troubles. Separations of concerns and all that!
I share your feeling that python should go easy on adding new language features, but you are wrong in many points: - the walrus operator really helps in some rare cases, but I agree that its uses are too rare to justify the mental load for newbies. - the / makes sense: python always had (c implemented) functions that are positional-only, so it makes sense to expose that on the python level. - python has a very allow interpreter, but numba, numpy, and asyncio fix its speed and concurrency problems - packaging is ok these days. just use flit or poetry. Using `pip freeze` you can easily create a file to distribute with your app to make it easily installable into a venv You missed one flaw: Python's typing story is pretty primitive. You sadly can't really express any complex things, and generics look like an afterthought
Best post on this thread.
It's also worth looking up the pycon2019 talk about subinterpreters and how we might be able to get true concurrency/ remove the GIL in CPython in the future
Thanks! Great stuff
I envy your course. I wish I had a local course like this. I've learn Python all by myself and from the content you showed us, you'll have solid knowledge of Python. Most of the course content are skills that you will need in companies. Wishing you the best of luck! Happy coding!
You should be spending a lot more than 16 hours on this during that course, just like any serious class. Your reading and project work should be more time than the actual classroom time.
Kite is 100% local now.
Maybe that's not a directory where library looks for CA certificates? /usr/local/share/ca-certificates is not a system store. For Ubuntu it should be /etc/ssl/certs. If it's empty, install "ca-certificates" package. Check documentation. See if there's a function to set the custom path.
I would suggest make it hands on course. For each section start with a problem that illustrates the theory that will be in chapter. For ex, variables: get some problem that illustrates why we need variable. Solve that and then discuss variables. For every section think about a problem that tells story why you need that feature and then discuss theory about that feature.
So much this^ If I installed your plugin at work, if it could even connect, it would be grounds for dismissal. It *has* to be 100% local or it's going to die. Kite is a great example of this.
Another way that I've used in the past is to just log the ones that didn't work, and continue.
While it was true they were CPU vulnerabilities, [they were specifically vulnerabilities built around C's limitations](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479), i.e. branch prediction. And saying all they have to do is use the fixed version is like saying all XP users had to do was pay for their license and conficker wouldn't have been a problem.

It is possible to navigate a website using selenium. I have created a tool which takes a \*.side file ( file is generated using selenium ide extension) and replays exactly like you did when you were recording and also it can capture and store elements from the website. If you need help please contact me at [atul23571@gmail.com](mailto:atul23571@gmail.com). I will modify the tool according to you and will send you.
Two things. First of all, this looks like homework. We don't like solving other people's homework unless they can show that they've honestly tried. Secondly, it would seem like you've posted this in the wrong place, and in the wrong thread. Go to /r/learnpython instead, and open a new thread.

Super easy way, append the information from each element you successfully ran and save it to a csv when everything is done. Then you have a record.

This is a really good piece of advice, thanks for sharing!
I love reading stories like this one and recently had mine! &amp;#x200B; Unfortunately it was in an awful workplace (have quitted since and am in a much better place). &amp;#x200B; They wouldn't give me any work despite me asking for it so they ended up giving me the most mind numbing soul crushing task. Of course as an "F\* you" I decided I was going to give my best to finish it and then leave. &amp;#x200B; Long tory short, I had to document over 9000 tickets for an audit. **MANUALLY.** This means, enter Groupwise (ew), search email, save email, save last email, save answer email, change folder name, and done. &amp;#x200B; This took 3 minutes per ticket on a good day when the virtual machine or Groupwise (EW) wouldn't freeze. So that's **3 months** in working days. To add insult to injury I didn't have admin rights so installing anything related to python was a mess. &amp;#x200B; Still managed to do it via COM interfaces and made a script in two days that documented 100 tickes in 1 minute. &amp;#x200B; So that's 3 months or **456 hours to 1hr and 30 min.** &amp;#x200B; After that I quitted :D
Ah, got it.
I wrote a couple posts here and there, and a couple blog posts on Medium, but most of the traffic on my repo comes from [https://up-for-grabs.net/](https://up-for-grabs.net/) and pretty much every contributor comes from there. Helped a lot in early stages of the project.
Will do, and will update
We have &lt; and &lt;&lt;, which if you’re not super concerned about speed, you don’t need &lt;&lt;. It’s confusing to people like me that don’t have formal training in CS despite 14 years of programming experience. I’m totally fine and looking forward to the walrus operator. I’ve done Perl and this is no Perl.

I once had to create tens of emails on a control panel that doesn't provide any API. It was fun watching it fill all the info for me.
thanks, i'll take a look at that and repost this on r/learningpython.
For small projects python has a tool called 2to3 which you run over your python files and it will show you what it thinks needs to be changed and then you can have it make those changes. That honestly does pretty well, it will catch a lot of the basic print statement changes and the list vs iterator stuff. Once you've done the easy stuff then the grindy stuff. You have to run your code on python 3 and see what happens. You'll find that a good amount of packages may be slightly different in 3 so you need to address them or worse they don't have a 3 version so you will need to find an alternative and rewrite it. I've been dealing a lot with byte and string changes since bytes are no longer the default str type.
I would have done the same thing but taken 5 hrs. Efficiency at its best!
Working on collection of scripts that automate deployment of Docker containers for me. It will be in a week or two on Github cause there are handful amount of containers and I am still learning Python
Thanks a lot! I'll have a look at it.
If someone gets here looking for an answer: Sphinx has [autodoc's automodule parameter](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_mock_imports) for the purpose, just place the following in your \`conf.py\`: &amp;#x200B; autodoc\_mock\_imports = \["win32api", "win32gui", "win32com", "win32ui"\] For ctypes and wintypes use the following code: import sys from unittest.mock import Mock class MockedObject(Mock): USHORT = 0 DWORD = 0 \# and whichever other attribute for wintypes you need MOCK\_MODULES = \["ctypes", "ctypes.wintypes", "win32con"\] for mod\_name in MOCK\_MODULES: sys.modules\[mod\_name\] = MockedObject()
Say I’m applying a function to a dataframe in pandas, how much longer would saving the csv each time take?
So what’s the most efficient way to write out x number of digits of pi in Python
Entirely depends on the data frame size, but not long. What I suggest is appending the info about the files you handled to a list of tuples or lists or whatever you like and the saving that one time at the end of the entire job. This assumes you are handling errors so it it doesn’t error our prior.

thanks!
I teach a bit of Python stuff on YouTube, and not sure I would go with the materials you picked. Instead, I would focus on fundamentals like classes, decorators, and creating virtual environment, just to name few.
It is like a while west land grab of repos. Personally I think he should have transferred them to a github organisation account and elected a group of maintainers to look after the projects.
Nice. well done.

The class only collects the window titles.
I'm almost certain YouTube does serve ads from the same host.
Been python teacher for couple of courses, random thoughts: 1. "python crash course" book is awesome basis for building your own program. Wish it was released years back. Take a look – great learning curve, great excerises 2. Idk about embeddable python for KN/MSPP, I've been using jupyter notebook, both for interactive coding and making slides (jupyter can export to reveal.js). 3. Jupyter lab is awesome, if you can/want provide hassle-free REPL 4. Have your teaching program reviewed couple of times, pay extra attention "sequence" of providing new information. I.e. explaining OOP w/o giving good grasp on dicts will be painful (I know it's not your case, but anyway) 5. If students will need to have python installed on local machine – double check if you need 3rd-party packages and hassle with pip. In any case, installing python is not an easiest thing in a world (now it's way better that couple of years ago, but still problematic sometimes). Know target platform, plan time accordingly – you'll spend some, helping with unexpected installation issues. 6. github classroom may be helpful, depends on your goals 7. Double check that you will teach engineering/solving real-world problems, not an academia-related stuff tons of algos. Unless students is super-motivated, nobody cares about abstract tasks.

Maybe this goes in r/learnpython. &amp;#x200B; I can pitch something though: implement Airflow w/ Python for task management.
The only input it was trained on was when you wrote the script earlier?

Most of the time I will be writing an automated script in 40 minutes, for a 10 minutes task with the hope of using it again and again and again =&gt; Profit. Turns out used once. But if I know that It would be used less than 4 times? Still do it anyway, coding is a pleasure compare to manual task.
It would definitely be faster. I would recommend using `multiprocessing` to avoid the GIL (uses separate processes instead of threads)
Thank you!
Learn it the hard way: experience. Never let a huge loop fail and cannot continue when it stopped (logging, write to db, check downloaded files, check modified time...). Always think about failure, wrong input, sudden blackout, sudden internet interruption... And trust nobody when using a 3rd party lib, or your colleague's API. A lot of things can happen and the only to know them all is to let it happen.
the websockets library. install it with pip.
except that you won't notice the GIL nearly as much, if your program is I/O bound. Because I/O does run behind the GIL's back. That said if you're reading 2000 files in parallel from an old spinning platter hd, the harddisk may very well trash and kill your performance. It all depends.
See my other comment; IO can run behind the GIL"s back just fine in a threaded solution
It depends on what you are doing with the files. If the time to process a file is dominated by I/O (reading it and writing an output), having multiples instances of your program running in parallel won't speed it up significantly. If you have a relatively long, CPU-intensive step, then multiple processes will be able to use your CPUs better and offer a large performance boost.
It is definitely possible, since Plotly graphs are meant to be displayed in a browser using plotly.js. Feel free to check out Dash by Plotly, it uses React as well
Oh sweet didn’t know that it’s a thing, Took me all day to make it so it will send it on the discord xD But I might use this API for other projects
**Organize your movies according to Rating** It's not the best but a useful one. Many of my friends have a huge collection of movies. Since I was about to graduate, I decided to take a few movies from my friends. I was low on storage that is why I wanted to copy only good movies. That time I had to check rating manually and it was really time-consuming. I decided to write a Python script to solve this problem for my juniors :) Here is what it does * It renames a torrent movie file to its real title like it renames ***The*** ***Martian 2015 540p HDRip KORSUB x264 AAC2 0-FGT.mkv*** to ***The Martian.mkv*** * Move movies to folders according to their rating. The script will make folders like *GT9, GT8.5,* etc. It means that movies in *GT9* folder have a rating greater than 9, movies in folder *GT8.5* have rating between 8.5 and 9 and so on. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dark-archerx/Movie-Organiser)
Apparently they’ve started a discord where people are sharing images they created on the app: https://discord.gg/xkH6dg7
That looks a bit too complex. For example: for item in endgame: end.append(item[0:13]) for item in avatar: av.append(item[0:13]) endgame_money_str = end[6] avatar_money_str = av[7] Why do you build two lists if you need only one value from each one? Here: endgame_money_int = int(endgame_money_str[0])* 10**9 + int(endgame_money_str[2:5])* 10**6 + int(endgame_money_str[6:9])* 10**3 + int(endgame_money_str[10:13]) avatar_money_int = int(avatar_money_str[0])* 10**9 + int(avatar_money_str[2:5])* 10**6 + int(avatar_money_str[6:9])* 10**3 + int(avatar_money_str[10:13]) you only need to strip commas. Try: value = int("".join([c for c in s if c in "0123456789"]))
The app is still being passed around and they’ve even created a discord for images created using the app. https://discord.gg/xkH6dg7

Yeah it is /etc/ssl/certs where openssl looks for packages. But I think we shouldn't mess with it directly. `update-ca-certificates` symlinks certs to that folder.
It is possible, but there are better ways, there are services that with a API call with de data they generate you a JavaScript plot that you can embeed on your web app. (I don't remember the name but a quick google search will sure find it). Good luck!
Sorry, this topic has already been posted about. Please continue the discussion there.

You can mess there, just don't change or remove any files from "ca-certificates" package and add only certificates.
Hi, Brendan from Kite here! I can confirm that all codel processing is now done locally on users' local machines and your code doesn't leave your computer. Kite is completely free to use for everyone while we're working on building out an enterprise version of our product.
Thank you for your answer
I use Aimp to listen to my extensive library of mp3s I've collected from independent artists and the little bit I've torrented. Generally though, no I don't. I used to mix on my PC all the time but my good headphones got destroyed by my dog so now I mostly just listen to music on the go through my phone. Even in that case, I just have about 3k songs on my SD card and use Double Twist music player.
I created a script the other day that handles Crfs tokens. works really nice
Let me understand what you said. It is free just in the time of the enterprise creation ? After that it will not be free anymore? Or you will have other features in the enterprise one and the current one will remain free ?
Good question! The details are still tbd. We're committed to keeping a version of Kite free forever, especially for students, researchers, and open source developers.
it works exactly like node_modules. stuff is cached in the global node_modules and is then copied to the local node_modules. your interpreter only picks up modules from the local node_modules. if it isnt there, it will give an error. installing it will use the global node_modules and copy it over. there's no more need for virtual environments. every directory is literally a virtual environment
Interesting. I didn’t even know that was a potential option in PyCharm. I’ve always right-clicked on the tabbed code I want to run and click Run from there.
I'm trying to learn the bottle web framework. So far I have fun, and it works. And I finished the first area of my text rpg. 3 left.
I knew what selenium could do so I just read the docs
RemindMe!
It's a program that emulates user input in a web browser. Basically you tell it to find elements on a page and send commands. You could do something like ```driver.get_element_by_id("submit").click()``` and it finds the submit button with I'd #submit then clicks it

When you use the run button on the toolbar, it runs what is configured in the adjacent run configurations drop-down. Clicking run on the side of the run (output console) panel runs the file that is in the title of the active tab (you can pin multiple running files and run them parallel). I usually just right click in code and press run when testing, otherwise my entey point is pinned to the console and have run bound to F2.
We use it at work to automate integration with a site that lacks an API. Unfortunately that means every time they change their site substantially, we start getting errors if we're lucky or silent failures if we're unlucky.

Any thoughts on how this reflects on other packages? Do you think there may be other malicious packages that were not caught?
Just today I received a 11 page word document filled with 1100 emails, and we had to put them in order and delete duplicates. As soon as I saw that I thought "well I'll just make this on Python" half an hour later I had it done, and when a co-worker of mine said "Who wants to read this 11 pages of emails and sort them?" And I said "oh I just did it"
I will try. Tks
Please format it correctly, it's a nightmare to read
There's a arduously boring email that we receive with a csv file that we need to manually modify prior to importing the contents to a database. I'm looking to automate the procedure.
Can [Plotly.py](https://Plotly.py) be embedded into Tkinter?
Well as a general purpose library I'm not sure it'd gain from adding more distance metrics. Specialized libraries with optimized routines exist for that, such as numpy and scipy. Especially if you're working with high dimensional data.
&gt; word document &gt; 1100 emails Damn did that person never hear of excel at the very least?
Also it keeps you in training. I write for work mostly in C, but I script nearly every menial task in python. Just to stay in practice.
Nah I think he downloaded a document and just Ctrl c Ctrl v into the word doc like "that's not my problem to format this"
Matplotlib is quite fast and can be embedded in Tkinter. However I don't think anything Tkinter related will qualify for real-time. (actually, what do you consider real-time to be?)
351
Is not pricey. &amp;#x200B; Is free.
Thanks
i don't understand the question
Disgusting.
Ohhh I see! Thanks for that information and yes, outputting the relative path makes a lot of sense. &amp;#x200B; And thank you so much for catching that bug. It's an easy fix so I'll put it in the next release (which should come out today).
copy paste of the existing code is probably faster.
Any suggestions for installing Python on the local machine? I'm going to checkout https://github.com/winpython/winpython but I need to support also macOS students :)
Interested as well!
The interactive graphs require a web browser engine. However you can render the graphs in the background using [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca) and show them as static images inside the Tkinter window.
You're right, I used the list to pick the right elements and I forgot to change it afterwards. The second thing was really helpful though, I totally forgot you can do that!
Wow I need to learn how to code, my work has me doing boring data entry all day and they are just blown away that I can use excel better than a beginner.
Working on tying my Python and raspberry zero based security camera project into an arduino project. Right now my code uses zero w's to run wireless cameras and a central PC to check the images for people using Tensorflow's object detection. Now I'm working on trying to play an audible tone if a person is detected by connecting to arduino boards over Bluetooth. I could just wire the speaker into the raspberry's GPIO, but I want the alarm to go off in rooms that are quite far from the camera.
You mean accessing the variable by having it's name inside of a string? If so you can do like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; my_arr = [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; globals()['my_arr'] [1, 2, 3]
Can you please post a reproduce-able example to the subreddit r/learnpython
Hint: What is type(type(3))?
I wouldn't call one of them better honestly. If your looking for pure python and you know what your doing, You'll probably be happy with pyautogui. I just found this now and am exicted to dive into it, but I will still use it from within Eventghost. Here is an example of my macro, and you can see what i mean. [https://ibb.co/sCRmyK6](https://ibb.co/sCRmyK6) &amp;#x200B; Eventghost is essentially a translator between various systems, designed with Home automation in mind. I use it more for Windows automation but you can do whatever you want with it, I love the python script action because I don't have to make and run a whole file per script, and easy to hotkey. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; What I've done here is grab the current mouse coordinates, and than copy to clip the block of code I than paste into the macro I'm making. The variables are globals for my other systems to use but you might be able to cut this code down alot in your own build. &amp;#x200B; `import win32api` `eg.globals.h_x = 1` `eg.globals.h_y = 1` `def mPos(x, y):` `win32api.SetCursorPos((x, y))` `def start():` `eg.globals.h_x, eg.globals.h_y = win32api.GetCursorPos()` `print "Mouse was at " + str(eg.globals.h_x) + ", " + str(eg.globals.h_y)` `return eg.globals.h_x, eg.globals.h_y` `eg.globals.h_x, eg.globals.h_y = start()` `var1 = """eg.plugins.Mouse.MoveAbsolute({eg.globals.h_x},{eg.globals.h_y}, 2, False, True)` `eg.plugins.EventGhost.Wait(.2)` `eg.plugins.Mouse.LeftDoubleClick()` `#eg.plugins.Mouse.LeftButton()` `eg.plugins.EventGhost.Wait(.5)` `"""` `eg.plugins.System.SetClipboard(var1)` `eg.plugins.Window.SendKeys(u'{Backspace}', False, 2)`
type(int)? I thought type() only returned int, str, float? And then where does the `just for fun` come in?
About 'hiding': you're looking for the word \*folding\*. PyCharm most certainly can do this. It's quite a visible feature as well to be honest; [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm-edu/code-folding.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm-edu/code-folding.html) About running the file you're working on: just right click the file and choose Run. Short cut: CTRL-Shift-F10. Alternatively use a *scratch file* for short experiments [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/scratches.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/scratches.html)
There are likely thousands of other malicious packages and most malicious packages are not caught. I think the potential for abuse is far greater than the current level of abuse, so it will likely increase in the future.
Better yet maybe submitting an issue on github
I’ve been doing a lot more web scraping lately, if you have any questions feel free to pm me

Be brave to type it in the REPL :) I don't know about "just for fun". Whole line is a comment, it can contain any arbitrary text.
Sounds like a major hassle. Lol. To each their own
The other parts of the problem talked about are also easy to address within that same macro. for example once you have your mouse move and click, you can put this underneath it to paste. eg.plugins.Window.SendKeys(u'{Ctrl+V}', False, 2)
I usually don't submit issues unless I'm absolutely sure there is a problem. There is nothing more obnoxious than responding to issues that stem from people using the package incorrectly.
To be fair that’s basically me &amp; stack exchange
One more thing: don't forget to handle the errors! :) HTTP request may fail, data pulled from the server may change, etc. It doesn't matter for a quick, small program for fun, but it's a good practice. Powodzenia z kolejnymi projektami! :)
`&lt;class 'type'&gt;` So the answer is type! But it didn't list `type` being something that `type()` could return? I think I need to find something better to start with heh.
Bingo! Well, type can return lot of different values. And you can create your own classes, and type will return them with proper argument :)
My code is so simple, I'm looking for any advice on what could be wrong. Google has been of little help. import pandas as pd import statsmodels.api as sm data1 = pd.read_csv('valid7.csv', index_col = 'date', parse_dates = True) X = data1['fnu'] y = data1['ssc'] ests = sm.OLS(y, X).fit() ests.summary()
Metacode. I like it!
After `f.save(secure_filename(f.filename))`, you need to add `f.stream.seek(0)` to *rewind* the stream back to the beginning of the file. You can get more info from this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7389295).
Why is it called corruptSpotify? What’s the point of a bot that plays ads?
Thank you so much for your help! I appreciate you giving me a hint and helping me get to it on my own instead of just telling me. Wow, I had no idea there were more classes, let alone you could create your own and have type() return them. Really, the only problem I seem to have with the online courses I've tried, is that they don't really go into that much depth about what these do and just barely skim the surface.
You sir, are a genius. Thank you for saving me some more hours of frustration.
I'd suggest a try/finally block for this so that even if your script falls flat on its face the last thing it will do is whatever you've put under 'finally'... E.g save the data to disk!
Maybe am.OLS includes a constant by default.

Like D&amp;D ? I have made all the normal games / apps like guessing and magic 8 ball and such. So I thought I would try to make my own D&amp;D dungeon master. Thinking of taking all the pre made ones and making them into lists so that it would be a random ride till I died.
This is my problem as well right now. Nothing really seems to go into a lot of detail on what arguments can be used for just what they are being used for in the rut your using.

I've been building a scraper app with Flask. It takes me back to my HTML days when I would type one wrong character somewhere and the half the page would disappear. Kinda feel like this BeautifulSoup. Keeps giving me the "no attribute 'text'" Coding: writing code 10%, finding that damn bug 90% I do love it when I find the problem though.
It's definitely an.. interesting journey being self-taught that's for sure. What website(s) have you been using?
It's worth mentioning that python comes with the `venv` module. If I'm going to use a smaller tool that I'm not sure about I'll usually use that. For the bigger modules that have well-vetted github projects with dozens of forks and hundreds of stars... I think we should be able to expect security. I'd be surprised if this kind of thing was common at all.
Another obvious malware that's plainly visible in Python source. No word on how they detected it. I'm waiting for someone to find a vulnerability in a binary wheel where the Python code is innocuous and the payload is in the compiled binary.
As someone who knows both Python and Java (not an expert by any means) I agree with this review for the most part. However, near the end where he says 'to print an array in java you must iterate over it's elements'.. that's not true. You can print all the elements of an array using &gt; Arrays.toString(array)
Automate the boring stuff for python and when ever there are free courses on Udemy I enroll even if I’m not ready because who knows when they will be free again.
I'm surprised they found only three.
Yeah, Python is pretty cool.
This is super inspiring! Thanks for sharing. It activates my special spy-gear glasses that give me "what-else-can-i-automate?" vision :D
Thanks!
Good YouTube video on GPT-2 (which this is based on) [here](https://youtu.be/89A4jGvaaKk)
It's actually the opposite, you have to specify you want a constant. But that is not what is affecting my R-squared. sklearn and excel produce the same R-square and they make a lot more sense for my data than 0.99.
U should choose a few libraries and focus on them
1. create dumb simple projects 2. create more dumb simple projects, some similar to the ones in (1) but different in some interesting way. Sometimes this will let you learn something 3. create something more complex/interesting -- use (1) and (2) as building blocks (even if the blocks are just things you learned residing in your head) This helps.
Lol they’re saying do it just for fun
That wasn't a pun, they were being completely sirius.
Oh I totally agree. I’ve realised at least for the first year that quantity is better than quality. Then I can worry about BigO and all that later. Picasso apparently painted over 60,000 paintings. Python/Picasso. I ditched my plans for Hadoop and Cassandra for now.

I tend to use anaconda and not install things from other channels unless it’s widely used and absolutely necessary. I have an expectation that anaconda vets packages they endorse. That expectation may be misguided, but it’s how I am for now.
So sorry
Dude it's people like you who help this community flourish and learn -- thank you for your hard work!!
That's nothing. I routinely spend hours creating and maintaining scripts that most likely save me no time!
Using Try Else? Or something else?
Nice! I’m working on a similar kind of problem with a lot of conditionals using Selenium right now and love that feeling when my script does what I want it to do, can’t wait to be able to just slam out stuff like this at a moment’s notice.
License?
You're reading bytes, rather than a UTF-8 string. I guess that the templating engine sees that it's not getting a string, and so calls `repr()` on whatever it is receiving, which is why it's showing you the `b'` stuff as well as the unicode escapes. You probably want to decode your bytes, like `content.decode("utf-8")`.
