You have misunderstood the proposal. Despite the name "exists", it is not about whether the name is defined or not. Its actually about a configurable way to write short-circuit operators like `and` and `or` where the right-hand expression is only evaluated if the left-hand expression matches some condition. The proposed `exists(spam) else cheese` is *not* a short-cut for: try: spam except NameError: # spam is not defined return cheese else: return spam but more like: cheese is spam is None else spam except that spam can be an expression, in which case it is only evaluated once. 
Ahh, I remember commenting about that.

I know that this is intended as a programming exercise, but starting in Python 3.4: py&gt; import statistics py&gt; statistics.pvariance([9, 2, 8, 0, 4, 1]) 11.666666666666666 `statistics.variance` returns the sample variance, `pvariance` is the population variance.

Wow, that's an awesome and insightful write-up! I have one question though: if we get backpressure automagically through unbuffered, sort-of-synchronous (for the current logical thread) writes, don't we open ourselves to actual deadlocks?

from the official docs: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/ `requests` older version supports `async` feature, guess it's not available anymore due to other libraries http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v0.10.6/user/advanced/
Blocking means that the get() doesn't return until the remote resource is fully transferred or it hits the timeout. So the rest of the script is basically paused until the get() function returns. Increasing the timeout value just compounds the issue since the script will pause even longer in situations where a server isn't responding or responding slowly. You can get around requests blocking as per their [documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#blocking-or-non-blocking).

It can work efficiently, as long as you also thread it/spawn multiple processes. I use plain old urllib2 for a spider, but it calls multiprocess first to spawn multiple processes and then multiprocess.dummy to spawn multiple threads per process, all to call urllib2. Each thread calls a queue which is fed from a database and then puts the responses into another queue which fills another database. I get about 4 pages crawled per second per processor using that setup (1 process per processor and 15 threads per process).

V.P. of Engineering here.... I don't usually look for a "degree" when I'm hiring (I work for a small enough firm that I screen my own candidates). I look for applicants who have good knowledge of "best practices" and "design patterns". I also look for people who program on their own and not just for their job, because people who are enthusiastic about programming are the ones who'll likely bring new tech and ideas into your company. If you don't have a degree, you could look for 12 week programs like CodeCore and Lighthouse Labs, which are usually available in cities with big startup communities like LA, New York, and Vancouver. At least then you'll have "something". As far as learning best practices (super important, at least for me, since you can teach syntax), I'm going to say something that will be deeply unpopular on this forum... Python is a terrible learning language. There are basically two frameworks in wide use, Django and Flask. Flask is a micro-framework, so it doesn't really teach you best practices at all (that said, we use Flask at work, so there's that). Django is set up in a totally different fashion from any other language's frameworks and is extremely opaque. It does a lot of things right, but the WAY it does those things is hidden from you, the programmer, so instead of learning the "right way to program", you're going to learn "the right way to program DJANGO", which won't help you as a general programmer at all. If you're coming in with no education, you should try and make yourself employable by as many employers as possible, and that means learning languages that everyone uses. The Python community is tiny. Generally the only good reason to use Python is if your company does something that needs very efficient computing, like AI or search (I'm looking at Google and Amazon here). We use python because we want to use more AI in our solution. In order to cast as wide a net as possible you SHOULD learn javascript and php. Everyone uses javascript, and php runs something like 83% of the internet. Laravel is a great php framework that will very quickly teach you best practices. It's a good sign of how great that framework is when people start writing frameworks in other languages and call their solutions the "Laravel of node" (Adonisjs). For javascript, there are two main technologies people use. Reactjs and Angular. Reactjs is a library, whereas Angular is a framework, so I'd suggest learning Angular 2, since it's harder to code the "wrong way" using that solution. Reactjs is great if you know what you're doing, but it's easier to hang yourself because it's less restrictive. The angular community is also way way bigger than React's (although React is growing), so that whole go where the jobs are philosophy also applies. The very best thing you can do is to write a very small app and open source it using GitHub so that you show potential employers that you can make something that works and code it right. Don't worry about originality...write a "Honey-Do" list that families can use to keep track of which groceries they need or something. Host it on Amazon's free-tier or get a $5/month digital ocean box and host it there. Don't get carried away here...just write the simplest thing you can imagine and put it in a place where employers can see it. Writing something that works and hosting it on GitHub, where I can see that you've used best practices will put you miles ahead of even people with university degrees.
I put it in a similar position and doing some open source work was some sense of unity which drew us together, it has the behaviour you want. -------------------------------------------------- [*^^[How ^^am ^^I ^^doing?]*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Simulate_Me_Bot) [*^^[Want ^^a ^^bot?]*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=iNeverQuiteWas) [*^^[info]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeKarma4You/comments/5b0r6r/i_am_a_bot_that_will_simulate_you/)
 You should read the tutorial on docs.python.org
There is a lot of mistakes here. The first one not even being the fact that /r/Python is not for "help", but news about Python. The help subreddit is /r/learnpython, as advertised on the sidebar. Also, even /r/learnpython is *not* designed to do your homework. What have you tried? What does not work? What is your code supposed to do? Have you tried to write the algorithm before rushing to the code? Have you *ever* heard of notions like lists, sums, loops, the difference between `if` and `while`? These are only **a few** questions you should ask yourself.

Do I understand correctly that what curio does to control flow is somewhat similar to gevent (with less hacky hell and monkeys)?

I use Pycharm which in my opinion has really good support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I never used vim as a development tool but i assume vim has enough plugins available for frontend tasks aswell if you prefer vim. Just get some linter tools to support syntax and try to get your environment running on localhost so you can easily review changes.
I've been dabbling with PyCharm, and I do think it's probably the way to go. It even has things like LivePreview, so it seems pretty polished.

Your code looks fine. Did you know there's a module for doing this in the standard library? It works with standard in or filenames. import fileinput import codecs for line in fileinput.input(): print(codecs.encode(line, 'rot13'), end='')
the term "efficient" is really context-dependent. If you only need to do the scraping a couple of times, the time it takes to get the code up and running is probably more important compared to running it x times, over and over again.

While this works, one of the principles of python (type `import this` to see more) is "Simple is better than complex" - and Python provides many tools to simplify your code. For example, you can replace the already-simplified code: AIoutput = (random.randrange(2)) #Instead of figuring this out every single option of your conditional statement below #Do it now and be done with it. if AIoutput == 0: AIoutput = 'Rock' elif AIoutput == 1: AIoutput = 'Paper' else: AIoutput = 'Scissors' With this: AIoutput = random.choice(['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']) Many languages use numeric indices a lot - eg in loops - but in python you should generally use the items directly. Good luck, and enjoy!

&gt;-&gt; Variables aren't declared with a type but I find myself doing more type-casting than I would in C++ or Java. So if I don't get any "smart-casting" features like I would in es... why are there not variables types to begin with ? You're not casting. You're creating new objects using the old object as an argument. Explicit is better than implicit. &gt;-&gt; I hate the fact that there isn't a common iteration interface for the two containers listed above (e.g. for var1, var2 in containers which returns index&amp;value for list key&amp;value for map... similar to what Go). I mean C++ managed to implemented a unified-ish iteration interface for over a dozen containers... python only has two widely-used containers. Why the fuck are there 3 ways to iterate a list and 3 different ways to iterate a map ? Because lists and dicts are fundamentally different data structures with fundamentally different semantics. You need to be explicit in how you iterate over these things. &gt;-&gt; I hate the fact that many common operator I'm used with are no in the language (e.g. ++, --, &amp;&amp;, ||) I mean... That sounds like a nitpick. I think 'and' reads a lot cleaner than '&amp;&amp;', personally. &gt;-&gt; I hate the fact that many of the built in functions don't really share and similarities in the way one has to think about them (e.g. there are some functions that are called with containers as arguments which give basic container properties... e.g. len(str) gives you length of str, str.split(...) splits str assuming str is a string. There seems to be no consensus, even among built in feature designers if the language or even its containers should be oo or not). I mean, in Java, I know that if I want to operate upon the members of a class that's built in the language I will do so with class-internal methods. In go I know that if I want to operate upon a structure or entity that's built in the language I will call a function external to it... even C++ manages to keep consistency among various std modules. In Java you don't have a choice. It's either an instance method, or an awkward static method. You seem to be confusing built-in functions, too. str.split is an instance method of str. Len is a built-in function that works on all objects that implement __len__. &gt;-&gt; I hate the fact that the various interpreters/compilers seem to diverge on arbitrary features that don't acutaly seem to matter that much and make code hard to port from one to the other All languages with multiple implementations have this problem. Have you ever tried using ML? &gt;-&gt; I hate the fact that some many features changed between versions. Obviously some were due for a change but other (e.g. changes for the import system) just feel like a syntactic change that accomplishes nothing but to add confusion to someone who doesn't know the ins and outs of both languages. I don't know what to tell you, there. The language is evolving. Nobody is forcing you to use the latest version. Talk to a Perl developer about breaking changes. &gt;-&gt; Finally, I absolutely hate the fact that both 2.7 and 3.X are still widely in use and I thus googling for anything related to python becomes about twice as tedious since I have to realize the person Is talking about 2 or 3 or if the feature they are talking about is version neutral Is it really that hard to type "python 3" instead of "Python"? &gt;-&gt; Oh, I also hate the fact that there seems to be various guides,so posts, libraries and framewroks which haven't been burnt to the ground by the community despite being written in an obviously... for lack of better term, "wrong" fashion.(by which I mean highly inefficient due to easy to correct mistakes) ... thought I guess that in a day and age where half the libraries of another language which I won't name failed their build because someone removed a whitespace padding module, its not so much an issue as another thing that makes me sad. This is a programming language community. Not a democracy. If someone makes a library that does things "wrong", and lots of people use it, was it really wrong? Make your own and get everyone to switch. It seems that your issues aren't with Python, but rather with software development in general. All mature languages have these issues. If you want perfection, then make your own. I'll wait.

A fair question. Dependencies are me outsourcing my code to someone else. If there's anything wrong with that code, I have complicated my life: * For starters, I may not know there is a problem. * If I happen to discover the problem is related to this particular dependency, it may have been fixed on a newer version. * If it has been fixed on a newer version, then maybe I can do a simple upgrade. But sometimes there are breaking changes in between, and now I have to check for hidden side effects. * If it hasn't been fixed, it may at least have an issue already raised with some work arounds. * If that doesn't exist, then maybe I can fork it and put together a PR with the fix. * But maybe the project maintainer won't take my PR, or maybe he or she just doesn't respond, or maybe the project is abandoned. Then I guess I become dependent on my own fork. If the outside project is relatively simple, it makes no sense to take on all the additional risk/work. But if the outside project takes on a hard problem, like datetimes or networking or security, then it makes complete sense to take it on, as it's unlikely you'll become an expert in the subject matter.

That's a great question! The answer is yes, that can happen, under the right circumstances. But: Some protocols (like HTTP/1) avoid this by making sure that both sides always know whose turn it is to read or write. If you ever use an API that blocks at all then you have to think about this kind of flow control issue -- so e.g. even with asyncio's streams API where `write` doesn't block, `read` does still block, so you can have a deadlock where both sides are waiting to read. ...And really, you just have to think about this no matter what, because if you support backpressure at all -- no matter what API you use -- then inherently means that sometimes you aren't reading/writing, so you need to make sure you know when that is. Curio-style APIs definitely aren't a replacement for thinking :-). Arguably they are a [silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) in Fred Brooks' sense, in that they remove a lot of "accidental" complexity while leaving the "essential" complexity. So if the behavior you want to express is that of simultaneously reading and writing from the same socket, then in curio you have to make that explicit by spawning two logical threads, rather than relying on implicit logical threads spawned by the framework. I think this is a win, because explicit is better than implicit, plus you can make sure these threads are doing the right thing for your problem, which the implicit framework threads might not be. But networking code is distributed system code, so you always have to think about things like deadlocks.
The one and only bot I have written was an IRC bot. Also, it wasn't for any form of profit, just to teach me socket programming.

Not a professional programmer, but professionals will often automate testing and deployment. Also automated scaling is immediately important if you don't have access to a multimillion dollar data center. By automating scaling in AWS or the like, you can pay for only the service that you use, rather then having to fund the cost for an array of machines whether you need them or not. These things might not exactly be doing the actual act of making the money, but they can sure as hell help you save a shitload of time and money and headache.

Basically, yeah, curio's APIs are closely modeled on the standard APIs that get used for threading w/ blocking I/O, except that since in curio these are cooperative threads without implicit context-switching, you decorate the "blocking" operations with `await` to mark them as possible context-switches.

Another question: did you forget about connection-close propagation in the curio example? I.e. "if the outgoing connection is closed, close the incoming connection without waiting for a read from it". How would it be handled in that case? With callbacks after all? Another, potentially much more tricky question: is it possible to raise an exception in a task from another task? Basically, "interrupt that async function by that exception". In any of the over 5 aforementioned frameworks. Similar to sending a system signal to a single-threaded non-async process. Although the main use-case I have for such need is selective stopping with logging. Edit: and a hopefully simple question: how hard is it to convert a non-async library into an async library now? A while ago it was very non-trivial.

&gt; did you forget about connection-close propagation in the curio example? I.e. "if the outgoing connection is closed, close the incoming connection without waiting for a read from it". Not sure what you're referring to exactly. Maybe you mean the code in the protocols example that detects when the outgoing connection attempt fails, and then cleans up? In the curio code, if the `curio.open_connection` call fails, then it will raise an exception, and `proxy` will exit with an unhandled exception. I do take advantage of one little nicety of curio's, which is that if you use `curio.tcp_server` to spawn a worker-per-client, then it automatically wraps the call to each worker -- like `proxy` -- inside an `async with client_socket: ...` ([see here](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio/blob/master/curio/network.py#L80-L82)). So the incoming socket is automatically cleaned up whenever the worker exits, whether successfully or not. But if curio didn't have that little convenience, then all we would have to do is to add our own an `async with source_sock: ...` at the top of `proxy`, that's all. No callbacks. &gt; is it possible to raise an exception in a task from another task? Basically, "interrupt that async function by that exception". I don't know of any Python async packages that expose an API for this -- all they provide is a way to send a single specific cancellation exception. In principle it'd be trivial to implement, though; just no-one happens to have done it.

~~It means the author corrected the misspelling in the quotation.~~ oops, it's the opposite
&gt; The Latin adverb sic ("thus"; in full: sic erat scriptum, "thus was it written")[1] inserted after a quoted word or passage, indicates that the quoted matter has been transcribed exactly as found in the source text, complete with any erroneous or archaic spelling, surprising assertion, faulty reasoning, or other matter that might otherwise be taken as an error of transcription. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic) So basically exactly the opposite of what you said.

Kinda, but not nearly as sophisticated. While they're both similar in that they are out-of-core dataframes, mine is targeted at a very specific use-case (i.e. to allow split-apply-combine [and each of those steps in isolation] in a scalable way on a single machine).

I think you shouldn't need the one_shot() context manager. When reading the /proc file just get all the info that is there and cache it in the Process object.
indeed ! self promotion: I use it for some code manipulation inside emacs, now only to change [a method signature](https://gitlab.com/vindarel/redbaron4emacs), but I believe we can have more refactoring tools thanks to redbaron.
Sounds cool! I've been working on a small project lately that similarly does some out-of-core stuff, and it's interesting how far a little code can take you if you're not aiming to do everything :)
&gt;If you can't tell the world your product, then why do you even have it? For profit? 
Maybe you don't have pip installed. I can't remember if by installing Python, you automaticaly get pip... Are you able to run the "python" command? Maybe you can try this command "python -m pip install requests"
Absolutely - so far I can already do stuff like: df = mylib.read_csv('foo.csv') df2 = df.query(df['col_1'] &gt; 20) # this is now a new "table-backed dataframe" df2['col_2'] = df['col_1'] * 10 + 15 with only a couple hundred lines of code. Python is ridiculously powerful for stuff like this because you can map between types with just a simple dict.

You don't always need others to know about what you do in order to make money.
Those are good concerns and I think are advisable as a default train of thought. However, I'd point out that programming is inherently stochastic--which is why we endeavor to write unit tests, integration tests, QA, etc. We're all writing code on t he shoulders of giants (even embedded systems are going Linux nowadays). I also seeing such a philosophy being somewhat untenable for any reasonably large, multi-team organization where the difference between a 3rd party dependency and other-team dependency becomes simply whether or not you can find the source code (as opposed to assured/known functionality). Again, I think that's some solid thinking. I simply hope people take it with a grain of salt when trying to apply it to their own situations. I would hate to have a lot of NIH when python has some really robust libraries out there. 
PyFME developer here! In principle one should be able to model the aerodynamic coefficients of the rocket using the "Aircraft" class, but perhaps some work on the high-speed aerodynamics would be needed. Would you be interested in exploring that path? Feel free to submit a GitHub issue!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot for your feedback :) Let me address your questions: * We use a Runge-Kutta 4(5) method to integrate the equations of motion and they are fully non-linear, so we expect good accuracy up to 4th order. We still have to becnhmark this against real world data though. * The time interval is adaptive thanks to the previously mentioned method, you can specify the time domain from the outside (see the examples for instance). * Ooops! Would you mind opening a GitHub issue about the failing examples? * You are right, we don't have a user guide or getting started documents but we're working on it. * The library is pure Python so it should work on any OS running Python 3. We develop on Windows, OS X and Linux but currently the continuous integration is running only on Linux - we are planning to expand that in the short term. * True, because this started as a learning project with some colleagues from university - we already have some interest in translating the documents so we will focus on that. We honestly didn't expect so much interest so bear with us because it might take some time for us to adapt and translate everything :) Thanks a lot everybody and keep those comments coming!
I think modeling drones is a very interesting upcoming application for PyFME! If you have any specific concerns please feel free to ask. * I am not sure about the status of the ball because another dev was in charge of it. In principle all the coefficients are in place but we have no examples using it, I encourage you to open a GitHub issue just asking what's the status of it. * The aerodynamic coefficients were obtained using DATCOM, AVL​, JavProp and the Roskam book. We should upload the data files and the scripts we used, if you open another issue (there's no such thing as "too many GH issues!) we will track the task from there. Our Newton gravity solver only works for one body so it's not really suitable to solve the n-body problem. To solve the 2-body problem for celestial bodies, please checkout poliastro, another project of our team http://poliastro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (which is much better documented by the way).

&gt; Well, at least /some/ information can be cached forever, like ppid, name, create_time, terminal. Of these, only the create_time is immutable. * `ppid` will change (and be set to 1) if the parent process dies on unices * `name` can usually be changed though it's a bit of a pain in the ass: [many BSDs have `setproctitle(3)` and some unices allow setting `argv[0]` and then there's a bunch of platform-specific hacks](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle/blob/d6a43b14470d806984d03079164ba05cebb997d0/src/spt_status.c#L328)) * a process's controlling terminal [can also be changed](https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/01/reptyr-attach-a-running-process-to-a-new-terminal/) through ptrace(2) hacks. Also note that psutil *already caches immutable properties* (and notes it explicitly in its doc): ppid is cached on windows and exe and create_time are always cached. &gt; In general, a nicer interface would be to declare that everything in a Process object is a snapshot in time of the status of a running process, never changing, and if you need to get an update you would create a new Process object for the same pid. Why not but then it should not be called a *process*, because it's not, because it doesn't reflect the state of the process. Instead you might capture a Snapshot from a Process object (which only acts as a Snapshot factory for instance). In fact one option might be to have the Process behave as it does and a new method would capture a Snapshot with the same API but only reflecting the process's metadata at its creation. Of course that might mean a much more expensive extraction as you might need multiple calls to generate the full snapshot (IDK) and thus you may want your snapshotting API to explicitly subset the possible process information. I'm sure that was considered and discarded in the run-up to 5.0. Or maybe it was not, IDK, you should ask /u/grodola &gt; I don't mean to say psutil is bad, just offering design alternative. The problem is your design alternative doesn't really work.
&gt; Not sure what you're referring to exactly. This piece of code on `OneWayProxyDest`: 61 def connection_lost(self, exc): 62 self.source_transport.abort() 63 self.loop.stop() as far as I see, there's no equivalent in the curio example. I.e. if the outgoing connection is dropped, the task will only stop on the next event from the incoming connection.
This together with unyielding have done what I have wanted for a long time: they've finally convinced me that `async`/`await` isn't just worth the colouring, the colouring is a good thing. Thanks!

You asked about bots that make them money. If they make a bot to make money it is not a product they are selling, it is a program they made for getting money. If you get a unique idea and make a bot to exploit a situation you don't want gazillions of other people doing the same thing because that might mean the opportunity goes away and so does your profit. 
We agree on the same thing, and I wasn't clear enough. I should have said: "Therefore, people must distribute the imported code under the same license." My point is that the description of the project in Github isn't clear enough about licensing. You see, I guarantee you that many programmers don't even know or care about licenses. This is probably why many people are "copying/pasting from Stack Overflow". Personally, I think that it should be stated very clearly that once you import code from StackOverflow, your whole application must be distributed under the same license (ShareAlike).

Well, you could have made your point without even mentionning pendulum since they are general concepts that have nothing to do with a particular implementation. So, I can't help but having the impression that you want to put me in my place. I may be wrong though. And you mention an issue (https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/issues/59) saying &gt; Don’t tell the community that a competing library is doing it wrong, when in fact those libraries are doing it correctly, and your own library didn’t even support your example until a few days prior, and has other critical bugs like the DST transition example above. This bug only occurred when adding days, weeks or months since days are not always 24 hours long and going through UTC won't fix that for you because in UTC every day is 24 hours long, let's take an example: &gt;&gt;&gt; paris_time = Delorean(datetime(2013, 3, 31, 1, 30), 'Europe/Paris') &gt;&gt;&gt; paris_time_utc = paris_time.shift('utc') &gt;&gt;&gt; paris_time_utc_delta = paris_time_utc.datetime + timedelta(days=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; tz_aware_delta = Delorean(paris_time_utc_delta).shift('Europe/Paris') &gt;&gt;&gt; paris_time.datetime.isoformat() '2013-03-31T01:30:00+01:00' &gt;&gt;&gt; tz_aware_delta.datetime.isoformat() '2013-04-01T02:30:00+02:00' But I wanted to add a full-day to my datetime in the `Europe/Paris` timezone so it should be `2013-04-01T01:30:00+02:00`. In pendulum: &gt;&gt;&gt; dt = pendulum.create(2013, 3, 31, 1, 30, tz='Europe/Paris') &gt;&gt;&gt; dt.isoformat() '2013-03-31T01:30:00+01:00' &gt;&gt;&gt; next_day = dt + timedelta(days=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; next_day.isoformat() '2013-04-01T01:30:00+02:00' &gt;&gt;&gt; (next_day - dt).hours 23 However, I may be misunderstanding something again. So, if you could point me in the right direction to do that with Delorean I'd appreciate it.
Nobody said it couldn't. However, that doesn't mean it _should_. This community's about bringing people together, not degrading others.

Also, if my program isn't able to find metadata for a song, it waits for 10 seconds, asks the user whether they want to manually enter it or not and then continues to process other songs. Also, thanks for the response! I'm pretty new to building projects, this being my second project and I know there's a lot of stuff that would be frowned upon by experienced programmers, but I'm trying my best to learn.
I'm going to create my own bot to find bots like yours, in hopes of stealing the bot ideas you found.
Thank you!
Ah okay, I can understand there is probably a logical reason for doing it the way you have, but I wouldn't be able to see it until I tested it myself. Nothing to really frown upon here! I'm not experienced programmer though. Be wary of your imports, you import some things that you never use. 
I hope you find it useful.

I have reviews on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2fvEnax) and here are some links to others: - http://www.i-programmer.info/bookreviews/62-python/7694-python-101-.html - https://pythontips.com/2014/07/01/book-review-python-101/ - http://za.github.io/2014/07/08/python101-review/ There was one guy on Amazon who didn't like my book, but wouldn't respond to me when I tried to reach out to him after I had tried to fix all the issues he had with the book
Heck, even Daniel Greenfeld (pydanny) told me he recommends my book - http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/03/23/pydev-of-the-week-daniel-greenfield/ which surprised me
I hope you like the book!
&gt; the information is still valid I mean... how would you know?
I think I am running the most up to date version of Sierra `10.12.1 (16B2555)`. No issues so far
This isn't really a Python question, but more of a "Tell me how2eml". Wikipedia's article on [Email Header Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email#Header_fields) is a place to start. Read the relevant RFCs (such as [RFC5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322) and [RFC2047](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047), and [RFC3864](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3864)) for what to expect in fields. Read into each field as you come across them. Create a function for parsing all fields, and then do what you want with the contents of each.
I mean code examples. You gave an example of a problem you couldn't find a way to solve that you liked, but no examples of what you tried or what you think would be a better solution and why.
I must not be using it to its fullest, but on my commute there's a long old tunnel where I have zero LTE access and I use that time to block out code for work, or just play with new things I've learn in the std library.
Awesome! I have tried to build some tool that downloads and visualizes boundary data myself before, but I had problems to get complete and consistent data for a specific bounding box. I'm glad you (?) made this, will check it out tomorrow :) **Edit:** I had some issues installing fiona/gdal under windows, but once I got it running, it is pretty cool. [This image](http://imgur.com/a/0ep46) shows a radial street network of Hamburg with a radius of 8km around the center point -- with only 3-4 lines of code. Of course this is only artistic, but the nodes and edges are available in a NetworkX graph to work on. Some things should be noted, as the keyword arguments are sometimes not as stated in that article. For instance "type" is "network_type", and "dist" is "distance". I can't wait to hopefully see a nice documentation soon. It would also be really cool to have some more built-in attributes of streets to use, or plot the actual boundary along the street network. 
The dictionary is a map, I just called it map out of convinience. Its not like there are two or three or whoever many types of maps in python, there's only the dict, so I believe that's totally fine. Also, set tuple and string if you want to be precise, but the string is basically a list with some added abstration and who the fuck uses sets and tuples ?
Thanks for making it available for free! I have been out of work on medical leave and money is super tight. I've been trying to make good use of my time while sick learning :)
No one is saying that it's good. There saying that the problem/inadequacy is in the spec not the implementation.
&gt; You're asking for stuff that they never claimed to be trying to do. I think this might be phrased too strongly. The goal and scope of the project seems to have been scaled down over time. If OP didn't disappear, he/she might be interested in reading some of the older mypy blog posts. It seems originally designed as an alternative mostly-python-compatible VM using the static types to drive compilation to C. Over time, it has instead focused on bringing static types and some inference to Python to help manage large Python codebases, which is also a worthy problem. See http://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2012/12/why-mypy-can-be-more-efficient-than.html
Superb! Thanks, was just starting out in Python!
I learned using [django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/). I started off there, creating the tutorial project. Then worked on creating a mock restaurant search engine. If you are already familiar with python, the docs should help you get a long way there. 
Bought it. Thanks for coupon.
So, I am quite new to python (self-taught programmer. In high school. Worked as front-end dev part-time for a year~). Currently learning useful things (python cookbook, effective python) and trying out all kinds of libraries. A bit of everything, that's what kind of person I am, I want to have at least a bit of knowledge everywhere. This week's accomplishements: - Learnt using csv module - Learnt the basics of matplotlib and gpcharts. Wrote a few practice graphs of csv data I got from worldbank. Damn, those population change graphs of different countries are interesting. - Basics of beautifulsoup and scrapped a chinese novel website. They only provide books in chapters, so I had to copy paste every book I was about to read (I like reading from my kindle). Conclusion: python = useful for everyday life. - Learnt some flask. Started working on a blog (not too practice, but I actually want to start blogging). - Got annoyed of db (dunno why) while using flask and am taking a look at TinyDB. Looks very reasonable so far. - Also, put a simple wp website together for a client. Hate it, python is way more fun. 
I didn't mean free books that are free all the time like dive into python, I meant books that go free for a promotional period. Books generally don't go free because they're very good and selling well, they go free to promote. Given that 201 was also free at some point, it doesn't seem like this person's books are selling like hotcakes. &gt;Furthermore it's "currently free" so if your caught up in it's "free-ness being bad" you might as well get it for free, check it ou,t and then leave a review. I already got the book. I have limited time to study and my time isn't completely worthless so knowing whether or not something is considered good amongst python users, which I thought was a reasonable question, heavily weighs in on whether or not I'll actually spend time with it. I already read some of learning python the hard way and I really hated the way it tried to teach and regret wasting my time with it so I don't really wish to repeat that.
Well isn't that nice of you, thanks a million Mr. Driscoll.
i was joking
Sure, but what you're doing is comparing civil days, not solar days. Time is difficult, and painful, as you're showing... but that doesn't mean using UTC is wrong. If you want to compare civil days, then it should be explicit, however... I think your library should not be using civil days by default when 99% of developers will be expecting solar days, but that's just my opinion. &gt; It inherits from timedelta but adds more properties that you would have to compute yourself otherwise. So are you changing the definition of "day", then? Or are you doing some kind of munging on the data after the timedelta is done, to deduce the number of hours?
SimulateMe! HairyPlotter
You're welcome!
A bunch of (poorly written) unit tests broke because of a module upgrade. Currently trying to decide if I want to deal with fixing all of them right now or push off the package update.
You say that 99% of developers expect solar days but it's "your opinion". Isn't this a bit contradictory? Anyway, from my experience most people will work in civil days since it's the most intuitive. I mean, adding one day is what it is, you expect to get the same hour/minute/second the next day regardless of any DST transition that might have occurred. And I'm not saying that UTC is wrong, far from it. It's just that when you add/subtract days, months or years, it becomes less relevant since it can't handle transitions properly. In the end, if you're satisfied with what you are using, that's fine. But don't try to bash pendulum because it does not behave like what you are used to. Edit: for the timedelta I am not changing the days property it's just that there is no day in the timedelta only 23 hours. &gt;&gt;&gt; (next_day - dt).total_seconds() 82800.0
Yeah since it's a completely different paradigm of running code, you need to adjust your thinking about IO and force it all to the top. Which, honestly, we should be doing *anyways* but synchronous code doesn't necessarily punish is for doing it that way (though there are languages like Haskell that *do* punish you for doing that, but that's an outlier). 
do you have a github account?
I started working on a project that provides a graphic for the top 10 teams ranking in a sport throughout all the months of 2016, using **pandas** for reading a *.tsv* file, **matplotlib** and **numpy** to work with the graphics. I still have some issues with the fancy label I'm trying to do for this graphic, but things have been going well!
Your concerns are legitimate but you also need to realize that no language is perfect. I use Python because there i s nothing better as far as interpreted languages go even if i find some aspects of Python frustrating. In any event you might want to look at Swift which seems to borrow much from Python but leaves behind the troublesome aspects. Oh and about variable declarations i to find Python frustrating. I'm of the school that you define what you want as a programmer and rely upon the compiler to flag any improper uses. Of course this is partially about choosing the right language for the task at hand. 
I've actually been told by other people that I'm selling it for too little. I am going to start experimenting with the price on Leanpub though.
Another PyFME developer over here! You would also need some modifications on the dynamical system we are integrating: for rockets flat earth hypothesis is not realistic at all, moreover, as other attitudes could be reached, we should use quaternions, instead of euler angles. Just to point a couple of modifications that should be done!
The books that sell like hot cakes are usually by big name authors, like Grisham or Stephen King. Writing a Python programming book is definitely very niche. I'm just trying to grow my audience a bit.
Regarding tha ball example, it is not currently working. But we'll fix it soon! It was just created as simple example of the integration at an early stage, but we included Magnus effect =P However, until we implement the quaternion attitude equations we won't be able to fully test it (the rotation of the ball could produce Gimball lock)

True true. I know this. I honestly cant say if Im gonna read this anytime soon though. Lol. I think Ive used enough resources and now sorta trying to work on coding something of value, reading stuff like Python Design Patterns, and other languages. Though I understand the intent. Hopefully it works out.
Well, did you get the full version ? I only got 10 pages as a sample version. Seems like false advertising ? Not to be sounding ungrateful, mind you. Just..curious ? 
I haven’t had a chance to look at the book closely, but do note that this market is pretty saturated, and asking for money isn’t going to help. If I can get a lot of good resources for free — including large books, why bother paying? PS. if your platform allows it, include full ToC in the excerpt. Gives a better idea of the book.
But where do you get your 99% from?
Please do. That'd be really helpful. Thank you for the book, it's exactly what I needed.
I disagree. Because, the standard library misbehaving does not mean that you have to settle for it. Especially when other languages do it right. I mean, there's a reason why we have libraries like `dateutil`, `pytz`, `delorean` or even `pendulum`. They are here to fix flaws in the standard library and to get the proper behavior.
To stay on topic... moment js is a client side application, and would be expected to use civil time. ...and the PHP and Rails are not examples of languages we should be trying to copy with Python. I'm sorry, but PHP and Rails both have inconsistent, buggy, and fundamentally flawed datetime handling. So does Python, too, though...
I'm an electrical engineer who has had experience with C/Assembly, Java, MATLAB in the past. I also learned Python first in my job for some random stuff, but now moreso as a hobby language. I've only been in the work force for a year and a half but lately I've realized that my job is not something I really want to do. What you recommend as to how to start with Django and/or Flask? I'm not familiar with Web Development and I'm not really sure where to start with that kind of stuff. Recently I've wanted to get into mobile app development using Kivy, but that'd be more of a personal thing. Finding a way to transition my career into coding with Python sounds like something I'd like to do.

SQLAlchemy doesn't seem that difficult thanks for the tutorial
For django I just went through the tutorial on [django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/). I need to run into stackoverflow for a lot of things I don't understand, but the docs are detailed enough by themselves. I can't remember what tutorials I used for flask. I think I cloned an existing project and went through the source, modifying it as I go along learning it. 
It is not as good as I want it to be. When I don't have a project to work on, I am actively searching for jobs (permanent). I miss having colleagues, collaborating on projects etc. Most of my friend circle used to be from work and since I changed to freelance, my social life took a hit. Not to be a pessimist, but there are pros and cons. 
IIRC if you are not doing it with right equipment you lose money on electricity.
also codeacademy and khanacdemy, great interactive widgets
Well I don't have much of a social life now, to be honest. Sounds like a win-win to me. My work has two other engineers. Two. They really nice dudes, but not people I am friends with outside of work. The office has 7 people total, all not really people I connect with. I actually think working for myself would help me a lot in regards to my social life. My job being unsatisfactory has really taken a hit to my emotional well being. But this is /r/Python, so I'll end it there haha. 
The fact that other people do it, doesn't make it right. I guess as a sysadmin Unix epoch time has spoiled me.
Who decided it's bad practice to add a day to a datetime and get, regardless of dst transitions, the same hour, minute and second, which is what you would expect anyway? 
Not necessarily random, but yes, people host websites and then pay content creators to create engaging content for the sole sake of bringing in viewers. Viewers translate to ad revenue or sales of a particular item, and that's where the money is made.

In case anyone here knows: I have an Anaconda distribution installed on my PC (numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc etc). Does anyone know how I would go about installing this package into my existing distribution? If I try to do it with conda, it doesn't know this package. If I try pip, it gives me an error message (I'm also not sure whether pip works well with conda). Thanks!
virtual environments are actually pretty simple, and breaks down to this: - pip install virtualenvwrapper (or virtualenvwrapper-win if you are on windows) - mkvirtualenv &lt;name of environment you want to make&gt; - deactivate (to turn off) - workon &lt;your environment&gt; (to activate it)
D'oh! I've had a few false starts already. Maybe this book will be a real start in coding for me. When it does , I'll chip gladly in and let Reddit know how good the book is. Thank you for the opportunity!
Thanks. Does pip always install to the current venv? I wish pip did dependency management. Is the "way to use requirements.txt" just pip freeze?
Probably belongs on [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) but as I'm feeling charitable I'd start with something like this [easygui](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easygui).
Your point originally was, with Pendulum, you are trying to make Python more like these other languages, right? But these other languages behave the same as Python. I'm confused what you're trying to say here... If you don't use UTC, you're going to end up off by an hour when working relative to other timezones. If you'er only working in the local context, you'll be okay... until you're not.
Thanks, man!
&gt; Your point originally was, with Pendulum, you are trying to make Python more like these other languages, right? Only regarding the use of civil days.
Legal or not, it's a dick move. Literally theft, unless you also anonymously pay them for the wasted energy.
As said, the Process metadata is mutable except for exe(), create_time() and (only on Windows) name() and ppid(). These are all the values which are not subject to change in the lifetime of a process so there's no need to cache the rest as you usually want to collect "fresh" info every time you query the process (think about CPU times, memory info, IO counters, context switches, num handles, etc.). One of the most common use cases of the Process class is to use it in apps like top, ps, etc. where you list all processes in a loop an updates info on screen. &gt; In general, a nicer interface would be to declare that everything &gt; in a Process object is a snapshot in time of the status of a &gt; process, never changing, and if you need to get an update you &gt; would create a new Process object for the same pid. That doesn't sound like good design (re-instantiating the class). If you want to get a snapshot of the process state you can just use Process.as_dict(). Then it's up to you to store that info somewhere and use it as you wish. Years ago I pondered about caching all process info then adding a refresh() method or something. I believe PSI, a lib similar to psutil which is no longer maintained, provided something like that, but I later concluded it wasn't a good idea and that it was better to delegate this choice to the end user. For an app it's just easier to store the as_dict() info somewhere (even storing it to the Process class itself) rather than reading psutil doc or debug in order to figure out why cpu_times() keeps returning the same value.
That's just not true. Let's take a look (I will use pytz here to have proper timezone support): &gt;&gt;&gt; tz = pytz.timezone('Europe/Paris') &gt;&gt;&gt; dt = tz.localize(datetime(2013, 3, 31, 1, 30)) &gt;&gt;&gt; dt.isoformat() &gt;&gt;&gt; '2013-03-31T01:30:00+01:00' &gt;&gt;&gt; dt = dt + timedelta(days=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; dt.isoformat() '2013-04-01T01:30:00+01:00' # No offset change, that's bad but we can fix it &gt;&gt;&gt; dt = tz.normalize(dt) &gt;&gt;&gt; dt.isoformat() '2013-04-01T02:30:00+02:00' We are off by an hour compared to all the examples in other languages: PHP gives `Mon, 01 Apr 2013 01:30:00 +0200`. Ruby gives `Mon, 01 Apr 2013 01:30:00 CEST +02:00` Javascript gives `2013-04-01T01:30:00+02:00` Go gives `2013-04-01 01:30:00 +0200 CEST`

Heads up /u/driscollis, something is off with the styling on the bottom of your blog homepage. getting some overlapping text.

I think this will be my last message on this matter. You are so stuck with your idea of always going through UTC that you can't even see that's not always appropriate, especially when you use civil days which pretty much every other language does. I mean, you acknowledged it earlier in the coding subreddit but, now, for some reason, you seem to have change your opinion again. If you want to keep using a broken system (I mean it's common knowledge that the datetime stdlib is pretty limited in Python compared to other languages) and not acknowledge the fact that Python is the exception here, that's fine with me. I will continue to build pendulum to solve a lot of issues people have when working with datetimes. It's just not for you.
Lots, lots more, and some. Pandas is like a jet fighter compared to Excel for statistical processing, nothing else comes close in python (that I've come across). Numpy is indispensable, you just don't get around working with it. The general purpose algorithms and low level features are just too useful to not use. Numpy is fantastic, though, it makes python worth it for scientific development. Without it python just wouldn't be a scientific language. Scipy is much more specialized. In my line of work I sometimes need the linear algebra and signal submodules, but usually it's too specialized to fit in a lot of applications. It's great to have when you do need it though. 
It's why I like WinPython. It makes packaging my apps to not Pythoners easy, I send them a zip with a 'run this.bat' and everything is self contained.

&gt; of any way in the sockets API to detect when a write-only socket has closed AFAIU, system's select() will react to a socket getting closed on the other end. But then, are there write-only tcp sockets from the system's perspective at all? I suppose in a more realistic 'proxy' there would be 2 workers spawned for each incoming connection, reading from incoming and outgoing sockets, and notifying each other if either connection closes. And a size-limited queue in between. Or is there a better way to do a simple proxy?

I actually wrote a bidirectional proxy example and then ended up not using it... something like this: https://gist.github.com/njsmith/4b4e75a9ab9e975705412f8f8e866948 Not tested, and you can see what I meant about [curio needing to provide some better utilities for managing child tasks](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/#orphan-tasks), but hopefully gives you an idea.
Unless you've read all the books that's ever been posted there than I dont know. That being said it sounmnds like you need Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - teaches you the basics of Python and somee projects and while I can see some merit in not googling or searching the documentation. Your going to have to get real on that. Unfortunately the language evolves and book writers themselves value their time and cant include everything . Though as long as they give you the toolset to lead you on the right path you should be fine. That being said quit awdling and go get yourself. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Unfortunately Im not sure if it's free but Ive seen it for pay in physical stores and amazon. (I personallly got it via Humble Indie donation though). It'a highly reccommended here and if your still not trying to waste time with freebies than you can verify with a number of already exisiting reviews for the item. There is also a Udemy course if you want to check that out by Mr Sweigart and he frequents /r/inventwithpython to motivate and maybe halt your forgetting python because you dont have a project.

Trying to figure out why my C extension is crashing whenever I exit the interpreter. Or if it's actually the destruction of an object that's doing this. I'm not totally clear which it is yet. Error in question: &gt; Error in `python': corrupted double-linked list &gt; Error in `python3': free(): invalid pointer
This is amazing. You're amazing.
You'll get a lot more help at /r/learnpython. I believe that error is something to do with needing Visual Studio for a compiled piece. I might suggest using anaconda and trying to find a precompiled version of the library you need. 
First, this is a very good talk and he makes a number of valid points. The reason the talk itself was unclear, in many respects, is that the 'problem' he's talking about (exposing internals) is also a powerful advantage - allowing us to implement things in Python which would be difficult or impossible to implement from the dynamic side of other languages. He, himself, clearly uses these internals to advantage in his own code - and enjoys the flexibility that they offer. He also bemoans that exposing those interfaces makes the underlying interpreter difficult to change. These interfaces are clearly a double edged sword, and should be treated with respect. 
I also got the Pytho 201 free a while back. Thanks for this one too. Planning on doing python professionally and this will b great help THANK YOU

Not really a "project," but I've been working through Project Euler problems when I have a few minutes here and there, have learned quite a bit. Also made a little web scraper that would get my account balance for our cafeteria, where we got a set amount of "free" money for food every few months (which I figure comes from my tuition). The script would print out the balance, average spending per time, and whether I should eat more or less to last the full time but not have any left over.

Assuming you're using requests or urllib library, you won't load any of the images or scripts on the page, just the page html. I'm pretty sure google relies on JavaScript to send page view events to its servers. I don't know the solution but that's the likely cause. Maybe you can use selenium or something... 
&gt; While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. I can understand that. I was wondering if this book was something i could give to a friend that wanted to start programming, and my conclusion was that it's not. It's a decent book if you already know how to program and is curious about Python, but not much help in learning programming itself.
Right, I misunderstood you.

I think exactly the same thing: I hate adding a dependancy just for a small thing, even if I'm the author of the required package. For this reason I love singole-source-file packages: just copy a single .py file in your project source tree and that's it. If you want to update it, just download it again. If you need that package in another project, it's only one cp command away. It couldn't be easier. Obviously this applies only to helper packages, as you say.

Not sure what you mean, please elaborate.
Concerns off the top of my head: I feel like there would have to be very strict guidelines to define what constitutes a bug fix or a new feature. By that I mean how much are these snippets allowed to change? What if someone wants to add a keyword to a utility function? Should that be made in to a new snippet? Even if you say the snippets would never be that big, how big is too big before the code doesn't belong on the site? Cool idea though.
Thanks! Somehow I completely missed the link explaining how to get geopandas working.
Thanks!
It's an introductory book, but as OP stated somewhere, it may be better suited for people with *some* programming experience. That said, Python isn't hard to work with, and you can find lots of tutorials online, if you are stuck with the basics, and you can always ask in /r/learnpython if you have questions.
Thanks!! I also got your other book Python 201 :)

It used to be a ridiculous green with more cartoon graphics. It's gotten more modern with a sparse web portal style now. (my own conjecture): It might help position it as more professional and get more interest from non-students, allowing it to better compete with newer but more stable frameworks like Kivy (with Kivent), PyCEGUI, etc. I imagine others might worry that the old style matched the playfulness of the community. It isn't meant for professional games and is rather built for ease of use (though that aim is complicated by the lack of stability).
I am trying to learn GeoPandas as part of my Programming for GIS class. It keeps giving me this error message in my Jupyter Notebook when I try to import it.

Any suggestions? 
Check and see if there is a PyCon coming up in your area. It is a great place to do networking, specifically for Python.
Try `conda update --all`, looks like one of your libraries expects a newer version of one of your other libraries. Also, post questions in /r/learnpython next time.
Haha! Didn't know this phone provider (french here).
You have an incompatible version of the lib libnetcdf.11.dylib. Another library called libgdal.20.dylib requires version 12.0.0 or later for the libnetcdf lib. I would try to google the error message first to see if there's a certain solution and then I would try to install a newer version of libnetcdf.
That's very nice of you. Thanks!
Just PM me and I might be able to help you out ;)

&gt; But what is helpful are the few really good decision trees that you also generated along with the bad ones. You wouldn't call any individual tree per se wrong or right, what matters is that averaging over them will yield good results. You mention something similar later on, but this sentence is just wrong. I do agree that it is very useful, and it is usually the first model I try alongside a linear one.
Thank you for your response. My idea was to set an arbitrary limit(say 300 lines of code with 80 characters max(~3kB)) and allow changes in that limit. There wouldn't be usernames just individual passwords for each snippet.
Sorry for the incomplete answer, but tf-idf could be useful here. Perhaps you could bucket the entries by month or week and then find the words with the highest tf-idf values for each bucket! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf
As a side note, consider posting this type of question under /r/learnpython, or on StackOverflow.
nice writeup I still wish doing the non-norm wasn't such a bother, my personal setup is, install python globally, and then `--user` install pip and all subsequent packages (don't need to runasadmin to update packages as a result), which means I need to manually find and add a directory to PATH as well, and then find the relevant visual C++ compiler hidden on the microsoft site, and install that too, and then still need to manually install things like numpy. I guess I could use anaconda, but that doesn't sound as fun

That's not completely true. Their back end data handling is built in Python. The game itself is built in C++.
Thank you. As for the docs, you're right, this is just the first version
For sure, there are multiple ways to handle the full implementation. I just wanted to point out that the OP probably wants to use some kind of abstraction layer. Ensuring that layer is robust is something I leave up to the developer and the constraints of their environment :p
Ifyouaretalkingaboutsomethinglikethis, I can suggest an algorithm ;-) PM.
You're right, and I'm not claiming it is. It just makes thing simpler since you only have to worry about seconds, and (ideally) not a bunch of time zone conversions. 
There's no reason to see dependencies as a bad thing. I don't care how small, it is much better to use a modular approach than create monoliths of code.
When I was in college they taught us C++ and I got a 10/10 but didn't become a programmer. I picked up Python a year ago and am now regularly using my scripts at work in a department that has come to rely on them... Wish I got more into it 10 years ago

...care you explain what you think is wrong? It looks very unremarkable to me.
Python is a language that allows this to happen: "Hmm. I bet you I could write a script to automate that repeated process we do here in HR. I used Python for a few months back in college and feel like I could put something together in a week. You won't have to hire a developer or contractor. I know that you're an HR manager, not an engineering manager, so that would be a non-start." And then later: "Wow. That script Chip Dipson wrote really is saving us some time. I wonder what else we can automate? Maybe we should consider a part time position for this!" And so forth... Adding Python to your business is so non-committal.
A couple of observations: - I think that adding another repository manager doesn't reduce dependencies, it just splits the dependencies between two managers eventually making things more complex, no matter how simple your repository will be. As already suggested here, it is best to keep things simple - either use established package management practices or just copy-paste the code snippets. You otherwise get yourself into tons of problems that were already solved such version management, external dependencies you cannot avoid (such as the Python version), access management, etc. - If you feel you do need a private managed repository, the best IMHO will probably be [a private PyPi server](https://gist.github.com/Jaza/fcea493dd0ba6ebf09d3). If your main focus is managing your private inventory as a separate layer then there are all kinds of ready solutions such as [PyShop](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyshop) which I personally didn't try but looks pretty well documented.

A similar thing happened for me. I went to school in the early 2000s and learned C++/Java. I didn't like it and didn't use my degree. Then I learned Python around 2008, and it was like programming finally made sense. Now I'm a professional programmer. 
I'm working on my next little project exclusively in my 1.5hr (to/fro) commute time. Coding using Python on an iPhone. Doesn't get simpler than that. Python to me is natural and super quick to get to from Zero to 60!
the C++ compiler works without a hitch though easier than ctrl+f'ing around a page, downloading a file, then manually pip installing that file I'd rather a small bit of compile time
They basically own this space. The people who use it just as a contact database can ignore all posts like I do, and the people who will read your content-farm quality/networking/motivation blather/social posts can read them. It is trivially easy to maintain professional relationships. Although for many it's hard to avoid destroying them by pushing "personal brand" content at them with mailing lists or LinkedIn junk posting. The problems in this area are not technological. So you cannot provide value to your users, if you want to try to rent-seek in this space you are competing with LinkedIn.
git hub examples ?
Any reason not to just use Logstash with Winlogbeat to ship the log events to a a remote server running a suitable storage backend (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ or whatever and then pull the log data from the storage layer with Python? Shipping the logs themselves is a solved problem.
That was a great explanation. I understand what its for and roughly where to start to learn to use it. I very much appreciate it!
You might get more help at /r/learnpython or /r/flask. Flask-login docs are pretty small because it's a very basic library that only takes care of the user sessions, there isn't much more to it. If you check out Miguel Grinberg's flask mega tutorial, I believe he walks you through most of it. 
When I was in University from 2002-2006 we learned in C/C++. Then I worked with Java for many years... I left computer science completely for awhile and had never discovered Python. I am still pretty new to Python... anyways, I thought the conference was cool. I don't have any experience in industry with Python currently, but I found it made programming fun again for me. When I left programming the first time I kind of thought I just did not like programming. And then I discovered Python, and thought it was very cool... I know some view it purely as a language though.

Haha so it sounds like data science is taking over and Python is just along from the ride? Have you tried The R language before? I just started looking at it only briefly.
Thanks for your comments. I'm not sure if you watched the videos I linked but I was not trying to generate the best password maker possible (as you can tell it is quite simple). I was trying to code up the advice from the computerphile videos and the XKCD comic to see how well those passwords stood up against the dictionary attacks etc. The topic is tricky and requires more thought than my bored scribblings on a random Sunday morning. You can make a really really long password which is hard to crack if the attack is brute force. Adding random symbols should (in theory) fool a dictionary attack. I am not an expert, this is my first attempt at anything like this. I was mainly looking for someone who has the cracking tools and GPU power to try cracking a few hundred of my generated passwords. Regarding the timing. What I have done is fine for now :) I don't care about ms precision or better. I was curious if this would take multiple seconds or more. I'll check out novault, thanks. 
I cant point to any in specific but snagging some bytes from `/dev/urandom` and sticking it into the session and storing it server side should get you up and running, however you may want to base64 encode it to make sure it doesn't cause any problems. But like /u/jerknextdoor said flask is more of a do it yourself type web framework than Django is. But the basic flow of it would be something like this: from flask import Flask, render_template, session import base64 @app.route('/login') def login(): #insert login logic here token = base64.b64encode(open('/dev/urandom/','r').read(256)) session['loginToken'] = token writeToDataStore['userID'].token = token #insert render template @app.route('/') def home(): if 'loginToken' in session: if readFromDataStore['userID'].token == session['loginToken']: #render page as logged in or something like that EDIT: after thinking about it for a minute it might be better to have a table in the db where the primary key is the login token and one of the other columns is a foreign key for the users table. That is just me thinking out loud tho :P
Thanks! Guess I just need to buy and read the other 101 books. 
I think this is just great. I'm an experienced php developer by trade but overall it seems that python is a much better language &amp; community. I even attempted to switch my career to Python before but got pulled back in to php. 
Sentiment* ~~semantic~~ analysis would be good! I'm not sure of any Python packages I'm afraid (I don't analyse this kind of data) but I'd be surprised if there weren't any. A bit basic but a word cloud?
If you have an open source python project you can display your download statistics on github by hosting this flask app on heroku and linking to it from your README: ![download stats](https://my-heroku-project-id.herokuapp.com/)
The problem with that is `*There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.*` falls apart once. I'm trying to do controls work with Python. Do I use SciPy's Signal or [control](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/control/0.7.0)? With Matlab it's one package. Stuff like this is what is keeping Python from getting adopted in a lot of places it's not.
Thank you!
Couldn't i use a JSON Web token library for logging in and out in flask. 
I have discussed API logins at length in my blog articles, tutorials, and also in my book. If you want to see come code examples, I can suggest: 1) https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/api-pycon2015 This is code that I preseted during my PyCon 2015 talk "Is Your REST API RESTful?". The authentication for this API is based in JWT tokens generated by itsdangerous (one of Flask's dependencies). 2) https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky This is the code from my "Flask Web Development" book. This is a much larger app. The API portion of this application also uses JWT tokens for authenticating clients. In both cases I made a choice to not use Flask-Login as part of authenticating API clients (the example from the book uses Flask-Login to authenticate regular browser clients via username and password). The reason I do not use Flask-Login to authenticate API clients that pass tokens is that Flask-Login is great at maintaining a user session, where a user logs in, uses the system, then logs out. A well constructed API is stateless, so there is really no need to have user sessions.
What do you do aside from programming?
Hey thanks, thats awesome!
I join you in sharing similar experience. C# has been my primary language mainly for ASP.NET web development for more than a decade. In the past, I have also used VB.NET, VBScript, JavaScript, Java,.. occasionally. But I experienced a pleasant surprise and enthralling joy when I started learning Python 3-4 years ago. Learning and doing things in Python felt like boon; I started enjoying programming more. And now I think faster and more intuitively during coding. If option available, Python is my natural first choice. Wish I had learned Python earlier.
 R supports many assignment operators and `=` can be used in place of `&lt;-`. The weird operators in R are due to historical reasons. It is fine to use `=`. R has more robust and a larger variety of model fitting tools, especially when you need to model strange error distributions. I use both R and Python for research and they are both capable languages but some tasks are better suited for one or the other. 
I see Python has grown quickly for 3 different reasons: 1. **The REPL** -- [The Read-Eval-Print Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) -- There's another popular language that allowed us to do this much the same way: BASIC. If you're a n00b, the REPL is super important for quickly figuring out how to code. As such, both languages have had quite a long run of popularity because it's been easy for people to pick up and try out. 2. **LOTS of Libraries** -- I think xkcd summarized it best here: [**Guy1**: But how are you Flying? **Guy2**: I just typed `import antigravity`](https://xkcd.com/353/) 3. **The Hype Train** -- For anything to really succeed, there has to be at least a little bit of cheerleading. At the risk of being downvoted, I'm gonna say that Python has a bit of the Hype Train thing going on. Don't misunderstand me. Python is a really good language (that I code in almost every day.) Hype isn't a bad thing. You need just enough to keep things interesting. Or maybe, I should say that there's been enough continual development in the language and a willingness to improve (version 3.5 and formal Type Hinting, finally!) that makes Python something you feel like you can invest yourself in. Now if only we could get the Python 2.7 lovers to finally come over to Python 3... :) 
No problem!
Great cartoon, and points made. Yea, Python is definitely not meant for every solution. It may be in a bit of a bubble, but I just started using Python two years ago, so I don't have a lot of perspective about the ups and downs of the language over the years. 
I'll certainly think about it, but I'm not so learned on this topic that I feel confident in my contribution. Is that even the scope you want the project to have? To me, the layman expectation is that if I gave the program a list of worlds, it should lemmatize them all and return a dict where the lemma is the key, and the value is some other kind of complex structure like a namedtuple, the attributes of which are the parts of speech for the word. Something like that. What are your thoughts? Is that desirable, or broader than your objective? Edited: Cause woah I'm bad at this.
Not full time developer but about half my time at work is spent writing applications for my teams, and recently I've been writing replacements to old C# business logic components for us, and building reporting/BI tools. I went to school for biomedical engineering but didn't really like it - I didn't enjoy C++ but when I found Python I really enjoyed it - it felt very intuitive and allowed me to replicate and replace things in Matlab that I did - including my senior design project. I got to transition roles and take on additional tasks by automating and improving a lot of ways we used to do things and showing the owners what I can do for them given the chance. Working for small companies is my favorite because you get to wear multiple hats and prove yourself, and if you have great bosses they appreciate and reward you for your hard work.
You could try using Lists, rather than nested dicts. For example, inventory.weapons could be a list rather than dict. inventory = {'weapons': [], 'items': []} dagger = weapons.Dagger() inventory['weapons'].append(dagger) inventory['weapons'].append(dagger) inventory['weapons'].count(dagger) See https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
That statement is about the pure language structure and the standard lib. If the market / community develops 15 different ways to do something, "python" can't do anything about it, the matter will auto-solve at some point. It was a long-standing joke, for example, that python web frameworks were too small and too many because it was just so easy to write one, every website developer would have his own; that's not happening anymore, without any intervention from the core team.
Can you quantify the accuracy/inaccuracy of the lemmatizers you tried for English?
Spontaneously, there's a de-facto separation between your local fs and the virtualenvs you're building. You can have a running set of modules attached to your root python instance without having them necessarily copied(default) over to your virtualenvs. They're separate. Alternately, your system path has a ton to do with it. You don't have to to use a virtualenv for every use case/app of/in python but you have to inform the sys.path of the scope of your work. 
Personally I would use a single long list, and filter it: weapons = [x for x in all_items if x.is_a_weapon] You have an option to store a quantity in the object instance, so that they can stack. You probably do not want to implement "20 arrows" as 20 objects when you could have 1 with a quantity of 20, and add/deduct each time they are gained or lost.
Try adding an user agent to the request header.
I'm not sure what the difference necessarily is but on Python 3.5 if I do: python -m venv env --copies I don't get any site packages, just a clean interpreter. Often need to update pip though so something like this, again on windows: env\Scripts\activate.bat python -m pip install --upgrade pip 
Thank you! I'm enjoying the opportunity to create these for everyone.

What program are you using for your online diary? 
Lemmatization presumes you already know the part of speech. If you don’t assign it a part of speech then the word "love" is ambiguous (is it a noun or a verb?). In [1]: from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer as WNL In [2]: lemmatizer = WNL() In [3]: lemmatizer.lemmatize('loves', 'v') Out[3]: u'love' In [4]: lemmatizer.lemmatize('love', 'v') Out[4]: 'love' In [5]: lemmatizer.lemmatize('lover', 'n') Out[5]: 'lover' In [6]: lemmatizer.lemmatize('loved', 'n') Out[6]: 'loved' In [7]: lemmatizer.lemmatize('loved', 'v') Out[7]: u'love' It sounds to me like you don’t want to do lemmatization, but rather want to do some kind of clustering based on morphological roots?
It looks like the problem is food[0:] you can either do just food, or remove the for loop and use print "".join(lol)
Not without the problem clearly defined we can't
Do you mean random forests specifically? Or ensemble based data analysis methods? Or just data analysis in general?
Miguel i been seeing you literally everywhere, and i have looked at your tutorials and i learned alot about sql alchemy from the mega tutorial you did, im going to check out the links you provided, thank you for reaching out :)
It helps the readabilty to cache deep object references like this. name = weapons.Dagger.name weapons = self.inventory['Weapons'] if name in weapons.items(): ...
&gt; delivered to your earbuds You monster! You're discriminating against normal headphone users! What are you, narrow-minded? (JK, because some people on the internet can't read a joke. ;)
Have you looked at word2vec?
The code is in the stackoverflow link The issue is the instantiation of the sysloghandler. With no address specified it defaults to localhost and port 514. That doesn't work. A common domain socket to use is '/dev/log', but that also doesn't work, so the question is what does syslog.openlog() default to address wise so I can mimic it with sysloghandler... this works: syslog.openlog(facility=syslog.LOG_LOCAL3) these don't: handler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address='/dev/log',facility=SysLogHandler.LOG_LOCAL3) handler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(facility=SysLogHandler.LOG_LOCAL3) where 'doesn't work' means messages written to that handler fail to show up in the actual log.
I didn't say there aren't things scipy doesn't have. I said the controls module is poorly done.
I'm sorry, but that's the reality of it. I'm not going to oversell you on the quality of a package. Yes, you should be using Matlab if you care about controls or you should write your own. If you know the topic, I'm sure you can do it.
/r/learnpython 
To all people in this thread commenting on Pythons quick growth... Remember, Python is 26 years old. Older than Java, older than PHP, older than JavaScript. 2.0 came out 16 years ago. I've been using it around 20 years. It's had explosive growth at least twice, around Django/web dev, then bioinformatics which sort of merged grew into larger scipy phenomenon.
I'll have to point out your post to the OMEG PYTHON FOR ALL ENGINEERING people that I occasionally run into. &gt; you should write your own. That's the thing. I just don't have the time. It's easy enough these days to control Matlab with Python so I'll probably just write some sort of wrapper.
wrong place, post on r/learnpython
Excuses. You can do it. I wrote pyNastran. I didn't think I had time; it's ~70k lines. I'd do it, but I keep taking on projects, so... When the developers for commercial programs written for Matlab use your software, you're not doing so bad. Ironically, it still supports Matlab. You just gotta find a topic you care about.
The thing is it'd be developed on company time (and even if it wasn't it'd be a very gray area). Lawyers told one engineer we can't even submit bug reports for OSS because "It might contain proprietary information and a company risk". Plus I didn't quite get my MS in controls. I mostly trust that when I swing hammers the hammer knows what should be done. (As most engineers do). As I was sitting waiting for a 'simple' ``lsim`` to complete wondering if it could be GPU accelerated. I'm wondering if redoing some core functionality (ontop of SciPy's implementation) in numba would be worth it.
That's interesting. So if you have 3 people who want to play Monopoly, but only have 1 hour to play. Your program will pick an appropriately timed board game within those parameters, like cards against humanity? 
Im using just icloud notes, but it saves a copy as an email. So im just gonna make each one as a txt file
Why are you using C instead of C++? You won't have problems with `free()` in modern C++.
Yes, effectively: 1. User logs in, gets a JWT back 2. All calls to the flask server include this JWT somehow, usually a header. The server on each request authenticates the token and populates the "user context" as a middleware 3. Logout with jwt isn't really a thing (there are ways to do it, but they're not as common). You pretty much just stop holding onto it as a client. The big thing with JWT - be sure to use SSL! If someone grabs the token, they can easily impersonate you.
I am working with Flask for a while now. I sure will check Sanic out to see differences in performance. You could write the docs at https://readthedocs.org/ or at least create a wiki at github if you got the time.

1. SciPy 2. Numpy 3. NLTK The Python language is easy to grok and pretty easy to get into. The above libraries have got to have a huge impact on Python's popularity. A whole generation of people seem to have discovered k-means clustering...I mean machine learning and the three libraries above make it approachable for non-traditional programmers.
Omg you're the talk python to me guy! I love your podcast! Listened to it all the time on my commute to university, thank you so much!
That's exactly what I settled on yesterday, cheers and thank you
There could be an 'author' field in package description as well as a link to the snippet's github page where the pull requests and bug reports could be managed.
&gt; &gt; easy to install &gt; Nope. Well, it's *not* because I don't provide a `setup.py` that it's wrong to say "easy to install"... (only 4 lines to copy/paste in bash...) Anyway, I agree with you that setup.py and requirements.txt would be useful. I'm open for a pull request, that would be cool if someone has time.
I think I didn't express the idea well enough. This would be more of a collection of helper functions with a command line tool that helps download, include and update them as static code snippets. There would be no dependencies **at all**. I mean even if you want to contribute to a project that uses this tool, the snippets would be packed in with rest of the code so no one would require to install it.
Because I'm writing a library more than I am a python extension. I'm trying to make sure that there's a common code base for C, C++, Obj. C, and Python, with a nicer API on top. 
Nasty ants.
probably the worst day to release this
Something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm?
Thanks! i do have it formatted the way you posted above in the text editor but i just copied it to here. Thanks for your help!
Yes exactly. If the part of speech is not explicitly provided, WordNetLemmatizer assumes it's a noun. You are right, I am trying to cluster based on morphological roots.
SimulateMe! Huuge
As a computational linguist I'm familiar enough to see that you've bitten off an enormous amount of work. Without some external resources like verbnet, etymological resources, etc., this is going to be a lot of work. Good luck.
easy install would be: `env/bin/pip install talktalktalk` No need for excuses, python package without `setup.py` is not distributable and for easy project like this, you could learn how to create `setup.py` (basically copy from tutorial, fill in the dependencies and you are good to go), no need for PRs here.
Yes, multilevel. So you can debug your original and minified JS from the Python source.
Honestly I'm not that sure the REPL is that important for learning! With modern tools compilers are plenty fast enough for people to learn on. More importantly if you go directly to interpreted languages you mis many learning opportunities. Frankly i see a REPL as more useful to professional users that already have the basics down. 
&gt;&gt;holds different immutable objects Nope. Is itself immutable. Example you put a dict inside a tuple and the dict can still change.
Thank you, Added those to pocket.

Plugging py.test again here: ``py.test --durations=20`` will show you the slowest tests (with setup/teardowns included).

No, I mean automoderator might've nuked it because of your links or something.
Since Transcrypt generates JS from Python, could you indicate what specifically would be needed for integration. I have no experience with Jupyter Notebook.
LOL :)
Needlessly condescending. 
Yes, exactly! 
they are terrible, definitely getting behind this project
Oh man, I can't wait to try it, thanks! 
Oh. I wasn't aware that links were forbidden in the comments
I doubt they are, automod just gets triggered every now and then.
Well, sadly most of us still have to deal with code developed in 2.7 ( we have legacy 2.4 as well =( ) this page can be useful for people who need a quick look :) 
Yeah something of that sort, not sure how well it would work. Maybe even just calculate lev-distance between strings or if you are looking for something faster maybe some sort of LSH function 
I don't now what's needed, but I am looking forward to what you come up with.
Pythonista app is really good get the newest version supports python3 and 2 Pythonista 3 by omz:software https://appsto.re/us/XxRUab.i
Thanks, and sorry for the mistake. o7 cap
sponsorship? 
&gt; am I over-complicating it? Yes, you are. I think you can automate it in shell more easily and generate CSV file or HTML. I think in this case will be Python too verbose vs shell script. On other way, if you are collecting some complicated data structures described by XML or JSON then Python will be a better option. 1. Start with a shell script to gather data and return them in some particular format. You will probably need to take care about used shell because AIX will have probably POSIX shell. 2. Make distribution &amp; collection script: list=( 10.0.0.1 192.168.0.1 another_ip ) # array with server IPs list for i in ${list[*]}; do scp script ${i}:/tmp; ssh ${i} /tmp/script; done &gt; collected_data.txt 3. Now, you have collected all data and you can post-process them in your localhost. Maybe convert them to XLS, to make customer happy with https://pypi.python.org/pypi/csv2xls/0.4 . 
The thing is that some speculations are going around that maybe in next year our RHEL6/RHEL7 workstations will be dropped and EVERYONE will be using Windows or Mac. As far as I know sh scripts are not cross-platform (fix me if I'm wrong) and I wouldn't be so happy if I'd have to re-write the whole thing in any other language. (...and as I said previously I hate writing bash scripts and I'm desperate to learn Python) Thanks for the answer though, seems like a great solution only not for me. :)
I think it's a nice idea. If you ever get time to check if this actually works, I would love to know about it.
Sounds like experience. Thanks.
Fabric runs on Paramiko for SSH support, so it's kind of like a frontend already.
Thanks. I feel like am closer, but still having issues. I should clarify that the input string could also have a ':' character. The only splits I should need are on '/', '.', and ':'. Here is an example: 8/1/1.1.1.16.1 8/1/1.1.1.17.1 8/1/1.1.1.18.1 8/1/1.1.1.2.1:110 8/1/1.1.1.2.1:120 8/1/1.1.1.20.1 8/1/1.1.1.21.1 8/1/1.1.1.22.1 Unclear on why the split references '[' and ']' characters. Either way, when I run the code I am getting: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '' I think it is because its trying to run map on integers, but there are non-number characters it cannot convert to decimal?
I second the suggestion of looking into config management for this. Ansible or salt would be a good fit to doing this sort of work. Bonus: Ansible or salt could correct Amy issues with these files you're checking too - fixing incorrect permissions, etc
Windows 10 has an [Ubuntu bash](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) implementation so it may not be a bad idea after all. 
&gt; I just wonder who there is out there who can't learn Javascript. I wouldn't say I *can't*, but I sure don't want to, and it's not worth my time for smallish projects. I know basic JS, but I've never done real web development, so I have very limited experience. That said, much of what makes JS programming annoying is integrating it with CSS and the DOM, which I suppose would still be a pain regardless of language.
*Side effect: Might summon Cthulhu*
1. Go to /r/learnpython 2. See the Numpy docs, e.g. [numpy.std](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.std.html).
Assuming you're asking about visas, we do sponsorships. It's highly dependent on the type of visa that is needed. TN1 is pretty easy to do; H1B can be sponsored but the likelihood of getting one is pretty low.
2.7 what is that?
Python 2.7 =)
i think this is even more helpful than the learn python the hard way book 
Thanks! So this could run a script that I put on my phone? I wasn't sure because of how iPhones handle file systems...
Absolutely! That is the point of a configuration management system - to manage your system's configuration! 
Hi, I (and my team) created ESEngine, an ORM like MongoEngine for ElasticSearch take a look https://github.com/catholabs/esengine
and macOS comes with bash by default. So it isn't an issue there either.
Learning to tell people to fuck off is a lost skill in the open source community. Most FOSS dev are too nice, too respectful and PC. You need to learn to send people go to hell, and realize your life is yours, and you don't own anybody anything. That doesn't mean you don't have responsability. You should always be respectful with people that are. But any asshole deserve a swift kick in the butt or being ignored if you don't want to spend the energy. You give a part of your life to make something free and good for others. Do not feel guilty. Do not try to analyse if your behavior was correct or not. There is no doubt to have here. Respecting yourself is the fondation. 
Hi, I have a Wow Auction House scanner up and running with python + elasticsearch and kibana. Works perfectly.
It runs a very large amount of python scripts. As long as you're not trying to use something like Pandas that has C dependencies it's great.
elasticsearch-py, works like a charm if well implemented. If you have the time, check this: https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/ it have all the base that you need.
IIRC its been merged into the sphinx project, so you just have to turn it on. It worked well, the times I used it.
The fact that the parentheses in your comment (emoticons included) are balanced is really satisfying. 
&gt; 1. You can ask to receive N bytes exactly and asyncio will take care of that for you This isn't actually true of either the asyncio protocol API or the asyncio stream API. (Quoting the `asyncio.StreamReader.read` docstring: "Read up to `n` bytes from the stream... this function ... may return less or equal bytes than requested...") I don't know of anything in twisted that does this either. Not sure what you're referring to. ...and that's actually a good thing, because for many/most protocols, you don't know how many bytes you want to read. For example, it's actually impossible to implement HTTP on top of a read-exactly-n-bytes API. &gt; 2. Even if you decide not to read now from the stream for a while, asyncio will read in the background and buffer the data for you This is always a bad thing; not sure why it's in this list. &gt; 3. For sending, you just write some bytes and asyncio will take care of the details. Exactly the same is true of curio... Look at the curio example in the blog post. It uses curio's `sendall` method (which is inherited in turn from the stdlib socket module's `sendall` method), which just does a loop over `send` until all the data is sent. No buffering, no partial writes, you just call it and it works. Basically the design space is, you have to pick between: (1) writes might not write all the data, (2) writes might block (from the perspective of the calling code), (3) writes use a hidden buffer. (1) is sucky and hard to use, like you say. Twisted uses a paradigm where blocking is really painful, so they can't chose (2), so they chose (3). Curio can assume you're using async/await which makes asynchronous "blocking" really easy, so it chose (2). If you really did want a read-exactly-N-bytes call, then it would be trivial to implement a similar `recvall` in curio: async def recvall(sock, nbytes): buf = bytearray() while nbytes &gt; 0: chunk = await sock.recv(nbytes) nbytes -= len(chunk) buf += chunk if not chunk: break return buf And this still doesn't need or benefit from random buffers. So I think I stand by my claim that *if* you have access to async/await, then you don't need any user space buffering in your low-level read/write APIs, and in fact are better off without it. Also FWIW asyncio's current configuration knobs are not actually so great -- asyncio `StreamReader` only provides one knob, the `limit` argument, but you have to be careful with this because it also affects the class's semantics (in particular, it sets the length of the maximum line you can read, if reading by lines). And in any case, `limit` only controls one part of the buffering. Most of the buffering (256 KiB, which is 2/3 of the total buffering in the default configuration) comes from the transport read code (see `max_size` in `selector_events.py`), which isn't configurable at all except via monkeypatching. And, of course, this is still the thing where first we write code to add something (buffering), and then we try to write some more code on top of it to get rid of it again, but with only partial success... curio's approach is to just not write any of that code in the first place. It doesn't solve everything, but it certainly makes things simpler :-). 
Btw, look into "path similarity" from wordnet. It might be a nice direction to next. I've implemented a few lines of code that will do pretty smart "matching". We used a cutoff of 0.5.
there is not api ? 
When you says in step6 *Now compiled and run the python program*... why you need to *compile*? 
I forgot about wxpython or tkinter when I picked PyQt4 ;)

Oh I completely overlooked that it's .NET! Well, for Linux there's Mono so compatibility would be covered at least in that direction. I didn't realize this was about IronPython, I wrote the comment before coffee.
I never used IronPython. Is it still mantained? Are there some limitations?
I have no idea. I only ever use the CPython one and I'm perpetually stuck at 2.7, because I'm old and nostalgia loves how print reminds me of the glorly days.

Sounds terrifying, I struggle on 15".
It's about the same unless you replace an i7 Air with an m3 macbook. There are many configurations of both your Air and the 2016 macbooks.
I'm sorry that I can't answer directly but does this [Why is my compiler not recognized](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/672002/why-is-my-compiler-not-recognized-/) help?
This [IronPython Development Update](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/ironpython-users/2016-July/017649.html) looks rather promising :)
Not critique really, just a statement/question.
I was planning to build a logistical regression model taking CVS files as input (for learning) and I am considering if I should use numpy or pandas for it. ANy input would be greatly appreiciated.
Well the problem there is that he's using CUDA 5.5 which is not compatible with MSVS10. But that's not my case, I'm running CUDA 7.5.
Sounds really cool! source link?
I have an i7 air... It currently handles everything very well. I would buy the m7 (?) upgraded MacBook.
Okay thanks I'll take a look!!
This is a great idea. This might be able to connect "history" with "historian", something that my present code can't do. I need to check this out. Thanks for the idea :-)
Are you aware that the data you show above is one massive string, not maybe 100 individual strings?
Working on a little static website that is pretty much a curated list of what can and cannot pet rats eat. As a rat owner I'm having some trouble with this subject. The information is scattered around in various forum posts, articles and weird websites, so my goal is to put it all together in one place. I decided to use `pelican` static page generation and github pages as hosting. Majority of the technical work went into making the theme which was surprisingly easy. I'm not a frontend engineer but jinja2 is just so fun to work with! The other part being the content itself. I thought of using webscraping to scrape those posts and generate the markdown files for pelican but the posts and articles don't have clear structure and lots of information need to be researched anyways - so it would have been more trouble than it's worth. This is by far the most time consuming part - the content itself. All that being said, it's quite fun little project that hopefully will be of use to someone.

Writing a fairer mark generator for my sports teacher. We have to play basketball, and he just wanted to give someone who hits a better mark. I though there is a fairer way calculating difference into the equation, and so on...
No problem, I understood that your question wasn't a critique. 
Judging by benchmarks [this](https://browser.primatelabs.com/v4/cpu/search?q=2013+macbook+air) and [this](http://barefeats.com/images16/lowlap_gees.png), the CPUs are about the same speed in the new machine vs the old one. However the supporting tech like the SSD and whatnot will be quicker.
I think you'll find that the macbook is meant for really good performance on short sprints, and not a long marathon. I would suggest you either replace it with a Pro model (my personal preference, one without that totally ridiculous touch bar, probably) or get yourself another air. My 13" pro runs a setup pretty similar to yours, but most of my work is done managing a doc. management program, or working on excel and tweaking macros. edit: clarity.
He's buying a laptop for its form factor (factors like size, weight and location of air vents), so how can you recommend him a quad core i7? It will be heavier, less mobile, and won't be able to be used in bed without a board under it, because it'll have air vents on the side or underbody.
I forgot about wxpython when I couldn't work out how to use it with Python 3. IMO the big ones are PyQt, Kivy and Tkinter. Plus whatever that one is that does Android/iOS, the name of which currently eludes me.
Well, it's either optimal work or ultra mobility. Few days ago Louis was comparing new MBP to one of Razer thin laptops and that Razer throttled so it's better to have a laptop with good rear exhaust and cooling. I use PyCharm - it's not bad, but that Java can eat some of the CPU. Browser would be next. Many developers seems to like ThinkPads due to their keyboard and there are 15 or smaller ones and some have a quad core. There is like Dell XPS15 which is quite small due to that ultra small bezel. XPS13 with a dual core is there too.
This isn't about MBPs. That's a different category of machine. edit: The Dell XPS13 is actually quite good if you're looking at a MBP replacement and you don't use the trackpad. Neither is really an MB.
Thank you so much brother.
No, county election offices do not have APIs. The Associated Press puts reporters at the county election office and then gathers data at the national levels through the Secretary of State. Those feeds are proprietary 
Consider shelling out the money for an interviewing/recruiting service. This person could make or break you. And you don't have the knowledge needed to technically vet them. Perhaps find local experts in your area and contract them to do the technical interview for you. (I'd do it for beer, honestly)
I completely understand his stance, and see how contributing to a very successful open-source project could lead to this kind of situation. I also understand that Python is not officially backed by some big companies (I mean full-time), just like .NET or Java. Some core developers appear to be paid to work on Python (like [Guido](https://gvanrossum.github.io//)), and some companies appear to sponsor development sprints of Python, but I guess that the majority of the time spent on Python is the result of [volunteering](http://blog.python.org/2016/09/python-core-development-sprint-2016-36.html).

I took it. Frank is an awesome teacher, and as /u/walterdragan says it is a good course to get a starting point. You will learn all the terms that are in enumerated, how to code it and a brief introduction to how the math/stats/logic behind it works.
This is probably the smartest way to do it.

Sqlite is generally more for testing and development. You will likely be better off with MySQL, Postgres or MS SQL. From there, SQLAlchemy has a good set of libraries. One trick that simplifies things is to use Pandas. Pull your data, create a pandas DataFrame with it, then call to_sql() on it. This works on smaller projects where you are handling relatively small data imports. I do this on a dataset that is about 2G per data load. 
From the [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on) site, it turns out to be of "lifetime" access. I have never taken an udemy course so I am not sure whether it is possible to download lectures locally (don't think so, but hopefully I may be wrong)
Anything can happen if you don't unit test.
Have used https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elasticsearch extensively. Works great and I see no need to further abstract API calls. You don't really need much for API documentation from the client side; utilize ES's documentation (as ccb621 points out.) ES is powerful but has so many switches and levers. I think it simply takes time to build and exercise your ES knowledge. The client API is really pretty irrelevant IMO. 
You are definatelly looking for TinyDb. As easy as it gets, very reasonable and good for small projects.
I'd start out with SQLite, unless there's more than one writer concurrently. Otherwise I'd go with something else like Postgres or MySQL. If you're ok with writing ODBC SQL queries, I'd recommend [db.py](https://github.com/yhat/db.py) as the interface, It integrates nicely with Pandas. 
TinyDB is JSON-based, so it will become slow quickly.

Look at dataset library (sqlite as backend I think).
Whenever I do just need to store stuff I just use Postgres + PeeWee as my ORM. Always found it very simple and obvious to use (https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/). Good luck!
