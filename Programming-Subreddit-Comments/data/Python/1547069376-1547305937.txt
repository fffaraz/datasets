Omitting documentation, not using virtualenv, using csv instead of pandas, not using github. 
But you can say that about anything with python. You can open text files in notepad, so why open files in python to edit them? The answer is always because you can program the logic. You could use python to send videos from your computer over to it based on certain conditions. You could patch multiple systems together. Maybe you have a Django website that provides video links and you want to Chromecast something?
&gt; Using _inheritance_ -- especially multiple inheritance -- instead of _composition_. These aren't mutually exclusive though? Or am I confusing something? &gt; Ever using **reload**. What's the problem with reload? Some applications are unfortunately specced out such that they need live-reload capability and that's the only way I can think of to do that.
I feel like we dont see "inside" 2d bodies so much as its a matter of perspective. A 1d being could only "see" points because anything around it would either be before/after it on that 1 dimension. A 2d being could only "see" line segments We see 2d images
Looks cool! Very good for a first web app, very good indeed. 
&gt; I run Google Chrome. As one of my Chrome users I switched off Javascript, went to the YouTube site, and could not see anything. That's great but that's not what I did. There are addons that shut javascript off by default unless you opt-in for each domain. &gt; It makes sense, because you need Javascript for the Video Player controls to work. Sure. &gt; So I do maintain that YouTube requires Javascript. /r/technicallythetruth but irrelevant. &gt; Sorry if you trust Google more than you trust me. I trust their level of security as a corporation-I-have-heard-of vs. you, a complete-and-total-stranger I have no knowledge of. Let me reverse that: Would you prefer to run javascript from youtube (big bad Google, or to go even more ominous, *Alphabet*), or javascript that I had written? **Don't take it so hard** though, I don't trust my veterinarian office to keep my data safe. Hell I don't trust *Target* to keep my data safe. Google rises to the level of ubiquity that it becomes a necessary evil. Target and my vet's office - and *you* - do not. &gt; I assure you that they have a much larger infrastructure for profiting off your personal information than I could ever dream of. That's great, but that's **not** the issue. You could have simply included the URL to the video right in the post. Then whether or not I know you or trust you is irrelevant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6-nvgnlr9Y
Use `"` everywhere, unless you have a string which contains `"` or your string is at most either a single "string item" and an escape for that string item is what I use. Keeps me consistent when writing a C extension. [String items described here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals).

 Added support for MongoDB Atlas in PythonOnWheels. Pretty handy since you don't have to install mongoDB locally for small/test projects. Just a matter of minutes to go. I posted a short article about how it works: [working with PythonOnWheels and MongoDB Atlas](https://www.pythononwheels.org/article/5defb0af-dc7c-4d23-902f-6937c3852e6b/) 
I'm glad it helps!
And if the test has a docstring, the "-v" flag will display the first line in the output. You can use this to add a bit of context to the output.
I agree
And if the test has a docstring, the "-v" flag will display the first line in the output. You can use this to add a bit of context for the passed tests.
I would say use the latter and try to avoid deep imports. You can always do from dao import db as doa_db 
No, I don't think it would be practical 
Maybe not practical but is it possible?

I did PyCharm for awhile, but now I'm diggin VSCode. I'll do some more searching but I'll keep that in mind if I go back to PyCharm. Thank you!
They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that composition is usually a cleaner, more scalable, and more flexible pattern for building up a given interface than doing so via inheritance. As for **reload**, leaves things like global variables in strange states that require quite of care to keep straight. Most of the time not a problem, but _man_ can it lead to some strange and hard to diagnose bugs. For a true live-reload requirement it's the only choice and is fine if used with care, but I've seen it used far too often without that care and in cases where a fresh process would have been a far better choice.
A great way to start to understand this is to read the wonderful book ‘Flatland’ by Edwin E. Abbot 
I need group chats in incognito mode like Allo. Apparently secret chat is only allowed 1 to 1. Am I right? 
It'll also make you really appreciate Python. I've been spending a lot of time with C lately and coming back to python for a project is very refreshing. 
You should look at the Python Interviews book, it’s in a good bundle right now on HumbleBundle. Good luck!

Thank you for checking it out!
A group of web scrapers that generate lists of potential clients for our marketing department. For the longest time, they just google searched for the information and stopped when they got too tired or frustrated to look any more. I’m also trying to figure out how to catch a print out (over 300 pages per day) from banking software so that the bookkeeping department will stop wasting so much paper. Once I can catch it, I can do all of the sorting and pdf tricks needed; but the first problem is grabbing it before the printer does. It doesn’t prompt a ‘print page’ screen or anything. It’s part of the ‘joy’ of this software...
it's a 16-cell. you can find tesseract in the imgur album
I assume the term "virtual" causes confusing. The virtual environments I create for local development are all stored on my system too. Typically, I create 1 virtual environment per project and install all dependencies inside it. According to the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) a virtual environment is: &gt; a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.
agree
If you want some pointers I’m afraid you’ll need to learn c++ *knee slap* got ‘em! Yeah sorry just screen cap this and put it in r/comedy cemetery already. 
I’m thinking of doing something similar at my office but I’m not sure where to start. Where is your app going to reside and run from? Internal web? AWS?
I think it's fine if you're writing library code and debugging something. That's the intended use case, I imagine. I'd assume that the poster above was talking about using 'reload' actually in 'finished' code.
after "import importlib as imp" I will later write something like "imp.reload(module1); imp.reload(module2); imp.reload(module3)" or whatever things I often need reloaded into a single line. Then, using ctrl-shift-R to search the command history, it is just "ctrl-shift-R imp &lt;enter&gt;" to re-execute that line as needed. As much as possible I write my modules so that they can safely be re-executed without any strange behavior (which is good practice anyhow). The only subtle bugs I've run into this way is failing to reload as much as I thought I did.

Yeah i understand what a venv is. I intentionally don't use it at all, not even with pycharm doing most of the work. Every time I work on a different service or different version of a service, I just install the requirements from the requirements file.

I’m building a program that does my vocabulary hw for me (for Spanish and Psych). Although it is only somewhat more convenient than looking through the book, I feel like that convenience will motivate me to do the hw more often. I want to sell this to my classmates but nobody is convinced that it is at all more convenient than digging through the book.
Awesome! Thanks! I am very new to this as well as the Python language! I appreciate your quick response. 
This is less of an interrogative stance and far more just curiosity, but what do you mean by &gt; As for **reload**, leaves things like global variables in strange states that require quite of care to keep straight. I mean, yes, anything that you imported as a `from x import *` won't be updated when x is reloaded (however x.y will), but other than that I don't know what you're referring to.
our image detection is a rpi camera that is placed outside of the aquarium detecting through the transparent tank.
How large is your tank? If it's anything like [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupurbanfarm.files.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F04%2F100_1285.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupurbanfarm.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F04%2F18%2Ftilapia%2F&amp;docid=-OnCG6361i1AJM&amp;tbnid=3WRDnSfqqPMQ4M%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwjU96nTieLfAhXImuAKHXkCCQoQMwhWKAIwAg..i&amp;w=3968&amp;h=2976&amp;client=firefox-b-1&amp;bih=1824&amp;biw=980&amp;q=aquarium%20tank%20tilapia&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU96nTieLfAhXImuAKHXkCCQoQMwhWKAIwAg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8) Then _maybe_ it'll work if your have a tube +small pump circulating water from the bottom of the tank (usually coldest part), and wiring the cooling tube passing the rpi unit cpu. The problem is tilapia are not cold water fish. So not sure how effective that solution will be for you.

I don't think so. I don't do android dev but I think that you would be able to do this 
How are you finding it?
our tank is not that large almost on the average. do mean we will improvise a cooling system for our rpi?
I can also send my github profile if you wanna take a look? I only know Python though.
Yes
What's wrong with csv? I always go with standard lib if it doesn't add too much work.
Alright Private message me.

When you say incognito.. like hiding your name/info? Or no one would know you're in a channel or.. what? Assume I have no knowledge of Allo
Curious, what is the use case for a Spotipy wrapper?
Mainly with messages that disappear after a determined time. 
&gt;&gt;Apparently if there was a 4d being, they would be able to see inside our bodies, like we'd be able to see inside a 2d body. Not necessarily. It would depend on how the space is connected/in what way the "new" dimension couples to the others. (And additionally what kind of fields do or do not propagate in it.) We can be fairly sure of how the 3-D --&gt; 2-D example works because we understand three dimensions both intuitively, empirically, and mathematically. This allows us to demonstrate in several satisfactory ways what this reduction must be like. The case for spatial dimensions greater than 4 complicated things. We can solve certain special cases, which is no help with imagining but does mean if those special cases did exist we could make meaningful statements about how a time progression through it would work. Otherwise, we don't know for sure whether you would see anything unusual, should a 5-dimensional creature pass by you. We can say that in some cases you definitely would, and in some others you might not. (For example, the fact that gravity is excessively weak when compared against all other long-range forces has led to some speculation that a force of gravity that propagated through a not yet discovered extra dimension, might-- to us-- appear to be much weaker that it actually is, as it bleeds into this other dimension(s) as well as our own.) Now sometimes it is supposed that this new dimension is precisely like our own. Abitrarily close to being Euclidean, the same in every way as our usual dimensions, in which case we can make distinctions and predict effects such as you outline. But the fact that this dimension, should it exist, is or seems to be completely undetectable to us...suggests that it wouldn't be very like our normal dimensions at all. (Or else we would have presumably noticed them already.) Or maybe 4-D space-time lies on the back of a 5-D turtle, and it's turtles all the way down. 
Imo spotipy is not very good by itself. They do fine just actually getting you data but I think it could be more organized. . It gives you the raw response from the API so if you you have to dig through dictionaries to get the data you actually want, and all the functions all belong to one Spotify object so you have to search for the function you need. Further, authentication is confusing. You have to use 2 different types of authentication objects and pass one into the other.(Also it's been abandoned by repo owner basically) My version is a lot simpler IMO. I'm using objects so an artist is an object, a track is an object etc. If I want to see an artist albums I can do just this (after like 2 lines of authentication) example = artist.from_search("Radiohead") for album in example.get_catalog() : print(album.name) And there I got all there albums. Basically all the data you request is parsed for you. Plus I have extra features like it stores the artists you create so that you don't accidentally create artists twice. But mostly just everything is automatically put into an attribute instead of being nested deep in a dictionary. 
I wish I could make sense of hypercubes. Limited to 3D is lame.
Congrats, if the majority of the work will be catered around AWS make sure you have a good understanding of boto3.
Incredible! I was kind of frustrated with long long codes in c and c++, I must say Python programming language is too good as codes are short and many more functionalities that are yet to be discovered by me will be awesome.
If the app runs on an Android emulator you can use keyboard/mouse automation python libraries like PyAutoGui. Autohotkey is very good for this but it uses it's own (simple) language.
I'm glad to hear it! It's definitely a lot easier than other languages imo. Let me know if you need help with anything or need clarification on any concepts.
AWS Lambda based API for a mobile app. It's pretty cool.
Or just dao.db.func
For free? Just go to /r/learnpython
Not Python related (well only somewhat), but learn Terraform and Ansible there is a good chance you'll be using them.
Knowledge of a cloud-based architecture will be far more useful than knowledge of specific Python libraries. This is especially true since you're likely to be dealing with a lot of custom internal stuff that you can't prepare for. But you're an intern. They don't expect you to know much. Just do whatever interests you over the next four months, and enjoy this unstructured time while you have it. You'll be fine.
I'll give this a shot, thanks y'all! 
You can use OpenGL. Here's a book about Python, OpenGL and scientific visualization : http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl/
From [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload): &gt; When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module’s global variables) is retained. &gt;Redefinitions of names will override the old definitions, so this is generally not a problem. If the new version of a module does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old definition remains. This feature can be used to the module’s advantage if it maintains a global table or cache of objects — with a try statement it can test for the table’s presence and skip its initialization if desired: &gt; &gt; try: &gt; cache &gt; except NameError: &gt; cache = {} Basically **reload** has always had an issue in which globals (variables, functions, modules... any name in the module's global namespace) that have been removed or renamed in the module since the original import don't actually get removed from the module on reload. If you've removed a name from the modules globals, for instance by changing its imports, but failed to remove references to that name inside the locals of that module's functions, you can get some very subtle bugs. Other issues that have caused their own problems are documented a few paragraphs later: &gt; If a module imports objects from another module using from … import …, calling reload() for the other module does not redefine the objects imported from it — one way around this is to re-execute the from statement, another is to use import and qualified names (module.name) instead. &gt; &gt; If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances — they continue to use the old class definition. The same is true for derived classes. Basically **reload** can leave your code very subtly _wrong_ in ways that are excruciatingly hard to debug.
It's far slower for big files. Pandas is implemented in C so it has some tricks to do faster (parallel) calculations.

 Targets = { foo:1, bar:0, baz:1 } What you do with `'bar()':0` is add a string, not a function object. 
At the moment, I am rendering the React components onto a Django template using django-webpack-loader. However, later down the line I will utilize Django REST framework once I have further developed the models and views on the backend. As for a good tutorial, I think the documentaion for Django REST is a good starting point for building the API. As for using React, the tutorial below seems like a good introduction from what I can tell. [https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-react-tutorial/](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-react-tutorial/)
You also need a thread.join() so the thread will run to completion. import threading def foo(): print("foo was here") def bar(): print("bar was here") def baz(): print("baz was here") Targets = {foo: 1, bar: 0, baz: 1} for Loop, Enabled in Targets.items(): if Enabled == 1: print(" Starting up " + str(Loop)) print(" Enabled? " + str(Enabled)) thread = threading.Thread(target=Loop) thread.daemon = True thread.start() thread.join() else: print(" Skipping " + str(Loop))

thanks mate. I'll have a look !
I can't remember if `time.time()` is monotonic. If not, does this work if the clock gets adjusted?
Hey this is neat but you might want to take your API key out of the code - I might get rid of the lat long info too, so you're not doxxing yourself
/r/learnpython Can you `pip install` things which aren't `requests`? Do you have admin privileges over that directory?
Another option is to try make the command prompt run as administrator.

pip install requests --user
This is my sledgehammer approach to fixing python module installation issues 
Cool project! Thanks for sharing. For those like me who are not familiar with the ML applications to the biological sciences. What are the sort of tasks are ML being applied to on genetic code?
It isn't, there is `time.monotonic()` which should be used for monotonic time tracking.
Yes I have had it work before
I'm new to this what does that mean I should do?
I'll try that next
You should tweet this to the the real Onion just to see what they have to say. 
By default, pip installs to the system directory, which you may or may not have permission to do so. --user flag tells pip to install to the user directory. And in this case there is a big red text advising you to do that.
Someone's library has a bug then :-)
How are you executing it when it raises that error?
Also we are having problems with the codes that we're using. The accuracy is too low, it measures almost everything it sees
Python is written in such a way that only one thread at a time can do work (feed opcodes to the interpreter). This means that threads can only sleep at the same time (i.e. not do anything useful, just wait for something to wake them up). The situation when this can be useful are, for example: * Doing I/O. In this case, typically, a thread sends a request to the system to do I/O and has nothing to do until the response comes back. So, it makes sense to put it to sleep and try to wake it up later in hopes that the system already has a response. * Doing something with another process, for example, signaling a process and waiting for it to respond: there's nothing to do but sit and wait, so, it would make sense to put a thread to sleep. This is wasteful and stupid. The underlying system threads can actually do work in parallel, i.e. they can send code to a CPU and have it executed. But Python interpreter is very lame, when it comes to memory management. I guess, it was a toy project when it started, and it never matured... so, all memory allocations needed for object creation in Python assume they happen in the same thread (even though the underlying system facilities, like `malloc` are thread-safe!), so, if you were to actually try running Python code in multiple threads, it wouldn't work because of all kinds of race conditions in interpreter's memory heap, like, objects would partially overlap in memory, thus all kinds of basic operations on them, like moving the object pointer to a different register / calling a function with it etc. would result in memory segmentation / double free / other similar problems.
If you are planning to use OpenGL there is a much simpler wrapper library that I've found makes me much more productive: https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL. It has quite a few examples. It's also quite a bit faster than PyOpenGL (lower call overhead). I also have a project building on ModernGL with some more examples : https://github.com/Contraz/demosys-py/tree/master/examples. It has a very permissive license, so anything in there is free for grabs. 
Well for some reason half the code isn’t inside the damn thing
You _should_ be getting a SyntaxError, you can't declare a variable as **global** and assign to it in the same line.
Wdym
So then what is the first line in code? def shop(): global inventory = [""] tradetype = input[...] [... the rest of your code in shop ...] Or: def shop(): global inventory = [""] tradetype = input[...] [... the rest of your code in global ...] Or: def shop(): global inventory = [""] tradetype = input[...] [... the rest of your code in global ...] Basically without knowing the whole thing it's just guessing on my part, though all three of those are misusing **global**.
def shop(): global inventory Other stuff
You need to get that into the format correctly. To do so reliably put one line of text not indented, then a blank space... them indent every line of your code with 4 leading spaces Follow that with a blank line and then another sentence that isn't indented. If you're making **inventory** global within **shop** and it's not previously defined outside of **shop** then it's going to fail because you reference **inventory** before you ever call **shop**.
Ok thx
&gt; Like `eval` they can execute arbitrary code Erm the problem with eval is running it on code you don't control. f-strings can only be literals, so you can't ever encounter any of the issues with eval.
modernize: https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixers.html `modernize my_file.py` will replace `x.iterkeys()` with `six.keys(x)`, among other neccessary changes.
Stuffing way too much magic into __init__.py. Believing writing tests were always a waste of time. Using print instead of logging. 
Can I ask, _why_ are you using **global**? And repeating yourself so much?

Sound quality is very poor. Introduction portion is not good. Its confusing and does not define the concept of modules properly. 
you can use plotly in python, no understanding of JS required.
I'm prefer Django + drf for everything. 
Check bokeh from pydata!! Its uses D3 library and you can create interactive plots and dashboards with ease 
Always use a venv.
Interesting, how does the SMS sending work? Does gmail provide that service?
Glad you like it!
What you describe in your first example is, alone, incredibly useful for lots of use case. I probably wouldn't use Python (or more precisely the reference implementation since others may not suffer from this) for concurrency-heavy tasks, but that's really not a reason to call it a shitty language. All languages (yes, all !) have their warts you know...
On the coding front: `if time_now == (8, 30, 0)` may be prone to return False when you would expect True since the sleep(1) will sleep for one second, but the code will take an additional small amount of time to run. So it might not check exactly at (8, 30, 0), but instead at (8, 29, 59.999) and (8, 30, 1.0001). Might be better to check if time_now is in an interval (8, 30, 0) to (8, 35, 0), and then sleep for 5 minutes after that to make sure that you're outside it. 
Depends on the requirements. Django is heavily dependent on relational databases such as postgres or mysql (although you can use something else, but a lot of its features are tied to it, such as session and user management). I also recommend django because it has a lot of batteries included, and combined with Django Rest Framework, you can build APIs in days. Other alternatives you might consider: Pyramid, Flask (I understand that you are already using it), Tornado (useful for async flows, eg websockets), CherryPy (I avoid it when possible because of it's nasty url handling), Bottle (similar to flask), Sanic (similar to flask but it make use of the async features of python3.5+).

Agreed. It makes things fairly straight forward. Optionally go the graphql route..

Some clever coding there, but consider implementing that without using a thread. You could run the pruning process when you get or add a key.

Beat wishes to u! Read your post hope everything works out. I’m trying to webscrape myself. I use python and I’m almost there. Really trying to refine my list and dictionary mechanics as well as class usage and all the object stuff. I’m about a month in and it’s really been interesting. I plan on using python to webscrape information related to news, stocks, interests etc...and then be able to actually do something with the data. I like data visualization and found two pretty good ones for making infographics if you want to document your journey on it. My favorite one is visme and my second fav is infogram. They have really cool things in there. I agree with you about the GUI thing. You can make a solid program without all the bells and whistles. I still don’t have the skill set to import GUI and make sense of it yet. But it’s in the works. Take care

I was working on integrating [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) as an engine into [GuardRails](https://github.com/apps/guardrails). Just shipped it a few hours ago!
Why are you installing it into "microsoft visual studio"?.. This isn't even a Microsoft Visual Studio directory... it's just a directory you created and named that way :/ but why? Why are you living in 21st century and installing something under "Program Files (x86)"? Every time you do this, an angel cries in heaven... Not to mention the bloody tearshed it has every time someone launches MS Windows. So, I'd imagine, you installed 32-bit version of Python, for Windows, into a directory with an extremely misleading name in a very bad place in your system. Well, short of removing MS Windows and installing a decent OS, what you can do is: 1. Make sure the "microsoft visual studio" directory actually exists (you didn't delete it by accident), and that it is writable. When Windows reports that you don't have access to something it doesn't necessary mean that you don't have access due to insufficient permissions, it could be because there's nothing to be accessed. 2. Make sure your user does indeed have access to this directory: that it isn't in read-only mode, that in special permissions, your user has all checkboxes ticked (you can do it by invoking context menu on the directory in question, and examining its properties). 3. Uninstall the Python you have, and install a 64-bit version. Put it in a directory on a drive not managed by your system utilities, e.g. if you installed MS Windows to `C:\Windows`, and you have more volumes, like, `D:` for example, create directory called `D:\bin\Python` and install Python there. Avoid using `Program Files` like a plague. Don't install anything there, it's a bad idea: MS Windows' system utilities like to randomly make this directory or the whole volume read-only, which will often break things. 4. Once you have a 21st century version of Python in a place you have more control over, you can go on installing third-party packages in a little bit saner way.
This isn't my niche, but it seems like some keywords you might want to look for are "edge detection" and "image segmentation" Once you've detected the edges and segmented the image into however many pieces there are (with every black piece being treated as one object) then you can locate any one of these unique pieces just looked online and found https://pinetools.com/image-edge-detection which seems to suggest Roberts cross edge-detect (initially proposed by Lawrence Roberts), Sobel edge-detect (Sobel-Feldman operator) or Laplacian edge-detect as initial starting points for your journey. Once you've got that, I'm not sure what the next part you're saying is. How is image number one supposed to correlate to image number two?

I follow the erlang method: `"` is for human-readable text (which often contains apostrophes so that's convenient) and `'` is for programmatic symbols.
This is a very interesting challenge. I agree with u/[DefNotaZombie](https://www.reddit.com/user/DefNotaZombie) that edge detection is likely a good starting point, but this is a much more complex problem than that imo. Correct me if im wrong but after a quick scan of the wikipedia page on microstructures it seems to me that the question is not just asking you to "find the differences" but instead to identify certain patterns within the images and count the number of distinct occurrences. This would require much more than just simple difference identification. Do you have any further information on what the requirements fully entail? ie an example of input/output
have you tried running it as administrator?
Every time I think I have a handle on what is happening, it fucks with me more. I love it.
Debug markers are on the left, they're talking about the "error" notifications in the right margin. /u/aeonflux123456 hovering the marker should tell you why pycharm takes issue with the thing, you can click it to jump straight to the line.

Wow there’s acctually someone else who studies microstructure 😮
The main person you are writing documentation for, is Future You. you know, that guy who will come around in six months time, read your code and ask to himself, "What the flying feck was I doing here?" You want him to say, "Oh, right. Yeah, that works. That's ok. Yeah, I understand." Future You, a hopefully better and more code-critical version of Present You. You want him to be proud of Present You. 
Not sure if youre joking or not but I feel like that answer has become the catch-all solution when presented with a problem that is beyond their realm of expertise. Thats not to say that they might not apply in this case, I'm just saying that you would need to have a bit more information on the subject before both determining it is a viable option and being able to successfully implement one.
Sweet.
I was just reading about them to get a better grasp of OP's question. It sounds like a very interesting topic that could really have an impact on our technology especially given the explosion of 3d printing and other material manufacturing techniques in recent years.

I've done a couple of image processing projects so far on my course, I would say that neural networks are probably the most accurate but also most complicated method (but I don't have much experience there) I would start by segmenting the image, which typically involves some form of edge detection, as others have suggested. Then you should have an image in which each object has a clearly defined border. What you then want to do is define properties of the objects (total area, bounding box, etc.) and see whether they are different for the two images you're trying to differentiate. If they are, you can set a threshold - if the area is bigger than X, then the image is classified as Y. I'm only a beginner with this stuff but from my experience that's how I'd start.
When printing it always prints out while seconds, and during testing this method worked fine. But I’ll keep this in mind if I don’t get a text, Thanks!
Thanks! I almost forgot to take out my email and password too. 
do it earlier - like 8th std.. Schools these days are miserable - comp sci classes have students doing Word and Powerpoint :((... at least it was better in my days where they started wtih Logo and GWBasic.

You should be able to use it... I think that rates will still apply (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
You had some answer about method (edge detection, segmentation). You will find these tools into scikit-image, PIL and opencv. For the neural network part, you will need a "large" dataset of labeled inputs, which is a strong assumption... But if you have such thing, take a look into keras (and I guess CNN) . Be aware that more you inject expert knowledge, less huge have to be your input dataset, but you risk to overconstraint your problem and miss some interesting hidden behavior.
Your example would block the loop and not start the other threads until the started thread is finished as the join method is inside the loop body. What you can do is: threads = [threading.Thread(target=f) for f, enabled in Targets.items() if enabled] for t in threads: t.daemon = True t.start() [t.join() for t in threads]
You could make a little yaml config file to hold all those sensitive bits rather than having it hard coded. Keep the yaml out of version control but read and parse it at the top of your script.
Make sure to at least include a placeholder yaml file that other can simply fill out. 
Do you mind expanding on this point? I don't really understand what you mean - I don't see the problem with f-strings.

A bit of googling reveals [`poliastro`](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/examples/Plotting%20in%203D.html) has a 3D plotting module. Is this what you're looking for?

It sounds like you're classification is off then. What are you using for tilapia detection? Guessing you guys are using DNN? Reason is any simpler (non ML) solutions requires some insight in the fields, and it sounds like you're new to most of this. 
For many things DNN are suggested when much easier solutions exist but for image classification they are the right answer for serious applications. For text, sound and images there is no competition anymore. 
A full explanation of [gettext internationalization](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/gettext.html) is too long to go into here, but it boils down to installing a function `_` that is used to mark strings for translation: _("Some UI String!") Once all such strings in your program are marked up the utilities associated with **gettext** can create the necessary files that are used to translate a given original string to its localized version in another language. This is obviously trivial with a string that has no variable component, but **gettext** has specialized logic for both _printf_ and **str.format** style syntaxes: _("This %s works") % foo _("This {} works").format(foo) These work because the `_` function will return the locale-translated string with the replacement token still within it. The **str.format** version adds some interesting problems here because tokens can contain keywords and those keywords can't be translated, but for the most part there are workarounds. The _f-string_ however wouldn't work because `_(f"This {foo} works!")` evaluates the f-string _before_ the **gettext** function can ever be called... your translator would need to provide a translation for every conceivable value or **foo**. Haven't seen anyone come up with a sensible workaround for this, as you'd need to somehow interrupt the compilation of the string token itself... so for the foreseeable future f-strings are not the right choice for any string that requires internationalization.
I agree. I should have qualified that statement by saying that it might not be necessary to "Roll your own" DNN. In this case just using the available CV tools that exist, such as OpenCV, could suffice. Those are obviously trained DNN but don't actually require any knowledge of DNN to utilize.
Cool :)
But youre right. In my head I immediately thought of OpenCV as the primary tool for solving this and which I know is a DNN. I had just read the comment as suggesting OP to develop a DNN not simply utilize one. That was probably my mistake.
I tried bokeh, seaborn, dash(plotly) for several visualization project. And my best was dash. You don't have to know javascript and it can easily go-live from your toy project whenever you want. And scalability is also good. Highly recommend.
A more modern and robust way to handle date/times. I pretty much always `pip install arrow`. Also, docopt is vastly superior to argparse. Sure, these are a simple pull from PyPI, but having them in the standard library would help codify and popularize the conventions.

When you day stacking you mean averaging relative pixels of lights/darks/bias/flats? Or a series of pre-processed lights?
I see - yeah, in general wherever you need delayed formatting, you need to use `str.format()`. Another example is storing strings with variable components in a config file and then importing them for usage in a different script. Because the variable doesn't exist at the point the string is defined, you can't use f-strings, you need to use `str.format()`. Nevertheless, I still prefer f-strings for all other cases where delayed formatting is not required.
Sure, they're ideal for all the cases that don't involve human UI that might need localization.
Hi! So as in all good open source solutions, the government, the military, and academia have all recognized that basically every mat sci student does this at one point in their career.

Thing it's not even 1.5 years old yet. My dad just found an acer es15 ES1 533 for sale in Walmart, and bought it. It runs like crap and I've always kinda ignored it. I don't *absolutely* need it but it's really satisfying to fix things for me. Especially something as expensive as a laptop. I don't know why but I really love getting the best of things, like I know most people do but I've been thinking about fixing this laptop for days now and it makes me giddy. Might be some form of autism but idk. 
First my app to calibrates the lights and then my app is stacking calibrated lights 
Do arrow come with its own time zone database? If so, it cannot be in the stdlib because of frequent and sometimes unpredictable updates. The pytz package isn't in stdlib for that very reason.

The answer is likely [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).
I want some kind of simple non blocking input that's all I ask. 
Traditional approach: The differences look like grain size and complexity of edge. The one on the left has this Voronoi diagram look to it. Maybe you could highlight the intersection points with [ORB](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_orb.html). You'd have a dense cloud on the right and thin cloud of points on the left. The heuristic of 'how many points' might be enough to separate them. Then maybe [GLCM](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_glcm.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-features-detection-plot-glcm-py) or something to convert the points into a feature vector and then a classifier like [XGB](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) or [something](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html). Alternatively, just tune a pretrained deep net using [fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/wiki-lesson-2/9399) or [keras](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html). https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/08/deep-learning-part-2.html

What happens if I delete a file in the source dir? You might take a look at the venerable [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync). I have no idea if it works on Windows, but just looking at the options will give you a hint about other cases you might need to check.
**Rsync** rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files across computer systems, by checking the timestamp and size of files. It is commonly found on Unix-like systems and functions as both a file synchronization and file transfer program. The rsync algorithm is a type of delta encoding, and is used for minimizing network usage. Zlib may be used for additional data compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for data security. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

&gt;....after I put my first project on reddit and had others look at it I realized I needed to learn how to take criticism. As one progresses throughout a career in software, feedback is one of the more important aspects of not only the code you write but how you collaborate with others - IMO. I think you're taking a great step towards maturity in identifying you must listen to others however, I do think it's a mistake to label this as 'criticism'. Pursuing(and providing) empathetic feedback is a great way to improve as a software developer and I wish there was more emphasis on this skill in CS education. People are the hardest part of working in software as there is no place for personal pride([don't be an asshole](http://scottberkun.com/2007/asshole-driven-development/)). Everyone is entitled to an opinion, it's up to you to interpret that feedback as a benefit - not a criticism. ;)
I assume you mean AI? As this is a relatively new area, I think there is not stage library yet, many are still in development.
this is just the beginning of cool projects. More amazing projects will come in the next two years ...
Same thought here. Regardless of interpretation you have a valid point on it becoming a catch-all!
That looks like a cool project. You might not want to sound so much like an ad bot though. I almost wrote this off as just an advertising stunt. Glad I decided to actually check it out.
The book Violent Python is really good for getting into cybersecurity though Python as well, for anybody looking at this :).
I agree with the segmentation steps. You might also get some value from labelling the particles. My solution is in the ``paricle_labels`` function: https://github.com/canismarko/xanespy/blob/master/xanespy/xanes_math.py Then you can also use scikit-image region_props() to get stats for all the regions, like size, orientation, etc.
/r/learnoython to find out why that's not a recommended approach.
Someone kind to make a pull request with this under Educational in Books, Articles, Guides &amp; Talks? :-)

Hmm, I'm not quite sure what Oython is.
Despite being possible, this is NOT recommended. The /r/learnpython subreddit and r/Python Discord can give some more details. Yes, you can have a core.py file like this: import os import sys import ... and then `from core import *`, but it's not considered good practice. 
TIL There are people who have been able to actually use Google Pay. &amp;#x200B; The output of this is really cool. I wonder what you might be able to infer if you were to overlay this with your google maps "where have I been" stuff. Might be interesting to see some odd trend like, "after I visit my mother, I feel like getting a cupcake" type stuff.
Really interesting article! [I recently started working with Google Takeout data.](https://github.com/Renmn/Gmplot-with-Google-Location-Data) I wrote a couple of functions that converts your location data in json format to a pandas dataframe then uses the gmplot module to plot it onto a Google Map. I've almost finished it just needs some tweaks to make the plots look better. The plots in this article look great, a lot better than gmplot at least
Basically decompose the image into a really long series of rgb. Each pixel is a data point that has a geography. One should be able to determine the difference based on frequency or relative size of white black transitions. And the relative size of black or white regions. I'm assuming you aren't just trying to do this for two images but a bunch of similar images
This is awesome. Good work
Ok, so now all your modules depend on core, which means that 1. without the core module, nothing can run 2. core will become a catch all for everything that is commonly used, and will grow without control 3. reading a given module, you will not know what exactly, of the tens of imports in core, are actually used. That said, here are two mantras of programming: - if you can technically do something, it does not mean it's a good idea to do it. - code is not only for machines. it's for humans first. There's a lot of important communication that is tailored at humans when you write code. From indentation to even line breaks among groups of lines. Leave this layer of information out, or have it inconsistent or with poor signal/noise ratio and you are hurting development. 
I am well aware that it's not considered a good practice. It is a conscious decision, with intention of making it harder to read code before obfuscating it even further and to help hide the licensing system. So most of the 'cons' become 'pros' to me. '[core.py](https://core.py)' file is also my own, and it won't have anything i DONT want to import. &amp;#x200B; The only thing I'm not sure if using \`import os\` in just 1 file and then referring to it by the 'star' import is any faster than using \`import os\` 243 times in each of the modules and files individually?

Very cool! I pretty much never make anything visual in Python so I'm always seeing neat things people make and being jealous that they took the time to learn whatever it is they're showing off. &amp;#x200B; One note with your code that only sticks out to me because of years of code reviews: You use lots of \`camelCase\` variable and function names. The Python community recommends in PEP-8 to use \`snake\_case\` variable and function names.

I didn't mention anything about a "problem with eval". That is irrelevant to my comment. If I said "Functions aren't strings, they are executable code, and like `eval` they can execute arbitrary code and have side-effects" would you think it was the tiniest bit relevant that `eval` can be called on user-supplied untrusted strings but functions have to be pre-defined in source code? No of course not. But if you still want to argue that f-strings are strings, not code, then perhaps you might try explaining the disassembly of an f-string: # Python 3.8a py&gt; dis.dis("f'{[x*2 for x in range(3)]}'") 1 0 LOAD_CONST 0 (&lt;code object &lt;listcomp&gt; at 0xb78d4b88, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 1&gt;) 2 LOAD_CONST 1 ('&lt;listcomp&gt;') 4 MAKE_FUNCTION 0 6 LOAD_NAME 0 (range) 8 LOAD_CONST 2 (3) 10 CALL_FUNCTION 1 12 GET_ITER 14 CALL_FUNCTION 1 16 FORMAT_VALUE 0 18 RETURN_VALUE Disassembly of &lt;code object &lt;listcomp&gt; at 0xb78d4b88, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 1&gt;: 1 0 BUILD_LIST 0 2 LOAD_FAST 0 (.0) &gt;&gt; 4 FOR_ITER 12 (to 18) 6 STORE_FAST 1 (x) 8 LOAD_FAST 1 (x) 10 LOAD_CONST 0 (2) 12 BINARY_MULTIPLY 14 LIST_APPEND 2 16 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 4 &gt;&gt; 18 RETURN_VALUE

How is this different and/or better than [`functools.lru_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache)?
1. 90% of my modules use stuff that is in the core module. Core module contains only most common paths, config file data and imports of python standard modules 2. No, it won't, why would it grow if I only place standard module imports into it, a reference to main config file and a few variables which are generated at start of the program and then used by almost every other module? 3. Maybe, but not that I care about which of standard modules are used I'm the only developer of the tool. Some of the customers may decide to do some occasional debugging on site, but that is uncommon and I doubt that moving out standard libraries imports into one file will hurt it much.
Wait. So you know that there is a formatting problem but you post it anyway?

Cool skill
Here are some notes. Hopefully you'll find them useful: 1. Prefer snake\_case to camelCase, per PEP 8. But prefer the style of an existing module. 2. `file` is fair game in Python 3, but it ruffles my Python 2 feathers a bit. I usually use `fp` for file pointer. But I'm old and confused... :-) 3. You can just `paymentHtml.pop(0)`, no need to assign it to a throwaway variable. 4. I would probably write the chained methods like this: &amp;#8203; # I find this easier to read and maintain... date, time = (payment .select('.mdl-typography--body-1')[0] .get_text()[29:] .split(',') ) 5. Bare `except:` statements will bite you eventually. But acceptable in this use case... All in all very nice. No glaring issues for me...

&gt; 90% of my modules use stuff that is in the core module. Core module contains only most common paths, config file data and imports of python standard modules. Consider it a config module. It is not a config module. It's a catch all import module that brings different entities together within the same namespace for no reason and no communication of intent. &gt; Like a config.py. It is literally loaded in 90-95% of other modules. For one it contains a path to current app's directory which is commonly used. why would you hardcode that path? that thing becomes completely non relocatable. It's the most egregious bad idea ever. &gt; No, it won't, why would it grow if I only place standard module imports into it Because things with unclear names always end up becoming catch alls. You don't know where to put it, it will go there. This happens with things named like core, utils, and common. &gt; a reference to main config file and a few variables which are generated at start of the program and then used by almost every other module? Stuff like common paths, machine uuid, operating system, etc. Why would you aggregate imports with settings? Why would you put settings together with constants. Why would you put settings in an include instead of a settings file? &gt; Maybe, but not that I care about which of standard modules are used by looking at imports of a specific file. Ah yes, the old "it was hard to write, it must be hard to read" adage. &gt; I'm the only developer of the tool. And you will remain so, if you write code like this. &gt; Some of the customers may decide to do some occasional debugging on site, but that is uncommon and I doubt that moving out standard libraries imports into one file will hurt it much. it's not for customers. It's for developer sanity, self documentation, and proper coding practices. &gt; Are there any other reasons why this might be a bad idea? because it sucks. But you are free to name all your variables in hungarian notation, name your routines in japanese and have them do side effects completely unrelated to their name. But it's not a good idea either. What can I say? good luck when it eventually you pile up bad practice over bad practice. The problem is that then you end up teaching these bad practices to others, and then when they come work for me I have to bash my head against the wall because the code is an entangled mess and we are two days from the deadline.
You are puzzled that decoding ssl traffic is harder to do than non encrypted traffic? Not only is https traffic slower to deal with due to the way the ssl needs to be negotiated, but it also needs more cpu cycles to just decode the payload itself. You might be able to put a separate machine in front of your box decoding the https to http and just offloading all that extra work. Also, your cpu might be bad at doing decryption (some versions of cpu are less capable than others), and you might want to take a look at using http2 libs if possible as those connections incur a smaller round-trip overhead over regular http 1, or http1.1 ssl.

This might be too much information but I work in materials science and spend a lot of time analyzing microstructures, so I thought I would chime in with some thoughts. The general goal here from a practical stand point would be to extract properties of each phase in the microstructure like area fraction of each phase (or volume fraction if certain assumptions can be made), precipitate shape which would describe the deformation/strain characteristics of the microstructure and how it responded to load (if present), does any phase exist on the grain boundary indicating that phase is nucleating on grain boundaries (could be annealing), and perhaps more. I see there would be two important features to extract: grain boundaries and the grains themselves, where the grains themselves are more important. As already said the grain boundaries can be approximated with edge detection algorithms, and in microscopy/diffraction sciences the hough transform is really popular for this. The ease of extracting the grain boundaries is going to depend a lot on how the microstructure image was acquired. Extracting the grains themselves is usually done with histogram segmentation. For a two phase microstructure this just a simple threshold. For more than two phases you will have to look for multiple peaks in the histogram to window, and each peak should correspond to different phase, producing a mask for each phase. You could combine this mask with the edges from the edge detection to computationally isolate each grain from each phase. A proper metallographic polished/etched specimen should exhibit dark contrast at the grain boundaries in optical microscopy making edge detection easy, but it will be difficult to differentiate different phases since the contrast in each grain depends on phase and crystallographic orientation - the histogram segmentation will not work well (probably). For SEM or TEM microscopy this depends on the detector. Detectors that produce a z-contrast (atomic number, such as back scatter in SEM or HAADF-STEM in TEM) work the best at differentiating grains as each phase will appear at roughly the same intensity in the image, but you may lose some contrast of the grain boundaries (but if my experience not that much). Secondary electron detectors like the ETD or TLD in SEM will give similar results as optical microscopy.
I expected it to take longer and use more CPU, but I went from using 20% CPU to 600% and requests taking +3-4 seconds. &amp;#x200B; Seems a bit excessive especially because doing the same requests in another language is fine.
- More unit testing support. There are steps in the right direction (e.g. with the inclusion of mock), but some utilities such as the one in testfixtures module should really be default standard library. Also I would like to see PEP8 compliant assert methods. - Better, simpler path handling. - simple high level function download() to download via http (although I think python 3 maybe has it?) - hardware abstraction layer to access basic information about the machine. Connected USB ports, wifi available or not, monitors attached. - psutils. 
this is amazing. thank you for sharing this!

&gt; close to real time In Python? That's like dividing by zero... you even make system calls and memory allocation when doing `2 + 2`, what real time are you talking about? &gt; Would this translate well to Python and Asyncio at all? Nope. If the thread / process that runs the loop is stuck, it will not tell you anything. But even if it could, the only thing you could do to deal with the problem is to kill the process, so, not very useful anyways. Bottom line, if you need that kind of guarantee, cooperative concurrency is not the right framework to use. I.e. either you bite the bullet and accept that sometimes it will block for indefinite amount of time, and performance will sink, or you go with preemtpive model. Some cooperative models, like the one in Go, offer a better level of control than what Python offers, so you would be a lot less likely to run into problems like the ones you describe, but you wouldn't be able to eliminate them entirely. You'd have the same problem in Erlang too, but bettr tools for dealing with it. Python offers no tools for dealing with this kind of stuff.
I have a somewhat different proposition. The differences seemed to be mainly in the size and density of the pattern. So instead of trying to directly extract and classify the regions, maybe apply a frequency transform (DFT) if the pattern of each image is homogeneous (of one phase) or frequency-space transform (DWT) if the pattern can be a combination of multiple phases. Than apply some simple statistics or machine learning to identify the phases.
How would that work? Would you prefer polling or callback interface? 
Quality post. To the top!

&gt; Better, simpler path handling. pathlib?
Yeah it sounds strange. Which other languages have you tested? One solution might be to search for a https decryption library like fast-https.py, fast-request.py, etc ( I made that one up). Another one would be to write the request code in a language like C, C++, rust (really anything that can be called from python and is faster) The easiest solution (I should have really written that one first) is to try out [pypy](https://pypy.org). I got yesterday a script from 5seconds down to 0.6Seconds.

&gt; but that's really not a reason to call it a shitty language You missed the word. The word is "only". This is not the *only* reason to call Python a shitty language. There are thousands. But you are just stupid really. Saying that all X have problems, therefore any of X is just as good is essentially saying that: "all health problems are bad, therefor cancer is just as bad as sore throat". Python is cancer, it's not a sore throat.
PyPy is a good idea actually. I tried in C# and I even made the request in PHP, it was a lot faster. Which lead me to believe it's Python. I don't even need the output of the request, I literally just need the status code and to know it was a 200. Anything else and I kill the thread.

Yes. I thought it was a separate distribution. Unfortunately I am still dealing with py27 here.
Since this got kind of personal - Please, do not judge a person based just on the questions he (me) asks, especially on reddit. My questions are partially provocative on purpose. The fact that I'm talking about **refactoring** implies that I've been writing my code the other way - importing everything in each individual module, and separating everything. I know the rules, I follow them. The only time I ever use 'star' import is when importing QT libraries in Maya projects, and only because I have to make my code easily switchable between PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide, PySide2. I am cringing myself each time I do that. &amp;#x200B; It is sometimes a good idea to question the rules. And there's an old saying "rules are there to be broken". &amp;#x200B; I would never even think about such a refactor if I did not see this kind of coding in quite a few commercial projects. Namely I'm talking about Maya plugins, and a few TDs projects' from large and respectable studios. And they use this kind of importing quite often. This is what made me question it. I wonder why that is. There must be a reason other than "they just don't know that they are doing it wrong". Or maybe it is the only reason. &amp;#x200B; And again - I was partially looking at this measure of making my code harder to read on purpose as part of it's obfuscation. To make it harder for anyone who'd try to crack licensing system to understand which module is used where. That's why I asked if there's such a tool that could do that. &amp;#x200B; \------- &amp;#x200B; As for quotes: &gt; It is not a config module. It's a catch all import module that brings different entities together within the same namespace for no reason and no communication of intent. You are right, I was just talking about using this same module for importing standard libraries, since it's imported almost everywhere anyway. &amp;#x200B; &gt; why would you hardcode that path? that thing becomes completely non relocatable. It's the most egregious bad idea ever. I never said it's hard coded. These paths are generated based on user's environment: OS, Host software version, config parameters, and other variables. I decided that generating them once on project import is better than creating a functino that would generate it each time it's called. It would require IO and processing on each call. Granted it's not much, but still. &amp;#x200B; &gt; And you will remain so, if you write code like this. This.. is just a bit too personal. I suppose I responded to this in the main body of this post. &amp;#x200B; &gt; it's not for customers. It's for developer sanity, self documentation, and proper coding practices. Or maybe insanity of other people trying to reverse your code? :D &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Because it's a plugin for Maya. I'm not sure if it's possible to use cython in Maya. And even if it is, do I have to ship compiled binaries? If so then I will have to ship binaries for 3 OSes and 3-5 different versions of the host program. &amp;#x200B; With normal python same files just work with all versions of the host software.
This might not solve the problem completely as that sound quite extreme, but I would definitely recommend it even if you weren't using https. Use keep-alive in your connections if at all possible (if your process(ses) are long lived.) In the case of https, this saves you roundtrips reducing latency and more importantly the initial negotiation, which can be quite cpu-intensive. You mentioned using requests, check out requests.Session. Create a session using `ses = request.session()` and then use the same session to initiate the requests: `ses.post(url, params)`. Note: possible cookies persist in the session, which might or might be relevant in your use case. You also get connection pooling and other nice goodies :) 
Because that is the standard in which 99% of standard libraries are written and like 85% of other packages. Consistency.
Can we see some of your code?
Yeah, I was using this to start with and I saw no benefits at all lol - I've put it back in and will try to mess with it, see what I can do :D 
&gt; I am well aware that it's not considered a good practice. It is a conscious decision, partially with intention of making it harder to read code before obfuscating it even further and to help hide the licensing system. So most of the 'cons' become 'pros' to me. I am also aware that any python code can be reverse engineered, but the harder it is the better in my case. If you want to obfuscate, and can't use cx_freeze or other options, I think you would be better off by concatenating all your source files into one, and replace all identifiers with random strings of unicode glyohs. I read your other comments such that you have a decent source tree to work on, and then somehow mogrify it for distribution. Using the ast module, you should be able to obscurify it reasonably easy.
Thanks, is there anywhere I can read about how I could bring everything into one file? Or some example or maybe ready solutions? I actually thought about it before but completely disregarded this idea due to it's technical difficulty (or so I thought). As a matter of fact it would not only make it harder to 'decode' it, it could also make it much easier to install and use for an average user. &amp;#x200B; I found a lot of different python obfuscators but not one of them offers combining the whole project into one file. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

&gt; girlfriend baked a cake with the python logo New goals... Also thumbs up for your "submit text" suggestion
this is a great idea. my biggest problem when i was learning to program was that i had no ideas or problems to solve to practice.
Yes, gamification is the answer. Also the subreddit just looks boring, put up a custom banner and logo!
That's a better way to look at it. I guess criticism does come with some negative connotations. Thanks:) I'll try to look at it more like that! 
Haha sorry. Probably been spending way too much time coding and not enough time around people lately. Good thing my job isn't in marketing... Glad you thought it worth checking out! 
Nice, what resources are you finding helpful? I want to get started with Lambdas
Yeah, I'm hoping I can look back at myself in the future and feel good about my growth. I think the community for python is really helpful and has definitely made it easy to learn and grow
I'm a pipe TD. What are you trying to do with Maya?
The chrome developer tools can be very helpful for testing CSS code e.g. [https://youtu.be/ZAD7EcdhNqw?t=145](https://youtu.be/ZAD7EcdhNqw?t=145)
Yeah, that's the real issue. Very few locations I have found have the ability to do it. So, I have never once been able to use it. But, Google loves to ask me about using and why/why not.
Congratulations :) Here's some syntax tips: \- use 4 spaces for indentation \- don't use global variables (MAX\_BACKUP) instead you could define this at the top of the script (outside the scope of any function) \- instead of writing e.g. backup + " created." it's better to use string formatting e.g. "{} created".format(backup) \- use a main function for all the stuff that gets executed on runtime: def main(): # Start backups for pool in zfs: add_snap(pool) if __name__ == '__main__': main() &amp;#x200B;
Playing with the [altair library](https://altair-viz.github.io) for interactive visualizations. It's awesome .. e.g. [https://tagto.org/dataviz/crypto-monetary-base/](https://tagto.org/dataviz/crypto-monetary-base/) source: [https://github.com/agalea91/crypto-monetary-base/blob/master/jupyter-notebooks/crypto-multi-line-toolip-altair.ipynb](https://github.com/agalea91/crypto-monetary-base/blob/master/jupyter-notebooks/crypto-multi-line-toolip-altair.ipynb)
I'm just considering where to go next with my BroDynamics plugin\\script. Doing some research on what kind of refactoring I need to make it better and considering ways of obfuscating it's code to implement more licensing options and license locking. And whether I need\\want it in the first place. &amp;#x200B; I just recently found out that Alan Camilo released his animBot and made it a commercial-only plugin with no free version, just trial. It looks to be fairly popular, and people seem to like it. Got curious how he protected it, checked it's code out, it has multiple layers of obfuscation and it's really hard to figure out how to break it's licensing system at the first glance. With more time it can probably be possible, but it's more than enough to make people question whether they want to spend this time on cracking it in the first place.
Thanks, mate, they indeed are :). I managed to fix my biggest headache today: I want to have the content centered in the browser window. But depending on the amount of content the center was moving either left or right a tiny amount. I could not for the life of me understand what was going on. Well, turns out when a vertical scrollbar is displayed by the browser, the scrollbar's width will be subtracted from the window width, moving the center of the X-axis to the left. I felt pretty stupid when I finally figured out what was happening. Learn something new every day :). 
Looking forward to it! 
Ya I understand that. Out of curiosity are you just a developer or do you have domain knowledge in the science part as well?
Haha I can picture that.. tweaking little CSS issues has cost many hours of my life as well
Can I just point out how great your writing is. The explanations of every piece of this are super clear. Please do more tutorials. It's rare to find such clear explanations. 
Wow! For me the square is in the bottom left corner and I can't move it out! How did you did it? 
600% cpu? what's the cpu doing? Is it stuck in wait? Dunno about python or requests, but sometimes running out of entropy can effect things. When under load what is \`cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy\_avail\`?
Funny, around me all places that use Apple Pay also use Google Pay. Unfortunately it's still not nearly enough.

That's awesome, thanks for sharing 
Yes, I guess the data researchers took Spanish language tweets from some US cities. And many of those tweets included English words , because of the way many Latino people talk/write. It is a reflection of the mixed language vocabularies of Hispanic speakers in the US. Thanks for the feedback.

&gt; instead of writing e.g. backup + " created." it's better to use string formatting e.g. "{} created".format(backup) i'll have to look into that, what exactly is happening here? {} is just a place holder similar to %s in a printf?
It's not faster as importing a module registers it in sys.modules, making it instantly accessible. I'm not sure if importing it from core makes it slower than importing normally, but I think it might.
Now I know where not to try to rob people 
In 4 I would suggest defining new method that does it and naming it descriptively as this code is unreadable. Or split it into steps with meaningful variable names along the way.
Thanks, I have been working with boto3 a bit over the past couple months and will definitely spend more time on it now. 
Thanks for this comment. I’ve also been very interested in swift lately and was concerned I should be spending as much time with it. Would you think spending some time taking a class on AWS certs would be beneficial?
Thanks for the specific package names. I’ll definitely take a look at these two. 
Haha I’ll let you know at the end of the summer. I’d imagine it’s probably not so vital hardware, but what do I know 🤷🏽‍♂️
mpi4py exists. It's a wrapper on C's MPI. It lets you pass numpy arrays between processes. It's... adequate. For simple things. But its not great. Its run by just one guy, and while he's good, there just isnt enough maintenance or development to make it production-ready for anything but the simplest tasks. But i know a lot of astrophysics researchers use it. So its definitely useful for some things. 
There's a lot of value in having every developer use the same libraries. It significantly improves the consistency of the entire ecosystem.
YAML parser should be in standard library by now IMO. It's a slow evolution, widely used standard like JSON or XML. &amp;#x200B; Requests would also be nice to have that high level of web interaction, but I can understand why it could be better to keep separate.

what ciphers your client uses? maybe it picks non cpu assisted ones? maybe it's pure python aes or something? i mean http doesn't use any encryption at all... does your cpu support aes-ni? try upgrading your pyopenssl and requests using pip

Some people live to be dramatic, I think.
You're a funny person.
So do you actually want them to code something on the spot or show a demo? Because as a demo I'd take something with interesting visuals like an animated Mandelbrot set or something. I don't really see the value in coding something on the spot since the kids already have to have the basics down and I doubt there's much they could learn in those 15 minutes or so. Imo it would be better to show them something that looks really cool or complex but isn't really much code. A small pygame presentation could also be nice for kids because they see "ooh I can program games with that"
A kind of "Guess my number" game? They select a number between 0 and 100, and a binary search algorithm try to guess it. It's a simple algorithm, intuitif to explain why binary search is a good way to play that game optimaly but probably challenging enough for that purpose. 
I think both questions have been answered many times ;) Reddit or a search engine should refirect you to good Reddit / stackoverflow / quora answers :)
If you want an interactive demo, do something with pygame and drawing out shapes have a base class they can use and let them go to town drawing stuff or animating something
Consistency.
did you add the conda-forge channel to anaconda? try conda config --add channels conda-forge&amp;&amp; conda install tweepy
Its nothing fancy but if you like to see it can i move it to my public rep instead of my private.
If PyYAML was to be included in the stdlib, I would like to see a re-think of its API. For example, `safe_load` should be the default.
 pip -e /my/random/dev/location/obscured This will, as far as I can tell, allow you to edit the above python package and it'll automagically be tracked by pip. I'd assume pipenv is nothing but a wrapper. Maybe it'll package it if needed. Without -e, the pip package would be installed in the /site-packages/ directory.
The only thing more important than using PEP-8 is being consistent with your teams style guides.
If you can i would love to see it

Awesome thank you
Got [https://github.com/milin/giticket](https://github.com/milin/giticket) working few days back. Yay for no manual entry of jira tickets in commits!
Sometimes you need to submit a windows path to subprocess. 
Fixed. Thanks for bringing this up man, I appreciate that.
FYI this function works only in Python 3.3 and above. 
Thanks for your input! I really appreciate it. 1. Doh! Can't believe I didn't do snake\_case. 2. Ah ok, I have never really used Python 2 so I was unaware that was a reserved keyword. 3. That's cool about the pop() thing, I was afraid if I didn't assign it to a variable it would just output the contents to the console. 4. That's a much better way to layout the chained methods. I'm going to implement that if you don't mind. 5. I understand about the bare except statement. I couldn't really think of anything really useful to do with it in this case though. Again, thanks heaps for the feedback, I really appreciate it!
That's a good idea, I'm going to try implement that too! I was worried the code would be hard to follow, it is a bit of a mess...
It looks like a fantastic library that provides great functionality. But note that those classes are not thread-safe - you have to manually synchronize access to the methods of a shared cache in a multi-threaded environment. 
Strong types? Otherwise my unit tests need to check for types, and this is nonsense 
Or, df.head(5) to just output the top 5 records of your dataframe.
Wouldn't this be slower running a separate process instead of a thread? What are your thoughts on using coroutines instead of a thread?
Also, [functools.lru\_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) must be used as a decorator only. 
I've had a few people point this out and I totally should have used snake\_case. I blame writing most of the code late at night fueled by caffeine as to why I did that. I'll fix that up shortly.
Yeah, I dunno why I did camelCase. I do heaps of Java stuff for uni so I blame that mixed with being tired when I wrote the code. I'll be fixing that up shortly!
Also, check /r/learnpython
Dude this is great, i was trying to create something familiar, i was using twilio to send me a text but this is waaaay better. Thank you so much
I have a good job in IT these days, but coming from a agriculture university, I had to start at the bottom of the ladder. And work very hard to proof myself in order to advance in my career. A few years back I moved to London and tried to get a job here, and despite having a long and good cv, quite a few companies dismissed me based on a lack of a relevant degree. Btw I have found a awesome job and couldn’t be happier with it.. but it does make life harder without papers

In Australia nearly everyone pays using "paywave" or "paypass", NFC tech, whatever you want to call it. Hardly anyone uses cash or cheques anymore. When I went to the US in 2016 I was shocked to see hardly anywhere accepted it, and when I used my Credit Card to pay I had to sign for it every single time, even at places like 7 Eleven or McDonalds. It felt so weird. Americans have some of the best tech in the world, but in other ways they are so behind.
Thanks for that! I was a bit worried I was explaining a little bit too much.
No, you're not telling a story. It was great! 
My first goto in this situation is to just download a python compiler, make an exe, and then send that.

I'd like the sidebar to be really concrete and specific and brief - all three! :-) - about what Belongs in r/python. Right now, there's nothing there --- I personally wanted to know, but only saw a slice of what's _not_ wanted ... 
pyinstaller or the like is a well known option. There's also winpython [https://winpython.github.io/](https://winpython.github.io/)
Don't use floats for currency. 
What are your requirements? without those I cannot say. 
A lot of people don't think pathlib is "better" or "simpler." I certainly don't think it is. I think the existence of pathlib just makes paths in python more complex and harder to work with. There is a real tension between "batteries included" and "one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to things." The biggest irritation for me within the last few years is the inconsistency in how that tension has been resolved.
From what I've seen a portfolio with projects matters the most. Don't focus on certificates yet, what you need is knowledge and experience, the only way to get those is through practicing. A certificate and a degree in CS are completely different, a decent certificate will offer you a specialization whereas a degree in CS will offer you broad knowledge which is something that you need right now, since you have just started. You need to start small and grow bigger, it doesn't matter if the idea behind your script is not that exciting or useful. Start building your portfolio and read as much as you can, it's the best way in every aspect. I hope I helped, good luck with your search.
I just started today (again) with programming in Python, will probably start with a small notes application to learn the basics of Python. As a first step I'm making myself read the book "Programming Python" from Mark Lutz everyday for at least 30 min til an hour. 2019 goals are real this year 👌🏼
transaction_fee = 0.015 gbps = sorted([350, 750, 1000, 2000]) fees = sorted([0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 3.5]) assert len(gbps) === len(fees) while gbps and gbps[-1] &gt; gbp: transaction_fee = gbps.pop() and fees.pop()
tldr; My take on the benefits of stretching your coding to learn the functional style: * Easier to read, understand, and maintain * More reliable (fewer opportunities for bugs) * Less code required
You want to distribute wheel files and use pip to install them; so package your code with `python setup.py bdist_wheel`. For third party modules; see the link below. https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
Oh I totally agree, and I would want ruamel version personally, not PyYAML
Both! I got two undergrads in mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering, all the while pursuing comp sci in my "off time". I took the opportunity to jump ship into the software developer field but yes, mat sci was part of my formal training.
Sudoku is an excellent exercise to solve using a completely different approach, if you are learning or want to try something "unusual": [Logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) (using the Prolog programming language, for example, using [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/)). In logic programming, you "teach" the computer the problem's rules and constraints, instead of implementing how to solve it. After trying it, you could feel Python is no longer the *best* tool for this particular problem (and that's OK!).

At ''' lat, lon = (price_and_loc[2][54:-9] .split(',') ) ''' Why select at 54 and go back 9, instead of selecting from 45 to 54?
I love list comprehensions and I’ve been using them more recently, but this video has totally changed how I viewed them. Great to think of them as a list your building with the instructions inside! Thanks! Generator expressions next? 
I definitely don't have this problem myself, so something is fishy. Small requests like that would take 50ms at most unless the response body is huge.

A junior dev would get paid more for a single hour of work. Sorry, but you'll learn a lot if you try to learn how to do this yourself 
Thanks for the feedback, appreciated! Yep, I thought it'd be useful to see how a senior dev (me) thinks about these things. Generator expressions, yep, are probably my next video because they make it easy to get some pretty radical speed gains and memory use reductions ... all while using this nice syntax.
Well the first thing that comes to my mind is: what is his job? Can he code something that can help him or make his job easier/more fun? How about drawing with turtule? I surely didnt get to love python by plotting using pandas, tk and what not. Maybe tell him to try pygame? Or he can create a favorite games launcher script. Nothing too fancy, double click to run the script and then pressing 1, 2 or 3 for the desired game. Hope this gives some ideas :)
creating a batch that downloads python would in most cases be too much for the users to do instead of just running an executeable.
which one ?
See that's the thing, he hasn't really done much with his life - smart guy - took a bunch of AP classes and did well on them in high school, but just hasn't applied himself as an adult. He works at a gas station. Don't think there's anything that he could automate in his work that isn't automated already (I think?)
argh sorry i posted in the wrong sub ? :(

I recently got into learning haskell, and I enjoyed it a lot! got the idea of currying and function composition stuck in my head, and I wanted python to do the same in a more readable way. So, I made a really really small module, for composing and currying functions but in an exotic way (using overloaded operators). Here is what I ended up with: [exotic functions](https://github.com/aymanizz/exotic-functions). Its where the exotic functions live now :). here is a small example exotic % print @ str.join * ' ' * ['hello', 'world'] | apply there are more stuff that can be done, but this is a small sample. ignoring the `exotic %` part (used to construct an instance of the ExoticFunction class, in an exotic way!), `@` is used for composition, `*` is for partial application, and the last part `| apply` applies the function. I am also open for more exotic ideas!
You can get away with using `Decimal`.
Hmm.. is there an gas station api? Maybe he can scrape the website and look for info? Do they have deals and discounts? Maybe take customers email and/or phones and write a script that will send them these info when they happen? How about calculating average gas refil based on 7 days of his work or more? Any hobbies? Does he like to tinker? Maybe just... i dont know. Project euler is good if he wanna solve problems. 
Please don't post tutorials for beginners
The reason is because I am unsure if Google always uses the same precision for GPS coordinates. By just going back 9 I can get rid of the "Details:" part at the end of the string and know I have just the GPS coordinates, no matter how many decimal places they have. That being said, I have realized I made a mistake and I should only going back 8 places instead of 9!
I'll talk to him about and see if there's anything he'd like to do. He's interested in "cooler" stuff, like the idea of machine learning and stuff like that. His math is probably good but not great though.
As far as I remember from Windows: You simply need to install the standalone Microsoft Build Tools then run `bdist_wheel` using 64 bit and 32 bit version of the python versions you want to support. This will generate the following wheels for python 7. ``` mypackage-&lt;version&gt;-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl mypackage-&lt;version&gt;-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl ``` You can probably take a look at setup.py in https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL as this project builds for Windows, Linux and OS X. Also check out the wheels generated from latest release https://pypi.org/project/moderngl/5.4.2/#files You also always want to build an sdist in case your wheels do not support a specific platform so people can compile it on their own. 
Thanks - I looked to the sidebar, but couldn't find info on what is appropriate. (Only that beginner _questions_ should not be posted.) And I looked at r/learnpython, but it seemed to be only for questions.

You can definitely use travis-ci and appveyor to simplify these steps. Might make more sense for a projects involving multiple people with a more frequent release schedule. I personally prefer just doing build + publish manually for now. I guess it's just a time vs reward thing.
Maybe edit the question because this changes the scope dramatically :)
Indeed!
Did you ever find out why you had a charge in Indonesian Rupees? Could that be a test charge to see if your account is valid? Possibly the smallest charge possible?
It looks for a value for args named `:foo` in parameters["foo"]: rows = cursor.execute(query, {sTable:"TABLE_NAME"})
Why don't you test it?
Python already is a strongly-typed language. Python isn't a *statically*-typed language, which is what you appear to be asking for, but you can annotate functions/methods (since 3.0) and variables (since 3.6), and there are tools like mypy which can run static analysis based on those annotations, as well as a standard-library module (since 3.5) providing useful code to support this. But Python will never become a language with mandatory static typing. If you want that, there are plenty of them available.
efmccurdy - THANK YOU!!!!
Of course, the opposite position -- never add anything new, because then there'd be two ways do to a thing! -- is not particularly great. Which is why the Zen of Python is a set of guidelines, rather than a set of iron-bound absolute unbreakable laws, and why you'll find "practicality beats purity" in there.
Where is that
What people find exciting is very subjective. I would probably try to narrow it down. Some prefer visual things over an invisible system. Does it have to be something useful at all or just plain fun? It's really a very open ended question. Get his help to narrow it down.
Start small and work your way up. If you get overwhelmed you'll likely give up. We've all written "Hello World!"
No no, I'm trying to ignite his passion. I've gotten him to do "Hello World!" tutorials before. Maybe I'll just come up with a structured newbie project for him that is related to his interests.
I did not. The same thought crossed my mind too. However, that was the only purchase made at the casino and I know I paid for dinner their too. My thought is maybe they somehow charged me in Indonesian Rupees instead of AUD. It's only been the one charge and I don't go to the casino that often so I'm not too worried, but I'll definitely keep an eye out for it from now on.
Where is the stripper club at?
&gt; That's cool about the pop() thing, I was afraid if I didn't assign it to a variable it would just output the contents to the console. The automatic repr()-and-print() only happens for expressions typed/piped into the interactive REPL. &gt; I understand about the bare except statement. I couldn't really think of anything really useful to do with it in this case though. The `pass` here is fine; if the correct thing to do is skip the element, this is the way to do it. Bare except refers to `except:` as opposed to `except Exception:` or a more specific exception type. As an example of how this can bite you, interrupting the program Ctrl-C raises a `KeyboardInterrupt`, but an `except` suite without a specific type it catches would catch that interrupt, skip the current element, and keep going instead of terminating. If you typo an attribute name (`AttributeError`), pass a value of the wrong type to a function (`TypeError`), or have any other code error, those will also be eaten and silenced the same way. If you remove the try/except/pass and run it, the console output will show the fully qualified name of the exception class. You can then catch those exceptions specifically (`try:`/`except bs4.errors.SomeErrorType` for example) while letting other exceptions go uncaught and get handled as they would normally. If it's an `AttributeError` having to do with `None`/`NoneType` or an `IndexError` or something else with a single easy-to-check cause, I personally prefer to sprinkle in `if x is None:`/`if len(x) &gt;= expected_len:` checks and return early, but this is somewhat against Pythonic ideology (prefer "try it and see if it fails" over "check whether it will work before trying", or in other words "better to ask forgiveness than permission").

What's your stack?
I've been working on a [script](https://github.com/Eshkation/SpotifyDownloader/) to download spotify albums and playlists using youtube, having so much fun playing with things as this is my first github project
I saw there was once a script (maybe written in Python?) that would call up the API for a pizza chain and place an order for a pizza. The idea was that you could hook it up via alias to some default values or call it via Cron and automate the pizza ordering process. I thought it was really neat at the time, but it seems to have disappeared. I saw a recent post here about somebody who wrote a script to send a (random?) image to a family member. The OP didn't do it, but it could have easily been set up with Cron to give the family member a regular feed of images over time. Another idea is to write a bot for Slack, Reddit, or some other such platform to respond to simple commands with information or something silly. Anything you can do that promotes a sense of autonomous action on the part of a script should produce a disproportionate sense of "Wow". Cron scripts and Web-hooks are two great ways of making that happen.

Hrm, a bot might be a good idea. I don't think he really uses reddit, but he does use Facebook, so maybe a Facebook bot
Requests was actually considered for adding to the standard library, but their decided you keep it separate so is could be updated more frequently. 
Does he like sports? Make a sports score web scraper! Or any type of scraper for that matter.
Psutils exists on Linux. Pathlin or pathlib2 for python 2.7 work fine.
Meanwhile in the city of Townsville... Great work, man! Forget the haters. If you're just doing a personal project, use whatever case you want. PEP-8 even says that you can stray as long you're consistent with yourself.
Yeah, a scraper isn't a bad idea!
Do you know a little bit of HTML and CSS? Python eel is an awesome module that lets you generate HTML/CSS GUI's just like electron for javascript, but lighter and simpler. [https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)
Pygame would probably be the easiest way to create what you're thinking about. As far as how to detect walls, you'll probably figure out that part along the way when you're designing your "car" object and determining how it figures out its location and what's around it. When you create the objects like walls and the car, you can use pygame.Rects as collision boxes, and check for collisions with methods like pygame.Rect.colliderect to see if two Rects have collided.
What is lambda?
Sounds like he is still in school waiting for the next assignment. You gotta set your own assignments in life, right? That's what makes it hard. My interest in learning python was from necessity to automate things at work. Now that that is over I've lost interest, kind of like your mate. You could give him the most interesting project ever and it probably won't help... perhaps try get him an interesting job instead that will eventually necessitate leaning coding? 
I would recommend showing him web scraping for data that may help him with a hobby or interest. Requests is good for a lot of simple sites, but showing him selenium with a chrome extension is cool because you can program it then watch it perform actions in your browser before your eyes. Could be something as simple as logging into Twitter and downloading tweets. From some of the other comments, sounds like he doesn't have a lot of things going well career wise. If he likes the web scraping, maybe go over some simple ETL projects like pulling a csv from an SFTP site and loading it to a database. Pretty simple, but it can be a very valuable skill to a potential employer. 
thanks a lot !! I'll surely look at it.
Thanks. I'll probably try few to explore a bit. Did you use it for web as well?
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is the easier way to manage packages and virtual environments in my opinion.
Holy shit, there's a lot going on there. Wah. 
What basic stuff do you feel you overlooked that you wish to learn? 
Learned what classes are today thanks to the Python discord. Wrapping up my shortcut manager program, which is a script that stays open on my computer at all times, and launches different programs or functions based off of words I put in to it. Right now, it's capable of launching most programs I use on my computer, sleeping the computer, opening a browser tab to a specific URL, closing itself, listing its own commands, and I intend to build modes into it that will do a bunch of things at once. For example, gaming mode, triggered maybe with the keyword game, would close all programs, then launch steam or overwatch. Keyword program would open 3 chrome tabs including my schedule page, a Google search page, and a stackoverflow.com tab, as well as opening a command line and sublime text 3. I'd like to build in a way to also launch Spotify and start playing music but I think I'll need to import a lib to do that, and I need to figure out how that works. I'm sure there's a way to control Spotify media out there though. Tomorrow is also ideas day. I need to come up with some new project ideas seeing as how I'm almost done with my shortcuts manager. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
trying to make my keylogger work behind a "reverse shell" &amp;#x200B;
That's a REALLY good idea!! 
Nobody (as far as I've seen) has explained the real reason you're not supposed to do it that way. Not being "Pythonic" is only secondary. The main reason is that when you iterate through a list based on its size, you can't change the size of the list by deleting or adding items inside the for loop or you could end up with index errors. For example if you try and delete an item from the list while iterating through it based on the length, you'll change the length and end up with an index out of bounds error, like: nums = [1,2,3,4] for i in range(len(nums)): if nums[i] == 2: del nums[i] The list starts out as size 4, but the size is reduced during the for loop, so by the time it gets to the end and is looking at index 3... it no longer exists. However, using enumerate, you can alter the length of the list as you iterate over it, like: for i, num in enumerate(nums): if num == 2: del nums[i]
That looks really nice! I package my software into exe's for win10 with pyinstaller --onefile, would this be compatible with that do you think?

It looks like it's a span that's being placed there dynamically. It has no id, and its classes are random looking strings. They intentionally do that to try to prevent what you're trying to do, I'd wager.

You should go to r/learnpython
You should include increasing the bet after a win as well. A game like roulette is basically buying variance at the cost of expected value. Strategies like yours run counter to this, but usually allow you to play longer at the casino. So you are cutting down your variance, but risking a big loss. You are betting 1024 to win 1 with high probability. The casino will take this bet all day.

That's a really good idea actually - so it could increase its bet after a win by a random amount between 0 and 100, and should it win, decrease the bet back to 0. Interesting. I will include that and see how it performs.
Started a company 5 years ago and there were still some packages we were using that hadn't upgraded. Now our codebase is big and a pain to convert, though I am trying to do it incrementally.
There are a couple of games out there that he could play. Look at some of the games by [Zachtronics](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/zachtronics), That will introduce him to a very simplified assembly framework or algorithmic problem solving. Your best bet would be the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft which uses lua to program computers and turtles (robots). I got it though the Technic mod packs. I used computer craft to make a massive automated wheat farm to convert wheat into materials using equivalent exchange.

Not Python related at all. But why? Why not just use the official GMail API?
The ability from the `platform` package to fetch information about the CPU. I.e. the available SIMD flags, the number of virtual and physical cores, the clock frequency, etc. 
Depending on what you mean by "input" (stdin? Files? Sockets? Something else?), it's already there.
If you're willing to have a ~100 MB installer, you can bundle an entire Python environment. I wrote a guide: http://www.entropyreduction.al/python/distutils/2017/09/21/bundle-python-app-w-inno-setup.html 
This is generally called 'dithering', if you are trying to make a 2D image from a bunch of random-access points. Dithering is normally binary but it can be done in greyscale (or false color) as need be. My typical approach would be to define some 2D array that provides a bounding box for all your points. Then you need to define a point-spread function (e.g. some 2D gaussian distribution) for each of your points and add one PSF for each point in your coordinate set. 
A more modern way to handle it is to use the suppress context manager from contextlib https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress
Ohhh.... that is really cool! I've never even seen that before. Thanks heaps for that!
For those learning C++, it would be more accurate to say that `using namespace x;` aliases all entries of that namespace as if they existed in the current scope :P Also `using some_namespace::something;` aliases specifically the entry `some_namespace::something` to the current scope, rather than everything in a given namespace. It's fine to do this in some cases, ex, you need to use 20/21 different things from a namespace in a given scope, but the problem is if you put it at the file level (not some namespace in a file, but the file itself), it polutes the global scope.

I see. I found pathlib great to work with, though admittedly there was a period while I had to switch my thinking over. Also, pre-3.6, shutil didn't work with Path objects and I got into a habit of always converting to strings which is a hard to break habit.
Like said before, a scraper which push the data into a timeseries database. Like gasoline or diesel prices. To compare the prices between the gas station in the near - or in the whole city, country. Plus point: some work on statistics. 
&gt; Nor does the `id()` function return an address (except by accident). The `id()` function is documented as returning an *abstract ID number*, and in fact Jython and IronPython uses sequential numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... as IDs. Correction, it is documented as &gt; an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value. And furthermore the fact that it is the address is not an accident. If sometines it was the address and other times some calculated value, it would be an accident. But it's actually a conscious implementation detail: &gt; CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory. So if you strictly will rely on some version of CPython and not just any flavor/version combo of Python, it is safe to say it is, and safe to treat it as, the memory address of the underlining PyObject.
Currently learning Python OOP :) 
I'd suggest to make a project with your friend, so he can learn and have fun with a mate at the same time. I tried too to help a friend learn coding by writing in Python a Telegram Bot with him that we added to one of our chats, this bot was half silly half useful with features like: \- random insult to someone in the chat \- post random memes when someone types a particular keyword i.e: if I typed "I had too many beers" the Bot posted a meme on beers \- suggestion on pubs to go out when someone typed "where tonight?" &amp;#x200B; I think a telegram bot is a good easy starting point to text analysis / NLA / machine learning 
Seconded, frequency domain analysis is the way to go here.
If you are into discord servers, a bot is a fantastic place to start. ( use the " discord.py rewrite" version). You can setup a server for free, create bot for free and setup tons of funny retarded and useful commands. You can build your bot in multiple ways, from the very simple if loop checking the content of a message or the name of the sender to something more complex including modules, classes, args, decorators, async. -I once made a decimation command to snap half of the member of the server away from it during the release of avengers. -a command that rename them with retarded names. -actually useful commands like a dice command for D&amp;D that supports the dice size and format of your choice One of my discord buddy made a slot machine game with items you can cast to rig the game or steal other player items and cash and with a leveling system. Its truly an amazing playground 
Agree. A Flask api is also a great choice. If he is into twitch streamers and YouTube, twitter etc he could try to Replicate IFTTT and sends himself messages or notifications when a new video from his sub feed goes online etc. 
Zachtronics games are fucking awesome. But TAS and ShenzhenI/O are probably too hardcore for an absolute beginner especially if he isn't already used to read documentation . If he really wanna play Zach games he should get OpusMagnum first to train his logic a bit and then move to Shenzhen I think.

Awesome! I’ll check it out. I haven’t touched Python in a little while, cause I’ve been focusing on Java and Android Studio, but I’m getting a little burnt on it.
If you care to read my other answers on this thread I also made a point to mess around with discord bots. You really can do amazing things with them. Even really complicated stuff. Like sending a command in the chat to toggle on your alexa so she reads the chat or that kind of things. 
If you do more Python you will notice how irritating are packages with camelCase when all libs and your code is underscore_case. Bummer is that lots of C libs ports/bindings are in camelCase to keep names from original. It is good to get rid of bad habits as soon as possible. You will thank yourself later.
Bots are interesting. I’m on Twitch a lot too, and have wanted to mess around with making some bots on there. My problem is that I try to focus on too many projects at the same time, as I don’t have a lot of spare time to put towards learning this stuff. I managed to get a decent basic understanding of Python, at least. Much easier to grasp than Java
My fellow Python dev once said that in his company any Python function with more than 8 lines would not pass code review. It is a bit exaggerated but still true.

It looks promising... but I can't figure out the graph labels. e.g. https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples/regexp_ungrouped.html I would expect the labels to show the names of the functions? Instead it says "sre_compile._compile"?
Nice idea!!
Tell him to start with html ans css, then if he likes it hé can continue with php, js, ans then look for lower level languages 
Why not a contrib package for python? Apart from the stdlib, a collection of packages with option to update from pip. It would be great to have a recommended packages collection that can be installed directly from python org or Linux repos. Problem is if the os is dependant on pyyaml and if we put pyyaml in contrib and if somebody wants to upgrade it via pip (because we want to allow fast development) it'll cause a conflict for the os.
I think My heat map would be centered around Otto's..
First and foremost, BIG thanks for taking interest in this! I hope you liked the idea :). Although the idea is really simple, I admit the code might not be easy to read. I'll try to explain it as much as possible. The whole thing relies on operator overloading and operators precedence. To start lets parse the expression above step by step: ```python (((exotic % print) @ str.join) * ' ' * ['hello', 'world']) | (apply) ``` given that and the module `exotic.py` we can easily see what's going to happen: first `exotic.__mod__(print)` is called, then the method `__matmul__` of the result, which is an ExoticFunction instance that we will call `ef1` (see note below), is called: ```python exotic.__mod__(print).__matmul__(str.join) ``` this call also results in an exotic function instance too (lets call it `ef2`), there is a key thing to know here, which is the new instance (`ef2`) have `str.join` as the underlying function and not `print`, but it also has the instance of ExoticFunction from `print`. if you look at the code of `__matmul__` you wil see something equivelant to this happens: ```python ef2 = ExoticFunction(str.join, ef1) ``` the second argument is telling the new instance (`ef2`), "hey! After you apply yourself, I want you to call `self` (`ef1`) and pass the result to it." last thing, the `__mul__` method is called, this does nothing but partially applies the instance to the argument, it uses `functools.partial` to do it: ```python exotic.__mod__(print).__matmul__(str.join).__mul__(' ').__mul__(['hello', 'world']) ``` finally this whole mess is applied using `| apply`. Its really just a mess of partially applied functions passed arround. in Haskell the equivalent is something like this: ```haskell main = do putStrLn $ unwords ["hello", "world"] -- or using python functions print $ join ' ' ["hello", "world"] ``` notes: - the `exotic.__mod__` method merely takes a function as an argument and returns an instance of `ExoticFunction` with that function. - I would rather not explain what `| apply` is doing, but let you read the code. For an example, `ef1 | apply &lt;&lt; 'hello world'` is equivelant to `ef1("hello world")`. Well, I guess its not really a good explanation, but at least I hope it will help you get a better idea of what is going on. Also, I realized `@` is not really composing functions (like haskell's `.` operator) but rather applying the output of one to the other, more like haskell's `$` operator. But it can also be thought of as the composition operator. Hmm, maybe I, myself, don't understand this whole mess really well LOL.
Ah! A fellow Townsvillian I see! I must admit, there is a bit of "heat" at Otto's on my map! 
What a fun project. Well done.

Thanks for the feedback. For the input data, I have used content editable html. You can just press enter and a new line will appear. Similarly for the regex, if you want to make it multiline, choose the verbose flag.
Just some tips to improve: &amp;#x200B; \- add a README to your git repo and move your description there \- move all of your import statements to the top of the python file \- I haven't really seen global variables used the way you use them (or actually used at all for that matter). \- Try to avoid defining functions within functions unless you have a very good reason for it. It makes the code a lot less readable. \- It seems that your project could (and should) be refactored (this just means reorganised) into a Class. Then your global variables can become class/object variables, and all your methods can be inside it. &amp;#x200B; But I think you've made a great start, keep it up!
I use [this](https://regexr.com/) to test my regex. It has two nice features: multiline input field and regex reference page on the side. I think that you should consider adding them.
Why do you need Pandas for a simple CSV? 
Maybe `pip3 install rasa`?
I have seen regexr site before. It is for Javascript and PCRE, not for Python. For multiple lines, just press enter in the data field (after entering something).
folium rocks 
No, I mean making input field bigger.
Really cool project :) I\`m using [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/), it has Python flavor and quick reference plus regex explanation pane.
The input field can be as as big as you want - I have kept a limit of 500 characters. Just hit enter for additional lines or copy-paste text.
Second this. It also has a convenient code generator for the regex tested there, to save some time, and the UI coloring effects and guide in the right makes the work with RE really simple and productive.

Wow, didn't see it there... Small regerx reference would be nice though.
Wow, didn't see it there... Small regerx reference would be nice though.
Show him regular expressions, that'd be fun. All jokes aside, web scraping would be a cool example.
Sure it has more bells and whistles - looks like it has been around for a while. Didn't see the flags for Python though.

OP is probably coming from another programming language, so I think they are fine for now. I took a look at a code from when I started learning python, and it looke horrendously like C. Nowadays I can see how much progress I've made after I learned what "pythonic" means and after I learned how to properly use the python \*for\* and OOP.

Could you monkey patch the py 3 dictionary like this (needs a few adaptations for python 3), a bit involved but might just be what you need. Also I don't know from a performance perspective.

Thought I'd see this link - IMO OP has just rephrased part of Norvig's essay.
To expand on u/ChargedSquid This is an ideal project for Python and would be a good learning project. You should take a copy of the CSV and a few files to test on. Do not run the code on the full folder without testing. Bad things can happen. 
Alpha move, go in there and say "I prefer to do the coding interview in R and I'll explain to you why R is better than Python."
thanks a lot to provide these useful information.
Yes, Dash is not for just gathering a few visualizations and making dashboard. It developed to make web application on plotly base. I used dash for web application and still using it with my colleagues for KPI analysis purpose in my company. In your case, you can try it with AWS or GCP + Dash. As I remember, most cheap instance is free.
Indeed. I saw there was a heatmap with time option as well. I wanna have a look into that!

No, but a search for "composition over inheritance" should give you all you need. The basic idea is to make your class structures as simple as possible. So you want a `Sink` on your `Bathroom`. Instead of inheriting from `SinkMixin` or `Kitchen` or whatever, just pass a sink instance to your bathroom or add it like `br.sink = Sink()`. Obviously a stupid example but that's the best I've got this early in the morning.

Great post, have a look at pdbpp which I found nicer than ipdb, mainly for the sticky mode :)
Simple, yet useful. Thanks!
Thank you very much. Cant wait to read through it 
r/learnpython. Read the sidebar before posting man. Google's tutorials for tensorflow are pretty good if I remember correctly.
My favorite pdb/ipdb feature is conditional breakpoints. From the pdb prompt you can do something like this: b path/to/file.py, x == 5 This will only break at that line if and when x is 5. Also a lot of people don’t know this
Oh good, python regexes never work how I expect them. Hopefully this will fix my expectations. Already downloaded, printed and clipped.
Some other cool debugging tips: Conditional breakpoints: At the pdb/ipdb prompt type `b path/to/script.py, x==5` This will only break there if and when it reaches that line and x is 5. Jupyter debugger: Notebooks come with ipdb built in. If you experience an exception you can just execute `debug` or `%debug` to get a post mortem debugger. Run Call: You can start a debugger session directly from a function call. ipdb.runcall(your_function, arg1, arg2, kw1=val1)
Sorry, thanks for your comment though 
Selenium supports python very well, most people in powershell or other sub reddit locations arn't familiar with it. I though that the ID may be changing so thank you for this I really appreciate it. I'll brain storm from here. I mostly need this to work in powershell so I'm all over the place. Thanks again for helping me and taking the time to look into it.
First of all, use Python 3 instead of Python 2. And it's no surprise it asks you for root permission; you're trying to modify files that are "not yours". `Is it safe?`, yes, it is.
I need the gui interface of it; from what I have seen the gui api is more for sending the smtp message, I just need the browser window to open up with google authentication.
Thanks :) It helps if you like the topic and have loads of free time from being on a sabbatical To help you stick with it, break it down into few chunks to read everyday. There are 50 pages, so something like 1 page a day or 1 chapter a day will establish a routine and you'll get a basic idea in 3-4 weeks. Best of luck!!
Just wanna build some package that needs virtualenv, REALLY not into a whole python upgrade, specially because as you say, not "mine". 
Thanks, please do leave your feedback :)
It’s not that I overlooked all basic syntax when it comes to Python. I think where my issue lies is I “hit the ground running” persay, when I should’ve adopted a “crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run” mentality. What I’m focusing on this week is Regex and Classes. Making a few programs a day and watching different ways these can implemented. Regex is very weird to me, but seems really fun. 
Regexes do come with plenty of warts. They are like a mini programming language, with variables, functions, conditionals, repetition, etc. And like programming languages, syntax and features vary from tool to tool. One suggestion would be to use VERBOSE mode to add comments. Maintain notes (say as markdown file with syntax highlighting) for common examples and use it as your reference tailored for the language and your own preferences. There are also online visual aid like https://regex101.com/ and https://www.debuggex.com/ which could help you in debugging
Weirdly enough finding the line where the error is is enough for me to debug. For the most part u can work backwards from there to find a fix. Although u need to understand where data is flowing in your program and how it’s behaving, but arguably that’s the better way to debug because it keeps u consistently wondering about the state of your program.

The python in Library is macOS's default python. I would advise to never mess with it in any way. If you use Homebrew (it's a great tool on macOS), I advise you install python with it. It'll give you a pip with that. Make sure your /usr/local/bin precedes /Library in your PATH, and you should be good to go.
You're not updating all of Python, just pip. I said "not yours", because of how file permissions work. Of course those files are yours \^\^ 
Thanks! I will :)
No no, regexes themselves are no mystery to me. It's the python implementation that confuses me frequently. I've never been able to get the options to work how I expect.
Pudb is the first thing I install in every Dev venv
&gt; The fact that I'm talking about refactoring implies that I've been writing my code the other way - importing everything in each individual module, and separating everything. if a module uses a,b,c you should import a, b and c. if it imports d and d is not used you are doing it wrong. &gt; I know the rules, I follow them. The only time I ever use 'star' import is when importing QT libraries in Maya projects, and only because I have to make my code easily switchable between PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide, PySide2. import as. &gt; It is sometimes a good idea to question the rules. And there's an old saying "rules are there to be broken". _some_ rules are there to be _adapted_, not broken. Some rules are there because it's a really good idea. If you break them, you better have a damn good reason. This is one rule that is not a good idea to break, for your and others' sanity. &gt; Namely I'm talking about Maya plugins, and a few TDs projects' from large and respectable studios. I tell you a secret. Large and respectable studios have still crappy code and crappy coders. &gt; And they use this kind of importing quite often. because they are wrong, or they don't care, or they are 2 days from the deadline, or they gave the project to the intern who does not know python or they outsourced it to india to three guys who work 14 hours a day to deliver unmaintainable code because that's how they keep customers coming back. &gt; This is what made me question it. I wonder why that is. There must be a reason other than "they just don't know that they are doing it wrong". Or maybe it is the only reason. the reason is that they are doing it wrong. It's a bad idea. Period. Like it's a bad idea to have globals or use gotos. When those things were deemed bad ideas, the argument was the same: the code looks bad, and back then, there were still people arguing that there was nothing wrong with globals and gotos, We've used them for years. &gt; And again - I was partially looking at this measure of making my code harder to read on purpose as part of it's obfuscation. You are doing wrong even more now. &gt; To make it harder for anyone who'd try to crack licensing system to understand which module is used where. You don't write your own licensing system. You buy it. End of story. &gt; I never said it's hard coded. These paths are generated based on user's environment: OS, Host software version, config parameters, and other variables. I decided that generating them once on project import excellent. so now you have IO as a side effect of importing a module. which means that the first time your IO gets stuck for whatever reason importing the module will take forever and make it harder to test because all your code relies on global information rather than passed, local information. You don't trigger side effects on import. &gt; is better than creating a functino that would generate it each time it's called. It would require IO and processing on each call. Granted it's not much, but still. 99% it's not a problem 1% if it bothers you you can make a closure and memoize it. &gt; it's not for customers. It's for developer sanity, self documentation, and proper coding practices. &gt; &gt; Or maybe insanity of other people trying to reverse your code? :D So you write bad code so that nobody can reverse engineer it. Got it. Good luck 
That's the spirit! Also your name makes me think of an enders game character so well done for that as well!
&gt; The python in Library is macOS's default python. I would advise to never mess with it in any way. Exactly what I was thinking here, since vanilla upgrades were flat out denied. &gt; Make sure your /usr/local/bin precedes /Library in your PATH, and you should be good to go Close to what I want to, I believe the safest way to build my thing is to create some VM that comes with python and do it, using Vagrant or something like it. Any tip for a non dev to spin this off quickly? 
Thanks a bunch! Will try reading it over the weekend :)
oh ok, the `regex` module is closer to PCRE if that helps.. it has two versions, default version 0 is compatible with Python re module and changing it to version 1 would give you many more goodies
There is a position in between the two, and it would have been the one I would encourage: Accept pathlib, but only on the condition that path objects inherit from the string class. This would mean that certain valid "paths" per the POSIX standard could not be accessed by pathlib because they wouldn't be encodeable as strings but merely as bytes. BUT my feeling is that little is lost by not being able to access such paths with pathlib. It is very rare that one actually wants a path with these characters in them, so pathlibs inability to manipulate them would clearly signal that something has gone wrong.
Sorry, I was using the word _process_ in a different context, I didn't mean a process in the computing sense. You could prune expired keys every time `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` and friends are called. By doing the work 'just in time', you could do without threads entirely. Threads will actually be an overhead here, since you aren't benefiting from concurrency. Coroutines are pretty much in the same boat.
Many thanks. I didnt include a loop.

I know a company that can provide you with this data. The problem is that you dataset is way to small. What you are trying to is quite hard, mostly because search engines dont like bots or scripts that abuse their engine. What you could try is to use a proxy (like storm proxy) and use that to hide that you are a bot. Even then it can be difficult to use google/bing/duckduckgo
I'm definitely going to be using the conditional debugging, thanks for this!
I really like the -i flag when running python from the command line like this: python -i error.py If error.py terminates, either due to an error or just because the script is finished, you can still use all global variables and see what's wrong with them. 
That would be overkill in my opinion. Are you familiar with using a Terminal?
Yum yum yummy regie rexies in my tummy yum
rsync?
Linux only, isn't it? I unfortunately have to use both Windows and Linux.
Totally. But safe. &gt; Are you familiar with using a Terminal? Not scared by it, not a pro for sure. From where I see, you want me to install python 3 for my user on mac, leaving the osx version (/Library) alone, is that so? How?

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a side project that I've been working on while doing an internship. It's an all-in-one dev environment packaged as a Docker container that works for almost all usage scenarios in doing data science, machine learning or deep learning development. Here's what the workflow looks like now starting from a "blank" workstation or instance: 1. Install drivers/CUDA/Docker with script (using another side project... haha) `curl` [`https://getcuda.ml/ubuntu.sh`](https://getcuda.ml/ubuntu.sh) `| sudo bash` (yes `curl | sudo bash` is bad but it's really thrilling) 2. `docker pull nvaitc/ai-lab:latest` 3. `nvidia-docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /home/USER:/home/jovyan nvaitc/ai-lab` With those three steps, a fully-configured Jupyter Notebook/Lab pops up and becomes fully available for use with frameworks including TensorFlow/PyTorch/MXNet/RAPIDS etc. Of course, you can use it interactively without Jupyter and also launch it from within JupyterHub. This makes it really easy to just get started in a new environment anywhere (with an Internet connection) I'm just sharing this because it has been super useful to me and some members of my team so I'm trying to package this nicely and share it with others! I'm also soliciting feedback and comments so do let me know what you think about this! GitHub: [https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab](https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab) Instructions (feedback welcome): [https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
rsync has Windows builds and there are third-party GUIs available for it.
You lost me at third-party GUI. That defeats the purpose of simplicity and is the reason for creating a one-script-does-all.
Said third party GUIs can come with rsync bundled if you want to. They're also way, way faster than what you're doing.
Definitely not faster, switch out SHA512 with MD5 and it's a pissing contest between the two. The differences in speed is marginal at best.
I think that the trace back is enough for me for my code, but I’ve had to debug others’ code a couple times. Next time I have to do that, I think I’ll probably try to learn a real debugger.
Gave it a quick glance, glad you got something that works for you and nice entry Python project! &amp;#x200B; Code suggestions: * Don't have try-except blocks without an exception type [https://codecalamity.com/exception-exception-read-all-about-it/#the-basic-try-except-block](https://codecalamity.com/exception-exception-read-all-about-it/#the-basic-try-except-block) * Would be must more readable using string format instead of + for all the strings (and better practice) * Even though it's small, would be nice to have it as 2 or 3 files (library, cli, gui) so user's could just grab / use exactly what they need. 
Thanks for the suggestions, I'll look into making those changes!
Yeah I'm not sure what the stance is on other search engines, but you will need to jump through a lot of hoops to get this to work on Google as they can be pretty quick on IP banning multiple searches from suspected bots. I'm unsure about Bing or DuckDuckGo though, I imagine your best bet might actually be a legal one, and you might want to check some ToS before jumping into this.
For learning Python, I generally recommend coupling [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) (LPTHW), where you'll learn the syntax, with something more practical like [A Practical Introduction to Python 3](https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/). Real Python's Practical Introduction to Python 3 takes on a project-based, learning by doing approach, while LPTHW is all about repetition so that you learn the syntax quickly. Try alternating the chapters.
Is the leanpub link dead for anyone else?
Maybe like this? text = '''&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; //&lt;!\[CDATA\[createCaptcha('9573');//\\\]\\\]&gt; &lt;/script&gt;''' print(''.join(\[s for s in text if s.isdigit()\]))
Just use rsync
There are few examples including Notepad: [https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto/tree/master/examples) &amp;#x200B; What is the exact code you're trying? And which traceback? pywinauto has higher learning curve, but more powerful for text properties access.
 Maybe like this? `text = '''&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; //&lt;![CDATA[createCaptcha('9573');//\]\]&gt; &lt;/script&gt;'''` `print(''.join([s for s in text if s.isdigit()]))`
sounds like a plan! =\]
What do you need a GUI for, you just need to call rsync with a few parameters on the commandline. You can let your python script do that. If you need to take a look into pyside2 and make a GUI for your tool in python.
Ok, so your python tool is faster than rsync .... oookay. quick get him a coat.
could you check again, it is loading slowly but it does open after a while
Wow! This is very helpful! Thank you! I’m based out of Atlanta, Georgia. 
Congratulations on the book and thank you for sharing
Yeah, I've definitely tried to convince him to get another job before. He ostensibly says he wants to (and I earnestly believe on some level he does), but never does. He's my oldest friend (I've known the guy since I was 12), and I think he'd be great at development just from the other parts of his personality
Good life advice in general, imo... break goals into manageable subtasks!
Copy operations is largely dependent on read/write speeds alone, software differences are negligible. Your post belongs on /r/iamverysmart. 
In simple cases yes this can be a faster method of debugging, sure. But in scenarios where bugs aren't so simple or apparent it can be extremely valuable to be able to inspect the state of the context when an exception is thrown or bug occurs.
Lol, I'll spare him from that pain for now. I'm learning some Computational Linguistics (arguably crazier than regex) for a project I want to create and I've actually showed him a bit of that. He thought it was cool and terrifying
This is the first time I've seen someone say regex was "magical." 
I'd like to see the numbers. 
It is a very grey area, but you can use selenium to mimick a browser doing the searches. Otherwise, legally, you won't get results that are as good as those from a regular web search.
&gt;available Did you misread this as "required"?
&gt; TIL There are people who have been able to actually use Google Pay. I've started to use it recently and it's been great overall. Most stores will register it as my debit card and prompt me for a pin. I've only been to one store that specifically had a "G Pay" sticker and it was an instant payment.
What level of python would you say this book is for? I just barely started python a couple months ago and I'm trying to get my hands on as much knowledge as I can, but would like to know level of python I should know before I hardcore study your book. thanks ☺️
&gt; their own proprietary system like Wal-Mart I just saw this and I just have to wonder how much adoption they really get. People likely have a low saturation point for all these various payment methods they're putting on their phone and adding cards to... At least I'd hope.
`rsync` is free, simple, scriptable and runs on not only Linux, OSX and Windows but also Android. Additionally, it covers a lot more cases than your code does (links, special files, ssh, nfs, deletion on both ends, etc, etc). That said, it's perfectly valid to rewrite something so you can understand it, or learn python, or just for fun. You should stick to those reasons. The stated reasons are nonsense.
Copy operations are not where you save time, *avoiding* copy operations is where you save time. `rsync` has a lot of experience in figuring out how to do that in various situations. This code almost certainly has not thought of all those ways.
What an embarrassing comment
For me the problem was when I entered my email and tried to ckeck out it threw and error. I had to sign up separately then it worked. 
I've been following this tutorial too. It got me started with flask. Is really well done and the presenter explains clearly.
Is this awesome or what!
Many thanks!
Whats the company name? Also storm proxy is likely not something they are OK with. Id like to avoid those kinds of solutions for the time being, if possible...
sounds like a fun project, i will check it out
Looks like General Assembly has some in-person classes. If you can get that expensed, I would go that route. https://generalassemb.ly/education/python-programming?where=atlanta
Congratulations. You just did something dropbox can't do. They no longer work on encrypted ext4 and yours does. Completely seriously, and un-ironically, you should offer them your code.

I literally just finished a Python Regex tutorial 7 hours ago. Thanks for this! Just in time!
thanks dude, your answer pointed me in the right direction. I got the output using c = (re.findall(**r"\\d+",text**)) print(**", "**.join(c)) &amp;#x200B;
As an avid Python lover and a new Blender user this video made me so excited! Thank you so much!

Just scan the book to get a high-level idea of what regexps can do for you, so you can dive deeper when you need to solve problems relevant to regexps. Many times string processing problems can be solved with built-in functions like `startswith`, `trim`, `split`, etc with no need for regexps at all. Or maybe a high-level parser is better in many cases.
It's working flawlessly now, thanks for the very quick fix ! Unfortunately my reading queue is stuffed for the week-end (I got a pretty big exam on Monday), but'll definitely read it next week. Thanks a bunch for taking the time to write this =)
It seems the problem is with the `JSON` returned by the site, nothing to do with `click`. PS. Your function returns 'broken clouds' when I run it.
The program is correct, you copied it incorrectly.
contact me, I would like to talk this thru a bit more. akazemi82@gmail.com
Dataprovider, but they only deal with larger companies aka large volume. 7000 companies or queries is a joke to them.
Have you even attempted this yourself...
broken clouds sounds like a correct forecast for London. What did you change to get it to run? I am aware the json returned by the site is nothing to do with Click. I thought the issue might be with the json, but i've tried testing if the json is returned correctly using httpie -GET and it works fine...howcome it runs for you and not me? I feel i'm missing something still.
Thank you! Will be giving this a thorough read :)

In the same boat here. There are SO many options for bootcamps and classes, and I want to do it right since my company will pay. Haven't been able to decide yet, so have just been taking free classes and working on projects.
From one Python noob, thank you
i thought I'd investigate a bit into the json being received from the site as per suggested by you. It appears the python script is receiving the data fine, as I have just run through that part of the script line by line as the following paste bin shows. &amp;#x200B; [https://pastebin.com/Sq0mDMPf](https://pastebin.com/Sq0mDMPf) &amp;#x200B; I'm very confused.
Thank you so much this was something I was needing for learning regex. Thank you so much! 
Thank you so much for writing this book, I am a computer science student and I am learning to master python and this is exactly what I needed to become a master!
Thank you!
Sorry for the delayed answer, I provided an API Key in the command line since the `api_key` variable in `current_weather` gets set to none otherwise. Now I'm realizing from your post that you did not, try changing the function to this: ```python def current_weather(location, api_key): url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather' query_params = { 'q': location, 'appid': api_key or SAMPLE_API_KEY, } print query_params response = requests.get(url, params=query_params) print response.url return response.json()['weather'][0]['description'] ```
I think OP is saying that he had to rewrite the program above using a function but his function is not working. It would help to see what he tried.
Great to see the full color syntax highlighting in the code examples --- makes it very readable.
If you have a lot of small files, rsync should be faster. You're using os.walk and I know how that performs.

This is what I'll be working on today, thank you!
``` def guess_the_number(n, retries=1): for i in range(retries): guess = input(“guess... “) if guess == n: print(“yay!”) break # or return else: # yeah, for...else loops in python! print(f”it was {n}, moron”) ```
rsync is able to break a large file into chunks and send only the chunks that have changed. OP's code would resend the entire file. Your post shows a misunderstanding of the technical issues involved in this project.
You're still not making any sense. What exactly are you trying to do? I'll bet that it exists in the official API.
I'll do whatever I want for any reason I choose how about that?
rsync is able to chunk a large file and send only the chunks that differ. It will be quicker for large files that get modified. It's also probably quicker for lots of small files on a fast disk, since os.walk is slow as hell. I like your project so please don't take this as criticism. Just clearing up a technical point.
OK, this is really /r/learnpython territory, but anyway: the default, and significantly less heavyweight way than using a VM to make project-specific installs of python packages is using a *virtual environment*. [Since Python 3.3, support for this is built-in into Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), otherwise there is also the popular 3rd-party tool called [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
Thanks for the resource. I use a lot of regex, but for me, regex is a thing that once I get it working, I just stop and leave well enough alone. I'm hoping to use your book to broaden my knowledge. &amp;#x200B;
Maybe something more like [strictyaml](https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml) (which uses ruamel.yaml)?
Os walk may not be the fastest approach but it's a mute point since I really only whipped it up in a day. Once I get my fingers dirty I can optimize the code better and swap it with something else. I could look into faster overwrites as well. As of right now it may be a little archaic but it gets the job done easily.
You might like Plumbum's path objects, which do inherit from `str`.
Thank you for being helpful :) Quick question, is it just a PDF or do you have epub/mobi/azw3 or any other ebook formats? &amp;#x200B;
Why didn't you do with `get-pip` what its output told you to do, and you also already did when you tried to install virtualenv, and add the `--user` option? Alternatively, the last part in [the virtualenv installation instructions](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) shows a way to use it without requiring pip. Finally, the easiest way to make Python work as it should on macOS is, as others have already advised, to use Homebrew to get a Python installation independent from the one integrated into the system.
Mods, please find a way to mail a glitterbomb to anyone who posts unformatted code. 
I see, this makes more sense. I thought the apikey was being set in Def current_weather(location, apikey=SAMPLE_API_KEY) is this not the case as a default then? The tutorial read to me as if apikey was an optional flag a user could put in else it would use the sample.
I didn't say you couldn't do it for any reason. I just said the stated reasons are nonsense. You are free to say they aren't, we are free to disagree.
Will definitely check this out after work! Thank you!
It’s formatted with fenced code standard of markdown. Looks fine to me. Blame reddit
I'm happy with os.path and don't feel the need for any form of path object.
The thing is I used to use rsync on my servers over SSH. But there is currently no open-source, portable GUI for rsync. All of them require installation and also come in pre-compiled binaries. A single script solution with included UI that is cross-platform doesn't exist. Rsync is great but it is more tailored to permanent setups and non-portability.
More like a youtube downloader fed from spotify but cool. Seems very useful I will test it a bit. 
I had somehow missed this - thank you! I'm not a big fan of javascript for doing my actual coding but nothing beats the web for designing nice UIs these days. 
hey, I am a total noob to python and I was trying out your code. I keep on getting a module not found error (no module called library). I'm sure I'm being stupid but what should I do to fix this?
Markdown in practice isn't so much a singular standard as a family of varying implementations. It's a mess compared to reStructuredText in that sense. Code formatting instructions for Reddit are in the sidebar (indent 4 spaces). 
Hey there, the "library" module is the folder present in the GitHub page, it should be in the same folder as init.py
Thanks
RegEx is EVIL. And they're simply not Pythonic; they're Perl-y. There are more Pythonic solutions out there... https://changelog.com/posts/meet-regexpbuilder-verbal-expressions-rich-older-cousin https://pypi.org/project/easy-expressions/0.1.1/ https://github.com/Bogdanp/cursive_re https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/PythonVerbalExpressions
Thank you!
Isn't using selenium a surefire way to get blocked from any search engine?
&gt;if a module uses a,b,c you should import a, b and c. if it imports d and d is not used you are doing it wrong. Yep, that's how I'm usually doing it. And often running 'optimize imports' to clean up unused ones. &gt;import as. Well, In PySide you would do `from PySide import QtCore, QtGui` &amp;#x200B; PySide2 moved all widgets into a new module PySide2.QtWidgets. QtGui is still also used. So are you saying I should do, this? &amp;#x200B; `from PySide import QtGui` `from PySide import QtGui as QtWidgets` Importing it twice under different names? Is it a good practice? In either case I'm using [Qt.py](https://Qt.py) for this now. &amp;#x200B; &gt;because they are wrong, or they don't care, or they are 2 days from the deadline, or they gave the project to the intern who does not know python or they outsourced it to india to three guys who work 14 hours a day to deliver unmaintainable code because that's how they keep customers coming back. &amp;#x200B; Not outsourced, I'm talking about TDs doing it this way. They are all wrong, got it. &amp;#x200B; &gt;You don't write your own licensing system. You buy it. End of story. &amp;#x200B; Could you suggest one? That would work with Python and Maya? &amp;#x200B; &gt;excellent. so now you have IO as a side effect of importing a module. which means that the first time your IO gets stuck for whatever reason importing the module will take forever and make it harder to test because all your code relies on global information rather than passed, local information. &gt; &gt;You don't trigger side effects on import. &amp;#x200B; This is actually an interesting part. I wonder how can I avoid it but still make it read config on load. It is a plugin, it has to do stuff at startup. I suppose I should be using \_\_init\_\_ files for that or what? &amp;#x200B; &gt;So you write bad code so that nobody can reverse engineer it. Got it. &amp;#x200B; Man, you need to relax. I am really getting offended here. Yes I do make some mistakes, but I'm asking stuff here, I'm learning. Part of my questions here were in theory, but you assumed that I'm writing that way. Part of it (like importing PySide and IO on import) are indeed my mistakes which I'm now going to work on. And you're just spitting acid all over. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Ok cool that does clarify my confusion a bit, I was wondering if I was missing something else it could do. But yeah you’re point about “you can say that about anything with python” makes total sense. 
Woah that’s bad. I was on mobile so I found it easier to use backticks. I’ll edit 
yeah really ridiculous. report it please. Some weird accounts that haven't posted in a year, yet drop into the discussion to disagree have commented as well. 
This isn't a true Spotifiy downloader. It takes your playlist and looks it up on YouTube to then download. There are plenty of songs on Spotify that I want, but can't find anywhere else. Not even YouTube.
I am getting a colorama module not found but I have installed it. Any ideas of how to fix? 
RegEx are a specialised micro language that is widely implemented and available/embedded almost anywhere. You learn it (or at least a core set) once and you can use it on the client, in Python, in practically every language. A more pythonic version is useless outside Python. That makes RegEx more valuable as more pythonic solution, as much as I love Python.
If you can, get your company to sponsor a year of O'Reilly's safari membership. You will have access to ton of books and other resources. 
Thank you! I downloaded it and signed up. Much appreciated. :) Will check it out soon.

Anything in particular? ### re.search Finds and returns a match. Only the first match is returned. Example: import re line = "U.S. and Ghana are in the world cup finals." rslt = re.search('(.*) are (.*?) .*', line) if rslt: print('group: ', rslt.group()) print('group 1: ', rslt.group(1)) print('group 2: ', rslt.group(2)) else: print('nothing found') ### re.match Special case version of `re.search` which only looks for a match occuring at the beginning of a string. ### re.sub The re.sub function takes a regular expresion and replace all the matches in the string with the second parameter. In the example, we are searching for all tags ('&lt;.*?&gt;') and replacing them with nothing (''). Example: re.sub('&lt;.*?&gt;', '', string) ### re.split Splits strings on a specific pattern. Fancy version of `str.split(separator, maxsplit)` Example: &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'\W+', 'Words, words, words.') ['Words', 'words', 'words', ''] There is also `re.findall` and `re.finditer` which I can explain if the above was helpful.

Seriously
I did report it. What put it over the top was "omg you should sell this to dropbox" comment.
What if it takes something like 20 minutes to get to the bad part of your code? This way you can debug it immediately instead of setting a breakpoint and waiting another 20 minutes.
Sadly, this does not work, as pip already is the python3 variant
Wait it's not normal to program in 3D?

If you're like me, got here wanting to upgrade pip virtualenv and your OSX refuses to update it, here's what I've done: 1. I basically followed this https://wsvincent.com/install-python3-mac/ (installed python2 with brew, I needed another instance of 2, not py3) 2. By default OSX don't have a *.bash_profile* file, you can do this on terminal but I ended up creating one using text edit (plain text file!!) and saving it on my home dir with this inside: *PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin export PATH PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:"$PATH"* After this, run on the terminal: *$source ~/.bash_profile* and you can check if brew says its all fine for you to go ahead: *$ brew doctor* Should tell you "Your system is ready to brew" You can check your PATH with *$ cat /etc/paths* After checking everything was ok, the line went ok. &gt; python -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv

I should mention that this occurred to me after my own recent intro to Python. I’ve developed in numerous languages in the past and am happy to see how approachable this language is.
Yes. For example, instructions on how to make EXEs for PySimpleGUI are [here](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/#creating-a-windows-exe-file).

Alright sorry for the delay I had a flight to catch. If you're absolutely noob at the Terminal I'm confused as to why you'll need virtualenv to be honest, but that's fine. Homebrew is a package manager. It's excellent. It'll manage and install packages for you on your mac, it's like pip but not just for python. It can also install software. If you want to give this a shot, you can open up a terminal and fire this command to install it: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" When that is done, you can run: brew install python Or, depending on the python version you want, brew install python3 Then you're all good. You will have a python installation in /usr/local/bin and that will be in your path. You can then run your pip command to install virtualenv for your use. I hope that was helpful, feel free to send questions my way if you need to.
Now I get why people say python is pseudocode.

That's exactly what I ended up doing, but with python2 (needed this one, not 3). Already had brew, just had to update it and I had to create the bash_profile thing I didn't had before. After this everything just worked. I needed virtualenv to build a remote deploy on EC2!! Had to run on my machine to make it work, and totally not a python person. Anyway, all went great and I have my thing working, thank you for the kind help!!

Does your son know how to program at all yet? After he completes "Dad's Challenge", if he had fun you might turn him loose on the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). The programming challenges are not super difficult, but it may be a bit too hard for somebody who has zero programming experience. The Challenge is full of fun puzzles and riddles, and gives the challenger a good introduction to a pretty interesting variety of standard Python libraries. Even if your son doesn't enjoy the challenge, you might enjoy it yourself, or it might be something you could both do together, as a father-and-son type activity if he gets stuck.
There's plenty of minecraft-python books and a modified minecraft client that runs python scripts to automate building.
I think he will love that as a future step to understand the connection to code and hardware. I have some extra strips around that he wants to use. Good idea.
Let me know what you do!
We’ll see if he still agrees if he has to quit *and* pay. 🤫
That’s great! I’ll check that out for myself. He has zeroed coding experience. I would love for us to do that together. I look for chances like that. Which explains why I’ve got a #DadsOfFortnite group. It’s done a lot for our relationship. Thanks for the referral!

Seriously, I’m not sure if I should laugh or cry at this code example. I love this level of abstraction. Python’s new slogan, “Get the F— out of my way; I’m already done coding this sheeeet while your IDE is booting up!”
Cool idea, but I don't think I would use speedtest as my data source of choice. Personally, I think I would try to tie it into my router bandwidth monitoring and set a threshold for that over a 1 minute window or something. So if the bandwidth drops below my threshold for an entire minute, change the hue of the bulb. Your approach could still be salvaged I guess if you set this script as a cronjob or schedule it in some way for the period you want to check, but I feel like downloading dummy payloads from the closest server every so often is kind of a waste. Sorry if this was meant to be a joke and you're not actually looking for feedback.
You should meet [home assistant](https://home-assistant.io) 
Can you tell why do you prefer xlswriter? 
This looks really neat— great share
I think a more interesting challenge would be to write a Python program that plays BlackJack, which can actually be beaten by "card counting". (Keeping track of which cards are still left in the dealer's deck, and adjusting the playing strategy, how much to bet and when to "hit" or "stay", based on which cards have already been played. You could start with a simple version that figures out the optimum BlackJack strategy without counting cards, by playing a few tens of thousands of simulated hands, and calculate the best regular strategy, such as "hit on 15 or less, unless the dealer shows a face card, then hit on 17 or less, and double down on any pair of eights or better" (or find whatever the optimum strategy turns out to be according to your simulation). Once you've done that, try adding the "card counting" part. This is definitely possible, and has been used to make a lot of money for a few smart students (check the Wikipedia article MIT Black Jack card counting team). I'm not suggesting you actually try to win money from the casinos using this, but it might be a fun programming challenge. If you want to go for the big money, try to write a program that can successfully make money in the stock market. There is tons of historical stock-market data available online (Yahoo Finance?) so you could test your algorithms before risking any real money.
It's a lot to take in, but this seems to be the one open solution to controlling my xiaomi ir.
if it helps at all im 14 and 1/2 and I absolutely love python and I started a couple years ago :)
RegEX is built into the search/replace of every serious editor and IDE. Is understood by many command line tools and every language with any serious usage. RegEx is pretty much universal. The alternatives, regardless of any other qualities they might have - are not nearly as universally supported. VerbalExpressions are a nice frontend for RegEx. But the universality of RegEx are an unbeatable advantage. And if I have to learn RegEx any than VerbalExpressions are not that much easier to read. The increased verbosity is better to read for people who are not familiar with RegEx, but that's about all. I can take a RegEx and throw it into a tool like regex101.com and test and debug that easily. It's just too universally useful.
Nope; compared the two a few years ago; had trouble learning Openxyl. Xlswriter has [excellent documentation](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/), and a great API, so perhaps that's the reason.
Have him make hotkeys and macros for fortnite, without using autohotkeys or built in functionality in the keyboard. If he asks for help, guide him on what to search for/look for. Next up, challenge him to automate something else in his daily life. Make him see the utility. 
Lol no way I'm giving them my email
&gt; I’m already done coding this sheeeet while your IDE is booting up! Seriously. This morning around 7am at work I was like "huh, I should take a look at that data extraction thing Mike was talking about". By 10am I had it working. This is a backup to a completely different process that took 2 people a year.
Doesn't speedtest have to use your connection to test it?
&gt; So if the bandwidth drops below my threshold for an entire minute, change the hue of the bulb. What if there isn't much traffic in that minute?
Wouldn't pinging say "1.1.1.1" or "8.8.8.8" be more efficient? If you got no reply or you cant open a connection you turn the bulb red
Most likely will be using Github for version control. 
Check out Adventofcode. 
I am pretty sure, that this is not the problem, since arch basically doesn't even have a 32 bit version anymore. And i also checked my gcc, g++ and other tools, they are all 64 bit applications as far as i can tell.
I have a question - I'm also a beginner - Is there a reason why you have "import random" and also "from random, import randint"? Wouldn't import random be sufficient? 
There are many tools online to convert between the different formats. Just takes a simple Google search 
What got you started?

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Oh dear, sorry I missed this. &gt; One could also argue that "explicit is better than implicit", but I wouldn't exactly agree with that because I also find the API messy Exactly! But to me, messy is an understatement, especially when starting on more complex applications. &gt; Having a blocking infinite loop is pretty much necessary to handle events asynchronously, the difference is how much effort the language makes to hide it from you by creating another thread. Python never spawns more processes/threads if not explicitly told. *Right*, and perhaps I am in the minority, but my default mental idea of an async event loop is "by default it will be on a new thread". Which IIRC is how C# implements their task factories, it definitely is how Ruby does async stuff. And JS does it similarly (except, it works on a larger event loop and specially schedules on the microtask queue rather than the macrotask one).

I don't know if it is the "best" but it's suitable for ordinary spreadsheets. It depends on your use case. Make sure to test your input scenarios if using it to read spreadsheets. It can get very slow creating huge spreadsheets with hundreds of thousands of rows and dozens of columns.
When I was 14, I had lost interest in coding and focused almost entirely on maths and chem/physics (FWIW I'm a maths 'major' who got into coding last year). I think if my father had pushed me to code in a 'day challenge' sort of way (especially if it is in a /r/FellowKids way, noting the '#python'), it would not have helped, because my father would not have related it to what I enjoyed at the time. I know that this is a minority opinion, but just my tuppenceworth: Python doesn't necessarily need to be learnt from 'hello world' tutorials (and personally for those I would avoid youtube for the most part - it is hard to find those who are good programmers, good communicators, and also insightful commentators). The most *interesting* way to learn it is through having projects you are genuinely invested in that Python helps you with. Smashing together lots of projects is probably not the most *efficient* way to learn, for a person motivated enough to sit down and RTFM - but imo it is the most likely to kickstart a teenager's interest in it. E.g. setting up a website backend with Flask (running on gunicorn running on nginx perhaps, but I suggest you set those parts up) that streams a webcam or something; or using OpenCV to do facial recognition - which could be eventually extended to an engineering project, of building a raspberry pi on wheels that can navigate the floor of a building. Python doesn't even need to be the core of each project. For instance, a relatively python-light project would be setting up something in Blender (free 3D rendering software) - for demonstrations of various physics perhaps, making his own game where a character drives a car (engineering), or even just making a neat scifi scene of spaceships flying around and using python to code some of the explosions. Just don't tell him about nodes, because that's cheating. Also teach your son good Googlefu early on. He will many encounter errors, and while you are hopefully there as a port of call, he should feel increasingly as though he is able to fix his own code, even if - initially - through copy/pasting from stackexchange/stackoverflow. Show him how to make nice-looking code, and help him keep it that way, but don't be a PEP8 Nazi (especially with the rules that make the code less readable in modern environments).
Great! Just checking 😉
several reasons: 1.i was fascinated by how I can type and the computer does what I tell it to do 2.I could make my own game with everything I want in it 3.i can add anything I want in my games instead of waiting for other devs of games I like to update the game with thinks I wont like plus some other stuff Ive been self teaching myself ever since
which bulb do you have??
Optionally you can use pyenv. It makes managing python versions a breeze. ``` brew install pyenv ```
Thank you! 
tell him if he does it right he wont have to do homework ever again. source: i am a computer engg student and have automated my online assignments and a lot more stuff.
You are forgetting about C extensions, so obviously people get annoyed. C/C++ and python goes hand in hand. I came from C/C++ myself. Obviously if you render a fractal with pure python code it's going to get slow. Also, this has been posted before.
Thank you, Sundeep!
You're right, that approach doesn't really accomplish what OP is looking for, which appears to be theoretical download speeds. I was trying to think of a way to monitor connection quality without tying it to some arbitrary source (in this case the closest speedtest.net server if that's the library I think it is) and having to download dummy data all the time. Was trying to come up with a use case that would actually be practical, like if I were watching netflix, or playing PS4 and wanted to know whether my connection to the servers were poor (since most PS4 games don't give you ping in game). I rarely use speedtest to gauge my connection quality as it doesn't really tell you the whole story.
Yea, that's certainly more efficient if all you're interested in is whether or not you can connect.
Pretty much the same for me. I think xlsxwriter was the succesor to xlwt, so it was easy to figure out.
"That's what" - she
I was a teacher for a few years and studied education. Not sure what exactly you're trying to accomplish here, but extrinsic motivators like money are a really shit way to build a long term interest. You may be accomplishing the opposite of what you want. You won't hear that here though. Consider asking an education subreddit.

Ha! You’ve never met my son. He’s had to be dragged kicking and screaming into what quickly became his favorite things in life. It’s a thing parents and teachers understand. But if there’s one thing my son likes more than money, it’s showing that he’s smarter than his old man. So he has the OPTION to take on both. And truth is - even if he fails, he won’t owe me anything. But I want the discovery to be his. The challenge is just us doing what we do. You should see him embarrass me when I Game with him. Lol.

While it's not written in Python (it's just docker and bash) it is useful for packaging/deploying python cli/web apps. I found that [xar](https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar) by Facebook is very cool, but it requires building some binaries that you can't just `apt install` so I spent some time figuring out how to compile them statically, results are here: [https://github.com/Kirill888/static-xarexec](https://github.com/Kirill888/static-xarexec)
Thanks a lot, happy learning :)
For now it is only PDF. I hope to make epub/mobi formats available for next version. I am not that familiar with pandoc and I was facing issues while trying to generate epub format.
That is great to hear :)
I would suggest this after finishing a basic course on Python - it is mentioned as a prerequisite Apart from being familiar with basic programming concepts and Python syntax, you'd need to know features like list comprehension and string methods. Feel free to ask me if you are stuck, happy learning :)
I use openxyl for almost everything from creating to configuring software (when bosses can’t be bothered to do anything with JSON files, but they know how to use Excel). It really is feature rich. Very Pythonic implementation, so if you think in python, but need to read/write Excel files, it’s pretty solid.
I have a friend who grows micro-greens and is interested in automating the water flow etc, I looked into this for them and only found info on using PLC's and ladder logic. Could you point me in the right direction of using Python to do this?
You can do a lot of things: - add features to the application like new file format exporters and importers - pipeline integrations - automating repetitive actions like setting up rigs python is one of the major backbones of the film and games industry Here's some articles I wrote on uses for python http://dgovil.com/blog/2016/11/30/python-for-feature-film/
Few days ago here was discussion about learning programming... It is harder than it seems to teach programming (and in general) - learning something in one day is not serious task. I don't know what is your background, but you probably know Python, take any language you don't know and learn it in one day. Now imagine somebody who has no background in coding. 
Fortnite tracker has an api. Ask him to make a rest request that returns some stats and prints them when he runs the scripts. Bonus points if it handles text entry for the player name
Thank you!
Breadcrumb rewards for gaining basic competency. Bigger rewards for researching, and then implementing a project that he creates in his imagination. You need basic mastery just to navigate the computing ecosystem and your language of choice. Taking a project from imagination to reality is the real alchemy, though, and that requires a whole set of skills you only really learn from doing. Catalyze that journey for him, and he'll probably not look back. You might even get to go on part of it with him.
Pay you $100 😉
Why not just have the dict? Why wrap this as an object?
No, I agree. I don’t know Python, but I know a handful of others. This is really where my head was. Like what would be simple enough but still rewarding. 
Now you just need to hook up a klaxon to start sounding when the connection drops entirely!
Mean thing would be to replace main os with gentoo, delete package manager and have him code his own with python. Can't make a windows USB or other type without packages 😈
Maybe something for /r/LearnPython ?
Probably, the most obvious answers is because there are already features that accomplish this much more easily. I may not be understanding completely the purpose you are trying to achieve but class attributes are completely mutable and you can add any value to any name space in the class so long as you do not mess with \_\_slots\_\_. class MyClass: x = 10 &amp;#x200B; class = MyClass() class.meta = font\_size &amp;#x200B; this works and simply adds an attribute to the class. &amp;#x200B; As for dumping to json you can always use the json package which has a json.dumps () and dump \_\_dict\_\_ attribute from the class into it. This is a pretty common solution to classes with attributes you might want to store they have a pretty good example at [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768895/how-to-make-a-class-json-serializable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768895/how-to-make-a-class-json-serializable)
Hey I hate regex because 99% of the time I see them used it could be easily replaced by a simple string search or using other tools in the python standard library. 
A pattern I really like: ``` import argparse from bdb import BdbQuit import logging def main(*args, **kwargs): # Do your business here if __name__ == "__main__": parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument(--with_debugger, action='store_true') args = parser.parse_args() try: args, kwargs = # unpack your shit from the arg parser main(*args, **kwargs) except (BdbQuit, KeyboardInterrupt): raise except Exception as e: if args.with_debugger: import pdb import traceback traceback.print_exc() pdb.post_mortem() else: logging.exception("Uncaught exception {}".format(e)) raise ``` This has worked for me for all but distributed applications where you need more sophisticated tooling. You can use a block like this with pretty much any CLI utility you like as well, not just raw python scripts. 
It has 2 columns and will be a breeze reading it and converti g it to arrays for processing
Largely because my real classes will have methods that perform calculations using some of the attributes. I would subclass this and add all those specific methods there. They'll all interact with one another but I want to keep cohesion high. Having all the attributes for my classes in a dictionary in a config file seemed like a good way to ensure I don't unintentionally duplicate something across classes. (I suppose that could be more of a workflow problem) Having that THING_ATTRS dict where the values are types also makes it really easy to do attribute type validation.
Wouldn't that simply add that particular .meta attribute to that instance? and not to the class? I feel that could lead to having too many one-off attributes that may not be on all instances of that class.
You can get him to complete automate the boring stuff or Build games with python book. Even the cracking codes with python is a great challenge to solve.
You could show him how to have Python do his homework for him and maybe teach him some marplotlib to let him see data in action. &gt;Maybe incorporate Fortnite or some game play data? Gameplay data is really boring. You could make him quit video games alone by making him graph data from the video games he plays. People play games to clear their mind, not to fill it. Do something interesting like "Gender ratios of \[insert workforce he likes\]", "Average work hours of \[insert carrier he likes\]", "My favorite games by excitement factor", etc... Don't just give him a video and say "Learn from this". He would feel like he is trapped in a dungeon of terror. You actually have to spend time with him programming the thing **HE WANTS** and go through it slowly until he has an good idea of what you are doing. You are programming together, not just you, not just him since he doesn't know programming yet. Python doing his homework is a easy thing to draw him into while still keeping it basic. It might also help him understand the math more by programming it. It would peak my interest for sure considering how repetitive the homework felt in 8th vs high school. &amp;#x200B; TLDR; Go to r/learnpython and help him program stuff that could be useful for him like homework. It's hard to get a 8th grader to pay attention while sitting down for so long, especially if they play sports. 
What kind of assignments? Haha
Im currently in a data science immersive bootcamp and jupyterlab will defitely give you an edge. Dynamic spreadsheet load, tabs, and running code windows side by side is se magnifique... Theres so much functionality and streamlined workflows... Nteract is a much simpler alternative but when u get into the gritty of it, you will really want jupyterlab in the end. 
In addition you may want to check out the yellow brick library. It has some choice EDA charts and a more palatable confusion matrix. Its a bit too verbose for a library but it will be worth looking into. 
I’d ask him how he wants to work the cost off. There is no sense in forcing something down his throat he isn’t interested in. Your attitude parallels those that believe everything body should learn or can learn to code which I find to be rediculous. As for the next time around I wouldn’t buy him a thing. Instead give him options to earn money on his own. Frankly I’m not sure if it is a good idea for a kid to be given stuff like this, I got nothings not from my parents except at Christmas time and enough clothes to attend school. It really teaches the value in working, setting goals and using your ingenuity. 
Yo this is really helpful. Mind explaining re. findall, re.finditer and re.group/s?
I think kid would love it and Dad can boost his status among other kids in school justby teaching him how to scrape porn vids lmao
Honestly the most useful resource I've found was searching for code samples on github.
I'm not sure really. I couldn't get it to work with just "Import Random" but when I added "From random import randint" it did seem to work.
Spreading misinformation about what a tuple is should go nowhere. Especially propagating the misunderstanding that parenthesis is what makes a tuple should be banished to the nether parts of hell.
I'm only a begginer but find out what he likes or does as a hobby. If he likes gaming tell him to make a simple game as that will teach a lot of stuff in python such as functions classes and even as simple as variables. It'll also teach him how to read and write to databases. If he watches sport tell him to make a Web scraper that gets live results from the game. But that's just what I think. You mightve already tried it. 
 import bankaccount bankaccount.deposit(100)
You could do something like this, but it would probably be more user-friendly as a subclass of a dict (well, easier to use subclass [Mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping), but same idea), or by using `__getattr__` or `__getattribute__` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__)). However, if I'm understanding what you're trying to do, I think a [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) would be the best fit for what you're looking for here, especially when used with type hinting.
I'd agree if OP was saying heres $100 if you study python for a day. Really he's saying I'm gonna let you off a $100 debt which is really just a cute thing, no kid actually owes their parents money unless they're strict as hell. 
Is there only ever going to be one instance of Thing() ?
I started python at age 6, it's never too early to start. I used to love making little console games, and then I moved on to GUI things. After that I learned to use pygame. My first really proud project was when I made 2 player pomg complete from scratch in python and pygame at age 8. GUI stuff really caught my interest at a young age though. Try incorporating that.
There will be many Things instantiated all at the same time.
Ooh, all of those are very neat. And good reasons to argue for an upgrade from 2.7. So it seems the consensus is that I'm not insane to want to do this and its not a TERRIBLE idea, but there are better ways to go about it. Thank you for the reply.
Check out the [Github page](https://github.com/makkoncept/pyvoc) for installation and usage. This is my first serious CLI, so any recommendation is most welcomed. You can reply here or make an issue on github. Thanks!
Will any of these [projects](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/) work?

As you can see, it is not. If you do expect the dict to be shared, what benefits do you think you're getting out of a class than another approach?

MTR to the DNS server. Change colors based packet loss/latency. Of course, that requires actually coding (probably)
Nice job! Regular expressions are great to have in our Dev toolboxes.
Nice ;)
No problem ! And thanks for the tips. I just published r/LearnPython
Got a link for any of those? That'd be ideal for my kiddo...
That's basically the Stripe library. :D
Amazing sir!
Anything fast
Your internet will be bad every time this runs :D Put this in a cronjob while playing some multiplayer games or streaming some content.
I'm copying the data from the init_dict into a local data_dict using the keys from the attr_dict, so I'm not expecting it to be shared among the instances. I'm not entirely certain I'll be doing anything with this, which is why I wanted to ask around. For background: I was building an internal website in Py2.7 and kept having the spec change to store more data, but not calculate with that data. It was getting tiresome to keep adding attributes and then adding it again for type validation. It occurred to me I could do it this way and tie the attribute 'declaration' with a type. It appears that Python3 has addressed this issue in a much more concise manner. Thank you for your reply
I managed to upload my first PyPI project yesterday :) 
Ah seeing blender brings memories about how I started using python. It's approximately 9 years back, when I was trying to learn how to animate using blender. Python 2 was a dependency of blender. Since it was so simple I thought python ide was a calculator and used it as a calculator for like 3 years.
Can you link what py3 feature resolved this? 
Also, if you're using Python 3 you can now use f strings for printing... print(f'My var is equal to {var}') 
You just "reinvented" python internals. Attributes are internally stored in a dict named \_\_dict\_\_ class c: pass o = c() 
like 10-15 questions based on a topic , we get like 12 assignments per week.
I attended a very small school for K-6. When I was in the second and third, my teacher had a system to encourage us to read. For every book we read, she gave us a certain amount of play money. On Friday, she opened the "store", and we could exchange the money for plastic trinkets that she kept. For several months, I forced myself to read books that gave me the greatest payout for the least effort. There was a little girl in my class who was willing to read chapter books, which paid the most, but were of course a lot of work. More work than I was willing to do, and anyway most of the chapter books my teacher had were about Hank the Cowdog, which I disliked. She ended up amassing quite a fortune, and I began to feel competitive. So, one day I decided to bite the bullet and read a chapter book. I picked The BFG, which our teacher had been reading aloud to us. I took it home over the weekend and discovered to my amazement that I actually enjoyed reading it. That experience created a love of reading that has lasted my entire life and no doubt has resulted in all kinds of positive outcomes for me. Im also skeptical about the value of "extrinsic" motivation. But it's definitely tempered by the knowledge that it worked just fine for me.
Thanks. Much appreciated. =)
How does the program answer them?
From this [reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/af3p2d/is_there_a_reason_i_shouldnt_class_with_dict_for/edvivnt/) While I haven't fully explored them, it looks like the dataclass with type hinting is almost the same thing. Central location of attributes with type validation. It's not central to a config file, but close, add it in one spot and be done. I think I could see a way to make it fit my needs. Alas I'm stuck in 2.7 Thank you for your reply
Why use `/ 1024 / 1024` instead of `/ 1048576`?
Google or searches terms in ebooks which I read from . I do have to check the answers. I can like select from various sources.
Not OP, but the logic behind / 1024 / 1024 seems a lot more clear and readable than / 1048575
I am aware of that, but converting PDF to epub or mobi just creates a mess out of coding books
‘Cause it is more simple to understand and makes code more readable. It’s the same thing when you use time.sleep(), if you want to sleep for one hour, it is better to use `time.sleep(60 * 60)` than `time.sleep(3600)`
I feel like something similar could work well in a home setting. Encourage your kid to do what you want, reward them, and teach them the value of money for “work.”
If you import random, it'll work, but you just have to call random.randint instead.
Nice. Sounds like I need to look into something similar.
Hey, this is cool. Where are you pulling the definitions from, though? 
Downvoted for posting an image instead of copying and pasting text from a terminal session. Is Photoshop your command line? Images (especially animated GIFs) are harmful because: - they are hostile to the visually impaired and blind, who can use screen readers with text but not images; - coloured text are not relevant and can be hostile to the 5% of men (and tiny fraction of a percent of women) with colour-blindness); - being able to copy and paste examples is great -- now try copying and pasting an example in an image; - people can take as much, or as little, time to read text as they need; with an animated GIF, they only have the time hard-coded into the animation and it is impossible to choose a speed that will satisfy everyone. 
 time.sleep(3600) # 1 hour
Google colab was one of the alternatives that we found. Will definitely check it out. Thanks!
Cool , its really easy just convert doc file to plain text , then do stuff line by line. gl
Yeah, but if you want to change 1h to 55 mins you would have to open the calculator, change number and comment. Otherwise it’s more simple to go from `time.sleep(60 * 60)` to `time.sleep(60 * 55)` 
&gt; It was getting tiresome to keep adding attributes and then adding it again for type validation. Do you need to do type validation? What does it give you that duck-typing doesn't?
That would be overwngineering IMO, anyway the speed test isn’t for while you’re watching Netflix, it’s for before so you can know if you have a good enough connection to stream or you need to watch something pre-downloaded instead. And yes you would run the script as a cron job or with a CI tool.
I've got the full bundle. I'm a Python beginner but I think what they offer in this specific case is a good value.
Yes, but one of the pythonic philosophies is that you're going to read it more often than you are going to change it, and time.sleep(3300) # 55 minutes is still more readable. And in vim you just type `ci(^R=60*55^M^[`.
He posted a link to his Github page with text examples so i don't see any problem with that.
&gt;oing something si keep us posted!
[Python is not Java.](https://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html) Writing getters and setters like this is probably a bad idea, and it will certainly hurt performance. One problem with your getter: it returns `False` if the attribute doesn't exist, but it also returns `False` if the attribute exists and is set to False. Your attribute checker does way too much work. You have: def attr_exists(self, attr): """check if an attribute is in the attr_dict""" ret_val = False if attr in self.attr_dict.keys(): ret_val = True return ret_val That should be: def attr_exists(self, attr): """check if an attribute is in the attr_dict""" return attr in self.attr_dict Or better still, it shouldn't exist at all. Why do you need it? Your class doesn't use it, and it is not a nice interface for the caller. The caller wants to say things like: instance.attribute but you force them to write things like: instance.get_attr("attribute") Yuck yuck yuck yuck. Speaking of getters, your getter also does a lot of unnecessary work. Here's a minimal version: def get_attr(self, attr): """get the value of an individual attribute""" return self.attr_dict[attr] A better version would allow an optional default: # Define a global constant. _SENTINEL = object() def get_attr(self, attr, default=_SENTINEL): """get the value of an individual attribute""" if default is _SENTINEL: return self.attr_dict[attr] return self.attr_dict.get(attr, default) Your setter shouldn't return True or False. Returning a success/failure flag is an anti-pattern, because the caller will forget to check it. Like a samurai, it should return victorious (in success), or not at all (raise an exception). There's probably no need to use things like `types.DictType` when you can just use the built-in `dict`. Same for `types.IntType` (`int`) and `types.StringType` (`str`). Unless you can give a reason why you should use the longer name, stick to the built-in name. 
Its actually quite easy to use after you get over initial "wow thats a lot to take in" effect. It then jsut turns into reading components docs and copy pasting stuff. And yaml is great.
Thank you very much:) It's using Oxford dictionary API. It's a very good API and used by Google too when we search meaning of any word.
A nice. I'll definitely look into that at some point. Great work. 
Packt has a pretty low reputation when it comes to publications. I purchased a python bundle little over a year ago because it covered microservices and was hugely disappointed in it. The price is low, but I highly question the content. Purchase at your own risk.

This is not Fortnite but here is a Minecraft type game and instructions completely in Python: https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft New version coming out soon. 
I just installed blender for the first time on my linux desktop and the interface isn't at all like the one in the video. Any videos on how to get there?
Programming philosphy for me is: Code should self explanatory, if not add comments.
Yes I installed python 3
Could you describe the setup to me please? Like, which smart bulb and how is the code connected to it etc? Cheers 
It's beautiful isnt it?

Create an ERP, it’s fun and you’ll learn a lot
I'd try to find something he couldn't possibly solve without some coding, but that's simple and challenging at the same time. To show what a little programming can do, I once wrote a little script "profiling" the people in a WhatsApp group I was in. You can download the chat history as a text file and work with that. Each line of text contains a timestamp, username and the actual message... Sky is the limit, but its fun how much you can do with this... when are certain people going to sleep? Who is starting most conversations? What weekday/hour of day has most acitivity? Who is using most words per message? Who is using most curse words? 
Whats an erp?
Ok thanks!
I also purchased the bundle, I am a bit experienced with python and the books are not exactly impressive, especially the code since the books are in digital form it could be much more well presented. The price is tempting though for what they offer. You can also download 6-7 videos if I remember correctly which I haven't seen yet.
Oof, forget about the broomstick, you have have the whole closet up your ass.
Thanks! 
This is duplicating information which is a bad thing. Someone can change the argument without updating the comment.
Do your studies distinguish between a school teacher and a dad? I had a teacher had school who taught me programming. I was shit at computers and hated it, but programming seemed simple. It was methodological, and logical. If you tell the computer to tell something, the computer does exactly what you told it to. If you didn't get the expected results, you need to improve what you told it. She used to say 3-4 hours after the school ended, just to make sure that I got enough lab time to tinker and play along with programming (I couldn't afford a computer back home). She would go home 3-4 hours late everyday! She didn't help me much during the extra labs, but she would just sit with me, give me challenging problems to solve and keep encouraging me with a smile. She didn't pay me any money, didn't provide any incentives at all! All she did was show that she cared. I'm indebted to her, and I can never pay that debt back. All I can do is take her example and pass it forward. Would I've been equally thankful, had it been my dad doing the same for me? Most certainly not! I would just expect him to do so, or I might even look at it as a punishment: why on Earth do I have to stay 3 hours more in school everyday and solve these difficult puzzles? Dads and teachers are different. A monetary incentive might not be the best incentive, but it works.
i hate code golf, iit's a great idea and always starts fun but sadly in the end everyone is just using sys calls and the most horrible formatting and hacks to get the win. 
Yeah but those are the nuances of that particular coding language. It exposes and pushes you to explore different new things about the programming language that you might not learn while you are coding normally. 
Openpyxl is the best Python library to use for reading/creating worksheets IMO. If you need an interactive spreadsheet (click on a button and update a cell), then xlwings is the only viable option. 
Google is your best friend. Google what an ERP is. If you are lazy: http://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/what-is-erp.shtml
Surprised to not find `groupdict` anywhere.
Thanks!
well, i agree you can learn something from it. But i wouldn't value it more than any other code review, looking deep into your own or other peoples solution always comes with the possibility of learning something. I just don't like the metric code golf uses, in my opinion it rewards bad style and hard to understand code. Back in the days when i was younger and felt like a god among programmers i really loved that strange code that somehow works, but now i've kinda outgrown it and my appreciation for good comments and understandable code has grown exponentially. And i'd say code golf could be improved easily by just not counting comments, new lines and counting names always as one character and maybe disallowing sys calls. I think there's some leagues that do that, but i guess some of the tasks are about smart sys call use so it is probably personal preference. Basically i want to see nice and clean smart solutions instead of horrible boring solutions (my opinion about sys calls in most challenges).
No problem! It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but there are probably ways to make it easier to work with. Fwiw, `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are also available in 2.7 ([docs](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__)) That said, I'd definitely recommend looking at upgrading to py3, regardless of whether you want to use dataclasses or type hinting. The main reason is that py2.7 won't be maintained past the end of the year. It sounds like a leap, but really it's not a massive change to go to py3, and the hassle is definitely worth the benefits; sane character encoding is one of the most obvious ones, your code will still be running on a supported release this time next year, and most libraries you may want to use will be ditching 2.7 soon, if they haven't already. System dependencies aren't a reason to hold you back either these days - with pyenv and virtualenvs it's pretty painless to run multiple versions. I'd definitely say it's worth the investment now - really imo anything written this year should be in py3.
Good job!
yeah, few things were left out.. there's conditional grouping not yet added, and many features from regex module.. and I've some more ideas for exercises and some lengthy case studies, etc for groupdict, I did add a further reading link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11103856/re-findall-which-returns-a-dict-of-named-capturing-groups it was taking too long, so I released what I felt was good enough first version 
Thank you !!
Happy I could help! Best of luck with your future work.
A simple database management systems. The fundamental CRUD user interface. SQLite3 as the database backend. Maybe XML exporter.
I made simillar cli tool last week, except yours look better. Great job! I will take look into code later on today, hope I will learn something new!
There are languages, which are more like a tool. For example "Processing" or variations of Logo language (there's "turtle" module in Python) - student can apply knowledge in other areas almost directly to the code. But still not in one day and the teacher need serious preparation, if you not familiar with Python, don't use it for your task. "Simple enough" can be to take something like Processing, write simple code which is drawing something and ask to modify it using given set of operations. My favorite is Logo (I don't remember which is the best implementation currently, from my head I remember StarLogo, eToys is a bit different thing but at start point can be counted as Logo dialect and it isn't outdated). Whatever you choose you need to learn it first and prepare the lesson (better to base it on some existing tutorial). To load student with extra information, like listening to YouTube for a day or even an hour, is a direct way to Hell. Here is an example what you can do (you is the student). Use eToys (visual programming) Learning stage: Combine commands repeat 4( forward 100; left 90) - you will get a square shape. For your son you will need to explain what each step does. Exercise: Take a paper and write down steps to draw triangle (using the square example). Review them and put in the code - try to run. There is a high chance that you will be surprised with result. Exercise: Draw hexagon Exercise: Draw circle Then you have different commands for control flow or input (sensors) etc. 
Could of probably got the same point across in a less confrontational way dude.
Complaining that the code you write is not readable when code-golfing is like complaining that you miss the story when speedrunning a video game. You are using the same tool but it is a completely different activity. Once you get past the initial *wow that's some ugly code* reaction, you get into a completely different way to think about code. You start thinking really hard about things like *can I move things around*, *isn't there a different language construct I could use*,.. With code-golfing I got to dive deep into some python syntax/API and I discovered new neat python tricks applicable to everyday code. That's really valuable. Plus the kick you get when you save one character by applying some crazy trick is really nice.
hey Thanks! Is you cli tool open source? Can you provide the link? I would love to see how you solved the problems and structured your project
No, not yet. It is really sloppy and I will be really ashamed sharing it. I’ll try to refactor it next week and then I can try share the code with you 
I can't agree more !! That's why I said that it is totally addictive. It's like a testosterone rush to get it to lesser and lesser characters. 
r/learnpython
okay. by the way, you can view other good open source projects, this really helps in refactoring. some projects that helped : - [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi/) - [spotify downloader](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader) - [SoundScrape](https://github.com/Miserlou/SoundScrape) all the best!
Thanks, I will check also those. Usually I dont care about quality of my code as long as I dont need to share it with others. There is nothing wrong with slopiness as long as you get your job done, thats what I think :)
You might have better luck at a kivy related forum. 
Shouldn't `(speedtest.download() / 1024 / 1024)` be `(speedtest.download() / 1000 / 1000)` instead? I doubt pyspeedtest reports Mib instead of Mb
And it should be `/ 1000 / 1000`. Pyspeedtest returns Mb, not Mib

Most programmers I know about that got into programming early had an incentive to do so. Minecraft is a really cool way through Java programming. As long as he's fairly challenged and not given too big or small obstacles (medium size is good) I think you'll manage to expose him to the lovely aspect side of programming. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
