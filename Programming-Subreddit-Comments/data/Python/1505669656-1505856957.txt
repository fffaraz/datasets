I'm working on an API for the scheduling software we use at work. They use SOAP so every request I send requires XML formatting, so I'm working on the logic to create xml schema structures using (potentially nested) dictionaries so whoever is using my API doesn't need to learn how to use pythons standard XML pacajge, which I feel is a bit cumbersome for such a basic task. 
I have a Google News section for "Python". So, every week I get ~6 batshit crazy stories about someone getting attacked by a Python in Florida or something.
Where is the fun in pandas? I thought the fun was about bigger than ram graph data.
Are you interested in collaborators? I could see if there's any interest in automating account creation for new hires. 
Should be a separate repo, really. With a README on how to report snippets of Python that don't pass through 2to3 successfully.
It guarantees the closing token is in the proper place. It isn't a mechanism to make you more efficient by saving you from typing the char. It saves you from getting deep into a chain of statements and needing to rethink it from scratch to figure out which bracket you're closing.
You think they don't pay anyone at all fixing bugs in it? Just run stock 1.5.2 and pray?
Impressive! Could you provide the source code ? Thanks !
Why is your traceback pointing to the 2.7 site-packages? Aren't you supposed to be running a 3x interpreter here? Maybe I'm missing something.

What? Python has the best official docs out of any language I know (JS, C, C++, Matlab, Java). Are you a newbie? 
I just got coverage reports back from a small script I'm writing for use on network routers and my coverage is at 50%. Pycharm has a pretty sweet representation of covered code and makes it kinda fun to visualize what I need to get in a still cover. It's like a game to me now. I'm aiming for like 90% coverage, then seeing if I can make my code a bit more testable.
Yes I can. I do not know if I have yet exactly the figure that I uploaded, but I have others slight different but the main idea is the same. I will "clean" the code first (lots of useless remarks and junk code) then I post it tomorrow. 
I like the described behavior, but it sounds fairly close to the word boundary movement from Ctrl+arrow. I haven't used eclipse enough to know what difference between the two to really have an opinion on which is better. There are a few jetbrains employees floating around here. Try reaching out to one of them. I managed to get some ssh improvements implemented after bringing them up the same way you have here.

pandas is strictly in-memory. But you can use dask for larger-than-memory pandas dataframes.

&gt; Matlab I'll disagree. Nothing is better than Mathworks documentation. I like documentation by example. Python gives you the dry, technically correct verbiage behind how something works. Matlab says: "Here, copy paste this and it'll work". To the point that the workspace is designed to automatically strip ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` from any copy and pasted commands. Even with most Python examples you can't just copy and paste a chunk of an example from the web or documentation because you need to clean off ```&gt;&gt;&gt;``` first.
You can already have two modules importing each other. This is just for a specific case where you are using absolute imports while also binding to a different name which caused issues with circular imports earlier
Last I checked they just do **kwargs though, so this wouldn't really make much of a difference in that case except if you actually had to send that many params. (I tried to fix their code gen to put in actual params instead of just **kwargs, but I didn't manage to go all the way to fixing their code before getting sick of it and they didn't care so that project went nowhere :( )
Pardon my noobness but i dont understand what you mean by "running a 3x interpreter here" and "trackback pointing to" From the instructions on memex explorer github, I created a conda environment called memex. And then django is installed in /python2.7/sitepackages. And the version of django installed is 1.7.3 
&gt; Guido hasn't vetoed it yet Is there ever going to be a point where we don't have to worry about this sort of thing? Now, I get that he's the creator. He's done a lot of really amazing work, and he's clearly an extremely talented individual. But there have been a number of times in my (admittedly limited until recently) experience with python where I've come across something that made me scratch my head as to why it was that way, I do some digging, and more often than not, it's due to some Guido decree from on high that it shall be thus. There's *usually* a subjective argument involved where I can at least see his train of thought, but not all the time. At what point in a languages maturity do the reins naturally transition away from the inventor and into the hands of some central committee that can vote on changes without having a dictator overrule them?
Regarding the locale changes: How does Python deal with non-C locales these days. I remember that back in the bad old days of Python 2.6, one had to jump through hoops to simply get Python to respect the LANG and the other locale environment variables. What does one have to do these days to make Python by default use whatever character set LANG says to use?
Nice I'll give this a go. For your next trick how about a tool that automatically synchronises them :D
&gt;the dry, technically correct verbiage behind how something works. Take a look at docs on [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re) as an example: The docs start by introducing regex, teach you the special characters and their functions in a clear way. Module doc has comprehensive explanation of how each object/function is used and often includes examples that demonstrate how they work. It even explicitly explains things that an user might find unclear, like what is the difference between search() vs. match(). If I know what I want to do finding out how is very easy. As for Matlab the copy/paste approach breaks down as soon as you want to do something even a bit different or more complex, and then the docs stop being so nice. Not to mention copy/pasting code is a really bad practice in general. But even then the official python doc has plenty of examples for the basic usage.
Had you programmed prior to doing the analysis on the Excel files, or was that your intro to programming?
`base64.b64decode` returns `bytes` in Python 3. Iterating over a `bytes` object gives you values of each byte as integers.
&gt; Python still has some rough spots. Package management and distribution could be easier. Personally, I think package management in Python is pretty good, especially with Pip and requirements files. Hell, Go still haven't gotten package management sorted out. And I still find people who think the best way to share C or C++ libraries for Arduino project is to download zip files. It's a real swamp out there for some languages.

Take [this example for re.sub](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub). Trying that out requires 3 separate copy and pastes just to do *one* example. Or you have to put it in an intermediate file, clean it up then paste it in. The examples are also grouped by sub function not by what they do. Compare that page to Matlab's docs for regexp. https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/regexp.html You have a short description of calling methods with some examples. Then, most importantly (and where Matlab shines) is the grouping of examples and in a simple English a description of what it does. With code that you can copy and paste directly into your program / the command window. Python's documentation is written for people that want technical documentation and know what they're looking for. (CS) Matlab's documentation is written for people that want use case examples and don't know what they're looking for. (Engineers) Matlab's examples: - Find Patterns in Text - Find Patterns in Multiple Pieces of Text - Return Substrings Using match Keyword - Split Text at Delimiter Using split Keyword - Return Both Matching and Nonmatching Substrings - Capture Substrings of Matches Using Ordinal Tokens - Capture Substrings of Matches Using Named Tokens - Perform Case-Insensitive Matches - Parse Text with Newline Characters - Return Matches in Cell Python's: - 6.2.5.1. Checking for a Pair - 6.2.5.2. Simulating scanf() - 6.2.5.3. search() vs. match() - 6.2.5.4. Making a Phonebook - 6.2.5.5. Text Munging - 6.2.5.6. Finding all Adverbs - 6.2.5.7. Finding all Adverbs and their Positions - 6.2.5.8. Raw String Notation - 6.2.5.9. Writing a Tokenizer And now reading that it can also be misleading, "Find all Adverbs" is really "Find all words that end in -ly", which is not what the example heading is. I like Python's technical documentation *when I need it*. But much prefer the short, terse straight forward Matlab documentation. A *lot* of what turns my Peers off of Python is that just reading the documentation to get started is time consuming. Another comparison of docs is [numpy's linspace](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) vs [Matlab's linspace](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/linspace.html). y = linspace(x1,x2,n) generates n points. The spacing between the points is (x2-x1)/(n-1). For engineers looking to do a job with linspace, that wins.
Of course. **Metadata is part of your data.** If you're not using that metadata, then you're making your life far more difficult for yourself and opening yourself up to many potential mistakes. 
Stick with it, that's a good course.
Thanks for the analysis. Since I did not write the code I unfortunately don't even understand it in Python 2. As far as I understand now, the code wants not 65 (for A) but 'A' (unicode might differ). So to fix this, I'd guess I have to convert the integer back to a character. (How?) Then what does `"%02X" % ord(x)` do? Or should this expression completely re-written in a Python 3 way?
`ord(x)` returns the code of the character, so it goes from 'A' to 65.

OK I might be going the wrong way with this. Looked at it a bit more and I think your interpreter is fine. This is a python 2.7 codebase. Could you share the output of 'pip freeze' in your environment? This error could be happening if you have multiple versions of django installed, which would be unusual but not entirely impossible. You can install django clean by using the two commands: pip uninstall django pip install django==1.7.3 That will at least verify you have a clean django installation on that specific version. That is assuming you really want version 1.7.3. What specifically did you do that led up to the failure? When exactly did the error get raised and kill your program?

[Compare str.split to strsplit](https://i.imgur.com/8V17Z7t.png) side by side. I prefer the one on the right. Particularly because of the English definitions of (the examples])[https://i.imgur.com/BS7ntLM.png] that can be copy and pasted to get started. &gt;## Split Character Vector on Whitespace &gt; ```str = 'The rain in Spain.';``` &gt; ```C = strsplit(str)``` &gt; C = 1×4 cell array &gt; 'The' 'rain' 'in' 'Spain.' &gt; C is a cell array containing four character vectors. vs the Python examples that can't be. A lot of people that say 'documentation is fine' forget what it's like to be new to a language or programming period. If you copy and paste something that should work and you get an error it's extremely discouraging.
Why not? I can't see anybody in their right mind paying for support for 20 odd years when they could simply upgrade with little or no compatability issues. Why pray if the code is still running?
What do you think the [bug tracker](https://bugs.python.org/) is for? Why don't you write this README?
Change `ord(x)` to `x` and it should work. Although more idiomatic Python 3 would be: import base64 decoded_val = base64.b64decode('AAMkADcAAA4fAAA=') itemID = decoded_val.hex().upper() print(itemID)
Yes. Having written technical documentation and assisted technical authors do the same thing I know how difficult it is, and that when you know your target audience precisely and you are writing in the same language they usually use. Trying to write for people ranging from complete newbies to professionals with 50+ years experience, and who have 100s if not 1000s of native languages, is anything but easy.
Gimme commit rights to and authority to this one piece, and I'll make it a top-level repo and do the README. Then take away my rights, and still be happy.
For those that don't know, everything on 3blue1brown's channel for mathematics is python-based animation. Pretty impressive.
Negative. Not at all other than excel formulas and recording some macros in Excel and then editing the output. My knowledge grew pretty organically. First I processed data, then I would save a file. How could I send that file? So I learned some email libraries, shutil, etc. How could I store that data? I learned postgresql. How could I automate my tasks in an organized fashion? I learned Airflow and Linux (I am running everything on some Ubuntu Azure servers these days). How could I provide better analysis instead of using Minitab? I learned statsmodel and scikit learn. 
Why use this instead of [Snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)? Snakeviz is more mature and has an icicle graph mode, which is essentially an upside-down flamegraph.

Because i have raised the issue in that github forum of this repo but the last response of any issue was in 2016 so i am pretty helpless. 
As above. Additionally you can use virtualenv (or any of the similar environments) to setup discreet development enviorments if you need to have different versions active at the same time on the same machine.
[Here's a script](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uourwip8qx2gone/fakeWords.py?dl=0) I threw together to test out tqdm. Running it gives me the "Type exit to kill the program." message. I can only run the script if I retype every command involving modules (including the built-in ones like "random"). Not just when the module is called by import, but any command that calls them (random.randit, string.ascii_lowercase). PyCharm definitely knows where the modules are because they show up with the path in [this window.](https://i.imgur.com/u1dIqdm.png) I've realized my PyCharm might not be set up correctly and I'm trying to find different tutorials for setting it up properly. Though it seems like a pretty straight-forward process. I'm not sure what I could have missed.

I agree it seems pretty odd. Especially considering most of the modules I'm working with are built-in. I'm running it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F10. I've also discovered that the scripts run perfectly fine in debug mode! I'm not sure why I didn't try that sooner, though I'm still pretty new to PyCharm.
yes! but realized id like a precipitation map like this http://jjhelmus.github.io/blog/2013/09/17/plotting-nsw-precipitation-data/ but still haven't figured out what package to use
Guess the number. Create a variable that gets a random number between 1 and whatever the max you want is, and then prompts the user to guess the number. After every guess, it will let the user know if they guessed high or low. As an added part, you can let them know if they've already guessed a number by keeping track of prior guesses.

Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to the number and during each iteration add "i" to an outside variable sum to store the result of addition during each iteration. 
that's just straight from the article, haven't actually gone through PYPI and looked myself. 
It sounds like [my project](https://github.com/masasin/resume) could help you. It's a resume/cover letter generator. You just add the name of the company etc and you end up with a customized cover letter that fits the resume theme. You can ask those job aggregators to send you emails (to youremailaddress+jobhunting@gmail.com) about positions that may fit, and then maybe make a filter for them in Gmail. Python can then open them and further filter them for you (Natural Language Processing might be useful), or open them in separate tabs etc. If you get good enough, you might want to automatically fill in the information needed for the cover letter.
I understand that the question asked for it to be done in a very specific fashion and that that your answer is exactly what is expected, minus the missing sum var initialization, and that the student may not be yet at comprehensions or a thorough understanding of what is a statement or an expression, but… please use comprehensions next time. Leave that imperative programming style for neutered low-level languages, or those that didn't learn from 40 years of wisdom and experience in language design.
Integers are just a way to interpret bytes of data. Very large values are problematic. As an example, back in 16 bit int systems, 65530 + 20 would give you a very low negative number due to integer overflow. 
It's not just in Python. That's what happens with floating point representation. A good way to mitigate that is to keep everything in seconds (even in the Weeks class) and convert as needed. If you really need it to be idempotent, then there are different things you can try.
I'm aware of what happens with floating point numbers, but I'm not (*edit* this isn't true) doing floating point arithmetic. The math is in integers *edit - I just remembered I'm not using the floor division operator, so even though the instance is an integer, there is floating point arithmetic done when converting from seconds. I think you may be right that it's the problem.
Not really sure what you're saying here? 
Floor would end up throwing out everything. Maybe you're looking for `divmod()`?

That's a good idea to use that so as to be able to keep track of remainders, but I'm still not sure as to how I'm going to handle problematic numbers gracefully besides what I've already done to try and make invalid states unrepresentable with the `__new__` method in the TimeUnit class.

I'm using Python 3.5 and couldn't do a circular import. Is there a trick? 
It would be great to see what this looks like without having to sign up. A couple screen shots on your Github page or program landing page would help a lot.
It depends on the language. There's a strong argument to be made that design by committee is really awful and leads to complexity (see: C++, JS, etc.) whereas having a BDFL type person leads to cleaner things (Linux? Python).
&gt; Not to mention copy/pasting code is a really bad practice in general. Yeah, I disagree with that. That's how you learn. We're all adults here and are putting together large systems. If I can do that, I can copy and paste 3 lines of code. Also, the Python docs are better than the Matlab docs. Matlab is a horrific language. All data objects are matrices including strings and including integers. All code is a deepcopy by default; this is most egregious when using classes. You can't import anything other than the top function leading to 1000 files. There are no namespaces, so all files is a directory that has to be added to the path are are imported. The Python docs are very good.
You were right, edited the post with the solution from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46270068/why-does-dividing-then-multiplying-some-large-integers-return-strange-results-in/46270231#46270231)
&gt; For engineers looking to do a job with linspace, that wins. The numpy one is better. It's more fully featured, clearly defines all the values, which have good defaults. It also has a graph. Matlab is a nasty language. You can't call a function like: def func(x, y, s=0.0, t=1.0): # do something You can't do: func(x, y, s=0.5) So instead you type: func(x, y, 's', 0.5) which is just dumb.
&gt; It's more fully featured, You're making the assumption that 'fully featured' is a benefit. Maybe python needs a '[simple wiki](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)' set of documents for new users. &gt; func(x, y, 's', 0.5) Why the would you do that? func(varargin) if nargin&lt;0 % defaults 
You are correct, I was thinking of pyvenv. 
There is a slight trick... You can't use anything from a circular import in the global namespace of the module. If you want to call something from a circular import system, you need to encase it inside a deeper scope, for example a simple `if __name__ == "__main__":` at the end of your file is enough, or inside any function. This is an example I just tested in Python 3.5.2 https://gist.github.com/dgovil/284a2d99b87d37a9b69fd58f47a9c6e9 Here's an explanation as well that does a better job than me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22650866/cyclic-import-attributeerror-module-object-has-no-attribute
Nice, the channel says it's all math visualizations. Anything out there detailing the 'how'?
I'd do Hangman then Tic Tac Toe. They are fun, you know the rules, you actually get someting to play with and show off afterwards, and you'll find lots of implementations online to read when you've finished yours. Hangman can use a list to keep track of guessed letters and the target word. You'll have to also find a way to present the word with only the guessed letters in their position with underscores for missing letters. (Make sure to test words with two of the same character). Next try Tic Tac Toe. You can use a list of lists to organize the board. This maybe isn't the *easiest* way to store that data but it will definitely give you practice with lists and probably challenge your looping skills, as well as potentially help you realize some of the implications of mutable vs immutable data structures. Another place to use a while loop in these games is when gathering user input. You can have a loop that runs until the user's input conforms to some conditon, i.e. being a number between 1 and 9 that hasn't been chosen already, or being just a single character that hasn't been guessed already. Hope this helps!
I disagree. The developers are the worst people to write the documentation. The developers use the code in the way it was intended, so they don't get those bizarre error messages. The Python devs are actually honest about that fact. At one point, I reported a bug to the Python devs that `struct.pack` was giving an error saying that I needed to provide 3 arguments, when I provided 3 arguments. The `Struct.pack` error message was getting called.
Hypnotic! 
&gt; You're making the assumption that 'fully featured' is a benefit. I use those features on numpy linspace, but that's sort of beside the point. That's a design choice. We should be comparing straight documentation preferrably on a function that has the same number of arguments. Also, don't blame "Python" for numpy's documentation. It's not a fair comparison. We might as well compare my Python package to your Matlab package. It doesn't prove anything about what most people see. &gt; Why the would you do that? I'd do it because that's how standard Matlab does it. Also because I want to edit one of the optional arguments, but not the other. Functions should have one signature. `plot(x,y,'-o','MarkerIndices',1:5:length(y))` https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html
iirc this came up a couple of months ago and you could already pass more than that via kwargs. I believe the limit was partially from parsing the code and the fix used looks like it abuses the fact that kwargs already worked by passing the arguments via kwargs when there are more than 255. (See this diff https://bugs.python.org/file23089/issue12844_arbitrary_arguments.diff, in particular ```if (n_kwargs &gt; 255) {```)
I'd use numpy. It's much, much faster for large datasets. i = np.where(my_array &gt; 10.0) output = my_array[i].sum() 
Sounds like the OP is quite the Python newbie. You may want to give some pointers to where to find out what is numpy, why care, or generally what does it mean to all the ecosystem.
That's even more clever, but point is, you can also _use a for loop_, like `[something for something in something if something]`, and it's an expression that you can just assign to something, put in an argument list, etc. A statement you can put a breakpoint in the middle of and it's not confusing, but a statement has to be on its own and has to have side effects, and you have to go through the iterations mentally a lot more to understand.
&gt; I use those features on numpy linspace And? That's not the point I was making. &gt; It doesn't prove anything about what most people see. And regex?

&gt; why care, I already said that; it's faster. The OP can google numpy. It's 500-1000x faster. It's worth knowing.
For my job search, I wrote a little webapp where I could copy/paste title and description and it would try to "rank" the most important phrases. For what it is worth, I got a job. http://resumerake.herokuapp.com/ . However, I suggest networking and making connections. Half of the hiring is just display of enthusiasm and fitting into company culture anyway. 
Wow, this is an incredible! It looks pretty complex but it gives me a better understanding of what I'm getting myself into! haha. Thanks for this :-) 
Interesting webapp. Can you further explain what your app does? What do you mean it "ranks the most important phrases"? Sounds incredible and well done for getting a job supported by your webapp :-) 
Not all people can take that first step. Give a nudge. And if that caring for performance, use the arithmetic series sum formula. Programmer time &gt; CPU time for small problems.
He has the crispest animations of any youtuber.
import functools.reduce def sum_lesser_than(numbers, cut=10) return reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [i for i in numbers if i&lt;cut]) That must do the trick, but an explicit for maybe be more easy to follow. def sum_lesser_than_ver2(numbers, cut=10) out = 0 for i in numbers: if i &lt; cut: out += i return out 
5 / 9 / 5 Bad bot! You're not very good at haiku, are you, bot? There's more to it than counting words. 
Thanks for the examples. I looked at my code again and I have two classes that use each other. Both have classmethods so I can't put the classes inside if __name__ == "__main__": nor can I put the class variables inside that, because the class needs the attributes upon import. Upon further inspection, my problem seems to be circular references, not circular imports.
fantastic, thanks!
The order of precedence for comparisons between dissimilar data types, (e.g. tuples and dictionaries, lists and integers, etc.) is not described anywhere. This makes writing a C extension for a new sequence type that behaves appropriately impossible, something I have personal experience with.
At that point I'd recommend refactoring code mostly because it sounds like there could be design improvements. Potentially defer your class variables till instantiation time. Ie when a class is instantiated, it checks if it's the first and then if not it instantiates itself. Otherwise you could possibly make a base class that both your modules import. That would be a better design too. But any kind of circular referencing probably requires some kind of rethink of code structure. Can some of your shared objects be pulled to another module? Im not sure of any language that would allow this kind of circular object description. Instances can be circular with some careful work but definitions themselves I'd recommend against it 
I've actually discovered that the *only* time I run into this issue is if I'm running a script written in Idle. I tried a bunch of different scripts I've downloaded from different websites and I tried a couple I wrote myself in Pythonista. They all worked with no issue.
You are or are not an authority figure on the cpython project? This idea has merit? 
Stared reading "Natural Language Processing with Python - Oreilly" and tinkering with NLTK..pretty excited.
What do you mean by "order of precedence"? All comparison operations have the same priority. It is documented explicitly at the very beginning of [the "Comparisons" section](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons ).
It's not clear what this means or what it will return; [1, 2] &lt; {'a': 1, 'b': 2} Rinse repeat ad nauseam for different data structures. They contain the same items yet for some reason the list is considered to be greater than the dictionary.
TypeError for different types in Python 3. Read the section that I've linked above. Python 2 behavior was "unusual". It is documented in the [same section](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons). 0n CPython 2: &gt; Objects of different types except numbers are ordered by their type names; 
Thanks for your help! I was blind not to see the obvious solution. It works. 
I've been using Python for 17 years. During that time I've done a substantial amount of work on the bug tracker. I don't know how it fits in with the github workflow. Neither do I know whether or not someone has all ready suggested this work, or if it were to be accepted. There is probably only one way to find out and that is try it. Failing that just ask on the main Python mailing list, they're bound to point you in the right direction.
Bad bot! Syllables, not words!
The use of f-strings in the OP's code tells me it's Python 3.6. Hence there should be no problems with integers as they're all the Python 2.x long. Unless you run out of memory :-)
Cool stuff, kinda like a demo. A Python demo contest would be pretty cool, with everyone having to do as much as they can in 100 lines with pygame or cairo or even make a gif with PIL or something.
Snakeviz shows incorrect timings for subcalls with common multiple roots. For example https://github.com/baverman/flameprof/blob/master/sample.py. `f1` is called from `f3` and `f2` and `sleep` and `range` (python2) from both `f1` have same timings but it should not, it's very confusing. Also flamegraphs are easy to share, it's a single svg file.
Also looks a lot like gemfiles and rbenv from ruby, sans the installing and compiling custom versions of ruby part.
You have somie ideas, or you just wait for ours? :)
Bot to post in /r/Python and ask&amp;collect bot ideas ? /s

Yeah just seen one of the admins has voided the invite.... And I can't edit on Reddit Mobile...
Well, thank you for links. Basically, if I understood correctly, when you are saying that you use C++ it is hidden calling for help similar to fake suicide attempt :) Have a nice day
&gt; Added two new opcodes: LOAD_METHOD and CALL_METHOD to avoid instantiation of bound method objects for method calls, which results in method calls being faster up to 20%. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov and INADA Naoki in bpo-26110.) that's good!
Agree. The amount of time we spent to migrate from 2.5 to 2.7 was enormous. Also some third party packages behave differently with 2.7 (example: wxpython) I can't imagine how much time we will need to migrate to 3.x. The biggest problem is this are NON-PRODUCTIVE hours. For the end user there is no added benefit.
Edited now
Would Pandas be good for analyzing 'dirty' csv files that still need to be cleaned? Should I use the csv lib first and clean and organize everything first? Or is pandas good for cleaning files?
Can someone explain how mp4s are so much smaller than the gif? Thanks!
You can't post a gif like that and not post the code used to generate it!
That sounded like a fun challenge and I was bored today so [here](https://github.com/kimpeek/Scrabble) is my version of this. I found a word list on Github, but I'm not really sure of the quality of it.
MP4's are much more efficient because they only store information of the pixels that are moving from frame to frame. Gifs on the other hand, store information from every pixel in every frame, even if that pixel is repeated across all frames.
but i want much about it
20% faster method calls are nice as well.
Just set LANG?
I don't know what to tell you - if the official documentation that I have linked doesn't help, and you have an issue you can't resolve, maybe you could drop an email to the authors and ask your question.
OK, thanks.
Can we get this title to the front page ?
no,no ,i want to know more about it, the tutorials in your links are very very short so that's why.
/r/learnpython has a lot of great resources. Pycharm has a lot of useful features.

Is matplotlib animation the best way to do this kind of thing? It seems like it couldn't be very optimized for this, since the main use is static graphs.
I use pandas to clean every dirty CSV. I don't use CSV lib for very much at all. I run into insane formats often from clients but there is almost always a way to do it in pandas once you are familiar
Maybe `self.foo = self.foo if self.foo else self.bar.get_foo()` ? The "or" method seems more readable to me though.
Here is the code link, forgive-me I do not know how to use Github : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Qvci1hzIcjNGUyVUJEWUYxSlk/view?usp=sharing It's not for the same animation (I've overwritten the old one), but It's close - only the first fase is a bit different, and the backgroung color. P.s.: Python 2.7, and you must install imagemagick first (see remarks on the code).
I really do not know - I did for fun and it worked. I use python most for data analysis, but I am not a really savvy programmer. Rgds. 
I started learning python [here](https://www.codecademy.com/), good exercises for beginners, recommend
You have to be careful with writing initializing code like this because it can easily have unintended behavior. `None` evaluates to `False` in these comparisons, but so does `0`, and empty list, and empty dictionary... these are all common initial values, and if the user passes them in for `foo`, the line `self.foo = foo or self.bar.get_foo()` will go ahead and call `self.bar.get_foo`. Maybe this is OK, depending on what type of object `foo` is. But because I like to stick to one readable pattern, I like to explicitly check for `None`. That is: `self.foo = self.bar.get_foo() if foo is None else foo`. What I've been doing recently in my own code, though, is using a factory as the default, when appropriate. For instance, a common warning is that mutable default arguments are tricky in Python. You shouldn't write def foo(bar=[]): ... Instead, people write: def foo(bar=None): if bar is None: bar = bar() What I've been doing is slightly different: def foo(bar=list): if callable(bar): bar = bar() This has the advantage of being self-documenting.
Not entirely correct, GIFs very much do not save pixels that are exactly the same as in the previous frame. Otherwise a GIF would be as big as an uncompressed video file which is certainly not the case. MP4 uses lossy compression which is going to cause most reduction of the file size.

Not sure if automating the maintenance of your relationship falls under the category of a good idea...
Truly, it is pretty bad in other languages. The thing I find a bit of a nuisance with pip is its lack of server type features. What I mean by that is, I develop two libraries and need to test a new version of A with the new version of B. I can `pip install -e .` but tox ignores that, so I end up running a devpi server. Is that an issue with tox, pip, or my setup? I don't know, but I wish I didn't have to install and configure a devpi server to get that workflow locally.
Hey, isn't this against the TOS
I don't think there are other tutorials - sorry.
The best thing to do I think would be to email the the Authors with specific questions - be clear about what questions you have. 
This is a link to a Twitter post with a link. We can do better. https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/2409
One of my friends is working on a Go bot: https://github.com/ejmejm/EJGo
thank you 
good, Can you share your code please?
Python is stubborn. If you want to convert a user input (as a string) to an integer, you have to use ``int(input("Input here"))``. Same goes for string ``( str(input("")) )``
Already did - I posted this morning. Anyway : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Qvci1hzIcjNGUyVUJEWUYxSlk/view?usp=sharing Thanks.
[Try Github](https://try.github.io) is the simplest way to learn git, also you can search more in [atlassian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) Also, nice work there. Edit: typo and broken link
Thanks, I will look and try to learn ( I am an old dog).
1. Post questions like this in /r/learnpython. 2. `input` returns a string, you need to convert it to a number with `int()`.
first, is this python ?
That's genius! Not for me directly but to help the people i work with. The designers here have to make flyers to send out but frequently make pricing or spelling errors. i made a script checks them before upload. it searches for spelling mistakes and checks pricing against a database and also converts into foreign currency as we sell worldwide and pricing needs to be consistant. if any errors are present it'll flag it up and tell them to correct them. this saves me multiple re-uploads each day.. there's others but this is the one i'm most proud of :P
That seemed like a good read, but then 10 seconds after the page loaded, a popup consumed one third of my screen. Then another popup consumed a second third. Screw this, I can't be bothered reading the rest on a website like [this](https://imgur.com/a/W3KT4). OP if you're the author, take note and please fix this.
^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) https://i.imgur.com/vGS2hjO.png ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=delet%20this&amp;message=delet%20this%20dn62fm3) 
I'm the author, and I honestly thought that I had disabled that popup a long, long time ago. Thanks for mentioning it -- I'm removing it now.
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15678153. Make sure the version of Python you're running the script with matches the version ROOT was compiled to support. The ``sys.path.append()`` line (and any ``ln`` trickery) is essentially saying "hey, OS X and Python, I know better than you what Python modules work with this Python."
Have you tried to change the "fontsize" in the suptitle ? Maybe a small font size would work. Like : plt.suptitle('Sampling the prior (N = %i)' %N, y = 1.03, fontsize = 7)
It's usually super difficult to hit the close button in those popups so I just press back and never visit the site again.
Yes. About your comment: very helpful, thanks.
thank you
A more general, 'controlling' option would be ideal, but this solves my problem at least, thanks! :)
Wow, yours is certainly more advanced than mine. My version is currently on a private repository at bitbucket. I like the use of the database. Mine has the words loaded into a list, which I've found to be incredibly slow. I was planning on rewriting it to utilize a dictionary, but I might redo it now to utilize a sqlite database like you did. Thanks for sharing it!
Automating a breakup.
I hope you enjoy !!!!
You're welcome.
and please can you share your codes everyday you program ?
&gt; How do i fix this error? &gt; ... &gt; name= input('Please enter the customers name') Add an apostrophe and use double-quotes. ;&gt;
I might, but I do not use much Python on my day by day, and most of it are some boring and simple code. But if I do something really good I would post here. 
Ingenious but maybe if you feel like you're 'wasting your time' being interested in things which interest her you may not be in the right relationship? 😂
it's ok , Share me your any kind of programming's code. and i will also Share my codes.
You could also try ```python fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, Nm, figsize=(16, 9)) ``` Increasing the tuple value pair to `figsize` might solve this.
it actually does that too — if you have pyenv installed :)
Good bot
You are the 8991^st person to call /u/GoodBot_BadBot a good bot! ^^^^/u/Good_GoodBot_BadBot ^^^^stopped ^^^^working. ^^^^Now ^^^^I'm ^^^^being ^^^^helpful.
Nice, until your script likes something when she knows you do not have access to instagram. Then she will think all the likes were automated and she means nothing to you. Maybe you should talk to her instead. Automating human behavior can be pretty tricky sometimes. Edit: her-&gt;you
Instagram has a post notifications feature. You can subscribe to her specifically and get a push when she posts. I'd do this instead and save automation for other things. 
/r/learnpython might be helpful.
Don't take it too serious 😂 We are people and we are different, she doesn't like coding in python, but that's not cause to break up, right? It just a funny way to optimize some routine task and practice in python, nothing more :)
I suppose this is useful with the recent rise in popularity of VSCode. But I would've preferred some proof reading. Perhaps the author is a non-native English speaker (I mean that with all due respect). As well, if it is truly aimed at *beginners* I like to see hyperlinks to external sources (wikipedia/python docs/etc) explaining technical terms like "interpreter" and "PYTHONPATH"
/r/relationship_advice /r/TwoXChromosomes 
&gt; i made a script checks them before upload. it searches for spelling mistakes That strikes me as... [superfluous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker) Why not automate the generation of the flyer. i.e. go *upstream*. Using a templating engine, it should be trivial to achieve. You could even have a long-text section if it's something that has a unique paragraph every time. They just submit a text file with xml/json tagged items and it populates the flyer. 
&gt; Students in my Python classes occasionally get the following error message: &gt; TypeError: object() takes no parameters How about teaching them how to use a search engine?
A hwhaaat?
&gt; The "or" method seems more readable to me though. Unfortunately it doesn't always give the same results as [u/hbweb500](https://www.reddit.com/user/hbweb500) has all ready pointed out. I've nothing to add to their excellent answer :-)
PyGame is still being updated.
Bad bot
A bot that is ok sometimes 
Nice project but just out of curiosity: Why Python 2.7?
Forgive my ignorance, but are we training the bots with those good bot/bad bot comments? Or is it just one of those internet things?
You raise a great question, which I was wondering myself just earlier. The GoodBot_BadBot bot mentions in its signature (e.g., [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/70nxze/python_made_animation/dn50vjg/)) that you can visit some Heroku-hosted webpage (i.e., [this one](https://goodbot-badbot.herokuapp.com/)) to find current results. There's a form you can use to look up individual voters – haiku_bot does not appear in my voting history, so it would seem that we are **not** training the bot with comments like these. IMHO this is a bug and I have messaged GoodBot_BadBot to make sure they're aware of the problem.
Thanks a lot, that way I can keep the legend font size on its default! :)
I'm don't like pushes because they usually disturb me from really important things
Just because most of my codes are done in 2.7 (force of habit), just a few I do in 3.6 - but It will change by the time.
OK, you should probably move the for loop into the while open(...) so you aren't reopening the file for every domain. Also, pretty sure that the socket.gethostbyname call is the one that would be raising the error, so if you want to catch that error, then the call to that function needs to be inside the try-except statement. 
Not bad :) * Split your editor and your terminal 50-50 on the screen so that you don't have to minimize and maximize the whole time. * Increase your font size rather than zooming in on the text. (there is a lot of wasted whitespace on the scree, which can be utilized) * Have a look at how MPJ uses his space on his screen on his channel, funfunfunction. It's not python code, but I think he has an excellent way in which he presents his code and examples. https://youtu.be/0X1Ns2NRfks?t=7m41s * It may be worth having a quick scan through https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. This is to give a bit of an overview of what is considered "standard" in python when it comes to how you name your variable etc. Don't want to be picking up bad habits. Keep it up. These things take time to perfect and to find your style. Good job nonetheless. 
What's the matter? Why everyone so curious about bashing op ? First of all she shouldn't have told him to be active on those sites. It's his personal choice. Still he tried to bypass it politely. Fellas, you need to revise your "relationship bibles"
Better spin this into something being "sweet" soon. If you play your cards right you might get the "Ah, how cute, he wrote a script that makes me happy" -- good luck.
Watering my plants. It required a bit of hardware, but python is monitoring the moisture and starts a pump if the moisture is too low. Then sends me an iMessage if the water reservoir is low
Why do you think regex is the solution? Regex is generally used for _matching_ strings, not _producing_ them.
Pretty "boring" favorite
Have you told her you have automated this in a way that shows her that you are still not checking her Instagram? Just doesn't seem like a very good idea if you haven't...
* I pre-bought a bunch of xbox, sony, or steam gift cards and preloaded the codes into a database with some of my team member's birthdays and emails loaded in. On their birthday, it would send. They loved it. * I wrote a script that I called "poor man's dark sky" that downloaded the doppler image for my area and scanned the particular area that my house was located and warned me roughly 60 or 30 minutes out if color was heading my way. * I have a really powerful yet simple dehumidifier that I programmed to run if humidity goes above 59% and stop when it hits 45% in my basement. Cut the use down by nearly 66%.
 def __getattr__(self, name): v = getattr(self, 'get_' + name)() setattr(self, name, v) return v
Agreed. I'm all for *automating the boring stuff,* but when it comes to paying attention to your partner, you should probably be doing that yourself. An easy middle ground in OP's case would be to just turn on post notifications for his GF and then manually like the photos. OP wouldn't have to waste the time sitting around for new photos and he could let IG tell him when there is something new to view. Then since he is still manually clicking the like button, it's harder to make mistakes by letting his script like something he shouldn't have or in case she asks him a question he would have known if he actually saw the photo posted. Heart is [kinda] in the right place, but the head isn't. 
Awesome!
Can you be more specific? What's a CTF? What is your specific task? Are you parsing strings or generating strings?
cause everyone is a role model on how to run a relationship it seems.... lol. i automated some wife tasks too, guess i need to start working on my divorce.
JupyterLab might be a good option for this
&gt; Not sure if automating the maintenance of your relationship falls under the category of a good idea... Gotta agree with this sentiment. It falls under the category of **best** idea.
Thanks i will use these tips thank you so much and have a nice day 
This is genius! What hardware did you use? 
Codecademy for learning the basics Tutorialspoint for specific keywords and function E.g. how to use print() Or just try Google for things not on those sites Or ask me or someone else on the subreddit.
Sounds cool. Can you give any high-level tips on any of the following? 1) How to send an iMessage with Python? 2) What sensors/libraries you're using? 3) What hardware are you using to pump the water?
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that she's not that important, then
I started with "Automate the Boring Stuff", it is a great book that is available free online. 
It's a reverse engineering (Capture the Flag). Pretty much I need to spam this program they have with strings until it tells me I'm right. I'm just having problems making it go through AZ,az,09, and symbols. I tried += and ended up with 0, 01, 011, 0111 etc. lol 
Sorry, I wasn't good at programming even when I was doing it a lot. I'm just someone struggling through life. =)
OP's "girlfriend" could be a bot in which case that's legit automation.
I have suggested it to them before.. Same with email flyer automation (they seem to be liking this idea the last time i mentioned it though) they're quite adament that they want to have full control over how it looks and not to have it looking like a grid or templatey. It might be a job for the future though..
Because that's not his job, that's the designers job. And I suspect they aren't going to be impressed with that plan. 
ok, well, regex is used for string matching/parsing, and your task is generating permutations so that's not what you need. it sounds like you're just asking for helping on developing the algorithm, which I'm not willing to do. it's a learning exercise right? you gotta learn somehow. if you are looking for some google-able search keyworks though try looking for "string permutation algorithm".
I mean, it's not fully automated, but I schedule wake-up messages and stuff when I know she's up earlier than I am, but I still want to surprise her. Does this make me a bad person? Where is the line. 
If it were me, I would randomize the time a little. Like set it to check every 2 minutes, but only execute a “like” on the photo of a randomly generated number 1-10 is equal 4, so every two minutes there’s a 10% chance it will like it. Yes there’s a slim chance it could go hours without liking it, but eventually it will, and it won’t seem like he always likes it immediately after the post was posted.
Here's something I just automated, I need to generate an SSL client/server certificate pair for a Java application I use and support (Java is a pain in general but especially so with SSL). Because of how my application stack works, I receive the certs in a text format which requires some processing which I then pass to the openssl utility to output as an SSL keystore which my app needs. I did that manually a few times and got so pissed off that I wrote a small Python script to do the work. Took me about an hour to write the script and it really improved my workflow. The next step would be to automate the calling of my script but I'm holding off on that for now. If I end up needing to run it repeatedly (it's been ad hoc up till now), I will add that piece next.
Thank you.
&gt;And I suspect they aren't going to be impressed with that plan. Ok.
You appear to be unfamiliar with the concept of "schools" and "universities". These are institutions where people go to teach other people knowledge and skills *directly*, usually with all participants physically present. The learning process is not restricted to bootstrapping the recipients with instructions for a search engine so they may painstakingly collect the fundamentals from random websites of varying quality, but instead tries to actually cover the relevant content. Part of the learners-teachers dynamic is that the learners are allowed to ask questions and receive an immediate answer that is actually informative, which is in stark contrast to the Internet's default response of "fucking google it noob".
I have a script which moves emils on a certain date from a folder to the inbox. It's because apple mail can only run rules on inbox so I had to write a script to automate my workflow.
I mean, that's the reality of the workplace. If you go wandering around the office telling everyone you're going to automate their job you aren't going to get much buy-in. Especially because you probably don't know fuck all about what they actually do anyway. 
I don't think this is what OP had thought this thread would turn into
Correct, but I didn't want an answer. Just looking for a start point or something to be able to look up. I just didn't know how to move forward. So far up to this point everything was made through google searches. I just didn't know what this was called. I can do some reading. Thank you for the term.
if you'd like to avoid using zerynth I recommend [loboris](https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo)'s micropython firmware build, which actually uses both cores of your esp32. you'll need to use [espressif's sdk](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html) to flash it
Like the video, very good! Suggestion: - You talk too much "guys" and "ok guys" try to avoid those repetitive words.
Kivy is another option for you (and it lets you deploy on iOS, Android too) There's a fun 2016 pycon tutorial video (google it) that will walk you through building a flappy bird clone. Earlier versions of Kivy used pygame as a back end. Later versions use SDL2. 
If the message is that bad then the OP can raise the patch to improve it. Until such time as that happens, and I won't be holding my breath, your favourite search engine would appear to be a good option. I don't recall saying anything about "fucking google it noob" as bing, yahoo, duckduckgo and others are options. As for "schools" and "universities" I know a little about them, having got to be a Member of The British Computer Society and a Chartered Engineer until long term ill health ended my career.
https://python.swaroopch.com/ outstanding, read the reviews
Have you looked at pycharm? I'm not sure what you are describing, but Pycharm lets you debug your code and you can inspect variables and objects in real-time. And it auto-saves locally.
Fair comment so how about [Combinations and Permutations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html). Then go to the [itertools module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html). This is one of the modules that every Python programmer needs to know about :-)
I would be interested in hearing more about poor man's sky. 
&gt; What I don't like about Spyder is that it doesn't have autosave. I sometimes forget to save and my computer battery runs out and powers off, and I lose my code. (*Spyder maintainer here*) We're very sorry for that. We're working to provide this functionality in Spyder 4, to be released next year.
I doubt it is anything serious but if you can make her happy by automating something, why not? My wife doesn't do the while social media thing, but if I liked her pictures, it would make her happy, which is reciprocal. 
1. I hope that you are using Python 3, if not you should be using `raw_input`. 2. You need to convert the string returned from `(raw_)input` into an int. 3. You can write `if age &gt; 16 and age &lt; 105:` as `if 16 &lt; age &lt; 105:`. 4. I'd fix the cut and paste error while I was at it :-)

I read some webnovels on my phone, so I wrote a little scraper that allows me to browse them from a terminal. This does 2 things: 1. Saves battery: the pages I browse run heavy javascript in the background, presumably for their ads. Whatever it is, my phone heats up enough that touching it is moderately uncomfortable when reading for over 15 minutes. My terminal isn't really using any cpu cycles when I'm scrolling through a chapter. 2. Saves battery: my phone uses OLED pixels (AKA no backlight, pixel color is what consumes screen power), so the black background of my terminal means most of them don't need to be on. In comparison, the webpages are mostly white. Before I could read for about 3-4 hours continuously without recharging. Now I can pretty much do it all day (12-ish hours?).
Use the `tobytes` method to create a binary representation. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using.

Ok thanks i will use these tips i hope you have a nice day 
This is the second time today that I see someone on the Internet quoting their impressive expertise which coincidentally covers the exact subject at hand, while simultaneously making radically uninformed remarks about that same subject.
Automated subtitle downloading, the source code is viewable at: https://github.com/RafayGhafoor/Subscene-Subtitle-Grabber
(Directions are US only) It's pretty simple: * It uses requests to download my "local" radar image from https://radar.weather.gov/index_lite.htm. Just click on the radar closest to you * At this point, I do a little hardcoded math to figure out which pixels are where I am located on the state map, where about 50 miles out is, and where about 25 miles out is. These are my "Weather is nearing" and "Weather is here!" alert distances. Finally aside from the 50/25mi longitudinal line, I set about a 10mi north/south coordinate to create a sort of box that I check for doppler colors. Your mileage may vary. * If you wanted to be fancier than I, you could factor in wind speed values from something like Weather Underground to factor the actual rate at which the storm is moving. * After this, I use Pillow to analyze if colors cross into the 50 and 25 mi borders in the image. If they do, I send out the appropriate message using my notifier. I currently use Home Assistant as it will not only pop up on my phone, but also on my TV. I have used gmail and twilio in the past. It isn't foolproof (hence the poor man's moniker) but if I am downstairs working on something (sound insulated) it has notified me that I need to head upstairs and close my windows a few times. EDIT: I have since learned (now and before) that there are similar weather services offered by Wunderground and Darksky(https://darksky.net/dev/docs) for free. At the time, I did not know or care to know. It was an opportunity to use freely available data to learn Pillow and have fun with Python. It's the same reason I just didn't put calendar reminders in for the birthday gifts or exclusively use Home Assistant automations to control my dehumidifier.

OP here. You mean this bug report, based on my blog post? https://bugs.python.org/issue31506 I would have submitted something, but one of the core developers did so before I had a chance. Also, I train experienced developers at Fortune 100 companies, and not in a school or university -- but I do value my students' questions, and when the questions repeat themselves many times and at many companies, I figure it's worth pointing out.
God damn! Thats what I was missing! /s

Hi, i am a bot who in name of konradkar automatically replies to this recurring topic what does konradkar automates. He automates this. 
Next thing you know he'll be using a chat bot to handle the small talk with her. 
Not much of an automation, but I wrote a script for Selenium to index my saved posts and urls in Reddit along with their corresponding subs, title, short description, posted date, OP profile etc, and store them in a nice json file. I can query it when needed, I can see posts grouped by subs, by users, by months, etc. It is cool when you quickly need to find some url you saved for later use. Edit: [GitHub source](https://github.com/desmonduz/RedditSavedScraper)
TCP.sendSpecificAmountOfBytes(AmountOfBytes) ...what do you want to do? https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html This should get you started
isnt there a ifttt to do this?
Couldn't you create a variable that stores how many times the script has run, and if it exceeds, say, 5 times, like the post? 
Until she asks you about one of the pictures and you've never seen them. 
Yeah, that would work too. loop that adds 1 to a variable each time it executes and if it hits 5, like the photo regardless of the random number... I believe it would be something like (I don't know python, just C#, so excuse my use of pseudo code here) if x&lt;5 (while x &lt; 5, generate a random number y, if y = 4 "like" the photo and set x to 0, else x+=1) else like the photo. 
Just my two cents on keeping your relationship in tact, but you might want to have the script run a little less frequently, and maybe at slightly randomized intervals so she doesn't get suspicious or notice a trend. You also might want to have the script send you the photo in case she asks you about it later that day or whatever. Edit to actually answer your question: It's not Python, but I have used the Google apps script to make a few things easier for me. I get a nearly daily email about cheap airfare /mistake pricing, but the aggregator typically includes over a dozen starting airports, so I wrote a GAS program to filter through those and only send me a small list of deals from one of the airports near me (there are 3 in a 1 hour radius that I would actually consider and often get deals). The second, which I'm actually still working on, is to automate tracking dues for a club I run. We primarily use Venmo for expenses, so the script scrapes emails from Venmo, identifies the person's name and transaction amount, and adds this to a ledger. I am still working on the subtleties of matching this to the registration list (a Google form/sheet), since people sometimes use different names on Venmo and the registration but it's getting there. 
I use mine to populate my google music playlists with songs that they play over my favorite radio stations. Why I do this is for a couple of reasons. The main reason was because I was directly streaming music from Google Play to my car via bluetooth via my phone network; A 15min drive (one-way) caused my data usage to go over my allotted 4gb limit in 20days. Now with my script in place, I don't consume any data whatsoever since my playlist music gets auto-downloaded to my phone every morning and then I just bluetooth that to my car's audio system. If anyone is interested, I'll make the code available.
I've no idea what that is meant to mean and neither do I care.
This is incredible. Good bot. 
Because her happiness is probably derived from you liking her pictures. A bot that's logged in to your account liking her pictures is a different thing. If she really does just want the upvotes on her pictures then go for it with the automation, but she probably wants you the person to look at the pictures and react to them
I have no idea what you're asking. You're using 'regex' in many places that don't make sense to me. Could you try rephrasing the question without using that term? It might help my brain wrap around the question. I do know what regexes are. It's just a lot of the same word used to describe multiple things.
Can you share your code, please? I would love to use it
explain? 
So you've finally got around to pointing it out after how many years and how many occurrences? Whoopie do.
I ended up hard coding the location to the ID and removing the if statement altogether. Up and running, thanks for replies.
She sounds pretty insecure dude...
Sounds good, I guess I'll write something like that, thanks!
Not only are you automating paying attention to your girlfriend, but you are also [doing it wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss).
This is great. My son has asthma. So every time he takes his inhaler or breathing treatment he pushes a button that's connected to my Raspberry Pi. The Pi records it and trains a predictive model (using weather, allergy, and air quality data) to predict when he'll need his inhaler. Then it emails the school nurse, and me, notifying her that there is a high likelihood that he'll need some preemptive treatment today. **EDIT**: Wow, didn't think this many people would be interested in this project! Yes I will definitely post to this subreddit once I open source it (still a lot of work to be done). Currently I'm using a simple GLM that reaches a decent level of accuracy. I'd like to take into account other events that trigger his asthma like 1) did he play with animals 2) how long did he spend outside 3) how much energy he exerted (maybe get him a smart wearable for this? this one is a stretch I think) 3a) maybe heart rate? (a smart watch should be able to capture this right?) Cleaning the data up is a bit tricky, but I think once I get some of this other data then the model will perform better. Also I'd like to connect the button (somehow) to the inhaler so that every time he uses it, it records it automatically so that he doesn't have to also push the button on the Pi. I've taken a break on this project for a while but now I'm feeling it again! I'll end up adding everything here: https://github.com/tmthyjames/AllergyAlert

Ask a member of the British Computer Society, I'm confident you'll find someone there who's able to break it down for you. \^\^
You've been really helpful. I was aware of the distinction between floating point and decimal but didn't realize that the "Numeric" type in SQLite was floating point. I probably should have done more reading before trying to play with SQLite! Prior to this conversation I also wasn't aware that SQLite data types were so different from SQL Server. Thank you tons for the help!
Wow, that's one of the best optimization that I've met
yeah, it needs a paper trail, email your inbox, give you some chat up lines.
That's really impressive! Well done.
I'm no longer in touch with the British Computer Society, and don't intend chasing down a member because of a well known bozo who features prominently on reddit spouting crap.

easy, just extend it to send him the photos it likes after a hour in a doc
Ok , here is the example of a sectiom of unformmated html source of a signup form &lt;form action="/action_page.php"&gt; &lt;div class="container"&gt; &lt;label&gt;&lt;b&gt;Email&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Enter Email" name="email" required&gt; If i want to programn the machine to identify if a site is a form or not what would i make the machine search for? To discover that i want to compare x numbers of signup form html sources and check what define them as forms? Is it the labels? Or the placeholders? Or the form tags? Or ids? Divs? That is what i mean
( sorry for the multiple comments)
I'm currently making a few changes to it right now. I have the older version available but that stopped working since some of the radio stations changed their playlists to dynamically load in chunks using a javascript button. Now I use some magic in determining the nextPageToken for the next chunk (list of songs played previously) and do that in an async function (for some stations) so that I can retrieve the song content from the playlists in a short time. I'll have it ready in a couple of days. 
As soon as you be ready, maybe someone will be able to contribute to it and help you
I wish to learn, this is why im asking for help. please teach me ;-;
ive never seen this bot before 
Or maybe modify the script so it send him a text or notification every time she posts something. 
Do you know what a string is? An integer?
not quite but i think i keep creating them on accident because i get "string errors" 
Thanks! That's what happens when you're bored and love programming ;)
Figure that out, then. Are you learning by yourself or is it a school course?
Wow, this is incredible! What type of model did you use to make your predictions?
school, was hospitalized due to attempted suicide... so im kinda behind 
That's a good idea, you could have it all organized in a feed so he could just scroll through them. 
Then start by learning what strings and integers are.
ok 
Bot "automation" if you know what I mean.
Not just loosy but way more efficient compression. Details in the linked FAQ.

That is great, I seriously love this application.
He mentioned automating *spellcheck* ffs. If it's coming down the pipe, and it smells awful, I'm liable to go to the source and clean it up myself. EDIT: To add further anecdote: I'd do it anyway, and present it to them first. If they don't like it, but it's clearly valuable, I'll take it up. And yeah, I expect the sentiment on this sub to be "don't go automating people out of jobs" but me personally, I'll do it. If I don't then someone else will. &gt; Especially because you probably don't know fuck all about what they actually do anyway. If they can get away with spelling mistakes, then I doubt what they do is really that complicated. Again, not a great generalization, but in this specific case, I'll pass judgement.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers There are a few libraries for Python https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/python https://github.com/appnexus/pyrobuf The first is faster than Pickle while the second is faster than the google version but it has a few rough edges.
**Protocol Buffers** Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data. Google developed Protocol Buffers for use internally and has provided a code generator for multiple languages under an open source license (see below). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

Recent advances in microcomputers and commoditization of simple wireless technologies have made it easier than ever to automate physical things with Python. It's pretty amazing!
I feel like there's probably a spot somewhere in between "I never look away from your Instagram" and "I can't be bothered to look at your Instagram a couple times per week"
Books are a great place, to start. It's nice to be of the computer. 
Try https://pypi.python.org/pypi/getch Keep in mind though that Windows and *nix will return different codes for special keys like arrows, home, end, F-keys, etc. that will require multiple getch's for one keypress.
I don't know that I agree with OP's actions, but someone on a similar thread automated something on their phone to send a text to his wife when he leaves work that just says, "On my way home." And that his wife was very appreciative of having a better sense of when he might be home so that she could plan dinner.
automate the boring stuff with python. there is a site, a udemy class and a book
 import breakup try: bu = breakup.start(transport="sms") except YOUJERKException: pass finally: breakup.forget_about_her(force=True)
to answer your first question, you can send messages with python using Twilio, sign up and they'll give you a free trial. 
Oh, I had assumed he meant an actual iMessage not an SMS.
See, here's where you're going to fail. You think that fixing some spelling is equivalent to doing the design. 
Also do not forget to `import psnobugsplease`
Yeah, it would be great to add autosave. I like basically everything else about Spyder. ;)
TIL Python coders are good at giving relationship advice

Any chance you could share the code on this? Sounds great! 
I'm not sure how getting the key pressed would help me here, can you elaborate?
Oh my fault didn't make the realization that SMS and iMessage were different, I just generalized SMS right away 
Wow that sounds amazing is the code available on any public GitHub repo? I'm sure other people could benefit from this project
Yep. That would be ideal. I'll fix it up asap. 
What was the project? can u tell me some details? is it useful for me, I mean can I make something similar for my finishing project?
I wish getting over ex-girlfriends was easy as a line of code...
Usually the line is where it shows you aren't interested in her life. A good rule of thumb is that if you're unwilling to tell her about the automation, you're probably being a dick. 
It would work better if you changed the interval to be a Poisson random number, as it would more naturally mimic a natural person's actions.
Thanks for your advice, I guess I will update my script a bit
&gt; "don't go automating people out of jobs" It's not even about that though. If someone's doing a shitty enough job that you can make a script that does it better, they don't deserve to have a job, and in general, automation is the future. You're assuming that the workplace is fair, smart and the business is looking for greatest advantage. You've completely and utterly failed to factor in the human factor in all of this. I've already said that I couldn't care less if they lost their jobs. However, just because a project has inherent merit doesn't mean that you'll be able to implement it. Since in this scenario the assumption is that he doesn't know the details of their job specifically, he would need to garner support in order to affect change. In most scenarios, he would require support of the designers themselves, and while we're at it, come the fuck on, implementing an autospellcheck isn't "automating people out of jobs". For fucks sake. That's just absurd. The business always wants to be as effective as possible, but it doesn't matter what you know, it matters what you can show, and how ham-handed your superiors, or co-workers are. If they're making spelling mistakes, of all the fucking things, I doubt either side is too cooperative. 
Care to share some technical details? Is it something like reinforcment learning or nore simple? Just curious. 
In the interest of making the bot slightly less "I like your stuff with a bot"-like. These are just suggestions, though, take them however you want: * make it so that it operates at times that you're normally at a computer. If you're like me, and you're at a computer from 9am - 5pm and then from 10pm - 1am, set it to run during those periods. * don't make it vote on everything. Eventually she'll think that's weird. If I were to do this myself, I'd start by liking something like 10% of the posts, and slowly ramp up to something like 1 in 3 posts. * This is the important one, I think: you should set it to send you a notification / email of the pictures that it likes, so that if they come up in discussion, you can discuss them. Also: spending time to make her feel better like this is an indication that you care. You don't care in the same way that some of the other people do, but not everyone cares the same way. You keep doing you.
A bot that responds to reddit posts asking for bot ideas. 
We are really not here to do your work for you. But i can think of a few workable automated aproaches. For example: run a spider over the 1000 - 10000 most popular sites, parse out all visible text, create a dictionary of number of occurences of words, normalize, run a clustering algorithm over these (dbscan should work nicely), manually categorize your clusters -&gt; you have now a usable model to identify pages 
depends on what you mean by getting over Certainly technology enables us to actually perform the breakup. I'd love to see a lib that does this lol
Thank you for your comment, I think these are good ideas and I'll update my script
Can you expand on this? My typical email workflow is to move things out of the inbox to other folders for archiving, but not the other way around... just curious how things got into the other folders in the first place and why you want them back in the inbox? 
Hope you're okay bro
1. You should ask questions over at /r/learnpython, not here. 2. You shouldn't be writing new code in python 2; it's only for people who need to run old code. You should upgrade. 3. `raw_input` doesn't reposition the cursor like you say it does. I think the following code has the behaviour you want: command = raw_input('ciscoasa# ') if command == 'configure terminal': config_command = raw_input('ciscoasa(config)# ') If your code does something different then you should show it to us.
I use mailtags to set a date until I want to postpone working on a mail. I can move tagged mail out of mailbox to a waiting room, but then I need a script to bring it back to inbox. After 20+ of work, this is the best and only system that I found to work with email and help me remember things. Couldn't work without it really.
Wrote a script yesterday to start/stop a dockerized Tor proxy and switch my network settings accordingly (Not nearly as cool as watering the plants or as brave/potentially catastrophic as automating my interactions with the missus, I know)
Spelling errors happen. They slip through. Jesus, man. You must think you are some kind of special to complete dismiss what a designer does without known jack about the situation other than your assumptions. You might want to knock that ego down a notch or two. Just a suggestion. 
You're taking text input without moving the cursor. Key pressed == character input for all the alphanumeric keys (plus space) at least.
Use this one all the time, love it. It's weird that its imported it at the bottom though of the code though. 
hahahahahahaha that's great
a game in which you basically crack passwords. You insert a random password and then it tells you how many chars are in the right place. Kinda like hacking in the fallout series.

She straight up told him she would like if he looks at her instagram posts. wouldn't you want to make your gf happy?
I mean, it's a wake up message. That hardly says that I'm not interested in her life. It is usually a thought I have the night before, and so set one for the morning. She knows it's scheduled most of the time.
You have a typo: `print=`.
oh thank you... i owe you some reddit gold in the future 
From limited experience I would choose Kivy over PyGame, especially if you're on a Mac/cross platform is important. &gt; I also struggle to understand OOP PyGame uses OOP too, as does Kivy. Maybe my years as an 'enterprise programmer' have ruined my perspective but I have a hard time imagining writing a game without classes/objects.
Your gf shouldn't be forcing you to use social media if it doesnt interest you. Paying attention to someone isn't liking her selfie every week 
Hmm...
You can reverse that if you `import antigravity`. 
A lot of Google Analytics and Adwords reporting and bid adjustments. Not only is it way faster to pull the info from the APIs, but there is more information available once you know what you want.
&gt; maybe heart rate? (a smart watch should be able to capture this right?) Yeah my Gear s3 takes automatic heart readings throughout the day.
Sure will! Check my edits.
Using a simple logistic GLM atm.
However this text was a simple automation to help her better plan and coordinate. I had similar scripts when I was in high school to let my parents know when I left the house/when I got home. Liking a post on instagram is a gesture of love, much like how having an automaded script to tell your partner you love them might not be the brightest idea.
It's decent. I plan to add more data to it (see my edits). Hoping that will bring up accuracy.
Not yet but I will open-source it very soon! Will update here when it is available.
Awesome. And is this data available for analysis? Like could I query it and do what I want with it?
From the work I've done on machine learning, it could just build a training set. A neural network takes in a vector and outputs a vector, so if you have an input vector (weather, allergy, air quality measures, etc) and outputs just one number (likelyhood that inhaler would be needed) then you can build a training set and continue updating it. So at the end of the day each day it would add to the training set the input vectors and whether or not the inhaler was needed. It might be better to use reinforcement learning but this is my best educated guess on how I would do it.
Why there "--http 8000", when you have unix socket in your uwsgi.ini file?
I wrote a few programs in Python that work together, one pulls any Imgur albums/pictures I comment the word "Save" on to a folder on my computer. Another one sorts my downloads folder. A third renames picture files to their UNIX timestamp to make sorting easier and keep everything to a simple naming convention.

I think both sides of this is weird. Is not getting enough attention on social media a thing? Is it a healthy thing? I don't think I could take anyone seriously who said something like that.
That's probably the better solution, I kind of just threw out reinforcment learning because I've worked with it in the past. Basically you'd be assigning a score to the guesses and it'd try to maximize its score, but then you'd need to come up with grading criteria and what not. That's really cool you were able to put that together. 
Ahh, I added that while testing this thing, I run into the same issue without it. I've updated my post to show the command without that parameter, thanks.
Very constructive. Should be something for Constructive use like [ETHICAL-HACKER-SCRIPTS](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)

An Arduino Mini/Pro for measuring and RF24 for wireless communication. A Raspberry Pi for receiving (with another RF24) and logic (timing and when to pump). I have a Mac Mini for iMessages, which is not located at my house, so I have setup a relay from the Raspberry to the Mac Mini, but only for messages. I found the pump on eBay for ~$1 and the same for the moist sensor.

I have a Mac Mini for iMessages, which is not located locally, so I have setup a relay from the Raspberry to the Mac Mini, but only for messages. I found the pump on eBay for ~$1 and the same for the moist sensor. I haven't really used any libraries only MQTT, because I use the RF24 for my Roomba too. The messages are relayed over a flask webserver hosted on the Mac (through an SSH tunnel for security) and the Mac uses an AppleScript I found through Google.

Next week's post: What do I do with 255 size extra-small Supreme thongs?
There should be an app for that
No that would make each prompt appear twice appear twice. I already tried it. eg, on a regular ssh shell, this would be the output ciscoasa# configure terminal ciscoasa(config)# If I were to use your code, it would do this: ciscoasa# ciscoasa# configure terminal ciscoasa(config)# ciscoasa(config)# I've pasted my full code below so you can see it, if you wish: import paramiko import time ip = '1.2.3.4' username = str("testuser") password = str("test1") enablepassword = str("test2") ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) ssh.connect(ip, username=username, password=password, look_for_keys=False, allow_agent=False) print('Successfully connected to %s' % ip) remote_conn = ssh.invoke_shell() time.sleep(.005) remote_conn.send('enable\n') time.sleep(0.1) remote_conn.send(enablepassword + '\n') time.sleep(0.1) output = remote_conn.recv(65535) print output time.sleep(0.1) z = 1 while z &gt; 0: x = raw_input() remote_conn.send(x + '\n') time.sleep(0.1) output = remote_conn.recv(65535) time.sleep(0.1) print output time.sleep(0.1) if "exit" in x: z = 0 ssh.close() The result is below when I execute commands: https://imgur.com/a/PSzlF

I have a number of automations: * A part of my job is keeping a database up to date. The database consists of college course codes, titles, and what the uni. I work for generally awards as transfer credit. These needed updates come to me in an Excel and I am expected to import them into our sql database through this super clunky frontend. So I have a script that opens the database and Excel file in a VM in my left most window and then "reads" the Excel file line by line and opens the corresponding entry in the Database and updates it. I use the VM for this so I can do other work (like writing this post) on my other screens but still look busy. * Feeds my chickens and rabbits and alerts me when their feed bin needs to be filled and when their water tank is running low (which is itself "automated" since 90% of the time I use rainwater collected from the coop). * Monitors the temperatures of my compost piles and alerts me when they need water, to be turned, and when it's probably done cooking. Very important because we compost nearly everything (including waste meat and animal remains) so we need to run very high heat compost for multiple weeks straight to kill off pathogens. * Monitors the traffic on my street and sends a weekly complaint email to my local police department alerting them to the trends of speeders (Live on a 20mph residential neighborhood and regularly get people going 40 to 50mph around the blind corner in front of my house). Cops actually appreciate my emails and I've been thanked by the guys who sit out front running speed traps because they have been able to dial in on the speeders.
Too complicated... Too many tools to install and configure 
I don't see this problem as an isolated case. I look at this problem and understand that OP has a problem with doing what it takes to make his girlfriend happy. it could be the case that this is the ONLY problem in his relationship related to his girlfriend telling him she would appreciate if he did something and him just writing it off, but I doubt that's the case.

Please format your code properly.
ok 
Also, please include your actual message in the same comment as your code. It's much easier to read that way.
I was thinking of it in terms of gradient descent, so minimizing the error. With the neural net model I built in python it would be as simple as like, training_set = [ //no inhaler needed [0.2,0.32,0.45], //Inhaler needed [0.8,0.74,0.65] ] truth_set = [ [0], [1] ] Then just pass the training set and truth set into the model, train it for a given number of iterations, then you can run any tests on the new data for the day. If you save each day to a file and read it in, then you can just have it retrain itself every week or so.
I don't think he should have automated it. He should have talked to her about it. We don't know if he never looks, or she gets mad he doesn't like every picture within 30 minutes. I'd like her pictures when I got on Instagram, but I would not start checking Instagram religiously to make sure I liked every single one in a timely manner.

Good to know! Given that this is critical, we'll try to implement it in one of our `3.2.x` Spyder releases. However, I can't promise anything because we don't know how it could be.
Your code is still not formatted correctly. You need four spaces before each line.
what do you mean 
I mean that you need to put four spaces before each line of your code if you want Reddit to display it correctly.
oh ok 
OP says frequently make spelling and pricing mistakes. That's a bad and/lazy designer. Either that or they really should have someone double checking the work. I 100% agree that this job should be automated. It doesn't have to replace the designer, who I assume has more jobs than sending out shitty fliers, but automating it is one less job for that person.
I think you can also use Darksky to get a minute-by-minute forecast to do something similar. https://darksky.net/dev/docs

it now comes out with this Please enter the customers name:john Please enter the customers age:18 Please enter ammount of violations committed:3 john as a moderate risk driver, your insurance will cost $ &lt;function price at 0x02D82E88&gt;
Your code is still not formatted correctly. Also, you're using the same names for variables and functions. This won't work. Also, you can't use functions like this - they don't "see" variables defined inside other functions.
but it was working just a second ago :( how do i fix this
i just need to know how to fix my price display 
Reconsider how you pass data between your functions. Look into arguments and the `return` statement.
Please enter the customers name:john Please enter the customers age:18 Please enter ammount of violations committed:4 john as a high risk driver, your insurance will cost 480.0 but it was working?
I have no idea what you mean by "it was working". Stop posting multiple comments stating multiple different things as a response to multiple of my comments. Collect your thoughts, _then_ comment. Your "price display" is broken because your functions still have the same names as your variables.
&gt; Guido hasn't vetoed it yet Just FTR in this day and age he often passes on authority about PEPs to "BDFL delegates" so, contrary to popular belief, it's not an out and out one man decision.
i changed it so function price is now named "get price" and the variable price is just named price, now its saying that in risk_type() price is not defined
Awesome! Did not expect this response -- amazing!!
Yes, because functions don't see variables from other functions.
so how can i put price into risk_type()?
By using arguments and return values.
example? (by the way thank you for having such enormous patience with me, I can only imagine how annoying this must be for you)
 def this_function_returns_five(): return 5 result = this_function_returns_five() print("this_function_returns_five returned", result) def this_function_takes_an_argument(argument): print("this_function_takes_an_argument got an argument", argument) this_function_takes_an_argument(1) 
thank you so much. I fixed it. im gonna go thru and upvote all your stuff for a bit 
Happened years ago as in my post above that talked about "BDFL delegates". Also note that anybody is entitled to comment on any thread on either python-ideas or python-dev. It is amazing to see the number of times that someone comes up with an idea that at first glance seems brilliant, but on one or other of those mailing lists gets shot down in flames because technically it's flawed. Failing that there's also the `why can't this be a one liner?`. My usual approach to that is simple, I want Python in a Nutshell to fit into my pocket, not the back of a 44 ton(ne) articulated lorry like Java in a Nutshell, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1.

Not sure how often the GF is posting, but she literally told him to like her photos and pay attention to her account so I feel like ramping up the like percentage (or even having a non 100% liked ratio) isn't really necessary, but I guess that's up to OP. I do like setting it to run during typical computer times, OP could even add a google calendar tie in so it only runs when he either is/isn't at work (depending on the job), or maybe during commute times if he uses public transit (usually when I use fb/ig/feed type programs). 
Messaging my friends happy birthday. Yes I know, it's really sad. 
Love that last one.
Thanks! Just looking at your edits, the smart watch heart rate thing is likely hard to do. For a lot of the fitness apps (including fitbit - who I suspect youd go to as default) it's actually really hard to pull heart rate data out. That said, the rest of the data is reasonably easy to extract from them. I've got an IFTTT tool that automatically saves my fitbit data to a Google drive spreadsheet for example! 
I would imagine that you do not have enough data points to accurately train a model. However if thousands of people started to use this, and you added features to your model that allowed you to account for individual differences between people, then maybe you could get some interesting results.
That's a great idea! Def gonna open source this ASAP.
If the data given in [PEP 538: Legacy C Locale Coercion](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0538/) isn't clear enough please ask on the main Python mailing list or even python-dev, better sorted sooner rather than later. For my benefit what is a non-C locale as my experience is mostly VAX/VMS, with a bit of Windows thrown in!!!

Every day I take the train to London for work. If it's 15+ minutes late (or cancelled) they pay compensation. Funnily enough the train companies don't publish the info on lateness, so I wrote a little bot that uses the industry open data feeds to check if any of my journeys on the previous days were eligible for a refund, and emails me if any are.

We had a friend who wrote formulaic emails to a group of friends from university about his day. They would start with what club or restaurant he went to with different people (he was a new trader at a securities brokerage), where he was playing golf next, and they would often include news stories about his home city of Winnipeg. He got very busy at his new job and sent fewer and fewer emails. At the same time, I wanted to learn Python, and I had a Nokia N900 with Python so I wrote a program to replace him on the phone. It had a small set of clubs and restaurants and different groups of people he would go with, phrases from past emails. It would scrape links from news feeds out of Winnipeg. I registered a very similar sounding Gmail address and gave it the list of contacts and let it go. It would write emails like this: "Oy vey! Was at Spring Rolls tonight with CS guys. I was telling people about how I can change CD tracks in less than 4 clicks using iDrive in the beemer. Did you guys see this headline --Chargers expect home opener to be blacked out, snapping streak of 48 sellouts (http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/football/chargers-expect-home-opener-to-be-blacked-out-snapping-streak-of-48-sellouts-103012034.html)... oh my goodness Golfing on Sat at 5am See ya ladies," We found it a familiar replacement but he didn't like it. That phone got stolen and Linux based phones seemed to die off so development stopped, although I'd love to apply machine learning techniques to it to improve the features and capabilities. I'd use it to keep in touch.
&gt; You might want to knock that ego down a notch or two. Just a suggestion. I will. &gt; You must think you are some kind of special to complete dismiss what a designer does without known jack about the situation other than your assumptions. I think you are conflating "automating the reporting process" with "doing the designers' job" OP mentioned a "flyer", I didn't really interpret the situation as a designer producing bad product, but more of a reporting task that was being done poorly.
Perhaps not, but if that's the reality... &lt;ducks&gt; Consider for example what happens if a programming language decides to go from version 2 to version 3 with incompatible changes. &lt;/ducks&gt;
&gt; who I assume has more jobs than sending out shitty fliers, but automating it is one less job for that person. This was my point. I think most people would be glad to have rote/repetitive tasks automated, and obviously their input would be invaluable for *designing the program in the first place!*.
I was laughing so much that I couldn't click on the up arrow. Need I say any more, nudge, nudge, wink, wink?
Awesome and perfect timing too! My son has asthma. I know asthma can be different for different people, but what I've been seeing is my son will most likely have asthma when there is a significant change in barometric pressure. I was going to collect data to confirm and then use web scraping to get forecasted barometric pressure. Additionally, I was going to use machine learning to train on the difference in barometric pressures and provide an asthma yes or no labeling. So basically tackle it as a supervised ML classification problem.

The newlines that you're seeing are coming from the `print` command, not `raw_input`. The duplicate input is due to the fact that both your local terminal and the remote terminal are echoing your input. You need to tell one of them not to echo. This is easier to do for the remote terminal, if possible.
I have a simple bash script to rerun the input &lt;arbitrary number&gt; of lines back in history with corrections. This is obviously built in... unless you're connected via a terminal that will not pass control keys or characters to the server. *cough*telnet
You should change the script from every 2 minutes to every few waking hours.

Yes pretty sad isn't it. There's a little excerpt about this on Frank Ocean's "Blond" album... a french man talking about how his relationship was damaged by refusing to connect with his partner on FB when the real world was right there for them both.

Regarding the first one, I'd really like to recommend Pentaho: http://community.pentaho.com/projects/data-integration/ It's a tool I use on a daily basis, there's a free community version, it allows you do create jobs way too easily and you can control the whole automation through any job scheduler (including cron). Plus, you wouldn't have to worry about the accuracy of your parser, and yeah, it can run in background. I really love the rest of your automations.

This should be posted on r/learnpython This is too big a topic in Python to simplify much. Python is similar to Java in how everything inherits from a base class. Except they're in no way comparable outside of this over-generalization. Maybe Quora is a good place to ask about this. You have to get into the type system, inheritance system, and encapsulation of Python to show how classes are different between it and another language like Java or PHP.

Have you considered hooking your IoT projects into [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)? It's basically *the* smart home hub for Python - you can easily plug in your own custom components, but the real advantage is the reporting and automation backend.

That is a strange reaction, since i detailed a perfectly valid solution to the (admittedly, horribly described) problem by OP. Infact, it will be much less brittle than a regex.
You make your project structure in a way that pip can use it. Then on your new machine you call pip install my_project and pip takes care of installing dependencies if needed. More info: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/ If all you want is a fast way to install a bunch of dependencies, you can list them in a file called requirements.txt and then ask pip to install all of them (if needed) pip install -r requirements.txt --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin.

I'm not sure how easily available it is - I know for a fact that the various fitness apps on my Android phone (MyFitnessLife, etc) can pull data from Samsung Health if it has the permissions granted. It might be easiest to get the data into one of those that has a rest API available and go from there. Keep us updated, this sounds like a really cool project that I bet can benefit a huge number of people if its streamlined! I've been wondering if I had hypoglycemic issues for a long time and have been terrible about keeping track of my food intake and exercise and everything else.. One button that pulled in my workout exertion, caloric intake, dietary mess ups etc would be great for tracking down why I feel bad on some random day when I felt great the day before.

&gt;Too complicated... Too many tools to install and configure seriously? the walkthrough literally allows you to just copy/paste the commands into your terminal. if installing the SDK is too complicated, you're not going to get very far with embedded systems, regardless of your IDE.
This is really interesting, could you give some more details on what tools you used to do that?
Awesome!!
Awesome! That's one of my concerns with a model that tries to generalize is that different allergens, weather, etc impact different people differently. I'm sure there's an algorithm that can account for this variation. I've been using mixed effects GLMs a lot at work; maybe that could work for this?

What makes you think the problem is uwsgi and not your Flask app? Killing the uwsgi process might work by unsticking a stuck thing in Flask. 
Well the app is a single file module: from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def hello_world(): return 'Hello, World!' I'm not sure where it would hang.
I originally learned R then learned some Python. I use both nowadays. I find that R does a much better and more intuitive job working with dataframes (thanks to data.table mostly). R also has huge amount of easily implementable statistics/econometrics packages that Python doesn't. For everything else there's Python. 
QPython app to use python on my phone. Other than that, I only have: from html.parser import HTMLParser from http import client import re
Yeah. In that case, I'd just switch to gunicorn. I've tried to use uwsgi before, but the docs are awful. 
Just a bit of additional info for others that come across this thread, but In Python 3 the format command also allows converting integers to a str of bits. Just for fun, here is a crude bitstream reader that takes a file or file-like object, and lets you pull arbitrary numbers of bits at a time. This is probably terribly slow, but it might serve to illustrate use of the format command. class BitstreamReader(object): """Read bits from file-like objects. Takes a file or file-like object, and allows retrieval of an arbitrary number of bits. """ def __init__(self, fileobj): self.fileobj = fileobj self.bit_buffer = "" def get_bits(self, size): while len(self.bit_buffer) &lt; size: integer = int(self.fileobj.read(1).hex(), 16) self.bit_buffer = format(integer, '08b') + self.bit_buffer bits = self.bit_buffer[-size:] self.bit_buffer = self.bit_buffer[0:-size] return bits

Great idea!
Keep using Godot, there's nothing comparable available for Python. All the Python frameworks/engines look really rudimentary if you compare them to Godot. Also, you'll probably be able to use [Python as a scripting language](https://godotengine.org/article/beta-release-python-support) in Godot 3.0. Edit: If you just want to use one of the Python game frameworks to learn programming or the language or have fun with simple projects, then it doesn't matter much which one you choose. Pygame has probably one of the biggest communities and nice learning resources like [Program Arcade Games](http://programarcadegames.com/) and is pretty easy to use, but it's kind of slow (the devs are trying to upgrade it to SDL2 atm, though). Cocos-2d is pretty nice. It's based on pyglet and should be faster than pygame and it also has some interesting features. There don't seem to be many people who use it, so it could be difficult to find help. If you need physics, there's [Pymunk](http://pymunk.org/). But if you mainly want to make games, stick with Godot, since it has tons of features more than the Python frameworks. I've posted a [short list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6n1s6f/game_engine_with_python/dk6ho50/) a while ago.
I learned python first, then R. I now prefer R for most things relative to data. The tidyverse is unmatched. Pandas + numpy is strong, but R just seems cleaner to me. Plus, it's inherently meant to be a language for data analysis, so there are just more helpful features built in automatically. I also enjoy the arrows. 
If you were doing this on paper, how would you get started? From there, think about how you would translate that into a program. Don't over think it initially, just do on Python exactly what you would have done on paper. Then as a round 2, maybe abstract a bit and have the starting amount be entered - and the number of years be entered - but that's abstracting out the math equation side of things and the programming just naturally follows along.
I suppose I am having a hard time with the language versus the actual math that is involved. Thank you for your help. 
Let me ask this... What is the math involved here? The actual formula. If you can write that here, then a bit of algebra can get you to where you need to go in python. Another way to take this - what do you have now? You haven't given a starting point for me to see what you have done so far and where to give pointers. What I'm not going to do is solve the problem for you. I'm happy to help you solve it though.
Virtual environments and requirements files. Much easier that way.

Early on, I found making a really robust web scraper for a couple of sites that required authentication to be really informative. I learned a lot about the way http works, and I learned to use the famous requests library, as well as bs4. From the other side, programming in a web framework like Flask or Django might be an interesting next step. 
&gt; Thanks Brad !!! 
HMMMMM
Yes, but it uses Insragram API which is difficult to set up and you should add accounts to sandbox (you should know login and password of a target account), I did all this setups and I was banned by Instagram for too many requests, so this is not working solution
I'm a long time Python user, newly picking up R. Does anyone have a few words about the consistency of the naming and use of packages in R vs Python? Does using a new R package feel more consistent/intuitive based on finding similar structure or naming conventions for similar functions across packages? I've always been a Python advocate, but I'm using R now in my Data Science courses (I've also used MATLAB and JMP, so I appreciate the consistency of domain specific languages/environments despite their abstraction-scaling limits.)
I just checked what you can to with Garmin activity trackers (models like the Vivosmart HR, for example). 24/7 HR is synced via bluetooth, and you can download .fit files, for which there are converters to CSV. I checked some data, and even though it's clearly my 24/7 heart rate, it could probably do with some cleanup (very noisy during a run with higher heart rates, for example, see [plot](https://i.imgur.com/6p6KWFH.png)). The point is: it seems to be possible, once you figure out how to get the data out of Garmin Connect in an automated fashion, and then clean it up.

Not really. A large part of why I do these projects is to learn how to do it myself. Outsourcing all that work to a third party tool would defeat the purpose for me.
This isn't fully automated, but I have some security auditing stuff I have to do at work where the spreadsheet can sometimes have 15k rows. I tend to clean up with find/replace on legitimate items, and then I have a python script that just deletes all rows under a certain length. This clears out all the junk values for me, leaving only legitimate data once it's culled.
I use Docker for this type of problem. The Dockerfile in your project directory instructs docker how to build your app and all required dependencies, whether they are python packages or other system libraries like libcurl or Java or whatever you need. Your app then runs in a virtualized container. The benefits of this over virtualenv are many, but ease of deploying on another computer is biggest. Virtualenv is a great tool for isolating dependencies on your own computer, or another computer of the same hardware, but can run into problems when using a different OS or underlying hardware (though not always). 
That's a good reason! 
Good hustle for being patient with this person. You're a better teacher than I can be.
Having done recently made the transition from Groovy to Python myself, I often miss Spock's line assertions. Typing 'self.assertTrue' gets old.
You - and OP - just need to start using Pytest! For bonus points, also pick up Hypothesis :) 
There are a lot of levels to this unfortunately. I had to battle a bunch of them for something I was doing. I found that the easiest thing to do was to just use Conda. That covers most of the basis and will usually be enough. Sometimes though you'll still run into having to compile underlying libraries for the architecture you're running on (or download pre-compiled ones). If you'd like to see an example, I had to get some python code from Ubuntu (version 3.6) to work on Windows x64. I had to downgrade to 3.4, because a compiled wheel was only available for that version. In the ReadMe you can see me going from virtualenv to Conda on the directions for install :). For most things it seems like Conda just works though. https://github.com/darkhipo/Easy-Digraph-Draw
I cannot recommend `py.test` enough. It circumvents `unittest` *shudder*, you write tests like functions, you can have test fixtures, you can do coverage. The list is endless. Python doesn't really need another testing framework.

I went on a long rant, so tl;dr is I like R more because it supports functional programming more elegantly and has better plotting libraries, but I also still use and enjoy both. I learned R first, but not really. I only spent a few weeks with it, found out really tough to understand the syntax and all the weird base functions. Then I learned python and fell in love. Python code when starting out is so easy to read, basically reading just like you would explain the logic in plain English. After a year of python and getting real work done, I spent a summer using R because that's what my intern knew. I came to appreciate some of the naive data structures in R, particularly data frames and posix compliant date/time types. I also found the amazing IDE RStudio. I then took a grad school statistics course that was taught in R and since I had just spent the summer learning R + RStudio, I had a really great time learning all the built in stats functions and plotting functions with R. Then I learned about ggplot2 and dplyr and never looked back... Until tensorflow came along then I had to start using python again. I found support for pandas had skyrocketed and it was much easier to quickly find answers on how to reshape data than I remembered, and also how useful object oriented programming can be. To this day, I still use both and recommend data scientists learn both languages. Python, IMHO, is better when coding web sites, web scrapers, NLP and textual analysis, and building RESTful APIs. However, R is much better at processing tabular data, doing exploratory data analysis, plotting and creating graphics, and automating reports. Both are good at machine learning and statistical learning, but R has better support for time series modelling typically done in finance and econometrics, while Python has more support for deep learning (i.e. more frameworks, not necessarily better frameworks) and a more consistent API for machine learning (scikit learn in Python vs caret in R). If you know and enjoy object oriented programming solutions, you'll probably enjoy python more. If you enjoy functional programming and the philosophy behind the paradigm, you'll find R and the tidyverse to be very welcoming. Both options are great for data science. You can be successful using both. I still prefer R for new projects because that usually means a lot of exploration and visualization. That said, I pretty much strictly use python and scikit learn for starting kaggle competitions. I like R more in general, but I like python for specific things. * P.S. I've also spent some time learning Scala and while I enjoyed the functional paradigm options, I found it much harder to find good example code because every source online is implemented differently. Both R and Python communities typically have preferred approaches for problems ( like using lapply in R or list comprehension in Python instead of writing for loops), but Scala was like the wild West where the more concise, possibly logically incorrect, and difficult to understand solutions were upvoted and the longer, easier to understand and obviously logically correct solutions were criticized. Not saying you shouldn't use Scala though because it pays $$$ due to everyone jumping on Spark. ** P.S.S. I've also spent time learning Go, which I have enjoyed and plan to continue using. It's a good option for replacing some projects that I would normally do in Python, such a building a simple REST API. Go also has a surprisingly more robust data science ecosystem than I expected. There's good matrix support via gonum (akin to numpy) and a decent machine learning API in golearn (akin to scikit learn). There huge benefits of writing go over R or python are ease of deployment and easy of writing concurrent code. Once your go code works and compiles, you can just share that binary with anyone. That's it. No setup or requirements or installs or anything, just execute the binary. This means your sysadmins or devops will love you, which means your code will get put into production faster. It also means your code won't just randomly stop working since it is unchanging binary (though the source code might not compile anymore). 
I will recommend using Visual Studio Code. It's free and you can install it on Mac. VS Code is basically only an editor but, using extensions you can turn it into an IDE easily

My Raspberry is subscribed to an iCloud calendar called "Roomba", which tells it when to clean. When it is time, it will transmit to go-code over an RF24 to an Arduino on the Roomba. Roomba has a quite extensive manual on controlling your Roomba (iRobot Create Open Interface), but I just tells it to start and clean.
I learned R first, then python. I'd say R is the better language. It's full of features and tricks. I'd also say R has by far better data manipulation capabilities. I don't see why people like numpy/pandas so much. Oh, maybe due to vectorization? Well, it's built right into R, so... Anyway, I landed at python as I'm doing a project which needs a but more structure. R is great, but doing OOP in R is a different can of worms. Python is better there. Plus the test framework, I don't think there is something like test framework in R at all... well it was never intended to be a programming language. So yeah, python is more of a programming language now evolving into data science, which is a pity because it's not as good as R for that and it's join going to dilute the ecosystem. R was and is a framework for working with data.
Absolutely agree. Here's a link for that one: [Python 3 Metaprogramming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI) Another one of his I really enjoyed: [Discovering Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4Sn-Y7AP8)
Nope, hate hype beast stuff. It's something else
R has testthat for testing. In base R, you're expected to use the various is.Class and is.Type functions... Which is not always enough. Try testthat because it is great. Obviously testing in Python has been thought out more thoroughly, but not absent from R.
It sounds like what you probably need is virtualenv, pip, and setuptools. Setuptools (from setuptools import setup) is the stdlib way to define and build packages, including their name, version, and dependencies. Pip is a tool to download and install python packages (pip install tkinter, .tgz, .whl, etc), using pypi.org as the default artifact repository. And finally virtualenv allows you to install dependencies for your projects in an isolated sub folder. Conda if not on Unix. If you want to go further, into the creation of portable, self contained binaries, you need to know a bit more about the target system. For Windows you might use py2exe or similar programs, and in Unix you'd look at pex or pyinstaller. Each of these has its tradeoffs, and in Unix land you probably have to build multi-platform artifacts depending on your targets. As others have suggested, a docker image might also be an attractive option. But for non-linux users, running a VM to run a container sounds like a little much compared to taking a little more effort to package native code. 
Just so that no matter how bad it was, you can feel a little glimmer of regret when you gc.collect()
Yeah it was a script, thanks.
Short answer is no, not really. Long answer is yes, more and more every day. Best advice for R is look for packages in or compliant with the tidyverse. I think you'll find consistency between packages from the same academic domain, like econometrics or biostatistics or ecology. I don't think you'll find that consistency between more generic packages or implementations of various data structures and algorithms by people from different fields. However, the more recently the package was written or refactored, the more likely it will be consistent with modern R (which is highly tied to functional programming and the tidyverse). The ecosystem for R has changed rapidly over the past 3-4 years. Just a four years ago there were only about 4000 packages you could install from R. Today there are over 10000. In addition, almost 1/4 of those packages depend on Rcpp (R bindings for C++). This means there are a lot more things possible in R now, but also means the packages available now are generally faster. In short, the diversity of R programmers has increased and that includes very experienced computer scientists and software engineers. This increase in interest in the language has brought many improvements. Onto main difference... In Python, packages are usually object oriented. Since you started you already know python, I'll assume you get that paradigm. In R, most packages are hybrid OOP and functional paradigm. This can be weird. For example, the print function in base R works as you might expect. What you might not expect is that it is a really a method on top of a ton of different classes. Depending on what you pass into print, you might get totally different outputs (try printing a string, a vector of strings, a dataframe, and a linear model). In Python, you would never see that. Instead you'd have to instantiate your object of a specific class and then call the print method on it. In R, much of the OOP is hidden from the user. This often confuses experienced programmers and newcomers. In fact, there are 3 common variations of OOP in R (S3, S4, and R6). Different people prefer different options, but the best part of R is that you rarely need to use OOP to solve problems. In fact, OOP is often inferior to functional programming when programming data science tasks. 
That's a great explanation, a lot more than I'd hoped for, thanks! I'll certainly keep an eye out for the tidyverse and functional side of R. Not much of the latter in Python.
Protocol Buffers isn't faster than cPickle. The pure Python Protobuf library is *really* slow, and even the one that wraps the C++ library is slower than cPickle. I recently finished a project that was serializing tons of messages, and cPickle was 2-3 times faster than Protobuf.
&gt; Monitors the traffic on my street and sends a weekly complaint email to my local police department alerting them to the trends of speeders (Live on a 20mph residential neighborhood and regularly get people going 40 to 50mph around the blind corner in front of my house). Cops actually appreciate my emails and I've been thanked by the guys who sit out front running speed traps because they have been able to dial in on the speeders. Dick move. They shouldn't be speeding, but way to be a busy body who gets the cops involved. Neighbors will definitely have a target on your back if they find out.
I disagree. py.test still "tastes" like Python, still has much of it's boilerplate and still carries baggage. The list of features that you've described are features which though already exist, can be added to any framework.
&gt; py.test still "tastes" like Python This is a positive when what you're writing is Python, Shirley?
I love Python, I really do. The purpose of Nimoy is not to program in Groovy. Spock has given me inspiration to create a Pythonic DSL for better testing
Just put it there now and perhaps others can help you clean it up. It would mean more people can get helped by it sooner.

You can put single quotes in strings wrapped by double quotes and vice versa. It's the lazy way to avoid writing messy code and using backslashes to escape characters. Just like `\n`, you have `\"`.
I'm sympathetic - `unittest` is somewhere between an abomination and a tire fire, but those who care know that already and use `pytest` instead. It'll help a lot if you can also compare Nimpy to pytest, and describe what you want to do differently!
This is an awesome idea. I think you can also upgrade it by making two playlists, one more morning and one for evening depending on the time it is played. I will try something similar also. Thank you! 
I tried fiddling around with it and it seems the only way to do it is with some kind of crawler or browser stimulator. To use the official API I'd need to actually publish an app and get approval to access actual data and info. (I was trying to find people that use some tags for my subreddit) 
Yeah but it would be trivial for her to plot those distributions and notice they were just too random - nobody would fall for that. To have a slightly better chance you might train a machine-learning model or something to replicate your natural behaviour, plus a bit of randomness. After an extended period even that will become obviously artificial but let's face it I don't think OP is gonna need this for very long.
True, I also tried to work with official API and it's terrible, that's why I use unofficial API methods

It's a long paper so I might have missed it, but is there a repo anywhere that has the source for all these solutions? I'd love to see a comparison of "real world" python solutions rather than pure python ones, since most of these problems are ones you'd end up handing off to numpy in the real world.
For production code-I agree. For tests-less. No programming language is flawless, so why not try to improve it a little? Tests are the perfect playground for these sort of things

Do you know how to program in any other programming languages? I do (Java,C#,C++,Assembly,etc.), and tomorrow I'm going to do something that's wayyy overdue. I'm going to teach myself Python in one day (because it's super cool &amp; formatting means less control characters). Also don't ignore "boring" videos. Take the time to do a "Hello World." Then build something that asks the user for two numbers, and adds them together. After that build something like a text based tic, tac, toe. Goal setting is the number priority if you want to learn to program. If you are brand new to programming, it's so easy to get lost, and disinterested. That's understandable as we've all been there at one point or another. I can gladly give you assignments (like a professor would), and then grade your results/ give you any help. Just PM me if you're interested!
How flexible is the sources it allows?
I don't understand your problem...
I've created a wrapper in python, which currently supports GET method only. I wanted to implement other verbs like "POST,PUT,DELETE" etc in it. So let say to get the list of all fruits the call will be: client.list("fruits").get() and I want to have similar statement but instead of 'get' I can change it to 'post' with payload like this client.list("fruits").post("apple") 
when triggered it renames video files and copies to a NAS if the file being moved doesn't already exist on the NAS or does exist but is newer. if it's part of a set, it places the file in a folder hierarchy if it exists , if not, it creates the folder hierarchy. i do db backups of media players nightly 
Ok ..I will check it out 
Even jupyter notebook with propers extension : I have a variable inspector and an autosave on line.
Make `list("fruits")` return an object that has `get()` and `post()` methods.
What... You're asking how to declare methods?
No, I am struggling with the multi dot operator. I couldn't understand. A code snippet example would be useful to understand its working.
There is no such thing as "multi dot operator"...
Okay, so is there a way to do this: client.list.get() client.list.delete(id=3) client.list.put(id=2,data="done") client.list.post(id=1,data="check") I am able to understand how to put it in this way: client.list(get) client.list(delete,id=3) client.list(put,id=2,data="done") client.list(post,id=1,data="check") 
Could you explain this with code?
This is called [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) and it's accomplished by returning an object that implements the method that you wanna call next. class Client: def list(self, datatype): if datatype != 'fruit': raise ValueError('fruit is my manna') return List(['orange', 'mango', 'banana', 'orange']) class List: def __init__(self, data): self._data = data def get(self, datasubtype): self._data = [f for f in self._data if f == datasubtype] return self def number(self): return len(self._data) &gt;&gt;&gt; client = Client() &gt;&gt;&gt; client.list('fruit').get('orange').number() 2
**Method chaining** Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results. Local variable declarations are syntactic sugar because of the difficulty humans have with deeply nested method calls. A method chain is also known as a train wreck due to the increase in the number of methods that come one after another in the same line that occurs as more methods are chained together even though line breaks are often added between methods. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

I don't clean it up, I just work around it. The Excel comes to me in the same format every time so it's very easy for me to tell my script to just 'tab' three times "read".
I have a RPi with a camera . The RPi is running [this](https://github.com/gregtinkers/carspeed.py) script and if a speed is in excess of 32mph it adds the time of the occurrence to a database. At the end of the week my home server will construct an email to send to the PD. That email contains standard stuff I've added, the times of the fastest three drivers, and then a bar graph detailing the number of speeders per hour. And for clarity, the cops are aware I have a program that does this. At first they thought I was some old guy who had nothing better to do, but some sergeant ended up coming out due to the number of emails I sent and I showed him my setup. 
Wow, greate bot. I train neural networks a lot. Fitting usually takes long time. So, I create telgram bot(called [telepyth](https://telegram.me/telepyth_bot) like telepath) that send notification to me in Telegram because I do not want waste my time on regular checking of training process. I just wrap cell in jupyter notebook with ipython-magic and go to do my business. Telepyth can send markdown formatted messages, figures or event catch exception and send stack traces. It is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/daskol/telepyth) and provide isolation for different users. Now 20 people use it. Most of them are data scientist or analysts.
Thanks! I got sick of the speeders on our street. And then my daughter went from crawling to walking to running and after the second time she got into the road before we could get to her we installed a fence, a gate, and I started complaining about the speeders.
I'll look into it. Python is definitely not the best way to do it. For a while I was actually using AHK, because I couldn't figure out how to get Python to simulate keys.

The dick move is driving 50mph in a residential zone filled with children and cars parked on the side of the road. My neighbors are all aware and think it's just fine. Cops are a daily part of our lives, we live in a pretty poor part of town. We're all very happy to see the police around, and they've done a fantastic job at removing the drugs and the gangs, now they need to just get the speeders.
Think so, normally minor problems are just warnings to bigger ones.. Still though, i really like what he's built 👍🏻
Thanks mate. Looks like I've got a new project!
You will get a better response posting on [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/). Make sure to post the code you are using.
Python is changing the way it's built, that's why. It started off as a scripting language that no one but beginners should use, now it's turning into a scripting language that is easy to build up with. pretty cool I just wish it wasn't so hard to debug/read without running.
So if she posts something really terrible or writes "my BF is an idiot" you will auto like it?
I would definitely recommend you to check https://pythonprogramming.net There are topics covered from basics to advanced level. And the website owner has a youtube channel too, it's called sentdex. His videos helped me a lot.
[Stop Writing Classes](http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2012/stop-writing-classes.html) is by Jack Diederich. But there's also [The Art of Subclassing](http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2012/the-art-of-subclassing.html) by Raymond Hettinger from the same conference. :)
Why isn't it easy to read? 
Would you have any screenshot on what a report looks like (with you censuring sensitive infos) ? This seems interesting
Yes use virtual environments and install all deoendencies by getting a list of dependecies with `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` and install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Hey look into an app called Nomie2. It's free and let's you easily track anything. Anytime you track an event, it will also track location and time. I have mine automatically syncing to a pi at home, but you could just as easily let it sync up to something like Chunkhost. The api is easy so you can also easily pull the data out of the NoSQL format into MySQL or whatever. 
I like it. Go ahead!
If you want to learn how to do that, /r/learnpython. If you want someone to do it for you, /r/forhire.
Hmm... there are a lot of positive adjectives I would use: * Bigger * More feature complete * Easier to use * More succinct but cleaner is not one of them.
Post a screenshot of your code in IDLE.
I make no argument about how feature-complete [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames are or how useable. I merely note their existence for the interested reader and that one of pandas's main goals is to replicate R's dataframes within python.
Python is hard to read?!? The whole point is readability...
I've been working on a site that scrapes news articles from various sources, allows users to comment, vote up/down. The site can scrape via php on the site and I've written a python script to do the same which works on my local server but I want to eventually move to hosting with python as cron job support so it will scrap at set intervals.
A quiz that uploads questions/answers from a .csv and saves scores into a .csv Conway's Game of Life running in an array A poker dice game A simple adventure game A sudoku solver A simple image processor (colour to B&amp;W, blurring, rotating/inverting) Hangman 
&gt; So yeah, python is more of a programming language now evolving into data science, I would definitely agree with this &gt; which is a pity because it's not as good as R for that and it's join going to dilute the ecosystem. When I think about this I think in terms of do-what-I-mean languages versus do-what-I-say language. I would put R in the category of a do what I mean language rather than do-what-I-say language. I would class perl as a do-what-i-mean language, and bash. With do-what-i-say languages you understand precisely what the language is doing, but you might have to describe it with a lot of detail. With do-what-i-mean languages they 'just work'. The complexity of the tasks that you are trying to do determines which type of language is better. At at a certain point do-what-i-mean languages can becomes unmaintainable (or tend to become so without a good does of procedures), the question is where the types of problem that R solves fall on this spectrum The comment that OOP in R is difficult is perhaps part of a more general pattern: programmer in R can be hard. 
codecademy has an interactive python programme, it's amazing. www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python
Python has been used by many advanced users, primarily even, for decades. Nothing has changed about the nature of Python. Also python is incredibly readable, so I'm not sure what you're referring to by saying it's hard to read and debug.
There is something to the complaint that python testing side isn't right. I'm a java-head interloping in python-land. I didn't particularly like junit, thought testNG had some limitations, enjoyed Spock for some months, before being pulled back to the pure java impls. Then there was brave guys/gal's framework using lambdas a few years ago. Lastly G/W/T frameworks were a thing. I wish someone had told me early on that unittest was dead. I miss Mockito, and wish that the python version would catch up. I wish there was cohesive documentation including examples for everything in the python unit test and mocking world. Too much of the time I have to depend on stackoverflow and it does not always have the answer. I can write tests quite quickly in python, but when I hit a problem and my google-fu lets me down, I find that I'm sometimes in an elastic place to complete the chore, and severely regretful about spending time on that and not something else. One more thing PyTest's string equals sucks. Yet another reminder that hamcrest's one is sorely needed in python. 
Sry new to Reddit..I don't seem to see any image sharing button here..
Upload it to imgur.com
Very good to know. I'll look into it. Thanks!
I've automated a lot of my job (distribution manager) with python. Big ones are when new invoices are entered in our system, it creates a task on a check list with the due date as the ship date, and also sends an SMS to all my warehouse guys. I've also built automated email payment reminder emails with SQL/Python - means every customer gets a late payment email 5 days after due, 15 days after due, and then at 30 days it emails them with me cc'd and I give them a call to chase payment. Simple stuff, but a million times more reliable then my forgetful brain. 
I put this script in cron on my notebook, so when my notebook is off the bot doesn't work
No types, very abstract, etc. etc. If you're using Python as a programming language, it's very hard to read.
Yes. readability for beginners, as a scripting langauge. but most don't use it like that. Languages like java and C# are much easier to read w/o execution.
Much has changed about the nature of Python. Just look at the log.
Yup uploaded it to imgur with a new account..now?
Now post the link here.
 A change log doesn't indicate a change in the nature of a project. It just shows progression, whether in keeping with the current nature or not. What has changed in Python in the last decade that you think has made it better for advanced users?
After all, bugs are common in any relationships 
If I changed the wheels on my car to tackle all-terrain, is it a new car or has it just changed? how is this not getting through to you??
I love Python, but it does have its oddities. For me, the biggest one is that a = b assigns a value to a if b is immutable, a number for example. However, it assigns a reference to b if it is mutable, like a list.
Your lines are made by you and not by a stranger from internet. Each and every situations are different from its roots. So we can't judge you and you two are bold enough to compare which is good and which is not in your relationship. Period. Sorry for my bad English 
Well the use case for python is different than those two languages. Backend / server side python is very easy to read (especially Django) especially when compared to PHP and Perl. Rails is also easy to read but you can organize it however you like and it gives you plenty of rope to hang yourself.
I think this may speak to just your own personal preferences as a programmer. It's clearly not reflective of the Python community as a whole, which includes things like: * The most popular machine learning libraries * Core parts of the most popular Linux distros * Running some of the biggest social media sites on the internet * Use by thousands of scientists around the world * Used in every major feature film in the last decade Clearly not hard to read or use. Also python is a typed language. Every object has a type and it is strongly typed as well. 
That sounds reasonable to me. You could also run a web UI on the server that actually stores the files, and then cut off direct access to the file system entirely. The users can then change the settings through your web UI, which will generate and write proper config files.
It would be the same car. You changed the tires, but it doesn't change what the car is. Your car suddenly isn't a 4 wheel drive car just because you got better tires. What would you say is a big change in Python that has made it better for advanced users as you originally said?
I never said it wasn't useful. &gt;Clearly not hard to read or use. Wrong. Python is hard to read without execution. &gt;Also python is a typed language. A typed language, there are no types to read through though. You are overcomplicating this and contradicting yourself.
Except for when the shitty dev writes all his Java with basically no indentation, on one line lol.
Again I think you are taking your ~~experiences~~ preferences and applying it to everyone. Where would you say I am contradicting myself? I would appreciate if you'd answer at least one of my questions please. 
I was bored. I wanted something fun to do. I also took it as an opportunity to learn Pillow. I also think Weather Underground has a similar thing that can be done for free. I've updated my post to reflect that though, I should have been a little more forward.
Python isn't hard to use without execution in my opinion. Youre allowed your opinion, but we are allowed ours too. And if one is really desperate enough to want stated types on every variable and function, python does that, it's called a comment.
"No types" and "very abstract" are what make Python very *easy* to read for me. You must come from a background where you have to think carefully about every byte. That's perfectly fine, but it's not what Python is for.
Java. Easy to read. I get it now, you're just trolling.
I wish I was that forward-thinking. It is a good reason though!
Sounds like you want a context manager.
Nope. Simple assignment always just binds a reference. Check out this article and presentation, it explains the situation quite well: https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html &gt; Myth: Python assigns mutable and immutable values differently.
&gt;"No types" and "very abstract" are what make Python very easy to read for me. lol. yes I mentioned using it as a scripting language. No, I come from a background of understanding large-scale projects. You must be the beginner, which I've already pointed out will have no problem using python. You'll get there one day buddy. 
Can you show some examples for my situation?
Can you explain your goal in more detail?
CONFIRMED FOR ENORMOUS TROLL. EVERYONE BACK DOWN. DO NOT FEED THE ENORMOUS TROLL. THIS HAS BEEN A PSA.
Use `raise` by itself inside the `except` block to re-raise that exception.
Why do you think this person is a beginner? Have they done anything to indicate that or deserve your condescending attitude? As I mentioned in another post, python is the backbone of many large projects that serve millions of users every day. The use of Python doesn't make it a language for beginners.
I don't think they're a troll, looking at their post history. I think they're just a poor programmer with a poor skillset and understanding of languages. Edit: he even pm'd me now. Afaik reddit doesn't stop you by commenting frequency just by submission frequency. &gt; I have to wait 10mins between posts, you can be sure I'm not wasting that time communicating with you. &gt; You're clueless, and I don't know how. &gt; just messaging you to save you and I some time. Edit 2: They're also incapable of replying properly too it seems
[removed]
nah I'm not a troll. but nice try. twice that the "ur a troll omg confirmed" trash reaction has been made. It's amazing how upset some people can get when you spit some truth. Too bad you can't come up with any better retort. thanks tho for showing that I was right. &gt;I don't think they're a troll, looking at their post history. I think they're just a poor programmer with a poor skillset and understanding of languages. This made me laugh though. C'mon buddy, didn't mean to hurt your feelings. You have no idea what you're saying and then you say something as obviously false as this? hahah &gt;Edit: he even pm'd me now to berate me. Nope. Yeah I feel bad for upsetting you now though. I won't be wasting any more time on the beginner programmers here getting upset that the language they grasp onto has flaws (and benefits, lol).
'Actively developed' for cocos2d is stretching it a bit. There has been a few updates but the vast majority of the development activity has moved to the C++ cocos2d-x version. 
Sorry I dont know about GLM. I just use traditional ML using scikit-learn. I think for my purposes, using Deep Learning is overkill. Right now, I need to decide on the time period for the difference in barometric pressures, 2-day rolling versus 3-day or more as part of my feature data set. I googled for correlation of barometric pressure to rate of asthma incidence, studies indicated no correlation, but they used just absolute value, not the change or rate of change in barometric pressure. My son's asthma definitely gets worse or starts when the weather changes, especially between seasons.
I love python so much I think there should be an OS built around python. Python should replace javascript in browsers too. I'm currently using pySFML, and it's the greatest thing ever.
By the way, check out /r/learnpython
&gt; auto mating :D
Idk, direct engagement like that screams sociopathy to me.
"Nothing personnel kid"
I /think/ centOS is python. *Could be mistaken
Can you share the script?
yes u are
You need to use `except:` if you want to catch all exceptions that were not caught otherwise.
Thank you, this gave me a good laugh.
Asyncio is probably up there. I'd bet type hinting and the way unicode is handled probably hasn't hurt. Who here was really using Python 3 10 years ago? My guess is not many.
Not, for different exceptions, I need different log messages, but for all of them, I need some common code. 
Now we’re talking. Bring tensor flow into into this!
For different exceptions, I need different log messages, but for all of them, I also need common log information with input arguments and additional diagnostic. 
Sounds like a cron job to me...
Fuck off sad boy we rnt ur buddies
That's a fair point. There was a new release last month, and there are active maintainers, so I would still be comfortable recommending it to beginners as it is.
CentOS is Linux therefore C. It has high level bits built in Python though but definitely not the OS itself
Or adjust the settings in the app to notify you 
I love that you've asked this 3 times to no reply lmao
Those are new features sure but have they changed the nature of Python where they appeal more to advanced users? I prefer python 3 but python was much used by many professionals on python 2 and still is. Barring async in language , most of what's new in py3 could be done (granted not as nicely) in py2. I've said python has evolved but nothing has changed the core nature of it as a programming language to make it more appealing for advanced users versus beginners which was the Crux of their arguments
TIL you can like python on Facebook and follow python on twitter. Is there a script to do this? I do not like to actually go on those sites.
Same for my son, but the different allergens in the air impact him too: like ragweed vs juniper, etc. I hit it hard last night so hopefully I can have some code up on github this weekend. Would love to make this helpful/practical for non-coders too.
This doesn't surprise me. It's a simple but effective but also deep language if you want it to be, with something to offer anyone. I'm not the best with it, and I don't use it often enough, but Python is still my programming mistress I sneak out with when I want a quickie and C++ keeps telling me "not today, dear."
That's the plan. I would chmod -x the folders so they won't even be able to see the structure/contents of what they're editing and just give people a UI :) Though I'd probably do it with PyQt since I'm more familiar with that but I'm still researching how this is done so I'm open to anything Edit: Oh I see. you meant to literally store those config files outside the filesystem on the server itself. That's a great idea!
I looked into this. I'll probably end up using it. Very promising. 
&gt; We found it a familiar replacement but he didn't like it. That's because [you fulfilled the ancient threat](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=go%20away%20or%20I%20will%20replace%20you%20with%20a%20simple%20shell%20script), albeit in a different language :P
*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***go away or I will replace you with a simple shell script***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=go%20away%20or%20i%20will%20replace%20you%20with%20a%20simple%20shell%20script) : --- &gt;Shell scripts don't require salaries and don't complain about yesterdays coffee. You should pay more attention to the creative possibilities of shell scripts, especially in relation to human resources. &gt;the sentence shown here is incorrect.

Yes, but what I mean is that your code doesn't do anything with an exception other than `OSError` and `subprocess.CalledProcessError` so you might want to add `except: exception_happened = True` after the other `except` blocks.
What about calling a function?
Could you share the Imgur one?
Really? Meet a sociopath. 
Why was this downvoted?
If more than a certain amount of other men like her images? ;-)
If you want to start a program perodically, then as /u/henrebotha points out, cron is the way to go. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md If your program is continually resisdent and you want it to act at a set time you can periodically sleep by calling `time.sleep()`. When you wake up, you check the time (use the `datetime` library; don't try to do the time code yourself as it will break when the clock changes for DST etc and how many days are in April?). If it's time to do something, you do it. Otherwise you go back to sleep. There are libraries that make this easier. Look for "python daemon library" on google/pypi. Daemon is what this kind of program is called on unix (technically it disconnects from the terminal, and continues running). here's na example of one: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/
The fact that people use Python 2.7 is a weak argument. I use Python 2.7 and 3.6. You can do almost everything with Python 2.7, but the same goes for favorite dependencies. Why do you upgrade? Are there really a ton new features you couldn't make do without or is it because you don't want bugs? It's also very hard to fix unicode bugs working solely on Python 2. A month ago, my boss wanted to use Python 2.7.5 on some LTS Linux he just installed. He integrated my library into his working script and it broke. My software didn't work and it was a crisis. Did you see the Python 2.7.8 requirement; you're 7 years out of date. He said he shouldn't have to update, which isn't unreasonable, but still not happening without way better testing infrastructure. I would still require modern versions of numpy/scipy, so you might as well upgrade...
That feeling when your bot is better at working on a relationship than you are ;)
I've been there, back when classes were new to me and I would see them scattered about beautifully in some old source code. Now I just use them occasionally, only when needed.
I think it is also wise to check if it is wise to like them. Imagine she puts up a picture of a dead rat or something because she thinks it is disgusting. That is not a good image to like. If she has many followers perhaps it is good to check if anyone else liked it before, or something in that area of control.
I'm not sure what you're arguing for here. I suspect you may have missed the point of my comment. Python 3 undoubtedly has more features and I prefer it, but there's nothing about it that makes it "for professionals" and python2 "for beginners" was my point. Whether a project should or should not upgrade is a different conversation than we are having and depends firmly on the project itself.
 I already use cron to start the script upon boot. What i need is a certain line in the code to print at a specific time, not based on number of seconds as a typical loop argument would run off of. 
Your rule is she is not allowed to tell him she wants him to click like and I said he should talk to her about it and not be dishonest. Communication is key to a good relationship so there is no way I need to revise my advice. :-) 
Red hat derived distros need python for package manager, yum and the new dnf. 
In fairness, &gt; * The most popular machine learning libraries &gt; * Use by thousands of scientists around the world are really just indicative of Python's utility in gluing _other_ things together as opposed to it's strength in building things.
If you want to use less "popular" components you will be stuck with likely only Arduino libraries so - ESP32 in Arduino mode and C - or writing a library for MicroPython or Zerynth. Zerynth is kind of fun and handy to use with it IDE but due to that lack of huge community set of libraries practical usage will be limited. MicroPython also has this problem but smaller as the community is growing. (fragmentation would be the MicroPython threat)
I am currently learning Python! It's been fun so far.
Try this module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schedule
The snippets in your post have different capitalisation. Python is case sensitive so `Main()` is not the same as `main()`. The Python convention is for functions to be lowercase (or snake_case) so to print out text, use the `print()` function; `Print()` isn't defined. I'm not sure about the book but since you are using the print function, it is probably written for Python 3+.
Very cool work. I can see how getting inundated with emails would not be helpful in a focus-sensitive project. All the best!
You *could* have a cron job send a signal to the program at a particular time, and register a callback for that signal -- the [signal](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/signal.html) module in the standard library might help. You can also spawn a thread (or write an otherwise concurrent piece of code) that checks the time at intervals and sleeps in between -- this might be easier.
The technology has me beat. A buddy found this one, I used to remember which bar or club "Dildo Disco" referred to, but don't anymore. When they replace me with a script, I will embrace it, the script never forgets. "Was at the Dildo Disco tonight with Craigslist skanks. Someone was talking about getting a 5 Series, I said make sure you get one that was underwater in New Orleans from a Russian guy on craigslist, fixed up by a nonexistent Los Angeles repair shop. Did you guys see this headline --Girl Guide Registration - Rosswood Valley District (http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/events/Girl-Guide-Registration---Rosswood-Valley-District-100081094.html)... oh my goodness Golf this weekend, surface of the sun, 3am See ya ladies,"
I notice your previous round of comments in this subreddit was *also* trolling. Please find something better to do with your life.
Better not tell Google, Dropbox, and Reddit, amongst others.
&gt; No types, very abstract You don't actually understand what you are talking about. Not remotely.
there is no multi dot operator. there's just a dot operator. single. the question is whether the returned result of that operation `client.list("fruits")` is something that has a `get()` method to call and the result of *that* has a `number()` method to call.
Pls share, I have a serious issue with illustrations I download over the years. 
I'm done with my little search engine for my VI-like DAM application (think picassa but with VI). It can search and sort tagged images with conditions like in SQL, mostly because it uses SQLite. I still need to do tests on a real large set of images to see its performance. Kind of queries you can do: search all pics with a cat and a dog or a rabbit in it, and both being of category animal. animal:cat animal:dog:rabbit search all pics with tag Paris, no matter which category, that are smaller or equals 800x600 Paris width:&lt;=:800 height:&lt;=600 Search all pics of year 2017 but without any tag of category travel file_date:YY:2017 -travel:* And lot of stuffs about dates. Thanks to Templite, I can even integrate python functions. Now I need to work on file systems, so I can even read a compressed zip file.
&gt; Who here was really using Python 3 10 years ago? My guess is not many. i was. only one on the team who was, too. drove the engineers nuts because they were 'pry 2.7.x out of my cold dead hands' types. 
Slowly? :(
Sure, adding one! Thank You!
Script you say? Why not write one in our glorious lord and savior language Python. 
I'm somewhat confused on the down votes here. I personally really enjoy Python, but I know of at least half a dozen developers that *do* find it rather hard to read. There is an issue for many people with white space languages that makes things like Python difficult for them to use. To each their own I suppose. 
Ah yes, java, all the inefficiencies of an interpreted language combined with the cruft of decades of JVM modifications without the benefits of sane garbage collection. Sounds perfect for the corporate environment.
According to several employees I’ve spoken to, Google prefers you don’t interview with Python. Their reasoning is that Python gives too much for free (which I think is silly but they didn’t ask me now did they).
Oh, I see. You interviewed with them (who hasn't?). That's some real insider knowledge. *rolls eyes*
This is the module I tried, but i get an error saying the module is not installed... but terminal says it is installed... 
in the mean time corporate world has a brothel where madam Java has a line in font of her door.... 
Well I want to keep it in the same script because what I don't want is both scripts to try to write to the log file at the same time. This would cause the script to crash. 
Well, Madam Java can keep her line without me. Grandmother C exists, and her daughter, C++ - while up in years - can do the same things that skank can. If you know how to finesse her, she can do them better. If I just want a quick romp? Python is always standing there looking sexy. So you stick with Madam Java, but remember, the only reason she's good to go is because she was prepped by better. Do remember that while she's wiping her face off and you kiss her on the mouth anyway.
I am working on refining my Python skills and in doing so I've seen a post about Rosalind. I've been giving it a try ever since. BioScience was never a strong suit.... http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/
I know it's not quite a talk, but i'd recommend anybody with a PluralSight subscription to check out the "python for system administrators" course by Dr Chris Brown. There's just something about the way he demonstrates using python to accomplish a variety of sysadmin tasks that i found to be thoroughly engaging. Picked up a few things on Linux and general computing too.
It is a great article. Thanks for sharing it. I still find this approach (values vs names) a bit confusing. But it is a valid design choice.
It depends on how you define the OS. Linux distributions are usually made up of packages written in many different languages.
Right? I was under the impression it's always been one of the most popular languages and that its use is growing exponentially.
&gt; You can dismiss that one as a novice programmer, because the only experience they have is the freshest fad. Python is an older language than Java, dude. It's definitely not a fad.
I wish you *were* a troll. The idea that there are programmers like you who espouse such utter nonsense is pretty disconcerting.
Don't you mean GNU/Linux /Stallman

/r/learnpython With your second dataframe: count = df.groupby(['date', 'email']).size() print(count) Now create a function to retrieve your data: def return_count(row, count): try: return count.loc[row['email']].loc[row['date']] except: return -1 # testing the function print(return_count(df.loc[0])) print(return_count(df.loc[2])) # now you can apply the function to every row, using axis=1 and # passing a dictionary for the keywords of the function df['count'] = df.apply(return_count, axis=1, **{'count':count}) 
How do you get python to simulate keys? 
&gt; the return of str("9.4") giving an Error What? &gt;&gt;&gt; str("9.4") '9.4' 
Thanks, but that's not what I want. The result must be a count of all occurrences of email in second dataframe BEFORE the date of first dataframe, so I can get how many purchases the client had at the time of quoting.
PyWin32, PyAutoGUI, and [keyboard](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyboard) are the three I know of and could get to work to some degree. Eventually I got PyWin32 to work simply by getting a new PC. So, very finicky. 
Alright everyone, pack your toys we've got a winner here!
If it's the date, you can just filter the second dataframe by the date (easy as tmp = df2[df2.date &lt;= DATE]), and run the group_by method in the tmp df.
Is there something (humble) that you would like to see exist in the world of computing that doesn't now?

&gt; If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython I disagree. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it isn't a python syntax/semantics problem. It's a software-development-with-python issue, and I even acknowledged that there are multiple non-python ways to resolve it.

I mean, statically typed languages are easier to read for some people. Makes sense to me.
I'll be honest, the sudoku solver is a PITA. The others are fairly simple (with bits of internet research), I promise. Think about the core mechanics, not fancy graphics/interfaces. I bet you could do Hangman right now. List of words, pick one, break that word down into a list of characters, create list of underscores of word length, player guesses, check to see if they're right, if so substitute underscores with that letter and guess again, if not, add letter to failed guesses, move the hangman score up by one and guess again. If hangman score reaches 9, game over. Run the whole thing in text. To fancy it, create a list of strings that shows the hangman at each level and show that as well. &gt;________ &gt;| / | &gt;|/ O &gt;| &gt;| &gt;|___________ The fact that you are curious enough to ask your q means that you are curious enough and smart enough and tenacious enough to do this, to do all of these and more besides.

There will be some kind of terms of service agreement, probably when you create an account you will have to agree to this. There will also be rate limits - so you can't make too many api calls per second and drown the service. Good API's will cover the rules in their documentation.
That's a big leap from upticks in web page traffic to more users. 
thank you good sir
Python is strongly typed.
Just to make that clear to OP since it is a structural change. He wants TWO try blocks: try: try: thing() except ExceptionType as err: handle() raise except OtherExceptionType as err: handle() raise except: logger.critical() Or flip it around and handle all exception types by logging them with an internal logging handler and then reraising them and having the outer handler handle by type: try: try: thing() except: logger.critical() raise except ExceptionType as err: handle() except OtherExceptionType as err: handle() In fact this way around would be a nice for a [decorator pattern](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2016/06/09/python-how-to-create-an-exception-logging-decorator/)
Decorators are frustrating, but they're an advanced skill. If you don't fully understand all the fundamentals then I can see why it would be hard to fully grasp. I didn't fully get decorators until I wrote and rewrote a few pieces of test code. It took a while, but it's not an impossible task for any programmer to learn, it just takes time and practice.
Try the [Xonsh shell](http://xon.sh/) and [Transcrypt](http://www.transcrypt.org/).

What you describe is [Privilege separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation). &gt; How to create a service that has greater permissions than a regular user which I can control more easily. You'll have to rely on your OS there. Run this part of your code in a process with different user permissions than your regular user. So run this as your 'foo' user. (You want to not run it as root/admin however if at all possible.) &gt; A method of authentication to the service that is separate from builtin-OS groups and permissions This will depend on the solution. Which brings me to [Pyro4](http://pyro4.readthedocs.io). You can use it to easily make a client and server part of your program that talk to eachother, and run the server part in the separate process. Authentication can be done however you like (you're free to design the API however you like), but the latest version of Pyro4 allows you to do this via SSL and using client and server certificates if you so desire. 
**Privilege separation** In computer programming and computer security, privilege separation is a technique in which a program is divided into parts which are limited to the specific privileges they require in order to perform a specific task. This is used to mitigate the potential damage of a computer security vulnerability. A common method to implement privilege separation is to have a computer program fork into two processes. The main program drops privileges, and the smaller program keeps privileges in order to perform a certain task. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

You get a refund if your train is late? OMG if Vancouver had that they would go broke. 
By that, I’m assuming you mean GNU in addition to the Linux kernel, correct?
as a C++ dev have you ever used Python as a C++ wrapper? I know that's common among some to make high-performant and simple python libraries.
Hey thanks for this, never heard of Privilege Separation but I will read up on it. I'd like to clarify one point that is very important. I'll also update the original message with it. The user themselves is making the request. So the idea is 1. User logs into the machine 2. They open my tool 3. They do X - where X is reading/writing to a file they don't have permissions to change 4. X gets sent to a service, which validates against the current user 5. If the user has the correct permissions, X runs. If not, X doesn't run (raise an exception or something) From your description, it sounds like Pyro can do that. But just wanted to clarify, just in case we're talking about different things
I put together [a video on decorators](https://youtu.be/FsAPt_9Bf3U) that some people have found useful. Some people complained about the rabbit-hole of videos that are referenced in that tutorial, but the best route to learn decorators is to first fully understand [first-class functions](https://youtu.be/kr0mpwqttM0), then [closures](https://youtu.be/swU3c34d2NQ), then [decorators](https://youtu.be/FsAPt_9Bf3U)... so each tutorial stacks on top of the previous.
Well there was the great IndexError fiasco of '13 that everyone should know about.
I might try this the next time I have to JavaScript. 
/r/restofthefuckingowl
Yes, you will define a class with exactly those operations that you want to allow on your protected resource. You can even cherry pick methods to expose via Pyro if needed. This is what will run as a service and the rest of your code talks to it. Just imagine writing all of this code as you would normally in Python. Then you lift out the class that exposes the limited set of operations allowed on the files, and run that in a Pyro daemon process with the right set of privileges. The rest of the code that talks to it will talk to a proxy instead but otherwise hardly know what happened.
Nah man, that will likely be an order of magnitute slower than pickle even because it's in Python. Pickle at least uses a C extension module
Thanks.
I will be traveling next week and looking for some Python tutorial I can do while in the air. I just installed Python 3.6.2 on my MacBook. I am downloading some videos and tutorials this week. I have some Python skills and I am looking to learn more.
I really like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4 James Powell - So you want to be a Python expert?
Not trying to come off as smug here. But what issue of decorators are people struggling the most with? I come from a very functional background, so the concept of a function taking other functions as input and returning modified new functions isn't all that foreign or complicated to me, but I've only ever taught matlab where that sort of thing isn't part of pensum, so I'm curios what snags people hit when being taught Python.
What sort of extended functionality does that offer over the built-in scheduler on the Roomba? Like mine fires off on Wednesday at 11 AM. Do you schedule it with some additional data? Like the weather forecast or something? ;)

It's like clockwork every September that these threads pop up in /r/python
I agree, it wouldn't be ideal but I thought it might be his only option if he was serializing something (numpy arrays) that couldn't be serialized using messagepack. However, another commenter, /u/lambdaq mentioned [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), which I had never heard of but sounds like it might be the best solution.
Awesome. I was particularly impressed with the idea that, in many cases, it doesn't require you to change the code at all. I haven't finished the tutorials and I'm a bit concerned with how exceptions over remote work (I see that it prints both the original and the remote exception but I have some proprietary needs to consider with that) but overall this looks very promising. If you know/think of anything else please let me know, this is a gem!
&gt; But what issue of decorators are people struggling the most with? I'm sure some people struggle with closures and the core concepts of decorators, although I don't think they are that bad. In my mind the biggest issue with python decorators is that there are multiple kinds. Simple decorators that take no arguments aren't that bad really. You do have to muck around with functool.wraps to try and keep introspection from breaking horribly, but other than that annoyance its not so bad... The problem is when you need to add arguments to your decorators. No longer is your decorator a function that returns a function, its a function that returns a decorator. Additionally it is executed at parse time and not execution time which makes sense, but will definitely catch some people unawares. The motivation for this sudden change is never really explained... it seems like someone wrote the original decorator spec, and then later realized that decorators with arguments had to be completely different... but couldn't go back and fix them.

After a quick read this seems to be what's asked for
They're not that hard. A decorator is a function that does something with another function. They're useful if you want to do the same thing with many different functions. They're just hard to get because, if you've never used them, you can by the grace of god not imagine something you'd want to do with a function, let alone multiple ones - or at least I did. That was until I started using Flask server, which uses decorators intuitively and effectively. Here's an example, so you can get that understanding as well. A quick introduction to Flask: It can be used to create webservers, which is basically a program that takes HTTP requests such as "www.reddit.com" and returns a website. With flask, you "bind" different functions to different websites enpoints, in the example you would route all "/r/" request to a function that returns different subreddits: from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) # Create flask server @app.route("/r/") # Bind "/r/" request to this function def get_subreddit(): return "&lt;h1&gt; I'm a subreddit &lt;/h1&gt; app.run() # Tadda, a running webserver who can serve subreddits See? Is that concept clearer now? If I wanted other routes, e.g. "/user/", I could just create another function and route "/user/" to that, using decorators. Now, how do decorators work? i.e. how do we define them ourselves? The obviously take a function as an argument, and also other arguments such as "/r/". The way this is designed in python is the following way. Seems a bit weird in the beginning, but this has its reasons. Let's say we want to create a decorator that takes a function, prints a string we give as an argument to the decorator, and then returns the function. In short, so we can doo this: @print_first("foo") def print_bar(): print("bar") print_bar() &gt; foo &gt; bar This is defined this way def print_first(_string): def dec(fun): print(_string) fun() return dec That's right, it a function that returns another function that is executed when the decorated function "print_bar" is executed. You can think of decorators like this: If you write @foo("lol") def bar(): pass Everytime bar() is called, it's not "barr()" anymore, it's this: foo("lol")(bar) It executes the return value of foo with the function as an argument. "bar" is then executed within "dec".
Oh thank you! It has been a long time since I saw these videos. Thanks for the corrections. :)
don't listen to the other guy. Reddit doesn't do hashtags (it doesn't serve the purpose of hashtag in twitter, where you can search with hashtags), so it looks a bit "cringy" when you bring twitter/facebook things into Reddit. Your post is fine without them though.
It started out as an automatic system to detect when I wasn't home (calendar, wifi approximity, pyro sensor, door sensor, and stuff like that), but it wasn't reliable enough, so I just switched to a simple calendar subscription. But I get an iMessage 60 minutes before with an emoji and then another message when it starts.
Quite an interesting article! had a whack at this too but i'm a bit new to powershell.. $ourPackageList = (python -m pip list --format=legacy) | out-String; $badPackages = "acqusition","apidev-coop", "bzip", "crypt", "django-server", "pwd", "setup-tools", "telnet", "urlib3", "urllib"; write-host $ourPackageList; forEach ($bad in $badPackages) { if ($ourPackageList -like "*$bad (*") { write-host "$bad detected" ; } } 
I think that most people don't have trouble understanding the concept of decorators and how they generally work. I think that the difficult part is wrapping one's mind around the implementation details of specific ones. Some decorators are very hand-wavy. At least, that's my take on it.
🐱🔨🍆🙅‍♂️
I recently enjoyed "Loop like a native" by Ned Batchelder. I wish every noob watched this 10 times, every time I see `for i in range(len(mylist))` I want to hit people in the face. :/
I think the part of what can be confusing is when you decorate a function that takes arguments, you need a function that take the function itself as a parameter and another function that takes its arguments as a parameter. Following your example: def print_first(_string): def dec(fun): print(_string) fun() return dec @print_first("foo") def print_bar(): print("bar") let's say that we instead want to wrap a function that takes arguments, like so @print_first('hello') def print_word(word): print(word) def print_first(_string): def dec(fun): def handle_args(*args, **kwargs): print(_string) return fun(*args, **kwargs) return handle_args return dec print_word('world') # -&gt; hello\nworld One has to remember to create a function like handle_args, which I know tripped me up a bit when I first started learning the concept.
 @dec def main(): pass alters value of object of type callable (function) so `main = dec(main)` so calling `main()` is calling `dec(main)()` that's all you really need to know, leave it to fundamentals to figure out what to do with params, return values, multiple decorators.
I think smartwatches are mostly Android-based so I'd guess you'd have to go with Java.
Yes. I found Boost.Python to be very effective once I'd figured out how to use it.
So its basically print_first('hello')(print_word)('world') I guess it's a bit cumbersome, but if you memorize this it's ok. It always helps me to think about _why_ they chose this design, which is in this case to make it possible for both the decorator and the decorated function to use any argumenr name or convention there is - this why they separate it in different functions.
Actually a nice video, thanks! 
&gt; @dec &gt; def main(): &gt; pass &gt; &gt; alters value of object of type callable (function) so main = dec(main) &gt; &gt; so calling main() is calling dec(main)() &gt; "Draw some circles." &gt; that's all you really need to know, leave it to fundamentals to figure out what to do with params, return values, multiple decorators. "Draw the rest of the fucking owl." 
using `functools.partial` to overcome this issue makes it all better. I've learned it from my favorite testing framework `slash` for example: `fixture` decorator at https://github.com/getslash/slash/blob/develop/slash/core/fixtures/utils.py
It finally makes sense. I needed this talk, thanks!
"It's a function that returns a function that takes the decorated function as it's argument." This is what people are struggling with.
There are no bugs, only happy little side quests.
Yes it's quite effective. Most of what we do at work is using python around c++
build it yourself, you'll learn a lot!
Took me a while too originally. "It's just syntactic sugar" half the tutorials insist, as if that explains anything.
I'm not exactly brilliant with decorators, and all the different methods to get the docstring and arguments right look really really annoying. Still, it seems like the prevalence of JavaScript should really help programmers understand the concept of a function taking arguments to generate a new function which will then take a function and return a new function, although of course the way variables in closures are handled is a bit more painful in Python. OK, now it makes sense why that's so confounding.
I was already familiar with Lisp macros, so decorators was pretty simple. If you are into computer science, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is a mind-blowing book. And as bonus side-effect, decorators will be almost obvious.
I personally prefer writing my code with a pen and paper, scanning it, and converting that document to a .py file. I personally use Atom. PyCharm isn't too bad either. At the end of the day, choose whatever you're comfortable with.
I agree with this. Would you really trust a random script someone posts on reddit with your PayPal and broker account/password?
`python -m pip list --format=legacy &gt; packages.txt` with open('packages.txt', 'r') as f: for pack in f: if pack.startswith(("acqusition ","apidev-coop ", "bzip ", "crypt ", "django-server ", "pwd ", "setup-tools ", "telnet ", "urlib3 ", "urllib ")): print(pack) Or the beautiful one-liner version: python -m pip list --format=legacy | python -c "import sys; for pack in sys.stdin: if pack.startswith(('acqusition ','apidev-coop ', 'bzip ', 'crypt ', 'django-server ', 'pwd ', 'setup-tools ', 'telnet ', 'urlib3 ', 'urllib ')): print(pack)"
I am currently giving Atom a try. Are there any extensions you would advise I get?...I have heard a lot about PyCharm too..but I will give atom a go
I don't use any, and try to focus more on writing the code as opposed to what the code is written in :)
Subprocess and datetime.now?
For 1), you can send an iMessage via Applescript. You do have to configure Messages to allow it to send texts from your number first. My setup was to make a random selection from a list of messages in Python and send a text message with it at a certain time every day. I ended up using Automator to handle the scheduling, and just had it invoke my Python script via bash. The automator task also invoked the Applescript file. As others have pointed out, you could also run the entire thing from within Python and simply shell out to osascript. As for actually sending the iMessage, here's what I used: **sendMessage.applescript** on run {targetBuddyPhone, targetMessage} tell application "Messages" set targetService to 1st service whose service type = iMessage set targetBuddy to buddy targetBuddyPhone of targetService send targetMessage to targetBuddy end tell end run 
Loool writing code is the most important anyways but a good environment helps 😊
You have won todays Internet. You can collect your Internet points at the cafeteria on the seventh floor.
A good environment helps, but only after getting comfortable or learning a bit. Right now, use something simple like Notepad++, Atom or even pycharm - without autocomplete and linting. This will help you learn. That way, when you have to work in a different environment or another computer, you wouldn't be totally lost. A good enviroment helps, but you should focus on learning the language, and then try and find the IDE that works best for you. Everyone's workflow is different, there are a lot of options for IDEs. There is no "best" or the "right" IDE. It is whichever one you like and are comfortable with. So, give them all a try. Since you are starting, my suggestion is PyCharm.
Find a broker with an api. Open account, deposit funds, use api. Done... Seriously, not how you should approach this. 
It's not that hard. It's just synthetic sugar around a function call, where the decorated function or method is passed as an argument. Usually the decorator returns a function that does some magic with the method or function it was applied to (it is passed as an argument to the decorator), and returns it. But it can return anything you like. 
The ref to `main` is implicity passed as the first parameter to `dec`. From there you would need `dec` to return a ref to a function so that calling `dec(main)()` aka `main()` makes sense. It's probably best to play around with it in IDLE to learn. Just trying to give a minimal example. There's plenty more ways to make things tricky.
I imagine it's to avoid naming conflicts between variables in higher scopes. For example, if your decorator takes a variable called `n` and the function you're decorating also takes a variable called `n`
correct, that is what i said
Wow thanks very much guys! and thanks for insight with regards to me not depending on autocomplete from the start. I really appreciate this 
I would have to blur the whole thing LOL. It's not pretty, since I am technically an ad guy and the reports are for my own consumption. Basically though, I just put up a flask app with the default theme for foundation 6 on the front. A lot of tables get populated by some javascript library I found that turns ajax requests into searchable, sortable tables. I have a few ugly buttons I can push if I want different data from the Analytics, adwords or magento apis. There's some graphs with spend vs sales per region, per product type, per campaign type (text, shopping, remarketing) There's scripts running every night to pull all kinds of comparison data. I especially focus on recent 7 days vs previous 7 and 28 Vs 28. It identifies big changes in impression share, cpc, bunch of other stuff and gives me lists of things I might want to change and lets me know how ad copy split testing is looking. I still do a lot of the actual changes by calling functions from command line.
Because decorators are nothing more than a callable taking another callable as its only arg and returning a callable. There is some syntax sugar with decorator syntax. And some helpers in stdlib.functools. That's it. If you don't understand other aspects of Python, such as what's a callable, namespaces, scope, difference between run time and "definition" time then youre fucked. But those concepts are not "decorators", just often used with decorators. Btw it's easier to first learn without @syntax sugar. It makes it very clear that they are nothing special just a callable. And makes what's going on with @decorator() "factories" clear.
Interestingly enough, your poor man's dark sky is how (now accuweather's) minutecast was originally implemented IIRC. The guy who made it wasn't a meteorologist and did pretty much the same thing you're doing.
I found your videos last week when I was learning about decorators and they're fantastic! So clear and well-explained. Thank you!
