scikit-learn would be another one, brought me close to desperation once.
Man I really want to replace a bunch of my old excel vba scripts at work with python, no better time than now 
You're wanting to find all spans in the source code that have no other attributes? Or are you looking for a specific one?
Automate the boring stuff with Python https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
Recently i discovered that counting numbers in Python takes much more longer than JS. It was a shocking moment for me because i always thought python is so much better than other scripting languages. It was like 122 seconds on Python and 0,6 seconds on JS. I'm not sure and don't know things like that but default JIT or easier to use gpu would be awesome
Does that show how to do all of the graphic stuff as well?
I would love this. Honestly, knowing something cannot be mutated later is great for peace of mind with design. Of course, it goes against one of my favourite things, which is duck punching when a lib author can't be bothered to fix something/I need behaviour they don't want to give me. I'm torn. 
I listen to the Python bytes podcast.

That's old news though: https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html &gt; Update: After this post was originally written back in 2014, subsequent discussions on the core python-dev mailing list led to the conclusion that the release after 3.9 will probably just be 3.10. However, a 4.0 will presumably still happen some day, and the premise of this article is expected to hold for that release: it will be held to the same backwards compatibility obligations as a Python 3.X to 3.X+1 update.
&gt; If you aren't working in datascience you use numpy exactly 0 times. _This is so untrue._ It is incredibly useful _any time_ you use an array-like data structure, due to its expressive power it has and all the code it saves (not even to mention the performance boost). Nearly every for loop manipulating arrays or numeric values can be replaced with a single numpy statement that is clearer and just "does what it says." For example I've used numpy for programming abstract board games. Board state as a WxHxC array, giving me all of numpy's indexing/filtering power when manipulating board state, and even allows me to handle or update many game states "in parallel" in search scenarios. All of this translates to incredibly intuitive nearly _declarative_ code. I've used numpy for graphics, for network graphs, for manipulating logs and performance data, just tons of commonplace things that isn't just for someone who would call themselves a "data scientist." It is a _terrible shame_ that it's just viewed as a "data science library," when it opens up Python to a beautiful style which I find complements the functional style excellently. It is the first library I import in a new project if I know I am going to manipulate numbers or arrays *at all*.
Okay, what about: How is Flask not in the standard library? There are millions working in web dev. It's easy to think youre in the majority if you never look outside your profession.
No. But this is a very well written book to prepare you for the more advanced topics like GUI. You need this book one way or another. 
Maybe have a look at [supervisord](http://supervisord.org). I believe it's quite commonly used to manage Django deployments and the like.
same goes for PIL (Pillow)
While this is a very cool project, the reality is that if you find yourself needing to use Python (or VBA!) in Excel, you probably aren’t using the right tool for the job. 
https://www.amazon.ca/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036
That's my go-to as well.
sentdex is so good it's overwhelming.
And the beginning was, what, in 1989? Or are we talking about a more recent adjustment of the guiding language goals? Things change. It's fine, really. You don't have to sacrifice single-threaded performance (to an easily-measured degree, anyhow) to use a GC while dropping the GIL; at best, the GIL smooths out latency variation you would normally see from GIL and other locking behavior. At worst, by permeating interactions with the rest of the running program, it makes infeasible various code analysis that could enable optimization analysis and further acceleration of the workloads.
From deprecation warnings.
I think you need to go step by step. You have to learn the basics first, making scripts usefuls to you in your life. And then jump to create packages, libraries and programs. This is my advice, start doing something useful to you, otherwise is boring.
aah but I remeber when the package was also called PIL... now _get off my lawn!_
&gt; Well, let me start first by stating that a decent editor shouldn't have a problem opening a file of any size. If you are struggling / don't have a way to do that, you failed at making an editor. That's ridiculous. Pycharm is an IDE and a bit more complex than vim. It is meant for writing code, not opening and editing files with thousands of lines. If you need to do that, simply use an appropriate tool (less, sed). Assuming 25bytes per line, 2.4Mb is equivalent to 100k lines. Btw, try opening a huge file with \`:syntax on\` in vim.
I'm not a BS user but from the docs it seems that `attrs` is expecting a dictionary, not a set. So what if you pass `attrs=dict()` to `find_all`? 
 def span_no_attrs(tag): return tag.name == "span" and len(tag.attrs) == 0 soup.find_all(span_no_attrs) That's one way.
import requests r = requests.get(‘url’) if “string” in r.text
I listen to [Podcast._init__](https://www.podcastinit.com/)
All I want is getting rid of the GIL. I know there are a lot of users that don't care, but I constantly run into cases where multiprocessing just isn't enough.
Technically PIL still exists, Pillow is a fork which kept the name for compatibility. Also PIL let you import the submodules directly which was really weird (e.g. you'd import Image instead of PIL.Image).
Solution: use lxml, the package &amp; module have the same name.
Studying Python! I have been a programmer for the longest time with experience in Java, DB’s, and Smalltalk but it’s only now that I’m studying Python. I’m intrigued with all that I’m reading and I cant wait to create my first Python code

The python documentation is good if you don't mind destroying your eyes with a monitor display. 
Version numbers aren't decimals, though.
I'd love pattern matching in Python. But I'd also like a proper switch statement.

&gt;if 'string' in r.text &gt; &gt;\^ &gt; &gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax Thank you! This is the error I keep getting. Any thoughts?
I recommend download a PDF cheat sheet, work through the examples for a day, then do excercises on codingbat, then start a simple game from your head, don't follow any guide or you won't learn how to solve problems.
Put the whole script in a pastebin, like paste.ubuntu.com. Send over the link. 
This seems smoother. Always like functions that have error management built in. Have seem so many codes that break because some variable length is 0. After 90% of work, code break. Uggg. 
The problem is probably that shipping Python Scripts or Jupyter Notebooks to coworkers without much programming experience is not such a great idea. Everyone can open Excel sheets.
Ah well, too bad.
Since I crossposted, I can't modify the text, but to give it a little more Python focus: It all started when I wanted to have a summary of the A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF, also colloquially known as 'Game of Thrones' due to the success of the TV series) books, since I don't have much time to read them again, and I knew [A Wiki of Ice and Fire](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php) had some good summaries. So I thought about collecting them in a book. I immediately thought about doing it in Python since that was the language I felt the most comfortable with. I'm still not sure if this is an optimal choice, but it works so I'm fine with it. The goal is simple: 1. Download the content from the Wiki 2. Parse it 3. Make an eBook out of it 4. Convert it to other formats 5. Automate it Step 1 is easy, it's a `wget`. I tried to use other libraries, but `wget` was the most efficient in collecting these files somehow, but maybe some pure Python equivalent is possible. Step 2 is the hard one. One could think a `BeautifulSoup` is an easy solution, and that's what I thought at first, but for many reasons, even tweaking it a lot didn't make it work: broken hyperlinks, broken Unicode, things not going exactly where I wanted, etc. and a lot of other joys. So I had to do it the rough way, just using regex. And it worked, thanks `re`. It's shaky at best because if they change their structure (and they did recently), you have to fiddle with the parser again, but hey it works perfectly for now! For step 3, I found [Pypub](https://github.com/wcember/pypub) which is a library to make an ePub from HTML files. Unfortunately it is in Python 2 and doesn't seem to be maintained anymore (and their are some limitations), but I modified it just a little bit of it for my case, and after many adjustments, it worked! I had my ePub. For step 4, I have to use an external library, because nothing seems to exist in the Python world, but fortunately [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) exists, and so I call it externally through its command line `ebook-convert`. Finally for step 5, I could have done it in Python with `subprocess`, since I have to call Python 2 within Python 3, along with calling Calibre, so I made a batch file. It's for Windows only so far, but since it's literally 10 lines of code almost directly transferable to shell, it should be easy to port on Linux, I just didn't have time to start a VM with a distrib on it to test it. That's the story. It's beginner level Python code, but I learnt a lot doing it, notably on regex, and on objects, since I modified Pypub, so I had to look at how classes and objects were implemented etc. The code is shaky at best as I said, but it works. If you want to improve it, feel free to submit a PR, fork it or whatever else you want! And enjoy the books too :)
Good to know, the last time I was using Twisted was in 2011-2012, basically to spawn tcp/udp listeners.

If I recall, python nerds to be installed on the system to use xlwings. If your coworkers already have a python environment, it's really not much different to just send them a script. 
Anything in the standard library becomes essentially frozen due to backward compatibility guarantees (numpy moves _relatively_ fast). Ideally, a standard library should only contain a _very_ small core of features and "basics" and the rest should be provided externally, where faster moving projects can improve and thrive.
I like this nonsense about "other implementations". Really. Other implementations don't exist, they are joke / proof-of-concept projects. PyPy maybe the most "serious" of them. Even so, if they find that they do something unlike CPython does, then they try to correct towards all the undocumented features, including bugs that exist in CPython. Python is a very complex language, so, if an absolutely new programmer wanted to properly implement it, it would have been easier to implement C compiler, and then compile CPython on that, rather than trying to replicate this convoluted clusterfuck of nonsense. The "alternative implementations" exist, because they started off when Python was simpler, and they could afford to implement changes incrementally. But, if Python will keep adding retarded features with every new dot release, the alternatives will not be able to keep up, and will eventually die off... as if they were ever relevant.
And how is your experience with Quart?
&gt; At some point, every editor will break down. As pointed out earlier, that's bullshit. If a filesystem says that the maximum file size is X, the editor should be able to open a file of size X. If it doesn't, then it's garbage. There's no requirement that an editor open such files with all features enabled because, obviously, some are simply impossible for files of such size, not due to bad design, but due to physical limitations. But, the garbage that PyCharm is is a complete failure if it can only handle tiny files. Just to put this in perspective: most PDFs I have that are basically, just few pages articles published in some journal are bigger than that. My not-so-new cellphone's camera takes images which are about ten times the limit. This limit only indicates how bad the programmers are those who created this editor.
1. Why do you have to open a new terminal window? Can't you just run the same command again? (arrow up) 2. You can connect to you PI from your computer and both update and run the code from your computer on the PI. Look into https://winscp.net/eng/download.php 3. GUI's can be quirky and hard to work with. You could look into running it as a webapp. For that I would recomend you re write your code into either a Flask or Django app. Both are well documented python webapp libraries.
Using pypy is less weird than testing integers with `id` instead of `==`? Pypy try to match documented behavior where they can, but this behavior is defined as implementation specific. Will this behavior work with python 4? Pyrhon 3 on a new platform?
In proper Pythonic humour I would suggest renaming the `filtered` list to `sieved`, since we are working with (beautiful) soup after all.
But you're already using Python ;)
Use r/learnpython for questions. Today I'm feeling helpful... import json with open('data.json') as f: data = json.load(f) for x in data['results']: for y in x['vehicle']['make_model']: print(y['name']) print(y['confidence']) 
Did you compare it to PyPy?
all of them
try \`data\['results'\]\[0\]\['vehicle'\]\['make\_model'\]\` and pressing enter

Your IDE paragraph reminds me of that GNU+Linux meme, so I'm not going to comment on that. It is an IDE for all intents and purposes. &gt; My not-so-new cellphone's camera takes images which are about ten times the limit. I didn't realise you're planning to open image files in a python IDE. Each to their own. I assume the Pycharm developers had real-world applications in mind. 2.44Mb equals about 100k lines of code. Please show me one real example of python code more than 100k lines in a single file. Sure, you can make a Pycharm-like program capable of opening big files. 99.99% of your users won't care or even notice.
Thanks for the answers guys!
Any particular you can recommend?
You can share folder over network, so you don't have to copy any files. For example using Samba https://www.samba.org/ You can establish SSH terminal connection to Pi and restart application there. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/ You can use VNC (remote desktop) to connect to Pi. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md

Thanks so much it works perfectly!!!! I'll post in r/learnpython next time.
Answer according to your title: https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9780988432833/9780988432833___4.htm
Thanks for your comments. I will try the suggestions. 
1. have two terminals on your main PC: 1 for your PC and one that is connected to the Pi via remote ssh to run things. 1. Git and github would be the simplest solution. just `git clone http://somegithubproject.com`, after that you just use `git commit`, 'git push', and `git pull` to keep things up to date in both areas. 1. GUI, no matter what you learn, is going to be somewhat difficult. GUI is just not a simple thing at all. You can look at Zetcode's[ PyQT5 guide](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/) for guidance. You need to know OOP to use most any UI framework. 
Thanks for your suggestions. I will try them. I plan to try python dict to store the emails and update count, etc. and only dump to database once in a while. Hope that will increase performance. 
&gt;I'd welcome it if someone did another experiment along the lines of Greg's patch (which I haven't found online), and **I'd welcome a set of patches into Py3k only if the performance for a single-threaded program (and for a multi-threaded but I/O-bound program) does not decrease.** [https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235) From the benevolent dictator himself.

About a month ago, I debuted a project of mine, [ezpq](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq), which provides a parallel queueing system, powered by either `multiprocessing.Process` or `threading.Thread`. It will also produce a visualization of the queue operations. The feedback I received was very useful and led to v0.2.0. This update includes: * Synchronous "lanes" that allow ensure dependent jobs are executed in sequence. * Integration with [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), for progress bars. * Addition of a `map()` function. * Plot enhancements. * Unit tests. Get it on pip! ```python pip install ezpq ``` Check out the repo and readme: [https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq) And the notebook of examples: [https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq/blob/master/docs/examples.ipynb](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq/blob/master/docs/examples.ipynb) At this point, `ezpq` does everything I need it to do. I plan to maintain it over the years, but future features may be sparse. That said, I am eager to hear your feedback, and PRs are welcome!
...what.
U dnt knw how to create instagram API
1. /r/learnpython 2. `pip install biopython`.
Is this a shitpost? What do you mean by "create Instagram API"? What are you trying to _do_?
this is good. Can you somehow go back in the archive ? last week and before ? &amp;#x200B;
I want to knw the source code to create a instagram API
OK, I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe you're not shitposting.
In Python we can create instagram API . In which you can like comment on a public account just by Python bot
Start [here](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
Means?
Bt there is no instagram API
Read the book and you will understand.
Ok bt I need just a source code I have to see that code please
No one will give you source code for free. Pay someone to work for you, or read a book and learn.
This is not something someone can just tell you. It will take hours and hours of training. And I don't think you have worded your question correctly, because to be able to create a instagram API, you would have to have access to instagram's servers. 
[Here](https://github.com/Damply/DampMovieBot/tree/master) is the github link to the source code. Updating the readme with some helpful information to get started.
I like the following: - [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/) - [PyCoders Weekly](https://pycoders.com/) - [Planet Python](https://planetpython.org/) - a Python blog aggregator Reddit has this channel which is pretty good for news too. I write on my [blog](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/) and on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/), so you might want to check those out as well.
Ok I will try and if I got the code then I wil publish here so that no one has to pay
Do your own homework.
Lol if someone ask you for help then how can u say him to do it urself
It's something like u have to instagram developer mode and then copy the code 
You are not asking for help, you want the whole thing, someone already gave you help and you don't understand.
I got that bt I need proper guidance
[r/PythonNews](https://www.reddit.com/r/pythonnews)
Yeah if I had to do 1 for each visit my arms would be unable to write code anymore. 
Instagram has an API: https://www.instagram.com/developer/
Shitposting is posting large amounts of content of "aggressively, ironically, and trollishly poor quality" to an online forum or social network, in some cases intended to derail discussions or otherwise make the site unusable to its regular visitors.
Twelve years ago. And he's no longer BDFL. Requirements change. Use cases change. History doesn't matter as much as the present. For Py3, it was sanitizing string processing. For Py4, it could be any number of things. Cleaning up concurrency is a good step. Cleaning up concurrency _will_ represent a breaking change to the language, as people today engage in behaviors that depend on the GIL in subtle ways. But, really, it doesn't matter until someone writes the code, and it doesn't look like anyone's going to do that just yet.
One of the benefits of Python is also one of the reasons why writing the perfect book for it is hard: It can be used to do so many things that, once you get the basics down, you're have a ton of directions you can go in. Now, I wrote a book that tried to do this (Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours), but even with that, I had to tell the reader that call I could do was get them started on building a website / game / etc. I've also seen books that try to teach Python through the lens of a specific kind of application development, but the end results sometimes lean towards being too light on both the basics *and* the framework. Personally, I'd suggest learning the basics of Python and then finding a book in the framework that interests you. 
What if I want “clouded”, which is neither cloudless nor full on cloud?
As far as I know Planet Python doesn't provide an archive other than the RSS feed. Or you can scroll the site as far down as it gets.
I’m self teaching myself to write a GUI in tkinter. It will play clips of audio when you click a button. It’s for my old high school baseball team so they can play walk up songs for each hitter.

The reality is that "you probably aren't using the right tool for the job" is a completely asinine statement in the business world and isn't worth repeating no matter how true it is. We use so many spreadsheets with macros at work, all written by the CEO. It's the tool he knows and I don't think he'd ever relinquish control over stuff like that. He's not going to learn a real programming language and he's not going to hire anyone to write bespoke software, so all of our "software" is spreadsheets full of buttons that run macros. I feel like rewriting all my macros in python just to be an asshole.
I don't understand all the comments that talk about utilising the GPU in Python. The GPU is essentially a CPU with immense SIMD capabilities which can do single precision floating point arrithmetic fast. Not really what most people use Python for... Python doesn't even have single precision floats. And a GPU isn't even fast once we introduce conditionals. Native GPU is not going to happen in Python and we should not wish for it either. GPU NumPy, maybe, but Python? Never.
If you set up your environment to do that, that’s on you. I’d assume your python 3 doesn’t point to 3.0.

So far so good. I haven't done any significant load testing on it, so I'd have to get back to you on that. No real pains so far, but I don't use many extensions. Making views Async is pretty easy to do. The dev is responsive to issues and PRs. I used it initially for http2 support. In prod I notice some 504s on the ALB in-front of it, but it's less than 0.5% of all requests... I'm yet to investigate as it's not a problem for my use case.
The GIL is staying. It’s a waste of time complaining about it. Go help on the GILectomy if you really want it.
I just released a project I've been working on for over 6 months now. [ezpq](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq) makes it easy to parallelize your exiseting code. It is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq) and PIP (`pip install ezpq`)! This is my first public Python project and I'm eager for the community to tear it apart (or perhaps get some use out of it).
pyquery is still not a front end/javascript replacement. It brings jQuery's syntax to the back end for people who are comfortable with jQuery and uncomfortable with python. Your best bet is to ignore it, because it's whole purpose is to be able to write jQuery-like syntax in python.

It depends how you define a parallel process. Multithread is very different than multicore. Multicore makes a copy of the objects using pickle, but is fully parallel. Multithread is limited by the GIL. You can also use async, which is parallel, but for I/O.

I threw together a Django (1.8, sadly) template tag that mimics the built-in `include` tag, in order to process Markdown files using `python-Markdown` as though they were standard templates. Overall goal being I wanted to write some long-form documentation into the code base and have it accessible to end users within modals on the site, and I figured keeping the raw Markdown files would be more maintainable long-term. That was Friday, anyway. Yesterday was all meetings, so today I'm just finishing up my Markdown documentation which documents the new process for writing new documentation in Markdown (yo dawg). And for the rest of the week I'll be busy writing said documentation.
Python is way better but I'm not sure the array example is the best example of only one way to do it.

working on my first game and project in python using pyxel library: &amp;#x200B; [in this repo](https://github.com/comatan96/CorgiGame) right now im leraning for my exams so ill get back to it when done :)
Objects.
;) a1 = ["a","b","c"] a2 = [];a2.append("a");a2.append("b");a2.append("c") d = {"a":"","b":"","c":""};a3 = d.keys() a4 = list("abc") a5 = [s for s in "dfgahjkllhjkn;bsdfg43809gcsdfgf" if s in "abc"] eval(compile("a6 = ['a','b','c']", '&lt;string&gt;', 'exec'))
Isn't list() the only one in the standard library though? I I think including libraries is kind of cheating. Still though, if I want a list in Python I just type list(). In C I have to decide between malloc() or declaring it locally. For 2d, You also have to decide whether you want the whole array to be contiguous or you want an array of pointers to subarrays.
I had a lot of fun making an initiative/hp tracker. It has she nice UI too
Hey can this basically be dropped in to the middle of a class and I should expect all to go well? I have something that is using threading which just calls a function to thread that does a bunch of IO and web scraping work. So, simple replace thread.start_new_thread with your function - Has it been tested enough for that to likely work?
Probably not. I doubt most of those people even know semver exists.
Been doing C for embedded systems for few years, now trying Python.. Currently making automatic Instagram engagement bot - using python to join Telegram groups, getting Instagram links, then liking them and posting my own to get engagement. Alongside making simple GUI with PySimpleGUI - QT. Struggling to make .exe with pyinstaller which is annoying.
Couple of projects, which is usually how I keep myself from being overwhelmed with one project 1) Webscraping skiplagged.com to easily pick out flights so I don't have to keep putting in the same information and checking a website everyday 2) Doing a simple calculation for a lab I work in which would keep me from having to use excel for this set of calculations every week 3) Starting to work with Kivy and understanding the idea behind app building 
I'm working on finishing and publishing my first (public) discord bot! 
I'm *always* in need of help, haha. Python is not my first language, and I was motivated to make ezpq as "pythonic" as possible, despite not knowing what that was. Anyway, if you care to scour the code for anything that may be off-putting to Python veterans, or if you have any other improvements to suggest, I am open to PRs!
Currently holding a Kivy Hackathon before the FOSDEM in Brussels. We'll work on Kivy and Python for Android, iOS, and more. First we meet, then we code! And I've bring some modular music gears to show how we can make music with spaghetti (jack cable)and thinking sort of same as coding. 
Writing a set of python modules for making UI on windows, because I don't like Tkinter, and Qt is cool but I wanted to tackle making my own.
Just finished creating a discord bot for my friends that allows us to vote from a list of games and displays the results with matlibplot to determine the game that we will play for our weekly gamenight. Now moved on to unity as I just recently got VR and creating models and seeing your work in VR is freaking SWEET
Nice list of news and info sources from the hitchhiker's guide to python: &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/news/](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/news/)
I finally decided to start the #100daysofcode. Wish me luck and patience!
I set up something fast where I work: a BI using Microsoft's Power BI and Excel sheets for our weekly meetings. Multiple types of data and origins: sales figures to amount of material wasted. I said it was temporary (and it'll be because I hate how it works) and I'm planning to switch to a server-based BI using Django(?) and MySQL. I tried 3 times to start this thing but I always find Django kinda weird: if I must know Javascript and HTML to mess with Django (Python), it wouldn't be easier to scrap Python entirely and learn Javascript and go with it? At the moment I'm creating some scripts that will scan the Excel files in the company network, look for the last data entry and store in a JSON. In a few weeks I'll take charge of another area and will have less time to deal with the data and check if it's being updated, so I'll create reports for each Excel file to auto-send to my staff.

Python is flexibly diverse. Non-forceful object oriented. Functional, Imperative, Object-orientated and procedural.
Python is block structured. Apart from that I don't know what you're asking. Can you be more specific? If you're asking what I think you're asking, you might want to try /r/compsci.
Picking a project back up that I took to about 90% completion back in the fall. It's a library to interface with the Elektron Digitone, a synthesizer groove box. There is currently no real sysex support for the box so I reverse engineered their sysex. Now I just need to implement their coding scheme and pickle my dictionaries.
trying to work through pygame by making a galaga clone... at the moment trying to understand the finer points of the game loop :( - pain... very much pain.
Building a tool to scrape 13F filings from EDGAR (I know tools already exist but I want to learn about web scraping myself)&gt;
After many years, I just published my first package on pypi! [JSOM](https://github.com/slavfox/jsom) is a parser for broken object notation that isn't valid JSON, but close enough to still be parseable. I had to process some data that was so dirty that dirty-json couldn't handle it, and decided to upload it to pypi. It was much easier and smoother than I expected! 10/10 would write packages again
If you are already parallelizing your code with threads/processes, implementing ezpq will require few modifications to existing code. I have been using ezpq for my needs with success, and this new version includes a few unit tests to ensure what goes in also comes out in the expected order. Of course, each scenario can introduce new variables, so you'd be doing me a favor by evaluating this in your existing code and letting me know how it goes.
Building a model that decomposes ad media spend data into channel and creative components so that they can be evaluated independently for performance and cost optimization. 
I think my problem stems from if I split up the code too much, the inter dependencies kill me. I import file a with dependencies file b and it errors so I import file b first but there's dependencies on file a. :( I realize there prob is a better way but being new I have no idea what it is. :( I tried just using namespaces or putting an __inti__ in the folder with the other file but that doesn't work (using 3.7). The namespace doesn't work unless I've imported it, see above. Like I said, I'm sure there's another way, but I haven't run across it yet. The pains of a newb :P 
You are looking for a for loop. 
Libraries are somewhat cheating, but Python basically has numpy and pandas as standard libraries. They're required to do things that Matlab and R can do natively. 
Budgetting program. First big project for me. It’s ridiculous that you need to give others access to your accounts in order to track this kind of stuff. But, It’s killing me. Having a ton of mysql issues, as it’s my first time using it. Plus, my macbook is too old for the newer versions of most things(late 2008). May just try and use csv’s to keep my values. Adapt and overcome, right?!
Working on getting this guy release-worthy: https://github.com/pbromwelljr/gnewcash Python library to assist with reading, manipulating, and writing to GnuCash files. Full docs included in Pages link. Need to finish integrating it with my existing finance code (my personal stuff) and iron out bugs I find through that integration. And I need to update the README on how to get contributors environment set up.
It may be easier to make a guy in html css etc there is modules for it on python
I’m working on being a total beginner. I finished my first mini program between tasks at work and I’m pretty happy with the results. The program rolls 2 dice independently and sums them up to make sure the probabilities of rolling 4,5,6... stay true vs. a random number 2-12. From there it counts the occurrences of each roll total and returns a little table. Now this may seem dumb to most people, but I’m proud of myself because I didn’t copy paste anything. I looked up how everything worked and tried to actually learn what exactly I was doing. Another goal was to use as many loops as I could to keep the code as short as possible. Success. Hopefully next week I’ve got something even better. 
First programming language, started learning python just a week ago. Still learning the basics. Don't understand 99% of the terms being used here and other similar forums. 🤷‍♂️
I agree, but if I'm not looking to do linear algebra I'm just going to use a regular list. 
Honestly, using IronPython would be the better move in my opinion. You get full access to the .Net Framework and complete integration with COM+ to get 100% coverage for programmatically access Excel (and other Office APIs). It's currently frozen at Python 2.7 compatibility, but that should be fine for most business use until IronPython 3 comes out.
Working on someone else’s Django project which has a production Postgres database but zero migrations. Like the original developer didn’t know they existed. Sigh... what’s the best way to add them in after the fact?

"Coding and algorithms"
Looks good! It seems like more of a job scheduler than purely a queue mechanism - nothing wrong with that, but those are the words you'd need to compare it to other libraries. One thing I find often lacks in queue-handling libraries is being able to iterate through the jobs while there are some still being processed. Maybe a `drain` method which yields things as they become available rather than sticking them into a list? I have flipped between a number of job schedulers myself and none have the killer feature I need - one-time setup for a worker node which can then process lots of tasks. I have a ProcessorObject which takes a long time to instantiate, but once it has been instantiated, it holds no state between tasks so it can be re-used. I don't want to instantiate a new ProcessorObject for every item in the queue (thousands), just once for every worker (dozens).
Wait so are you trying to run the code, because for that you need a py file
Oh my… I feared you and I realized the same project, but in the end not at all. Everything is fine :P Indeed I just developed a kind of sequencer which can run some functions in parallel. But the whole point is to have python functions in some files, and sequence descriptions in some other files written in YAML. It is named [yapyseq](https://github.com/RomainTT/yapyseq) :) Nice work of yours! Very useful in Jupyter notebooks indeed ! I didn’t read the whole doc but can you tell me if it behaves well with the Jupyter kernel ? I always wondered if the use of multiprocessing would trouble the interface with the notebook. For instance, if you create a chart in each job, does it work ? &amp;#x200B;
Currently playing around with Pygame, trying to make an SCP-style escape the room game
I tried to learn Python using several of the online offerings but didn't have much luck. I decided to pick up Python Crash Course &lt;https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse&gt; and had a really good experience going through the book, learned a lot. It teaches Python as if you are a complete beginner and also has projects built into the material. It's not free but if you're willing to spend some money, I'd go with Python Crash Course. 
It may sound silly but I learned by using teaching blogs for the basics- how to load data etc. Then just googled the specific questions I had that would stump me. Seems that everything I asked or needed to know has already been asked before by someone on stackoverflow. Amazing resource for all python related questions. 
[removed]
&lt;Def myfile.read&gt; might be needed 
I start my trek to a CS degree in March and I’ve made it a goal for myself to finish the Python Crash-course before starting. It’s been about 3-4 days since I started and I’m about halfway done. Good progress! 
Yea that's what I've been relying on as well, and it's been working so far. But I would really like to understand the fundamentals of how it works too. 
You tried to make a point and you ended up just ripping on your company and strengthening that point I get it. 3 months ago my boss decreed we’d upgrade to python 3. Nothing has happened since. Whatever, our official version of Python is 2.7.8, but some of our systems run 2.6.6, which is wildly different. Our numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc. versions are from that time as well to make it easier to develop robust software. I long ago stopped listening and oh shit, my code works on modern versions and old versions instead of only old versions.
We have a new naming convention coming in at work (in house creative dept for a big UK based but international brand), so I’ve been learning Python to automate renaming and filing existing files, duplicating templates and other stuff that will no doubt be requested once people realise it’s possible. I’m a web dev but this is the first time I’ve properly dug into python. Loving it so far. 
I appreciate the feedback! There's definitely more queueing than scheduling going inside. Users who are familiar with the standard queue methods `put()`, `get()`, etc. should feel familiar with ezpq queue methods. To address your first need, using the `get()`, you can retrieve completed item(s) while others are still being worked. I'm unsure if ezpq can address your second need. Under-the-hood there really are no "workers", just spawned threads/processes. The number of "workers" is really just a limit on the number of concurrent operations. You can delegate/split work to these spawned instances however you'd like.
Not python related, but my portfolio site. Next I'll be working on a python app for work that connects and pulls data from access. This is similar to something that I made before. But I'm gonna make it larger and give it a gui.
With async it's cooperative and limited to a single CPU core. If you need to do anything remotely CPU bound async will not cut it. Multiprocessing doesn't work once you have non-trivial share-memory data structures because you just end up in pickling hell.
Can you use sqlite3 instead of CSV files?
Awesome name
Are you trying to figure out where to start or are you having trouble getting code that you’ve written go work?
&gt; You tried to make a point and you ended up just ripping on your company and strengthening that point I think it may have came across as snide, didn't mean for that. I am just tired of always reading the same things over and over. Someone will be asking for help on stackoverflow or whatever, basic question, someone will ask "What are you trying to achieve?" and then the OP will try and explain it and they'll be met with criticism "that's not the right way to do it ugh" and then they'll say they have no choice, and then they'll get told to find a new job. I mean, VBA is in Excel to be used and it will be used. It may not be the right tool for the job for a programmer but for people like my boss it's great. Try telling everyone on the excel forums of the VBA forums they're using the wrong tool, they will just tell you to fuck off and rightly so in my opinion.
Teach yourself well enough and you will want a refund for your degree.
Nice work on yapyseq! ezpq works great in Jupyter notebooks and makes use of graphical tqdm progress bars in a notebook (compared to text-based progress bars in a console). I wrote up several examples in an existing Jupyter notebook, [here](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq/blob/master/docs/examples.ipynb), though you'll need to run it live to see progress bars.

Got a public repo? This is right up ky alley.
That’s when you should use C++. It’s way faster and a it’s a whole lot easier to write a few functions than an entire program in C.
You should probably not do this in the template. Look at input_fields.py instead. If it's not much work I will add it in next release.
Just finished creating a timer based on the Pomodoro Technique. I have shared it on github. Here's the [link](https://github.com/NektariosMar/PomoClock). Suggestions are welcome!
Try cloc instead. Great way to check lines of code by file type.
Sure! I still have more ideas than functional program, but I have built several parts of it to experiment with. Accept user input through a Django site, or tkinter window, and ask for common things such as bill name, amount, day of month that this bill occurs on/purchase was made, and maybe something that allows you to track them via a “tag” for long term trend tracking. Allow user to pick how they want to plot their data, be it line graphs, pie charts, etc in matplotlib, and display them as such. Allow for tracking of trends via the “tag” associated with it. So groceries in january vs february. Allow for trends to be displayed(such as, if it is february, and you want to plot “march” based on February spending, it will show your expected account balance at the end of march). Lots more ideas, but I don’t have my notes in front of me. As far as current problems, I can’t get the mysqlconnector to communicate to the database. The rest of the problems are just tying it all together. 
I shared your frustration! I hope ezpq serves you well.
Spending my days this week stitching a Google Sheets front-end (Sheets API) to a labor management backend via Excel upload (xlwings) for my hotel. Unfortunately the final .xls report I pull from the labor management web client is not responding to any codec I throw at it, so my work is halted until I can figure out how to decode an ancient Excel workbook with Python. Any thoughts? I’m losing hair over here.
Making a tool that will detect when a satellite is crossing the south Atlantic anomaly (area of elevated radiation), using point-in-polygon algorithm, and inputs of satellite trajectory and a static file containing a polygon approximation of the area of interest
Yep which just highlights my point, nothing brought up in this post matters. There certainly is nothing there to justify 4.0. More importantly I’m currently dealing with a bug in Pythons print() statement. This is in a real simple piece of code too. Actually it appears to be more than one bug. Sadly I’ve written code that does basically the same thing in C++ without failure. In any event there seems to be a fundamental problem with Python development at the moment where new features are preferred over fixing existing code. I’d actually would like to see a stand down with respect to new features with a year or two of focus on bugs and robustness. 
If Qt and/or tkinter is feeling a little quirky to you then take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). It provides access to the full suite of widgets in tkinter and Qt (and WxPython &amp; Browser) in a more linear and straightforward fashion. Your application's GUI will look and operate exactly as if you wrote it directly in tkinter, Qt. It also allows you to easily switch between the supported GUI frameworks by changing only the import statement. To run your code on tkinter, import PySimpleGUI. To run on Qt import PySimpleGUIQt. PySimpleGUI is fully operational on tkinter, in Alpha on Qt, pre-Alpha for WxPython and the effort to port to running in a web browser was started a week ago and has been making great progress. PySimpleGUI runs well on raspberry Pi's. The Web version of PySimpleGUI is capable of running in the [repl.it](https://repl.it) environment, an incredible way to test and share the code. Check out this sample program that runs entirely in your web browser. [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUIWeb-Demos](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUIWeb-Demos). It's possible to develop a GUI application inside of a browser then run it on your Pi when enough of it is operational. I would recommend starting with the straight PySimpleGUI (tkinter) version as it's the most mature and complete among the ports. If you have questions, just post an issue on the [GitHub page](http://www.PySimpleGUI.com) and you'll get support. &amp;#x200B;
Cool stuff. I am working on parsing my monthly bank and credit card statements. I dump the results to a csv file. I then load it in pandas for visualization stuff.

I've been using noip to get dns records for my house and a few other places not on static IP addresses so I can set up backups, VPNs, etc. But you have to login every 30 days and I can't seem to get LetsEncrypt to give me a cert and this causes others problems with certificates. So I bought a domain, set it up in a free cloudflare account, and rolled a python script to run inside each network I want, get that network's external IP, and then update the A record in cloudflare to make sure it's correct. Run every 30 minutes, and voila, dynamic DNS without the noip hassle.

do you have it on git?
keep trying!
I would like to see more complete support for type hints. I am used to the rich type system of Rust, so I constantly miss things like being able to have recursive types (think JSON). The syntax for introducing generics is also incredibly clumsy. It really just needs to be built in.
i'll check it out but I am stubbornly pushing through this at the moment to completion. 
why libraries have you used? i've always just used `pd.read_excel` and it's worked fine.
I would much prefer to use anything over a CSV truthfully. Just using the CSV currently to keep experimenting with it while I find a nice, “easy” database to use. Thank you for the sqlite3 suggestion! Completely forgot about using it (despite my time using it with Django). I see no issues with using it in place of Mongo/mysql. 
Any framework behind a recent enough NGINX will work just fine with HTTP/2.

I'm learning PyGame to build a turn based roguelike arena combat game with environmental factors and deck-building card game mechanics. Really cool learning the patterns of game programming.
[Effective pandas](https://leanpub.com/effective-pandas) by Tom Augspurger come to mind... Also chapter three of [Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas is not bad at all, also has good chapters on other DS ecosystem libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, ... Just keep in mind that the book uses older versions of the libraries for some of the libraries, so some functions he demonstrates may have been deprecated and replaced by now (seem to remember that is the case for some of the `sklearn` examples...). 
Awesome! Never even considered trying something like this, despite my undying love for time attack. Post some updates for us in the future! 
Nice and easy man , i have also almost made the same https://youtu.be/JmOqmKdodQg 
I do not. I see quite a bit about git in various posts, but haven’t ever looked into it. Care to share a little more to push me towards it? I’m so new to all this i still find myself trying to even figure out what everything is. 
Damn. About to start something very similar myself. Any advice? 
Trying out some ML techniques on the MNIST data. I have way more experience in R and I find myself wrestling with Python semantics more than with the concepts and guts of various ML models and strategies - which I already cut my teeth on in R. Whats a good intuition for when something I want to do to an object is a method `object.method()` vs. a function `function(object)`? I feel like the documentation examples are a little lackluster, so I'm spending a lot of time on stack overflow and blogs looking at example code using the same methods/functions in different contexts. R seems a bit cognitively simpler, where everything you want to do is a function.

Doing something similar using Flask and PostgreSQL. In some cases, using the various APIs of the analytics and advertising platforms and others, scraping the results or importing the CSVs from email. Then, the auto generation of slides based on the results. I think we're in the same boat. Automating our jobs away :) 
Same here as well as Talk Python to Me. Michael Kennedy does a great job with these podcasts. Brian Okken, who cohosts Python Bytes, is knowledgeable and keeps the discussion fun. He also has his own podcast called Test &amp; Code. 
I’m pulling the file from a requests.get() call, the response.content of which I was able to decode successfully for two other reports from the same site with decode(‘utf-8’), but apparently that solution has its limits. I also tried pulling the report in HTML format and parsing it with BeautifulSoup, but the html output is somewhat unworkable. pd.read_excel, here I come!
That’s awesome. I spent over a month parsing different websites with varying success(i had the weirdest issues when i would go to email my formatted list of articles to myself). I may try and revisit parsing/scraping again in order to verify accuracy(such as week/month end balance accuracy checks). I have not used pandas yet. Am I missing out on anything big?
I'm working in implementing my own financial administration program... again. I'm so fucking lazy.

That's pretty cool! I've been into FM stuff lately (Deflemask and DX7/Dexed) and thought a machine learning approach to synth programming might be cool, or patch converters
This has been added in v0.2.0. See the new post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/al0i1j/ezpq_v020_an_easy_parallel_queueing_system/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/ezpq).
github is an online repository store for code. it's backed up, you can access it from multiple machines, share with others, but most importantly it's for revision management. so you can change code, then commit, compare differences, go back to a previous state when you screw things up, etc.

Thanks, I just read up on `makemigrations --fake-initial` and it looks like that’s what I want, subject to tons of checking that people haven’t manually been altering the database (which is no doubt true). I guess I should run the migration against an empty database and find some tool to compare the schema against the production DB, etc. to note any differences. Does that sound right?
I’ll look into it and see if it’s a better fit for what I have in mind for this project. Thanks!

I also tried pyinstaller for the first time with it. You can play around with it here. https://www.dropbox.com/s/qe2l8sx0o6rm31r/nameGenerator.zip?dl=0
messing around with google fire, asyncio, some aws, and if all that works out then maybe look at some GUI packages
I don't disagree. I'm saying if Microsoft is picking something, they're going to pick something that exists today that is well accepted (so not new). They're also going to treat it like an LTS version on Linux. So you might get 3.7 this year, but in 10 years, it'll still be 3.7.
Oh that makes sense. I agree with you.
Point 1 is omething I'm thinking of doing for Yatra.com . Care to share? Happy to contribute.
Different data types have different methods associated with them. Like a list has .append(), a dictionary has .items(), and so on. These methods are available because the data type is a class for which member functions are available. Similarly, when you create a class object, which is an instance of a custom data type, you can do object.custom\_method() to utilize its baked in functionality. When you use a function, you just pass in the the required parameters and it doesn't have to be called off of a certain object instance. So the object.method() is used for calling functions available within the object's type, whereas, function(object) is passing an object to a standalone function.
If you're into data science, try AnalyticsVidhya and machinelearningmastery.com. It's not really news but very nice tutorials. I also like to learn new stuff. Currently I'm following the Flask Mega Tutorial in my spare time and it's amazing. 
&gt; I've honestly yet to find a compelling argument for why writing VBA for Excel is bad I mean VBA is a buggy language that's hard to debug. Seriously, why doesn't Excel follow order of operations (not 100% on VBA)? You have to stick extra parentheses to make Excel do the right thing. Try taking a fractional negative exponent in VBA using the ^ sign. I'm sure you know have to call the Excel power function, which is different than the power function. I don't disagree that well made Excel workbooks with buttons are handy. I also end up with ones that aren't quite right and nobody knows how to fix. It's also stupid to say don't use VBA, use Python. No, I really want Excel integration. If the problem is post process the data in this way, then maybe Python is the right tool.
Just made a anagram finder. You enter a string, it cycles through all the permutations of the string then it compares each permutation to the 100,000 most common English words to see if it has any anagrams. Works but I’d still like to optimize it more.
I'm making a delivery task tracker for use with my blood bike charity. [It's open source](https://github.com/theocranmore/bloodbike/tree/theo) and I'm hoping one day it'll be useful for a variety of charities or companies. Still in the early stages of course.
Thanks mate
Adding a REST API to a Django app I've built for work. I'm slightly more focused on building/deploying the container with Ansible at the moment (using AWX for push-button deployments).
Unsatisfied with the charts and reporting capabilities with MyFitnessPal to track my progress, I have been playing with [this myfitnesspal library](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal) and then taking my data and putting it into pandas/matplotlib/seaborn to build my own graphs/views.
Me, too! I'm a couple months in. As with any language, the best practice is to submerge yourself in it, so keep on keepin' on, and cheers :)
Rewriting an app that stores and formats display of Pokémon Go nests, this time in Django. (Take 1 used TSV files, take 2 was on SQLite, this is moving to Django/Maria so I can host it on my server and eventually allow trusted others to edit it as well—and so I don’t have to deal with entering raw SQL joins manually)
I'm using [Cronicle](https://github.com/jhuckaby/Cronicle/) on my server, and it works quite well.
A reddit bot to detect reposts 
Oh this interests me. I love personal finance and i'm planning on doing a web app with Django and Python. I currently use Excel and i've been trying to go beyond the spreadsheet. Do you mind sharing your ideas? I'd love to hear other possobilities for this project.
We also have another team building it for their app in Java. They are using existing frameworks. I started from scratch with a vision and the base app is now solid. Completely custom workflow. One of the key goals was to build something that anyone can use it even without scripting or automation knowledge. It has been successful as my entire team is building scripts and have no experience. I’ve also built in an outside module where we can build custom abstraction for the target application independently from the base app, which means no rebuilding the base app when we need to make changes, and the base app stays independent code that is not cluttered with our target app code. If that makes any sense lol.
no worries, i don't have any opinion on it, but other people have suggested it is. and since it's focused on retro games and you were doing a retro game i figured it might be interesting.
Actually I'm learning Vue (despite this being a Python sub, lol), as I could use some more modern web development practices than JQuery 
Refinements to my chatbot, mostly, along with a few small steps towards a decent combat simulator for my story generator.
I could see that. My goal though, and I didn't really state it, is to learn pygame to make a 2d isometric game... I don't know the pygame library very well and I'm fairly new to python so I figure start small, get used to the engine... maybe there's a better project than this but it's the one I'm working on atm LOL. I will check out pyxel though. I have some retro style games bouncing around the old noggin. I was just more curious about the differences. I also have arcade (?) library for python someone had suggested elsewhere. Again... one step at a time :D
What's it do?
Are you treating it as a vision or signal problem?
Not sure yet, both have worked in practice. The hard part is determining which works better
Thank you for sharing, I'll try to learn it. 
Take a look at the zork engine, if you haven't already!
Data mining challenge for MRS mining challenge 2019
Integrating with a SOAP api and working on data sync issues. It is...*painful* at times.
1 - you can setup a crontab to restart your python script automatically when it fails, or on reboots or every x amount of time. 2 - you can setup a git repository, and use a service like github to update your program on the pi. It will manage the version control, and you won't have to upload the code to the pi everytime. You'll just need to connect to the pi via ssh, pull from the repo, and restart your script. 3 - For first timers into GUI programming, PyQt (and the Qt framework in general), are pretty bad choices, as it has quite a steep learning curve, and if you're not too much into OOP, it'll get crazy complicated. Many people would suggest pysimpleGUI, but it's just enforcing bad programming practices. If you intend on actually learning about GUI development, I suggest you start with tkinter. It's built into python, and has a decent selection of widgets. Documentation for it can be found in the official python docs, and on effbot.org. It doesn't have as many widgets as PyQt though. If you're hellbent on pyqt, I'll suggest you at least install the pyqt5-tools python package. It's not a python module, it's a collection of tools to make GUI building easier (Qt Designer is a WYSIWYG GUI editor). You can then use pyuic (included in pyqt5-tools) to convert the .ui file into a python module you can use to actually code your functions in.
Biggest hurdle I've found I came across was looking through html and realizing there was a ton of JS blocking different aspects. Probably not the most efficient way to handle this (I'd love opinions on this btw), but I'm using Selenium with a headless Chrome driver. So far it works well, but I kept having difficulty after 3 or 4 times pulling data, the website would no longer find the webpage. As a fix now I'm trying to write the program to go to the main page, enter in the relevant information into the text boxes and do a manual search.... idk if it's the most efficient way but it's slowly making it's way to working 
Oh sweet! I’ll have to look into that since I do work from multiple computers. 
I’ll have to look into that since I do have multiple computers I work on. Would be nice to have the ability to work where and share my work!

Pretty much, my app has a lot of logic involved and I figured I know Python better than Java so why not offload most of it to the web. It takes forever writing basic things in Java, or mocking things up too, then there is also restructuring too. Since the app logic evolves, it's much easier to do the work in the web than to work with Android framework's conditions.
Bingo!
Well, the order of the overhead is really debatable and depends on the application. &amp;#x200B; IMO the overhead of 2-3 microseconds per function call is completely negligible for the majority of applications written in Python. Mind also that you can turn off contracts in the production with literally zero run-time cost in case you would consider using them. &amp;#x200B; Just out of curiosity, what field do you work in that this overhead would matter? And what overhead would be acceptable? I never really tried to optimize icontract for speed since I never encountered a scenario that the overhead would matter, but I would gladly optimize if somebody else would need it.
absolutely, good luck!
I'll give it a look, thank you!
I've been trying to learn about servers as much as possible, partly out of curiosity, partly out of wanting to gain full-stack knowledge. So I've started to make a server in python from the ground up. http.server is noted to be not safe for production, so I'm on the hunt to find out what *is* safe for production. Right now it just uses the socketserver library; I can serve html files, send a 404 page, but that's about how far I've gotten.
Well, it's not "on me" if I am an innocent user of an operating system which is bundled with Python, and uses the `python3` command for legacy reasons. `python3` launching Python 4.x then becomes incredibly confusing. This is the expected outcome of following a 3.9 release with a 4.0. At that point it is "on" the curators of the language.
Check out some tutorials on Flask, I'm using it now and then to build websites on Python.

I want to get this but I already spent a bunch of my book budget for the month yesterday ... not sure that I can get the most out of it when I feel like I could google most of the recipes I need. Then again, these put those recipes all in one place and exploring each book will probably give me new ideas I never considered. 
Try to jump into BeautifulSoup, Selenium &amp; Scrapy. Pretty much all needed to make various kinds of scrapers.
Need this if you got public repo..
Straight to the link: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/programming-cookbooks I’m not a big fan of these cookbooks but some might get inspiredby their content for some projects.
I understand that distinction, but I don't yet have the intuition for when designers build one over the other, so a frustrating thing is trying it both ways if it fails. Like a USB stick, it seems to work on the 3rd or 4th try for some unknown reason.
You wil go far. However beware that many high tier python programmers prefer object oriented style. Just a heads up if you plan to take a look into many python repositories. I personally prefer functional style but there are use-cases.. OOP is good too for maintenance.
There is some good taking you through that exact thing. Maybe try prototyping your adventure using twine before coding it in python. 
Yuck. 
Appreciate the dedication - thanks for the reply :) I'll check it out
How is this going? I'm interested in scraping too.
A little app that pulls deltas off a database and pushes those deltas to Kafka. There are a thousand tools that already do this, but none seem to make it as easy as I want it to be. 
I have so many projects open at once I don't know where to start... 1. I'm working on a bot for the r/1000DaysOfPractice subreddit which counts the days you logged as well as rewards you for practicing. I also made a simple Discord bot for the subreddit's server that clears the history, logs deleted comments, reports on suspicious behaviour in the subreddit etc. 2. A Discord/Reddit bot for moderators that posts every new submission into a designated chat for mods to take action and for those that have everything sent to the unmod queue it uses reactions from the mods to decide if the post should be approved or not. 3. Discord server managment: a bot that's designed to setup a server for the first time and assign roles to new users, as well as other basic features I can think of. 4. "Machine learning": using a subreddit's submission titles to generate a list of keywords for the different flairs the sub offers to auto-assign flairs with AutoMod (the keywords in AutoMod get manually updated so we humans can make sure my "AI" got sensible keywords).
Hey! Please share your repo once done, or any resources where others could possible do the same. Planning to make this too for modern UI's but cannot figure out many things.. Here's what I do now for modern UI's: - using electron js with python.. very bad and slow.. - using python web browser(basically selenium) and loading web app, then communicating or transfering values using selenium itself. Very bad idea. Very useless in real life... - using tkinter or grids and drawing background art and controls over them. Control is also sort of a grid but with events... Very lengthy and unmaintainable code. 
It gets better when you work a lot with object-oriented programming, but i have to admit that programming with objects is the only thing that i would prefer java for
What steps/resources/materials did you take in order to learn Vue? I'm assuming that you're using Vue as frontend and Django as backend?
Thx for the advice! I found scrappy to be a bit complicated compared to besutifulsoup. Haven’t tried selenium yet. Im just really digging into sklearn right now though to get a solid foundation for ml.
When you know neither flasks nor django, what do you recommend? 
Making a bot to do my languages homework for me
Same here! About a week in. We got this
Agree. I adviced my former company to stop using it. The project has some serious bugs not solved since year or so. BS, Requests &amp; Selenium have been best. Along with some regex (yotube got gud turorials on regex). They're all I need to make any scraper now :D
Combination of my small knowledge of Java beforehand, googling code examples, and caffeine. I’ve found that it’s much easier to start at Java and move down to Python than starting from Python.
Maybe just put on github and ask people to try it here?
Here's a post that looks like what you need: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7142342/get-window-position-size-with-python
Yeah I believe that's it. Thanks!
Yes, sort of. You get those coordinates from your operating system’s window manager. Depends on your OS. There’s probably a tool for that in PiPy : [http://cheeseshop.python.org](http://cheeseshop.python.org) 
It provides info about about pokemons, moves and items. So far the pokemon part is working but I should have the rest done by the end of this week 
I think you're overly worried about a problem that's not really an issue. Maybe one distro had a bug, but again, that's on you/them, and not python. You still have assumptions of which python is installed. \`python3\` isn't very descriptive.
* Compile a standalone executable/app for your target operating systems * Make a page for your game on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and upload your game files. Write a helpful description and note that you're looking for feedback. Include one or two animated GIFs if possible to give people a sense of gameplay. * Let people know it exists on social media.
That's exactly why I'm building the library! The digitone allows a user to tag a patch with descriptors such ass Bass, kick, pad, etc. There are 32 different tags, 29 of which are descriptive of the sound. My hypothesis is that if I feed an algorithm enough sounds tagged correctly, I should be able to make a somewhat reliable patch generator. Doing seq2seq for patch conversion would also be a great idea.
good luck
Are you using SAML authentication? Possibly even SAML 1.1?
Probably the easiest. I don't think it feels as nice as compiling it or making a flask app though.

Well, I once wrote a static analyzer completely in Python, which meant searching through millions of nodes. I also wrote a parsing library, and it seems that many users care about performance (https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) Speed can also be relevant in Python backend applications, where Python is just a thin layer to the DB, and the response time matters. Generally, it isn't really important, because users can just refrain from adding contracts to functions that are called many times. My main concern would be that the run-time costs might add up, especially when using a functional style. But maybe it's not a big deal in practice. Anyway, I care about the interface much more than the performance.
Awesome!

Looks good!
Hello, I think I've read a couple of comments in this thread that aim to do the same, anyways I'm a dumb noob and I don't know if this is the right way to do it but here are my ideas: Use SQLite for database. I want it to be as lightweight as possible and SQLite seems to be the right answer for me. After all, it's going to be for personal use (and maybe for my family, if they're willing) These will be the tables I will create in the database (I had a better idea before but now I've forgotten so I'm trying to get my head around it again): 1. Daily transactions (for spending history, will keep track of the bank account I'm spending from, the category —whether it is food, rent, clothing, leisure, etc— and direction —whether income or expense) 2. Bank account's balance (will subtract or sum depending on the transactions) 3. Budget. 4. Savings I guess there's much more info to store here, but I can't think of more right now. I don't even know how to properly manage a budget, I know you're supposed to plan this before even spending anything, but since I don't know what I'm spending, I had a plan to create a function that looks at my spending data and sets a limit, a limit that will change and be modified according to my spending history. Say I spend $800 in snacks, the function will prompt me each month to say "You spent $800 last month in snacks, do you want to set this as your limit?" and if I say "Dude, I'm spending too much in snacks, there's no way I'm doing that again" and input the new value as my limit that will be written to my budget table. This same function will alert me on whether I reached and even surpass each limit. That's my idea anyway. I also want to focus on savings, my spending habits prevent me from saving money properly. I do have a separate account to direct some money to, and the plan for that account is to *not spend anything from it unless necessary*. But I fall for my own trap of "oops I just ran out of money for (commuting, laundry, food, etc) gotta use the savings money". I'm still yet to come with a good plan for this. Anyway so you didn't ask about my habits so moving on. As for the input I'm planning to get some mobile application working. I used to have a google drive sheet with offline access in my phone but since basically every app is now making it hot and slow I was thinking to use some texting app to log my transactions and send them over to the server. For the moment Telegram seems to be the best option for me, since you can create bots for it. But I don't even have the basics of the management system down so I'll worry about that later. I was also thinking about some lightweight web panel (don't know how light are django or flask) for easy access and display of data (charting, settings wizard, etc) but again, I'll have to worry about that later. &gt; I love personal finance Maybe you could give me some tips since clearly this is some problem that most probably programming a system won't solve.
My point was that there are other users who do care about these things, and might start using Python if they were added. What's the bug in print? I'm curious. Generally, I'm not aware of crucial open bugs in Python. I'd much prefer if they focused on improving the object &amp; type system, for example concerning iterators or dataclasses.
You are the best 😁
Regex is supppper cool. Agreed
 I’m relatively new too, but maybe a little further along than you. 1. I assume that you’re on a Mac or Linux OS if you’re working in terminal? I use win10, and having to log back in on reset is just my reality. You can make it a little less painful by adding yourself to sudoers, and disabling the password request on sudo and/or hammer out a bash script to remember your ssh keys 2. You shouldn’t have to delete your old program, I edit on the fly with the editors that ship with raspbian-lite, I prefer nano but vim is popular too. Just edit, save, overwrite and run. I make tKinter GUI’s and they suck to learn! But I do most of the work on the python installation on my win10 machine, and switch to the pi when I need to start using GPIOs. 3. I went with tKinter not pyqt, so I can only advise you on that. If you for some reason switch to tKinter “tKinter GUI application development “ was a game changer book for me (ISBN-13: 978-1849697941). Also, I found that most tKinter tutorials did their development in classes, which added complexity that I wasn’t necessarily ready for at the time. I took the time to learn them, but it slowed down my ability to roll out my first GUI.

Twisted also supports HTTP/2, as does Daphne which builds on Twisted. However neither offer any server-push functionality. Technically Quart is just the framework, it is [Hypercorn](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/hypercorn) that does the serving of HTTP/2 (Quart does allow for server-pushes to be initiated). Hypercorn supports server-push and HTTP/2 WebSockets which is more than Nginx or Twisted currently provide. Pretty much all the HTTP/2 functionality in Python though is built on [Hyper-h2](https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2).

Flask is almost trivial to get from zero to a "hello world"-style website. However, every added piece of complexity generally means reaching for a new plugin, new library, possibly reorganising your source files, and so on. Django is batteries-included from the get-go; harder to just start hacking with as it's more opinionated, but it's much easier to stay in a nice consistent django ecosystem for longer.
Yeah, I saw the previous discussion and the gist I got from it was I can write my own but I’ll miss out on features that ORMs already provide. I’ll checkout the flask link! Thank you.
Learning a bit about Flask and Dash frameworks, unit testing, and code architecture by building a custom time logging application for work. They wanted a custom interface to integrate with a 3rd party SaaS that has a Python API, so it's been a good excuse to pick up some new skills.
Well the bug(s) involves a couple of issues. The sep=‘ ‘ parameter doesn’t seem to work at all. Maybe I’m missing something in the way I’m using the parameter. This is on a Fedora 29 system completely updated. Frankly I haven’t spent much time on this as I simply used tabs to organize print out. The bigger problem I have is with the end=‘ ‘ parameter. This works fine in simple expressions but seems to be completely ignored if you have more complex expressions in the print statement. This became a big time sink and frankly I haven’t come up with a solution. I’d post code but I’m on my cell phone at the moment. I spent sometime last night on the bug tracker to see if there have been similar problems reported but to be honest searching there sucks. At least the search phrases I used did nothing to thin down the reports. The thing that bugs me is that “end=“ works fine for simple print statements so I believe my usage is correct. It is seemingly ignored when more complex things happen within the print statement. In any event the more I use Python the more it looks like it could use a lot of help with what exists at the moment. I really think a year of debugging, new tests and a focus on robustness is in order. 
At the moment I'm not using anything as a backend, serving data moreso from public API.

Theres a book called "invent your own computer games with python 4e" that literally teaches you how to do exactly this. It is written by Al Sweigart.

&gt;The ugly syntax for function types is annoying but there are worse problems Python isn't a first class functional language, so this makes sense. that said, you can absolutely do things like `f = Callable` if you so desire, which would give you `f[[f[[A], B], F[A]], F[B]]` (I'm unclear what `F` is supposed to be in this example, so I can't make a stronger statement with more context. &gt; The ad hoc polymorphism mechanism chosen is annoying &gt;, there’s no clear indication in the code that a given class implements a particular Protocol Yes, this is the point of protocols. If there were an indication that a class implemented a protocol, it wouldn't be ad-hoc polymorphism. It would be static. &gt;Second, there’s no “post facto” instancing of Protocol like it’s possible to do with Haskell’s or Scala’s typeclasses, or Go’s interfaces. This is because python types are objects, not typeclasses. This isn't an argument against type annotations, but against object oriented code. &gt;No support for lightweight parametrically polymorphic product types Dataclasses &gt;No support for lightweight recursive product types Dataclasses &gt;No higher kinded types I'll admit this has annoyed me, but the places where I can get use from higher-kinded types are relatively few (or difficult to annotate anyway). I'd love to be able to have strongly typed numpy or tensorflow operations, but numpy does so much magic already that typing it is mostly a dream. &gt;And so… no fixed point functors and other niceties Among other things, you'd need to at a minimum bind `F` to a type that could be parameterized. The default binding for a Generic is `Any`, so `continuations: F['Cofree[F, A]'` will fail to typecheck because `Any` can't be parameterized by `Cofree[x, y]`. If you can define a binding for F: `F = NewType('F', Cofreeable)`, this might work, although I may be wrong and that the type system may not support this at all.
Working on the first (zeroth) week of the third class in the Rice Fundamentals of Computing specialization, Principals of Computing, through Coursera. The first two classes were tough, but fun, learning OOP while designing games in Python (pong, memory, blackjack, asteroids, etc.). But I get the feeling sh-t just got serious; a lot of this appears to be moving in a heavily math-focused direction, and one with rigid style demands. I'm wrapping my mind around enumeration atm (which hasn't yet been taught as a function, but seems awfully handy for my current project). They've stressed that they're teaching best practices for any language, and aren't focusing on Python-specific strategies, which is encouraging me to really grok what enumeration actually _does_, so I can choose to use it or easily substitute it with something less Python-specific. We're working on making a game of 2048, and my current task is to make the function (method, eventually, I assume, though what they're really getting at is learning to develop algorithms) that merges any given line. Easy-peasy, right? Meanwhile, every line of code makes me realize that I don't understand anything, especially syntax, as comprehensively as I'd like to. At all. How did I get this far?! WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S HOLY IS WRONG WITH ME lol It's painful, but ultimately fruitful, and this old dog'll learn new tricks yet. &lt;3 http://online.rice.edu/courses/principles-of-computing-1/

Why do you think they're angrier? I think probably they're busier on Tuesdays than in the weekend. Also, people prefer something new and shiny over an update. Go figure. Don't let it discourage you!
Thanks. I'm lacking OOP as I'm very comfortable in bare-metal C. The closest I got to something similar was using structs, but thats about it. Have to level up.

Interesting, I never really used print in that way, I prefer to do the formatting myself (using % or f'...') If you do have code that demonstrates it, I'd be happy to take a look. If you're wrong, maybe I can help you spot why. And if you're right, I will enjoy backing you on the mailing list.

Ah, good point about new vs. update. I'm looking at the % upvoted and get perplexed as to why someone would downvote a project I've spent an embarrassing amount of time on, haha.

xlwings creator here, thanks for sharing! I thought I'd take the opportunity to promote the [xlwings developer survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhaeukbf_NsE9PzSF3UaPbG4Q-aspw4hw2LBh_RJAfSM1Faw/viewform) that we just launched. From the first answers (it's only been up since Sunday night) you can already tell that xlwings is used for many different things. Not everybody is using it as VBA replacement. Some people are just automating the tedious task of pulling a bunch of different data sources and pasting the values into Excel for some reporting (possibly after doing some number crunching). In that sense they just run a python script that produces the report, but the receiver of the report wouldn't even have to know that xlwings was involved nor have Python installed.
Thanks, &amp;#x200B; I've tried that and haven't heard back. I'll try and post the code I have this week.

No problem, I know the struggle. Too many times I made something pretty cool, but couldn't get anyone to care about it. If you care about adoption, I can make a suggestion: Focus on providing examples that show - 1) Why they should use your library (I think most of your examples focus on how) 2) Why your library is better than multiprocessing, or other queue libraries. It's hard to get users to take a risk on a new library. You have to figure out what they need and what they're worried about, and then provide the information in a way that makes sense to them.

Per [Nick Coghlan](https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html), a CPython core dev: &gt; After this post was originally written back in 2014, subsequent discussions on the core python-dev mailing list led to the conclusion that the release after 3.9 will probably just be 3.10. However, a 4.0 will presumably still happen some day, and the premise of this article is expected to hold for that release: it will be held to the same backwards compatibility obligations as a Python 3.X to 3.X+1 update. Which is obviously the right way to go, because breaking all the `python3
And it's not going to happen, CPython core devs agreed to make that 3.10 back in 2014.

I've got a couple of Selenium projects going for some web-based services my work has to use that have \*no\* API. One requires clicking a bunch of buttons to zip up some files, and then download the zip files. We need to make a local archive of everything, so the process happens hundreds of times. This is more-or-less a one-off, with a second script to be run each month to only archive the most recent data. The second thing is a website we need to submit a bunch of historical data to. We have it in a nice CSV, but the web service has no way to import that in. So I made a script to read in whatever is in the CSV file and then sign into the service and fill out the forms for each row in the CSV. This is still in testing, as we're working with the vendor on finalizing what the forms looks like, but I have a whole bunch of test code ready to be expanded on as needed. This should also be a one-off, but if successful, it will be implemented at a sister site who is using the same service. This is my first real dive into Requests and Selenium, and while it has taken me a while to learn how to get it to do what I need, it's been easy enough that I feel really pleased with Selenium, and myself.

I’ve got an internship, where they have a program in C, that outputs csv files. They have me converting a juypter file into python for visualization, and then adding on functionality.

Hey man, i'm really grateful for you taking your time to reply with such detail. &gt;Maybe you could give me some tips since clearly this is some problem that most probably programming a system won't solve. It's funny talking about this on a Python sub, but i'm always glad to help. For me saving is like a religion, so i'm always happy to preach the word that saved me, helped me organize my life and kickstart my future. &gt;I also want to focus on savings, my spending habits prevent me from saving money properly. I do have a separate account to direct some money to, and the plan for that account is to not spend anything from it unless necessary. But I fall for my own trap of "oops I just ran out of money for (commuting, laundry, food, etc) gotta use the savings money". I'm still yet to come with a good plan for this. That is me 6 years ago, before i convinced myself i had to change. My saving rate was close to 0% at the time and when i started my saving system i was really close to 0 on my bank account. I had no idea how my money disappeared so fast. First thing i did was get a transactions tracker app on my phone where i tracked every cent i made and spent daily. Sure you can say that's too much, but in my mind if i'm going to track my spending i have to do it right so that i can see where my money is going. In the long run (6 years for me now) every cent counts, trust me. I prefer a simple app with no clutter, just press a button to add an expense, choose the category and that's it. After a couple of months i created an excel spreadsheet and imported my daily transactions organized by subcategories, for example: Rent, Utilities, Food, Groceries, Clothing, etc. Then i organized the subcategories by categories, for example: House for Rent and Utilities; Supermarket for Groceries and Hygiene Products; Restaurants, Bar and Cinema for Leisure, etc. By then i could see where my money was going so i put a relative weight in front of each main category, for example House takes up 30% of my income, Supermarket 15%, etc. This was a big deal for me because it helped me see exactly where my money was going and what was essential or not. Now you can finally start writing down your goals (this is extremely important, if you don't set yourself an objective you just drift around clueless), the main goal is to say how much you want to save given your budget and expenses structure you previously drawn, for example say you want to save 10 or 15%. Personally i aim for at least 20% of my income. Afterwards you can start messing around with your past data to see where you could cut in order to reach your goal. By this time it's very easy to see how this is possible, you just have to look at the data. It may sound hard but once you automate this system you'll feel like your playing a game or even like you're running your own company, remember that your money can work for you, not the other way around. One very important tip is to save some small percentage for "FUCK YOU" money, which you can spend without giving yourself excuses, just like a cheat day in diet, this will help you stay on course. I hope i didn't bother you with so much text, but if you found this interesting and you need help, hit me up with a message, i'll be happy to reply!
You have a mailing list or something? I would use the shit out of that. 
I understand perfectly well that Python is dynamically and strongly typed. I also like Python a lot, as anyone who wants to verify can see. And though I'd word it differently, I think the author's criticisms overlap a lot with my own. I see this as a problem that actually goes back further to when "proper" abstract classes were first added to Python. There was, and still is, a weird hack there to handle the fact that a class in a third-party module might implement the interface you care about, but since it's third-party it doesn't subclass your abstract base class. The `register()` method of abstract base classes was introduced as a workaround, a way you could tag arbitrary third-party classes as conforming to your interface. But this is still a hack: it speaks to the fact that checks are of the simplistic `isinstance()`/`issubclass()` variety, rather than being based on richer declaration of interfaces. Which really is at odds with Python itself: the whole point of a (roughly) interfacely-typed language -- which is what Python in practice really is, and what "duck typing" really means -- is that you're not supposed to care if something is an instance of a particular class, or a subclass of a particular parent. But abstract classes, and now the type annotation system, keep forcing the "must be an instance/subclass" paradigm back on us. Put more simply, it's a question of nominal versus structural typing. Python in practice depends heavily on a structural approach -- where, for example, you don't care if something is a `list`, you care if it implements iteration and indexing -- but type annotations, both in the standard library's `typing` module and in mypy, are very heavily nominal. Right now, mypy works around some of this with literal special-case handling, and the `typing` module provides weird sentinel objects to stand in for a handful of important protocols and interfaces, but the root of the problem is an inability to declare, in a formal and reusable way, the structure and interface you actually care about. Which means it's much more of a struggle to write and use type annotations in Python, since the whole annotation and checking system has been built around nominal typing, and real-world Python tends to care about structural typing instead.
I've been working on yet another weave/tangle clone. You'd think with all the variations out there I could find *one* that does what I want, but no.... Got it working end-to-end with one feature. Now just gotta add the rest.

I'm developing a module that performs GridSearchCV for Deep Neural Nets parameters, based on Keras, including size of hidden layers and number of hidden layers. Currently supporting simultaneous fine-tuning of up to 2 features, but can otherwise fine-tune for any DNN-related parameters in a single run, with sequential steps of optimisation.

I've been looking to adopt a dog recently and the agency I am going through doesn't have a "Get emailed when new dogs are posted" function. I wrote a script that scrapes their website looking for new dogs, and it emails me if it finds one. I have it running on my raspberry pi so it has been fun learning about chron jobs.

Many languages use this pattern. Object.change() changes a direct property of the object being performed upon. If the number is one you want to re-use (ie. you need to change a field or property of this object), this is the proper way to do it. The other method is basically for a one-time, throwaway calculation.
Interfaces and APIs are sorely missing in Python
Im currently working on a way to improve the sales forecasting accuracy of the company I work at. Im using statsmodels and pandas to make the forecast, its challenging because it's the first time I'm using python to make something real useful.
I have looked into it and I have figured out that I need to change what `class DefaultInput(BaseInput):` outputs, I have thrown in a if statement: `class DefaultInput(BaseInput):` `param_type_cls = click.ParamType` `@property` `def type_attrs(self):` `type_attrs = {}` `if click.ParamType == 'email':` `type_attrs['type'] = 'email'` `type_attrs['click_type'] = 'email'` `return type_attrs` `else:` `type_attrs['type'] = 'text'` `type_attrs['click_type'] = 'text'` `return type_attrs` but it doesn't work because click.ParamType is just a type not a string that I can run a if statement on, is there something that contains the type=email from my @click.option statements?
So as someone who has traded successfully before - how is this going to be successful, considering high frequency trading typically requires very fast contact to a trading platform, and the fact that there are a lot of HFT bots out there already. It seems like it would be crowded out. I’m not against testing (and tweaking) it, but it seems like it wouldn’t work except for things that large players aren’t in as much, like crypto currencies (personally I don’t like crypto currencies generally, but they do have a lower presence of institutional investors)

Threads do have the nice feature of being lighter, but being able to communicate between processes using a Queue works quite well.
Former brokerage experience here. I want to give everyone a really clear heads-up: This is ***not*** high-frequency trading (HFT). This is *algorithmic* trading. There is a difference that essentially boils down to the speed at which the trader (or their platform) can execute a trade. An individual will *never* outpace the Citadels of the world. They, and firms like them, have spent fortunes to reduce shave trade times by fractions of a second so small that you can't blink that fast. I don't recommend algo-trading, but if you want to do it, be my guest. Please don't think you are HFT-ing though. That game is rigged against you and has been for more than a decade at this point.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Lately I've been messing around with genetic algorithms. This week the one I'm ~~sacrificing my sleep to~~ working on is reproducing the album cover for Thriller by drawing triangles. It's not working splendidly, PIL (which I use for the image manipulation) is giving me a bit of trouble, and progress slows down like shit after 500-600 generations, but it's good fun, and when I squint at my 1060'th generation's image it kinda looks like it's got the general gist of it, so that's cool!
So I always wanted to code a tactical RPG game, but I couldn't rapidly wrap my mind around how to actually code this kind of battle. Since I'm recovering from a foot injury, I actually started to code it, and it's easier than I thought, going one step at a time (also decoupling rendering from logic loop), using `BearLibTerminal` and `Tdl`. Also, I'm working on a small project using `Flask`/HTML/CSS (bootstrap) in order to visualise exported links (images/gifs/webms) from a website in CSV format. Works great so far, and I finally learned and used `Flask` for a true project! My only problem is that I'm annoyed by the CSS part, as usual when doing web development. I'm now looking at `sqlite` to store the data, having usernames (instead of auto-generated ones every logging), etc. It's nice to finally have a real project to work on using these libraries, I'm learning at a much better rate!
Thank you!

I started looking into pygame! I want to make my own sidescroller running game. Gonna be a long project for home so I can practice my python skills. 
Thanks for all your work on PySimpleGUI. It really is the most pythonic and 80/20 way of doing GUIs I have ever seen. I went from just having a load of code to having a full GUI app with tabs in a single .exe in less than 2 days. I had never done that before and couldn't believe how quick it was. In fact the main thing that slowed me down over those 2 days was embedding an image that still showed after doing a PyInstaller one-file compile. There is a slightly hacky workaround on StackOverflow I can explain if you or anyone is interested. Did I read you re-prioritised the web front-end stuff above Kivy? Both are exciting but I really want to get a Spotify Desktop kind of look for my GUIs and either rightly or wrongly see Kivy as the way. It is really so exciting seeing what you are adding and how rapidly its happening. I don't think I have been this excited about updates to a python library since the early days of pandas.
I watched yesterday a talk about Elixir. Thy guy talking provides some reasoning. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVrnoxNbOts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVrnoxNbOts) The exact moment when this topic comes briefly up is 11:16
"There are a few hundred lines of logs per second." Insert a few hundred records at a time. Whatever maximum your database allows. You can also commit after a few inserts to speed things up. In addition you should insert and commit after a certain timeout -- in case the log file does not accumulate full buffer within a few seconds. Also I would question if an SQL database is a right tool for what you are doing. SQL provides many benefits, but at a price: transactions being logged, concurrent access management, etc.

Hi erez Thanks for the support! This has been bothering me so much I took a drive down to the library to look at these two problems again. The issue with the end=' ' came down to a parenthesis out of position. That is one down. The issue with sep=' ' is a bit more complex. From what I can see it expects a text field before it will append a separator. In other words this works: print ("{0:&lt;3d}".format(x + 1), "hello", sep="&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;", end=' ') However this doesn't: print ("{0:&lt;3d}".format(x + 1),sep="&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;", end=' ') You can replace the 'x = 1' addition with a constant like 42 and it still will not apply the separator. What I'm trying to do is to print out a line of numerical values to produce a row of text that has effectively for numeric values in columns. The first column (the code above) is just a line number, the other three fields being a bit more complex. I had hoped to get better control over alignment and positioning but frankly tabs worked out better. To the best that I can determine "sep=""' will not work with number fields. Also note that the angle brackets are used in the exmaple just to make it obvious when the separator is applied.
I am learning implementing python code into django. If you want to make it into a web app hit me up, it could be good project for me too.
Please don't perpetuate the confusion of "strong" and "static" typing. In a statically-typed language, both names and values have types, and bindings of values to names are type-checked for compatibility. In a dynamically-typed language, only values have types; binding of a value to a name does not type-check. In a weakly-typed language, some number of operations on values of incompatible types will succeed anyway, due to rules mandating the conversion/coercion of the types of the operands (i.e., `1 + "2"` might succeed due to a rule saying "2" is coerced to an integer for that operation). In a strongly-typed language, such operations simply fail with some kind of error indicating the operands were of incompatible types. It is possible for a language to be both statically and weakly typed; C is the usual example given, because of some of its coercion rules and stupid pointer tricks.

Deploying as a Flask app is definitely a good way to go here. I'm working on a text based adventure game, as well, in the vein of Zork with Python and Flask, and some JS for the web side of things, of course. My version will have a "Notes" side bar that allows each user to post a note on each "frame" to help (or confuse) future adventurers. The flask app and front end are all done, I just need to write the second half of the actual game.
That's awesome !

Sweet. That might come in handy for me parsing government data.
You could probably sell it if it helped people figure out where to go out for lunch.

&gt;Please don't perpetuate the confusion of "strong" and "static" typing. I am not. In the first paragraph he says there are stronger type systems than Python. He does not say Python is weakly typed. I am trying to understand why you mentioned dynamic and static typing here.
What does it do?
I am working on a project I call [HueScoreAlerts](https://github.com/MichaelCduBois/Hue-Score-Alerts). It is my first **big** GitHub project that I am releasing. I am wrestling with making a few things: 1. Adding functionality for different colors via custom setting. 2. Making it easier to distribute/install for personal use by many people. 3. Adding more sports down the line. I am toying with the idea of making it a hosted service that will run on my server where people will register to get it setup.
For that I would use a lambda.
Not sure what general advise I can give without knowing anything about your use case. I recommend asking something specific to a stats or machine learning subreddit. You'll probably get some good advise. Alternatively if you PM some specifics I might be able to give you some advise. 
Personally for large sites I like Django, it's batteries included (comes with a user system and a ton of other stuff) and even though it demands you do everything the Django way, it results in better structured and probably more efficient code.

More information about turing pattern: https://www.fbs-osaka-kondolabo.net/research This simulation suppose a two types of coloured molucule which is surrounded by 6 molucules and affects each other, and the relationship between the two types of molcules is: * If the number of molcules which surround the molcule and has opposite colour of it is more than n(init and you can set it by the argument,and maximum is 6), the central moclule's colour will be reversed. * if molcules around a molcule and molcules around them also has same colour, the central molcule's color will be reversed. you can repete that operation N (init and you can set it by the argument) times and make various patterns. The initial state of the molcule distribution is set as random, but it is easy to modify the program to change it.

Yeah I've tried that. Filed a bug on it this morning. I hope it is just something with my configuration.
Oh it's not the css that trips me up, it's simply putting together what I have pictured in my mind. Same with my drawing, woodworking, everything
I believe many people use "strong" as if it's a synonym for "static". While the precise definitions of the terms aren't always nailed down, that's not even close to the case. You went along with it, though, and now you're trying to confuse things even further by bringing in "safe", which is yet another term people often use as a synonym despite it being inappropriate to do so.
This post is better suited for r/learnython and /r/learnprogramming 
I mean yeah if the office actually used discord then they could vote on where to go. I would have to make a few changes but overall shouldn't be that hard
&gt;Python isn't a first class functional language, so this makes sense What does this have to do with the syntax for function type annotations? I can't imagine a definition of "first class functional language" that Go satisifies better than Python and yet Go's function type syntax is much more pleasant \`func(int) string\`. &amp;#x200B; My larger grievances with Python's typing annotations are around defining generic functions. If I make a class with two generic methods, where do I define the typevar for each? And since TypeVars are defined in the same scope as the method definitions (as opposed to being scoped to the specific method where they're used) can I use the same typevar for both methods, or does that convey that they have the same type? What is the general relationship between a typevar's lexical scope and the evaluation of the type in the type system? I understand and appreciate the maintainers' desire to be conservative on syntax, but this is just one of many instances where Python's type annotation syntax just kinda sucks. I wonder if a TypeScript model of separating type annotations from the interpreter/vm might allow a sane syntax without impacting the interpreter maintainers. Sure, running a transpiler in CI isn't fun, but there's no reason it can't be fast and it's not like Python's build/deploy story is particularly simple anyway--a transpiler is a drop in the bucket.

&gt;How to improve my programming in research codes? &gt; &gt;My job is to implement machine learning algorithms and bring them to real-life projects. For example, I am working on a face verification project. Reading papers and implement the algorithms are not too difficult for me. But I find it challenge to design and implement a real-life projects with elegant codes:I don't know where to start. Do I need to follow the traditional procedure of software engineering such as general design, details design and classes graph?I don't know how to design the project. How many files should I created? Which class should be created in which file?I don't have a teacher currently. How should I improve? From the knowledge I obtain from the web, I should read and write more codes. But how?My current situation is I changed my codes quite often and I got stuck so frequently that I think it is quite inefficient. OK. So should I delete the post here?
&gt;How to improve my programming in research codes? The first community seems to not exist.
Why were they all removed? Just curious. Cheers
To your first question, that doesn't look particularly better than puthons syrax especially for nested callables. For your second, if both methods use the same generic types, the object should inherent from Generic. If the methods are just generic but not relatedly generic, then use individual typevars. They can all be the same, since typevars are evaluated per function or generic object only.

Nothing so exciting as AI. I currently only have duplicate image checking working. I'm ingesting every new post (all types, not just images) into a database. If it's an image I create a 64 bit difference hash and store it in the database. I then search a Vantage Point tree of all hashes for hashes that are within a certain hamming distance. If duplicates are found, are not cross posts and have difference users I flag the newest submission as a repost. Links will be easy to find duplicates of. Reddit hosted videos will be tricky. I haven't started down that road yet. The goal is to have several pieces of functionally. First, comment on reposts with stats about it. Second, allow people to summon the bot to get links to all other places the content has been seen. Third, provide an API where people can submit a Reddit link and find every place that content has been posted. The repo is up on Github. It's still super rough right now. Just started it on Sunday and I'm still hammering the structure out. https://github.com/barrycarey/RedditRepostSleuth

Agreed. I've been using PSG since before the Wx or Remi ports when it was just Tk and Qt. Since then it's grown so much and i've been able to master it really well. If you want a pythonic way to make a decent looking GUI in under 50 lines of code then PSG is a great choice. Within 50 lines of code you could have a multi functioning GUI.

Building a simple Twitter bot using [LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius), a neat library that lets me easily scrape lyrics from Genius. I scraped three Drake songs as a test, wrote a little script to clean up the data and slap it into a text file, and then another script to reply to people that Tweet "@captionsbydrake." Not sure how to make the replies automatic though-- I read about this nohup thing that might help.

Material science and system dynamics. Engineering school doesn’t leave much time for python. But once I graduate, oooooh you’re gonna get it python. You’ve got me all to yourself. 
Flask is so easy, it’s a godsend for making web apps. 
I'm automating scripts around events that have associated google calendars, so it's way less work than manually kicking things off. It's... a bit of a hack job. The concept is that it's periodically checking the associated google calendar to see what and when it needs to run stuff, then loading that into a scheduler. There'll be a config file to map event types to individual scripts.
I will be focusing exclusively on avoiding the polar vortex.

Machine learning!
Performance tuning a PDF analysis engine. It churns through 10's of thousands of PDF statements every hour. Uptime and processing costs are crucial. Performed benchmarks at the beginning of the week, set a target to hit and timeboxed through to Friday. Hit the target today with some low hanging fruit. Refactoring tomorrow with the aim of going above and beyond. If I get my next target tomorrow, I start on my next greenfield project for managing escalation alerts from New Relic.

Former HFT dabbler and satcom engineer here. Nanosecond delay was our optimization factor. Hardware optimized code (think compilers that unroll loops etc) with on-NIC deployment of trading logic to avoid CPU and OS round trip latency. Of course colocation is essential in this model. Milliseconds running elsewhere? Good luck with that and godspeed.
P.S. Now I remember why I couldn't implement the run-time type checking. It turns out, somewhat unintuitively, that type annotations can not be checked except in most trivial cases -- they simply do not match to Python run-time types. I can look up for reference if you are interested. Also mind that writing post-conditions would be cumbersome since you would need to distinguish between a pre and a post-condition. For example, imagine you pass in an object as the argument. Your function requires that a certain field is set to a range and ensures that another field will be non-None after the execution.
These are indeed cases where the overhead matters, I agree. As a side remark, I found contracts to be great for modelling database correctness (e.g., much more powerful than SQL checks). I just turn them on at test or debug time and turn them off in production. 
What do you want to talk about? If comment #2 is meta-discussion it seems like there's not a lot to be said. That's not to say sock-puppeting or astroturfing isn't a thing (or that either is happening here). But if you feel like the topic deserves more discussion, discuss it!

Why not use an API, like google news api or so. Why a web crawler? If I were you, I'd search in google and scrape the results.
Mostly on linux, but I'm kinda forced to use windows at work for one project. It's pretty painful experience as I always find myself lacking tools and not being able to customize my workflow as much as I can on linux. I feel like people that are happy with windows for programming in a language like python have not explored alternatives enough.
6 hours is a lot of time to ask of a prospective hire, and probably far time than you need to assess their skills. I'd say this is acceptable only if you're one of the top 10 tech companies... but then you wouldn't be coming here, would you? It's a waste of your time and theirs. Ask for some code they're proud of and get them to walk you through it. Mediocre people will show you something from an assignment they did in their coursework - in which you case you can spare yourself the boredom and bring the interview to a quicker and merciful end. People who steal code will struggle to explain their design decisions, because they didn't make those decisions. Good people will agonize over their choice (they have a lot to choose from) and settle on something simple and elegant, because they're used to being above average and are worried about losing someone on the interview panel by presenting something too complex. There's a few classic "assignment questions" that are very informative and quick: - Implement atoi(), or in Python terms, write a function that gives the numeric value of a string, using only the ord() function. This exposes candidates who don't fundamentally understand the difference between integers and strings. Some people do not seem to understand that `"123"` is not identical to `123`; their brains are weakly typed. - Write a recursive function that returns the highest value node in a binary tree (provide code for the node class). In about six lines of code you will discover how many candidates can't write a recursive function, which again, is a shocking number of people. - Twiddle some bits e.g. implement gray code or something. Lots of people don't get binary. You're looking for excellence in those questions. For atoi(), do they handle exceptions properly? Negative values? Values larger than int64? Good people ask for the full spec.

I read it as that they area recruitment company who has some junior devs already on their team, and they want to give them training tasks that take 6 hours, but those tasks need to be useful for their business practices.
Interesting. And they're still less known nearly two years later.
Some good ideas there. I actually have at least two purposes for asking. First I'm trying to hire developers in test. Normally we give an assignment over the weekend. If they are clearly more senior, however, we skip it. But maybe I need to rethink the approach entirely. I hadn't really thought about looking at their coursework. Second reason, we have internal people who want to transition to such a position, especially from manual QA, to this role. But I also had a Support guy ask me today. So I thought I'd give an assignment that they could do in one business day. Sorry I could have given more detail in my post, but I thought I would just ask, hey does X exist, and someone would say yeah go to this link. I'm not really clear on how common such exercises are.
I'm not sure what you mean. It seems to work for me &gt;&gt;&gt; print('a', 3, sep='-') a-3 &gt; tabs worked out better I also use tabs when I'm feeling lazy.

My condolences - that's a really tricky topic. On the upside, you'll know how IEEE754 floating point works in all languages because it's the same everywhere! If you want to torture yourself more, use [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) to test any functions you think you have nailed down. At least for me there's always a couple of edge cases, but it was a great way to learn!
`list` is the only builtin, but [`collections` is a standard library module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) so it's usually fair game.

I made this program and I want many people to use it and know "Turing pattern". 
Mate most of learning python will involve stack exchange or google. I suggest trying “install pip &lt;your operating system here&gt; tutorial” and watching YouTube videos. 
I think you have to install it outside python, and the way depends on the OS you use. 
I don't know what's the platform of your choice (Console on Win/Linux, web, PyGame or something?), and seeing that other people have already suggested Flask, here's another way. You could use [Pyinstaller](https://medium.com/dreamcatcher-its-blog/making-an-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-script-using-pyinstaller-d1df9170e263) or [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial) and use the [Github Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) feature to deliver these binaries for the Operating Systems you want. Make a nice README.md for your project, where you take credit, explain your design decisions, what you have learnt from this proejct, and advice people to not look at the source before playing the game to avoid spoiler. Then, feel free to post the game here ;)
In the command prompt/terminal. Also, /r/learnpython.
You have it already. It comes with python. Check out /r/learnpython 
What OS do you use?
I think it really depends on what your aim is here (as everyone else has already said). If its a generic programming task, you could look to codewars.com for inspiration of easy-hard problems to be solved. If there is a specific task you would like them to do or would like them to showcase a certain skillset, build something around this. I (working with ML + data science) have had technical tests where I am given a data set, and asked to "build a classifier and visualise" in which everything is basically left up to me. In this case there was then a follow up interview in which we discussed how i implemented things (OOP, jupyter notebook, libraries used, what I could have done better). This of course covered both programming aspects but also more technical - why did you use these methods, which other algorithms may have helped. If I could answer they knew that I knew it - if I couldnt then perhaps I blagged my way through.

Dude how many threads do you need to create?
That's the plan. It's not as straight forward as it sounds. Electron is basically a node.js app, but you can call subprocess and run Python files, and Django is just Python. Packaging part we're not 100% sure if it'll work, but we're going to try.
i know it's only a text file and i don't know how to use it with my code. It should open my input i typed in in my window in another window
Or jython that runs on the JVM
Too much `&gt; /dev/null` I suppose.
I was aware of it being EOL soon as it did, but for what it's worth, the site is internal-facing only and its functions are being supplanted by a different team's tools by the end of this year. We don't have the funding to overhaul it for the upgrade, but at least I can write some docs for the tools it does have. *shrug*
What terminates the server?
Putting the finishing touches to a Flask RESTful API (CRUD) that I wrote the other day, considering if I also should try and replicate it in Django for learning purposes. 
I'm confused on the question. Are you talking about an editor that indents blocks of code? 
Hi mate, If you are interested in making an instagram bot, check out the InstaPy library. Just search InstaPy on google and go to the GitHub. 
&gt;1. Outside of Pygame how much do you need to make a game? Hard to say, it really depends on the game. However, if you want to make a game during a Hackathon, you have to keep it down to basics only. You won't have time to implement non-essential features. &gt;2. If I wanted to go the phone app route then what would I need to know beforehand? Anyone can make an App with little to no knowledge. Making a great App however, does require quite a lot of background knowledge (and experience) in a lot of different fields (same goes for the previous question). In my experience, if you have to ask those questions, you're not equipped to do either gracefully. Not saying you shouldn't or you can't do it (go for it), I'm just saying you shouldn't expect a golden egg and be mentally prepared for the shock you will get (you will understand when you get there). Most important thing you can do is to *never give up*. Take plenty of small 5-10 minute breaks when you hit a wall. Getting away from the keyboard helps giving a different perspective. I know it's cheesy, but this is so true: *"The difference between a master and a student is, that the master has failed more times than the student has tried"*
Great, thank you. How would I get this working
I use C++ and Python and it depends on the scenario and the available tool, if i can use all the libraries i want and all the knowledge on the internet i'd give python the win. Python really shines with all it's easy to use libraries and a in general great documentation. C++ might produce better and faster programs, **but** finding libraries and using them is just a lot harder and takes tons of time. There's always horrible dependencies and problems compiling and setting up everything. So either i spend tons of time in C++ to get everything working or i will write my own "shitty" implementation of an algorithm. And my shitty implementation will not beat a optimized python library. So yeah python is great for producing decent code in a short time. If you give me time to think and work on a problem C++ wins. And if i am not allowed to use external libs than C++ wins because my shitty implementation on C++ will run faster than my shitty implementation in Python.

i had type safety in the original post.
I'm rewriting a few abominations that I did with django+drf+react. It was fun to learn some new things, but most imporant lesson for me was that I do not really need to split my code into two apps for backend and frontend. I don't love js and it was kind of a pain and totaly not worth all that. So, sorry for not sharing any codebase, I just wanted to pat myself on the back for returning to (almost) python :)
Wow, that looks very promising! Is that done all in kivy? or just integrating it well into another IDE? Either way that's awesome!
What I’d suggest. Is, create a function that reads the text file using myfile.read python function. Then store that in a variable. Something along the lines of: Myfile = open(“file.txt”) Content = myfile.read() Myfile.close() &lt;do something with the file here. I.e. print(content)... etc&gt;
Hi again mate, There is an exhaustive amount of documentation to be found on the GitHub page under the Table of Contents section, including an installation guide and coding examples! Good luck!
I'm working on transitioning to use the Parameter Store in AWS SSM, from the old style Lambda environment variables. 
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and consequently the Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler contained therein, have been evolving and improving for a LOT longer than Python. In addition, the threading and multitasking capabilities of Python can be hampered by the Global Interpreter Lock. The "maturity" of the JVM and JIT can often lead to bytecode performing BETTER than compiled C/C++ code for the native machine. Moreover, the newer [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) in conjunction with [SubstrateVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/README.md) are only going to increase the performance of JVM-based languages.
You genrally start with a 'state', which is an industry standard "TLE" (two line element) or a state vector of some kind, these are publicly available, then you need a propagator of some kind. There are various implementations of these, but my work has a few so I'll propagate a state vector into Lat/Long coordinates.
Also, you might try your Python benchmark using the [Graal Python](https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython) implementation and see how much improvement you get. Graal allows for implementing arbitrary language syntax using [Truffle](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle). Implementing a language syntax on Graal just requires writing an abstract syntax tree processor for said language. Because of this, [MANY](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/Languages.md) languages can now run via Graal (Python, JS, R, etc...) on the JVM and benefit from the JVM and JIT optimizations.
Taking your advice on this. Thanks

I'm open to suggestions and any ideas others might have to improve it!
I interviewed at Jane Street for FPGA developer role. They are running into problems with network cards being too slow and having too little bandwidth - so they are now trying to put the networking logic as well as some of the algorithmic logic on FPGAs to speed things up - possibly by a couple orders of magnitudes, since you can get rid of the processor and operating system out of the loop completely. Pretty technically interesting, but absolutely zero value added to society. They pay well though ;)
&gt;They pay well though This is why I worked in finance for so long. It gets old, though. I felt like the problems we were working in weren’t *real*. 
This is one of those questions that is so unusual that I suspect some [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). Rather than answer "how do I this" I will ask "What do you actually want to do?" 
**XY problem** The XY problem is a communication problem encountered in help desk and similar situations in which the real issue ("X") of the person asking for help is obscured, because instead of asking directly about issue X, they ask how to solve a secondary issue ("Y") which they believe will allow them to resolve issue X. However, resolving issue Y often does not resolve issue X, or is a poor way to resolve it, and the obscuring of the real issue and the introduction of the potentially strange secondary issue can lead to the person trying to help having unnecessary difficulties in communication and offering poor solutions. The XY problem is commonly encountered in technical support or customer service environments where the end user has attempted to solve the problem on their own, and misunderstands the real nature of the problem, believing that their real problem X has already been solved, except for some small detail Y in their solution. The inability of the support personnel to resolve their real problem or to understand the nature of their enquiry may cause the end user to become frustrated. The situation can make itself clear if the end user asks about some seemingly inane detail which is disconnected from any useful end goal. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

well i need to make a desktop app with a quite complicated gui but i hate PyQt i need a simple solution like windows forms in visual studio, the app does a lot of engineering calculations and python make them a lot easier, so all i'm asking is there a why to combine the 2 of them
does it support pip Numpy,Scipy,Sympy ... ? since i'm making an engineering desktop app

Everyone learns differently so find your style and learn that way. For some it’s YouTube videos, for others Udemy type classes, local community college (where you can interact and get help real time), or books. For me, it’s always been start at the problem and learn what I need to solve it. Like if I wanted to create a web based game, I’d just look up “how to create hangman in python” and “how to make Django games” etc. until I got all the pieces I needed to “solve the problem”. I’ve always found the best programmers are the ones who start with a passion for it and not someone merely chasing $$$. There’s a reason there’s a 60%+ dropout rate in computer science programs. 
Why do you need python at work? Is it work related? If you work for a “risk averse” company who only allow you to open office 365 and Skype then I’d challenge them as to why. People have been fired from my company using virtual box.

Thanks for your response. I think a part of my post was to find out from others that I'm not crazy for considering this change. Its always been a passion for me. I often wonder where I'd be if I never swapped majors but I'm trying my best not to dwell on that. 
Not a traditional game you see on here but, I finished my second game called Hungry Hungry Snails and a simple implementation: Here’s the writeup on the game itself https://github.com/GregHilston/Hungry-Hungry-Snails Here’s a simple solution: https://github.com/GregHilston/Hungry-Hungry-Snails/blob/master/example/app.py Essentially you control a worm and help guide it to find food, programmatically. This is more akin to a coding challenge but I actually wrote it with a game development in mind. My original thoughts were it'd be fun to have an RTS game, where the AI was written by the players and that's how this was born, as a prototype. This is my second game ever made and I'd love any and all feedback.
i will take a look at this when I get off work. Looking forward to it. :D

No, it’s not crazy. I’ve been a medic and a logistics planner but nothing has given me the satisfaction of make stuff just work like programming. 
I should have specified that since so much time has passed I forgot almost everything I learned and I'm starting over back at square one. Not to mention I have had no prior exposure to Python. Not sure what a programming competition even is outside of the obvious assumptions but I don't think I'd be ready for that just yet.
You say installing python module may break other program's environment? Then you should use virtualenv, which is python module to separate multi environments. 
Woah I'm really curious now, I'll tell you what I think when I've finished it :D
something like this? https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/C-and-Python-interprocess-171378ee

You are asking for c# integration for the sole purpose of a simple graphical editor? If so, I suggest to use remi GUI library https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi It has a graphical editor, here is an online preview http://remiguieditor--daviderosa.repl.co/ but I suggest to download it for a better usage. 
I'm very curious! will have to wait until I get to my Windows laptop :)
online preview keeps refreshing

Download it from GitHub and it will work fine.
I did not notice that, thank you.
Why 2.7 and not Python 3+ ?
Because if you actually use this in your code, your code will become more readable for PHP developers at the cost of being less readable to Python developers. You probably don't want that.
I seem to have found myself in a sushi restaurant with a waitress who is perpetually looking at me, then back at the menu on the table, then back at me. Nothing I say is breaking out of this loop.
Python is mostly about stitching things together and very little about algorithms / program architecture, so general questions seem to be rather pointless. To give you more concrete example: I work in tooling / automation. If a person can write udev rules, or parse tcpdump output, I'd hire them. If they are great at Django -- I don't care about them. In any case, a junior developer will not be expected to do any architecture: that's way above their paygrade / all those decisions have been already made anyways. And, if I cared about performance, I'd write in something other than Python, so I wouldn't look for a junior Python programmer. These days most programmers know one language, or one language plus JavaScript/CSS/HTML. So, if I had to invent a task for 6 hours, I'd ask them to write a daemon program that collects and displays statistics from OS. A SAR / `sadc` knock-off, just with less functionality.
Try [pythonnet](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet), it's more actively maintained than IronPython.
&gt; I'm 34 and trying to get back into programming. A friend gave me a book entitled "Learn Python the Hard Way". I just completed my Hello World lesson and I'm wondering if this self teaching approach is a good idea, or if anyone out there has a better idea or advice for me. Doable. Especially if you have the desire and an aptitude. I'm completely self taught for programming, and python is super popular in the world today. Try to get some work experience, and do well, and build on it. Don't be afraid to change jobs and reach for better things along the way as you build your new career.
No sweat and good luck!
Probably for the same reason my current project is in 2.7 - every time I've had to edit code at any of my jobs(including lately), it's been 2.7. I plan to make the switch after this project, but there's still 2.7 everywhere
The world will be a better place coming next year when Python 2 finally is no longer supported
What's wrong with chaining? That's the default, recommended way of performing multiple operations in pandas 
I finally switched to Python 3 when one of the packages I was using stopped supporting Python 2 in its latest release. The switch was generally surprisingly painless, but it just took something like that to give me the kick to finally do it.
You could make a C# app and then call a separate python program to do your calculations when whatever button is pressed. PyQt has a graphical form designer.
very morbid! well done. Would have liked a more lenient option selection (i.e Sushi != sushi) I'm extremely new to python but I made something like this once &gt; usr_oddeven = input("Choose odd or even!: ") &gt; if usr_oddeven in ["odd", "Odd" "not even", "od", "Od", "ood"]: this allowed my simple number generator to catch simple spelling mistakes
That's what I need. I'll definitely switch after this project. Glad to hear it was painless!
Not that I have a use for this at the moment, but I saw this trending on GitHub yesterday. Excellent work! Thanks for your time and contribution to the community. 
Probably an Old Spice ad.
Cleaning up code for my DNA encoded library helper, and creating 3d scatter plots for coworkers. My favourite so far: Pin plots with added point shadows.
Good job, look forward to playing
You could use something like .lower() or .casefold() so you don't have to write "odd" and "Odd" and even catch "NoT eVeN".
Stop your bloody shouting and bugger off.
Remind me not to piss you off at a restaurant ;) &amp;#x200B; Thanks for the feedback, I'll check it out. How far did you make it before the loop happened?
How old are you friend
i don't like it
Seriously, I like the builder pattern. I think it's particularly human readable.
Sounds like you should start with something more simple than pygame. 
I'll take a look at that, thanks for the input. &amp;#x200B; I didn't account for capital letters, BUT you can use variations and partials for most of the phrases.
16, I'm just annoyed
Started off with 2.7 and never made the switch.
I've pasted the entire text of that run here: https://pastebin.com/DhP9s9KH
Coding is super frustrating when you're first learning. I recommend checking out Code academy or even an online course. 
What do you recommend? I mean, I have like a handful of experiences with coding but only for that hour of code thing they do in schools
Okay.
I mean, the idea is that with all of the various modules you'll be using and downloading there's a chance that some won't play nice. That's why having each in their own little sandbox (virtual environment) is a good idea. Id say if you are comfortable debugging issues that arise from this, go nuts and don't use virtual environments. I don't and I've only ran into maybe two issues ever in my last two years of professional python development. 
Where would I put that in my code? usr_oddeven = input("Choose odd or even") if usr_oddeven in ["odd", "Odd", "not even", "od", "Od", "ood"]: output_list = [i+1 for i in range(int(usr_length)) if (i%2)==0] print(output_list) elif usr_oddeven in ["even", "Even", "not odd"]: output_list = [i+1 for i in range(int(usr_length)) if (i%2)!=0] print(output_list) else: print("input not recognised")
You could always use another ORM that may be more modest and better suited to the needs. I'm a fan of Peewee: http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/
There's a search app called "Everything" 
It's rejecting the salmon part of the input. Just "nigiri" will work. I'll get that fixed for the next version. Thank you.
This is also a [lab](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=lab_adventure) in Program Arcade Games which steps you through getting started.
No, there is a free tier on it.
oh okay good

I have been using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with the Ubuntu 18.04 image for the vast majority of my python development lately. I also use Sublime Text as my IDE and launch it via WSL using XMing as the display server. This part is not officially supported by Microsoft but works quite well (other than a small amount of UI lag).
I was just asking about making one lol
 I'm rewriting a few abominations that I did with django+drf+react. It was fun to learn some new things, but most imporant lesson for me was that I do not really need to split my code into two apps for backend and frontend. I don't love js and it was kind of a pain and totaly not worth it all that function wise. There are projects that would benefit from this approach, but, at least for now, I don't have these kind of projects. So, sorry for not sharing any codebase, I just wanted to pat myself on the back for returning to (almost) python :) 
I think you could even write usr_oddeven = input("Choose odd or even").casefold() So you'd only have to write .casefold() or .lower() once.
What do you want to do with it?
It is probably not working. Here is the image==&gt; [https://imgur.com/a/AixDml5](https://imgur.com/a/AixDml5)

Really cool! One of our users created &amp; deployed a different interactive airline web-app using bokeh (running here: [https://data-apps-bphdkrcy0d-8000.cloud.kyso.io/airlines](https://data-apps-bphdkrcy0d-8000.cloud.kyso.io/airlines)). Would love to see if you could deploy yours on Kyso too.
Why can’t you use PyCharm? It’s the best IDE in my opinion. 
From all the different IDEs I've tried, I always return to PyCharm. Silly policy that you can't use it.
Unfortunately, nothing comes close to PyCharm. You could build an acceptable dev platform based on something simpler like Sublime + Atom, but it will never have quite the same convenience.
Sorry, I forgot - Eclipse + PyDev is an alternative. I've not used it in 3 years, but I know it is still under active development. 
I would love to know a) how you did in the code, would you share some? and b) how you packaged it! &amp;#x200B; I thought about doing a text based game, but I'm a beginner, and it seemed super hard. But that's probably because I'm a beginner. 
Yeah, I made my full switch after Django.
Yup, that's exactly what did it for me!
Me likey Flask.
Did you see that one that was just submitted to this sub? Here's a wiki link for the zork engine, btw, for the lazy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine
No, but studying it is a fun lesson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine
I made it to the true end. Your storytelling is pretty good, but gameplaywise all the surprising dead ends were a bit frustrating. I also think that you shouldn't give the user an input prompt if what they type is going to be ignored.
Don't try to bring a heavy operation just so you can use the progress bar. If you need one in order to develop/test the progress bar, use a mock - a program that just sleeps for however long you want it take.
Which languages homework?
We use an online tool called language perfect, Andy bot learbs the translations and gets it right afterwards 99% of the time
Or using fuzzy matching (fuzzywuzzy makes this very easy), then you don't need any exact matches. You could print the closest option with a y/n prompt. Very cool though 
Nice. Not sure what you mean by this. Care to explain?
Yes I know it is the best, it's what I currently use, but they are taking it away in about a month. Hence I need to find a replacement.
Yes I know it sucks. Any other options?
he doesn't want no " TEXT ON A WHITE SCREEN"
Oh, I know that. I would only bring in a command that was heavy if it was useful. I just want one that is really useful, but it takes time if you know what I mean.
I think the biggest problem is the extreme difference between how the object system is implemented in C and what it is exposes to the Python layer. The solution to this seems so easy: add *all* functionally to PyTypeObject slots, and resolve the conflicts that currently make a whole bunch of methods map two multiple slots. If every dunder mapped to a single type slot and has a concrete definition of its behavior abc becomes useless as all that is needed is an &amp; operation. Right now when an object defines __add__ there is no way for to know if that means integer addition or sequence concatenation so both tp_as_sequence.sq_concat and tp_as_number.nb_add slots are filled. This distinction already exists in the operator module and abstract api: `__concat__` is for sequences , uses a different implementation than `add` that's obviously faster.. Other easy to solve conflicts are __mul__ which maps to sq_repeat/nb_multiply, __setitem__ as mp_ass_subscript/sq_ass_item, __len__ as mp_length/sq_length. sq_repeat sould be called something like... __repeat__. slicing differentiation could be brought back as __setslice__/__getslice__ (those slots are still there). Rename mapping subscript operators to __getkey__, __setkey__ etc. And __missing__ should be in tp_as_mapping and work with PyObject_GetItem. Actually the interview dict interface should be added. `get` is a ternary function that looks for a key and returns a default value instead of propagating KeyError. It's so obvious but that solution could never be implemented as it would completely trash backwards compatability which will never happen again even on a major version change. Until the backwards compatability restrictions are relaxed we're stuck with the horribly inefficient and inaccurate __subclasshook__, __isinstance__ manually-forced-to-explictly-specify-the-abstract-type-for-hundreds-of-types system.
I like how you kill waitress only when you can't die.
Ah man, not Mac-compatible? :( 
You can use [SQLAlchemy Core](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/index.html) as a SQL generator, without the SQLAlchemy ORM. Instead of defining models, you just define tables and bind them to DB engines, and execute queries like c = table.columns rows = table.select([c.col1, c.col2]).where(c.col3 == 'value').execute() for r in rows: print(r['col1']) Queries can get *much* more complex, and the API is quite complete, including dialects for PostgreSQL &amp;c. that implement the features specific to those DBMSes.
The convention in text adventure games is that if you see the input prompt ("&gt;") then that means that the player needs to enter in a command. You use it for that, but you also use it for the case where you just want the player to press enter to see the next line of text. Or, in other words, if you aren't going to do anything with what the player types after the prompt, then you shouldn't be showing the prompt.
Or it will be a worse place because everyone will use an unsupported Python version.

If "they're taking it away" = the company stops their licensing but doesn't forbid using whatever software you want, you could get a personal license.

I see. Thank you.
For me it was a slow half-time student path of 3.5 years, then landed an internship @15$/hr, 10 months later hired FTE as front end dev. I could NOT have taught myself, because i am easily distracted. And every project I ever made for school was related to /r/DnD, Nasa, or MTG. By having projects (even ones that never were 'good') that are in areas I am hobby level interested helped me keep focused. Good Luck. Have Fun.
I don't need a program to do that for me, I just follow /r/wallstreetbets advice
find a place to work that respects its employee's time and sanity
install anaconda or miniconda
The reality is: 1. people will still be working on "legacy" systems which have no intention of upgrading despite the lack of support 2. any project that's _still_ using a python 2.x this year right now is already in trouble unless it's super simple and can be upgraded
I recommend using sockets -- you can have the python code act like a socket server and get commands from a client using the localhost address. That way, you can write the GUI in any language and just have it communicate with the python code over the socket connection. You can test the python code without even writing any GUI, just use Putty to connect to it and send commands. It also allows you to port the GUI to a mobile app or run it remotely if needed. There are lots of python examples (the official docs on sockets include some). I've done this on several projects and it's worked so well that it's become my standard way to structure an app.

Thanks so much for sharing. Did you attend a community college? And was this post-bach education? Did you obtain a degree or just take the classes you needed to gain the programming knowledge. I ask because I'm not sure I could slide right back into the calculus classes very easily. It's been so long since I've been exposed to that type of mathematics.
1. I absolutely don't give a shit about those people and systems. What I care about are improvements to the language without being dragged down by compatibility and support for long deprecated stuff. If they want to continue with Python 2 they're free to fork (off) 2. Rightfully so, they should've upgraded long ago. What bugs me is people still teaching Python 2 or kids thinking "hmm should I learn Python 2 or Python 3?".

Our system required that auth be stateless, so we went with JWT for auth. You can read about it here: [https://auth0.com/docs/jwt](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) Probably already some Python JWT modules out there.

Got wife, and children, prettier organic way to lose money
\&gt; I have a long history of writing web applications with Flask, so much so that I think I’ve lost count of them by now - at least 15, if not 20. &amp;#x200B; the gist of it... familiarity.
Especially because of the F string format &lt;3
Especially because he's using stuff that's been deprecated for 10 years and won't work next year :D but yes, f-strings are &lt;3
Thanks for the link. I was also looking into JWT. Saw some articles also mention that they included the user in the JTW token an user id. I still found it kinda vague how the other servers will authenticate the token and user. &amp;#x200B; Are you decoding the token on each server and check if the signature is verified and then use the user id included in the token? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Why does everyone need to use the same tool? The 4 devs in my team use pycharm, vim, sublime text, and VS code. Stick a `.editorconfig` in your repo, run a linter in CI and the tooling doesn't matter.
Is this the new copycat of Medium? Both incorrect and long-winded. Tldr (bold corrections) You can create your own immutable objects so long as any single-level-deep data will not change, but builtin examples include tuples, numbers, strings, frozen sets, and more. **Immutablity and hashability are unrelated.** **An immutable object doesn't have to be hashable.** **A hashable object doesn't have to be immutable.** **Usually**, deeply immutable objects (such that all elements recursively are also immutable) are hashable. Anything that is **hashable** is useful as a cache key.
Not having written one: I think it's mostly `input` and if statements
***Cough Cough*** *linux*
If they're taking away Pro, can you use Community?
You can still use the free version? It does pretty much everything you need for day to day.
I agree; you shouldn't force a developer to use a specific IDE. Honestly, I've tried many over the years and nothing compares to Pycharm.
..... That title is fawesome.
&gt; Unfortunately, that won't work for my company laptop. If you say so. &gt; Plus then my entire software team would need to do that and that's just not feasible. Unless the point is to standardise across the board, then no? I'm pretty much the only pycharm user where I work. It even supports editorconfig for basic cross-editor configuration.
No linux :(
Don't suppose you have some handy code for this? I assume like OP, I'd probably have just used input.

It's not a code thing. I'm suggesting that the story shouldn't be fed to the player line-by-line, with them having to press enter between each one.

Ah, gotcha. Man. HGttG takes me back. Thanks foe the link.
nothing wrong with VBA imo, it's shares excels DNA. if it's badly written, any language is shit.
I love pycharm as much as everybody else here, but I am really disappointed by the fact that one must have separate applications to handle different languages. I work daily with python, C and C++. Support is poor for C languages with pycharm. 
Yeah, the writer just doesn't know Django and is familiar with Flask. That's fine, and is what we all do, but he makes claims about Django that are not true or at least not as important as he seems to think.
I'm pretty sure he was asking about the Insert key.
Just so you know, intellij ultimate integrates all of their "single language" ides".. PyCharm is nice b/c it has a free version, but generally those single language ides are to simplify your ide when you only use a particular language. &amp;#x200B; If you use a variety of languages frequently, like javascript, java, python, and so on - you should try the full on intellij ultimate ide.
This is gold .
[ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) satisfies all my needs. Would that work for you?
Now that sounds interesting! 
This is kind of pedantic, though. It was clear from reading the article that his point was that if you have an immutable object, then you can create an immutable hash value for it and use it where hashable objects are used. Of course you could do this with arbitrary hash functions that change, but you probably shouldn't.

You maintain your license after you stop paying. I don't recall the exact rule but it's something like "you revert to a perpetual licence for the version as it was when you bought it".
Thanks! Don't be sorry, it gives me an excuse to buy more parts and build new things! 
did you 3d print the plastic case the board is in?
Seriously - hard to believe companies can be this dumb. License for pro work is $200/year. That's like 4 hours worth of a developer's salary. Silly to spend $100k+/year on a developer but then refuse the extra $200 to give them tools to make them more efficient.
Yeah, I had a few friends print different things I found on [Thingiverse.com](https://Thingiverse.com). The light ring didn't fit any of them exactly, but I was able to use parts from all the different projects to build something still resembling an arc reactor.
Pythonanywhere is quite good. I teach python with it, and find it to be quite a bit better than IDLE for beginners. The only thing you can't really do with it is TK or other GUI interfaces. PythonAnywhere is running linux, so it's really what you're trying to do with your windows machine. Python works great on linux. Most linux distros already have the python interpreter installed, but you may still want to upgrade and tweak. Not sure about power management issues. If you want to use a remote machine, I think it's better to use one set up to do so rather than trying to do your own. I honestly think using something like Pythonanywhere could solve your problems, or you can look into some other online system like this one at tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_python_ide.php Finally, winPython (http://winpython.github.io/ ) is a portable python version you can run directly from a USB with no installation. It comes with IDLE and some other tools, but I haven't used it myself.

awesome info. I will be looking into that
But note that although not yet production ready work is being done on [https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3)
Your assignment only asks for the number of seconds as input, not the hours or days or minutes. Tip: use constants in your conversion. Use modulo operator as well. 
You're converting a string to a string. Also, read the GOD DAMN SIDEBAR r/learnpython

&gt; Is this the new copycat of Medium? I think Threader just "compiles" Twitter threads, which is where I saw this first: https://twitter.com/1st1/status/1090325242432630784
Gotcha, that makes sense now. I really appreciate the help. 
Not trying to be that guy but you start with Part 1. Writing out the flowchart will help you to visualize what logic your program should be following. 
Why are you looking for a good tool when you already have one? You should have a serious chat with whoever's in charge of this choice. Employee productivity trumps whatever paltry savings they are thinking they will get. If you waste half an hour per day by using a subpar tool, multiply that by the number of people in your team (assume 10), multiply that by 5 days a week, 49-50 weeks a year, ±35$ per hour = roughly 40K (or way more according to employee salary). 
&gt; It was clear from reading the article that his point was that if you have an immutable object, then you can create an immutable hash value for it and use it where hashable objects are used. But this ***isn't true***. A tuple is immutable, but if it contains a mutable object such as a list, set, or dict, it is not hashable. The reverse is also true-- any class deriving from `object` is hashable (unless `__hash__` is overwritten in the MRO), but unless written such that all attributes can't be set nor deleted after object initialization, it is mutable. Of course, generally the subtleties don't matter, but for the 1/10 times that they do, people get screwed over. This is why I hate articles like this (either having a base of knowledge or bullshit and sprinkling the other in). It leads to confusion and cognitive dissonance down the road. Learn it once, not 3 times each time correcting a subtlety. It's the same problem with having an ["understanding of C" and a "deep understanding of C"](https://www.slideshare.net/olvemaudal/deep-c). It leaves people out in the rain and screws them over not to go over the nuances. Fuck it, mark them as notes or parentheticals so that the people who just need a super brief understanding can skip them, but you should still include the notes. Hell even the "deep C" in the presentation I linked has some errors and missed nuances, but I give that a pass to an extent because those are extreme nuances (while ANSI C has the return code as a garbage value and above mark a lack as success, many compilers will still not clear the register and you'll get the return value of printf or some other function within it).
How in the world has a twitter thread of all things become an appropriate medium to teach programming concepts!?
Do you just want to make a game? Tbh, don't bother with python. I love python to death but if you just wanna hash out a game id just use a game engine like GameMaker or something. After you prototype it, then maybe consider making a better version in Java or something. Python is a little bit slow for games out of the box but it can be done. There's nothing wrong with using an existing engine to churn out a game though. No sense in reinventing the wheel, right? 
pip is kinda broken for me, but assuming it is installed correctly, you can type your python command -m pip install for an installation. Ex. python3 -m pip install pygame Then if you run a python file using python3 it will work with that install of pygame. This is all in your cmd as well. Thats the terminal for linux and command prompt for windows. Try running the command python, it should say python 3.6 or something, then have some &gt;&gt;&gt; for input, and then type import pygame I would also make sure python is installed correctly as im pretty sure pygame is with the default install. 
Love it, great work 
Not sure about OP's exact situation, but let's just say that some companies might be doing this for reasons other than cost. :(
Thanks :) 
Intellij includes all the languages. It costs more
