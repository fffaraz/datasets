Disregard, looks like I need to add "return inventory" at the end of the function...
You mean 4 frames of input to the DQN. What I'm curious about is how many (thousands, millions) of gameplay frames before it's capable of reaching a score above 0

Your methodology sucks. You should always gather data before trying to find a conclusion.
I released my first PyPI package. [https://pypi.org/project/Dictabase/](https://pypi.org/project/Dictabase/) &amp;#x200B; It's a database interface that acts like a normal python dict. I would love your feedback. I have never released anything this public, so I would love to hear how I can improve. Thanks
Of all the good reasons to learn python, being spammed at is non-existing.
Would you mind including a short description so one does not need to click away to figure out what it is?
r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; but your problem is the field is called 'install\_requires' and not 'packages'.
It looks like you are trying to run a gui app on remote system through ssh opened in subprocess. Well, I dont know what exactly is happening here (didnt try it myslef this way) but I know it will not work. My solution would be to run `ffmpeg` on the remote system to send the video to local system (as a network stream). Then run the gui app accessing the stream on the local system.
Is it important that it is growing *fast* or that it is growing *fastest?*
I've already posted about Cliar here on r/python three years ago. The docs were poor, there were uncovered cases and critical bugs, there were no tests at all, and the reception was very cold. &amp;#x200B; Now, the package has decent docs, 100% test coverage, more features, and better flexibility with the created CLIs. &amp;#x200B; Cliar is a solo project of mine, and I am quite happy with how it turned out. It would be great if somebody else found it useful. I personally like it better than Click or docopt or anything else I tried. Feel free to give it a shot, share feedback, report issues, and contribute!
&gt;Because freelancers are generally not going to maintain your code, and code generally doesn't get written to be used once and then thrown away. once a coder finishes to write the app for the company, then what is he paid for? Mantain code? To do nothing?

Implementing new features. Fixing bugs. Adjusting for changes in internal processes, external services or laws. Providing support to users. Lots of things, really. Software is never "finished".
You talk about the successor? English isn't my mother tongue. Mind telling me what about it made you chuckle?
You need `setup(install_requires=['requests'])`.

I may only mention the use of python in the lab report, the only similar thing done was by using Matlab which you have to pay to use. I should have clarified that this information will be on the presentation that I give to my classmates on the rotation itself and not the report. I'll definitely mention the community, because it is what helped me the most with my development.
Google
Check poetry: https://poetry.eustace.io/ This is the best python dependency manager that I ever saw.
This looks really quite well done, congrats, I remember it from before and thought then it was a neat idea, now it looks even more polished. I've got a lot of code invested in click, and kinda need the type of flexibility it offers (as well as Python 2 support), but might very well try cliar out on a new project that has a more standard cli setup then my current one. Overall, this seems like it occupies a space somewhere between python fire and click. Always good to have options!
The python coockbook. Yea sounds like an interesting read.
This should be asked on /r/learnpython. There are a few commonly used tools today, but there's nothing wrong with using a requirements file. Note that docker, while often useful for development, is not a comparable tool to pipenv or similar tools at all.
Most web frameworks come with their own testing tools. Why not use those?
1. /r/learnpython 2. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_variable_is_one_of_two_choices.3F
oh sorry. i didnt know this was the wrong subreddit.
You should indent your code, if the code is entered like this then it is a mess and is the reason you cannot spot you errors.
Hola! Yo te puedo contar desde mi experiencia cursando en Acámica. Hasta donde voy es una carrera bastante completa y vas a estar viendo MatplotLib y Seaborn que son para visualizar, pero eso es solamente una parte de todo lo que he llegado a aprender en estos dos meses. Doy fe de que las herramientas sirven para hacer proyectos grandes y aprender a implementar en mi laburo. Lo que si es diferente (en relación a lo que buscas) es que enseñan con Python.
1. Ask this kind of question to r/learnpython (bot will coming soon :)) 2. Format you code, read on r/learnpython rules, thay explain how to do it 3. Your if statements is broken here is why if game == "Dice roll" or "dice roll" : ... This statement is always evaluate as `True` because "dice roll" always return `True`. What you want to do instead is. If game in ["Dice roll", "dice roll"] : ...
yea sorry, i didnt know. also thanks
Pretty good but remove the clicking noises whenever you click it's really distracting
The == expressions aren't written correctly, and they don't do what you think they do. You need to write: If menu_choice == 'Play' or menu_choice == 'play' The more important thing, though, is to learn why. I don't have time to type a helpful answer, but Google "truthiness" or "Truthy" / "Falsey." It's very unintuitive (or so it seemed to me when I started learning about it).
This should be post here r/learnpython as you ask for comment on it. You should separate user input, writing to the file and calculus on several functions. In this way you will have a cleaner code with less repetition. For exemple you can ask the user for all informations and then pass input variables one time to the function that will write it down in the file. Don't forget also to add docstring, and take the habit to use a repository such as github, gitlab or bitbucket to write your script. Finally, always test your code.
Rule 34 !!!
I started from a couple of YouTube videos to get an idea of what I wanted to do but the main one that helped me though, and that I found the most constructive, was this chap who did a bunch of videos to build a top-down game. With an isometric game I guess you'll be wanting some animation too and there's a good number of videos on YouTube for this as well. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UxnelT9aCo&amp;t=496s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UxnelT9aCo&amp;t=496s)
Thanks for the advice next time will post to learnpython. I did test it and it seemed to work alright.
I made a python script that opens a blank file, writes "if __name__ == '__main__': print('hello world!')", saves it as hello_world.py, then runs that script :) It's a simple example but still, I think I'm funny lol
I am for unit testing. I'm using flasks unit test framework. But tavern is more of an integration test.
You could use the same thing for integration tests though? Like, it's not really different from what Tavern does.
Done. Thanks for pointing that out.
flasks+pytests testing facility isn't at the level of abstraction of standing up a full server (including psossibly building a docker container), barraging it from the outside, etc. Flask provides a mock server for unit testing and my units use that. This seems possible with tox+tavern, but I just thought there might have been a more complete project than tavern that does this.
What do you mean by "full server", exactly? Are you trying to spin up the exact same environment you'd run in production?
I had the same issue. I used the haversine system to calculate the distance with latitude and longitude. There is a module for Python called haversine. \`py -m pip install haversine\`
This is great, thanks a bunch!
For example, a docker compose file containing the dockerized server and its dependencies. This is a step above unit testing. Tavern leaves actual teardown and startup to the user: I was only wondering if there were a package that does it all. If not, fine, I have to use tox and tavern.
Thank you very much for the update. And apologies for asking this Can you please provide a mini-example using a dataset that has missing years For example: years 1990 to 2000 for 10 countries with attributes like gdp and lifeExp. but some countries are missing some years. Will the animation still work ? I will use the gapminder dataset and remove some entries(rows) for some countries and test. &amp;#x200B; Tha

~into~ from
Line 25 under indented..?
You need to activate windows Also press tab to create an indent on a new line after an if statement. They should all be in line in your code. The ifs and else's but they are not
Also, you keep instantiating variables with a type.. ie "x = int" You don't have to do that. Python isn't a strictly typed language.

/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
If you enter a parameter without a keyword it needs to go first- better to just use all keywords (I.e. def myfunc(p=3, l=2). Etc instead of def myfunc(3, I=2)
What it says, you have a keyword arg ('sep') before a non-keyword. Try swapping "rape" and 'sep="/"'.
1: you're posting in the wrong sub - /r/learnpython. read the sidebar when you get there. 2: you're posting a picture of code. 3: you're not reading the error message. 4: you indented where you shouldn't have.
Planning to buy this, do you guys recommend it?
Check out libtcod as well if you're looking for a solid tile-based, 2d library.
Also curious about this. I understand a lot of HB coding bundles are sort of tossed together, but AI and deep learning are topics of professional interest for me, so I’m definitely curious about this bundle in particular.
This is quite cool. Quite cool, indeed
This looks cool, I’m excited to rewrite some things to use this. Thanks for authoring it and sharing here! How would I handle global options though? Like this: command.py --global-option-1 subcommand --subcommandoption I took a look at the source and I didn’t see anything that would handle that. I would also like the ability to specify some options explicitly and without dashes, like this: command.py subcommand subcommandoption=value This second request is to support backwards compatibility with an existing CLI. I’m happy to submit PRs if you have opinions on how this should be implemented.
Thank you very much

Unless data is an object that has the attribute text you can’t do data.text() like that. Maybe try to test it as a string by using isinstance(data, str) to test if it’s a string? What is the data type of data?
not yet, but the same guy who paid at the firts time ordered some more automation
Wow. I am planning to find some people too, but I just can't find someone.
Yeah but asking "how many frames did you train" is a meaningless question because the answer is *as many as each generation could*
Cool, seems pretty useful actually

No? Any paper about reinforcement learning will show graphs where the X axis is frame count and Y axis is level of play per game. You very quickly can see that 3million frames of training will get you to 110% of human ability at X game, for example.
Neat

Packt books usually are not very good. But probably I wasn't lucky.
Yes. Abaqus has a python interface, so I've got some code that can load results files, make some plots, take some pictures, make a movie, and kick off the gui to run the script. I've got other scripting tool writers for Tecplot and Patran.
You just miss private classes. I say, who needs ‘em?
Hmm. I have a ten dollar credit at Udemy. That course looks good. Thanks for the summary!

Not entirely sure this applies but there’s also [intel’s python distribution ](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python/documentation/get-started).
If it’s Packt, you can easily skip it. I’ve seen some of their “books” be basically print formatted copies of online docs already out there. Trash publisher

Thank you for the kind words! &gt; How would I handle global options though? Like this: &gt; &gt; command.py --global-option-1 subcommand --subcommandoption You cannot do that now, unfortunately :-( In Cliar, the root command is just like a regular command but with an empty name. Your snippet is calling \`subcommand\` command, which has \`--subcommandoption\` flag; the root command is not called, so its \`--global-option-1\` flag is disregarded. You could workaround the issue by declaring \`--global-option-1\` for \`subcommand\`, but you would have to put it after \`subcommand\` when calling the app. I thought about supporting arg inheritance (\[argparse allows it\]( [https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#parents](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#parents))), but couldn't find nice way to add it without complicating the API. However, this was a long time ago, and I might give it another shot. Please file an issue so that this problem is not lost. &gt; I would also like the ability to specify some options explicitly and without dashes, like this: &gt; &gt; command.py subcommand subcommandoption=value Is it a valid syntax? I'm not sure argparse supports it. You could implement it by having `subcommandoption` be a required arg and writing somthing like `subcommandoption = subcommandoption.split("=")[-1] if "=" in subcommandoption else subcommandoption`.
Haha cool, I made a local version of a game like this back in the days at school with TurboPascal, I called it FireFight :D now come on redditors get the server up I'm up for some games!
Thanks! Would you mind if I ask what the critical features in Click that are missing in Cliar are? Except for Python 2 support, this is not going to happen in Cliar, unfortunately,

IMHO this is the best method def increment(x): return sum([1]*x+[1]) I use it all the time.
aww, Python doesn't curse anyone..
From a glance it looks very similar to Google's [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) but I really like type hints as a way to enforce and customize arguments: def read_from_file(input_file: open): lines = input_file.readlines() This looks very convenient!
Good old days... :D A public server would be really nice indeed!
There is an open issue on YouTrack from 2017 ([https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-24193](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-24193)) but it doesn't seem to have been fixed yet. &amp;#x200B; One suggested workaround to enter a SPACE before pressing ENTER, but you'll then need to strip trailing spaces from the input (that said, you may want to do that anyway)
I did both too, and to be honest, I kind of wanted to be a little bit of a purist and only use Vim Buffers, but I cycle with TAB and Shift-TAB in basically every editor and only gVim can handle Shift plus modifier keys :(
Exactly.

Sure. Python 2 support will become less important over time, but for now I still need it. Python 3.5 will be important to me for quite a while still, though. Just too many Debian Stretch machines out there for the foreseeable future. &amp;#x200B; The thing I'm working on at the moment is probably not your typical use-case anyway. It's a sort of engine that dynamically creates sub-commands (and whole cli-applications, for that matter) out of yaml/json files (and other things like jinja-templates, images, database-rows, etc -- but that's too weird to explain here :-) ). &amp;#x200B; Click is well laid-out, and lets me hook into its processing pipeline in a very fine-grained way, and I can construct the list of parameters that control the parsing on the fly out of my source-metadata (I'm not using the Click-decorators at all). If I used Cliar, I probably would have to create a lot of intermittent Classes dynamically. Which I'm not opposed to in general, but it would be a whole different design. &amp;#x200B; Then, some arguments need to be processed before others, some before the 'main' parsing even begins, some should not be parsed at all but forwarded to whatever the result of the 'main' parsing process is. &amp;#x200B; Same with constructing the cli help messages, and validation, Click lets me adjust that sort of behavior relatively easy (coercing user input into a different type, password prompt-callbacks, dynamically creating argument help, stuff like that). I'm also using stevedore and setup.py-entrypoints to enable plugin-functionality for sub-commands. That part might have been easier with Cliar though, not sure. &amp;#x200B; I haven't looked into Cliar in too much detail, so it's possible it could do all this stuff equally well as Click. But, as I said, there's just too much code already, so it wouldn't be worth it. Plus, Python 3.5....
The one that keeps spam out of /r/Python of course.
It is possible by not having a broken MVC. If you need to physically send events to the UI in order to test your code, you are doing modern MVC wrong.
I'm posting here as I'd like to try a new approach and get into something new. Also there are some issues with events as the testing framework will be stuck to one technology only and in practice the user clicks around and does himself not invoke events.

Hi jjjjj
I really just want a simple code (not homework)
I've been building _a lot_ of command line interface and I feel that global flags and inheritence become really important features down the line. I mostly use `click` and the it allows you to pass around context object which is kinda ugly but once you get used to it it's rather fine. Maybe `cliar` could support something like that?
The important question is which code editor is the best.

Essentially, what this does is give you a way to take the whole integer division of the total inches for this conversion (div) and the remainder part for the remaining inches (mod) and returns them as a tuple. ``` meters = 3 # whatever you want here print(divmod(meters * 3.28084 * 12, 12)) # result: (9.0, 10.110240000000005), or 9' 10.11" ```
No fast.ai? It's not 100% focused on cv, but takes you through some of latest state of the art methods.
I have to agree. "R is one of the oldest blah blah 1995." Uh... Mathematica (1988) and SAS (1976) would like a word. It got worse from there.
I'm on the Sourcetrail team, currently working on the Python extension (not yet released). So basically this will be a tool that reads any Python code and displays an interactive dependency graph where you can click on a function definition and see all the contexts where the function may be used (ofc. you can also click variables or types). For language analysis I am using [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi). Here's the repo: [https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailPythonIndexer](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailPythonIndexer) What do you think?
So you mean using numpy arrays? How can they help me get stuff done faster?
I like to keep it simple and go with standard library. https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request
You can look at unitest or pytest, you will see what I mean by test. Also, it's good first start, python is really powerful tool, have good knowledge on it will help you a lot for many things.

downloading and thanks
I even starred it at one point and forgot all about it. Thank man, it's great.
Have pirated softcopy, need to buy the hard copies. Weird who you never end up reading pirated academic books.

Planning to write a module this weekend. Guess this is where I'll start.
&gt;Lots of people think that they can use both the programming languages at the same time. But we should prevent to use them at the same time. Majority of people are using only one of these programming languages. They should probably start with English.

Very cool. I'm new to Python, so seeing these kinds of applications is always great!
Sorry it took a while, not been at work till today and I'm lazy. Not python either because I'm working on some infra stuff right now. http://i.imgur.com/l7rZv2K.png

Thanks for the feedback! Sure, Cliar cannot compete with Click for such specific and complex usecases as yours. I'd pick Click if I were you, too :-)
Please see my previous comment. Currently, there's no way to have global params passed to subcommands. But I'm definitely hooked on the topic now since it's already the second comment about it.
Question, how do people keep up with this deluge of information?
https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Glad to hear :). What do you do for a living?
Currently just a lowly Comp Sci student. Currently working in C++. I have an internship coming up and figured it was a good excuse to learn Python.
Here are (free) Coursera courses Part 1: https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1 Part 2: https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2
Nothing lowly about that! Python is a beautiful language. Hope you enjoy stepping into it. Hope the internship goes well. If you have any questions about PyMedPhys feel free to ask :).
I actually have an interview on computer vision this thursday, can anyone recommend me how to prepare for it?
This is what I did to install python 3.7.3 on Debian Stretch: https://gist.github.com/robfraz/825eaac60d93ead884d2ee081d36f54f Whilst I wouldn't advise running it directly, it'll give you some inspiration. You can see on line 46 I'm installing the dependencies for zlib to work, which is the cause of the problem you're currently having.

Thanks for taking the time to do this!
1 - You probably need `zlib1g-dev` &gt;sudo apt update &gt;sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget should probably get that sorted. 2 - `make uninstall` or `sudo make uninstall` in the directory you installed from should uninstall it. 3 - have you tried pyenv? https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation - never used it on ubuntu, but it works very well on MacOS for managing installations and creating venvs (using the `pyenv-virtualenv` plugin)
which knowledge?
In other regards, I'd probably recommend you use pyenv, which is a way of nicely controlling various Python installs on your system. https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
I’m fairly new to Linux, but since the official repos don’t have 3.7.3, I believe your options are to build it from source, or to add the deadsnakes ppa to your system and install it that way. I prefer adding the PPA, but I know many people don’t trust 3rd party repos. Building from source isn’t hard and doesn’t take long either. The only downside I can think of is that you don’t get automatic updates with that method, but you do with the PPA. Anyway, here is a link to the PPA if you are interested: https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa To install: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa sudo apt update sudo apt install python3.7 python3.7-venv python3-pip Hopefully I got the above formatting right! Good luck!
During these meetings, there is always interesting discussion about e.g. coding practices, advanced paradigms (e.g. async). From my experience, the actual level of python coding in companies is not more advanced than chaotic scripting.
Will any of these teach me to make a phone app that can find a pickle hanging on a Christmas tree in real-time?
Thanks
I honestly haven't given much attention to Fast AI but it's on PaperSpace so I'll give it a try
Do you have the job specs? Not all CV work is the same, some can be more low level focuses using OpenCV and C++. Others can be pure Deep Learning classifier types (Do Rajeev's Udemy course in that case) or some can be more on Object Detection.
ah I see. yeah, all my professional python work has been solo with multiple front enders consuming it, but everywhere that i've worked on a team the code has been chaotic regardless of the language used.
No worries, I'm learning a lot of business analytics and traditional data science as well by doing similar type courses, I'll post a review of those in a few short weeks.
Well maybe not a phone app running natively but I believe Rajeev's course and PyImage do show you how to build your own object detectors. Rajeev's YOLO tutorial was decent and easy enough to follow.
Hi? Lol
Cool give it shot.
Thanks for your reply. your answer to my second question is not working if i am doing it the right way as you said. Well i don't know where is my python3.7 installed. But i did `type python3.7` to know the directory and also i know that most of all the files are in usr/local/lib . But still don't know how to uninstall it. Please help me out.
Are there any q learning courses you'd recommend?

So I started a new job recently which is primarily in Python, so there's that. My side project, which is what I came to post about, is a dominoes game in PyQt. I have all of the graphical elements ready to go; branches form correctly and dominoes pick up, drop off, and draw in the proper locations. I'm starting to do a couple of scoring routines, some to check the outcome of plays. At this point, I can add house rule options like 'nickel for knocking'. Kind of stuck on the AI portion of the project at this point.

Can you elaborate on your problem a bit more? What type of data is getting stored into MySQL? What should make it filtered? What should allow it to go through? AI for this sort of task seems overkill. There is a large margin of error for what a model will say is correct and what is actually correct if it is hard to explain the problem scope.

This was asked here not long ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aqqzjl/is_there_any_support_in_python_for_something/
Whenever I want to hook up a web front end (React/Angular) to my Python back end, I create a web service. My preference is Flask, but you can use any framework you want. Then you just make HTTP requests and responses to pass the logic between the two.
Major ongoing progress on a project that was in hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library. * GitHub: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang * Official blog (still minimal): http://aki.genjipress.com * Quick demo movie (outdated but fun -- this was from the original incarnation of the project) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8 The project is now officially an alpha! It was "don't use" until now, because too much was missing, but it is now possible to pull from master and run a Conway's Game Of Life demo bundled with it. Post-PyCon, I rewrote the entire front end to use the Lark parser, replacing David Beazley's Sly.
Ah okay - thanks so much! So create a Python web server using something like flask, and then make GET/POST requests to and from the Python back end from the react front end?
I'm on the Sourcetrail team, currently working on the Python extension (not yet released). So basically this will be a tool that reads any Python code and displays an interactive dependency graph where you can click on a function definition and see all the contexts where the function may be used (ofc. you can also click variables or types). For language analysis I am using [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi). Here's the repo: [https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailPythonIndexer](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailPythonIndexer)
Yes you will make HTTP calls from the react frontend, most likely using a library like a axios. You will hit your flask endpoints that will have a connection to your DB.. and they will provide the data needed to populate your frontend
Thanks a lot &lt;3
Any particular recommendations?
1. A little bit at a time! Pycon talks are a nice way to get a taste for something you haven't used before, or take a deep dive into the inner workings of something you have. If you enjoy learning about this stuff I don't think it's particularly difficult to keep up. 2. I'm not sure what you mean by "put this knowledge into practice", exactly, but my company makes use of many advanced python features. Not async at the moment, unfortunately, but we generally emphasize using the best tool for the job.
Python, unlike JavaScript, lets you do imports of dynamically-computed names, update the search path at run time, and manipulate the import system in various other ways. When it's possible to import different modules depending on the behavior of arbitrary code, [Rice's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem) rears its head. In practice, it's possible to accidentally write an import that the static analyzer can't see for some reason, so you'd have to manually maintain a list of "modules to package even though it looks like they're not used". It's not really worth the effort for most use cases.
Is there a channel out there keeping up with the updates of the different Py**events**? Because it becomes kinda difficult to follow everything tbh
Sentdex
Yup. Fixed. Thanks.
We use a decent amount of big python stuff at my work because our main product is a Django application with a 9 year old codebase. Not using much of stuff like Async because we're still in the process of porting over that codebase to Python 3. I get the impression from a lot of the recruiter emails I get that the local python community has a number of companies similarly working on actual applications in Python &amp; not just as some sort of chaotic support to what they actually do.
&gt; A little bit at a time! Pycon talks are a nice way to get a taste for something you haven't used before, or take a deep dive into the inner workings of something you have. If you enjoy learning about this stuff I don't think it's particularly difficult to keep up. Are you serious? I work 8 hours a day, then go home and try to keep up with python developments. I have no family, nothing else to do but follow python, the peps, and the mailing lists, and now they just posted the equivalent of weeks of talks. It will take me months to actually follow them and when I am done, there will be probably more. &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "put this knowledge into practice", exactly, but my company makes use of many advanced python features. Not async at the moment, unfortunately, but we generally emphasize using the best tool for the job. What is your company and are they hiring? because I've been in at least ten companies, and none of them used anything above python 2.7.
Well, I can recommend the Scipy conference in Austin in July. It's huge, and will likely be a good place to find companies that are recruiting.
Currently have an assignment for my Masters, about running some ML algorithms in Python on 2017 French presidential election tweets (about 50k in an XML file), and I finally managed to lemmatise all French words (there’s no French language lemmatiser in Python yet) ! So I can finally move on from data prep to ML \m/
Good bot
Misleading name, makes it sound like a Python re-implementation of Ruby on Rails.
For question 2: there was a Pycon presentation 2(?) years ago about incrementally moving from Python 2 to 3 that our company is adopting. Very thoughtful and actionable
Yes, you should be able to find them via meetups
The current [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) shows that Python improved it's ranking by 2.64% since 12 months ago, more than twice as much as any other language. Python was also TIOBE's "Language Hall of Fame" winner for 2018 for having the highest rise in ratings last year. I don't completely trust the accuracy of TIOBE, because their method seems questionable, and the data seems to have a lot of noise in it, but if you're looking for data points to support your foregone conclusion, it's a start.
&gt; Are there a lot of python (web) jobs in your area? Nope! I have heard that they're common in the major tech hubs but elsewhere, web development jobs all seem to be Java or C#. I've met many people who use Python for occasional help in their non-developer jobs (scientific researchers etc), but very few full-time Python developers.
Do you mean closed source implementation? Because python in Red Hat Linux is a commercial version, but with open source license.

How can I do it without checking the surrounding of each cell one by one?
Content is good, but I upvoted mainly because these reviews are nicely organized. I got to read what I wanted to read, and I skimmed what I only cared to skim. Top notch.
How did you install it? Normally when you download a `tar.xz` you build from source, something like this: ./configure make sudo make install so whatever directory the source is unpacked in and you ran `sudo make install` you should be able to run `sudo make uninstall` too.
&gt;If you want a complex web application that handles booking and real time GPS tracking of your exterminators across multiple cities with API connectivity to Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, then you're probably going to want to hire a programmer after the application is deployed then what is the job of the programmer? Basically he makes ''not so much working''... what does he make since 8:00 to 17:00 of evryday?
I’m sorry for cross posting, but I do hope to find help over here
I got my mistake. I didn't see that it is giving error **The directory '/home/name/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.** **The directory '/home/name/.cache/pip' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and caching wheels has been disabled. check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.** &amp;#x200B; so i have to install it as super user. Is there any better way to do this? Installing it with super user is not good i think and -H flag didn't work.

Basically he makes ''not so much working''... what does he make since 8:00 to 17:00 of evryday?
something like https://www.python.org/events ?
I don’t necessarily know if you meant to reply to me, but after the application is deployed their job is: 1. Improvements or changes to the application. 2. Quality defect or security fixes to the application. 3. New applications. My question to you is, have you ever worked in a professional setting deploying or supporting custom programmed applications?
Bug fixes, new features, maintenance. He's absolutely working. If the software is done and deployed and needs no more maintenance (which rarely happens) then they get laid off. It's like any other employee that is no longer relevant. It would be helpful if you want a better reply to say what kind of company and what kind of project you're thinking of.
If you had the same thing but as a YT channel, I'd be really grateful =)
It's a Python implementation of the same idea: generated boilerplate for a common use-case, favoring convention over configuration.
Oh! i am bad at this. I deleted that directory where i unpacked Python3.7.3 after installing. Do I need that directory to uninstall?
What you will get developed in python in $1000, you could get it developed in $500 or less in PHP. Also python is not as fast as c# or PHP, so very few companies do web development in Python
You could install it again, and run the uninstall script once more. Or you could manually delete the files - have to figure out what files were installed where though.
Almost every word of this is false.
i don't, sorry.
I think it's common to install python as root. Shouldn't be a problem. Or you could try to change the owner of the above folders with the [`chown` command](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchown.htm).

Java, C#, Rails, and Node still rock my area for webdev and I live in a tech hub. Django and Flask are definitely a minority here.
Actually python is not that mainstream outside of data science and some web programming. Data science is hyping but not that huge. Java c.. Still have alot more jobs.
I searched the key words for each language on the biggest job market for my city; 340 job for C#, 295 for Python and 292 for Java. Didn't expect it to be so close.
Lot's of Python jobs here in DC. (Speaking of which, if anyone in the area is looking for a full-stack opportunity, hit me up.)
im from Iran and can't move to the us and yet, half the job suggestions in the linkedin/so/glassdor are jobs in the us!
Yup. All of FAANG uses Python, at least in some capacity. Tons of smaller startups use python as well. I'm in NYC.
You'd rather watch a video than glance through a bulleted list of items?
Curious. Why didn't you go for the deeplearning.ai course by Andrew Ng on Coursera?
It's like concentrated stupid.
**Maintaining code:** bug fixes, performance enhancements, adding new features, adding tests and doing tests, updating dependent libraries, fixing security vulnerabilities, changing code to ensure that it adheres to new government policies (GDPR for example, you fail to do this and by the time your new freelancer fixes it you are in a law suite), ensure that application handles increased number of clients (Imagine you build the software to handle 1000 users, you start with 100 and it eventually becomes 2000, boom your application no longer works because of load, by the time your new freelancer figure out the code your clients switches to a competitor and you are struggling to pay your debt and you are gained nothing). Since you are very skeptical about what most people are telling you here. Go ahead and hire freelancers to do all above. Enjoy!
The Philadelphia area is booming with python full-stack dev jobs (and yes, a lot of java web jobs too.) Even, or especially, center city Philadelphia.
I live in Austin and I develop mostly fully time with Python. At some point, you need to let go of the tool or language and figure out what you want to do, though. Java isn't boring, but maybe you're tired of writing in Java or you're tired of the plumbing that you're currently doing with Java. Find something you enjoy and then find a way to make it your job.
Nashville is fairly heavy Python city. But Java/.net still take the cake. I get 3 or 4 recruiter a week hitting me up for Python jobs.
Yeah, I guess I meant to stay my current work with Java is boring. How is Austin? Do you work for a startup? I’m down in SA and have been thinking about making the move up
Not that mainstream? That's just not true at all.
My employer is looking for fully remote python/django backend engineers. [https://doctorondemand.com/about-us/careers/google-hire](https://doctorondemand.com/about-us/careers/google-hire) We already have one engineer in TX.

Your lambdas are actually being created individually, but are taking a closure of the key variable, which will be changed as the loop is executed. So all of those lambdas end up referring to the same variable, and won’t attempt to resolve the value of it until they are called. What you could do instead is use a partial to gather the value rather than the reference to key.
I think SA is wonderful for: * raising a family * cheap cost of living Austin is not nearly as affordable, but the startup scene is _FAR_ better. Use indeed.com and hired.com to get a sense of what's up here. My brother and his family and my parents live in SA, though we are all non-Texans. In some circles, they're calling Austin: Silicon Hills. The big giants in CA all have an expanding presence here (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook). And Austin looks decent from a California perspective because of the difference in cost of living. But that has gone up considerably even in the past 5 years; it's still just a little over the national average, though.
Appreciate you detailed reply :)
Yeah I’ve heard the startup scene is great, that’s what I’m really interested in. I’m only 20 so don’t have to worry about raising a family lol, so it might be time to move up there. Thanks for the info !
It works as expected now, thank you.
I'm halfway through the talk by Beazley, and it's pretty mind blowing, but pretty amazing. As is lambda calculus in general :D
Code is recognized by how it looks on the page. It's a matter of image recognition. You can't just softwrap code, otherwise it'll look different from every computer you look at it from, which makes it harder to understand and recognize. This is the whole reason programmers are so opiniated about styles. Text soft wrapping only really works under certain conditions, such as in the case of writing English, where +/- a few characters doesn't matter too much, but only to a point. Epub readers even go as far as spliting text into 2 pages side by side to assist reading, otherwise the text doesn't read as it should be read. It's extremely hard to read long lines, because previous text shifts outside of your field of vision too quickly, making it hard to skim back and forth. Essentially the top and bottom lines act as a memory buffer. You forget something you skim up, you get bored of what is being said or understand what is being said, you skim down, without losing your position. Essentially eyes are like 2 dimentional cursors, so it's very important to optimize organization of information, more so then it is to make better use of screen space.
Check the HN "Who's Hiring?" thread. Someone made a search engine for it too. There's a similar thread on some subreddit.
Genial! Muchisimas gracias. Me encanta el enfoque que se le da a la carrera por lo que estuve viendo, pero no se hasta donde es del todo compatible con la econometría que en principio es lo que mas me motiva.
Just went to PyCon and hoping SciPy will be just as good!
The reason for that rule is that your field of vision depends on things being close together in context to be close together in geometry, in order to be able to skim properly. Your eyes are essentially like 2 dimentional cursors. Comparing things is easier if they're close in your field of vision. It's also important for things that aren't related in context to be further apart in order to ensure your brain doesn't relate them to each other. The problem is when you think about screen space, you're not thinking about how you're reading the text. Pages are more narrow than they're wide, and chunks down into blocks when it gets too wide, in order to make skimming of said text easier.

You don't have to watch every talk, probably around 30% are useful to a given random developer. I watch them at work during lunch (absolute max 1 hour a day)
The talk on Python Certification is actually fairly interesting if you are involved with Education or CTE at all. Its pretty short as well. [The talk](https://youtu.be/jZoa8IUoqEw)
aaaah that's better thanks a lot!
That's some interesting analysis. Do you think you can get better than google for your needs
I went down that rabbit hole before.
Been working to get a reasonably good-looking interpolation of Rosettas images into realtime video. I've actually finished most of the work already, but haven't found the time to compile it into a good looking video and upload it yet.

Raymond Hettingers modern solvers talk was really interesting
They do have a few really good authors, but if you don't know who they are, then I would skip it
If you have any issues with the book, let me know. I will be happy to help
You can get some free sample chapters here - [https://leanpub.com/creatingapplicationswithwxpython/](https://leanpub.com/creatingapplicationswithwxpython/)
I would go with Kivy or PyQt for something like this. You could probably do it with wxPython (which is what I prefer), but I think that would take more work than the other two.
Sadly, the two best keynotes - Sha and Jessica McKellar - were lost. It sounds like they will try to re-record them, though.
I just started a side project to use my sound card as an oscilloscope.
I am working on implementing a script which will read an excel, convert all financial values in the excel to our native currency via the European central bank and then paste them back into the same excel. It's a small task and won't take me long but it usually is done by someone from finance who goes row by row and does it manually...
We can't tell you where the indentation mistake is without a trace back (error message)

I also work 8 hours a day in python... And I'm doing a part time Masters degree on the side. I feel like I'm keeping up OK. Like /u/AlexyBelov says, just pick the talks that look interesting to you. I don't intend to watch all of them. &amp;#x200B; &gt;What is your company and are they hiring? &amp;#x200B; [We are](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/159863/advanced-python-engineer-research-affiliates)!
Do you have a source for this? I've been wondering why that keynote wasn't posted.
It’s used a lot in research settings.
After the `while:`, it expects an identation block. What you want to put there is a function call rather than a definition. Most likely a function call to one that contains the code under `if __name__...`.
Well it's on line 12
You guys are also on meetup.com? I have no collegues on Facebook.
Your function defs need to be indented since you want them within your while loop.

If someone is interested I have an account on udemy with machine learning for python bought. There was a big discount so ye. I can share if someone is interested. (Plz dont steal)
I really wish ppl would stop prefacing their python libraries with py. Tabby would have completely fine and I'm completely aware were using Python already
Not sure about better results, but for a trip with multiple destinations and flexible dates it at least less painful and less boring, as I don't need to do hundreds of clicks on google flights.
I think an acceptable use would be if one ported an existing library from another language. Tack "py" onto the original's name.
Don't forget to look into websockets.
I probably agree.
Not every piece of content ever created needs to be consumed. The talks are a buffet. Watch what you want to.
Solid and intestine write up. Thanks for sharing!
Many thanks 😊

You might like [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html) for that.
I have a directory containing files of the results of games. The names of the files are a long string of different identifiers associated with the game - my name, opp's name, where played, date, time, and and identifier. The file name is pretty hard to read so I decided to write an app that would change the file name to a simpler format: opp's name and date. Yes, it is a simple program, but I am almost a beginner(participate in Codeforces and Hackerrank) and didn't know this type of thing could be done.

I’m very early on in learning Python so I apologize in advance if this isn’t close to what you’re looking for. The flow based editor reminds me of Microsoft azure ML studio where you can easily enter your data sets, use their pre made sets for cleaning, splitting, and training the data or run feature selection and you can also implement your own python code in it as well.

I only clicked on this post because of the kitty thumbnail
Thank you, Pycon 2019 was my first pycon and I had a blast. I learned alot! I enjoyed sprinting with maintainers.
I love such small tools which makes the Workday much easier.
Did you try the Skyscanner API at all?
I need a snapshot tool. Download some pictures from specific urls and place them in folders every 2 minutes. Configuration can be done in an Json file wich is readed on every call. With nice log file and distributed as some exe file for give it away without beeing worried about py library support on target machine.
Think about some easy task and solve it. Maybe read something from an URL and write it in a file. Could recommend requests for this. Or make some script which replaces dots in filenames with spaces without messing up the extension. Such small task where my start with the most languages I know.
The job specs are far from being specific at all. It's a junior position to do research and development in computer vision, image processing, signal processing and machine learning.

The idea is sound but software development and computing in general has a lot of feelgood rules that sound good but a lot of things sound good but aren't true. That is just the way things are but are these practices backed by relavent data? Or they were relavent 20 years ago (if they weren't misunderstood to begin with; see typing sync multiple times in Linux)
Thanks for the shoutout! (gave the adv asyncio talk)
Thanks for the awesome talk! I did not get to see your talk in person, but I watched it after the fact and it was a pretty great one. I have not really gotten into actually testing `asyncio`, but I definitely learned a bunch!
You could create an in memory csv file, append each row of data to the file and then read the csv file into a dataframe at the end of the process. You could add write the url as field to each row you write so you end up with a single df in the end. &amp;#x200B; import pandas as pd from io import StringIO import csv # set up csv output = StringIO() writer = csv.writer(output) writer.writerow(['URL', 'Product', 'Year', 'Size','Storage','Price']) # urls url = r"https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2016-13-touch" url2 = r"https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2017-13-touch" url3 = r"https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/macbook-pro-2018-15-touch" url4 = r"https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2015-retina-13" urls = [url, url2, url2, url3, url4] for u in urls: # do something to get value for product, year, size, storage and price # then write a row writer.writerow([u, product, year, size, storage, price]) output.seek(0) df = pd.read_csv(output)
Thanks, I appreciate the forward!
Python wrapper for xdotool https://github.com/rshk/python-libxdo Super easy to use. Write your tests, wrapping it up in a docker build, pull in your application to test, and done. Although, as others have said this is the wrong way to go about testing something, but that isn’t what you asked.
I found it in a backup hard drive. It looks like the user downloaded and unzipped some installation files, but I'm not too sure. The path is Downloads/spyder-2.3.9/spyderlib/spyder.py If the file exists on your machine, you should be able to find it by searching spyder.py in your root directory.

Thank you for the link. I read through it. I can read all the words using that guide and the libraries. But it doesn't seem to be able to read for example, "Employees" &lt;- Let's say its inside cell A1, and I need to grab all the names under employees. It doesn't seem to have an option to say hey grab everything under Employee's and store them under eNames variable so I can call for example, eNames\[1\] or how ever I need to write the code so that it reads the employee located at A2. Does that make sense?
This is great, thanks. I will look into that. I saw something in my Python book about Django but I'm not sure if that is the easiest or best route to take for what I am trying to do.
when I am not looking.... perfect.
It’s either Django or Flask, both are frameworks for developing web app. If you have resources about Django, that would probably work as well. For me, it was surprising hard to learn the framework so I had to take an online course in the end. But it was so satisfying when I managed to get it to work:
Those keynotes were really superb and I’m so sad the recordings didn’t make it.
I just found this: &amp;#x200B; [https://blog.chezo.uno/tabula-py-extract-table-from-pdf-into-python-dataframe-6c7acfa5f302](https://blog.chezo.uno/tabula-py-extract-table-from-pdf-into-python-dataframe-6c7acfa5f302) &amp;#x200B; I am going to try this and see how it works. Thank you again
Going to watch a Flask tutorial later and see if I can follow that better.
It really depends on just how well constructed the PDF is. &amp;#x200B; If they built it the right way it will merely be painful. &amp;#x200B; If they did something...brilliant, like rendering the type as images and then embedding them in the PDF you're...ahem. &amp;#x200B; Can you select the type in the PDF?
Python is super useful in the games industry. Tools for graphics software are often based around a Python framework.
That's why you have a brain. Your brain is a statistical tool you can use when scientific rules just aren't sufficiently flexible or efficient to actually solve a problem. Like I was saying to someone else, the eyes are exactly like 2 dimentional cursors, and it depends on somethings being clumbed closer together then others in order to establish meaning. Skimming through text is harder if you don't have a paragraph, because it's easier to remember a smaller 2 dimentional coordinate then it is to remember a longer (20 to 50 times longer) single scalar coordinate. There's nothing about this that needs proving. It's fair common sense. You put a new line after every entry in a dictionary, and you don't need proof to understand that now putting a new line after every entry would make it unreadable. Your brain is extremely good at geometry, so much so that entire mnemonic systems have been developed around it. Proving such methods thought is near impossible, and such is life when it comes to anything having to do with psychology, you need to depend on how you feel, not so much on numbers, because numbers are typically widely inaccurate, even when they're done properly, the error margin is absolutely massive.
I’ll have to find out when she goes back to work in a couple of days I’m not sure exactly how they exported/saved. My wife thinks they printed to PDF from the scheduling program.
I'm continuing work on [https://github.com/djotaku/ELDonationTracker](https://github.com/djotaku/ELDonationTracker), specifically in the devel branch as I finish up an OOP refactoring I did in order to prepare for writing a proper GUI. The program itself generates text files for use in XSplit or OBS to track donations for the Extra Life charity event during a livestream. (Or for recording for later) The videos referenced in the README.MD explain how it works/how to use it.

If you're looking at Flask, I'd take a look at [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/structure.html). The docs are pretty thorough.
Like a table? Accessing [i,j]
Checkout both of these repos (they both are structured differently and the first is much simpler): * https://github.com/realpython/flask-boilerplate * https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask They may be a little bit overwhelming now but if you take the development of your own in steps while referencing either of these learning the ropes and building something solid will be much easier. Also, when working with Flask it's very hard to avoid circular imports if you want to make your app modular like the second repo I linked instead of all in one file like the first. It can be frustrating but there are design structures that avoid it which the second repo does very well. Another relevant link to credit the people who helped me when I was in your shoes: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42909816/can-i-avoid-circular-imports-in-flask-and-sqlalchemy
I mostly use Flask, but I'm more than familiar with Django. Should I apply?
Not everybody loves QA but its a great field to get a job in for Python. Im 18 and working as a QA Engineer at a startup in Boston
I know. I left the grand ballroom 1000% excited to share. Glad I got to be there.
Yes
What we're they about?
Lynn your talk was excellent!! Ive not really used asyncio before but I came out with some useful information to bring back to my team. I like how you gradually built up the complexity of the code through the talk to me e the examples digestable. Also if you dont mind me asking, any advice for someone looking to submit a proposal? I love public speaking and explaining and want to submit something for next year's PyCon especially since it's where I live. I had a blast giving a lightning talk this year and would love to have a chance at a full talk if I have a good idea for one.
Ah, I'm guessing that's why the sat AM lightning talks weren't posted either? Good thing I snagged mine on my phone...
Same here! It was an incredible experience and I'm still riding the high. Feeling extra motivated at work and at home with my side projects.
Does anybody know any remote jobs? I'm from Brazil and I'm really not interested in working here (also not much Python opportunities here).
Great links. Looks like flask seems to be the way to go.
Beazley writing code is an art, I love watching all his talks
third this
Are these opportunities restricted to US developers?
Am i reading their materials right, that only enthought and bloomberg will be allowed to recruit for like six positions total, since they’re sponsors?
I have experience with Flask, Vue, Javascript (and some mild experience with Redis/Postgres/MySQL/Android/Django). I'd love to work for you guys but I'm currently attending college with my GI Bill (I was active duty military for 7 years). Is there any room for some part-time work? (I'd be willing to forfeit most of the benefits). PS: You guys should check out [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) if you get a chance, it may make things easier/cheaper depending on your use case.
Hmm, then if money allows it purchase the PyImage course, if you don't have time to get into heavy detail prior to the interview, get Rajeev's two udemy courses.
Actually, I used that course a bit. It's quite good too! but no where near the amount of info in the courses above. It's still very very well explained by Andrew though. I just used it for snippets though so I didn't add it to my review. But overall I'd give it a 4.3/5

There are what's known as GUI Framworks. There are several frameworks that are used to create GUI applications such as QT, Kivy, PyGame, etc. Each framework is unique and can be complicated to learn at first. You definitely should have a solid understanding of the core language of Python before these frameworks will make sense.
Decorators are great. New thing I’ve been doing is defining argparsers for command line tools in decorators and decoratjng any functions that use the command line. It’s so clean and easy to read
It's not directly Python related, but for anyone who hasn't learned much about Lambda Calculus and love a good mind fuck, I highly recommend the [tutorial by David Beazley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkCLMl0e_0k). He derives it all from scratch in Python all the way up to (spoiler) &gt;!the Y-Combinator!&lt;. I don't think there's any real use, but it's really a fun subject and will mess with your head big time. I really love the approach he takes and being able to run the code yourself and play around is very helpful.
To raise any number to a power use ** instead of ^ in python
Loved that talk, and it finishes strong too. That final construct (won't spoil it but anyone familiar with HackerNews should know the name) is a thing of absolute beauty, especially when you see it derived all the way from scratch.
Please read the rules, this is best on /r/learnpython. ^ is bitwise xor, ** is power
You likely need an intermediary file (schedule.csv), which has all info stored as a csv file and then, you can programmatically export (via Python) based on an array pulled from this intermediary file.

Raymond Hettingers never disappoints, definitely my top Pycon speaker, and in this case it sounds like he had a full crowd too. My second favorite speaker is [Brandon Rhodes](https://pyvideo.org/speaker/brandon-rhodes.html) but it seems like he wasn't at this pycon.
You didn’t put this in your details so I’ll make this comment: Please consider how publicly visible your final product will be, and what personally identifiable information will be available.
Looks cool looking forward to trying it out
In brief: Sha was a felon at 18, and through hard work became a python programmer. Takeaway: offering opportunities to felons is good. Jessica has been working on prison outreach, trying to bring opportunities to felons. The prison system is racist and bad.
Unittest. It’s unfathomable the amount of shitty bugs caught just while writing the unit test, let alone what you find after code changes. Sometimes I question my competency based on the bone headed things I find from testing. Contextlib. Context managers are the greatest things ever. Collections.deque. Greatly outperforms lists, especially when you have a mini queue that doesn’t really require the overhead of using the actual Queue. And it’s not really a module, but list comprehension. You could make the argument that stuffing things into one line is hard to read, but it makes sense in my head and I like the way it looks so I use it all the time.
You don’t need to do TDD, but you have tests. Just update them to work with your new system. For the future, it’s better to update a bit at a time, both tests and code.
Just a guess, you are setting str which is a core python class or whatever they call it. See what happens if you change it to test_str =

I read the spreadsheet into a dictionary with the customer name as the key and a the start and end number that related to the file number. I then looped over the dictionary and created a PDF with the file named the customer name and appended all the PDFs from the start number to end number to the new PDF. He was going to do it manually using acrobat, it took 15 minutes to write and would have taken him days to do manually.

Ah yes, decorators. The pointers of Python (in terms of new students not getting it).
Check if that web have some kind of API, the you can use it with a python and flask
Darn, pretty sure you are right. I will try in a sec!
You were right! Thank you so much. It never crossed my mind and Python interpreter was kind to me on such a noob mistake.

I think this is a good start but I do have some critiques on the structure of your presentation. So my question is who is this for? You say "for those who have heard of deep learning, but find it challenging to implement different algorithms" To me that implies people that have a very superficial understanding of machine/deep learning. People that might have watched a couple youtube videos on the things that a neural network can do but never sat down and read the research papers that the work was built off of. I think you need to be very specific in who your target audience is. Your code does not make it easy to understand who your audience is either. You use these toy examples that are more or less the hello world of ml/dl but your comments and lack of explanation assume your reader already knows the fundamental concepts. For more advance users that can understand the work flow, your examples are too basic. For people wanting to learn about ml/dl your examples are good but you don't explain things well enough. With the examples you provide I think it's more geared toward the latter. For people getting into ml/dl they need deep explanations of why you're doing the things your doing, instead of just showing them code with a couple of comments above it. Explain the architecture, why would someone choose a random forest or svm or an mlp vs a deep neural network? Whats the difference between a regression and a classification? Why do you choose the hyper parameters that you do and what difference do they make? How do you tune them to give better predictions? What are different methods for splitting your data up into training, validation, and test sets. How do you evaluate performance when accuracy isn't a good metric? Everything needs to be explainable. I think these are basic questions that need to be answered and I can think of probably a dozen more. It feels like you're trying to do 2 things at the same time but can't make up your mind. This is a terrible analogy but I can't think of anything different. It's like you're trying to teach an artist and a monkey how to paint a picture. The artist will get bored and find something else to do, while the monkey may get good at drawing the picture you teach it, but will never be able to do anything else beacause ti doesn't know what art is. I'm not trying to be mean or cynical, I think you did a good job, you just need to take it a step further.
Glad it was an easy fix. In python you can do anything to anything as long as the syntax is correct, so it's easy to do. I'm surprised the pylint message wasn't more clear. I'm pretty sure I have done the same thing with some other core python class and pylint let me know I was redefining something I shouldn't be.
So decorators just a way of using higher order functions?
I go through and add my top 30 or so to my watch later queue on YouTube and treat it like the latest season of my favorite show, which is about equivalent in length. I try to mix it up between the short talks and trying to binge watch a lengthy tutorial. I inevitably don't make it to like a dozen of them before the next conference, but no big deal, they're always there in the backlog of I want to feed my brain one day. For many of the less technical or visually engaging talks I listen while playing something semi-mindless on my Switch, which is already something I do with podcasts. Also, the tutorials are less of a commitment than they appear because you can fast forward through the exercises and the video often includes the 30 minute break that can be skipped. A 3 hour tutorial is really like 2 hours of actual content or something.
As far as I know doesn't exist. You can use node-red and use python instead of js in the workflow, say for parsing or manipulation of data. I can't remember the specifics but I know it's doable albeit a little hacky. Someone needs to write a node-red analog for python using sqlalchemy orms and pandas as the heavy lifters, would be amazing.
Huh, I added a bunch to my YouTube queue several days ago and I'm pretty sure the keynote is the only one I had in common with you! Gotta love how people are so different! Such an amazing keynote though!!! I told everyone at work about the Black Swan!
The talk about Black was really useful for me.
I've done ok just thinking of them as wrappers to extend a function. Is that not what's going on? Otherwise there seems to be an excess of heartache over the subject.
Thanks for doing this— I’ve got 3 “UI/application” related questions since it seems like you’ve gone deep in this for the latest book. (1) Regarding application updating frameworks/patterns, I was wondering if you touched upon this topic in the book? You know, the whole application call backs to “home” and gets an update (you can maybe “force it” on the user or make them choose). I’d love to know your thoughts. I’ve been getting some amazing mileage from Pyupdater which more or less sits on top of pyinstaller. Curious your insight to this subject. (2) I know the book is wxPython but I’d love to get your thoughts on a pure OpenGL interface for an application — I’ve been eyeing ModernGL to simplify things but I thought maybe you’d have some wisdom here...Disclaimer, I know the python community here is gonna jump down my throat for a GUI built in OpenGL but it does have some benefits if you break away from traditional approaches/mold— please don’t down vote me to oblivion. (3) Do touch into cloud/remote operations (for the propriety IP code that can’t be bundled with an app) and the GUI is really a “shell” to interface with those external calls? I know there’s no real way to truly encrypt/secure a python compiled app (so I won’t even ask). Just curious if you touch on those patterns.
Do you have an example? I write lots of CLI tools and would love to improve legibility.
If you're doing this to learn, I'd say go for it. Http for human is a cool python package that has some internet logic stuff, you could prob wrap something around that that accomplishes what your looking for, and could learn some stuff too. If this is because you need a site monitor, there are a lot of existing free services and products you could use as standalone services or site add-ons that can get this done. No need to reinvent the wheel if you're making cars, but learning to make tires isn't a waste of time either if you have the time to spare.
I don't see it listed under your company's Linkedin job section. You may consider having your HR department post an ad there for more exposure.
It's a new software and so it's not tested enough to be included in Debian/Ubuntu/Mint official repos. Use pip: pip install PySimpleGUI, and upgrade it every now and then with pip install -U PySimpleGUI.
Ogh, agree. But OP was asking about Python jobs. Regrettably, this already shows OP may not be up to for the task - if cannot find on own the roles, where his skills match the demand.
you mentioned a site monitor, and thats what I wanted to try ro learn to build haha. I have to do some more research but do you know if http for humans has a user/password logic?
Probably the best tip about hiring I've ever heard: make them say no.
so maybe the poster is looking for python jobs in the wrong place:)
So if there isn't an API for the site http for human's isn't going to help you login, but you don't need to login to see if a site is up. Http return codes on a get could tell you enough depending on how feature rich you want the monitor to be. If you want to verfiy the site's auth is working/its db connection is correct or things like that you would certainly need more. In that case it might make more sense to add an endpoint to the site that the monitor could talk to (assuming its your site you want to monitor and there isn't already an existing API on it).
Your talk was great, thanks!
&gt; Jessica has been working on prison outreach, trying to bring opportunities to felons. The prison system is racist and bad. How's that related to python??
Nice list!
Nice article!
I'm currently building https://github.com/ethanhs/abserde a tool to generate fast, strongly typed JSON parsers from Python type stubs. It's still mostly an experiment, but it should basically be usable.
There are no Pro-only features that a noob would find useful. However if you can afford it you should anyway because it's quality software and you should want to support the people who write it.

The obly talk I watched so far and it was brilliant, I later found the graceful shutdown problems on your blog too and used it as heavy inspiration - thanks a lot!
Good list, I wish they would have spent more time making Pathlib compatible with all the stdlib. I don't remember which modules, but it doesn't play nice with everything in `os`, `shutil`, `subprocess`, etc. Was super frustrating to integrate pathlib and have to undo everything when it didn't jive with the rest of the codebase.
That's good to hear.
pathlib, enum, hinting I learned early on. Very useful when processing JSON and CSV files and making your code more readable. Extended iterable unpacking is just sex on a stick. I definitely need to use implicit namespace packages more. I have so much need for LRU cache. Good list!
Great work! A good reminder of new things I've read about but never thought about when developing.
Another good one that I love is "yield from".
I don't think I had issue with pathlib and other packages in the base, unless you mean that there were some places where I had to wrap the path inside a `str()` to get a string containing the path.
I love fstrings the for functional testing, sadly c++ build/package scripts have to be built on python 3.5 because that's what comes with ununtu 16.04lts. so no fstrings, and weakened pathlib support
Didn't know about hint typing. This should definitely assist with maintaining code with a bunch of external library dependencies.
What's this have to do with Beyonce?
You can always use `str(path)`.
It is much better with python 3.7, even with 3.6 I don't think I have to str(path) for anything other then subprocess arguments and passing to third party libraries like matplotpib
&gt; most Python 3 I find still looks like Python 2, but with parentheses Ha, so true
Because that's what the gods of python decided to do. It makes sense when you think of lists and tuples in a semantic way. Tuples are used for groups of dissimilar things that are related. In general a given tuple has a specific length. Eg `car_features = ('subaru', 'outback', 'red', 'gasoline')`. Each item position correlates to a specific attribute, and often a type. Unlike lists, which are used for groups of similar things, often with the length being variable from one run to the next. eg `places=['atlanta', 'boston', 'los angeles']`. Lists are generally of a single type, and all the elements can be treated in the same way.
Thanks for the heads-up
Thanks! That's really unfortunate. ☹️
Looks like the last one is quite misleading (or I'm just not understanding it) at first I thought that \_\_init\_\_.py is no longer needed. Apparently this is just a behavior that helps with creating namespace packages, something that probably mostly is useful for people writing libraries that are so large that then are split into multiple packages that are individually installable. So probably not useful for most of us.
Well, there isn't really a good why answer to your question without going deep into language design. They are different, behave differently, and therefore it's useful to have different types for them. Most notably tuples are immutable and lists are mutable. Lists are created with square brackets, whereas tuples are made with parentheses. Variable length `*args` are immutable sequences, and therefore they are tuples.
Have a look at [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) or [pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) in that case.
My take away was that her keynote wasn't so much about the python language as the python community. We have a great deal of technological expertise, and we can use it to accomplish important things for the betterment of society. It was very inspiring.
I'm probably and old fart but I never managed to like pathlib. I can't explain it.
pathlib's integration with stdlib is vastly improved in 3.6 (and 3.6 is a major improvement overall). It's too much trouble to use in 3.5.
Thanks for pointing this out. Baby steps first. The developers at my company wouldn't even know what to do with this. But this is also coming from a group of people who have never written a class before and do everything in a mediocre half assed way.
Need 3.6! I keep being surprised just how many small goodies may it into that release. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0519/ But then I still *do* feel weird that neither of pathlib and ospath have a clear superset of functionality, sometimes it's not even close! Then there's that huge, only partially-rational desire to use just one or the other for everything -- and then running into exactly what you need only in the other lib.
Yep, and when you use it with IDE that actually understand them (like PyCharm) it is pleasure to code, now it highlights possible errors, you have a real autocomplete and refactoring works correctly. It's especially nice when authors of libraries that you use also added types for example aiohttp. My current job requires me to code in Go, but I swear that these above features work much better with typed Python on PyCharm than with Go in GoLand.
Very nice, thanks. Actually learned a few new things from this list
Is this mostly predicated on the linter? I wonder if this would work with VSCode and flake8?
I think the answer is to some degree reflected by that function `*args` are always exhaustive, whereas with regular unpacking you could have done `first, second, *others, last`. If `*others` were a tuple, the interpreter couldn't just pop one off the end to assign to `last`, but would rather have to do a slower lookahead test. Or maybe the interpreter unpacks them in a different direction. Either way, function `*args` are probably just weird exceptions that don't follow regular unpacking rules.
The syntax used for annotating function/method arguments and return values was introduced in 3.0, not 3.5. And the syntax for annotating variables was introduced in 3.6. The thing that was introduced in Python 3.5 was the `typing` module in the standard library (and it was also made available as a standalone installable package for previous versions), which provides some helpers for annotating things like generics. That's also when the annotation feature officially was declared to be "use this for type hints and no other purpose", but previously that's like 99% of what people used it for. (also it's still not nearly as useful as it could or should be, due to design choices made earlier, and I'm not completely convinced that it can be rescued at this point)
What advantage does type hinting give over putting the types in the docstring?
Saved for further reading.
Continuing work on [treedoc](https://github.com/tommyod/treedoc), a CLI application which recursively inspects Python objects and outputs documentation. (treedoc) &gt; $ treedoc list --docstring 0 list(iterable) ├── list.append(self, object) ├── list.clear(self) ├── list.copy(self) ├── list.count(self, value) ├── list.extend(self, iterable) ├── list.index(self, value, start, stop) ├── list.insert(self, index, object) ├── list.pop(self, index) ├── list.remove(self, value) ├── list.reverse(self) └── list.sort(self, key, reverse) The code works on built-in classes such as `list` and `dict`, as well as on built-in packages such as `collections`. Over the next couple of days I hope to test on more built-in objects and well-known packages.
TIL!!!! Thanks!
When you use "Arbitrary arguments" in a function, they always get wrapped up into a tuple.
Great, thanks! Are you acquiring clients via a freelancing platform or do you just leverage your existing client base and use word of mouth?
&gt; full-stack Recruiters killed that expression for me - it means all they want, from frontend+backend to devops+driving a forklift. What does it mean for you?
PyCharm's type inference is good enough to treat them nearly equal. They even respect type comments, `self.number = 0.0 # type: Real`
Same, but we're limited by Yocto.
Scrappy will run on pi. You can (and should) is Python 3 too. No need to limit yourself to 2.7. Raspbian comes with both by default.
Thanks mate!
hmm maybe im getting my terms mixed up. I want to check to see if there are changes on a website instead of if it is up or not - for example get the html from a page every 30 seconds or something and see if a change happened, if you know what I'm saying haha
I'm not sure I understand you, if you mean running external program to do checks then you can use mypy (Guido is involved with it so it is what is shaping the tour annotations) as suggested in another response. You can use it as linter and it will list errors it finds, but won't help with auto complete or refactoring. PyCharm has its own built-in type checker that follows closely with mypy (I've seen people from Jet Brains commenting on various issues in mypy) and uses types for other functionality like mentioned autocomplete.
Wrong subreddit. Try asking at r/xml
I already use about half of these. Type hinting is standard in my code, and I'm working to converting any path-strings to pathlib.Path. str.format() still has it's uses, particularly when the formatting is more complex or the string is larger, but for small strings, f-strings are pretty helpful. I have my doubts about enums, but I could probably use a few dataclasses in my code...
I was confused. There is a flake8-mypy module that should lint these type checks. Thanks for the clarification.
Write a program that's supposed to run in linux and windows and has to deal with multiple paths, you'll come to appreciate the fact that the pathlib handles for you those stupid windows backward slashes.
I swear, if I see a fucking Fibonacci example again you'll read about me in the news.
Type hinting is more standardized than types in docstring, which usually means that editors can use them easily for auto-complete and such.
Going to read this tomorrow, thanks for sharing.
Not to go on off on a total tangent here, but the ubiquity of the Fibonacci example demonstrates to me the *extremely limited* scope of problems in software development where memoization or DP actually becomes useful. And yet, you get hit with this shit in technical interviews.
So it sounds like your server + API are already created (but in your control), and you are looking to automate the creation of a client? &amp;#x200B; The key part of this is documentation of your API in a format which other tools can understand. [Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/) is a popular choice for this, and there are [many](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/05db33c135d5e8c8220a4b3771d79c40cd94bcd5) [tools](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) which can do the kind of thing you're after once the API is codified.
Hey there, I appreciate ur help :) I've tried the root directory, sadly didn't found. Today, spider's maintainer told me that there will be out an beta version with full dark skin. I'm propably gonna try it and leave feedback :)
Why would I use format instead of %? The latter looks much cleaner and easy to me
I'm just practicing math functions for my 101 class, the transition from C++ to Python is rather smooth though I am still fumbling over coding what I want properly according to it's standards. I have a project due next week based on this so I'm looking to get this down and done before the weekend at least.
Please don't post screen shots of text. Text should be copied and pasted in your post, indented so it will be formatted as code. Text in images cannot be searched for, we cannot copy the code if we need to run it ourselves (we have to re-type it ourselves), and it is difficult or impossible for the blind or vision-impaired to read. They can use screen reader software to read text, but not text in images. Thank you.
It would be nice if you had a page dedicated to showing this months graphs and the months before.
I'm working on a cli currency converter that uses European Central Bank. I'm hoping to add rate alert system.
Every function and method you write should have at least one test, and probably many more. Otherwise how do you know the function is working? Even if you know it is working *today*, once it gets changed in the future, how do you know the changes haven't broken it? Every function should have a test to confirm that it returns the right value when given known good input. That should be considered the absolute bare minimum. To do better, you should test tricky corner cases ("it works with strings, but does it work with the empty string?"). You should test whether it raises the right exceptions when given bad input. If your functions modify globals or instance attributes, you should write "before and after" tests to confirm that they are modified correctly. In my experience, a mature, finished code base will have ten lines of test code for every line of application code. But don't let that scare you! Any tests are better than no tests. *One* test is better than no tests. Write as many or as few tests as you can, your code will be better for have *some tests* compared to having none at all.
This seems especially interesting, thank you
Thank you, I'm looking forward digging there

Just use c:/windows/Foo/bar.txt on Windows and everything works? I never have to use backslashes in Python.
Have you ever tried reading remotely a dataset in aws s3 ?
 def fib(n): a, b = 0, 1 for i in range(0, n): a, b = b, a + b return a
I really, really don't like dataclasses. Annotations were not meant to have logical meaning. Dataclasses take this concept and give executable value to your annotations. This is bad.
They're a lot easier to inspect in python using dunder methods. It opens up some cool API designs like data classes and dependency injection. Not sure what this would do in an existing codebase other than increase readability though.
It does work, your other comment re: flake8 + mypy. Typing lining works wonders in vscode, much less buggy than inspection.
Why? It's an elegant example of a recursive function that everyone knows about, and a good way to show how useful memoization is.
Hey thanks for getting back to me! Pretty slick.
Yea it reminds me a saber sometimes when I do that xD I actually finished it but I’m trying to figure out how to do a left click
Basically, yes. It's a nice syntax for applying higher-order functions and hiding the original, wrapped function.
I use memorization in reactive web development all the time.
Yes, / works everywhere, but the c: doesn't.
How many times have you seen memoization demonstrated by not using fibonacci?
If you code only in python you can go community only. If you mix python and JavaScript the pro is a must.
Not many,and I don't particularly care for the sequence either. But this is stuff mostly targeted at newcomers, and will be more likely to ring a bell and activate some neural pathways.
How many times have you used memoization in your line of work? The real issue here is whether memoization is all that useful apart from preventing people from footgunning themselves with a recursive fib().
At least thrice (data science). Saved a lot of computational time (or some development time to make a performant and bug-free version :p) in those situations. If you can't find a useful case in your everyday work doesn't mean it's useless entirely. Whether it should be in the stdlib is another question, if course, but standardization of util functions is usually a good thing imo.
Short but very informative.
What's wrong with os.path.join?
thanks a ton!
the keynote was of no-use to anyone not at the venue. it appears to be just "here's where everything is". Or did I miss something?
Considering I write embedded code for a living, there are lots of things I never use. That's why I'm asking you. It pegs my suspiciometer that almost all demonstrations of memoization are alike. Most of the other basic concepts have a much wider range of examples employed.
Don't look at the subreddit's sidebar.
A lot of the time it's useful just for lazy evaluation. That is, you pretend the function is a map/dict, except the value is computed only if you need it. You don't have to worry about writing `my_cache.get(values, my_calc_function(values))` and getting it right; you just `@lru_cache` your function and get on with life (usually when working in a notebook environment, or running custom module code in a REPL). A specific use case would be comparing how well a tweak in my machine learning model works (changing input parameters), but without writing a lot of stuff around it (since I am likely to throw away/heavily refactor the code anyways). I didn't include the lazy eval use-case in my "at least thrice" comment since it's just "helpful" rather than "very useful" in this way.
Back before pathlib existed, I drilled into my head the habit of ONLY ever using `os.path.join` and `os.path.split` to handle paths; I never hardcode slashes. Does pathlib aide beyond this?
Ashamed I never knew about `functools.lru_cache`; I can finally remove my homegrown `memoized`.
No idea what DP is; memoizing is used in parsing/language applications and caching is extremely useful for example when implementing FFT. I've also used it in database interaction iirc
Very detailed. I like this! Thanks.
[removed]
I really don't like PySimpleGUI. its MVC is pretty much completely fucked up and I would not want to use code from someone who thinks putting everything into a 6000 lines of code module is a good idea.
To add onto this: everyone knows fib and it's an easy example to show the principle - as is faculty calculation. You could of course choose FFT as an example but the maths would probably put most people off
The fact is that everything can be done with for loops. The question is - is it easier to do it recursively?
FFFFFFFFFF
This is a /r/learnpython question and you can probably just call np.hstack on it.

Much higher readability and better tooling support.

Oh shit! A real live person for a change. Sorry for tagging you as yet another b0rken spambot.
[This page](https://pyformat.info/) has lots of good examples of old %-style and newer str.format() strings. It also lists several cases with new functionality that % can't do. Granted some of those are esoteric, but there you have it.

Just released version 3.3.0 of my web platform for C and Python. (https://kore.io/releases/3.3.0). Going to continue updating the documentation under the week and migrating some existing services to the new release.
You can also just use `str`s.
Python's growth is somewhat overstated. Firstly because all these indexes use sites like Stackoverflow, Google searches, etc as metrics. The problem with these is they are biased towards learning languages and "starter" languages, which doesn't correlate on a 1:1 basis with what is actually being used in the real world. Secondly a lot of Python's growth is in Data Science, so whilst that is of use to some extent in that you get jobs like Data Engineers out of it, for a an actual CS type dev a lot of the jobs being created aren't an option because they are for people with an MA/PhD in Maths related fields. Thirdly Python is often a sort of secondary requirement or a "nice to have" in a lot of jobs, so they aren't really "Python" jobs as such, even though they will appear in a search of Indeed or somewhere, because they actually require Java or something.
I wrote code that needed to work in both and never had issues with os.path.join

A failure to consider the standard library and how the whole product integrates together is now standard among developers. Last week there was talk about a special debugging directive for f-strings. Do you know what other standard library tool is used for debugging? Answer: `logging`. Do you know what kind of string formatting is supported by it? Answer: `%`

1. /r/learnpython 2. This is platform specific, look into `inotify` on Linux.
It’s not about issues it’s about readability functionality. The Path object offers a lot of helper methods like exists(), open(), is_dir(), resolve() for relative paths and my favorite you can write Path(‘some/path) / ‘dir’ and it returns Path(‘some/path/dir’)
No, I'm definitely using python3, and also wxPython4 =)
Interactive web debugger is a bit clunky but decent enough for up to medium scale projects. I personally like the Google App Engine integration since I use GAE alot and PyCharm simplifies all the yaml files and deployments I need to manage.
We will make a [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) profile when we get the details for our first meetup in August. I feel the same sentiment with Facebook, but it is the most aligned platform for our goal to transform Miami into a tech hub. So our main information exchange will be on our Facebook Group page. [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pythonmiami](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pythonmiami)
Correct, it's pip installable as outlined in the [Readme and docs](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org).
Sure! In a utility module or file in my project I'll have some thing like this: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ```python import argparse def with_cmd_line_args(f) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): p = argparse.ArgumentParser() p.add_argument("-f", "--file-name", type=str, help="Input file name") p.add_argument("-t", "--test", action="store_true", default=False, help="Use test instance?") return f(p.parse_args(), *args, **kwargs) ``` Then in my actual script I'll do something like this: ```python from utils import with_cmd_line_args @with_cmd_line_args def main(cmd_line_args): # do stuff if __name__ == "__main__": main() ```
Perhaps you would benefit more from using a dict rather than a numpy array. The hashed nature of a dict would give you a look up time of [O(1) on average.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table). I made a quick example of what this might look like, though sloppy with the string conversions, it gets the point across. import random biomes = {'0,0' : 'desert'} for x in range(0, 1023): for y in range(0, 1023): biomes.update({str(x) + ',' + str(y): random.choice( ['desert', 'plains', 'mountains'] )}) print('Dict is full, check a coordinate') print(biomes['555,127'])
`os.path` does all those things as well. It seems to come down to treating paths as simple strings or smart objects. To me the former makes more sense. Can pathlib easily rename `somepath/somefile.txt` to `somepath_foo/somefile_bar.txt`? If not then I need to work with strings. I also feel that the smart objects of pathlib aren't smart enough. They should dictate more policy: mandate file extensions, restrict certain valid but problematic characters, etc. Since it doesn't do that, I just use strings.
Nothing I guess? ``` full_path = os.path.expanduser(path) assert os.path.exists(full_path) print(os.path.basename(full_path)) db_path = os.path.join(full_path, "data.db") app_path = os.path.join(full_path, "app") assert os.path.exists(app_path) ``` The small things do matter. ``` full_path = pathlib.Path.home() / path assert full_path.exists() print(full_path.name) db_path = full_path / "data.db" app_path = full_path / "app" assert app_path.exists() ``` Seems like `pathlib`'s main advantage is it makes use of more readable methods extensively, and that it's generally got better names for the various functions as a result. I'm guessing the main reason for this pattern is that parens are annoying. Is it too late to remove parens in Python? Yeah probably, but a man can always dream.
Isn't it basically a kind of benchmark right now? Not complicated to understand, but a good example of language features and limitations
It was never the intention of pathlib to replace os.path. It’s intention is to provide an object oriented aproach to paths. For some use cases you want you paths to be objects, for others you want them to be strings. Like many things in life there isn’t a golden bullet for everything.
Things you're probably not using in Python 3 -- but should: Python 3
First is python2 so you need to install it on your machine. When you have python installed run the script like this : 1. Go on the same directory where you have stored the script 2. Open a terminal or command prompt 3. Type python the_name_of_the_script.py /path/to/pictures.svg

 That means there are two approaches. Which is more pythonic? Which is recommended? What will be supported in the next major python version? And what will be deprecated or removed? As a developer, I need to know the answers to these questions. I don't think anyone does. I don't think the python core devs are even considering these questions.
As the bot has told you before, this kind of post is better suited for /r/learnpython
&gt;Tier Solution help needed for a proposed server-side web application using python moving over to learnpython. thanks for the heads up. Also no bot mentioned this but I could have missed it.
No, but everything can be done with while loops
full-stack means: we are too poor to pay for specialists that do their job right, so we hire a kid that pretend he can do everything and really generates a pile of poo, then we'll have to hire a bunch of consultants to slap some duct tape on it when it inevitably collapses.
That renames the inode. I'm talking about a very different use case: take a path and apply some kind of string substitution operation to it. For instance suppose your process is supposed to backup a file and put a datestamp into the filename. So `contacts.txt` becomes `contacts_20190515.txt`. Does pathlib support that? Or does one have to break it down into strings and build a new path from strings?
pyenv loves you and wants you to be happy. We use it to stand up needed versions of Python on any host where we need it.
Wonderful! Best of luck, it's on the edge of fitting in that sub, but since you're asking about the reasonability of the stack I think it'll fit in and you'll get more useful help there. WRT the bot: It would have been a commenter on a previous post of yours. For the time being it isn't allowed to comment on posts by the same user twice and instead it notifies me when it wants to comment. This prevents it from being too spammy and acts as a way for me to keep tabs on its accuracy.
You'll have better luck posting this at r/learnpython
Yes, you absolutely can. /r/learnpython can help you from here.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Post your code and the inputs.
I haven't tried, happy to hear a user case or issues [https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues)
This should be almost instantaeous - check your implementation of the algorithm. The simplest way to do this would be a standard flood fill algorithm (see wikipedia and and not some random site as you won't at this stage know if it's a good site or not). You'll need to do a pass for each biome type. It's not the quickest way, but it'll work.
Thank you so much for your reply. I'll look into it.
 no. 1 is f-strings. That's what I was hoping would be in the list. So good.
Doesn't work. It's a different biome if it's the same terrain type but not connected.
Yeah but a while loop can be done with a for loop.
In SciPy's `ndimage` module there are two functions that might help you: `find_objects` and `label`.
Great point. Especially since, as part of trying to OOP and get the benefits of reducing code duplication, it means that a change in one function can quickly spiral out and affect a bunch of other functions. I don't have too many return values since Python doesn't care too much about just modifying variables (less or essentially no enforcement of global vs local) , but I will test the variables after each function. &amp;#x200B; Question about my run function - it's essentially a loop that only ends when the user hits ctrl-C. Is there a way to unit test this?
I'm working through automate the boring stuff! I just finished the manipulating strings chapter and started reading about GUI automation so I can build an auto clicker for a random idle clicker game. I know C and C++, but start the OMSC for gatech in fall and wanted to get somewhat decent at python by then. I'm having way more fun than I expected with this language :)

1) I looked into updating my applications a few years ago. At the time, there was a project called Esky that was getting a lot of hype. The maintainer of wxPython actually added Esky support to wxPython itself in `wx.lib.softwareupdate`. You can read more about that here: * https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/wx.lib.softwareupdate.html * https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2013/07/12/wxpython-updating-your-application-with-esky/ I don't cover this topic in the book though. That might be a good one to add however. 2) Sadly I don't have any experience with OpenGL, so I'm probably not the best person to ask. I do know that wxPython has a GLCanvas widget that let's you do a little OpenGL within wxPython. PyOpenGL used to be popular, but I'm not sure what the status of that project is nowadays. Personally I think that would be a fun project though. 3) Kind of. I created a really simple GUI for Python's `ftplib` that calls out to FTP servers and does operations on them. I am actually planning on continuing to enhance that project as it was really interesting. I hope that answers your questions. If not, feel free to ask for clarifications

Where's your code?
We do the same with anaconda. Our Python stuff has a strong history in our analytics environment, so anaconda is all sorts of useful there. But now we use anaconda for everything else too.
As a developer you should be more preocupied by which one makes more sense to your current application. No code ever stays the same and deprecations are part of the normal application life-cycle.
Great feedback, thanks! We'll work on adding that soon
Pretty sure this happens when you dont add python to the system path, right? So maybe look up a video on YouTube about that and it should solve the problem.
My personal practice is to avoid reassigning to the same name, *except* in the case of an optional argument with default value None. My reasoning is that it makes code easier to read because you always know the value of any variable. I also use Scala on a daily basis, where reassignment is generally considered a Bad Thing, so it helps to build that habit.
I think the paragraph on 2 vs 3 is unnecessary. &gt;Since the release of the new version of Python, that is Python 3, there has been a bit of a debate in the coding community about which python version is better. Whether python 3 is better than python 2 or not is a rather subjective question and the selection between the two eventually comes down to the personal preference but one must know how Python 2 and Python 3 are different. Python 3 is a fundamentally different version from Python 2. Python 2 is for all intents and purposes irrelevant to the discussion of learning python. It is soon to be of concern only to maintainers of legacy code.
I think the most important thing I learned, is just exactly how much I have yet to learn.
I don't really understand the purpose for enums. Is this something primarily used in other languages that was ported over, or is this something super useful that all Python users should know and use?
They are both perfectly capable of doing the job. There are no issues using either, and neither is obviously better. What is a big concern is that I work in a corporate environment where server lifetimes are 5-10 years. The python version I deploy now, will probably be in use in 2030. The code I write today, will probably be in use on the same python interpreter in 2030. There will be maintenance and features added, but if it works it won't be changed. So for me, "Python4" is a real concern. If I write things "the wrong way" for the next version of python, I will have to rewrite it all. I don't want to do that.
Wauw, a clickbait title that actually lives up to its expectations. I'm truly impressed. Thanks.
Yes logging with `%` is annoying. If f-strings or `.format` is recommended it should also be in logger
i was recently reading in the py3.0 documentation about them deprecating %-style. then i got to &gt;3.0 documentation and saw they put it back. weird, guess people complained
This is a good list to start with. I'd recommend everyone to look at the changelogs as there are some hidden gems there. Some of the well-known and not so well-known are: * The `yield from` syntax introduced in 3.3. This has completely changed the way generators and coroutines are done in python. See this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26109157/2116081) for a hint on what it can do. * Support for asynchronous programming absent in Python 2 with `async` and `await` (now keywords), asynchronous generators and comprehensions etc. * The [os.scandir()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) function which allows much faster searching of directories than `os.listdir`. The `os.walk()` was reimplemented in `os.scandir` making it at least 3-10 times faster in different OS * The format string is awesome but there is another very convenient thing no one talks about. You can use conversion specifiers r, s and a to easily convert between `repr`, `str` and `ascii` forms. Example below (from python docs): &amp;#8203; &gt;&gt;&gt; street = 'Gürzenichstraße' ; print(f"The street is {street!a}") The street is 'G\xfcrzenichstra\xdfe' &gt;&gt;&gt; message = "Hello World" &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"Message: {message!r}") Message: 'Hello World' &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"Message: {message}") Message: Hello World * For users of scientific/numerical computing there is [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#module-statistics) module in standard library which provides common functions like mean, median, stdev etc. out of the box. * Now you can compare floating point numbers using `math.isclose()` function which checks if the numbers are within specified precision. * The `tracemalloc` module to provide detailed memory allocation reports which can help trace memory leakage and other system level debugging. * The iterator unpacking is much more powerful and flexible now than the 3.0 version shown in the post. For example one can have arbitrary number of unpackings. Tuples, dicts etc support multiple unpacking. For example (from docs) &amp;#8203; &gt;&gt;&gt; def fn(a, b, c, d): ... print(a, b, c, d) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; fn(**{'a': 1, 'c': 3}, **{'b': 2, 'd': 4}) 1 2 3 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; {'x': 1, **{'y': 2}} {'x': 1, 'y': 2} Also namespace story is far more subtle (the author has addressed that).
@dataclass doesn't seem to me to be out of line with how the decorators @classmethod, @staticmethod, @property, etc are used. the codebase i work on at my company makes frequent use of namedtuples, which i really like the concept of. however, i've found that IDE inspection and refactoring of the namedtuple's attributes to be awkward. introducing a standardized, easy substitution for that seems advantageous.
It's not Python only, but Selenium is amazing for web scraping
And if logging can't be fixed, and there isn't interest in it, then deprecate it. Just tell me what I as a developer should be doing to prepare for python4.

I mean in c you can use for (;;) as a while true loop. does this work in python without defining an infinite iterator class? otherwise I was just referring to loop programs vs while programs and how loop programs are not turing complete

yep, it's spelled fourier ;)
Makes my spelling look really dumb. Thanks for the response though!
haha and no problem
You should post it on r/django, you will probably get more feedbacks :)
Never used it, I suppose it would work. I don't see the benefit of using it though, the only benefit of it is that you only call a single command, but mypy also has a lot of options I'm not sure if you are losing some control. Some tools might call mypy incorrectly, I saw plug-in for pytest which seemed to invoke mypy for every file, when you should generally check entire project at once (one file calls fictions in another etc and you need these relationships to check types)
In general you want to avoid the overhead of formatting a log string if it isn't going to be emitted. Of all the string formatting methods available, the only one to fulfil that, is *string modulus tuple*.

&gt; @dataclass doesn't seem to me to be out of line &gt; with how the decorators @classmethod, @staticmethod, @property, etc are used. not exactly. This is the first time where executable code is generated in response to an annotation. By spirit of the PEP 3107, an annotation is basically an "enhanced docstring". However, I just re-read PEP-484 (type hints) introduction and I change my stance. They were quite clear that it was the goal https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#rationale-and-goals So yeah, I'm wrong :P
A bad maintenance cycle is the users fault, in your case the corporate entity that does not update it’s application / dependencies more often. If you are so worried about using a new feature, read the PEP that introduced it.
Crowd sourcing project ideas for school? I wish I had thought of this for my final group project.
my coworkers have written lots of stuff with decorators that i find difficult/inconsistent. i'm used to them in terms of an annotation, like you shared. however while ramping up on this codebase i have seen them used in variety of ways: \- strictly checking the arguments to the method they're decorating \- allowing/disallowing actions. i.e., @feature\_name.on to allow the method to do use a new feature \- enable caching (sort of like a hand-rolled predecessor to @lru\_cache) all in all, i find it to be fairly confusing to know what the intent is. thanks for sharing that pep link, hoping to learn more.
Currently working on a package to simulate the behavior and maintenance of manufacturing systems. It's my first "big" software project and I'd be happy to get any feedback at all if someone decides to take a look: https://github.com/m-hoff/maintsim
No, this isn't an API actually. It's just useful Python snippets using COM :)
The pickle module lets you take an arbitrary data object (list, dict, string, etc) and save it to a file in a serialized format. think of it like taken data out of ram and writing it to a file. There are dangers to pickling because you can also serialize things like functions. Never load a pickle that you did not make, or don't know where it came from. I do not recommend to use the pickle module store json data. Json is a serialized format and does not support functions. It should be much safer than pickle. Just use json.dumps() to make a json "string" and write that string to a file. You can reverse the process by reading the string back from the file and using json.loads() to convert it back into a data object.
I tend to use pathib as much as possible (and have done so since the release of Python 3.5 - I still have a lot of no-longer-necessary "as_posix()" calls hanging around), so I've only experienced it from that direction. What do you tend to run across difficulty with using `os.path`?
Or a `Path` object's built-in `as_posix` method (or `as_uri` where that makes more sense)
I didn't say it was an API ;) just that someone created a Python Library/Module which gives access to Photoshop-Scripting... :) Have you tried out this Python module yet? Does it do what you want it to?
I'm guilty of py3 code looking like py2 ... I didn't know about fstrings 👍
Pickle takes some object/class/function/whatever and converts (marshals) it to a stream of bytes that can be saved to a file or sent over the network. Unpickling takes that stream of bytes and rehydrates (unmarshals) it to form a live object, with all the properties and methods the original one had. Unpickling untrusted data is a recipe for arbitrary code execution. This is explicitly stated in the pickle docs. Don't do it. There isn't a strong guarantee that data pickled by one version of python will be unpicklable with another version of python. And generally not unpickleable with not-python. Don't do it. The json module dumps (serializes) python lists, dicts and primitive types (int, str, bool, etc) to a string that can be written to a file or sent over the network. The json module in just about every language can safely load (unserialize) that string into lists/dicts/etc. Do this. Depending on the version of python (and the modules) involved, one or the other is faster. It's unlikely that matters. More reading: /r/learnpython and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2259270/pickle-or-json and https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)
This is an incredible list. The amount of instructional material that is available is almost overwhelming. Who needs college? If I were a kid (I'm 77) I would immerse myself in videos like these and become proficient in 6 months.
I would love that as well.

Haha this is why golang don’t have while. Just for.
Not at all. That's why I wrote my own module. This is a very high-level approach (e.g. shift an image 10degrees to the right). My functionality is much more low-level e.g. `create_a_new_layer_from_file`. The reason I can't open-source it (yet) is that it is internal code but I'm going to re-write an open source version of it ;) That's why I need some tips/pointers/tutorial on how to go from a module to a proper API :)

Well, it is possible, but it will take you longer than to write a similar application 😊
ah ok, I think I'm following you now. So what kind of API do you want to create? The most common is a REST Web API, but there are other kinds as well. Do you specifically want to make a library just for Python?

OP here. Looks like a new feature since our work in 2018. Thanks for sharing
Yes for Python. No interest to expand in other languages as that is supposedly covered by Adobe (not really but again 🤷‍♂️) It may well be that what I want is just to create proper class/module/python program than I can package, install via pip and re-use in future programs and the usage of term API is totally irrelevant 🤦🏻‍♂️
You can translate assembly to C using IDA pro and other decompilers...
This isn't quite true. \`'%s' % 's'\` isn't lazy. The logging module lazy evaluates the log statement, you call \`[logging.info](https://logging.info)('%s', 's')\`, and the logging module puts things together for you later. The standard library could add support for any log format, the problem is that logging relies heavily on global state, so opting in to the new logging format on a per method/file basis would be necessary, and that's not fun. Plus you don't gain much. &amp;#x200B; That said, you shouldn't be logging \`foo=%s' % foo\` much anyway,
I'm not sure that argument holds. `log.debug("status: {status}", status=status)` Wouldn't this still allow you to defer the formatting of the string until the log line is emitted, and would also support {} style formatting.
Yeah, Python tends to be more of an auxiliary skill in these job listings or it's paired with some other barrier, like a doctorate as you mentioned.
OP here. Celery looks great - esp. because it connects to a queue of data. Could you clarify what you mean for extending easily via Airflow?
Something like this perhaps: from pathlib import Path file = Path('./test1/test.txt') new_location = Path('./test2') new_location.mkdir(exist_ok=True) new_name = Path(file.stem + "_bar" + file.suffix) file.rename(new_location / new_name)
Yes you can but the source will not be similar. And one use-case for compiling is to obfuscate and protect your code.
Every time I go back to look at old code, I tell myself I should have used type hinting.

Using GRPC, you define the service and create a connection to the service. This connection is long lived (often for the life of the program), and expensive to create (maybe a second, not a cost you want to pay on every RPC). So you want a singleton. The classic way in python is something like &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` \_my\_connection = None def get\_connection(): global \_my\_connection if \_my\_connection: return \_my\_connection else: conn = expensive\_create\_connection() \_my\_connection = conn return conn \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; you can optimize for LoC a bit, but that's the basic idea. Now using lru\_cache: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` @functools.lru\_cache def get\_connection():return expensive\_create\_connection() \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Similarly, when actually making an RPC that may be reused, lru-caches (or caches with a ttl, or both) can have enormous performance impacts, and reduce QPS load on external services in cases where you're calling something with sometimes similar arguments in tight loops or across threads. &amp;#x200B; I recently had a situation where memoizing a single, specific, expensive RPC + deserialization step dropped startup time of a tool from like 45 minutes to less than 1. The RPC + deserialize step was done lots, and lots of times, for various specific parts of essentially a large map. By memoizing the resultant map, I reduced the number of deserializations from literally thousands to exactly 1. Much better.
I believe pylint will warn of dependencies that cannot be imported. That said, if you create a set of tests that at least import every one of your modules, all simple syntax errors and such should be caught in those tests.
I learned f-strings in a book I was reading about Py3 and I like how much nicer it makes things look in my code vs the Python 2 way.
Not understanding...paying respect
Beautiful soup or scrappy would be good to get the data. Schedule a job to run every n minutes, get the http response, parse/search with beautiful soup (or xpath search), and if getter than some default, send an alert. Also, you probably only want to send the message when it crosses the threshold. Otherwise, you'll get a message every n minutes.
That sentence looks very pythonic.
That's true.
I think we do use firebase. I don't in what I do, but other people do. In terms of part time work I honestly don't know. I was at pycon doing the recruiting and picked up the answer to the non-engineering questions, but I don't think that one came up. I'd say get in touch through the web page, worst that can happen is they say it can't work.
Sadly, for data security reasons, our lawyers restrict these to people in the U.S.
Thank you! I would suggest taking a read of [this article from a fellow speaker friend](https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/) and [one from the former program committee chair](http://www.njl.us/essays/pycon-talks/). They give some solid advice on proposing talks. Good luck!
Certainly doesn't hurt. I was mostly Flask in the few years before I started, so I don't think it's any kind of deal breaker.
It's how it always goes.
&gt; `new_name = Path(file.stem + "_bar" + file.suffix)` is the key line in that. With os.path its something like: path, file = os.path.split(filename) file, ext = os.path.splitext(file) newfile = os.path.join(path, file + "_bar" + ext) I don't see a massive improvement over `os.path`. In both cases you break it down into strings and rebuild it. It would be cool if you could in some way "template" filenames: TemplatedPath("contacts_{:%Y%m%d}.txt", (date,)) and then have a "path-like" object that needs a date to be materialized into a proper string or path.
Yes. Check out `imaplib` and perhaps Google's gmail API if you're using that.
&gt; That said, you shouldn't be logging `foo=%s' % foo` much anyway, Then why did they add it to f-strings? It is a perfectly sensible way to do debugging, and `logging` has a defined DEBUG level. To me its a symptom of a serious disconnect between the writers of these PEPs and the standard library.
To complement the comments already here: if your data requires pickle for serialization, consider using [`dill`](https://pypi.org/project/dill/) instead (assuming you can afford the extra dependency). It can serialize a broader range of types, which means you won't get a nasty surprise when you have to serialize a decorated function (ask me how I know ;) )
The primary difficulty is that `logging` doesn't know that it should call `.format` instead of `%` and that might vary from module to module. A downloaded module might use `%` but your code might use `.format`. So its not trivially easy to fix. I think it needs to be fixed, and we aren't going to fix it, then deprecate the `logging` module. As it stands we have a string formatting method that we aren't "supposed" to be using because it is old and antiquated... except in logging where we have to use it.
Cool. Best of luck.
 from itertools import count for _ in count(): blah
Backwards compat. They couldn’t just break all logging code. You can do `logging.basicConfig(style='{')` but I think that breaks every other library using the `logging.root` logger. Instead, you’ll have to create your own logging module: import logging root = logging.RootLogger() class Logger(logging.Logger): pass Logger.root = root Logger.manager = logging.Manager(Logger.root) def setup(): handler = logging.StreamHandler() handler.formatter = Formatter(style='{') root.addHandler(handler) def get_logger(name=None): if name: return Logger.manager.getLogger(name) else: return root This works exactly the same as the normal logging module, except that 1. `root` and all loggers created via `get_logger` support the format/f-literal syntax (By using `root`’s handler) 2. Instead of calling `logging.basicSetup(...)` once, you call `setup()` once, which you configure by editing its code instead of passing options (as it’s your module) 3. It has no convenience `info`/`warning`/… functions, as you should use `get_logger` anyway.
Oh for sure, but it's misleading to say that it cannot be reverse engineered and then when you do reverse engineer it, you have to be able to read and speak assembly. I just don't like it when people mislead others who haven't been exposed to this area of software development and make it sound spooky and harder than it is.
I'm aware of the why. I don't care. There are too damn many string formatting methods as it is. We don't need more. Either find a way to make it work, or deprecate logging, or stop adding new string formatting methods.
If you do anything with CSVs, Pandas is great. I'm a huge Excel user, but I'm starting to slow down on Excel and use Pandas almost exclusively. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjm-zzob6H8) is phenomenal for learning Pandas.
That only applies to f-strings. You can defer `.format` exactly like you can defer `%`. In fact, the logging module supports `Formatter(style='{')` which will do the exact same as the default `Formatter(style='%')`, except that it uses `.format` syntax.

&gt;It is a perfectly sensible way to do debugging, and logging has a defined DEBUG level. To me its a symptom of a serious disconnect between the writers of these PEPs and the standard library. The same reason that \`pdb\` and \`logging\` can coexist. Logging at DEBUG and interactive debugging are different things. {foo=} is very useful for interactive debugging. But, much in the same way that you shouldn't go decorating all of your methods with a decorator that debug-logs the arguments passed, you shouldn't go permanently adding visual noise to both your log files and your code. In other words, not all logging should get checked in or be permanent, some is just to debug temporary issues and figure out why your assumptions may have been violated.
This is very true. I didn't appreciate type hinting until I was reading through a library the other day where everything had typing on it, and it was a million times easier to work out what the functions did by knowing exactly what their inputs and outputs were going to be from the first line.
I updated it. Thanks!
import requests url="your URL here" response=str(requests.get(url).content) searchtag="""&lt;td class="AQDataLg"&gt;""" start=response.find(searchtag)+len(searchtag) end=response.find("&lt;/td&gt;",start) quality=response[start:end] if response="USG": #email alert The above checks the current quality. A bit more work to do the email. Then you also need to decide how you make it not alert too often. You could run an ongoing process that stores the prior value and only sends on a change, or could write current value to a for or database, and check that for change, or just run once per day 30 minutes before class. How you schedule the job friend on your operating system.
&gt; log.debug("status: {status}", status=status) &gt;&gt;&gt; logging.debug("status: {status}", status=status) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'status' is not defined Passing in a dictionary "works", but probably not in an informative way: DEBUG:root:status: {status}
See my answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bot638/things_youre_probably_not_using_in_python_3_but/enmyfkx/) for what you can do. The best way would of course be to have a 1-liner that gives you something that can create loggers with `{}`\-formatting for use in your module, while everything else still uses the `%`\-formatting it expects.
The proper term would be static variables. I believe the python term would be function attributes
This is for the person staying in the college or office who know the fundamental of deep learning and have read about it but don't get an opportunity to implement much things specially with the help of library. I mean if one have taken up the course then mostly everyone give assignments in the python and uses numpy and even the neural networks are implemented with the help of numpy. I assume that the person have idea of how things work. Sorry that my line "heard of deep learning" may attract different target audience and thank you for giving me the review. I will change the line and also for those who have just heard of things I should write some blog where I have explained things at a greater depth. But doing so in the code doesn't seem to be a good option. I would like to thank you for your review and I definitely will change the line of my post so that it don't attract different target audience. Thank you once again.
Attribute access? r/learnpython
You're right. However that's not an f-string, and to me cumbersome and repetitive.
In Python, functions are also objects. Thereby, they can have attributes (variables and such) and methods (internal functions).
Sure! So Airflow is a workflow scheduler, with multiple different types of “Executors”, or how the work actually gets done. For smaller deployments, people use the LocalExecutor, which runs multiple processes on the same machine. Multiple processes, in this scenario, wouldn’t help. Another executor is the CeleryExecutor. This means that when work gets scheduled, it gets fired off into the celery queue, and picked up by a worker. Meaning that if you’re able to break up your work, you’re able to run multiple chunks in parallel on any worker listening to your queue. Basically, Airflow’s main purpose would be to add scheduling, which is often needed when executing workflows. You’d essentially be able to add a nice chunk of functionality for a small amount of work!
r/learnpython
They put back %-style formatting for bytes objects to simplify implementing binary protocols. I think %-style is still to be depreciated for str objects. str.format is more powerful but more verbose. The new f-string fix the verbosity issue and further increase the flexibility by allowing full expressions as "{&lt;expr&gt;}". There is no f-bytes syntax.
Thanks for the links! I'll give those a read and go from there.

&gt; But doing so in the code doesn't seem to be a good option. But that's the beauty of jupyter notebooks. You can treat it as a lab manual and insert markdown cells without the need to make long explicit comments in your code. From there it can easily be downloaded as a .py file and the markdown cells removed.

easier to type?
Imaplib only takes date not time or I just did not get it. Not sure. Also I'm not using Gmail it's iCloud.
A simple google search yields a much better discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3742580/python-why-elif-keyword http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html &gt;The keyword elif is short for 'else if', and is useful to avoid excessive indentation.
Yes, It's way less verbose and way more autocomplete friendly. Plus it forces you to operate on the path type, going back to a string takes more effort. The effect is that you naturally do the right thing.
But *you can* find each message's `datetime`, so it's possible to get all mail from a certain date and then filter them. It might get out of hand if we're talking multiple thousands of emails. By the way, it's IMAP itself that doesn't support searching by time, so this is not a limitation of `imaplib` per se.

Btw, yes. Good point. Worth to extend
what is the difference between r/python and r/learnpython?
From the sidebar over there --&gt; &gt;1.belongs in /r/learnpython &gt; &gt;If you are about to ask a question about how to do something in python, please check out /r/learnpython. It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand.
There's nothing elegant about it. And everyone knows about it because it's the same lazy, stupid fucking example used in every textbook and tutorial by people who can't be arsed to use an actually useful and relevant example. Recursion is an important concept and students often have a hard time with it. It deserves better than an example that literally nobody will ever use for anything other than an example of recursion. There are plenty of situations where recursion is used in a real world scenario. Use something interesting, like parsing or adding all the numbers in a list.
Fffffuuuuuuuuu
Thank you!
How many newcomers know or care enough about Fibonacci that their first example of recursion should be done using it? "AHA I GET IT IT'S TOTALLY LIKE THIS THING WE TALKED ABOUT ONCE IN 10TH GRADE AND I HAVEN'T GIVEN A FUCK ABOUT SINCE"
Upvote - that's obvious. Monkey - borrowed from Blender? :D Beside of that - seriosuly, you are 15? :D Man, I hope to have some time to get known with your code...really exciting to watch your progress here :)
Thanks! Yes, the monkey is borrowed from Blender :)
Yeah I don't see the point of `Path`. The other examples are cool though.
Yeah that would be great, let me work on that and thanks for the great tip.
&gt;The keyword elif is short for 'else if', and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. Not really a good reason IMO. I would assume anyone arguing for `else if` would want it implemented as shown in the StackOverflow question: if a: print("a") else if b: print("b") else: print("c")
Combining f-strings with Path properties makes that kind of substitution very easy and readable. For your particular example, it's one line with less than 80 characters. from pathlib import Path pth = Path("/path/to/somepath/somefile.txt") new_pth = Path(f"{pth.parent}_foo", f"{pth.stem}_bar{pth.suffix}") There are 2 advantages to this method: 1. You don't clutter up all your code with `os.path` prefixes 2. The `pathlib` gives you access to all parts of the path as properties. With `os.path`, you can't access the `stem` and `suffix` properties of a path separately. You have to split the filename out, then split the suffix separately. The equivalent code to the above: import os pth = "/path/to/somepath/somefile.txt" dirname, filename = os.path.split(pth) basename, ext = os.path.splitext(filename) new_pth = os.path.join(f"{dirname}_foo", f"{basename}_bar{ext}")
Nothing. I just think using pathlib is easier to use and makes for better code. Sometimes treating paths as strings can get a bit messy, which usually happens less when using pathlib.
This works as well, which may be closer to what you are talking about. In this example, I only created the "newname" variable to show that you can substitute it into the f-string that I used, to demonstrate that the names can be changed programmatically without breaking it down into strings first. from pathlib import Path newname = 'test_bar' file = Path('./test1/test.txt') new_location = Path('./test2') new_location.mkdir(exist_ok=True) file.rename(new_location / file.with_name(f'{newname}.txt').name) You could do the whole thing in this manner if you wanted: file.rename(f'{new_path}/{new_name}{new_ext}') But this does require that the target directory already exists. That is the main reason I split the two and use mkdir. There is another similar method called with_suffix() that allows you to just change the extension as well. As for it being better than os.path, I guess that is an individual thing. I'm sure there are things os.path does better, most of my experience is with pathlib so I really wouldn't know to be honest.
Even if you're using so much RAM that the OS starts to page, I would imagine the OS is much smarter about it than anything you could do on your end. Hard drives are so incredibly slow compared to RAM that good memory management to prevent paging should be your goal. You could read [Python's Memory Management](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html) documentation. [Here's](https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_linkers_and_virtual_memory.html) an old PyCon presentation (caveat: some of this information might be a little out of date, I don't know). [RealPython article](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/) on Python's memory management. Can you explain your app a little more? Do you want it to do the recording, or the playback, or both?
Alright sounds good, thanks.
Thanks that sorted it! I will be sure to let you know if I run into any problems. I've never used an IDE but Spyder so I'm not sure what that uses. All of my interactive programs until this one have been fairly slow however. It's the blitting which gave me the best performance boost
I use Fibonacci in reactive web development all the time.
A series of functions all returning False.
Thanks. I really tried googling this, but only got hundreds of tutorials on how the if/elif/else works 😅
Yes, but it needs explaining only once, and briefly.
Actually, scratch that. from itertools import repeat for _ in repeat(None): blah
Interesting. How well does it play with the remote server dropping the connection, or any of the other typical cases of "Caching is hard"? It might be the Paranoia Driven Development methodology used in at least part of the code I work with in my day time job, but I'd be wary memoizing anything but an idempotent function.
I think it might be because Python `if` statements don't use a parenthesis for the conditional statement. Probably easier to tell the interpretor to look for `elif x == 3` than `else if x == 3`. Also less confusing to someone reading the code because they won't confuse `else` as the start of the conditional statement.
&gt; Interesting. How well does it play with the remote server dropping the connection, or any of the other typical cases of "Caching is hard"? I've yet to have any bad experiences, and internally I think this pattern is used thousands of times across hundreds of services, in both short and long running jobs, without any issues. I don't actually know the ins-and-outs of the connection object, it may do some/all of the state management.
The app takes a continuous feed and runs it on an adjustable delay (so an athlete can do something, then immediately watch themselves do it), while also performing some further analysis of the feed (right now just motion detection, but I'd like to add some additional features down the road). I intend to add a pause function at some point, coupled with a frame-by-frame step forward/backward, allowing athletes and/or coaches to pause at key points to analyze technique. Thanks, by the way; what you've given me so far should be enormously helpful
agreed. it still irks me whenever I need to use % formatting in logging calls. maybe a logging2 module, or add support for % vs {} formatting into the logger objects directly, rather than in the formatters? IIRC the formatters are what ultimately do the string interpolation?
sorry, that was just a sample of what logging with {} could look like. unfortunately, it doesn't work right now.
I don’t know
Keep your own if you need to handle `list` and such.
Even for people who do need one without this, it's what - 2 lines? But this requires infinite recursion into the filesystem in order to find python files, which you can't disable, it's definitely a bad idea.
Despite my initial reservation on the security implications... f-strings are nice and I use them a lot now.
Think about APIs. Caching is useful in web techs.
If two tuples refer to the same object (`a[0] is b[0]`), the comparison code doesn't bother asking that object whether it's equal to itself. If you create two tuples that refer to different NaNs, you'll get the less-surprising behavior where the float type's `__eq__` is called and returns False: In [10]: a = float('nan'), In [11]: b = float('nan'), In [12]: a[0] is b[0] Out[12]: False In [13]: a == b Out[13]: False
You know that caching things alongside naming are th three hard problems in CS, right? It does not become any less hard by having a decorator do it.
Double word statements are weird and almost always unclear in behavior. You're never sure if they're 2 things or 1 thing. It makes sense to merge words for better understanding of the unique behavior of a stament. I don't think making a more verbose statement is ever of any help. For example there's nothing clear about `async def` vs `def` or `async with` vs `with`. These things could of been named `adef` and `awith` and they'd of been exactly as confusing, if not less because they're clearly one word.

Yeah I'm doing the same thing, fetching all mails and using the date to convert it to timestamp and sort it. But due to high volume, it takes lot of time. Also, for imaplib https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52054196/python-imaplib-search-email-with-date-and-time
You literally made my day.
I understand now. It sounds like a great way to scale an ETL process with low setup needs. Thank you, Alex.
I'm in your shoes. &amp;#x200B; I ended up building a dependency graph using networkx but that was a lot of manual work so I'm actually starting on a project that builds dependency graphs. &amp;#x200B; It's easy to copy a file-system's tree over. I need to dive into Python's inspection utilities. I imagine there's some way to parse import information from various files. I'd then use NetworkX to provide a graph framework for visualization.
Hi OP, in future this sort of post belongs in /r/learnpython. Since people have given you help here I am going to leave this post alone so you can refer to the comments here. All the best.
I'm wondering how much time to spend automating maintenance of the tool that automates issue handling in this application I made.
You are correct it is a new feature. I just found it a few days myself, I have used some of the hacks from the links in your article to a varying degree of success, however they felt rather “hacky”... This is the first solution to slow to_sql bulk inserts that feels like a mature solution and I am actually really glad the pandas devs were able to add this feature.
Enjoy getting into the college of your choice in a few years.
Thanks :)
This is really cool
Thank you
From what I can tell, the type annotations don't have any impact on the actual functioning of the created dataclass; it's more that they are necessary syntax for identifying the dataclass's fields.
Interesting! Thanks for the explanation. This explains some inconsistent behavior I've seen.
Scrapy and beautifulsoup make web scraping a breeze. I find myself using regular expressions to parse things just because it becomes really easy once you’re comfortable with the syntax. I’d recommend using something like https://pythex.org to test them. Need to store what you’ve parsed/scraped? Use redis to store lots of things in memory easily. Need persistence on a disk? Use mongo instead. Need something quick and dirty to store a single thing? Use json and store it to a file. Pickle is a little easier, but the data won’t be easily readable by other languages. The “schedule” library is nice for performing periodic tasks, although I find myself using cron or “while True; sleep” more often. Flask is simple for when you need to run some code remotely. I used it last to make a power supply (that only had a serial interface) controllable over Ethernet. It’s a super old, but super nice, power supply - and for $20 (raspberry pi) and a few hours, now I can go to “&lt;ip address&gt;/enable?channel=1” or “&lt;ip address&gt;/get_voltage?channel=1”. My test scripts ultimately can then control the power supply too :) While it isn’t really a library, I host a Jupyter notebook for anything that needs to be run by other people. I used to try and bundle an environment with libraries included, but I would run into issues with the occasional PC with a weird native python install. I also tried binaries, but that ended up being too much extra work for my applications. The code just changes too often.
If I were you I would definitely include in some manner or form that youve used your self teaching techniques to also farm for karma. :p really nice job dudes! Write up a blog post about these updates you have as well to document your progress on a more personal area. Youre gonna have to have a portfolio anyway might as well sprinkle in some blog posts along the way.
Thanks! I am a single person with not very much experience but I'll definitely consider documenting the progress in a blog
Don't want to write it up on mobile right now but something with one class per parent and one for the child (inheriting from the Parent classes).

Hi, as it happens, I've been working on a small videoannotation applet where I use opencv to read a video file and play it back, and move between frames. It is not much but sounds like it could be helpful for you :). https://github.com/miikama/pyvideoannotate The video reading is inside annotation_holder.py I initially read all the frames into a list as well but that eats a lot of memory fast. Luckily opencv allows you to open a videofile and set the index of the next frame you want to read from file to memory. I haven't checked whether opencv does any internal buffering of frames, probably does.

Fantastic!
Thank you
If you're dumping it straight to a file you can use the more convenient json.dump (and json.load for loading) d = {...} with open("filename", "w") as f: json.dump(d,f) with open("filename") as f: d2 = json.load(f)
I personally love miniconda. Miniconda also lets you get some other software that might be useful like ffmpeg through conda-forge.

Now you should go for Phong shading. Since you have gouraud shading, it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to implement Phong.
Is that susan, the monkey from Blender?
Uhhhh maybe
Even though I wish to be able to do that, I have no idea how to do per-pixel shading. Do I have to use raytracing? If yes, I'm hopeless
PyDrive, xlsxwriter and Python-pptx are three tools that I've used to automate report generation.
Please do! Just a stupid simple GitHub Pages and you are off to the races.. quite easy these days.
Hey, for your rotatePoints function I’m pretty sure you can subtract the centerVector from each vertex once, and then do your rotations, and then add it back at the end. You can probably use one list for this instead of three, or maybe just use the list vertices.
Got it, thanks for noticing
Dude, probably you've already heard that many times, but I think that's not enough emphasis: What you are doing is AWESOME! Being a college student and also a 3D animation enthusiast, I can ensure you that you're conditioned to success! Cheers and have fun
Thank you so much!
Kudos. Prepare to have your mind blown once you learn about matrix algebra. :)
Doesn't matter.
Thanks! I can't wait
Something that some folks seem to enjoy (personally, I'm not a fan) is [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#operators)'s use of the forward slash (`/`) in creating filesystem paths.
One I wrote for fun quite a while ago. https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2015/10/cryptic-reeborg.html
How long have you been programming for? This is amazing
I was _really_ not into it at first, but after working with it for a bit, I'm actually really surprised by how clean it feels compared to `os.path`.
Namely the lim n -&gt; inf fib(n+1)/fib(n). Because aesthetics.
Thanks, I made this in a few weeks (not working continuously)
Good Job, now begin ray-tracing ;-)

How does this compare to [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/)?
I would but i'm afraid it will become self aware
I've got some mental block or something. Every time I've tried it or saw it in the wild, my head just went into instant rejection mode. It's weird... Perhaps one day
Yeah, well, I think a little verbosity is good to make the meaning clear. Anyhow, couldn’t a compromise be “elseif”? (and asyncdef and asyncwith)
You absolutely should. You’ve done amazing work from one iteration to the next, by documenting it in a blog post you are also showing your ability to explain your work. Kudos for being awesome!
Hey, I know this might not like as cool as other posts but if you took the time to take a look at it I really appreciate it . Because as a freshman high schooler, this is a pretty complicated journey for me (or I am just dumb). If you guys want the source code I will upload it to github.
I have no idea what I’m looking at in the code but the results are pretty amazing. Any chance of getting some beginner examples? I think what you’ve built would actually be perfect for something I’ve been pounding my head on my desk for months. It really is pretty badass in my humble opinion, kudos dude.
Thank you, I'll try explaining parts of it in the future so more people can understand what I did and make it better
I feel the same way. I can't say for sure why it feels wrong, but I have afeeling it's because of the noncommutative nature of /. I guess I'd feel the same way about - outside strictly mathematical contexts.

I have been working on a new project with AWS and serverless. its first time in my career when I touch such these technologies (it's not popular in my homeland) and it's interesting. So interesting that I even have been working for more than \~12 hours every day. It has its problems though. To re-deploy something which utilizes vpc it seems that you need to wait around 40 minutes every time. But may be I just doing something wrong? dont know for sure
Thanks for the help. I'm trying to figure out why my code won't complete the operation. I'm trying to automate converting geoPDFs to GeoTIFFs, but I cannot figure out why gdal_translate won't work when I use it in my Python IDLE (2.7).

Great question!. **dictifier** is using queries to serialize an object. A query is nothing but a list of fields to fetch from an object(It also has a way to format it to get nested data, manipulate fields and create new fields). A query corresponds to a schema in **marshmallow,** but on **dictfier** you dont need to predefine it, also the format of query can easily be serialized and deserialized with json library, so you can actually take a query in form of string and load it to serialize your object/model, this concept allowed me to make another library([django-restql](https://github.com/yezyilomo/django-restql)) to convert Django REST API into a GraphQL like API. Sure **marshmallow** has great capability compared to **dictfier** but I think there are some use cases where It doesn't fit or fits with struggle, perhaps **dictfier** can help on those cases. I also welcome you to try it and give me some feedback.
These posts are very cool, good job :)

No because in English `seif` is... weird? You have to be careful when sticking words together, because they can easily change due to the fact that English uses multiple letters to encode single sounds. Just like you can't stick `e` at the end of `mat` to make `mat-e`. This is why we have rules to stuck words together with upper case letters or `_`'s. English doesn't work without spaces due to how the language words. Space is the most common character, so you wouldn't expect it any other way. Anyways, the purpose of the short words is to act as mnemotics for the human and that, `elif` does well enough, and it even sounds like a single word and looks like a single word, making it more readable. It's easier to read short words, if and when they can be short, a short word will be easier to spot then a larger one. This works because `elif` is a statment, and is global to the entire language. Being one of the most commonly written and read words in the entire language, it just makes sense that it'd be short.
Very impressed. How do you even make anything like the renderer in python? What is the way to output that is graphical on the screen?
Personally, I prefer Splash. Scripting is done in Lua, but other that oddity it just seems more newbie friendly to me.
Three months ago I switched employers. The old one was still standardized on 2.4. The current one is on 3.6. I feel like Captain America just thawed out. "Holy shit, guys! Did you know about f-strings?! Mind. Blown"

In an ideal world, you'd have a digital pregnancy test securely send results to you in some form that you can use requests, beautifulsoup or whatever module to read the data and do something with it, but I'm not sure how far medical technology has gone, let alone the ethics of transferring that data.
I've got many many opportunities from LinkedIn and Python Brasil group, you must check these out...
HAHA, you'll learn more; maybe land a Job if you want one doing this type of work.
Oh okay, thank you!
Not sure I can see a market for that... There already exists "digital" pregnancy tests in that they have an LCD screen that says "pregnant" or "not pregnant". From experience when my wife and I were trying the "digital" ones were not quite as reliable and did not work as early. The nice thing about current pregnancy tests is that they are quick, easy, reliable, and cheap. You just pee on a stick and 2 minutes later have a line or no line. If you add in finding a way to have the pregnancy test send you a message or create a web page for you you would need to either give that info directly to the test somehow, which would increase cost and complexity, or have the company making the tests send you a test that already has that data increasing cost. Either way you have to have a data connection of some sort which could easily fail. Finally, with a pregnancy test you just have to look at the test strip, add a message or a webpage into it and you have to get onto your computer, log into a web page, look at the result there. That work flow is much more difficult than looking at a strip. All these thing are possible and easy with current technology, but why? You take a simple chemical reaction on a plastic strip and add unneeded technology to it which makes it more expensive and more error prone for no real gain.

Yes, available in other languages and used a lot. When I first moved over to Python I was surprised and a little disappointed they weren't a thing. Lots of advantages. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37601644/python-whats-the-enum-type-good-for The alternatives you mention don't have all the advantages of enums. Generally enums help avoid bugs and reduce coding effort, so they're worth getting to know.
I’m 19 and nowhere near this... good job OP
I heard you can set charts to offline. Similarly to cufflinks, can you also output the chart as a figure without all that stuff at the top? &amp;#x200B; Like in cufflinks I go... &amp;#x200B; plot = df.iplot(asFigure = True) &amp;#x200B; Then set py.iplot(plot, config = {'showLink': False, 'displayModeBar':False))

I like the idea of showing him the code and asking him to check my work. That's fun!
We do. We're in the process of porting 100's of thousands of lines of `asyncore` code (Python 3.3) to `asyncio` (Python 3.5). Our company sent a whole team to PyCon, six of us, to see almost every presentation and report back.

If it makes you feel any better, I feel like an idiot every time I visit this sub.
I don't see any reason to roast you over it. It works, which is the most important part. You did some good things (especially checking the guess for non-letters). There are somethings that could be improved, but were understandably written the way they were due to lack of knowledge. One would be the `word_to_list` function. It's a lot more than it needs to be. In Python, you can iterate through a string. So, it can be refactored into... wordL = [] for l in word: wordL.append(l) return wordL There are several similar places where you use a counter and don't need to. And when you learn about list comprehension, you can shorten it to `wordL = [l for l in word]` and just put it in as line 87, doing away with the `word_to_list` function. Other things can be tightened up, but again, the program works, so they don't really need to be. What I would rather you look into is adding a function that calls out to an internet site that supplies random words.

I often overload `|` for piping functions
&gt; Question about my run function - it's essentially a loop that only ends when the user hits ctrl-C. Is there a way to unit test this? Off the top of my head, I don't think so (but don't quote me on that...) I don't think we talk about "unit testing" the main function that runs the entire application. That's more of an integration test, I think, and you will probably need some sort of framework to feed the application input data, collect and verify the output data, and inject a Ctrl-C to end the loop running. That last part might be too hard to do using automated testing.

I'm sorry that you've been burned like this. I assure you that's not the situation here - more so that we need Python generalists who aren't afraid of other programming languages and can design systems rather than implement frameworks.
Please don't put everything in the body of the code. Use if name main. That way you can use this as a module
Blinn-Phonh next I presume? :)
Yes, I made it. I used PIL for everything related to actually drawing polygons and pixels on the screen
Thank you
Depends on what your actual job is but as someone who's worked pretty extensively in warehousing you're likely SOL if you're doing inventory by hand. Depends what you're actual role is.
It really depends. There are a few factors: - Computer quality - Number of polygons in a mesh - The shading mode - The resolution - How big polygons are on the screen In the flat mode, actually rendering stuff is one of the fastest processes. What takes time is sorting the faces and calculating vertex normals. On Gouraud mode, rendering takes the longest. This is because every polygon is filled with a bunch of lines, and if it's really big on the screen, that will be a lot of lines to draw. On flat mode, they take around 2-10 seconds. On Gouraud, the time is usually between 5 seconds and 3 minutes
Thank you
Yeah same thing I'm doing. But running script every hour and fetching last two days data to get only last hours mails is getting tedious.
I'm really intrigued by what you've been able to accomplish. How would someone go about building their own renderer like you?
A year ago you probably had no idea how to do any of this. I'm absolutely CERTAIN if you wanted to, you could add this with ease, if you put your mind to it.
Thank you. I starred from the basic concepts, like the formula that calculates where a 3D point should be projected on the screen. Then, I used a formula for calculating surface normals, which is how I got backface culling. Everything after that was just adding more and more little features: shading based on a light source, vertex normals, diffuse color, gouraud shading, face sorting etc. I'm not in college yet, so my ways of doing these are probably not the best, or even correct, but as far as it's working... :)

This is the third post I've seen from you and I'm really enjoying the progress you're making, great job OP. Would love to make something like this and be this consistent with progress, gotta look at your repo sometime.
In phong shading you save the normal into a varying variable in the vertex shader. Then you do the lighting calculation inside the pixel shader, using the interpolated normal that you get by reading that same varying variable.
So it's like Gouraud shading but it's working in 3D
I'll one up this, enjoy getting any job you want. Fantastic work, this is amazing.
 Hey man, I went to your github and I loved the bee fact discord bot, as a student I'll study your code to learn a bit about those libraries and interesting lambda function. Thanks!
Might it be best to post in r/learnpython
Thanks for the information, are there any resources you can recommend that taught you what you needed to know?
Can I interest you in an efficient (iterative-algorithm) Fibonacci implementation that [doesn't use any integer literals or arithmetic operators](https://github.com/ubernostrum/interviewer-hell/blob/master/fibonacci/boolean.py)?
Thanks, I appreciate that!
Thanks for your help. Swagger and OpenAPI seem to be what I am looking for. Perhaps I was not using the right search terms since this library seems quite popular.
That’s really cool! I continue to be impressed. I’d love to read some posts (blog or otherwise) where you talk about things like the math behind things like different shading methods and challenges using pillow to do rendering.
Great work! You might be able to use something like Cython to improve performance even further!
&gt; I wish they would have spent more time making Pathlib compatible with all the stdlib. "They"? Python is open source. Where's your patch or PR?
&gt; Of all the string formatting methods available, the only one to fulfil that, is string modulus tuple. [Incorrect.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter)
&gt; Do you know what kind of string formatting is supported by it? Answer: % [Incorrect.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter)

&gt; NameError: name 'status' is not defined You've got to be shitting me. Are you are beginner with a week's experience in Python confused by NameError? If course you get a NameError exception if status isn't defined. I don't believe for one microsecond that you genuinely didn't understand u/chrisatlee 's intention and were confused by the NameError. christatlee the logging module already supports exactly what you want to do, although due to backwards-compatibility it is a little unwieldy (but no worse than using localization). https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter
So two months ago you couldn't write hello world?
It can also be helpful when you are normalizing data using a web api to cache the results. I had to normalize similar data and some fields I had to convert using a web api. Using memoization turned this task from multiple hours into a coffee break.

In the spirit of shoving PEPs through, whoever authored the proposition should have spent more effort integrating the new features into the established modules. Can't half ass stdlib contributions, the release cycle is too slow to fix them.

Post to /r/learnpython and include your code, preferably not in the form of a Google Drive link.
Short answer: Not really. Long answer: I had to figure out myself many of the things I did because I couldn't find anyone who could actually give practical advice (it seems people don't make renderers very often). The only thing I can recommend is reading about the core concepts (like how perspective works, rotation matrices, shading etc). Although I can't explain in a few words, I will consider making a blog about it in the future.
Of course you can, and oh you did
You can check at Eduonix portal there you will find free tutorials on learning python as beginner. Also, they have project-based tutorials where you can build projects and learn.
Thank you! I’ll try it for sure.
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [PEP526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/), and [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) are good for learning how to make your code a bit easier to look at and read later down the road. Most of the PEP's are good reads. This is also a good place to start: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide

This looks like rasterizing, correct? That stuff looks complicated. I wanted to explore 3D rendering, but rasterizing was so hard to wrap my head around. I think it’s all the matrix math... Ray tracing was much easier to wrap my head around, I’ve actually been working on one in Rust.
Yes, it's basically rasterizing. Ray tracing is harder than this because what I do here is just calculating the position of the vertex on the screen, no matrices are necessary. Ray tracing, on the other hand, means working with a lot of formulas and calculations and raycasts

What's the actual issue? It just looks like a way to change HTTP headers?

Very cool man congrats Are you using a graphics api (opengl, directx ...) or you're making your own rasterizer ?
No, there is no api here, it's my own rasterizer :)

Well, there are also a lot of crash courses on YouTube for beginners. Some of them are really good to be honest. You can also check some books like "Automate the boring stuff with python" or "Python crash course by Eric Mattes" which imo are both really good for beginners and lots of projects to practice your skills.
Good job OP. Try to learn an api next. I recommend using c++ for 3D programming. there are many resources out there especially opengl. Trust me your renders will run blazingly fast.
I know I could just use an API to replace these 500 lines of code with 10. If I only wanted to display something in 3D I would have definitely used a library, but I wanted to do it myself and understand how renderers work

would love to see it! Is it in python? I looked at the Code Bullet Github and there the files had .pde extensions and everything seemed so unfamiliar?

A more condensed version for reference: MAX_ATTEMPTS = 10 def get_guess(): while True: guess = input("Guess a letter: ") if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha(): return guess.capitalize() else: print("Guess must be a single letter!") def reveal_guess(view, word, guess): for i, letter in enumerate(word): if letter == guess: view[i] = letter if __name__ == "__main__": word = "ELEPHANT" view = ["_"] * len(word) for attempts_remaining in reversed(range(MAX_ATTEMPTS)): print(view) guess = get_guess() if guess not in word: print(f"Sorry, '{guess}' is not in the word!") print(f"You have {attempts_remaining} attempts remaining.\n") continue reveal_guess(view, word, guess) if "_" not in view: print("You won! :)") break else: print("You lost! :(") print(f"The word was: {word}")

No matter how secure it is, your server will still get hack if it's online or allow clients to connect to it. To make it truly secure, I suggest you make it offline or create a login system to only allow your account to login. Set the account to expire every 15 mins or so.
Digital Ocean, build a dockerfile for the app and deploy it that way
Thanks for the reply! I have already a login system and 2 factor authentification. The server must be online. A few people must be able to connect at any time. They sessions all expire after X mins. I still want to make the extrastep and whitelist the IP address of my server.
Since your client connection is a static IP, why not just whitelist the client's IP address instead of the dynamic address set by heroku? Wouldn't that make more sense? Client connects to DB, not the other way around.
&gt; Why is this such a problem for heroku, pyhtonanywhere to provide a static IP? It’s not that it’s a problem, it’s that it doesn’t fit the model of a PaaS provider, where they’re spinning up an on-demand VM when a request is made, rather than just having your app running 24/7. To provide you a static IP they’d need to have a dedicated load balancer that _would_ have to run continuously and be assigned solely to you... which is why you pay for it.
Mate, if you wrote a series of posts on this, future unis and jobs would go nuts over you (even more than now). Really great to see this stuff!

This is a perfect post for r/learnpython.
The add-on, which would give me a static IP and fit my needs would cost 100$/month\~. I could get a server for less, which would have a static IP, but the tradeoff using heroku or pythonanywhere is their service, their infrastructure and that setuping everything is easy, do I understand this correctly? Owning my own server will give me a static IP and will be cheaper, but I would be responsible for a lot of things, which are handled for free on heroku, correct?

And that links to: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#formatting-styles Which explains how it basically doesn't work, unless the entire application and all libraries have been audited to ensure that none use % strings in logging.
I have a webapp. Clients login into the webapp and my website sends the request. I could indeed make a software, but I make some pretty long calculations, which are way faster on the server. But still a great idea. If I create a software, the client would directly hit the DB, the client has a static device IP. The tradeoff would be, that the client machine needs to make all calculations, this could take some time.
You could use `string.upper()` to convert the word and guesses to uppercase, then you don't need the instruction to keep it uppercase.
