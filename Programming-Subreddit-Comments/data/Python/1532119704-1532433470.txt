yes, that's what i'd do. (and yes, hopefully it would help).

Awesome! Thank you for checking it out.
Not all things that you install from PyPi are simple python modules. Some require compilation of some source files, other require installing other python modules, etc, etc. 
Well, the core developers have almost the same level of experience as Guido since they came to python very early on. I wouldn't call them "hobbyist." I bet a lot of them are senior developers with extremely important roles in their companies.
Seems like odd behaviour... possibly a bug on reddit's new design. Maybe try the old reddit design (there is usually a link/button on the top to switch to old reddit... or google how to do that)

That about sums you up I guess.
Wait until you learn about haskell. 
3.4 is only getting security fixes starting now.
Yay! I wanted something to do whilst pretending to work!
Bro, don't pay for something, when you have like tons and tons of books on the internet for free.
I'd suggest `autohotkey` (google it) for this instead. If you need python, then `pyautogui`. But yes, this is a question for /r/learnpython. This subreddit is for news
Sorry, but Java is pretty easy too. (also piece of shit :D )
They can't even properly explain what it is. 
Do you mean when debugging ? Had the same issue, Tried again recently and switch project config from "Debug" to "Release" - much better! I still have issues with VS stopping when throwing exceptions (even if they are catched) :(

The behavior will generally be the same, at least not accounting for bugs. The actual implementation will differ slightly to account for the differences in the syntax and the API.

Yeah, I should have made it clear: the Java wasn't bad, it was the crapy compilers they made us use. I'd get a project done and coded in an hour or so, and then fight the compiler for another four or five. The IDEs back then were awful. Another treat: our tests were HAND WRITTEN. On paper. So, prof would say: write a class that does x or functions that do y,z and you'd have to sit there with a bunch of paper and write them out by hand. If you forgot a line, you had to erase everything under it and re-write it all. If you had some multi-line if-else tree, there was no copy-paste for print statements or whatever. The whole thing was insane. Anyway, huge turnoff. I don't think universities appreciate how lost freshman get and how much they could really benefit from guidance and encouragement from upperclassmen. 
I've used Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm in the past for Python development, and I've used Visual Studio extensively for development with C++. I like Visual Studio. Its a nice IDE. But I don't use it (I use VS Code). Why you might ask? Its darn slow. That being said it seems you are okay with it. The only other main issue I have with it is that the documentation is a bit wanting, but that may also not be an issue for you. I will say it has no competition with debugging native extensions (at least that I've found), I absolutely love mixed mode debugging, though of course that is rather niche.

Yeah I hate how patriarchy/sexism shaped how the genders consider themselves and others. Did you know originally computer science work was considered a female profession? I digress. Never think you are not capable. Rather, remember we're all confused all the time. If you aren't confused, you probably need to expand your comfort zone and work on a new type of project! Design is hard, but remember almost all the problems have already been solved by others. Need to manipulate data? There's pandas. Need to build some data base models? Django, SQL Alchemy, etc. What's challenging is trying to come up with the best implementation of all the various pieces. The work is less about knowing the answer and more about having an inquisitive mind and the desire to do the research. Lastly, I think diverse teams intrinsically make better products. It's impossible for white dudes to make the perfect products for women, minorities, etc. We need more diversity in the work!
Somewhat unrelated &gt; int('1_0') is 10 in py3, but invalid in py2. This even bit us before we switched to py3 because the mismatch caused another team that used py3 before us to send us integer literals that we thought were invalid, but they thought were valid. I personally think this decision was a mistake: very strict parsing is a better default. I fear this will continue to bite us in subtle ways for years to come. I feel like Raymond Hettinger used something like this as a point to the surprise at what previously invalid syntax is now valid. And personally I agree with him. I can see various cases where a user expects the output on the server to be a string, but the server by default treats all inputs as potential numbers first so they go the try/except route.

Was that guy working on something Py2 only? Even then. While I personally disagree, there are people that choose Py2 only because it is more mature.
This would cause more issues than solutions for the large majority of people.
No I’m not there yet. I’m still very early in my understanding of python. Besides I haven’t had a need for it. I’ve been focusing more on practical uses for python so that way it keeps me engaged. 
Thanks, Mr. Waffles! I will forge on! 
Ok, Thanks. How much time were you dedicating after/before work to learing python/full stack?
An interesting concept! I often find myself designing re-usable and robust exception-handling logic in my applications so anything that makes that easier is definitely interesting. Having read through the readme and taken a (quick) peak at your (early, I know) code, I have a couple of questions to make sure I’m understanding the assumptions correctly: From what I can see, it seems that Exceptive works by inheriting special exception-handling-methods from a parent class defined in your library. These exception-handlers are called when the object’s “run” method raises an exception. Is my understanding correct? If so, what about methods other than “run” that might raise exceptions? Or functions (or statements/function calls) that might raise exceptions? If I’m interpreting your design assumption correctly, then I think it’ll be a little limited. For one thing, it forces me to inherit from your Exceptive classes, which in turn mandates a particular API design (for example, I might not want to funnel my class’ logic through a “run” method, or I might need to handle exceptions in other methods). One alternative you might want to consider is a decorator pattern. One idea might be for Exceptive to provide decorators that act as “switchboards” (basically wrapping the underlying function or method in a try...except block and calling a registered handler function based on the exception raised). That basically allows users of your library to maintain their own class/API design and employ Exceptive more widely. On a related note, you mention thinking about extending Exceptive for backoff/retry strategies. There’s a library I released a few months ago called [Backoff-Utils](https://github.com/insightindustry/backoff-utils) which implements various backoff/retry strategies using both a function/wrapper-based syntax *and* a decorator pattern. Feel free to take a look at its code in case it helps inspire you! Hope this helps, and best of luck, Chris
Are you me? Have I started commenting in an alt account on reddit when I'm on ambien? 
750 man hours is a lot of learning time, thats more than you spend in a University semester with a full course load, let alone for a single subject (~35 hrs/week * 4 months = 560 hrs). You could easily become very proficient in Python if you start from the basics.
Wow, thank you! Can't wait to see what pops out of this project.
Depending on the versions you support, but yes. My project supports 2.7.7+ and 3.4-3.7. It's really not that hard; you just can't use the fancy new features.
What's the advantage of using this over something like marshmallow or colander? 
When I started coding as a freelancer I thought it was about impressing clients with my skills and knowledge. So I'd either struggle to turn prospects into clients or they would lead me on. They would act impressed and then cheat me out of my money. Often, they'd get information out of me, even a proposal. Then they'd find somebody else to do the job - for less money. But, when I applied what I learnt in sales and marketing I started getting waay better money.
TLDR: simpler with comparably rich (and in some cases richer) functionality **Architectural simplicity.** Both Marshmallow and Colander are great, but when combined with SQLAlchemy they force you to maintain two separate (but related) representations of your data model: one is the SQLAlchemy model definition, and the other is the schema definition made using either Marshmallow or Colander that maps to your SQLAlchemy model class. In practice, I find that it is easier (read: less effort) to maintain a SQLAlchemy model that is enriched with complex serialization/deserialization support, rather than maintaining both the SQLAlchemy model and a semi-independent (but related) schema definition. Basically, one class to maintain rather than two. **Ease-of-use** While Marshmallow and Colander are both (relatively) straightforward, they require a much more verbose syntax to configure how you want objects to serialize/deserialize. **SQLAthanor** uses a minimalistic API that piggybacks on SQLAlchemy’s existing ORM, minimizing the amount of code and simplifying the complexity of the code you need to write for comparable results. **Richer format support** In the wild, I’ve often had to develop APIs that needed support for inbound/outbound data in various formats (JSON and CSV being the most common). IIRC, Marshmallow supports JSON only, and while it can be hacked to support CSV or YAML, I seem to recall it being a non-trivial task. Colander, from what I recall, is limited to Python serializing/deserializing to/from Python primitives which - while super important - still leaves the “last mile” (de/serialization from/to JSON, CSV, YAML, etc) to get past, which can be non-trivial. — Where Marshmallow and Colander definitely beat **SQLAthanor** is if you’re looking to serialize/deserialize objects that are *not* SQLAlchemy models. Simply put, that is outside of the scope of **SQLAthanor**, since it is explicitly designed as an add-on to SQLAlchemy. Marshmallow and Colander are both designed to work with any kind of Python object via their schema interfaces/mappings, whether they are SQLAlchemy models or not. — Hope this helps answer your question! Of course, everything I’ve listed above is based on my (imperfect) knowledge of both Marshmallow and Colander, but the above reasoning is really some of the main factors that drove me to develop **SQLAthanor** in the first place. All the best, Chris
It looks like win32gui is [a third party library](https://pypi.org/project/win32gui/). Install it with pip and be on your merry way :) If you aren't familiar with libraries or pip, head to r/learnpython. 
[http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32\_how\_do\_i.html](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i.html) will answer a lot of the questions you have pertaining to PyWin32 on Windows (10 included). For questions on how to code in Python, I suggest going to r/learnpython. 
You'll get more and better responses if you post on r/learnpython. I haven't played with pyautogui but since it seems you want to automate things, I'd suggest reading [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (it's also a book), it covers pyautogui and capturing key-presses with it. Happy coding\~! 
Thanks 😁😁
I've only had a quick look at the documentation. Was uncertain how this would work for reflected models.
Numpy is especially stable by Python standards, and Python libraries tend to be stable in general (much more so than JS). Numpy does call into the C bindings quite a bit (which had numerous changes from Python 2 to 3), so the chance of bugs is higher than a pure Python library. However, it's a dependency for a bunch of other libraries, so it's very very well tested. So in short it should be the same. When in doubt run your unit test suite with both versions. 
Yes you can, but I would recommend against it (unless you have a good reason), because as Brian pointed out you lose the C interop, which is a huge benefit of Python IMO. 
Released version 2.2 Adds several new features including an Image Element and a 1-line debug print. If you would like to be doing more with a GUI and have a lot of prints in your code that you rely on, then maybe the new 1-line debug print will help. The way it works is you call a function that looks just like a print function except that the output will go to a window. If the window doesn't exist, the first print will open it up. It's a scrollable window that you can use your mouse and keyboard to copy text from. The print function optional parameters `end` and `sep` both work as you would expect. If you want to try this debug printing out, but don't want to change your code, no problem! This is Python and redefining print is a 1-line change. Put this at the top of your file, after the import, and your print statements will output to a window. print = SG.Print Here's is a screenshot that matches the code below. [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43031072-5e31fd3e-8c68-11e8-8385-e4d5bbc4b948.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43031072-5e31fd3e-8c68-11e8-8385-e4d5bbc4b948.jpg) import PySimpleGUI as g g.Print('Trying out the print cability') print=g.Print print('This really does work') for i in range(100): print(i) Python is so much for to play with! You can either manually call g.Print, or redefine print as you can see in the example.
Thanks for the question! I actually haven’t (yet) looked into support for reflected models, either using the automap extension or reflected database objects more generally (relying on Table autoload=True). Support for reflected models is *definitely* worth adding into SQLAthanor, and it’s going on the roadmap for the next version: * Basically, automap support is “almost done” already: I’ll just need to look into overriding the AutomapBase class to leverage the SQLAthanor base model to expose the serialization methods. * More general Table reflection might be a little more complicated, but should also be doable. Thanks again for the suggestion, and look for v.0.2.0 soon! All the best, Chris
Cool. Looking forward to v0.2.0 then. I like the look of this library, so want to try it out.
I'll give you the simplicity of not managing two representations. I recently made a library that creates marshmallow schemas from annotations (though it still needs a lot of work), and I'm thinking of how to auto generate mappings from tools like attrs (annotations alone aren't powerful enough, I think). So hopefully this stops being an issue in the future as we develop better tooling. As for non-json formats, providing a different raw deserialization handler to marshmallow is fairly trivial just non-obvious: the json module argument (at its called that in the 2.x line) accepts any object that has load and dump methods on it so its easily extendable to any format, even adhoc ones. Though I typically find it easier to handle transport level serialization separately from object level serialization - e. g. use the csv module to handle csv data for me, and then marshmallow to handle transforming that data and then reverse the flow if needed. 
Oh, one slight correction (with good news!): I just took a closer look at [reflection in the declarative ORM](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/declarative/table_config.html#using-reflection-with-declarative), and while I haven’t done any tests it *should* already work. Basically, so long as your model inherits from SQLAthanor’s base, it *should* just naturally reflect the contents of __table__. You can then configure serialization/deserialization using either the Meta approach, or override Column attributes using the Declarative approach described in the docs. This doesn’t do anything for automap, though. Like I said, I haven’t tested this at all, so it’s all theoretical. With a little luck, I can write some unit tests and update the docs with examples soon. All the best, Chris
the code feels very java-like with its naming and such, there are many cases where you could use @property isntead if a getter function: @property def inventory(self): # you will need to rename the class attribute "inventory" to be like # "_inventory" for this to work, cause of names clashing return [item for item in self._inventory] instead of def getInventory(self): inventoryList = [] for item in self.inventory: inventoryList.append(item) return inventoryList class names should be PascalCased: class Inventory: ... instead of class inventory: ... variables and function names should be snake\_case: def add_item(self, item): self.inventory.append(item) def remove_item(self, item): self.inventory.remove(item) lamp_interactions = ['take', 'break', 'punch', 'kick', 'drop', 'pick up'] there are many cases where you can use list comprehensions, and many others where you are uses a index loop when it could jsut be a value loop: for x in y: ... in summary, your code style seems very Java-Like and does not feel very python-like, [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) is a good resource for naming convention and such also there is a really good video about making more pythonic code on [youtube by Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)

I can't reproduce your issue since I have neither Windows nor IDLE, but I noticed that your file's name has a whitespace in it. Although this may be common practice under Windows, this should generally be avoided by programmers because it often makes string parsing a lot more complicated than necessary. I wouldn't be too surprised if that was the reason for your crash, actually.
Thanks - Good to know non-JSON formats are doable, even if non-obvious. And I like your idea of auto-generating Marshmallow schemas based on annotations/attrs. Definitely an interesting approach. Is the library you’ve built for it open source? If so, what’s it called / where can I find it? I’d love to take a look! All the best, Chris
for me: always miniconda

it looks nasty, dont like it

Thank you so much for all of this feedback. I will look over and study it. I am glad you enjoyed the game!
I've always had the ambition to make games. I started learning python 5 months ago and I'm slowly and surely making progress.
[marshmallow-annotations](https://github.com/justanr/marshmallow-annotations) Like I said, still pretty rough around the edges but it's been pretty useful the handful of places that I've used it.
It is doing exactly what you are telling it to. You are creating a window, setting the color and title, then making the **console** wait for keyboard input. This is a single threaded application and the `input` call is blocking, which means nothing else can happen until the console receives keyboard input. Windows takes this lack of responsiveness as meaning the application has stalled so notifies you that the window is unresponsive. You probably want the window itself to be receiving keyboard input so things can happen in the window based on the keys being pressed. For this purpose, `input` isn't what you want, there is probably some Turtle-specific way of capturing keyboard input in a non-blocking (asynchronous) fashion but I don't know much about that library. From a quick google this SO post shows how to do it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15985288/python-turtle-graphics-keyboard-commands It seems you have to create functions to respond to individual keypresses, tell Turtle to call those functions on those keypresses, and then call `turtle.listen()` which is where Turtle takes over and dispatches keypress actions to the functions you told it about. Here's an example I've adapted from the SO code: import turtle window = turtle.Screen() myTurtle = turtle.Turtle() def up(): myTurtle.sety(myTurtle.ycor() + 10) def down(): myTurtle.sety(myTurtle.ycor() - 10) def left(): myTurtle.forward(-10) def right(): myTurtle.forward(10) window.onkey(up, "Up") window.onkey(down, "Down") window.onkey(right, "Right") window.onkey(left, "Left") window.listen() window.exitonclick()

Because you are asking the interpreter to tell you what variable type each example is. If you just want it to print the value, it's simply: print(a)
Type is just a built in python function that tells you the type of the variable that it was assigned implicitly. This is really helpful in cases where type is important. Like for example, you need to iterate over a list or a dictionary that is passed into a function as an argument, but an end user might accidentally pass in an integer which will cause a runtime error - you could handle that ahead of time by checking the type of the argument passed in and reporting feedback to the user accordingly. 
I don't know the answer to your problem but in all future questions about programming languages, post your code and post all of your code, preferably in text format not a screenshot. Learn how to format code in reddit so it doesn't come out in a jumble of text. Just in general make it as easy as possible for others to help you- don't assume you know what the problem is or what the solution might look like because by definition as a beginner you are likely to be wrong in your assumptions. Your English is good :)
Thank you for the advice, I will definitely keep it in mind next time.
Thanks for the detailed reply, this is very helpful! I think for this project I will stick with a text file implementation as you suggested. Looking forward though, do you have any pointers on how to familiarize myself better with db management systems? Specifically, what the various main options are w/ their strengths and weaknesses? It will probably be useful in the future and something I'm interested in in general anyways. 
If you want to post all your code here, we can take a look at what you're doing. As a simple automation solution, I have found AutoHotKey on Windows to be very useful. If your intention is to learn python then continue on with pyautogui as it is much more powerful than AHK.
Ok sweet I will look into this. What type of project are you working on if you don't mind me asking?
I actually have no intention of learning Python (at least not yet) I am just doing a little project with my Arduino and believe it or not pyautogui was the easiest way to do it.
Why is the robot such a pussy when I tell it to go outside and fight the monster?

I'm working on a small text-game myself. I enjoyed playing your game immensely. I'm currently thinking about using PyQt as my GUI, was there a design decision that led you to using Tkinter, or was it just the first thing you came across?
Communication via REST API over HTTPS. Depending on what it is about, you could also encrypt the information “at rest”, i.e. encrypt it on the agent. Then the server would typically only store it, but couldn’t see the actual information (think tools like password managers for example)
Cool, sounds like fun! Post your code if you want help here, otherwise /r/learnpython.
So tell me more about what you learned and applied for the sales and marketing if you're willing. 
I went to an programming course at my school and bought a Python Book. 
Very seriously. Firstly &gt; Last commit by about 1 year ago Secondly in the educational and corporate space, Py2 is still *very* prevalent, and will continue to be beyond the EOS/EOL date.
Besides the fact that expression order isn't preserved by input and instead ordered by some default settings or a custom sort key, `sympy` is far better than this.
This is an unhelpful comment, but another place to ask this question would be r/learnpython
I'm using John M. Zelle's Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science
Why contribute to the prevalence of something that will shortly no longer be supported?
you might want to consider making the list all lowercase- in your example you'll see both Red Sox Vs Tigers and Red Sox vs Tigers appear
This is very cool and will open a lot more doors for development of an already very cool application.
&gt; now that Py2 has been EOL'ed. Sir, sir! We've caught a troll!
You can start to learn with youtube tutorials or with the python guide in python.org
This is the wrong sub for this /r/learnpython would be better. However, you do not want to cd to your site-packages directory before cloning. In fact you should really never be directly messing with that directory. It's possible that cloning there is offing up your namespace so that the package itself is not being imported correctly. Without knowing more I can't be exactly sure of your problem but try completely deleting the directory created by your git clone and see if that fixes your issue.
I think annotations will definitely be a better design choice when it comes to provide flexibility to developers and I will definitely have a look into [Backoff-Utils](https://github.com/insightindustry/backoff-utils) as well. :)
Personally, I like sololearn. They have a mobile app so you can learn on the go. Then either download python or use repl.it
Codecademy, exercise.io, codewars for practice. I learned with the Learning Python, 5th edition by Mark Lutz and a lot of practice. 
Creative/cool idea with simple code. Thumbs up from me :). Keep it up. 
I just get a blank txt file. It does run withou errors and print total keywords found though
Besides learning the basics from tutorials and guides, the best thing you can do IMO is to think of a project. Make an application that automates something you already do. For example, I'm an anime enthusiast, so to learn Python I started building a Discord chatbot that keeps track of when new anime episodes release. It's significantly easier to stay motivated when you're making something you actually want. Of course, knowing which questions to ask is difficult when you don't know what's actually available in the language. Make liberal use of Google, Reddit and Stack Overflow. If you think you want more formal education, look around at local or web-based colleges or universities for computer science or programming courses. Obviously, that's going the extra mile and you'll have to judge if you want to take that kind of time and money to achieve your goals.
Yo! Good job, that's a really good idea. I think you could even go commercial with that one
Cleverprogrammer.com had really good fundamentals, check him out. It's free

Is there some differences with the Pandas library with its sql module and to_* from_* functions ? 
How is data from the sensor set being transferred to the computer? Are you able to get a dump the sensor data to the terminal on the server/computer/controller/monitor? What is the rate of data transfer, and how long do you need to retain the data? Can you save the data in batches that way you aren't saving one sample to a file 25 times a second or more. Handling the display isn't really my domain, but I'm betting you're thinking of a webapp that has a live updating plot in it. I'd recommend you take a look at live weather stations on the raspberry pi, since that kind of system will have a lot of similarity to your project. Another common project that shares your project design is almost anything involving an accelerometer, including but not limited to ball balancing robots. Almost everyone who plays with them also loads the data into some form of visualization, and between code from those and weather stations, you might have enough to work with for your prototyping. If this is for a commercial venture, something to be mindful of later on is data security. It's not something you should really design exclusively around during a prototyping phase, but if you think of security in the early design phases, it'll save you a lot of headache before going into production, or worse, after a data leak. This isn't as helpful as I'd like to be, but hopefully this gives you something to google and project ideas similar to yours that you can look at to build your prototype off of. Best of luck!
Data Camp has some good videos
Remember that there are several google trends datasets at [their github.](https://github.com/GoogleTrends/data)
I’d personally start with going through one of the Python career tracks in Datacamp. They start off with introductory courses and gradually ramp up. Once you’ve got a few courses in the Data Science track under your belt look into using the skills on a Kaggle dataset. For example the titanic dataset has a lot of sample code which you can refer to when writing your own. Its at this point I’d look into starting your own project. All the while continue gradually working through the 20 odd courses on the Datacamp career track
This is true. You'll need to then install all the dependencies (python or native) which gets harder and harder as you might need exact versions, etc. 
Good call
Listen, as much of an evangelist of Py3 I am, I concede to the fact that Py2 will never die.

Look at Django + django rest framework. Chooise your poison for the frontend, but a webapp is probably a good bet using something like React, but django has a pretty powerful templating language. Is per second updates a must? You might need to move to websockets.
Why not use a set instead of having to loop through the list to remove duplicates? 
No, I'm quite serious. I do a lot of command-line programming and Py3 just isn't a good fit. The core devs freely acknowledge that this is something they knowingly threw under the bus to make Py3 better for, say, web applications, which is something I rarely write. Py3 still hadn't resolved issues it had (that matter to me and which Py2 doesn't suffer from) by the time they EOL'ed Py2, so I went looking elsewhere. I didn't give up my weapon of choice of ~15 years lightly, and I don't appreciate being called a troll for doing so. Just because you may think that Python 3 is the best thing since sliced bread, doesn't mean everyone else does, too.
I would recommend looking in to MQTT for the data transfer, it is a queue-based protocol where you can setup a broker on your server, and have your device publish data to that broker. You can then design a web-app that subscribes to the queue and displays data. There are Python libraries for publishing and subscribing to MQTT queues, such as Paho.
I would like the server to be able push some data (configuration information) to agent. And agent uses that configuration to run some operation and then push some small txt files to the server. Is that possible way that REST api?
I think the best way to learn is by building things. Automatetheboringstuff is amazing and well worth doing. You can get the text free on Al's site, or buy the video course on Udemy. The video course is absolutely worth it. 
This is probably cool and all but there's so much to improve. 1. You've hard coded file paths on your machine. 2. There's no need to write xml to file, just deal with the xml bytes in memory. 3. The requests library is standard now instead of using urllib it's well worth learning. 4. Deduplication would be easier as set() 5. Is oldList simply a copy of old? You should learn list comprehensions anyway. 6. Use with open as instead of .open and .close 7. Use writeline instead of joining with "/n" 
cool!!!!
this has exactly 666 upvotes now and I wonder if this is a coincidence or a conspiracy
probably both tbh
Lol. It is pretty cowardly
I looked up how to create GUIs in Python and PyQt and Tkinter seemed to be pretty popular. I first looked into PyQt because critics seemed to prefer it, but I read you need to pay for a license even if it isn't a commercial game. Tkinter is free, so that was the main motivating force lol. I had trouble finding strong documentation, and had to rely on stack overflow answers to figure out how to implement it. 
Mind sharing your thoughts about the project?

Hi __crackers__, I’m a not-beginner (~1 year experience), self-taught Python programmer who only makes command line programs so far. Since I started in 2017, I started with Python 3. What issues do you see with command line programming in Python 3? Anything I should be aware of or concerned about as a part-time semi-hobbyist programmer?
Great question! TLDR: much greater and easier flexibility / adaptability to complex business logic. If you’re working on a project that doesn’t apply a lot of business logic to your data, or whose data doesn’t involve many complex relationships between tables, then pandas is great. (I find this is often the case in data science projects). If your project has complex data relationships or complicated business logic around your data, then the SQLAlchemy ORM combined with SQLAthanor is probably the better choice. Here’s a much more in-depth explanation as to why: **Architectural Differences** First, pandas works directly over a database connection to read the contents of a given table/SQL query into its DataFrame as-is. It does *not* work with the [SQLAlchemy ORM](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html) which provides highly extensible object representation for database tables and records. As a result, pandas can operate like a sort-of-ORM on a “flat” (no relationships) set of extracted data. It lets you mutate and manipulate data once it has been extracted from your database, but it is not quite a full-featured ORM since it doesn’t allow you to model relationships, or build extensive business logic into your DataFrame. If your application needs to apply further logic on top of your data, you would generally mutate your data frame using Python code that operates outside of the context of your DataFrame instance (i.e. you mutate the data as needed, then operate on the mutated data). The round-trip usage pattern is (to grossly oversimplify): 1. Extract data from a SQL query into a pandas.DataFrame. 2. Mutate / manipulate data in the DataFrame to suit business logic. (Often adding new columns derived from the table’s original columns, for example). 3. Serialize as necessary. 4. De-serialize into a pandas.DataFrame. 5. Mutate / manipulate data in the DataFrame to create the desired SQL structure (often removing columns or changing data types to maintain database/table compatibility). 6. Persist the DataFrame to the database. SQLAthanor, by contrast, works with the SQLAlchemy ORM, which *is* a full-featured ORM. SQLAlchemy provides a higher level of abstraction for interfacing with your underlying database, which allows you to do different things (model relationships, extend Python object representations with business logic, etc). This means that you can build business logic into the definition of your data’s Python representation, without mutating or operating on extracted data. This has *huge* implications for downstream maintenance. The basic usage pattern is: 1. Model a concept stored in a database, including relationships and business logic. 2. Extract instances of the model (records) from the database. 3. Change model properties (which automatically flows through the abstracted business logic) as needed. 4. Serialize as necessary. 5. De-serialize as necessary into a model object representation. 6. Persist the model’s representation (including relationships) to the database. There is a huge conceptual difference between the two. When using pandas you are effectively directly mutating the structure and contents of a flat table stored in memory. When using an ORM like SQLAlchemy you are instead mutating *properties* of an instance, which SQLAlchemy *maps* to an underlying table. This happens at a higher level of abstraction, which can simplify a *lot* of your code (read: you don’t have to care as much about the structure of your database table, because the ORM “handles that” for you). This is a **major** architectural difference between the two. Since SQLAthanor extends the SQLAlchemy ORM, it builds on and extends the abstraction capabilities that the SQLAlchemy ORM provides. **Enabling/Disabling Serialization/Deserialization at Column-level** The second major difference is closely related to the first. Because pandas serialization/deserialization operates directly on the data (either in the DataFrame or the serialized form, respectively), it basically operates on the data as-is. If there is a given column in your DataFrame, pandas will try to serialize it (or de-serialize if it is in your JSON or CSV) unless you explicitly tell it not to *at serialization time*. That runs into a frequent business challenge, because there are often times when you don’t want to serialize all of your database columns. For example, let’s say your “users” table contains a user’s hashed/encrypted password. Obviously, for security purposes you probably don’t want that serialized to CSV or JSON. With pandas, if the “password” column is in your DataFrame, it *will* be serialized unless you explicitly tell DataFrame.to_csv() which columns to serialize. That’s a verbose function call, and harder to maintain as your data structures evolve. To simplify maintenance, you would have to remove the column from the DataFrame prior to each serialization - which itself increases the maintenance burden. With SQLAthanor, you can just configure your serialization logic to basically say “never include the password column in serialized output” *without* mutating your model (DataFrame-analog) *or* explicitly doing so when serializing. Makes maintenance *much* easier. Similarly, you can configure SQLAthanor to ignore a read-only column if it’s present in your CSV/JSON/YAML when de-serializing. This simplifies a *lot* of logic, since you can just define that configuration simply in one place rather than implementing custom code to do it. **Pre/Post-processing** Because pandas serialization/deserialization operates on the data as-is, if you need to apply logic to a given column value either before serialization or after deserialization, you need to do it in your code. This is often used for data validation, type coercion, or encryption when deserializing, or type coercion when serializing. This means you need to either mutate your DataFrame and *then* serialize, or deserialize and *then* mutate a given column, or provide type coercion in your function call. This can lead to a lot of code or code complexity and significantly increases your downstream maintenance burden. SQLAthanor allows you to configure serialization/deserialization with property-level pre/post-processing logic that automatically runs when serializing/deserializing. Saves a lot of effort. **In Conclusion** I love pandas, and use it in a *lot* of the data science work I do. But by design, it operates on data “closer to bare metal” (at a lower level of abstraction) than the SQLAlchemy ORM. This is useful for computation-intensive operations, but requires more code/complexity for business-logic dependent operations. The SQLAlchemy ORM operates at a higher-level of abstraction, which simplifies the application of business logic to data in your code. SQLAthanor similarly operates at the level of abstraction provided by the SQLAlchemy ORM, and in turn simplified the challenge of maintaining good business logic when serializing/deserializing your data. Hope this helps! Chris

Like others have said, if you do a lot of development in C/C++ and use VS it makes sense to use it for python as well. I personally use VS for python and I really like it. Sometimes I think people avoid VS because they want to "stick it" to Microsoft, especially the open source python community.

Internally there will be differences as the C-API for Python 3 is somewhat different in many places. However these generally don't manifest themselves at the Python interpreter-level. The main difference for NumPy (and most other libraries) is `str` versus `bytes` versus `unicode`. So in NumPy the `string` datatype maps to `str` in Py2 and `bytes` in Py3, and `unicode` maps to `unicode` in Py2 and `str` in Py3. Also integer division is likely different.
OK, so tell me, what's your biggest unanswered question about sales/marketing?

As a beginner I would say, Django is pain in the ass. I was told, Flask is easier for beginners.
`str` in Py2 is ascii-encoded, so 1-byte per char. `str` in Py3 is UTF-8, so 1 to 4-bytes per char. There were some version of Py2 with UTF-16 `unicode`, I believe, but they are quite rare now. Basically, going from Py2 -&gt; 3, `unicode` became `str` and `str` became `bytes`. One uses the class methods `.encode()` and `.decode()` to convert from one to the other. This caused people who had written network tools that didn't have an explicit separation between bytes and strings a lot of trouble, and was responsible for much gnashing of teeth.

Your best bet is to install it on a remote server (depending on your requirements, a nano-Linode might do just fine), and access it via your browser. If you go down that path, [instructions and a Linode stackscript are here](http://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/jupyterhub-linode-stackscript/).

I couldn't tell if you were insane or just plain high. So I tried playing with this concept and so far I am bordering on insanely high. My first complaint is the absolute madness of scrambling your operational code in order to change the text of your traceback. This just can't be right. However, even though I'm having trouble inventing a reason to want to do this, I wondered what alternatives I'd explore other than the compile() mechanism you chose. I wouldn't do this but I'd probably even be in favor of using PyTraceBack\_Here in the ctypes api. But I think for 99.999999999 % of cases, I would just create a Traceback duck type class. You do have access to traceback and inspect so why not use them?

This has been posted to this sub at least 3 times in the past week. Wtf is going on here.
&gt; What issues do you see with command line programming in Python 3? Two things: 1. The POSIX spec is bytes. That means that `grep`, `find` and all that jazz expect input in bytes and output bytes. Filenames on UNIX filesystems are also bytes (with the exception of HFS+). Python 2 is a *great* fit for working with these programs because it shares the same text model and Just Works. In many cases, you can get Python 3 to work (but in others it never will), but you have to fight the language to do it. 2. Python 3's behaviour is very sensitive to the environment. A program that runs fine in your shell will often die in flames when run from `cron`, `launchd` etc. because they have empty environments. Effectively, it shifts encoding from something the developer has to worry about to something the user has to worry about. I think that's a terrible trade-off. &gt; Anything I should be aware of or concerned about as a part-time semi-hobbyist programmer? No. You *may* run into an unsolvable issue at some point, but mostly it should Just Work (at least, it should when 3.7 *finally* fixes the `cron` issue by defaulting to UTF-8 instead of ASCII. Only took ten fucking years…) Text encoding is a pain in Py2, and mostly Just Works in Py3. The thing is that I've been using Py2 for ~15 years and I know its text encoding inside out. So for me, using Py3 means using a text model I'm not as familiar with, but which I know absolutely cannot handle some issues I've run into over the years (albeit infrequently) because it's based on the broken assumption that all text can be decoded and doesn't give you the tools to easily undo its decoding "magic" when that broken assumption is violated. 
I'll just leave my copypasta rant here --- Well, this is really a big topic of debate. I'll give my personal opinion at the end of all the context, which I warn you, will be large. Python 3 is objectively lower on startup times (however rumor has it 3.8 will bring us to Py2.7 startup speeds, negating that argument). So if the product spends more action starting up than executing, like mercurial, you get fucked. Of course if it's not the case, except for a few super niche benchmarks, Py3 is always faster. There's also the theory of what is taught at educational institutions. Anybody who isn't a computer science major will probably be taught Py2-- they just don't need to upgrade and every algorthm can be written in Py2 as they can in Py3. Even in CS majors, many times they don't care to update. When I visted my college recently, I noticed the CS labs were running Ubuntu 12, Python 2.6/7 depending on the machine set, and the Java course was taught using Java 7, but they switched to Java 8 a week or so in. Java 10 is the current release, Java 11 will be the current release in September, 12 will come ~6 months later. Many companies using Java stay on Java 5-7, you'll be lucky if using 6+. Some companies also have to use tools like Webpack to make ES6+ JS turn into ES3 JS. *ES3*. Not ES5. I mean, if not ES3 than it would be ES5 which is the majority. The same goes for Python-- take a look at the site you are on. It was originally written in Py2.6 or earlier, evidenced by conditional code redefining some stdlib functions if not found, which were introduced in 2.7. *New* site services are being written in Py3, and when things need to be majorly refactored, they take out that service from r2 (main reddit app) and rewrite into Py3. But thats really on a "do on mini doomaday" scenario. Going back to the education thing-- lots of libraries are Py2 only. The ones public on PyPI alone are over 500. And that's the ones that are clearly labeled as Py2 only, not the ones not labeled at all. And that's on PyPI alone, there are plenty of other distribution networks as well. These are libraries that just work and their maintenance has stopped, or they depend on something of that nature. No need to change the tires when they have at least another couple thousand miles in them. This is more common in education than in business, but it exists in both worlds. In business, it gets worse-- because many times Python is used as glue. Glue to stick together a variety of things, whether it be build scripts, web servers, data pipelines, and more. Glue is generally a one time apply kind of thing. You don't use a fancy new glue unless you need to change something about the things being glued together. Because the glue just-- well, it fucking just works, and lasts a long, long time. It would cost more to update your glue than to just add a little more here and there when the edges start peeling. And then when you start glueing a new thing, you find that the fancy glue and the older glue don't mix well, so you use the older glue. Because it works. I'll give you two egrigous example-- React needs Py2 to build. Grumpy only works with Py2. As do many of the millions of lines of Python code at Google. Why? Because it will always cost more to upgrade. The points against this are as follows: * zero day attack * lack of new features * internal C bugs And the strong rebuttals are as follows: * either sand/black box or company takes the responsibility to patch the VM * company or third party patches the VM. A Py2 port called Tauthon already has a lot of Py3 syntax ported to Py2 * Py2 is more mature than Py3, if anything, time has shown Py3 has more of these rare bugs and segfaults than Py2. And again, company can patch it. The patch it thing goes back to the glue/screwdriver analogies-- why use a new version, on all of crafts, when you can make a minor change to your old version or not at all and it works? And this all started because of Py3 and how it was handled. Py2 had great backward compatibility and greater forward compatibility. Py3.0 threw this not out the window, but into the sun. The unicode debacle was horrible. 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, are widely regarded as Py3.0 beta, and Py3.4 being the actual Py3.0. And even then the debacle remains. Even worse, they have great backwards compatibility for 3.4-3.7 (maybe even 3.8, god willing), but horrible for forward compatibility through it, which has really given library maintainers a piece of hard as rock shit in a box and telling them to shove it back up their ass. I can elaborate on this if you'd like me to, but I won't here because it is mostly irrelevant. The point being, given all of the above, is it still so cut and dry to you? If you say yes, you arent putting yourself in the perspective of those users, and only care about yourself. Which is fine. But don't expect people to give a shit about you or your projects then. --- Now on to me. I am a Py3 evangelist. I write everything new that I need so it will work in Py3.4, and rarely say fuck it and make it work in 3.5-3.8 only. Hell, I'm even giving Pylons the port to Python3.4 that it was going to but never got, because I am a huge supporter of Pylons' model over all other Python web frameworks. Call me old fashioned. And if you do, fuck you, I'm old and grumpy. But this port won't be for public consumption, it'll be for little old me. I am not going to provide major support unless I care about the individual issue, because I am one man, and Pylons was managed by a gigantic team that decided to give up. If what I write, whatever the app, is written in such a way that it can be used in 3.4, I will also guarantee support for Py2 until at least 2025, and I know I will be writing Py2 until the day I die. Because EOL/EOS means nothing in the software world. "End of common use" does. And common is subjective to a number of factors. I'm a Py3 evangelist. Yet, ***I concede the fact that:*** ####***Py2*** ###***will*** ##***never*** #***die.***
Ahhh don’t worry just fixed it lol, I will next time tho. Thanks anyway
Thanks!
do you have trouble with any other package ? Windows can be tricky with pythonpath environment variable sometimes.
I once got this problem after configuring visual studio to write python
Hint: Google Colab
Have you tried installing using an admin command prompt? I’ve had some weird issues with Windows installing with admin vs non admin.
As a basic question i use a desktop pc with window - Portable with MBP, OSX 10.9.5 (8GB RAM + 2x SSD upgrade) **I am a very beginner**, was trying to coding a calculator with some specials, was funny but, now a year later i want to train my not having skillz again. With **Atom** and **PyCharm**Atom + Pycharm is awesome...like GUI and Fonts and Colours a lot...one of them has a good auto-complete, but...as i saying, i will get into it again ;) Atom is hopefully portable to have it at a non-coding workplace.
For real-time data, websockets would be worth considering. It would allow you to send updates with minimal latency over the network and to the front end. For the server, look in to tornado or aiohttp. You could use Lomond for the client side.
You haven't called your file [pyautogui.py](https://pyautogui.py) have you? I've done that a few times and confused myself.
this is the first module ive have trouble with
what did you do to fix it?
I agree, it's almost certainly spam... However a few of the projects were actually really neat!
Removed python from visual studio
I have uninstalled and reinstalled on an admin command prompt, still saying the same thing.

Maybe try this: pip3.6 install pyautogui 
what directory was this found under? I went under site-packages/pyautogui 
python imports things from your python path, so we should be able to trace this down by looking at the python path that pip is using and seeing if it should appear in the python when you're trying to importing it. pip show pyautogui will print the location, which should look something like c:\users\name\appdata\local\programs\python\python36-32\lib\site-packages then when you go to import the module, add import sys print(sys.path) hopefully the location that the package is installed in will appear on the python path. If not, that'll at least give you a hint as to why it's not getting imported.
I did the first 3 chapters of Automate the Boring Stuff. I’m in my 40s and have almost 0 coding experience. I want to rewrite my 1998 vintage webapp (it’s ugly but still makes money) in my spare time. Our customers log in, choose a calendar design, enter times and activities, choose the sizes and quantities they want printed and click order. The webapp generates an Excel file formatted as a calendar with with their times and activities and clip art from the template. We then print and ship. It’s been chugging along with almost no change for 20 years, but there are some problems. It loads Excel and runs macros with every order, which uses 50% CPU on the server for 2 minutes. If anyone else tries to use the site during that time it’s really slow for them. Also it’s classic ASP which I can’t seem to get working on anything newer than Server 2008. Im cheap and I want an excuse to learn some programming, so I’m gonna see what I can do. 
Okay I think you’re on to something. If that path isn’t printed by the sys.path, then what? 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Version 2.3 just about done. It adds the final two Elements that have been missing from the GUI * Sliders * List Boxes Both are completed, ready to release. [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43041172-244ecf20-8d26-11e8-9e04-5b3b7e9f5de9.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43041172-244ecf20-8d26-11e8-9e04-5b3b7e9f5de9.jpg) [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43041173-2e053338-8d26-11e8-99f0-0e551566654b.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43041173-2e053338-8d26-11e8-99f0-0e551566654b.jpg) *If you would like to use the SDK for your project but are unsure, I'll give you a hand coding the GUI portion.

The bravado!
Bravado? If I don't give a detailed rant I get downvoted by all the "Py3 is the futuuuururururururueurueue" people. I mean again I agree. But again, I concede that Py2 will never die. It's like claiming COBOL/Fortran will die.
Thanks for the detailed reply! I wasn’t expecting so much detail, but it’s very helpful. 
It's xml based, and also includes the super powerful (but tricky) zope tal macro system. I started with Jinja style templates, and once I got used to zpt style (Chameleon etc) I now like them way more. The fact that the structure of your template remains xml makes a huge readability difference. Some people love that, some hate xml templating. I'd suggest giving it a try for a project, you may get hooked, as I did! Also, Chameleon is hella fast.
`import socket`
Thanks! I feel stupid now. First python script.
You're using pycharm, you're doing network stuff, you're automating an ssh-based interface, and it looks like you're solving a _real problem you have_. You are not considered stupid. Sight unseen, I think this is a good first script. You'll probably want to /r/learnpython and ingest all of https://docs.python.org
Cool
http://cryptography.io/ ?
hint: you need to use _find(...)_ to get the index of the small string in the big string *[index -5: index + len(small_string)+ 5]* is your result there's a few details about whether small_string is with 5 characters of either end

What are your thoughts on this project any positive criticism or advice will be helpful
Its for me. I am going to study Cryptology &amp; Computers and focus on CyberSec and EH. Its kinda like a “learn the shit you’ll deal with”
Not sure if it supports all the ciphers i want to work it. Does it?
What makes it better than the popular youtube-dl app?
For them? They made it. It's nice doing things for yourself sometimes.
I started trying to build my own caesar cypher and ran into a similar problem. However when I saw a solution they didn't bother to first encode it to numbers and then back to letters they just sifted the alphabet. It was written in JavaScript on Khan academy if you look at their ciphering videos. Which are good for what you want to do.
Can you link me?
I wouldn’t say it’s more popular than YouTube Dl or better than that. I just made for fun as a side project I might turn it into a webapp or a GUI
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/cryptochallenge/a/crypto-clue-1
Exactly 👍🏻
If you look down in the comments below someone posts the Java solution. I'm on mobile right now so sending multiple links is hard.
Yes... Check if you have many Pythons and pips on your system, e.g. 2.x and 3.x. Anyways, use Conda and watch those problems go away.
No offence to you but I get this question whenever I do anything with youtube or videos, "what makes this better than youtube-dl". We don't make things to then have to come up with sales pitches for why you should use my thing over this other thing, if something interests you try it out, if not we don't make things for recognition or to develop a user base. Most of the time it's a throwaway thing we won't even be able to support in a month because we'll have moved on, but it's a unique program that might help someone else in the future as a reference for their own project. Open source is cool like that.
I found it amusing half of your actual script was ASCII text haha
Hahaha added for fun to make it look like a real script lol
Yep :) as a practice program made this when I was starting learning. I download 126GB of music and made USB library for my girlfriend so she could play all her songs in her car
Did you ever look at the book Cracking codes with python. I dont think there is a module for crypto.
Cool script! I’m sort of a stickler for well named variables so I think instead of x you could name it sth like welcome_message or something of that regard. Also, it probably would make more sense for readability to assign the exit message to a variable as well near the top of the script so for the main part we can easily see what you’re printing.
Which book? I am not sure what language are the most pentesting tools are written in. I believe Aircrack-ng was written in C but I hope that I can make one for myself in Python. With a module I believe it would be easier.
A more pythonic way of writing code is to put everything you import in a separate line. You can follow **[this](https://twitter.com/dzaporozhets/status/870268536404533249)** to write good commit messages.
Gotcha thanks 🙏🏼 really appreciate especially i really love this python community it has really helped me 
Thanks I’ll do it or you can also create a PR Suggestions and changes are always welcomed I really appreciate 🙏🏼
Hahaha nice 
It was super fun and a great learning experience. My recommendation is build a GUI to it, and freeze it. Then have your friends use it without any direction. Even if you don't get into any UX jobs it's super useful to have an idea of how people approach your programs, and how they need to respond to things you never throughout of. 
I’ll do that thanks for the tip really appreciate 🙏🏼 I was thinking to build a web app since not everyone uses gui 
So Reddit sucks at posting code examples on mobile so I wrote up a gist on github for a suggestion to reduce the download video code. But cool script! 👍 https://gist.github.com/CompSciMaj13/0cd704423c8117842032ec9a71e450c6
They can't say "I made this" about youtube-dl, but they can about THIS. That's what makes it better ...for them.
Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593278225/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_xobvBbZ08VNV7
You have some interesting print statements in your script haha. My own two cents: &gt;Maybe adding some robustness to the user input parts (catching errors and handling them) &gt;Maybe add a simple GUI where you can enter the user input all at the same time with the click of a button and a few entry fields Good job tho!
I disagree. The documentation for Django is amazing and as a beginner I never feel stuck. I can always figure out what I need to do. 
My next suggestions to shrink the code footprint is: 1. Add the warning into the first question to eliminate needing to ask too many questions. Let the user know ahead that it takes long to download audio before they made the decision. https://gist.github.com/CompSciMaj13/6539e2ddaa6a40a659f3716a9a6ee15c
Awesome job! It would be cool if it could read a CSV file filled with links and automatically download a folder of audio files (or video files) from that CSV. Something to think about if you want to practice IO streaming. Edit: I realize you’d also need error handling for when the link doesn’t work so you can go on to the next link in the CSV. Also rename the files with the name of the songs given as a column in the CSV rather than the video name. Now I’m thinking of tons of features.
When python scripts are ran via a shell like this it's common to build the script to grab the needed user inputs in the same step as running the script. So instead of running the script and then it prompting you for the Instagram search terms followed by the picture count, you feed those parameters to it as you run it. Try something along the lines of: * "python3 instagram\_scraper.py --tags Sunset --count 20" This tells the script to pass args --tag:Sunset &amp; --count:20. If you take a look at the .py script (as you should before running any unknown script...) the gist of it is like this: 1. Look for arguments passed through by the user with certain prefixes like --tags, -t, --count, -c, . 2. Pass those arguments to the main system which uses those arguments for functions it defined earlier in the script.
First, this should be in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/). Second, several of these (binary, hex, Unicode, integer) are built in primitives and have nothing to do with cryptography directly; it's unclear what you're trying to do with them. Third, the **base64** module gives you both base32 and base64 encode and decode... these don't constitute cryptography in any modern sense, but they're useful primitives to build cryptographic systems with. Fourth, the rest of these constitute at most toy crypto, more historical artifact than actually useful, so there's no general module that I could recommend, but you should look on [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/) as there's plenty of these with implementations in Python for learning from.
Any library that supports Windows and has C-extensions in it is likely to be pure Python 3.4+ simply because of compilers. Python 2.7 on Windows requires MSVC2008, which Microsoft doesn't offer an Azure subscription for. So how does one go about obtaining a copy of MSVC2008 to test with? Moreover MSVC2008 is really old, and lacks a tremendous number of optimizations for modern SIMD instructions. The reality is that most scientific computing is done on some lab machine or a laptop, which more than likely are Windows. Clusters aren't, so you're more likely to see cluster-based libraries remain in Python 2.7-land, but anything with low processing requirements is going to be sunsetted. Both NumPy and Pandas will be shortly Py3 only, and that will cascade down the module chain rather quickly. I suspect a number of proprietary Python web-backends will stay in the 2.7-zone for quite awhile as they are going to be more painful to port due to their heavy use of strings. I'm not sure if anyone active in open-source should care though. 
I don’t know why you’d use both Django and NodeJS. Django is a complete framework on it’s own and has jinja(2?) which can render dynamic content with ease and can also take requests from jquery and anything else. Then again, this is a bit out of my area of expertise.
Node and django both are server side frameworks, pick one would probably be best. I would vote for not JavaScript
I'm pretty new to this too but if I'm not mistaken this would just be a series of POST requests right? 1. Server encrypts config information and sends it via a POST request to the agent. 2. Agent decrypts config info and runs said operations. 3. Agent encrypts the small txt file and sends it via a POST request back to the server. (I'm thinking a PUT method could work too depending on the setup) 4. Server decrypts text file and stores it or does X with it. I'm guessing this could be done with something like the requests library maybe? I wouldn't be too surprised if some communication libraries actually have cryptographic methods already. If not there's a few crypto libraries that would do this. Again, I'm learning too so I might be very wrong.
I would personally recommend google compute engine. If your script isn't too cpu intense, you could run it on the free tier completely free. You could use pythonanywhere but sometimes your script may shutoff because of server migrations or something like that. Also you're restricted by the python packages and versions they have installed.
I didn't look at the code at all, but I did use the GUI for a while. I opened up various reddits and used keys for tumble and imgur scraped from github, so I learned a valuable skill in the process. The GUI is great and it turns the subreddit into an ACDSee-like slide show. The only downside is that it will skip animations and you can't bulk download the stuff you're scrolling through. I tried some other interesting things like pointing it to image search results page on google, but that didn't work. Overall, I really liked it for what it was designed to do.
Im pretty new so not much. Simply working on a fortnite database lmfao

Generators and iterators are always useful to know.
I loved this. This is really cool. I am no expert but I feel if you put those actual download lines in a function and call the function with video or audio arguments instead of rewriting those 3 lines every time. It would reduce the code. Like the other commenter suggested about UX. You should warn about the audio taking longer and then ask to choose audio or video. Edit. I see someone else wrote some code for that already. Nevermind this then
Yea I checked out google cloud but they just had so many different engines I had no idea which one to use. For now my script isn't cpu intensive but I may have some that are in the future, but it should be easy to scale. Anyway, thanks!
[Found this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300316301436)...although I doubt you'll be super thrilled about it.
Django is a framework that runs on the python programming language. Node.js is a language (implementation) that has its own web frameworks. Performance differences between python and node are largely the same. Pick a programming language you are familiar with. Then, pick a web framework for that language. Postgres is the right database though, until you know enough to know what database would be best for your specific situation and scale once you have a working site.

Some ideas: - grab the high-res image - read urls from commandline, file and/or stdin - accept YouTube ids besides just urls - multi-thread multiple downloads It has value aside yt-downloader if simple and usable without billion options.
This comment made me want to do this for myself, thanks! 
Sorry then, I ran out of ideas. I tried installing it, but everything went ok on my machine. For what it's worth I use anaconda to manage Python envs on Windows, maybe give it a shot ?
I use the smallest hetzner cloud instance.
so Guido is for 572 ?
but we still have to ask, because maybe it _is_ better in some way or an other, and in those cases we may want to use this instead (it's perfectly ok if it's just a practice side project and it's 'just' as good as the other tools)
Looks good ! Trying it later !
/r/learnpython Reading the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
&gt;So switching it so you only check for if they entered 'n'. Else is the Y. Apt only accepts 'y' or the empty string for yes, and all else is a no. Accepting "!= n" for a "yes" sounds a bit error-prone to me.

You get three free a week I think. I've been an economist subscriber for years, it's tremendously good.
I'd hate to teach someone to code in JavaScript. The different ways of iterating, let vs var ... it's very ugly. Anyway, python has very good async solutions, including in the radical concept known as the 'Standard Library'.

I wouldn't really recommend the docs in this case, they have semantics for socket programming in Python but they don't actually *teach* you any socket programing. Really op you need to read the [socket HOWTO docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/sockets.html) and if you look at the very bottom "See also" in the socket programing module documentation it tells you to read a couple papers which you should definitely check out. Ill copy paste it here. &gt;**See also** &gt;For an introduction to socket programming (in C), see the following papers: &gt;An Introductory 4.3BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial, by Stuart Sechrest &gt;An Advanced 4.3BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial, by Samuel J. Leffler et al, &gt;both in the UNIX Programmer’s Manual, Supplementary Documents 1 (sections PS1:7 and PS1:8). The platform-specific reference material for the various socket-related system calls are also a valuable source of information on the details of socket semantics. For Unix, refer to the manual pages; for Windows, see the WinSock (or Winsock 2) specification. For IPv6-ready APIs, readers may want to refer to RFC 3493 titled Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6. Edit: Also every programmer should know this, but simply googling "[topic] introduction pdf" usually returns some very high quality papers from universities, even if a bit outdated occasionally. 
Thank you :) God bless you
&gt; I don't appreciate being called a troll for doing so. It was just a stupid joke, I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings in the process. I wanted to ask you why you thought Python 3 was not a good fit for CLI, but you've answered already, and your feedback is quite interesting. (I develop a lot of little CLI tools in Python 3, but I've never worked a lot with Python 2).
Where are you getting the idea that you'll need a subscription for compiling C modules on Windows for python 2.7? The compilers have been free for a decade, it's just the IDE that's charged for. MS even provide a visual c++ for python 2.7 download: https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=44266
If I could provide a URL to a playlist and have it work through all of them, that'd be dead handy.
Hey, this is pretty cool. May I ask how you found the [https://app.snapchat.com/web/deeplink/snapcode](https://app.snapchat.com/web/deeplink/snapcode) endpoint?
Here are the options i see: 1. if your current host supports python, you can create an interface on your website that communicates with an API on your server that will trigger the appropriate CLI tools 2. you can rewrite the tools in javascript, set the appropriate CORs headers so the client can connect to the third-party APIs, and create an html/js interface accordingly (you might be able to find a python -&gt; js transpiler or something similar) 3. if your server doesn't support python, you will either have to get a new host and implement #1 or rewrite the tools in a supported language and implement #1 4. create a mobile app with python embedded in it
Thanks for the feedback. You can do bulk download: with Ctrl+A you can mark all images to be saved. Then press "c" to commit the changes, i.e. save all the images. Search results of Google / Bing must use Ajax, that's why it doesn't work. Currently I only work with the HTML, JavaScript is not interpreted. It could be a future direction.

Flit makes this much easier than setup.py. I’m a big convert in installing user made packages locally too. 
A question like this is better asked in r/learnpython. Also, your question is very broad. I wouldn't know what to answer.
Sure
edit the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` [official doc for pythonpath](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=pythonpath#envvar-PYTHONPATH)
Interesting! Nice idea for a beginning. Here's a few comments: - Classically when you have a Y/n choice and you print one in capital, that one is the default, consider making your script only if the user enters 'n' (or making your script go through even if the user just types 'enter'). - Your script exit without warning if the user enters anything but 'audio' or 'video', consider handling that in a more user friendly way - Others have pointed to some possible style improvements I suggest you take them into account.
I am well aware that most of those are “primitive to toy” ciphers. Those are the most common/widely used ciphers. Mainly in ARGs and such. The sidebar says to get help with your code etc, /r/learnpython; but I came to ask about a module, not get help for my code.

&gt; b.visit('r/http://google.com') That's not a valid url Try this: b.visit(r'/http://google.com') 'r' denotes a raw string - please read the python docs for that In future you will get better/quicker response for an issue like this by using /r/learnpython instead.
So you made code that has no earthly purpose other than to break laws. Cool story bro.
Seems like it's the same principle as 0 being False and every other number being True.
&gt; The sidebar says to get help with your code etc, /r/learnpython; but I came to ask about a module, not get help for my code. In this case, they will be the same thing. Much of what you ask is already in the standard library or quite basic for an experienced developer. 
The book that's currently mentioned in learnpython :)
“I’m working on” lol Yes, I remember when I used to work on the quadratic equation and symbolism in The Scarlet Letter, too. 
Would you mind explaining how you use short numbers, what are you looking for? Days for cover? Or percentage of shorts comparing to total issued shares? Some combination? How do you pick your potential trades?
The reason for recommending the other subreddit is that it's the better resource for questions like this, which touch on standard library modules; this one is more for discussions about the language itself. As for the ciphers mentioned -- beyond the basics I called out that are either language built ins or part of the standard library -- there's no practical use for them beyond toy code and learning exercises, which is why they're not in the normal crypto packages (cryptography, pycryptodome), and are usually just implement-yourself exercises, or copy pasted from Rosetta Code. There may well be modules on PyPi/Github that offer these ciphers, but as they're just not used in real world crypto they're unlikely to be very well known.
I created flask webapp but it has only 480p and 720p video support! I am thinking of improving interface and adding options for all available formats.. Link: https://u2bdownload.herokuapp.com/
Technically what they made is a CLI menu around [pytube](https://github.com/nficano/pytube). from pytube import YouTube link = YouTube(url) download_video = link.streams.first() download_video.download() There's no reason anybody would use this instead of youtube-dl, but as a learning exercise as a new programmer it accomplishes something practical and shows the power of the [Python library community](https://xkcd.com/353/).
I'm confused. Am I sending them my code??
In most cases we've taken something like youtube-dl or in OP's case pytube and just built on it, it's not a replacement in any way, just another frontend for someone else's library.
Nope. Microsoft is adding first party support for Python in their Language Server Protocol (LSP), which is intended to decouple language support from editors and tools. Instead of having to add Python, C and Go support for vim, Atom and VS Code (3x3=9 integrations), you add LSP support to the editors and implement the languages in LSP (3+3=6 integrations). Everything is still running on your machine.

Oh btw python is great for hacking
re-edit: by octopus companies i mean big companies
sometimes nice !
agree either node or django
did you reinvent youtube-dl?
try qpython
since you got some knowledge about youtube's inner workings, I suggest considering to join the development on youtube-dl evil doing google is known to often change stuff that breaks this tool and the project will benefit from more contributors
until 2020 only maintainance bugs fixed not security ones. as py recommends the 3 version, it is advisable to switch.
django or flask matters not for drag and drop. but js yes
nice, a jinja alternative, just now must see maintainers' activity
pushing it one step further, inspire yourself as to how tls work you can then maybe use the in-built sha256 for encryption
Whew. Thanks!
You have a fantastic attitude! Glad to have you around. Nice tool, I'm sure you learned a lot from making it. 
Oh, another idea! I think as a part of the learning experience, you should write out a blog post about your process and share with us, reflecting on some of the big ideas of making such a project.
Some people told me its slow due to it lacking multithreading and such.
&gt; but as they're just not used in real world crypto they're unlikely to be very well known What do you mean with 'real world crpyto'? 
Are you writing multithreaded programs?
I dont know if I will. But the issue is if I want to have bruteforce, people told me Python would be 'slow'.
Like SSH, HTTPS, PGP, etc, any situation in which you do not want your information being read, from messaging to disk encryption.
I read the article but I don’t quite get how you quantified subjectivity and polarity. Counting words that you deemed indicative of subjectivity or ?? I don’t know Python so perhaps it’s in there and I just did not understand.
But how will the server send information to the agent through REST API without running a REST server on the agent as well?
\--audio-quality 0
True. I reverted that change. I left the improvement of letting the user know that audio takes a long time from the first question to eliminate that extra input block.
I also plan on doing PGP and such in near future. But first I thought it would be better for me to know to to do these ciphers/cryptographs in Python. I also added MD5 and SHA1, adding other SHA types aswell. One issue is that I know they are “one way crpytographs” but I’d still like to decipher them; by bruteforcing. I don’t know how
What's the end goal here? Are you trying to sleep until a certain time on the wall clock?
I am trying to keep the process sleeping in a certain timeframe. If the clock passes the end of the frame, the process continues normally. If the clock changes to something earlier than the beginning of the frame, I raise an exception. As is, my script sleeps for 5 seconds, checks time then sleeps, returns or raises exception.
* [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) for GTK+ * [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html) for Qt.
I think you're trying to sleep in a way not broken by DST? If so, just get a monotonic clock value from the operating system (see docs for time module). Monotonic means it's guaranteed to always go in the same direction. r/learnpython would be more appropriate for this question.
Both [Pyqt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) and [Qt for python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) can use [Qt designer](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html) to design the GUI and use it at runtime.

I am trying to keep a list synced with specific timeframes. For example, items a, b, c, d correspond to 6, 12 , 18, 24 and between 6 and 12, I do something with a until 12 comes where I will do something with b until 18. What I want is to change back to a if the clock changes to something between 6 and 12. So what I need is a way to check if the clock changes abnormally.
Does your script do that "something" at a fixed interval, e.g. every 5 seconds?
It gives them a good opportunity to learn about pointer, reference, memory allocation, immutability, data type while keeping the convinience as a script language.

Only during the beginning of the interval.
Remi gui library provides a really lightweight and easy to use graphical drag n drop editor https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi It renders in browser, but don't consider it an option to make websites, it is a standard gui library. 
What do you mean by "during the beginning of the interval"? In the first hour? Or do you need to do something exactly _at_, say, 6AM wall time?
Oh then I would go with perl
I need to do some something exactly at 6am.
Then you should probably stop reinventing cron/systemd timers/Windows Task Scheduler and use the tools specifically designed for running things at specific points in time.
The problem is those times are figured out at runtime and need to adapt at runtime. 
Then you should probably just do what `cron` does and check the wall clock every second or whatever the minimum granularity for your jobs is.
There's probably a better way to do what you're doing, like maybe use the OS task scheduler itself (cron, windows scheduler etc) or just use a timer. However assuming you want to write the sync code yourself To see if the clock was changed, there are 2 things you can do. The easiest thing you can do is read the time, start a timer, and throw an error if the time isn't what it's "supposed" to be after the timer. The second is try the operating system APIs. This means you need to write platform specific code, and the user can still subvert it if they try. On windows, clock changes are logged in the event log so read the system event log and look for it. However the administrator can clear this log. I'm not sure if there's a windows API call to read a clock change event directly. That's not my area of expertise. The "correct" way to read the time is via the OS, which in python means calling function in the time module. You need to trust the user has the time set correctly and that the OS is doing DST right. The "correct" way to implement a timer is to use a monotonic clock, again in python in the time module. Again, I would seriously think about whether or not you can just use the OS time scheduler, or a timer, or whether or not you can just trust the user to have their clock right.
That’s what I am doing, I just needed to know if it’s possible to add the program to a list event observers or something that received a notification/callback when the clock was changed in an abnormal way ie by the user.
Then why do you need to know if the clock was changed? All you need to know is the next time your job needs run and the current time. If your job needs to run right now, or before now, you start it and update the next start time. If you haven't reached the next start time yet, you just sleep for another interval and re-check.
I am using the second way you have described and it’s working just fine. I was wondering if it was possible to create some kind of observer that did this. On Android there are observer objects you can register ie, when contacts list changes or call log changes and the OS would run the code under “notify” or what the function was. I was simply asking if anything like that would be possible on python in any way.
Impressive!
I'd suggest spending a lot of time reading basic texts on cryptography first. Hash functions aren't ciphers. You brute force a hash function by running through an infinite input space until the hash of your input matches the hash you know. That's true of all of them. With SHA256 and a hashed secret you know neither the length or the character space for, you'll probably be waiting until the universe has passed heat death for an answer.
The program is in a specific state during each interval, if the user changes the time, I need to make sure that the program is the appropriate state. I have figured it out anyway, I was just looking for a way other than check every X time if the clock isn’t in the range it’s supposed to.
Thanks Mate. I really appreciate
That would be a great thing to do Thanks for the suggestion I really appreciate
Hahahah Maybe 
I am well aware that hashes are not ciphers. And SHA-256 is the one of the “most secure” one right now and it will take a *looooooong* time to crack it
That's so cool dude pass me the GitHub repo link lets use my script to incorporate in the webapp what you think ?
Break Laws like what you mean 
I understand thanks for the tip mate ! I really appreciate btw you can all create PR they are always welcomed 
Name one reason you should be able to download a video. You can't repost it. It's already online to view... There's literally no reason. It's like making a nuclear bomb. It may be a thing you can do but it has no purpose other than to cause destruction.
Thanks for the tip mate !! I really appreciate you can also submit that as issue on github 
You are welcome !!
Published a tutorial that explains [how to connect Python to MySQL](https://datatofish.com/connect-python-to-mysql/).
Thanks You can do whatever you like to do in order to improve the script PR is always Welcomed
I totally disagree also Django documentation is great and by including a lot of features in the framework it really is helpful to a beginner. I have developed a similar scheduling product before and it is a fun project but beware of timezones :-) 
This looks nice! I see you used Win10toast for the notifications on windows. How was the module? Easy to use? I have been thinking of having a project use it.
https://github.com/ash-ishh/u2bdownload 
https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/
PyCrpyto is dead mate. PyCryptoDoMe is still being developed but it doesn’t cover the stuff I do need afaik
youtube-dl will do this.
You're right. Should have checked the latest release date.... Oct 17, 2013. Very outdated.
Whose they?
Yed win10toast works properly. About 20 people are using my package. They don’t give any bad feedback about windows notification:).
I would say that instead of doing things like: while True: if True: if True: # things Do: while True: if False: continue if False: continue # things This prevents your code from being excessively nested, similar to [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/). There's probably a term for this method of logic but I don't remember it. Edit: Guard Clauses, thank you /u/nick_t1000
Reading between the lines you have included node in your stack to use websockets. Django channels will provide that for you so I would stick to Django with Django channels and not bother with node js in my opinion. Beyond web sockets I have used Celery mostly in conjunction with Django for anything that can be done async
Nice! If you did want to try to turn it into a web app, an easy start to it if you're unfamiliar to web applications would be to modify one I made. It's a web app wrapper around the youtube-dl cli where the user simply inputs a URL and then it downloads it in the background and gives it back to the browser. It probably wouldn't be too hard to switch it out with your downloader, and then you could modify the website as you see fit from there. Let me know if you want me to link it, or just check my post history for it.
I created a desktop application with Python that uses Youtube-dl to download youtube videos as audio but I can change it to do videos as-well.
I recommend Zeit Now (https://zeit.co/now). It's a cloud host with a free plan for open source projects. Use their Docker deployment service to run your Python scripts. I can recommend the service wholeheartedly, really simple to use, no issues whatsoever for me.
I would say setup flask or whatever python web framework, but honestly configuring that stuff can be challenging. Especially im guessing you are using cpanel host. Just write a php script and use system("python myscript.py $arguments") to call your already working script. Write a form or something to fill in the arguments. If you have dependencies, you can get away with including the packages in the same folder as the script as long as they dont require compiling. Oh and maybe make sure that $arguments string is locked down. Ha!
What in that email shows this?
Good. Well as you read up on them you'll learn that it's essentially pointless to brute force any secret you don't know the length and character space for, even with weaker algorithms like MD5 and SHA1. Which is why they're usually not broken by brute force, but instead through precomputed rainbow tables.
Callback hell is when you're using callbacks; here you're conflating it with just highly nested blocks. Your second example uses *guard clauses*.
I needed up reinstalling it completely like 10 tines to get it to work and finally did. It was so bizarre 
I mostly want to enable brute for Vigenere, Caesar, MD5 and SHA1; “simple” ciphers/hashes Also any way to place dictionary/passwords like rockyou.txt etc in Python?
Thanks, updated my comment
Should I add this setting? "python.jediEnabled": false
It seems like it's really Dec 1. &gt; Jan 1: Deadline to choose the new leader(s), if not already chosen by Dec 1
I’m going to rant a little here... the comment about “I have no place in security programming” is just... sad to me. Anybody who writes, or plans to write code has an obligation to implement secure coding practices. You can’t “layer on” security after the fact. You can, but it’ll be defeated. I encounter this mentality daily by so many new and younger programmers, it’s scary. Hell, even old-timers do it because security wasn’t as broad years ago. Security isn’t “sexy”, so I guess it’s just overlooked by teachers and those wanting to get their feet wet. If you’re like me, and in a position to influence, we need more mentors!
I understand I just have no clue about programming security into something. I've never built anything with network capabilities aside from a few websites with HTML. I've done python programming but only as basic desktop programs that have no network capabilities built in. That's why i said what I did. When I was learning to code nobody ever spoke about security. I'm 19 so I guess I'll take a programming class when I go to college maybe they will have priority on teaching security in code.
It’s a good habit to develop early. I completely understand the excitement of getting to the “it works” stage, but you’ll save yourself a lot of heartache implementing it early. You’re also in HIPAA territory, so extra scrutiny is warranted.
Cool! I actually support they're change in version numbers. From the changelog : - Switch to a Calendar based versioning scheme. - Formally document our deprecation process as a minimum of 6 months of deprecation warnings. Adopt and document NEWS fragment writing style. - Switch to releasing a new, non bug fix version of pip every 3 months.
Any book recommendations on SQL for beginners?

Aruba. It super cheap vps 
&gt; Jan 1: Deadline to choose the new leader(s), if not already chosen by Dec 1. Didn't Guido just take a permanent vacation? How can they choose a new one if he hasn't officially stepped down?
If you have an instance running on Digital Ocean there's no reason to not just use that. Running a Python script as a `systemd` service or just in a `screen` session is very easy. Unless your script is chewing up all the resources on the DO instance you'll be fine. A virtual machine on DO is a full blown Linux system, you can do just about everything on a single instance you'd do on your own computer. 
But nothing in this email says PEPs won't be accepted until then.
They technically can't, because he can come back at any time. But he is "allowing" them to choose their own governance, and that can include "leadership".

Somebody advise **Learning SQL** by Alan Beaulieu to me. I read some of it and find it to be too detailed. It might be good for beginners though.
So why doesn't the interpreter and its tools all use the same versioning system? Python 3.9 -&gt; Python 18? Python 3.18?
Thanks posted it there.
Hey man any chance I can take a look at what you've been working on? I have some time, and I keep coming on dead ends looking at different live data schemes 
He's still the king, but they can choose a prime minister.
Nice article and is consistent with what I would have expected. I don’t mind the data cleansing as much though. One last thought regarding the last chart: “Data Rwanlging”
&gt; Adopt and document NEWS fragment writing style. What does that mean exactly?
I've found with scheduling tasks on OSX is that where previously relative paths were OK, suddenly I had to make everything absolute (including the reference to Python). This was using launchd though. So this might be the issue – it may not be finding the text file, so it clears out the spreadsheet.
Doesn't make sense. CalVer is for projects that have a release cycle tied to the calendar. Python doesn't have that. Imagine how confusing it would be for Python changelogs. Plus, in production Python users rarely "upgrade" their Python installations.
Do you have any luck using Alpha Vantage with zipline?
I'm looking for open source project on python for contributing in it.
It might be. Though the script is appending so even if the text file doesnt have information it just adds empty columns. I also tried using the python launcher to run the script(would be much easier just to run a program through automator) but the launcher just doesnt seem to find the modules (pandas,openpyxl) which python has. I feel like I’m stuck at the very end and it’s terribly annoying
finally pip is old enough to vote

Different way of maintaining a changelog. To hazard a guess without looking at the repo they're probably using something like towncrier or reno to manage release notes rather than requiring changes to the changelog file directly. 
&gt; To make this clear -- right now, there is no-one who can approve this PEP, and you will have to wait until 2019 until there is. https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-July/154723.html
Some editors or ide can interfere with interactive or gui code when you run it from within the editor because they wrap the output device for some reason or other (debugging etc) or they're just plain shit (in the case of idle).
Haha! Yes, it is for a class that I'm currently taking. I'm not savvy enough with this language yet so I'm just looking for a few pointers.
Thanks so much for the tip. I haven't gotten anything to work just yet but I have a week left for the assignment. I'm sure I'll get there. I appreciate your time!
Users are going to create files with all sorts of characters in; you better be able to handle it. Also if you're using Python you can read directories via a standard library call, and then you don't have to parse `ls` and get broken by spaces.
Oops! So sorry for the post in the wrong sub-reddit. I'll be sure to move beginner type questions to the appropriate place. Thanks for pointing that out.
Okay, yeah, this email does show what the title claims. Thank you. The email linked in this post did not.
PythonAnywhere.com. It is “batteries included,” and their free accounts are reasonable. But I do love cocalc. Tons of features, very easy to use interface, customer support from the creator himself... the “killer” feature for me is that it has Google Docs style collaboration with everything, from notebooks down to the command line. The perfect thing for teaching coding. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
And language design. 
I didn't notice the "Data Rwanlging" until you pointed it out. And what about "Feedbacking back to colleagues"?
Just so you know, I was not controlling the mouse, keyboard or scrollbar.
&gt; Switch to releasing a new, non bug fix version of pip every 3 months. That will basically make it mandatory to upgrade pip as the very first thing you do after installing python or creating a venv. I guess it will help best practices.

Except good game dev? Guess in which code was world of tanks written?!
Why such a huge jump in version number? Why 18? Why not 11?
Python be like, "I'm not a robot. I'm a snek." 
Also check out [Kivy](https://kivy.org/). I think there's a visual designer for it.
Not bad at all, but a bit of a shame that I've known your little trick for the 18 years that I've been using Python.
I now it's not new, but I wanted to share it with the community. I'm sure there are people that don't know it. 
Because the current year is 2018
Probably they're moving to a year-based numbering scheme, like Ubuntu, rather than semver (or whatever they're currently doing). 
old enough to drive
Dope Man ! it worked !Thanks you so much . i really appreciate it... its all these small little things newbs gotta figure out.. i really enjoy just using the command line to do most things... i really like Python. 
AWS works great for me. Free Tier should be enough for a start
I don't see much difference pragmatically between stepping down and a permanent vacation. In either case he's not doing the job anymore and the community, especially those closest to the center, need to come up with a replacement governance model.
\t means tab which is just the same thing. in a way it's a short cut for \x09 \t = \x10 is new line. the same way other ascii chars, say \x36 will just give you "6"
so it's just the interpreter using the predefined tab and newline character values instead of the hex value?
it's just the interpreter giving the same thing (some byte) a special name (tab)
pip legal now boys
do you know why they print those characters instead of hex? Is it just to make some table python uses multi-use instead of having multiple tables with effectively the same function?
Working on my college project for this semester. I have to make a system where I have to get data from a website and then make an excel file out of it and then use that data for my website which will be on django framework. On that website I have to do some analysis of the data I used before from excel file. Currently I am successful in fetching the data from website. Will work on implementing that data in coming days. 
Fine tuning home assistant, one of the coolest open source python projects
It looks like they're following OpenSUSE's numbering scheme now (which went from 13.2 to 42.1 through 42.3 then back to 15).
It's software, not wine. 
What are you exactly trying to do? Depending on your use case there might be several solutions. If you are trying to make something like a dashboard and dont mind it being web. Grafana is a great and simple solution. If you are looking for something mobile TouchOSC is great and has a drag and drop ui generator. 
Hey are you sure the script is executing fine when you try to use automator. Have you tried something like crontab? That's what I usually use and seems to work alright. 
What on Earth for?? How does that make *any* sense?
Ill try it tomorrow, the plan was to use as little non native programs as possible as im gonna have to put the script on a lot of computers. Thanks for the advice!
A lot of people tend to have problems with running code with automator due to the way they call python. In the interactive shell it is usually enough to type python3 script.py. But in automator you might need to specify full path. Something like /usr/local/bin/python3. Think that might be the issue. 
... and this is why I check Reddit. Something like this would scare me if I saw it first in a terminal.
Sadly i tried that and all sorts of different approaches (like just opening the script with automator and running it with macros(which doesnt work because the editor becomes inactive), the python launcher and more). Im gonna try the mentioned program and maybe windows task schedule.
This sounds like the python launcher is using a different install location of python compared to the shell command. You might have installed python several different ways, maybe using homebrew, and maybe using the mac os install on the python page causing 2 seperate installs
Is it just a script with hard coded screen coordinates?
That is exactly what happened, as i said im a beginner especially on mac python and got all sorts of confused when installing modules and such so i just started spamming the terminal, using homebrew, getting the python on the page and having the native python on the mac. 🤯 any idea how to get out of this mess?
Shitpost this to the programmerhumor sub. 
No. It uses pyautogui to recognize the icons and click on them accordingly.
Because semver is too damn hard when your fucking up the ecosystem
Don't worry, that's how I messed up my mac and thought python wasn't working on my mac for a while when I got started. You should start off by uninstalling all the different versions, and maybe start with a clean install using just one method. Looking at what you are trying to achieve, running the program on a lot of computers, i think one of the easiest ways would be looking into writing a bash script, that would take care of first using terminal to install the python version you need, then install the required packages, and finally add a single line to your crontab file that will run the program every hour, or every reboot or so on. This would then be as simple as running the bash script on each computer and you would have everything set-up. You might not even need to run the python install since os x seems to come preinstalled with a version of python if version isnt too much of an issue for you. 
I feel like this way, it's as if he's backdoored himself into the process permanently. If he hasn't officially stepped down, he could theoretically at any time just return from vacation and depose whatever replacement leader(s) the new governance model has elected.
I wonder if you could integrate this with selenium, would probably be very useful in scraping pages that have captcha protection. 
If this goes poorly, Python will suffer a slow and steady decline. It may take 10 years, but it will eventually fester into cancer. I have been deep in the bowels of other OSS projects (I am looking at you Apache Software Foundation), and there can be some real disease that stifles innovation and drives away talent. I really really really hope Python stays above this.
I always thought it verified the mouse movements to check if you are human or not, but your script makes the pointer just teleport to the check box. Can you explain what you did? Does it recognizes the check button and just tries to click it at its sides?
No reason why it can't be both. Anyone want to start a ```pip``` wine label?
# Alternative style: 11.0.0.post180722 This type of semantic versioning is also acceptable in PyPI, if the date needs some emphasis. The ".post" suffix may also be appended to, say, 11.1.0a, 11.1.0b, 11.1.0c /11.1.0rc -- alpha, beta, release/candidate, respectively.
Uses the towncrier project. Documented here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/development/#adding-a-news-entry
Thanks, the phrasing they used just have no Google results when I looked.
Yeah they should stick to the regular system that software's always used. Like windows 95 or office 2000.
Thanks! As always keeping stuff clean fixes everything. Ill try setting a clean install for python. Will have to look in to bash scripts but it sounds like it should work great
Is this just for yourself, or are you launching a service for others? I also wouldn't undervalue the time and frustration with doing this locally. How much money will AWS cost you? 
Pip Boy is no more.
Also, &gt; The Lambda free tier does not automatically expire at the end of your 12 month AWS Free Tier term, but is available to both existing and new AWS customers indefinitely It sounds like a million requests a month is free and costs 20 cents per each additional million after that. I'd personally the pay the 20 cents and not worry about it. https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/
Realistically if that was to happen and it wasn't in line with what leadership at the time wanted, the project would be forked and we'd have a shitstorm over which python was the right python.
Found the issue. I needed to add the term 'with gil' to my cython code. 
Stick with Lambda, as mentioned above the free tier lasts forever. As far as running locally check this out: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/introducing-aws-sam-local-a-cli-tool-to-test-aws-lambda-functions-locally/
Right? My initial reaction was, "Holy shit, they broke their api 7 times in between versions?! How?"
Awesome work, Would you please share the source or consider contributing your method to https://github.com/mikeyy/nonoCAPTCHA (another library that tries to beat recaptcha. Are you using proxies? Does this always work first attempt, or do you get blocked after a couple?
Hey there - Jupyter + Binder team member here! \*waves\* Some thoughts on each of your options: https://cocalc.com (SageMath) I haven't used this before for this use-case, but the sagemath folks are great! https://mybinder.org/ (Jupyter) People use Binder for teaching classes / tutorials / etc all the time. You shouldn't worry too much about uptime (if you're curious, we publish all of our cluster stats at grafana.mybinder.org. The biggest drawback is that students will lose their session when they close the window or are inactive. Your best bet there is to have people download notebooks they've written to their computer when they're done. The biggest benefit to binder is that you have a lot of control over their environment, and it is perhaps the closest to what students would be doing if they worked from their own machines (since it's just vanilla Jupyter Notebooks / Lab) https://notebooks.azure.com/ (Microsoft) Really nifty service that uses a JupyterHub to manage instances on Azure. Drawbacks are that you don't have as much ability to control the environment users have, and you need users to create microsoft accounts etc. https://colab.research.google.com/ (Google) Similar problem to the Azure Notebooks solution (the Collab and Azure notebooks are basically the same pros/cons, though Collab is neat in that it integrates more with google drive). https://datalore.io/ (JetBrains) I've never used this one, but it seems interesting! (friendly and obviously biased note on all of the above...of each of the services described above, mybinder (and jupyterhub more generally) are the only fully open-source implementations of this kind of service. Just a thought ;-) Another option you might wanna check out is a project we've been working on the last few months, called "The Littlest JupyterHub". The goal of this is to simplify and shorten the JupyterHub deployment so that you run it on a single VM instead of on kubernetes (which is what binder and z2jh.jupyter.org use). Check it out and see if looks useful! https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html 
Python will print printable ASCII characters instead of the hex code when it can. Try using 65 instead— it will show “A”, not 0x41.
Not pure, c++ is involved too
Using Django with the admin interface could be a very easy, effective option.
We already have shitstorms about 2v3, and about tons of tools, the most recent to be included that I know of is the whole pipenv vs poetry debacle. As other communities have other giant shitstorms. You won't stop the shitstorms from being started.
There's also a .dev suffix I use to put dates in pre-alpha projects and projects where .a, .b, and .rc don't make sense. Like 0.1.16dev20180625
Yes, mostly people who cannot use a search engine, hence the same questions get asked over and over again.

If you use postgres, pgadmin would be ok too as long as you trust your users and can teach them to navigate the tree on the left.
I'm not sure what you're getting at here? You're just clicking the checkbox programmatically, which in itself has no effect whether or not the challenge pops. Hell, even entirely synthetic events are fine for that, as the below gif demonstrates. https://imgur.com/a/iP2JEWV AFAIK Google hasn't specified exactly how captchas work, but it's speculated it's somehow behavioral, so if you tried to use this for scraping it'd stop working fairly quickly. P.S. running tests against webpages with a captchas is an already solved problem as per [this link](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq#id-like-to-run-automated-tests-with-recaptcha-v2-what-should-i-do), you add those keys to it in the testing environment and the captcha will always pass.

I think you're mixing up how things are shown and what things are. \n is the way you display a raw newline. If you enter "\x0a" it will display as \n. `"\x0a" == "\n"` is true because `ord('\n') == 10 == 0x0a`. (ord is the built in function for telling what the number of the Unicode code point is for a given character) If you really want to see the raw hex values of the byte array, you can use something like `'_'.join('{:02x}'.format(c) for c in a)` to see a string with the hex values of all the bytes in the array. (The underscore is to visually separate them)
That almost certainly wouldn’t work. reCaptcha scans your browser history to determine if you’re likely a human or a robot. If your browser history looks suspicious, it presents you an actual CAPTCHA challenge where you have to identify images, which is very hard to automate (intentionally so). Since Selenium usually creates a browser version with no browsing history, the reCaptcha would immediately present a high-level CAPTCHA challenge. Also, rapid and repeated use of reCaptcha will eventually also flag your browser as a possible bot and present tougher CAPTCHA challenges, no matter what your browser history looks like. This solution works for simple uses (and is cool!) but isn’t scalable.
Um it sounds like you just want a python rest server with something like flask
cool. next time it fucks me over, I'll just fuck it back.
Google doesn't care how you move your mouse or how you click on the checkbox. You could even click the checkbox with Javascript and it still wouldn't care. It's more concerned with your accounts age if you are logged in, user-agent, if you have any Google related cookies stored and it's age, and what IP you are sending your requests from and how many times it's done it in the last hour. Check https://github.com/mikeyy/nonoCAPTCHA But good work, keep at it! Edit: Can't forget that it also matters how your Javascript is evaluated, for instance if you are using some Javascript emulator/driver. There is some weird code in the backend that does a bunch of precalculations to determine the "authenticity" of your browser. Oddly enough using Chrome with a Firefox user-agent still tends to work although at a lower a rate, even using Windows device details for navigator properties when on Linux or vice-versa doesn't really matter.

Got 3 contracts going on right now. * One is REST API server in Flask that is serving information about houses (think Zillow alike website) through GraphQL and with PostgreSQL as a database. Whole thing is hosted on dev/prod ec2 instances with automatic deployments, unit tests and all that. A second project I am parallely doing here is a scraping engine done in Scrapy that is able to scrape about a dozen of sources from the internet and store it in a raw format in the database with a datetime timestamp which indicates when this data is last scraped. Then there would be a script that will parse and normalize this data and import it to the other database to be used by REST API backend. Scraping engine is medium-big sized so far, has a lot of tweaks and we plan to put it behind rotating proxies in the future. * Another project is also a Flask server that provides an API to call which will return you parsed version of any news article by title/publish date/author/text, etc. In the background when this API is called, it downloads the news article with requests library and parses it through a base parser class that is able to catch about 50-60% of the articles properly out there. If not, the base class is subclassable and only takes a few lines of code to extend it and write custom logic for a specific news website. All the parsing logic in the parser classes is mostly done with BeautifulSoup, lxml and a sprinkle of regex. * The 3rd project is just starting but I am supposed to jump in a 40% existing Flask server and get it to the completion. I have no idea what code quality to expect. SQLAlchemy, GraphQL and all that fluff. Fixed deadline and timeframe of 3 weeks x 30 hours. When this project starts there will be tons of work, but it will be good money.
instagram and facebook have both given talks on this at pycon. instagram claim to be the worlds largest python codebase to be migrated. you can find them on pyvideo or youtube
Thank you. Didn't see that. Ill stick with Lambda then
What sort of advantages are there for using this over Eel?
Yea, wasn't mixing it up, just wondering why it printed the way it does. /u/shadowycore pointed out what i was looking for, that python prints the ASCII characters if the character code is part of the string. Still kinda wonder *why*, like what is the technical reason or design decision for it doing so, but I guess that's for another day.
Webdrivers have a navigator property "webdriver" set to true. If you inject some code to override that property to false then you could get it to work. But then you need worry about proxies to do it frequently. Selenium was one of my first attempts at trying to break reCAPTCHA - https://github.com/mikeyy/PySeleniumReCAPTCHA/blob/master/run.py Now I've moved on to using Chrome DevTools Protocol for controlling multiple Chrome browsers to automate the process. The finished code is at - https://github.com/mikeyy/nonoCAPTCHA

2v3 is pretty much dead at this point
TIL Ubuntu's versions are year-based. Don't know how it took me this long!
TIL from you, thanks
but towncrier integration works better with calver
Docker did a similar change last year. Confused the shit out of me at 1st
old enough to party
The TLJH you mention is AMAZING! In 10 minutes I managed to setup on digital ocean a multi-user Jupyter environment just by following the steps you so clearly laid out. I already noticed your team is super nice when interacting briefly on Gitter, and for the wonderful service mybinder is, but you guys ROCK. I'll check with my supervisor how he likes this. Quick question: where can I learn more about https in the JupyterHub login? And to deploy notebooks do I just rsync them from a root console to the /home/jupyter-xxx directories? Also thanks for sharing your experience and thoughts on the listed free services, very helpful too.

Even better: YEAR.MONTH based. Every release is in april and october, hence the XX.04 and XX.10 numbering. Only Dapper Drake is different (6.06) as it had a two month delay.
Really liked this article! I dont know if it is possible, but have you tried tunning the textblob library for the context of your search? 
It really, really isn't unfortunately.
No one relevant is doing work on python 2 implementations at this point. There's nonsense like tauthon, and people who haven't yet ported.
This isn't true at all. I refer you to my [most recent copypasta rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/90t376/question_about_python_2_endoflife_significance/e2sxjlp/)
Thank you! I have not. But I would be looking into trying I'd you can. 
Most of those objections are not relevant. The differences between py2 and three for education are slight (any my Alma mater is on 3 already), grumpy is a dead project afaik, and sure, there are dead packages, but many, if not most, have replacements.
They are not slight, grumpy isn't a dead project. Replacements or not, companies are still on Py2. What about the damned React build system? What about reddit itself? You can't call things not relevant just because you haven't encountered them. It's like saying the stock market isn't relevant to you because you hold no stocks.
ELI5: Won't this obviously break in a century? Seems like a silly Y2K type issue they're setting up. Serious follow up question: does no one think the pip project will last that long?
if you want simplicity vultr just hands you a vpn for 2.50 a month. I run scripts on that
I think they would just get him to resign by threatening to resign en masse. If they didn't want him there, which maybe isn't that likely.
&gt;They are not slight, grumpy isn't a dead project. The last commit was over 6 months ago. Its a dead project. You may still use it, but its not supported by anyone (and wasn't finished when they stopped working on it). Its dead. &gt;Replacements or not, companies are still on Py2. Sure, and then still have a year and a half to port. &gt; What about the damned React build system? This was fixed in [2016](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/1b7066ed6f862efe69ba552f7a5c30a8f5507821) (react currently has 0 python files and 0 references to "python" or "py"). &gt;What about reddit itself? What about it? That they're porting to python3 on an as-needed basis? That absolutely sounds like a reasonable strategy to me. Facebook has ported the majority of its code, and will likely be 100% py3 by the EOL. Instagram did already, I expect Google to meet the deadline as well, millions of lines of glue code included. Porting code to be python3 compatible is trivial in almost all cases (at least if the python2 code you were working with was well structured). I've ported a bunch myself, and watched as a lot more is ported. If you're declaring python2 support for 5 years past the EOL of python2, you're not what anyone would call a python3 evangelist.
It will obviously not break in a century. Year 2100 is version 100.0 year 2101 is version 101.0, etc.
In a century, just make it 100, 101, etc. At this point, it's hard to say for certain if any current software will last another 82 years. If we get sufficiently advanced natural language processing and AI for use in software development, Pip and Python could both easily become largely obsolete. Nobody in the 1950s would have guessed that we'd have smartphones with virtual assistants capable of speech recognition today. There's no reason to think we even have a clue what 2100 will look like.
I know man, I'm right there with you. Glad I could help.
I totally agree with you on this but I wonder isn’t YouTube-dl doing the same thing 
Nice that’s really cool 😎 
Why try reinventing the wheel why not use your lol that’s actually a better idea 💡 
I see I should do that Anyways thanks for the tip mate !!
Nice 👍🏻 
I updated my economy simulator to version 6.1. Feels good. It's very small, but I like it.
pip can for loop me any time
Because they're totally different software projects I'd imagine.
I love it!

I'd recommend checking out a little tool called `nbgitpuller` (https://github.com/data-8/nbgitpuller) for distributing notebooks to students. It's what we use to distribute content for a course we run here at Berkeley and works nicely! (and is pre-packaged with TLJH). For HTTPS, I know for sure that some of the jupyterhub team were working on this but I don't think it's enabled out of the box yet. The project is still quite young :-)
You might not know it but Python has already ran its course! Modern compiled languages can be as expressive, some even have interpreted solutions. Like the rise of Python it might take a decade but eventually it will happen. Part of Pythons problem is the desire to make python into one of these modern languages instead of making Python better at what it already does. By the way no one should worry, it literally will take several decades (maybe more) for Python to go entirely away.

You mean pip is old enough to install adult packages 
From my perspective yes it seems like Youtube-dl is doing the same thing
The future is now.

Yup then they must be violating the youtube laws too

Hah disagree on that. I think python still had the best mix of syntax goodness to ability to save boilerplate. Mypy adds both typechecking at compiletime and the potential for massive performance boosts.
 &gt; Switch to a Calendar based versioning scheme. I'm wondering how the versioning would look like in 2118 (if pip is still a thing) \#RemindMeIn100Years
jQuery's fallen out of fashion a bit as web APIs have caught up - unless you're pretty sure you have to support some gnarly old browsers you may be able to do without it.
I can’t think of any points that would justify waiting. I would say if you want to learn another language just start reading and tinkering.
High level languages like Python and Javascript tend to hide machine level details like memory allocation and memory addresses. Lower languages like Java and C++ will expect you to consider the effects of allocation more. For example, in Java, an array has a set size which can't change; to grow the array you really just allocate a new one and copy contents over. In C++, you can point to any variable and manipulate it, even inside an array or structure; this can be disastrous if you de-allocate the memory for that variable but don't stop the code that has a pointer to it. It is really invaluable to learn the low-level mechanisms that make data structures like `set([4, 5, 'hello'])` possible, so you can have a more instinctive feel for what is fast and what is slow when you loop billions of iterations. I think it's also useful to understand IEEE floating-point for its implications on mathematical accuracy. I have taught a number of new coders about C by telling them to implement `strtok()` and other string routines... this is a great way of cementing a respect for pointers and also for high-level languages which hide them entirely.
I don't see a problem with version 118.0.
Wait, what? There is something called poetry now? And I only just upgraded from virtualenv to pipenv...
As a pyglet contributor and user, congrats on the release. It's good to have options in the ecosystem, so I'm happy that pygame is being maintained and improved. Are you guys still working towards SDL2?
A language can be dead and still be around as legacy code. COBOL is a dead language, but there is tons of COBOL code from decades ago which is still being maintained and running today. Py 2 is in a similar boat now. The community has moved on. That isn't to say we won't see a line of python 2 code anymore, but rather all new development will be in newer python. Py 2 is a legacy language now.
I very much doubt that with the major version of 11 it was following semver before.
They introduced assignment expressions. j/k
I'm a huge Oracle guy, and I shit my pants when they moved from 11g to 18c.
There are plenty of guis for python. PyQT, wxpython, or the built in tkinter are the biggest ones. All of them you can design the gui and execute code based on gui conditions like button clicks. I would look into each one and figure out what works best for you. PS if it is commercial make sure to look into license. For insurance you can't use PyQT for commercial use. 
Guys here's the demo https://vimeo.com/281200561

Thanks! :)
Thanks man!
Since you’re asking about big enterprise projects, I feel a bit qualified to answer that. Sure, there are some Python projects, no doubt. A bit more common in finance than anything else; however if you look at old-school enterprises and not necessarily the cool kids (isn’t Facebook “enterprise” now, though? 😀), Java and .Net seem to be by far the predominant platforms. Probably more Java as the amount of libraries, servers, and solutions is absolutely staggering. Will you find Python? Absolutely, but for every Python job in the enterprise there’s likely 5x .NET and 10x Java, or inverted depending on location. However, I see a lot of Python in startups and smaller companies that have yet to build themselves a unified enterprise stack (and thus tie themselves into a major platform).
[Active fork of grumpy](https://github.com/alanjds/grumpy). They will not port in that year and a half. It costs more to port than to keep it running. Interesting on the React thing, guess I'll need to find another egregious example now. You expect these people to meet the deadline, even though many companies stay on Java 5-7 even though the current version is 10. Porting large codebases is anything but trivial. Call me what you want. Just because I know I unfortunately have to support Py2 for longer and write Py2 code for at least another decade doesn't mean I *want* to.
Poetry implements automatic creation and handling of pyproject.toml, which does a lot of what Pipfiles do and more (with the added benefit that pip actually supports pyproject.toml, but still doesn't support Pipfiles, for god knows what reason).
Too soon. 
It would be confusing when the year 3000 is version 1000.0.
A dead language is one that isn't used in every day use. Legacy != dead. Yet unfortunately COBOL/Fortran *are* done quite a lot in the continued support and maintenance of legacy systems, one company that is quite open about this is actually Bloomberg-- they still actively hire COBOL developers (and probably Fortran as well, in 2006/7 they had 25million active lines of Fortran code). New development that doesn't have to interact with these old systems will still be in Py2. If you don't believe me, mark my words and come back here in a decade to tell me I'm wrong.
This here is why the drinking age is asinine in the US. You'd trust someone to vote for the future of the country more than them handling their body. Makes no sense to me.
Yet here we are still have cobol engineers...
&gt;Active fork of grumpy. Ish, there have been *3* nontrivial changes outside of grumpy-tools. Everything else has been version changes and command line interface modifications. &gt;Interesting on the React thing, guess I'll need to find another egregious example now. Given that your egregious example is bordering on 2 years old, I'm surprised someone else hadn't called you on it yet. You're reaching for examples from when the python3 wall of shame was at 60-70% compatibility, not &gt;95%. &gt; Porting large codebases is anything but trivial. I'm involved in porting *the specific* python codebase you repeatedly mention as being large and difficult to port. Most of the work is trivial.
No it won't break in a century. Look at the current year. It breaks in a millennia.
It's debatable if it's really an API change or not and devs don't want to deal with that.
Last time i checked it's not the year 10.

You need to close your int input with another parenthisi at the end. Choice = int(input("Enter choice:"))
Also as a tip, always look above in the code before where it says the syntax error is. 
I think this is true for any language, even spoken ones. I learned a lot about English grammar when I studied Spanish because seeing how you can do things differently shows you things you hadn't considered before. I took a course on language design in college where we learned Python, Java, OCaml, Lisp, and Prolog. It have me a deeper understanding of languages I already knew and made learning new languages easier.

We use Google Cloud at work, and I think it is not hard to navigate. If you want just normal linux machine, from the menu you go to: Compute Engine -&gt; VM Instances -&gt;Create instance [button], and then on the screen you specify hardware [default is 1xCPU and 3.75 GB RAM]. For simple script, you could just use "small" instance, which is one shared CPU and 1.7GB RAM. Then you choose OS, for example Ubuntu 17.10 or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will both give you python 3.6. Then hit "Create" and you VM is ready in about 1 min.

I've been writing some scripts to help plan future travels. I have one where you provide a list of places in a .txt file and it gets the wikipedia summary of the place, so I can read them before I go to each location. Another one I wrote uses the googlemaps package to get geocodes from the list of places (like above) and calculates Euclidean distance between the destination and the origin (i.e. hotel) and sorts it in ascending order. This helps me quickly plan out a day's schedule. Just signed up for Google Maps Platform and will use the distance from Maps instead of Euclidean distance. Eventually, I'm going to use clustering of hotels in order to identify city centers, so when I look for hotels in the future, I know immediately what area I want to stay in. If anyone knows a place to get a list of hotels in a city (without scraping), please let me know. Thanks!
Not necessarily, Node is often also used to compile frontend code into a big ball of .js (e.g. webpack) I only use node for that reason for example, because I don't really like server side JS, I would rather choose Go first for that purpose.
Poor npm
See my other comment why. Node can also be used to compile frontend code, e.g. webpack, in which case it can make sense with a Django project. Node doesn't always have to be used as a backend language.
They can choose a Hand of the King.

Scans your history? Source?
Nothings changed but they live underwater 
The essentials in Python are shared with every language. Take PEDMAS for example, which is a basis for doing complex mathematical calculations. But since python cuts down of the lenght of the project, you may find it odd too see the amount of code nessesary for simple actions. Your print ("Hello! ") In Python is #include &lt;iostream&gt; using std::cout; void main() { cout &lt;&lt; " Hello C++ \n"; system ("pause"); } In Cpp. So start off simple and buils your way up. You start connecting languages naturally along the way. Best of luck in your future endevours.

Have a really, really good reason before you try to learn C++. That being said, you should learn C, just perhaps not use it very much.
Nothing ... Except asyncio. Except if the gevent (embedded with eel) breaks your stack, or your freezed exe (which was my case)
Forget 1000 years, I will brag forever if any of my code ever reach 100 years of life.
Learn algorithms and data structures, which apply in all languages for solving problems. Then learn some computer architecture so you understand what pointers and memory management are actually doing. And then learn the specifics of implementing C++ for example and design patterns. But really algorithms and data structures are the best bang for your buck in terms of being used everywhere.
I guess they learned some stuff from Windows.

Happy Python instructor and mybinder user here. I just set up a link to my teaching Github and it worked splendidly. This way the students who have trouble installing Anaconda or have loaner laptops can follow along just fine.

Current focus is just getting python to login with a username and password I am currently messing around with beautiful soup but am not sure it’s the right tool to do the job I want. Bit of a noob
Are your integration tests running independently of your microservices (meaning they’re hitting the microservices that are running in a production, staging, or test environment outside of your CI environment)? Or do your integration tests require your microservices be installed / running in the same CI environment? If the environments are independent, then I think the choice between your options 1 and 2 is one of preference. I’ve seen and worked with both approaches, and they are both quite viable and maintainable. Choosing between the two, I’d base the choice on the complexity of my microservice dependencies and my test matrix (for example, are your integration tests running against different versions of your individual microservices? Against combinations of those different versions?) The more complicated your dependency/test matrix, the more inclined I’d be to using the `setup.py` approach because it it can simplify the management of your conditional dependencies. If the environments are not independent, then I’d be more likely to recommend the `setup.py` approach, perhaps coupled with a private PyPi repository for easy installation of your microservices. This might be overkill for a small set of microservices, but it gives you maximal flexibility for how to build and manage conditional dependencies in your CI environment. But again, both options 1 and 2 are viable and manage-able: it’s largely a question of preference, I think, and YMMV. Hope this helps! Chris

Does this mean the internet will start making PIP-chan memes?
A lot of systems still have 3.5 as default.

Thank you for saying what the library is. Most people probably know but for us newbs it's good to be able to determine whether or not this is something I should look at based on the title. Too many of these posts are "Project Quicksilver release version 0.8!" assuming everyone knows what it is. 
The [fn](https://github.com/fnproject) project is a nice approach.
I don't think that would work. Because * the community would rather circlejerk Guido (and maybe Hettinger) * the core devs would rather circlejerk Guido I say the latter because if there honestly was so much objection to 572 by them (which disclaimer, I like PEP 572), they could have already overthrown him by resigning and forking, yet they didn't.

With respect, type checking in Python does not boost performance unless you were checking types at the application level with `isinstance`/`issubclass`/`type` calls repeatedly. Mypy does not do any optimization, only static analysis.
This is one of my pet peeves. The newsletter/release notes should state what it is, e.g. an elevator pitch.
It also supports dependency management and publishing.
I am not saying it does, I am saying it _CAN_. Once you get a large piece of your codebase statically typed, it would enable things like PyPy or even the default compiler to do optimizations. They do not do this now because lots of codebases are not statically typed. Chicken / egg problem.
But tsplot has gone. Had to write my own function to plot a confidence interval from a series of line plots.
PyPy does not do static optimisation either, as a note. And sure they *can*. Lots of things *can* happen. Your wording made it seem as if it was now. &gt; They do not do this now because lots of codebases are not statically typed. This does not make sense. IIRC Rust, while static, has the ability to be used dynamically quite well, and some people in fact do so. But of course they don't optimize for it. Your statement is akin to a prophecy of "in the future, most codebases will be statically typed, and the Python core devs will turn it into a statically typed language".
Maybe you can try selenium :)
Figuring out how to properly put a django rest framework and vuejs project in appengine.
Just a rundown: Seaborn is a plotting library built off of matplotlib (another plotting library) with a lot of handy functions to make it easier to visualize stuff. Matplotlib is awesome but it requires more lines of code and fiddling to get it working (but much more customizable). If you're into analytics / data science for python you should definitely check it out.
Maybe not your browser history, but your browsing history (while using a google account). Just a guess.

Yeah it does a lot of things, I just couldn't fully elaborate. It does a lot, and bar time, it is to an extent a "one and all solution" that doesn't seem to need more competing standards.
They are gambling that python 3.x might be no longer supported by 2100. That puts a lot of pressure on the python 4.x developers.
Hello there Chris, thanks for the quick reply :-) They are indeed running independently. There's another CI process that deploys the micro-services and handle version dependencies. &gt; The more complicated your dependency/test matrix, the more inclined I’d be to using the setup.py It's not very complex. Because we always try not to break contracts between services. So technically Micro-services X version 1 and micro-server X version 1.4 should work the same (minus new features). But anyhow - wouldn't it be a bit pain to handle a test matrix by `setup.py` version? because you have to keep track somewhere that Test package 1.2 works with Microservice X version 1, and micro-services Y version 2. &gt; but it gives you maximal flexibility for how to build and manage conditional dependencies in your CI environment So you will be deploying the micro-services on the CI environment based on setup.py code upon package installation? &gt;I’m not sure why your setup.py approach requires you to wrap your integration tests in a CLI. Because my `pytests` tests are being deployed as part of a package, they will reside in the package directory. Now, I change my directory into where the package was installed (site-packages/virtualenv) and run them using `pytest`. But this feels a bit hacky isn't it? what I meant is that the test package will come with a dedicated CLI command called `run_tests` for example that will call `PyTest` and run the tests from within the package content - so the CI/user won't have to manually search for the package directory. Hopefully it makes more sense now :) Thanks for sharing your experience! Well, the `PyTests` tests will be installed into your virtualenv. Technically, you don't have access to them because they are part of the inner package. I have to write a command line that execute `pytest` in the context of my package and run my in-package tests. What other alternative I have? I can make it a bit hacky by installing the package, change my active dir into where my package was installed, and run tests from within it using pytest directly. Or there i

Following on what /u/kaihatsusha said, high levels languages can make it very easy to write code that moves slower than molasses. For example, let's say you are processing a very large file and need to break it up into blocks (eg mbox files into individual emails). A brute force approach like block = "" with open("my_emails.mbox") as my_file: for line in my_file: #Do some checks if new_email: #eg line[0:5] == "From " yield block block = "" block += line Beneath the high level language veneer, the interpreter is allocating memory for `line` but when you do `block += line` it is also allocating a new `block` that is sizeof(block) + sizeof(len) for each new line and copying the contents of the old `block` into the new one. Oversimplifying, imagine having a piece of paper with notes and every time you need to write down a new line that you must copy the entire paper onto a new piece of paper. Inversely block = [] with open("my_emails.mbox") as my_file: for line in my_file: #Do some checks if new_email: #eg line[0:5] == "From " yield block block = [] block.append(line) is a couple order of magnitudes faster because each new `line` is just saved in memory with minimal overhead by the interpreter. 
Not even close. PyCharm &gt; IntelliJ &gt; VS Code &gt; everything else
This sounds similar to what I’m doing at my company, but I’m using Flask. I just built the apps and run it on another computer on the network. The users (a small team of about 5) can just open a browser and type in the IP address of the computer and use it that way. It’s not accessible from outside of the network. I’m almost positive you could do the same with Django.
Why not create an API using Django and a rich client using pyqt5? The rich client would then talk to the API. You would also be prepared to create a web app easily if needed.
Thanks; as it turns out I did know about this one - I was (legitimately) thanking the OP for posting the purpose of the library in the title along with the update. So many don't.
From what I gather, it's matplotlib with sane defaults. Still need to mess with the underlying matplotlib stuff at times.

This is the first I've heard of reCaptcha using your history. At your wording implies a pretty in-depth knowledge of your history(e.g. local browser history inspection). You commented further down about it possibly using your signed in google account, but you can see in OP they're using edge(?). AFAIK reCaptcha uses your recent behavior(e.g. mouse movements) on the page to determine if you're likely a bot or human. Likely humans get the single click, everything else gets the complicated stuff. I'm sure they've got a ton of other little checks that they've tested and not disclosed though. [It also depends on the site's security settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39509664).
reCaptcha can be configured to have different levels of difficulty. So you can set it to be really lenient as to not annoy users which is probably what this tutorial page does.
Absolutely this... just because the wire to your house can run at (max) of 10mbps does not mean that everything beyond that (i.e. the stuff in your ISP's cabinets, the peering partner they are using for this route, etc.) isn't oversubscribed or congested below that level. I am currently seeing ~650mbits on the same url from the DC metro area an FiOS gigabit. But again, that is meaningless because our traffic likely took completely different routes.

could also have been one of those "did someone hack PyPI again?!"
nah it's worse, the internet will create lolipip
It does add some handy utilities for color schemes, figure sizing etc, but that's not far from everything. It has a lot of tools for making specialty plots that are useful for statistical analysis (e.g., I use [this one](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.jointplot.html) a lot) as well as integrating with Pandas.
Almost all of these questions could be answer with a quick google search, or searching this subreddit. But I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt: Python is good and one of the most popular languages of late. Python can do web development alongside CSS/HTML/JavaScript. In the long run, it’s good to start training yourself to google questions first as that is the way of the programmer!
Definitely happy about scatterplot. Won't have to wrap `plt.plot` in little loops anymore.
I'm a beginning python programmer and Python is a really easy language that can do a whole lot, including program websites. So far I've been using https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_ this playlist of python 3.4 tutorials to learn most important fundamentals of python.
What does it say when it crashes? Can you post the first couple rows of the CSV file?
Matplotlib defaults are much better in 2.0 but seaborn still provides more advanced plots conveniently.
Points for being compassionate and responding to this question with class and respect. Have an up vote fellow global citizen. 
Well the way I see it is that you try to tack too much more onto Python and it will become a kludge. We can already get massive performance increase with languages like RUST and SWIFT. At the same time we are getting performance increases we are getting modern techniques for things like exception handling, parallelism and other software developments. 
I feel like this is covered pretty well elsewhere. However, it looks like you're using this blog as a platform for showing what you're learning. In that case, you should write up an example using `requests-html`'s Javascript parsing next! 
[https://pythonprogramming.net/](https://pythonprogramming.net/) Click on what you'd like, and most likely python can deliver!
Just released a **0.4.0** on github/pypi, which should work on windows, linux (and perhaps mac) ... can use uvloop if present, and async rpc call for long call
I agree, though unless something has changed, I would prefer to classify Seaborn as "matplotlib wrapper viz. library)"
Thank you. Noting it down. I shall cover it.
I am trying to write this on my own but with extra option to choose video resolution.I can list all the video choices with yt.streams.all() but i can't pull the resolution out of this info. Any ideas? 
I have a similar application where I use a csv file a quasi database; maybe this should work for you to: https://www.github.com/royalmustard/pork Check the Description.py in the object folder
I got the second edition of Flask Web Development a while ago, I've started digging into that.
Have you tried a brute force loop and check if the row contains the words your looking for?
No I haven’t tried that method - I’m relatively new to Python. Thanks for the tip. 
Nice, I’ll look into it and see if it can help me. 
LOL this was going to be my answer. Is it possible? Of course. Is it practical? Probably not.
`map(lambda f: f(line), [f1, f2, f3])` is just what you want, mapping a list of functions to their values at a specific point (`line`).
If not any(fn(line) for fn in filters): continue
Its a good language in **so many** problem domains. Just pick a problem you are interested in solving and go at it. I have to say I learned a ton by making sure to run my code through flake8/pep8 in addition whatever reading I was doing about "pythonic" code.
Thank you very much for the response and not just saying LMGTFY. I will start learning the language today. I was learning Ruby on Rails and got to a point where my computer wouldn't let me continue without downgrading to OS X 10.13 (Im running beta OS X Mojave, I knew I would run into issues.) An issue with Heroku, still googling for the answer. Again thank you very much. 
Link isnt working. 
Probably would've been my first thought
This is probably better isn't it?
That's extremely interesting. I expected the logic to be much harder to follow.
How does this compare to something like plot.ly?
Whatever you find is easiest to read.
Plt.scatter? Plt.plot(x,y,'o')? A loop will create a lot of artists and make big output files and slow plotting times...
What you have here is python3 code. Ask the same question on stackoverflow for a better answer and be sure to give a bit of context.
Thanks! I will check this out, hopefully I can figure out how to make it work for chrome.

You sure that's true? Your instructions or tutorial just be broken. Of course, not enough information here, and it's out of scope of this subreddit.
To make it even more explicit, Python is complimentary to CSS/HTML/JavaScript (unless considering server-side JS). Do not compare *server-side* and *client-side* logic. Perhaps before asking this kind of question (or in any other such exercise), you should figure out in general how the web works. It'll do you more good on the long run.
I don't want to go into detail as you stated this for python, not RoR, html or css. I will keep trying to problem solve it. Need to anyway. 
No more impractical than using any other language. It's not exactly germane to the question, unless you are talking about doing a SIP client at all. There are both high-level and low-level Python bindings: - SIP: pjsip, probably others too - RTP, etc.: libav, gstreamer
Exactly. If you're asking this kind of question, you have serious higher level understanding issues of SIP. Focus on those first rather than asking such questions.

Hi there I'm pretty sure you tried to convey excitement and want to thanks the author for what they have done on their free time, and all they are giving back to the community. It seem though that on other social media platform this phrasing may be seen a negative comment and that open source maintainers should have done that earlier, that they owe us those libraries. This also can look like you are complaining about matplotlib which is a necessary infrastructure into which a lot of work goes. I'm pretty sure that was not your intent, and that you are grateful about all that was done by all the maintainers of open source software, in which case a clarification of your intent could mean a lot to the maintainers. As a reminder for anyone looking, those libraries are provided for free, often developed by volunteer on their free time, and if you think things are not good enough, you are welcome to contribute time (to help with code, issue, documentation, respond to questions...), and/or give to nonprofit like NumFOCUS (https://www.numfocus.org/) which try to make these libraries sustainable. You can do so both as individual, or better try to convince your employer to become a sponsor. Thanks, 
Same question. I think Seaborn is more popular, but I don't know if plotly is better since it's newer.
They switched to pytest :D
I know python, JavaScript, c, assembly, ruby and MATLAB, and I can tell you that python is the easiest, most fun and easiest to learn from all of the above. Everytime I think of a program I would like to have for myself, I can do it in python (I know it for 2 years now). Examples? - I made a bot to play travian for me - using selenium; - I made a bot to send job applications for me - using selenium; - I made script to download the entire discography of an artistist - using pytube; - (little bonus from the above)) I made a script to generate random music lyrics based on the discography lyrics - using Markov chains; The list goes on and on. It's all up to your curiosity and interest on the things you do. As a rule of thumb, there is (almost) always someone who has done something similar to what you have done. Often, there are entire libraries for it. Good luck mate, hope you enjoy the language and the experience as much as I do.
You are probably over thinking this. Given you have this, I expect you are familiar with adjacency matrices, or are taking a graph theory course. There is an adjacency dictionary that holds the full set of notes in your graph as keys. The values in the dictionary are all nodes where an edge from the node to other nodes. Everything before the name == "main" is your program, where all the "stuff" happens. For example pulling the corresponding value from a given key, and returning a list of the connecting nodes. Everything after the name == "main" are ways to interact with the program in the command line.
Check pytube docs 
One thing worth adding that I did not know when I was a total noob. When people say python works for web development, they are referring to the server side. You always need (at least) html. JavaScript is always necessary in any real application. If you want to learn programming for web development, learn html and JavaScript first. If you want a multi purpose language who enables you to do almost anything you can imagine, go for python.
My coworkers are using versions of pip from 6 years ago. I can't tell the difference. Most people don't use the fancy new features of pip.
Not a loop over points (that would be silly) but a loop over categorical variables. Say you have three columns in a table: Day, Cash, Individual And you have something like 5 individuals. You want to plot 5 time-series, one for each individual. You can't feed the individual names into the 'c' argument for plt.scatter. So instead, usually I'll do this: plt.figure() for ind in data.Individual.unique(): ii = data.index[data.Individual == ind] plt.plot(data.Day[ii], data.Cash[ii], 'o', label = ind) plt.legend() 
I sent OP this code a few days ago in response to a "challenge" posted a few days back on r/Python. The post seems to have been deleted after comments pointed out that it was most likely homework (OP said he/she was a "mentor" and did not need help solving it). * https://bpaste.net/show/d3bf71dc261e The code simply modifies an example from the following link but OP removed it from the docstring I provided in the original code: * https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/ Helpful resource on graphs: * https://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Graphs/toctree.html 
What's the use of this? 
Drop us a note https://github.com/wemake-services
I know that there is a lot of repos containing boilerplate code based on [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) , but I don’t know if there’s one specifically for game structure. 
Thanks for the link, it doesn't necessarily have to be for a game. I have work projects too that I just dont know how to organize file-wise. I'm really just looking for a rule of thumb of when to create a new file for a set of code, if there is one at all. 
Just about to do the same. What's cookie cutter??
What's your firm doing that's non-standard? There's a lot of tools to do this already, some of which are even free.
I've been loving the integration with plot.ly and the Dash web framework. But I'm open to other, perhaps more pure pythonic options. 
Totally different packages. Seaborn is a wrapper around matplotlib that helps you make a set of common plot types quickly, while plot.ly is for making interactive plots with JavaScript (all called from within Python - or another language). 
Very good info. Thank you. That's what I was looking for in an answer Python being server side a not front end webpage. I will pursue learning Python. And see what I can make. 
Normally I only want to encourage new users, but this is a rare case where I'd offer a strong word of caution. Being a mac user, you'll want to be very careful about any instructions you see about installing python and python packages. Pay close attention to any mentions of operating system (or lack thereof). It hurts to say, but package management for python is pretty terrible and that goes double on osx. You can make a confusing mess, real fast. 
I work at Odoo, and you can design new apps or use existing ones for that kind of things :) https://www.odoo.com/documentation for tutos &amp; GitHub.com/odoo/odoo for the code :) We've got a growing community with lots of 3rd party modules, a lot of them open source 😄
Like the possibility of corrupting OSX type issues? 
Are you trying to run the interactive mode (the REPL)? Or a program? For the REPL and CLI programs you need to run `python.exe` to launch a command line windows as well. For GUI programs that do not need a command line window use `pythonw.exe`. These programs are usually associated with .py and .pyw files respectively. 
I think you're trying to be positive here, but I'd like to highlight how much negativity you are (I think unintentionally) conveying in this message. These are all open, community-driven projects. They aren't maintained or managed by people being paid to do so, they're run largely by volunteers. If you have a disagreement with functionality that's in one of these packages, I encourage you to learn a bit about how the code works, and implement a patch or new feature. Many communities are very open to improvements. If you think that an API should be different, please voice your opinion in a constructive manner, that's why projects like seaborn use public github issue trackers. However, please consider the tone you take when discussing these projects in public. They wouldn't exist without a lot of unappreciated labor, and they only survive because we cultivate a healthy community of contributors. Critical comments are always welcome, but please keep them constructive. Otherwise we risk harming the contributor community that is so crucial for this ecosystem to thrive.
Always super excited to post my projects here as I always get meaningful feedback that helps me improve. Hope to get some feedback so I can sharpen up my skills!
I was trying to run IDLE. I have used a windows CMD.exe shell to run the CLI program (it appears that my cygwin installation has a messed up $PATH)
seaborn uses matplotlib internally.

Seaborn - based on matplotlib, easier to use but not as flexible, looks good without much extra work. matplotlib - what almost every python plotting library is based on. low-level and harder to use - but very flexible if you know what you are doing. Other than that, check out Vega/Vega-lite and altair which has a different approach to plotting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms29ZPUKxbU&amp;t=4215s
It can get that bad. Yes. 
Thanks - I did. 
I'll check you out - thanks.

The border width was dropped to 1 for all buttons, text boxes, etc. It's a 'flatter' look. Also shows the 2 new elements, `slider` and `listbox`. Also changed the default button color to a dark blue.
I recently made a bot for a game with python and i used pynput to control the keyboard and mouse, cv2 to capture images of the screen and pytesseract to read text from those images. You can probably use something along those lines aswell. But it would probably be way easier to just use javascript if its a simple website.
This looks to have promise! Thanks for the response.
I feel like I should be somewhat scared now. I don't want to follow a tutorial that will possibly corrupt my system. 
Wow, you use Yandex! Why not Google though?
Honestly, Yandex was easier to set up in terms of the API key and I wanted to try something different. I think Google may have a few more languages — that may be the only pro. I will likely end up switching to Google Translate. 🤣

You should totally ask for a refund.
High Performance Python (Osvald / Gorelik) is a good book that talks in detail about how to get the most out of your hardware, and talks specifically about how to make the most of multicore processing.
You won't corrupt your system getting started. If you jump in and make a real mess it's possible to cause system problems later trying to clean it up. 
Finally they got the gcd and lcm!
Ahh, okay - I think I see what you’re going for. From what you describe, I don’t really see the `setup.py` approach as giving you huge benefits because your microservices are running independently from your integration test suite. In that situation, you would basically need to deploy multiple versions of your microservices and configure a CI build job based on environment variables to say “run integration tests against microservice A version X located at Y”. Since you can expect your microservices to be running in their own environments for your integration tests, this is probably the easiest way to do it: 1. Write your integration tests in their own dedicated Git repository. Let’s call it `integration_tests` for the sake of simplicity. 2. Using standard PyTest form, put your integration tests in `&lt;repo-root&gt;/tests/`. In those test scripts, create your fixtures, import dependencies, etc. as you would normally. 2. In `&lt;repo-root&gt;/integration_tests/__init__.py` have a blank file. It won’t really get called or do anything - it’s just a placeholder that ensures PyTest works properly and can navigate up to discover your test scripts. 3. In your CI pipeline, clone your “integration_tests” repo. 4. `cd &lt;cloned-repo-root&gt;/` 5. Run PyTest from the command line like you would normally. Really straightforward. If, however, you *do* need to install microservices (or different versions of microservices) as dependencies for your integration tests, then the `setup.py` route may be easier: Use `package_data` or related manifest/`setup.py` options to pip install with your `./tests/` folder. I would probably recommend pip installing from a private PyPI repo for the sake of simplicity. Using `extras_require` in your `setup.py` file, you can define which set of microservice dependencies get installed when you pip install your integration test repo with a specific tag, and have each CI build job pip install a different set of microservice dependencies based on your CI pipeline configuration. Then when the dependencies have been installed for a given build job, run PyTest from the command-line as you normally would. Hope this helps! Chris
tsplot was absolutely glorious. I'm going to miss it
My only complaint with the update logs is that they don't have any graphics. It'd be neat to have an example for the changes so we can see what was done :)
PyPy and ctypes are different animals. PyPy makes python super fast by using JIT, but C will always be natively faster. You can still use both together. 
People still use Perl 5. It's still dead.
I doubt that. Do you really want the job? It's unpaid. I'm sure a co BDFL would be fine.
You can run many ffmpeg processes in parallel, thus making good use of multiple cores. Honestly, it should be straightforward to maximise the available CPU. The trickier parts of the system will probably turn out to be managing resources. If 1000 requests turn up at once, your multi core box may still struggle processing video, so you may want to think about a queueing system. Flow control is also something to watch out for. If data is coming in faster than you can process it, you may end up buffering too much and running out of RAM. Aiohttp would be a good choice of technology. As would tornado. Both have good websocket support. But you won't be able to use wsgi, as it wasn't designed with websockets in mind. My advice would be to build the simplest thing that works, and iterate fast until you find the bottlenecks in the system...
Finally! I like that \`printoptions\` is a context manager now.
Use Anaconda.
And finally, button images! [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43103559-851cb2c8-8e9c-11e8-9b26-3b90e3b29d0d.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43103559-851cb2c8-8e9c-11e8-9b26-3b90e3b29d0d.jpg) This is the interface for a specialize MIDI file player. The bottom portion is for looping sections of the song so I can slow it down and learn how to play the song on the piano. The important part isn't the layout of this particular form... it's that there are button images at all. I haven't seen a feature like this in any of the EasyGUI type of variants. Coming in release 2.4, as soon as more testing can be completed.
&gt; NumPy 1.17 will drop support for Python 2.7. 
We went with a Jupyter + our libs Docker image, and git to download the notebook itself. 
https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django I have since spoken to the creator and he said it isn't for beginners but rather for somebody with enough experiencing using django to want to implement other apps.

sent you a PM. i'll definitely check it out again when you get it fixed!
While they sometimes do make Python code more readable (by allowing you not to encode the type in the variable name, for example), it's not their primary purpose. They were added to facilitate static code analysis by tools like mypy and IDEs. They are, in my opinion, doing it reasonably well. Earlier, projects you're complaining about would've creatively misused comments or docstrings for the same purpose, and their style guides would describe how to write comments so they can be understood by their analysis tools. This is hardly better.
Thanks a lot. Fixed. :)

Are you extracting data from the sheet, or writing to it? I've used [this library](https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheets) in the past for at least extracting data. It looks like it has bulk write capabilities.

Read the PEP 540: UTF-8 cannot be the default in all cases. But the UTF-8 is enabled automatically for the C locale. Getting UTF-8 instead of ASCII in that case already fix a *lot* of use case without having to touch your code, just upgrade to Python 3.7.
Thank you ;-) Thanks to INADA Naoki who approved my PEP and Nick Coghlan who implemented C locale coercion which also helps.
where's julia?
Look in the toolz library, especially the pipeline function. Does exactly what you want. 
Seconding pygsheets...very easy to use!
Nope. That's the only difference. 
You can check humble bundle you can get it plus others for about 2 bucks or more if you wanna pay more
oh. lmao
Very curious how quickly a university will backport.
Also...why or when would you want to do one way over the other?
In addition to what other's have said, I would like to add that the added flexibility (and complexity) of matplotlib makes it a better choice for publication quality figures. This is because you have direct access to what seaborn hides from you for simplicity and ease of use. When I am ready to make the final plots for my publication I switch to matplotlib so that I can fine tune everything and get the figures looking exactly how I want then.
Funny, too bad you're getting downvoted. Nine years's before Guido's retirement, the following was posted as an April Fools joke: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/) Excerpt: &gt;Guido wrote the original implementation of Python in 1989, and after nearly 20 years of leading the community, has decided to step aside as its Benevolent Dictator For Life. His official title is now Benevolent Dictator Emeritus Vacationing Indefinitely from the Language (BDEVIL). Guido leaves Python in the good hands of its new leader and its vibrant community, in order to train for his lifelong dream of climbing Mount Everest. &gt; &gt;After unanimous vote of the Python Steering Union (not to be confused with the Python Secret Underground, which emphatically does not exist) at the 2009 Python Conference ([PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/) [\[7\]](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/#id13) 2009), Guido's successor has been chosen: Barry Warsaw, or as he is affectionately known, Uncle Barry. Uncle Barry's official title is Friendly Language Uncle For Life (FLUFL).
One thing holding me back from using plotly is that cufflinks dont work with version 3.0 yet. Cufflinks allows you to plot directly from pandas dataframe.
To make your code shorter, also it may help you solve name conflicts 
Haha, yeah... This one was even complete with PUBG/Fortnite references (**P**atient, **U**nderstanding, **B**enevolent **G**overnor), mocking the Twitter polls, and the return of the Python Secret Underground (which emphatically does NOT exist, but would be returning if it did). 
It would be a great addition to the docs if there was a section of real life examples with what their architecture specs should be and what the output is from the tool. Especially if that example is some random 3rd OSS package and doesn't have a perfect architecture. That would really display the usefulness of the tool. 
You can still see the old praw.ini (with all the info) in the commit history. For a toy project like this, it probably doesn't matter, but it's good practice to cancel that key, if you haven't already.
At the opcode level the latter is less efficient. But that's like saying some snails are faster than small slugs. If you somehow have thousands upon thousands of imports like this, or this is a repeating cron job, you will eventually notice though.
I'd much rather just use my IDE's Refactor&gt;Rename capabilities
The wound is still open you bastar 
Not what you asked for, but I learned a lot very quickly from sqlzoo.net. It'sa an interactive tutorial, where you type in changes to a default SQL query string. I recomend trying it.
Those three new plot types are fantastic IMO. Very intuitive to use and beautiful as well (ok, seaborn was very beautiful already, but the point still stands...)
Which concerningly currently has a significant bug wrt numpy usage. 
Using "import as" can also be useful for using the. Same library in different python version, which sometimes have different names.
That's a job for undergrads :)
The latter is less idiomatic. Some things (eg hiding import blocks in PyCharm) won't work with the former and some people may be confused by it, but for most practical purposes the differences are negligible.
Here are the related release: notes https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/ &gt;Switch to a Calendar based versioning scheme
Thanks!

After two month really? (I had to get into it again 😉) I read the PEP and haven't seen anything that stand against my claim - besides backward compatibility with the Python 3 series. And exactly the latter *isn't* contradict to my posting as I have written about what Python 3 *should have had*! If there are problems *nowadays* they simply show the *falsinesss* of the decision to rely on the shitty locale depending implicitly default encoding. Imho funny that precisely Java and C# both nowadays have allready changed their mistakes - and especially the former is to be known really slow at introducing backward compatibility breaking changes... But probably I have not gathered the aspect you wanted to emphasize by getting this PEP into the discussion? Then please cite the relevant passages here. 
Built in options would be threads and multiprocessing. There may be something better using python 3 though (I only recently switched so I'm not sure). You can start the threads and processes one time, then continually feed them data. You won't have to kill them and restart them. It should be faster than what you're currently doing. If you're worried about time, you'll have to to time it.

Check out some code I wrote for similar usecase. global final_failed_searches final_failed_searches = [] global final_businesses final_businesses = [] # input_data = 'yelp_data.json' input_dir = 'data_sources/chunked_data' output_dir = 'results/chunked_results' with open(input_dir + '/intput' +chunk_index +'.json', 'r') as f: data = json.load(f) threads = [] for i,chunk in enumerate(chunks(data,8)): t = Thread(target = get_business_data_wrapper, args = [chunk, final_businesses, final_failed_searches]) print ('starting thread '+str(i)) t.start() threads.append(t) print ('thread '+str(i) + ' added to threadlist') for t in threads: t.join() print ('threads joined') with open(output_dir + '/' +'output_' + str(chunk_index) +'.json','wb') as valid_fp: json.dump(final_businesses,valid_fp,indent=4) with open(output_dir+'/failed_searches' + str(chunk_index) +'.json','wb') as error_fp: json.dump(final_failed_searches,error_fp,indent=4) 
1.17... a few months later after official. 1.18... have hearted port with significant regressions. 1.18.1... "coming soon" forever.
Wait what bug?

Cool visuals. You can scrape stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the Python package, yahoo\_fin. You won't be restricted to 100 days, and shouldn't have the dividend issue mentioned in the article. Here's an example: import yahoo\_fin.stock\_info as si \# get Dow tickers as list tickers = si.tickers\_dow() \# pull historical price data for each Dow stock dow\_prices = {ticker : si.get\_data(ticker) for ticker in tickers} Here's the documentation: [http://theautomatic.net/yahoo\_fin-documentation/](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/)
Does bokeh compete in the same space as seaborn?
Honestly, I disagree. I can't imagine the Py2 removed code is much more than some boilerplate.
Sure!
Hey /r/Python I am new to python so I apologize if this code is assaulting anyone's eyes. I am using IEX to pull stock tickers. However, using the "get_available_symbols()" function from IEX pulls up cryptos as well as stocks. Stocks have a "type" of "cs". Ultimately, I just want a list of symbols with type cs so I am trying to make a dictionary of the 2 lists so I can then sort that dictionary. Thank you for the help!
Good, I hope not.
Here is the code from iexfinance import Stock import pandas as pd import numpy as np from iexfinance import get_available_symbols data = get_available_symbols() syms = [item["symbol"] for item in data] tyms = [item["type"] for item in data] df1 = pd.DataFrame(syms, columns=["symbol"]) df2 = pd.DataFrame(tyms, columns=["type"]) #df = pd.DataFrame({'symbol':[syms],'type':[tyms]}) df3 = df1.values.T.tolist() df4 = df2.values.T.tolist() df5 = tuple(df3) dictionary = dict(zip(df4, df5)) print(dictionary) 
from iexfinance import Stock import pandas as pd import numpy as np from iexfinance import get_available_symbols data = get_available_symbols() syms = [item["symbol"] for item in data] tyms = [item["type"] for item in data] df1 = pd.DataFrame(syms, columns=["symbol"]) df2 = pd.DataFrame(tyms, columns=["type"]) #df = pd.DataFrame({'symbol':[syms],'type':[tyms]}) df3 = df1.values.T.tolist() df4 = df2.values.T.tolist() df5 = tuple(df3) dictionary = dict(zip(df4, df5)) print(dictionary) 
It gets harder and harder. It'll be a lot easier to just upgrade to Python 3 at some point.
I thought all the cool kids were smoking Conda these days, and poetry was what they thought they were writing instead of code...
Doubt that point will be anytime soom for universities, unfortunately.
Hi I wanted to make some improvements and pull requests and need to know what string quote type you want to stick with(single/double) for consistency as I see both being used. I prefer single quote because it's easier to type and double quotes are better to represent typed text or someone speaking, but it's up to you.
- Python3-only syntax such as keyword-only arguments. This is a big part of the Matplotlib3 diff, and makes backporting very labor-intensive - Compilation changes and the C-API are a big deal for Numpy I can imagine that some users backport a specific new feature they want onto the Numpy LTS with 2.7 support, but I seriously doubt that anyone will ever produce a full backport of 1.17 to Python 2.
What is your web site?
Maybe try using `asyncio` in Python 3. [Here's a good comment on feedparser's GitHub.](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/issues/111#issuecomment-357478078) Doing it this way would be blazing fast.

I don't know kivy, but python standard library can't call a method in another thread. What you need to do is signal the other thread and have it watch for signals and respond.
that is incredibly close
It’s probably easier to do your data manipulation in pandas than pure Python - that’s what pandas was built for and why the IEX API you’re using returns a DataFrame instead of a dict of lists. Read up on pandas and think carefully about what you’re trying to do. Once you’ve made a little progress, post a minimal working example (instead of your code dump below). 
I am scared
* can be quite easily simulated via decorators. Not to mention making this change 1.15--&gt;1.17 would be ridiculous. That's breaking a lot of backwards compatibility in minor versions. * they definitely are. But I am pretty sure most of the "python 2 specific" C code is just the boiler plate to expose things as Python functions/classes in c extension modules. I'll take this bet, because I unfortunately have gotten word that a project I am on that uses numpy heavily will not be ported to Py3 for at least another 3 years. So it seems I might have to make the port myself and fork starting from 1.16.
It's worse than that. numpy is not pure Python; it is built on extension modules. The C-API between Py2 and Py3 differ more than Python code, and both have a lot of undocumented or poorly documented surprises and gotchas. Oh... then you have to remember there are two Py2 ABIs depending whether `--enable-unicode=ucs2` or `4`.
In your very first example, you use the python 2 style `print` statement but it’s clear you’re using python 3, where print is a function. The error message shown has nothing to do with the issue you’re trying to demonstrate either - the correct error would have been `TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment` I haven’t read the rest, I would suggest proofing your content first. 
Congratulations on completing your project! There are some areas for improvement that I noticed. Since you've got the logic down it's definitely worth your while to *refactor* your duplicate code into functions. For example, you currently have each "difficulty" as its own function. The code that gets the input and mages the game state is duplicated across all of the difficulties. Firstly, what if instead of duplicating this block while(continuePlaying): try: choice = int(input("0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors, 5: exit \n")) except ValueError: print("you must enter an integer \n") if((choice &gt; 2 or choice &lt; 0) and choice != 5): print ("You must enter an integer less than three and greater than or equal to 0 or choose 5 to exit. \n") while((choice &gt; 2 or choice &lt; 0) and choice != 5): print ("You must enter an integer less than three and greater than or equal to 0 or choose 5 to exit.\n") try: choice = int(input("0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors \n")) except ValueError: print("you must enter an integer \n") make a function called something like `getUserMove()` that does everything that that block does but you only have to write it in one place. The advantage of doing this is that when you want to make a change to the way the program asks for user input you only have to change one part of the code. This if (won &lt; 0): won = 0 can be replaced with `won = max(won,0)` and is also more clear. If you deduplicate your code you'll likely end up with 1/4 as much code. A massive improvement!

It looks like it was just a typo and they forgot the parenthesis. It's fine everywhere else though. 
As it happens, the fancy features of pip are often not new, and actually are very important. There is something to what you say, but there's a very different emotional attitude: yes, a lot of Python "programmers" work on trivial Django projects, which depend on a handful of equally popular libraries that live on pypi.org. Everything works smoothly because all these popular projects polish their version conflicts through great effort of great many cotton-pickers who manually weed through their bugs and inconsistencies. Now, once you are a more serious company, and you need to run your own pypi server, with your own packages, things start going south very quickly. First thing you'll discover that you absolutely must always run `pip install --process-dependency-links`. If your DevOps used some third-party tool that calls `pip install`, you are up for a pleasant surprise. Next thing you'll realize that Python has at least half a dozen of ways to install a library, all of them defective. This is where `pip` shines by screwing you up at every turn. At some point you'll also realize that using `pip` and virtual environments wastes a lot of time, network bandwidth and disk space... By this time you may be already patching `pip` to fix some other issues with it, and maybe considering writing your own package manager.

Thank you for such a quick response! VPSs look promising. Also should have mentioned I have an old Chromebook collecting dust that I would love to repurpose as some sort of private server, if that’s at all possible. Gotta love how they teach algorithms but not basic servers to comp sci majors!!!
What are you trying to do? CI is still there in `line_plot`...

Meh. Every university I’ve worked at has essentially been BYOD for PhD students and up so we can have whatever Python version we want.
My work with numpy so far has only led me down the floating point path, so I've not had a use for those yet. Out of curiosity: in what kind of work would those functions be useful?
Hi, Looking for a Python programmer who can help generate a script to capture video from am hdmi capture card, then process that video into an edit of sorts, and generate an .mp4 of the edit....

May I suggest trying to use \[Click\]([http://click.pocoo.org/6/](http://click.pocoo.org/6/)) instead of argparse.
In fact not so indispensable for me. However, I learned gcd as a toy example in an introduction to programming class (with C), so I once tried to find if there was a similar function in NumPy already implemented.
p.s: On linux only. It's enabled by AMD's rocm open source stack, which is nice :)
Nice
I would say there is more game theory than AI. 
Yep, 2.0 is so much better that I stopped using seaborn. I rarely need the more advanced plots though.
What works great for me is finding "what to do" and then go from there. For example, once I needed to parse a long text file, find some tokens (specific strings), replace them, zip the modified files and send them by mail. So I set out to learning python and I learnt the Syntax first, then pip (which you use to install other libraries), then string processing, file handling, external commands, etc. Tldr; find something that interest you that you could do with python and do it. 
Baby lick me
This sort of question belongs in /r/learnpython. And when you post there, make sure you post code [formatted for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F).

Done. Thanks for the heads up.
Hey! Thanks for showing interest. Single quotesm and I'll make sure to fix everything that uses doubles quotes.
Your countdown function is run before your while loop starts. That means that it simply finishes and sets game-stop to true. Then your while loop starts and will not end until you press enter 15 times. The countdown function does nothing anymore at this stage.
Refactoring in python is not very fun, in my experience, which may not be the most helpful answer you'll get. But ... if you try to spend a bit more time upfront thinking about it, you'll need to spend less time in the refactoring stage.

Use TDD. It's hard, it's boring and you will find yourself rewriting the same thing 10 times to make it easier to test. With time it becomes a lot simpler and when you review your code a year down the road then you will thank yourself. Granted a big caveat is that the tests can be shit as well hence it takes time to get most out of it. As many other practices, it all takes time and it's boring and it's hard, so you might as well invest time into something that will benefit you in the future.
tbh, that's prolly where he got it! they're too similar!

&gt; Lately I discovered that reading my code several time is not a pleasant experience to me Its not just you dude, everyone hates going through existing code whether written by themselves or anyone else. And that's why there is a popular saying that its 100 times easier to create a new solution from scratch than fix drastically an existing one. Sites like upwork are filled with freelance offers for fixing existing code and the bids run into hundreds of dollars, yet there are very few gigs for greenfield projects. Nobody likes going through someone else's (or even their own) code, hence the high demand.
Thank you JackLeo!

It provides the data of specific locations, countries and cities you've visited so far, as well as how many times and which Instagram posts match the location.
Do you want to install a package thats not included with Ananconda or use conda to install a package? To install Ananconda install the executable To install the individual package can you use pip install or use &gt;&gt; conda install 
Take a good udemy course
\- before you pass your code to someone else to review it, create pull request etc. do review and refactoring by yourself . With that you will not be wasting the time of others doing review for you \- when you do refactoring or check notes from others take advantage of this and put all of this into you habits, this will make you code better next time and in overall you will write more clean code \- you should reviews others code as well, and read all others notes as well because this will make you just better at writing you own code \- try to leave code better that it was before you start making changes, refactoring is common daily routine
Wouldn't that be a major version change? I normally expect minor versions to keep working in my environment.
good to hear that XD
Thank you dikamilo for your answer
Everything on Reddit can be found using a search engine. Including Reddit itself. I guess it's time for the site to shut down.
I'm not talking PhD's though, I mean for Bachelors students in engineering.

I don't care if it's just an assignment. Just because I can untangle it, doesn't mean I want to deal with horseshit other people will be now able to write. People **will** use it to cram the lines of code to the brim with smartass crap, because code golfing is cool and because they can't be bothered to set up their variables in advance. And the potential for abuse in a comprehension is ridiculous, because now, instead of being a dumb syntactic sugar around map() with some filter optionally slapped on top, it will have "memory" between "iterations". 
nothing like that exists as far as I know, but you could make something with sqlalchemy to build table objects and their columns/relationships up. what you will probably find though is that there will be some constraints on the json like needing a type attribute and id attribute for the record. or you have to code an assumption in for something like that. 
`&lt;-` all the way! :-)
Thank you, I will look into it.
celery will probably help here. as far as GUI you would have to build one unless all you need is process information in which case supervisord gives you a web front end so you can start/stop/restart processes and tail their stdout/stderr and all it requires is an ini file.
Only valid to a certain point, in some cases in numpy even minor version upgrades are very worth upgrading.
Errrr the only VFX I and google know are "visual effects" so I have no idea what you mean in this context. And just look at some Autodesk products-- they use IronPython which is basically 2.7 with easy C# lib access (they are working on IronPython3.x but it has been taking forever).
This is weird that it's 4 years old and has literally 48 likes on youtube. Thanks for the (re)post. Super appropriate for where I'm at currently.
