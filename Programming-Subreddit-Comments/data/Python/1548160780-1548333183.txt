Makes sense, thanks for you input!
Well anaconda enables you to keep the system python environment (the one that comes default) separate from the python environments you use to develop, experiment etc... On linux this advantage is quite valuable, the system python is typically used by the OS itself for various tasks/routines... so 'messing' with the system python (e.g. installing that very bleeding-edge experimental version of that library you don't really need but cannot suppress the urge to just download and check out) entails the risk some OS tasks/routines suddenly break... That being said, this advantage cannot also be realized by using venv and the likes... &amp;#x200B; Other advantages (certainly on Windows) is the availability of pre-compiled binaries for a lot of libraries (however, deploying the build toolchain is a lot easier on linux than it is on Windows) and the 'library dependency &amp; version compatibility checks' that comes along with using anaconda...
Being coupled to the python version and library versions supplied with your OS is a major PITA. When you upgrade your OS .... bang, your python app breaks. Or you find you need a version of a library that isn't available because your system version is a bit behind the times. Being independent of the OS python and libs is SO much better. You don't need a full Anaconda install. Miniconda is a minimal version. Then just install what you need into your conda Envs.

I can't understand what i have done wrong ... i am not impersonating anyone
Out of curiosity, why is that? 
Okay i will see to it ... Thanks 
Wouldn't a vemv accomplish the same thing though?
That’s fantastic! I wanted to get one of these to program.
I'm guessing he's either a troll or a drunk in the wrong thread.
Or you can use attrs, if you don't need the named tuple's compatible API.
If we could demonstrate if it was accurate, we wouldn't have to ask if it was accurate because we'd be using that perfect data instead.
&gt; I try to learn but I really don’t care much for it’s syntax Honestly as you learn to programme you'll end up learning so many different languages that you're going to experience all the different syntax there is anyway. There's no avoiding it, just getting used to it. There are positives and negatives to each type, too, so you'll learn and appreciate the benefits and learn to avoid the pitfalls of each.
Not only that, but editors can leverage the type hints in order to provide better code completion.
I would say - package them in a git repo (it doesn't have to be public, but why not?) Clone those repos into one place on your system and refer that place with PATH.
C# isn't really much more heavyweight than javascript, and balances its additional complexity with libraries like LINQ that let you do insane data manipulation in very few, very understandable lines. Maybe not the best choice for something super simple where python will always shine, but as soon as you want to do even the most basic level of data manipulation I've found few languages make it simpler.
How's it for data manipulation, specifically thinking in comparison to using LINQ?
If I search for a programming problem I type the name of the language then the problem. So it's more than people just searching the language for interest, it's people searching it in their everyday work.
pycharm already does that, I've been really playing around with it really
You can use LINQ in Python. Several packages making this possible like for example Linq, py_linq, python-linq and quite a number of others. In so far as data manipulation, find Python far easier and quicker than C# when it comes to working with data. Check out (Pandas)[https://pandas.pydata.org/]
Anaconda was an absolute lifesaver back when the Python packaging/distribution state was still a mess and interacted badly with the OS distribution of the same components. It had robust virtual environments way before venv (that's why they behave a bit differently). The situation is much better now so its advantages are not as dramatic. If you are maintaining an environment where users can have either Windows, OSX or Linux as their desktop is definitely helps to keep them all in the same infrastructure.
if you have a requirements.txt file in your project you can automatically install everything it needs by passing that file to pip, which will get them all and give you some easy way to manage your dependencies. Please see the documentation for pip.
It still weights towards languages with large numbers of new users. I can go days without searching for a PHP specific issue. I search for Tensorflow related items daily. This methodology will always weight towards hotness, not usage base. How much it weights is debatable, but it's the majority of the effect IMO.
Pylint at least and I believe flake8 will discourage the use of `%`-formatting by throwing a pile of linter warnings in your face.
The story in the post is about how to reduce memory footprint. Until now, the only way to minimize the allocated memory for an instance of a class was to use `__slots__`. However, if we are dealing with data in which there can be no reference cycles, then we can reduce the amount of allocated memory for the object. And this is exactly what the post and referenced [recordclass library](https://pypi.org/projects/recordclass), in particular, are about.
I know that syntax but for the sake of others I prefer the inline if. I have mixed feelings for non aware syntax on other languages, as well as proposed python syntax.
You should be very careful about using `value or other_value` as a substitute for `value if value is not None else other_value` because truthiness is not a perfect substitute for testing None-ness. Case in point, the substitution will fail if False is a valid possible value. In general, it's bad practice to use a variable's truthiness as a way to test whether it is None, both in terms of introducing bugs and in terms of decreasing code readability and clarity. My advice is to always test for None-ness explicitly with: `value is None.
Yes that really is a nice trick! I personally like using it a lot. But I've heard some good arguments against it because of its ambiguousness. It's easy to make the same assumption as you did before, especially for programmers who come from other languages where `or` is strictly reserved for booleans and conditionals. My personal rule of thumb for the use `x or y` (outside of `if` statements) is that `x` should be of a type that only has *one* value that evaluates to `False`. For example, `x: Optional[int]` is confusing IMO because both `x = 0` and `x = None` result in `y` being used, which can be a pain to understand and debug. Also, `y` should preferably be a constant. But those are just my preferences since I'm a bit obsessed with typing, other devs might have other takes on it.
I might be wrong but pyarmor -e myscript.py -s path_to_myscript.py

I've been organizing my classic cryptography project (just finished an Enigma simulator for it). Now I'm trying to figure out how to turn it into a package/module and if there's a way to make it interactive.
I strongly disagree. This is fine if you're only ever going to run the code on your local machine but that's it. It's just like way back when and you'd include something like `C:\users\kurashu89\images\awesome.png` in a webpage and none of your friends could see it.
This emu guy has been a redditor for 4 hours. No idea what he's going on about.
I’m taking on my first project since learning the python basics: a D&amp;D initiative tracker. It should be a relatively simple program and I am designing it to run in the command line for now but intend on converting it to a GUI based program once I have the foundation down. I’m excited to see what I learn along the way! 
Yeah, it’s been months, and I’m still working on a compiler for my very own C-like programming language. I’ve had some success tho! I’ve got a prototype that supports typing, control flow and functions. I’ve quickly built a VM that can execute the intermediate representation emitted by the compiler and was able to run a ton of stuff written in _my own language_ (which is absolutely bonkers to me): lots of math functions (like sine/cosine via Taylor series) and even recursive functions, which suggests the function call logic may be correct, and this is what I’ve been struggling with for a lot of time. A problem I’m facing now is handling arrays and especially passing them to functions, because my language deliberately doesn’t have pointers (I’ve seen enough bugs and weird issues caused by incorrect usage of pointers, so thank you very much). The most obvious thing is to pass the whole array by value, but that’ll obviously create tons of basically useless copies of the array and will probably make it impossible to modify the array inside the callee. So, I’m trying to think of a way to pass dope vectors (that’s an actual term smh) instead of the actual arrays. Another problem is that the intermediate representation is now basically instructions for the VM, and not three-address-code, so I have no idea how to optimize it, while there are algorithms for optimizing the TAC. So, I might as well throw everything to the trash and start anew (also because my code is a mess, yet it works somehow), emitting proper TAC.

So python OR doesn't use normal truth tables...? Why?
I second this. If you use it with a separate virtual environment for each project, it really helps do away with warring dependencies or needing different versions for different projects.
I'm finishing writing the backend for a small coding challenge / game that I wanted to try and beat, but couldn't find any code out there to support. The game/challenge is: You are given a 2d grid and you have to write code to dictate which cardinal directions to move. Your moves are limited and you want to maximize the number of food you collect. You compete against other's solutions.
Came here to make sure this was posted. Explicit is better than implicit. An empty list might be a valid value, but is truthiness False. Explicit `is None` and `is not None` are needed for many things. The lack of these have caused hard to find bugs. Another way to look at `or` being used in this way is: &gt; I always assumed that x or y returned True or False, depending on the expression. This means MOST of the people reading your code might assume this as well, so it is a shortcut that you probably don't want to do for readability. However, understanding order is important. More so with `and` rather than `or` for something like: if my_obj is not None and my_obj.property &gt; 10: pass If `my_obj` is None, then there is no `.property` to access and the second part would throw and exception. However, since `and` evaluates the left side first, a `None` value would short circuit the evaluation, not running the error producing second part.

\`cd awesome-package &amp;&amp; pip install -e .\`
That's not what he said. Python doesn't require Boolean typed things as a predicate to a condition, be it `if` or other boolean operations such as `or`. And the result isn't necessarily a Boolean type. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = None or 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = False or True &gt;&gt;&gt; b True
There is a `bool` function built into Python. You can execute this on anything an see the truthiness of it. This is what determines the evaluation of the `or`, but the original value is returned as it is reduced. 
Exactly. `value or other_value` is great when you *mean* that *anything empty* should be replaced. def fun(param: Optional[Sequence[Any]] = None): param = param or () for elem in param: ... This works perfectly fine, since replacing `param` with an empty tuple won’t change any part of how the subsequent code works if `param` is an empty sequence. The only difference is that the `or` catches `None`s as well, which is very deliberate here.
&gt; but writing tests first seems like buckling your belt before putting your pants on because... belts are so great and awesome? That's exactly what it is. The very first example given in the book is upper-case T. It starts from a test and works backward to an implementation that satisfies the test case. It's a trivial example but the book builds on it. If you subscribe to the agile (LOWER-CASE A, implying "_agility_", not bullshit-speak Scrum, Extreme, or some other nonsense) philosophy of software development, you may recall the phrases "working software over comprehensive documentation" and "responding to change over following a plan". TDD is tantamount to comprehensive documentation and a rigorous plan, written in a language (i.e., your programming language of choice) that isn't conducive to understanding on a single pass. TDD will have you codify the behavior first, to "the perfect interface", as a comment below put it, before you ever _do_ anything with the software. It's like writing a proof and then working backward to an algorithm. You have some idea what the expected result should be, then you _assume_ that your ideal result accurately describes the end state of the system. What if that was a bad assumption (hint: it probably is, because the one constant in software development is that the software is always changing)? Then before you've ever done any real work, you're committed to rewriting your tests because your behavior _will_ change. It is much more productive to write the _simplest_ implementation to convey _actual functionality_, then _immediately_ test it. It doesn't matter if it's exactly right on the first try (no approach will ever guarantee this anyway) as long as you, or someone who depends on you, can use it and you can iterate on it. You work your way _forward_ to a consistent spec and expected behavior that you can consider stable. Write tests along the way to ensure you don't regress at any point, and also because running a test suite (or a relevant subset of it) is a hell of a lot faster than firing up an application and testing everything by hand. You focus on something you can actually use rather than contriving a machine that satisfies your gleaming ideal. TDD is predicated on the assumption that you know exactly what you want right when you start. I've been hammering on software for 15 years and not _once_ has that ever happened.
I mostly do python web dev, and most of the time I only really care if a value is truthy. This can still be really nice for those cases. For example, populating a class with data from a form. If I have a default value, I can just do something like `instance_var = form.input.data or 'default'`. Testing for None explicitly is definitely something to be concerned about, but there are certainly valid use cases for this.
Also `x and y` will return `x` if it is `None` otherwise `y`. Which may sound weird but it does have some uses.
Ahh. Thanks.

Thank you (:
Thats some awesome info, I really appreciate the guidance. I have a lot to look into but this sets me in the right direction, thank you. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks
This looks awesome! Thanks.
&gt;TDD is predicated on the assumption that you know exactly what you want right when you start. Well said. I look forward to adding testing to me bag of skills, but doing so in a practical and thoughtful way instead of blindly following a methodology. I appreciate the in-depth response!
Absolutely. Imagine this: def sleep(time=None): if not time: time = 10 # default Now it’s impossible to `sleep(0)` because that’s a falsy value.
From the first example, it's very much TDD.
Why would you write that sort of statement in the first place?
Thanks! I did consider the difference between None and a false statement. As far as I can see, it has no implications on my code yet, so I didn't see it as such a big thing.

I think another way that is more readable is: `new _value = value if value else other_value`

No, it's that the `or` operator uses Python's typecasting to typecast its operands into boolean values to work out its result, and then it returns normal value of the first "true" value it finds. `5 or 3` doesn't return `True`, it returns `3`. In even greater depth Python is member of languages that uses [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) as a small optimization.
Funny trick about that, you can write if expression: a = value like that: a = expression and value
That makes more sense. The short circuit is new to me.
So what’s the solution? You explained a problem but no solution. I once heard: “it’s not a problem if there isn’t a solution.”
Trying to resist the siren calls of cool libraries like dash and Gooey so that I can focus my efforts on trying to understand how to best work with datetime objects in my cli application. 
Isn't less ambiguous to use something like a nested "if"?
&gt; code readability Nailed it. I hate when co-workers brag about the sick one liner that's unreadable when it could have been readable over 3.
While I see its purpose, I have never been a huge fan of truthiness in some cases; especially with `None`. There are times it makes sense but if you have a keyword argument default to `None` and it gets a zero or an empty string, I want to know! I've even had to do things like: `if var is True` because I want to explicitly only accept `True` (though this breaks duck-typing). It is not my *common* practice, but it does happen
I had a nasty bug one time and it turned out I tested `if value` instead of `if value is not None` which an empty string was sneaking through. From that point on I'm explicit with each if.
darn
`or` is generally not a substitute for `if var is None else ...`. But it has its own pattern and is especially nice for when you know that default values are "empty"... int -&gt; 0 bool -&gt; False str -&gt; '' dict -&gt; {} list -&gt; [] etc. This pattern I see more often now with type annotations where as previously, None was the default standard for "empty". That said, you probably want to still be careful with containers because if you do not pass in a new container through the API call, you will find yourself updating the old one.
Hello everyone! At the moment I am working with a partner on the pet project "Count Files". This is a CLI written in pure Python. The main purpose of this utility is to count or search for files by extension in a given directory(all files, files with a specific extension, files without an extension). Supported operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS(iPhone/iPad). Source on GitHub: [https://github.com/victordomingos/Count-files](https://github.com/victordomingos/Count-files) The program allows you to choose to include/exclude in the search hidden files and files in hidden folders. At the moment, this option is implemented so that we check every file (path). I want to speed up the processing of files, skipping hidden folders and, accordingly, the files contained in these folders. Tests show that it is more beneficial for Windows than for other operating systems (it is more difficult to check the file attribute on Win). In addition, my partner discovered that recent macOS versions have a local backup feature that uses a special file system that from time to time is mounted on /Volumes/MobileBackups. He offers to ignore this volume when searching for files, consider it hidden. Now the project code as a whole is universal for all operating systems. But due to the issues mentioned above, I think it's time to change the structure of the program so that we can make changes specific to a particular OS. This is what I'm working on this week :)
I think (someone else might weigh in to confirm/deny) you should be using equality if you really want to test explicitly `if var == True`; Booleans are just a special type of numeric type, and it would be wrong to test `if 1000 is 1000`. I think the issue is that the behavior of using `is` to compare numeric types might be compiler dependent, or whatever.
What is easier to do on Linux: 1. Have as many versions of Python as you want, compiled with all kinds of settings, modules and whatnot. (I typically have 5-10 different Pythons, I need Python builds with debugging enabled, for example, and then I also need to go a version or two back, and then some environments require that I use a very specific version and so on). 2. Compiling Python bindings that come as an extra for some native library, and they aren't covered by Anaconda. 3. Working with development versions of libraries, those that aren't yet in the official repositories of Anaconda. Basically, things that matter to you, if you are developing a library / a larger project with complicated setup. But, if infrastructure is a pain for you, and you simply want things to work, w/o having to understand them... Anaconda would be still nice.
this means that i don't have to learn javascript?
Wow that's actually incredibly useful. I've been writing the longhand if for a while return obj and obj.property
That wasn't the only way, that wasn't even the best way. The best way is to write it in C. Python is arguably good for prototyping. If you need speed or space... Python will only get in your way.

This is the better answer than the bracket answer.
It's not the equivalent. It's for getting and setting attributes on an object. Indexing like a list can be done with __getitem__.
(not exclusive)
no
This reminds me that [PEP 505, None-coalescing operators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0505/) is still deferred and, given the events of the last ~6 months, we shouldn't expect it to move anytime soon. If I remember correctly that would add 4 operators: a binary `??` to cover the case in OP in the presence of `None`, an augmented assignment `??=`, a coalescing attribute accessor `?.`, and a coalescing indexer `?[]` I personally don't have enough experience to know what kind of impact that would have on the language. It feels like too much. I try to remove checks for None in some other way when they start to look excessive.
Furthermore, you can have really confusing bugs with nested empty collections evaluating to true. This can get messy, fast. For this and other reasons, I've taken to writing a small helper system I call defaults. It has the added sometimes-benefit of defining all arg defaults at the top of the module. In the function itself, you just call arg = Default.cast(arg)

this worked really well for a large csv. https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/pgfutter
Learn what you use. Use what you learn. In terms of 3rd party libraries, requests is pretty universal (ignore the built-in urllib); numpy too (pandas and matplotlib too if numpy sparks your interest). Ignore the built-in unittest in favour of pytest.
Honestly, this is a great example of putting clever conciseness over comprehensibility. English speakers don't use the word "or" in this way and it's not idiomatic in Python either. I would avoid it.
I'm very new (today actually) when i comes to python, the filename that it outputs is kind of correct, it just gives me the site-type-date `site-type-2019-01-22` however this should include the .txt on the end Within this file, I'm getting the command - that should be issued on the device - and a time (no date).txt `"show mod 17:08:46.136407.txt"` So the date output is doing something with it thats not correct. When i issue the above script, but removing the date functionality side of it, i get everything i expect
And how often you use sleep(0) again?
Thank you! I'm looking through all of these answers and this was really helpful!
Which, in my code, would be the desired behavior.. 
I agree if you are using type hints prolifically then this is appropriate to do 
Of course. However, the fact is that each instance of a class in Python, a user-defined one, supports cyclic garbage collection. Because of this, three words of memory are added to each instance. And this is needed less often than one can think. Therefore, a factory function is introduced by analogy with namedtuple to generate classes without the support of cyclic garbage collection. Which saves three words.
Sooooo, You sir, managed to solve it pretty accurately. I hadn't printed out my variable to check its output :(, so proceeded to do so and saw you were correct with the colons, quick google later to figure out the formatting and boom. File now outputs to a txt file and the contents are as i expected. 
This is particularly useful where the 2nd expression may throw some sort of error if evaluated without a check. The first expression can be a pre check that the 2nd is even safe to try to evaulate. 
Transcrypt seems pretty amazing to me. I think a [jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) would be a wonderful addition to the tooling. 
Just ignore those job requirements. Lots of people have careers as programmers without having a degree, and many of those same companies are happy to hire them.
Awesome! Glad it got solved quickly 
Good exercise but I can't see when that'd be useful
The solution is either publish the package to a repository or love with copy paste
I'll further elaborate on this for others who might be confused: Write your reusable code with the mindset of being a "library". Think about your classes, functions, whatever as being project-agnostic. Make everything configurable through constructors and define your APIs in such a way that using them for your current project puts all "project specific" code in the project itself, not in the library. Then, put all that code into a separate directory from your current project. Write a simple `setup.py` that allows the code to be imported. You can then either push it to `PyPi` if you need to use it externally, push it to a local `DevPi` instance if you're working with confidential code within a business, or you can just simply `cd` to the directory and install it locally with `pip install -e .` like the comment I'm responding to suggested. This has the added benefit of installing it as `editable` (that's what the `-e` is) which means if you change the library code, you don't need to reinstall.
Yes, if you are going to distribute the code in some way, you will need to include whatever module you used among the tools. But it allows you to pick out only the function(s) you are actually using. But I do lot of scripting and tinkering, and this allows me a quick way to put things together and test it out with little fuzz. 
Volunteer to sit in on their code reviews and nail them for it.
Also, 0 is false in terms of truthiness. So never use truthiness when testing the existence of a number, unless you're explicitly using 0 to declare a value as invalid. Even if that's the case, I agree that explicit is better than implicit.

Here is an introductory course from MIT you might want to start with. It's had over 1 million people enroll: [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0) The course is free to try. &amp;#x200B; The Georgia Tech Python program consists of four courses, but they are free to try as well. &amp;#x200B; Hope that helps, Josh from edX &amp;#x200B;

Oh I do. The problem is my most brilliant developers (rightfully showoffs) always do this so I have to be careful how I handle it.
This leads to another fact a lot of people don't know: `True` and `False` are relatively recent additions to the language. They were only introduced in Python 2.3, and only after a great deal of debate. `x or y` worked fine for more than 10 years before `True` and `False` even existed.
That's not a good example since why would you `sleep(0)`, and in any case if you did, the result would have been the same. 
No, True and False are both singletons of the boolean type. `is` is correct. Now, technically, in cpython so are integers up to 255 though...
Invent a point system that they would care about. (Maybe points can be traded in for something they want? Even PTO, if necessary.) Reward points in code reviews for highly readable code. Hope that point system enacts a culture change in your dev group.
Thanks. However, does Microsoft have the same API?
Thanks. I will.
Author of the linked article here. You are correct, I should have mentioned Cython (and others) not just PyPy as a possible solution. I tried Cython several years ago when I was less experienced and it seemed complicated at the time and performance wasn't as much of an issue to warrant the effort. I should revisit it again now that I'm a little more confident. There are so many of these efforts to speed up python (nuitka, numba, gopy, pythran, stackless, shedskin, etc...) that it can be overwhelming, some of them I've looked at either only support Python 2.x or only double the performance of CPython. &amp;#x200B; The NimPy method just seemed very easy and the extension modules work with both Python 2 and 3. I'm happy with Nim so far, but I'll take another look at Cython. &amp;#x200B; Thanks
More likely you'd have `sleep(some_func())`, which is clearer (to me) then: sleep_seconds = some_func() if sleep_seconds: sleep(sleep_seconds) But `sleep()` was just an example of a function that legitimately takes falsy arguments. There are plenty of others.

Thanks I’ll try that:)
1. You've posted a photo of your monitor, rather than your actual code and error message. A photo is a bitch to read. 2. You've posted to the wrong sub, this should be on r/learnpython 3. The indentation in `leaderboard()` is messed up. 4. You've hard coded a password in plain text. 5. You've forgotten brackets, it should be `choice=int(input())`. Just now, you're passing `int()` the function `input`, rather than the output of the function `input`.
It does. Anything you can do in JavaScript you can do in Transcrypt.
Hey sorry I wasn't trying to call you out. It was a good article I don't regret reading it at all. It's just that since Cython already comes with your standard Python installation and it's trivial to incorporate into your existing codebase* it was odd that it wasn't included. Happy to take a crack at it later when I get home if you'd like to save yourself the trouble. *Not an Cython expert by any means - just seen a talk or two on the subject.
I have less experience and avoid "or" because it never did what I humanly expected it to, but after seeing all the examples here, it makes it look like a debugging feature, or at worst a useless feature.

It's very handy for default values for `input()` calls. age = input("What is your age? [21] ") or 21
I apologise for this:) thank for the info. I will try it.
I think you should look what can do the majority of libraries, and then, go further only if you need them
I am on the phone, so formatting is gonna be a bitch, but x = input().strip() try: choice = int(x) except ValueError: print("I write the worst error messages, but that wasn't an integer") But I would go a step further and place everything in an infinite loop (learned this trick by hitting the same exception 322 times), so while True: x = input("Give me your best number").strip() try: choice = int(x) break # don't remember if Python calls its breaks break except ValueError: print("not a number, try again")
Can you post the entire code? From the scope that I can see, the `leaderboard` function needs to be called to set choice. Without the function being called, choice is not defined hence the error.
"x or y" is equivalent to "x ? x : y" in C/C++. 
[Sure](https://pypi.org/project/O365/), but I don’t have any experience with it.

Start out by getting a general sense of what the modules do. I spend half my time in online documentation when I need to use one.
How do you use pycharm 
You need to indent the “If” Statements and all of the code bellow the it. That should correct your mistake.
You want a discontinuity between `func(1)`, `func(.5)`, `func(.1)`, `func(.001)`, and `func(0)`? That would surprise its users, surely.

Internal response: "Bro, I don't even plan to be here next year."
defaultdict creates the object of the given type if the key does not exist. dict.setdefault takes care of this in normal dictionaries, but defaultdicts are still nice syntactic sugar *on-set*. On *read*, do you want a KeyError on missing key or the default created object? That's what should make your decision. If the answer is "I don't care about that", then use whichever method is faster (defaultdict is faster than dict.setdefault). If your default is dependent on the key, however, always use setdefault.
Finally finishing my compiler for the Nand2Tetris project. First had to salvage what Windows Update had left of my dual boot Debian system. Then had to setup an environment in windows for Python. Hope I can figure out where I was in the process a few months ago. Luckily the code is heavily commented. 
Thank you for the thorough and well thought out response. I didn't want to post to lengthy of a post, but to answer one of your questions I did specify in my post that I am married to a Microsoft SQL Server, which unfortunately I can't divorce anytime soon. So it is a relational database, and it is used with an information management system. Typical accounts, contacts, addresses, some very specialized data associated with said accounts, and the need to take all that data and report on it. In regards to early scalability, let me clarify by stating that I have not purchased a 3yr contract on an amazon r5.12large instance. I am merely trying to think about scalability in the future. I don't want to be building a city with a one lane highway, and then later have to demolish all the buildings built along said highway because I need more lanes. Ill build the one lane highway, and allow enough room, for more lanes to be built in the future. Maybe I am mistaken, but aren't REST APIs simply endpoints to data that is queried from a database? I plan on building out RESTful web services, but at the end of the day, that data still comes from my SQL database. No? I definitely appreciate your post, and I think perhaps I misinterpreted some of your post, so I would also appreciate you correcting anything I misinterpreted.
**No**. In the field of computer programming, as in many specialised fields, English words take on a more precise meaning than in normal conversational English. [Short-circuit evaluation](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) is a well established feature of many programming languages, and can be used in an idiomatic way in Python and is the feature that the Python 'or' operator performs. You might try a few exercises using Pythons short-circuit operators to familiarise yourself with them as they can be useful. :-) &amp;#x200B;
That would be best, however I don't want to wait for that. Some things that seem obvious, just never happen in IT. But who knows....
Using `is` would be more idiomatic. [pep-8 has a section](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations) recommending comparisons to singletons (like `True` or `None`) should be done with `is`.
True. If we’re concerned about deleting default keys, perhaps use an immutable dictionary?
Nice, that covers some use cases, yeah. Will add it to list of things to look at.
\`x and y\` returns \`x\` if \`x\` is false, \`y\` otherwise :) &amp;#x200B;
&gt; really confusing bugs with nested empty collections * A collection is not empty if it has an entry; *any* entry. * An empty collection placed inside a collection is an entry of the outer collection. * A None value, or False, or Zero, or NaN, ... when placed inside a collection is an entry of the outer collection making it non-empty. Hope that helps :-)

Thank you I really appreciate it &amp; I’m sure I will 
Defaultdict is rather meant for another use case. Example: suppose you have a bunch of addresses, and you want to group them by zip code. Using defaultdict, it works like this: zip_addresses = defaultdict(list) for address in addresses: zip_addresses[address.zip].append(address) With a regular dict, you'd have to check if the list for that zip code already addressed every time, and make it if it doesn't. The update method has a totally different use case.
So, are people expected to write full-blown _tutorials_ in the comments? I mean, a tutorial often requires a full blog post; documentation of simple built-in modules can be pages and pages long. I’m not sure a tutorial would fit in a comment. Or, the comments will be so huge it would be nearly impossible to find anything...
That's really condescending. I've been writing Python for over a decade.
look in the distro package manager
Thanks for the reply but what for that mean where do I find it wjat am I looking for, Sorry I'm very new to this
&gt; callable(foo) and foo() I generally dislike this kind of trick that can only be safely applied in some circumstances. In this case, you don't know whether `False` comes from `foo()` or from the absence of `foo`. The type of the expression is also a mildly uncomfortable `bool|T`.
oh shit, windows doesn't windows now have a package manager? You have a version conflict going on. Your version of Python does not match the library. ... consider upgrading your python.
Well, as written (no `if` statement) the result of the expression is thrown away, so its value and type ain't no nevermind.
You can. &amp;#x200B; Anaconda has cloud support so you probably can have Cloud-based environments. Which can be nice if you need to share them or do change machines.
Why is scraping such a big thing lately? I keep finding dozens of posts about it, but nobody ever really gets into what they are doing. When they do - it's generally something there is an API or RSS feed for already. Am I missing something?
It looks like the issue is that your operating systems(Windows) only support 32 bits application. Considering using the solution provided here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35202087/pyhook-on-python-3-5
Oh my god you've posted at least three of these crappy photos and support requests in this subreddit without reading the sidebar please stop. 
I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm perfectly aware of how the truthiness of collections is evaluated; the problem I'm trying to highlight is that in a large codebase maintained by dozens of engineers, assumptions surrounding function inputs don't always survive contact with the enemy, so to speak. As a result, this can propagate into hard-to-find bugs, which can be exacerbated when you don't explicitly check for None-ness when casting default args/kwargs.
&gt;That's really condescending. You've said that you have taken my comment in that manner, but remember, I did not know of your prowess before writing. ***You*** *chose* to take offense.
I believe that if you're not using the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) module then you're not writing Python. Recipes from the itertools docs are available at [https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/)
it could be your pip version to.
Explicit *is* better, but also simple is better than complex. In cases where it doesn't matter if it is None or just False-y, value = value or other_value if much better than value = value if value is not None else other_value or, heavens forbid, value = other_value if value is None else value 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; False or '' '' &gt;&gt;&gt; '' or False False FTFY
This comment is somehow more condescending than your previous one.. If someone says it isn't idiomatic to use 'or' in this manner, and then you say it is, then the fact that whether it is idiomatic is up for debate, means it isn't idiomatic. That said, there will always be cases where a feature of a language can be used, but it doesn't mean it should be used in all cases or shoehorned into usage to try and demonstrate your 'prowess'. 
pandas: NOTE: Pandas uses openpyxl as the default excel writer (you'll need it installed as well) NOTE: If your csv file has a header record you'll need to change this up a bit otherwise the header will be added as a record. import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('some_file.csv', names=['col1', 'col2']) df.to_excel('some_file.xlsx', 'my sheet name', index=False) &amp;#x200B;
You could use pandas... `import pandas as pd` `load csv file into dataframe` `csv_data = pd.read_csv('file_name.csv', sep='|')` `save data to excel file` `csv_data.to_excel('file_name.xlsx')` `you can also paste csv data straight to clipboard as well:` `csv_data.to_clipboard()` &amp;#x200B;
Lol so confused
Right, they're all talking about how sometimes something being 'Falsey' is still what you want, but I find that to be mostly a non-factor. Know what you're doing, and where it would cause problems. Is it incoming data that can be an int? Don't use it, since 0 would be False (and is often a valid input) Is it data that can be an empty string? Go for it, as long as you know that empty-string is false (this is pretty well known). Lists? Possible... but can be dangerous. Custom data structures? Probably don't do it. 
That reminds me that [the Wikipedia page for the null-coalescing operator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator#Python) still incorrectly lists `or` as the null-coalescing operator for Python.
There are literally dozens of tutorials for every single feature in Python just a google search away.
Most devs I know will never use all of the modules in the standard library. I do recommend looking over what each one does, just so you know what's possible. That said, if you want a place to start, here are the ones that I use the most often: * datetime. Seriously, don't reinvent the wheel * random. No matter what your field, you'll likely end up using this at some point. * sys and os, for when you have to deal with files or OS stuff. * csv. This one is surprisingly handy in my job, since I have to spit out and consume spreadsheets at least once a week. * logging, because you probably shouldn't be using a print statement to debug (even if many of us still do) * json. A lot of information out there comes in this format, so if you can master this library, you can do a LOT. Now, these aren't all of the modules I use, but these are the ones I use at least once a week that aren't a part of some other framework. These are just where I'd start.
[removed]
Using the `x if x is not None else default_value` pattern should *only* be used in the (normally extraordinary) cases where it's *necessary* to distinguish between actual `None` values and `False`-y values. If this is code that will only ever be used by you or a fixed set of developers and not a developer unfamiliar with your code, *ever* (so unlikely! Because realistically, future you is going to also be unfamiliar with your code) then unless it's very clearly documented, there are so many cases where someone might pass a False-y value (such as an empty list or dictionary, or an empty string) to a function or method, doing the `is None` or `is not None` check is going to break in those cases where you totally want *some* True-thy value. I actually prefer flipping the logic around and checking explicitly for the potential False-y value if it's meaningful: if val == False: do_false_thing() elif not val: val = other_val
It may very well be, although I don't know enough about Jupyter Notebook to fully appreciate the value of this. I can just hope that someone will make a proof of concept.
Defaultdict is not strictly necessary and often masks bugs but its slightly more convenient to use. Also no one uses .setdefault as often as they should. 
No...I was expecting more like Python networking, numpy, pandas, machine learning, file automation and similar topics for 1 comment. I think you misunderstood... They will just be requesting topics on which they want to see some tutorials and I will prepare them as per the requirement.
Generally no but they're good knowledge. Make sure you use that knowledge and that you're able to demonstrate it in a cv and in the interview. The certificate is nothing but you can impress them with your knowledge.
The answers is easy for me -- I'm asyncio maintainer :) In general though, asyncio is in the stdlib, so it will always be maintained and improved. I can't say the same about trio/curio with 100% certainty. Some concepts in trio are very good, so we're adding them to asyncio in 3.8.
Sure there are.... But for every topic there will be different use cases... So I will be parenting those topics from my point of view with the use cases that I have encountered. 
This worked very well for me. Thank you kind redditor :)
Last one should end with `other_value`. Your middle case isn't a correct representation. value = value or other_value is the same as value = value if value else other_value As the `or` does nothing with None. This is more typing. However, I would bet that 100% of developers would know exactly what is going on in the second. The percentage isn't as high with `or`. I would theorize that a large number of those trying to parse that expression would believe that `value == True` if either were Truthful, rather than what happens. I'll type more to make that NEVER happen. 
Polishing my dungeon crawler, there’s a few weird bugs going on with learning new spells and certain rooms. After that, I’m going to start the long process of implementing ASCII graphics 
I second this. Datetime will always be necessary, and there are a lot of things in this module that will make your life a lot easier (timedeltas make time/date math a breeze). random is always useful. json is a must, although I use a different module (simplejson) instead, since with the standard library json module, I always have problems serializing Decimal objects. All in all, it depends on what you do. I didn't pay attention to any web scraping packages until I had to do something involving web scraping. I have yet to get into asynchronous programming or socket programming with Python, so I haven't dove into the asyncio package or socket module.
Hopefully the data isn't valid for `''` or `0` or other values that are valid but not Truthy.
also &gt;&gt;&gt; None or 7 is True False
But I installed the 64 bit version of pywin32 &amp;#x200B;
Periodically calling `sleep(0)` performs a context switch with no added delay. It frees up the thread for a bit. I use this in tight looking data supplier class that receives requests from pipes in a round robin and gives responses. Core use goes from 100% to 10%, because OS gets a break. On Unix a better option might be `os.nice(level)`, but this doesn't work on Windows, I don't believe.
I've only just installed them so they are the latest versions that they can be &amp;#x200B;
A lot of the stuff I deal with only cares about truthiness. If the form is submitted but has a value of '' or 0, it's either invalid or should be disregarded
But then your dictionary is immutable meaning you cannot change its values or add non-default keys. Also an ImmutableDict-type does not exist by default. The idea of a type called frozendict analog to frozenset was rejected in PEP416. There is a PyPI-package called frozendict though.
Then you are all good. Most of the time I see people getting bit are the edge cases.
True, it can be a bit more difficult to debug around edge cases with this method.
The same thing applies to the `and` operator, although it is not used as often. The last value that determined the outcome (whether success or failure) is always returned: In [1]: "foo" and "bar" Out[1]: 'bar' In [2]: 0 and "bar" Out[2]: 0 In [3]: "foo" and [] Out[3]: [] 
boolean short-circuiting in action. if the first operand is false, the whole OR expression is determined by the second operand (`false or ?` is ?). On the other hand if it's true, checking the 2nd is unnecessary, as `true or ?` is always true. AND works in reverse. `false and ?` is always false, `true and ?` is ? that said, avoid such subtleties if you don't feel particularly comfortable with them. It's a worthless kind of brevity.
How would I use code blocks? and I just realized this..PS, This is also OptedOut.. &amp;#x200B;
operator precedence. `is` is stronger than `or`, so `7 is True` is calculated first to produce False. It's like having a problem with 1+2*3 being 7, not 9
I apologize, we probably just have different experiences with different bodies of code using this. I've definitely seen it used for error handling as in PHP (e.g. `do_operation() or sys.exit(1)`). You didn't know my experience and I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. :)
Thanks for posting this point, because it is such a key point. I'll have to see if there is a runnable archive, maybe docker images or something similar, of each older Python version. It'd be fun to explain this and other Python behaviors by showing them how it used to work in Python 1. :) One of the great joys of Python in particular, but other languages as well, is going back and deleting code that can be replaced by a simpler, more elegant version thanks to new constructs like generators, iterators, contextmanagers, etc.
Water is wet.
I'm not sure I want to be using that, if I wanted to write hard to read code I'd rather use brainfuck.
Precedence doesn't matter here. It's just that 'or' does not evaluate to a boolean. (None or 7) is True would still be False.
I think it's because it's a fairly useful way to learn programming. It takes a bit of work, enough failure to easily have to look stuff up, and because it's a project everyone can get behind doing or can find some use in doing. Honestly there may be APIs or RSS feeds already but a lot of learning to program is making something you find use out of so eh to each their own
I think pip will allow you to backport. see if you can install an older version of the library.
C's || operator also short-circuits and can have arbitrary expressions as operands.
well, setdefault wastes time instantiating the default object every single time it's called.
An older version of pyHook?
Well, this horrible-looking `DateAndTimepattern` is a _regular expression_. These beasts allow you to extract the structure from structured data. For example, you somehow _feel_ that the dates are similar, right? There must be a pattern that any such date will _match_. So, regular expressions are used to describe this common pattern. It’s a language used to describe structure (another example of such a language is a context-free grammar). So, you should learn how regular expressions (regexes) work, for great good! (Seriously, they’ll save you a lot of headache when parsing stuff; they’ll also bring additional headache too, but it’s worth it).
&gt;You said it was not idiomatic Python which is wrong. I've used Python since version 1.4, and I'd say that using 'or' short-circuiting to replace if/else (as opposed to basic boolean truthiness testing) is definitely \*not\* idiomatic Python. Yes, it gets used on occasion, but over the years it has also been shown to be so error prone that it is often \*heavily\* discouraged. (The ternary operator battles had a \*lot\* to say about these uses of or/and shortcutting). &amp;#x200B; For bash/shell developers I'd say that it's idiomatic, sure. But though it's allowable in Python, it's never been the idiom.
yes. older library or newer Python, is the typical. I have seen it reverse but that means other more concerning issues. Like the library is so out of date, it may not be possible. In this case, you google for what the pyHook replacement/update is. These libraries do not last forever.

Thank you so much will try!
Yeah every once-in-awhile I am again reminded of this and then again soon forget it. It doesn't seem very intuitive, I'd rather just not use it. I put it in same catetory as a for-else statement.. like good to know it exists incase you see it... but easy enough to not use and avoid ever causing confusion.
you picked a shitty example then, because precedence affects the order of operation here and you can't pretend it does not. &gt; (None or 7) is True would still be False. how about next time you start with it. 
I use for/else about once a week and I think it's pretty handy - in some cases. This might come in handy every now and then. I'm happy to find these little gems, it makes my code look smart. 
I tried bit earlier version. Webpack bundler worked better for me. Maybe I will try parcel next project but I have a habit of keeping using what works. 
Behold, the `datetime` module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
Okay so a few things here: 1. If you have a 32bit python module, it will only work with 32bit python. If you have 64bit python, you need the 64bit version of module. If there is no 64bit version of the module (sometimes the case) you need to install 32bit python to use it. Since you're going to be using pypiwin32, I would recommend getting 32bit python so everything matches 2. You downloaded "pyhook-1.5etc.whl" which is a wheel file. From my experience wheel files don't install with pip, you need to "pip install wheel" and "pip install easy-install" if you don't already have them. If python and pip are in your PATH environment, then you can use cmd prompt to "cd path/to/your/pyhook/download.whl" and "python -m wheel install pyhook" should work 3. If python and pip paths ("C:\Python37\" and "C:\Python37\Scripts\") are not environment variables, those need to be added to PATH. This will save you a lot of headaches later when installing modules in the future. Without those, simply typing "pip install x" or "python myscript.py" will give you all sorts of problems. If any of this is confusing I'll be glad to help. I know this is all daunting and discouraging, I feel like I've experienced just about everything that can go wrong with python lol but once you get through all the setup headaches it gets a lot more fun I promise :)
&gt;we probably just have different experiences with different bodies of code using this. Aye, we probably do. &amp;#x200B; All the best :-) &amp;#x200B;
Not just leap year, but missing days (yes, it happens eg regime change). Use a date library as this calculation is very hard to get right due to all the politics of date changes. 
I think I angered him in email telling him I found sqlitedict -- how can we get them to adopt his transaction processing model ("with" lexically)?
How about I fix my hastily written example and you learn to take life a little less seriously? Deal? It's ok to not be entirely correct once in a while. You'll be ok.
Thank you so very much for Such a comprehensive reply I'll try these steps and tell you what happens, thanks again!!
This was a three-month student project in a Programming Languages class. It doesn't support classes and a host of other Python functionality, but it can compile Python code to LLVM and native binaries that run (generally) a lot faster than the standard Python compiler. It uses Python 3.7-style type annotations to help with the type-inference and optimization - type-inferred immutable variables get placed on the stack and run a lot faster than Python, and type-hints are enforced either at compile-time or runtime depending on what the compiler can type-infer. We wrote the whole thing in OCaml, using LLVM for code-generation. There's [an installer](https://github.com/ja3067/Coral/releases) for MacOS, but otherwise you can build from source and test it out for yourself by cloning the repo and running make (if you have ocaml and the ocaml-llvm bindings installed). The demos folder has some examples where Coral can compile Python to binaries which run much faster than the standard interpreter, almost as fast as C. Feel free to ask any questions!
This is interesting: ``` In [24]: if []:print(1) # to be expected In [25]: if not []:print(1) # to be expected 1 In [26]: if []==True:print(1) # confusing! In [27]: if []==False:print(1) # confusing! ```
Thank you for the link! I went through the information, but I am still having trouble with my code. This is what I have so far: say = "Welcome user! What is your name? " name = input(say) say2 = "What is your address? " address = input(say2) sayphone = "What is your phone number? " phonenumber = input(sayphone) print ("What is your date of birth? ") say4 = "Enter Numerical Year: " year = int(input(say4)) say5 = "Enter Numerical Month: " month = int(input(say5)) say6 = "Enter Numerical Day: " day = int(input(say6)) print ("Name:") print (name) print ("Address:") print (address) print ("Phone Number:") print (phonenumber) import datetime yearsold = 2018 - int(year) monthsold = 13 - int(month) datetime.timedelta(days=1) today_year, today_month, today_date = list(map(int, str(datetime.date.today()).split("-"))) print ("Date of Birth:") def monthsold(): return today_month - month if (today_month - month &gt;= 0) else 12 + today_month - month print ("You are", yearsold, "years,", monthsold(), "months and", today_date - day, "days old.")
Sorry, I don't know the sqlitedict project or what you're talking about.
Hmm, maybe someone with more expertise can improve [my efforts](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt/issues/603) to get SAP UI 5 running with Transcrypt. It would be nice to have a full-featured UI available.
Sounds like [Brython](https://brython.info/) to me.
You bet! Ya lemme know; I feel you for real, I know firsthand how frustrating all this is so if I can save you a fraction of that frustration I'm happy to :)
IIRC, ANDed statements return the second condition. 
&gt;&gt; (None or 7) is True would still be False. &gt; how about next time you start with it. Incidentally, due to short-circuiting I think that 'a or b is True' can only evaluate to True if a is the literal value 'True' (or an expression that evaluates to True). And of course, 'is' doesn't even get evaluated in those cases.

This is now a long-term project for me.
I'd try doing it differently: create a Datetime instance for Date of birth, and one for right now (Datetime.today or something? Can't Recall). You then can call the timedeltamethod of one with the other one as Parameter iirc and have your exact values I'm just on mobile so I can't verify everything right now
An alternative would be to use a Raspberry Pi. Since you have experience with Vultr, using Raspian will be as easy.
I recommend you to try a « python tutorial », that you’ll find on the web. It’s clearly late to develop something big, but you can show people what python looks like anyway ! 
So would you say this would be good for beginners or not at all? 
Image Palettizer 2.0: reduces the colors in an image to those of the specified palette, now with dithering. Also reworked the documentation and included an example, and I’m pretty happy with it. CC welcome. https://github.com/PureAsbestos/Image-palettizer
I have heard many people talk about how they wish that they started using logging earlier instead of using print. What did you find was the biggest improvement between the two? Being able to define different levels of logging, setting up logging to file automatically, or something else?
The only problem that Transcrypt isn't really Python. It's a translator. It's still reeks of the JS VM.
Yeah, that is why i was hoping someone had any open source suggestions or projects of their own they'd want to share or something like that. But i will try to find a tutorial and code like a champ the next two days 😅
Thank you for giving me a new way of looking at it! I'll give it a try!
You can try to write a little game, like tic-tac-toe ! Be brave, it can be fun, and tou will learn a lot 👍

&gt; if it is None This is wrong. You probably meant if it can be tested for false value. 
Right. I was talking in practical terms on how you may use it.
OK. That doesn't help me understand, if it was meant to. I don't know who "he" is or "them" are or what feature you wish were part of which project, or why, or what "this" long term project is. 
Yeah, don't do this. `and` and `or` shortcutting was basically depreciated back around 2.4 because it reads really poorly. You're not returning both the object and the property, but it reads like you are. This TIL is worth forgetting once you've learnt it. 
&gt; FTFY. Code in reddit markdown is not surrounded by triple `, but indented by four spaces Actually… [in the redesign it is](https://new.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aimo2c/til_the_real_behavior_of_or_expressions/eep6nc8/). I know, I think it's bullshit that Reddit's markdown syntax differs across versions of the site (and I generally think the redesign is a slow mess), but if the commenter you're replying to uses the Redesign, then that syntax is valid from their perspective.
I think I might have accidentally angered Charles Leifer in email because I was asking about work that he may see as stolen from him. 
Which is exactly why that syntax was introduced. 
Code wants to be dumb. That way you understand it when you read it 2 weeks later.

Well without the rest of the function, it'd be hard to say. But in general, I'd want 0 to act like None in the sense that I asked it to sleep for "nothing". In your case, realistically I'd say "time = time or 0", which is a perfect example of what OP is talking about. But yeah in your specific example I wouldn't want "sleep 0" to be actually "sleep 10".i didn't read too closely. But I WOULD want the truthiness of None to act the same as 0. 
Be explicit and you never have to worry about getting bitten in the ass by some bizarre language quirk.
Was it something like [progressbar](https://pypi.org/project/progressbar2/) ?
 &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(None or 7) is True True You're applying different operations in each example. I don't understand your point.
Command line RPG game could be fun. Could up your OOP skills big time. At least, it did for me.

You can use smtp module from standard library to send and imaplib to read your inbox
It could definitely be helpful for catching beginner mistakes, like passing the wrong types to the wrong functions. You can just say what types your functions should have, and use those. This also has the potential to be a lot nicer with error messages, since it can throw errors at "compile-time", instead of forcing you to run the whole code to get a usage error. Right now, though, it doesn't have as robust documentation as Python and might make it harder to debug your errors.
*\[...\]* *would be really nice of you to give me your code* *\[...\]*
You write: &gt;This comment is somehow more condescending than your previous one.. Since, as stated, I wasn't trying to condescend, I would have thaught you found it easy to write condescendingly; but why? 
This is really awesome. It always seemed like such a bummer that all the effort of adding type-hints doesn't result in any run time speed increase. Being able to AOTC compile your application and enforce typing seems like a logical step for the language. Cool stuff!
This seems like a weird trick and kind of is for python which places a lot of emphasis on readability (over conciseness), but this idiom is relatively common in other languages (e.g., [javascript](http://www.grauw.nl/blog/entry/510) see also this [discussion](https://dev.to/mustardsauce/short-circuits--clean-code-1dn)). In reused python, I generally avoid short-circuiting behavior (except exploring data in the shell) or where I feel it's very obvious from context (e.g., one side is a literal). Like if I had a possibly null database object that's either a string or `None` (like a middle name), but say never something else that's falsey and I want to coerce into an empty string: mname_str = person.mname or '' Seems cleaner and easier to read than a more explicit: mname_str = person.mname if person.mname is not None else or '' or if person.mname is not None: mname_str = person.mname else: mname_str = ''
The point is basically "don't use 'is True' with 'or' because 'is True' will only match the literal value 'True' and 'or' expressions don't usually evaluate to boolean True or False, they evaluate to one of the arguments of 'or'. Just a variation on the theme that "If x:" is very different than "If x is True:".
r/learnpython sorry
Maybe look at the [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) documentation, otherwise possibly [openCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
Yes something like that but it was quite straightforward code and it looked really cool.
Active Directory is Microsoft's LDAP implementation. If you find code to work with LDAP, it can probably be adapted to work with AD.

Great article 
I do wonder if this will be contentious or not in the Python community. My first experience with these operators were in Kotlin and I honestly loved the feature, not 100% sold on the syntax but it's not too bad. 
Somebody has never had to deal with OS scheduling.
Thanks for making this resource free :)
There's less value in using Anaconda now compared to 5y ago - the big difference is that Containerization is a better solution to the problems that Anaconda was trying to solve. It used to be that if you were running a less common platform (like Windows for example), getting some Python components required rather a lot of work: You'd need to install a Visual C++ Compiler, possibly a Fortran compiler to get everything in your scientific python stack working. It was a total pain, and in a locked-down commercial environment, you would be better off just outsourcing all your dependency management to Conda. These days I just use normal Python for Linux inside a Docker container - everything works easily regardless of what the host OS is. Normal Pip + Pypi is good enough. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

AWS/GCP/Docker/Kubernetes...I personally prefer Kubernetes as it's powerful and I regularly host flask applications on it, not just python though.
You need to learn to understand the code. Python is just syntax. It reads easier, but that doesn’t mean code is to understand easier. IMO. Programming has very little to do with a language. It’s more of a concept. Try to understand what is the problem they are willing to solve. Then read the code. 
And keep notes about what's in there. 
Yeah, this way lies leftpad
Week I mean there's `cron` and windows scheduler...
Maybe tqdm? https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4wxlvq/tqdm_a_simple_and_fast_progress_bar_module_wrap/
Python to Web assembly would be cool.
There are also alot of web scraping gigs in the $50 to $200 bracket on many freelancing platforms. It's actually a skill that's in demand and many times the scraping is on websites that dont have an API or RSS feeds.
Oh ok, thanks
Please read the sidebar of any subreddit before posting there. The environment variable you're trying to access isn't there. 
A CLI cross platform library for simple yet necessary functionality of common tasks. iE setting your rig to sleep after x amount of seconds. 
also note that 'is' is not the same as 'equal to' - 'is' will check the identity of the object and return True if they are the same object.
this doesnt work when false is a valid value.
I use LDAP3 to tie my python code into our active directory system
Thanks.
You are welcome mate, enjoy it =)
The comments in the other thread you posted (visible via "other discussions" tab here on reddit) suggest you didn't really do your homework before suggesting a violation on someone else's part. That's not a good sign for an article which claims to offer advice on the topic.
Here's a few patterns I use. If you have to convert a value to a string or something (json serializable), but want to preserve None (also prevents isoformat() called on None, raising an exception): d['datetime'] = d['datetime'] and d['datetime'].isoformat() If you want to have some value fall back from one value to another to another, like a function that first checks a keyword, then a config, then an OS env var if it doesn't exist in any of those: ENV = environment or config['env'] or os.getenv('env', 'dev') To ensure it's a lowercase stripped string from user input that is optional, because null could be passed explicitly and that would raise an exception with strip/lower: value = (request.get('user_input') or '').strip().lower() To get around the whole list/dict in keyword argument thing, where it sets it to ONE list/dict if you put it in the kwarg but you want it by default an empty list or dict: def func(foo, bar_list=None): bar_list = bar_list or [] (otherwise if you put `bar_list=[]` it acts very funny if bar_list is modified, because the next time that function is called it has the modified version, same object. It's almost like a closure variable.) If user input is passed via a field or something, and it defaults to empty string from the frontend but you want to convert that to null: value = request.get('user_input') or None There really are a million ways to use this. Just make sure readability doesn't suffer the way you use it, but most of these are perfectly understandable.
Look at Mr/Ms Rich Kid over there with the infinite heap memory!
None is often used as a sentinel value for a default behaviour, particularly if said default behaviour is subject to change.
Writing a program to generate a random dataset based on a preexisting, confidential dataset. Basically it generates random variables within the range of the real variables and repopulates the dataset with these new numbers. Afterward it shuffles the dataset and randomizes the GPS locations of the data sources.
You should never choose one over the other, as it is good to expand your options and versatility. Python gives more of an English like syntax to read and forces you to indent correctly which can help make readability much better when returning to old code. &amp;#x200B; However as another poster said, understand the underlying mechanic you are trying to solve and make the code work around that, not the other way around. I was learning Python and Java at the same exact time, and although I preferred Python over Java, they both have their own strengths that can help, namely that Android is written with Java, not Python if I recall correctly. Python is good for data mining and such, not as glamorous as what Java is typically used for. Keep pushing in your studies and just take it with a grain of salt. One thing I noticed is to make a LOT of COMMENTS. That way you can go back and understand what scribblings you made. Best! 
That’s a good point, but I was offering an equivalent for what OP wrote, which said `if value is not None`. Definitely worth keeping your point in mind, though.
One big thing for me is being able to set logging level at one point in the code instead of needing to comment/uncomment or add/remove individual print statements
Exactly
And your coworkers can understand it 6 years later.

Groovy code is compiled to Java bytecode, and that bytecode is run on the Java virtual machine.
When you read job requirements just laugh. Apply for all the jobs.
Python Code gets compiled to Python bytecode and is run on the Python virtual machine directly. 
Thanks for your reply. Do you have set schedule on which language you’re going to program with on certain days? I personally feel like I should start with Python as it’s more of an English syntax then work my way up from there, would that be a good way to start? I have been studying Java core quite a bit, but not really been practical with it, which is possibly my problem as I know what some stuff does, but I can’t seem to put that knowledge into my own projects. I’ve learned some of the basics, such as variables, if statement, printing to the console, for loops, while, and some others which I have not mentioned. I can put these into basic programs and understand how they work, maybe I just don’t have a good imagination lol. 
Lol that's what we do actually. Spin up some stuff and jet
It works for me. Are you using the old Reddit?
The Python virtual machine is nothing like the Java virtual machine.
My brain is mush reading your previous interaction. I'll just avoid using or/True on the same line.
I don't have a set schedule at all haha probably why I failed. Haha. But I'm still trying! I'm currently learning netlogo which is a more specific programming language but needed for my class. There are websites to find good things to create. One I had fun with was a Coursera class as it made us create Android apps, so HTML for the front and a Java background. It was a nifty idea. As for prioritizing python I say go for it, and see what you can do. But do get an idea what you want to create and get a book with end of lesson examples so you can build and see how it works first hand. Like math, practice repeat and change a little to see what happens. 😁
Sorry, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Could you link me to what I said?
I get it, but just barely. That's why it was a huge bug for me in the past. I was receiving network traffic and if something went wrong it returned None. The problem was the user could send an empty string and then their message wouldn't be processed because `if ''` is False ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; bool('') False &gt;&gt;&gt; bool('1') True &gt;&gt;&gt; ``` Ok to be fair that's a different problem but you just helped me realize `if` casts (casting is the wrong term but that's the best I got) to Boolean and my use of *or* is an operational shortcut.
How much of a problem is it?
Any plans to add the ability to build a shared library so we can import Coral programs from normal Python?
It's comparing apples to oranges. Java and Groovy use the same VM, while Python uses a different VM (you could hardly even say it's a VM, it's more like an interpreter). I don't know what's the current status of Jython project, but that would be a more apples to apples comparison.
IIRC, Jython is a straight-up interpreter. The Python code runs on a VM written in Java.
Other alternative Java scripting languages (Jython) are also compiled to bytecodes, but they are very slow. So, the implementations are wildly different. Is it possible Python has same problems as Jython (which is very slow) but on C? 
Why are you worried about duplicate coverage? Is it to make the test suite run faster? I think duplicate coverage is inevitable, especially if you're going to test all pathways of a function - you'll inevitably have duplicate coverage right up until the branch.
It's one of those things where I've got a bunch of context inside my head where I've seen people do silly things and I tried writing a quick example while working on something else and did a horrible job of conveying that context. The morning of the story is pretty much never use "x is/== True/False" unless you are 100% sure that your are comparing the values True/False AND you for some reason want to return differently if you get a value that isn't a boolean, like "1". Ala: if x is True: return "yep!" elif x is False: return "nope!" else: raise ValueError("I don't understand") Since Python is all about the duck typing, usually you won't do that and instead will just use something like: return "yep!" if x else "nope!" I'm on my phone, so apologies if this ends up wrong or ugly. 😋
&gt; bummer that all the effort of adding type-hints doesn't result in any run time speed increase True, but as it stands adding type-hints doesn't slow down your compile time which is nice =) 
Just to show you what I mean, OP, I ran your code on my machine: (I have no idea why you'd cast nanotime into an int representing seconds in a benchmark, by the way. I got rid of that.) Java: 3.485042385 Groovy: 3.518173863 Python (CPython): 28.1455349922 Python (PyPy): 3.46548891068 The problem isn't with Python itself. The problem is with the VM. For certain classes of problem (like this one), PyPy is a crazy fast VM, able to go toe-to-toe with the JVM. However... you really need to learn how to write better benchmarks. With java, you should be using something like jmh. With python, you should be using something like timeit.

That's really not how programming works sorry. Python being close to English (even if true) won't make it easier to learn. You need to learn programming not Python and regardless if you use Java and Python you'll learn the same core skills. The reason some people think python is easier is because "it's of higher abstraction" which means most things written in Python will probably be shorter than equivalent Java code since python will do more things for you under the hood. Just ignore all this stuff and focus on learning programming.
Working on scraping multiple websites for rentals available in my area. Making it scrape price, address, any contact info, and the web link all into a csv file for easy readability and have it run periodically to find new places or price changes!
I’ve ran into a little problem with strings and ints. I’m watching a YouTube tutorial and he skips the output of adding a int to a string. For example check below. my_age = 20 print(“my age is” + my_age + “.”) He doesn’t show the output of the above and I seem to be getting an error. “ can only concatenate str (not int) to str. I know what the problem is, I’m very much aware of what concatenation is, but I’m unsure of how to concatenate a string to int. Tried doing a google search, found a few problems on it, but I couldn’t properly understand the code. I should probably look for another guy to watch on YouTube.

Does anyone use this in production? Is it worthwhile for large and complex projects? Can I use it to avoid learning React/Angular etc. I just can't wrap my python mind around JS stuff.
No those are clear points. I like how explicit you are with raising the error. I think you influenced my work tomorrow. 
Thank you for making me download python, as I forgot to do so when I made a fresh install on my home computer. &amp;#x200B; Okay, working through your issue, I was almost able to figure out everything to do right except the spacing at the end. You had the right idea, almost. Although for safety purposes I also defined the my\_age as an integer, as java requires it, python not so much, however what you did that works in Java, doesn't work in python. &amp;#x200B; `my_age = int(20)` `print("My age is" , my_age, ".")` &amp;#x200B; However, I can't get the spacing to work correctly for some awful reason. It prints out as you want it to, but Results: My age is 20 . &amp;#x200B; Someone may know or you may be able to figure it out why it's creating that, or I may with more tinkering, but as of this, it concatenates as you want to, almost. Joining str and int with + could be a Python 2 thing? I'm not sure, but using a comma works in v3. Hope that helps! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Oh shoot, I just realized what going on here. `None or 7` doesn't evaluate to a Boolean, it evaluates to 7, which is an int not a bool. The *is* operator compares instances of objects.
Well, it will return x if x is falsy (that is when cast to a boolean as `bool(x)` if it is False) and otherwise return y. Note x will be falsy for most "empty" things (basically equal to zero/None/False or an zero-length container) like `None, False, [], (), {}, set(), '', 0, 0L, 0j, 0.0`. So be careful not to use `x and y` idiom where you want `y` only if `x is None` if a valid value of `x` could be say 0 or an empty string and the default of `y` is incorrect in this case.
You should see it in the Reddit editor. Just hover over each tool, I believe it has an A with a square as the icon but don't recall and limited to mobile now.
Tried your result, works great except for the full stop at the end, as you explained above. Can’t seem to figure it out either, managed to do str(is true) to see if it works with booleans, which it does but if it’s for python 2 I’d rather not use it 
If you're using python 3.6 or above i prefer fstrings...print(f"my age is {my_age}.")
&gt;print(f"my age is {my\_age}.") This works brilliantly. Thank you for helping out!
Ok, I confirm that PyPy is very fast, as fast as Java and Groovy from this Stackoverflow example. I'm getting also around 3 sec : &amp;#x200B; `pypy MonteCarloPI_CPython.py` `Time for calculations (sec): 3.45997095108` `Pi = 3.1414614` &amp;#x200B;
% is modulo (remainder) division. What is your confusion?
 -- in general JVM should be faster than CPython for similar code, b/c JVM will JIT-compile the bytecode thus avoiding bytecode interpretation overhead. Dynamic typing overhead is separate though. -- your groovy code actually specifies types, can you change the code to use dynamic typing? -- groovy's implementation language is irrelevant: what matters is JVM's implementation language (which I think is C++) 
It looks like Groovy is static typed. Because python is loosely typed each variable carries around a little meta data storing it's type. This meta data is checked every time it's accesed. After doing some googling I found this answer that does a better job explaining: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41622341/why-is-type-checking-expensive
Well, that is news for me. Thanks!
Def even(num): If num % 2== 0: print ('even') Else: Print ('odd') You are welcome
To actually answer your question: no, in python, 0 is a Falsy value. This means that checking it in a conditional is equivalent to checking ‘if False’. The same is true of an empty list, empty dict, empty set, and many other python values. Also, this question is better for /r/learnpython 
Now you should make a program that recognize this kind of adulterations and then improve your first program.
Maybe [moviepy](http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) can help.
The purpose is just to randomize the data. I am in the process of optimizing the algorithm though, I'm very anal-retentive when it comes to program optimization. 
Correct! Though if 7 == True: would also evaluate to False. It is only in the Boolean context like if x: or while x: that x is implicitly coerced to a Boolean by calling its __bool__ (py3) or __nonzero__ (py2) method.

If you don't plan on running arcpy, work with your IT. The latest builds on Windows don't even need admin access I believe. You can't upgrade the python version of any Esri install outside of installing newer versions of the parent software and I don't know how fast they plan to distribute full major builds.

 def even(num): print("odd" if num % 2 else "even") Just because...
&gt;value = value or other\_value Dear god I never want to see code like this
Neither. Smart quotes are the devil. Also, you can just do `print()`
Not yet, but I have been working on other things and not pursued it :( 
Just fucking do both of them and see what the differences are. It's not hard. It's two lines of code in any python REPL. Did this literally just not occur to you? Or you could look at the documentation! Either is fine, both is great! ``` print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False) Print &lt;objects&gt; to the text stream &lt;file&gt;, separated by &lt;sep&gt; and followed by &lt;end&gt; ``` `end` is, by default, a newline. So telling python to print a newline, prints one newline followed by another. Telling python to print an empty string, prints an empty string followed by a newline. So the first prints 2 newlines, the second prints one. Am I going too quickly? Is this anything you couldn't have worked out either by reading that **one whole sentence** of documentation, or by typing **two lines** into a terminal? I guess maybe you're not up to reading that much, because you also missed /r/learnpython in the sidebar.
Shoot :( Well thanks for replying!
Everything you do is detectable in the modern world!
Much better to `getattr(obj, "prop", None)` or similar
I use asyncio for essentially everything now. The part that I wished was explained up front is the relationship between tasks, coroutine functions, coroutines, and call stacks. Also, the scheduling mechanism is important: one might think that every time the interpreter hits an \`await\` keyword, another coroutine might be swapped out, but nope, it is much simpler and deterministic than that.
When you take 2%2, you get 0, which is the numerical representation of the boolean "false". So what you're really saying is if (0), or if(false) so it skips to the else statement. A good way to say it would be if number%2 == 0
&gt; t doesn't support classes and a host of other Python functionality It doesn't support `elif`. &gt;I thought this was a cool proof-of-concept for a full Python compiler Yes, it is definitely a very cool proof of concept. One of these days, I swear, the moment I get some free time, I will look into collaborating/contributing to such a project.

How am i impersonating him, i don't even know the guy ... are you drunk or something? 
This is actually a good post for both subs. It's not uncommon to learn to lean on modules, third-party and/or built-ins that save time simply for the sake of not reinventing the wheel, as it might be seen. While convenient, there's the tax of not forming an understanding of these fundamentals, and I'm sure there are non-beginner python devs that could benefit from this. [Richie explains it quite well here:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914667/python-false-or-none-vs-none-or-false) &gt;Note that "true" and "false" in the above sentence are talking about "truthiness", not the fixed values True and False. Something that is "true" makes an if statement succeed; something that's "false" makes it fail. "false" values include False, None, 0 and \[\] (an empty list). Nice lil' sidewinder, /u/Hotdam14234!
How does perf compare with PyPy?
Have you looked into Nuitka (http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html#) at all? They already have full Python2/3 language compatibility in their compiler. They seem to be starting to do optimizations based on type hints now, so it would be awesome to reach out and contribute. Nice work!
I am. That said, I would not suggest it for more than one man projects. The existing stuff on JS side has so many fewer hurdles it is not even funny. Last project I set up I spent first two days working on how to build it and which set of JS stuff play nice with it. ( I do not suggest React at least ). Once I got setup done it is pretty fun. Using pytest for unit tests on python side is pleasant. Language behavior differences on the other hand are not. I guess that will gradually improve. 
...wut? Can you please...well, not ELI5 since I'm a *little* more competent than a five-year-old, but appsrently not enough to understand how `sleep(0)` does anything. What is "freeing up the thread"?

I learned about this in Lua and then tested in Python. For Lua it's an idiom.
Zero is very often not the default behaviour.
It is coincidental that I learned not too long ago that this exists in Javascript too, where it is used generously for cross-browser compatibility. I'm not sure when something counts as an idiom, but I guess you'll have to regard the same warnings you can read here in the comments. 
In certain types of threaded schedulers, a sleep() of any length will let another thread run while the process wait for the sleep interval to end, which is logical since if something else is waiting to run there's no sense delaying it while a thread sleeps. But a thread may sleep(0) to indicate that it doesn't necessarily have a set amount of time it needs to wait, but it's happy to relinquish it's current run slice if something else is waiting to run. If nothing else needs to run, the thread gets immediately scheduled again. It can often help with interactivity. Sleeping for zero seconds is a fairly normal thing to occur in the real world, just as asking for a 0 amount of a lot of resources is normal. malloc(0) is also a valid request, and while not super typical, it naturally arises under circumstances where a requested amount of resources may temporarily drop to zero.
`is True` is virtually never what you want. I believe pylint even treats it like an error.
Thanks but it’s needs to be from 2018 or 2019. 
Until somebody decides to override __bool__ on obj and your code breaks for very special values of obj.
Lua only evaluates `false` and `nil` to `false`, so you won't be shooting yourself in a leg. Would not recommend to use this trick in any other language.

&gt; a large number of those trying to parse that expression would believe that value == True if either were Truthful I mean, I disagree. IMO, `value = value or other_value` is an incredibly pythonic idiom and one that adds value to use python in the first place. I just don't believe that there are people who simultaneously do understand the `a if b else c` idiom but don't understand that `or` in python turn things into booleans. There are so many cases where I use something like `final_value = one_possible_value or another_possible_value or a_third_possible_value ...` and I can't possibly think how you would write this otherwise in python without being unwieldy. I guess something like: final_value = one_possible_value if not final_value and another_possible_value: final_value = another_possible_value elif not final_value and a_third_possible_value: final_value = a_third_possible_value I mean, is that literally what you are doing each time? Because honestly `z = x or y or z` seems **so much easier** and is *exactly how it works in python*.

I suppose you could always just write it as: if not value: value = other_value But so long as you understand how Python works: value = value or other_value does exactly this.
Ha, that's super interesting. I wasn't aware that the redesign uses different markdown, that's the stupidest thing I've heard all week! FWIW, in my mobile app "Relay" only the old system works as well. 
I assume the same goes for `value and other_value`?
Job specs are usually a wish-list of nice-to-haves, that someone in HR has assumed are actual requirements. If you match more than maybe 25% of it, just go for it - the worst that'll happen is you never hear back from them.
&gt; that's the stupidest thing I've heard all week! I'm with you on this. I question Reddit's strategy here.

The latter is much more readable no? I get being pythonic, but it seems like it could introduce issues. Or am I crazy?
I would like to know if there's a single line asyncio equivalent to `Thread(target = some_function).start()`, and, if not, why not or when can we expect it. It seems like the asyncio API exposes a lot of implementation details (ex. setting up event loops, scheduling tasks, explicitly yielding) that are abstracted away when using threads. Is there a reason for this?
Can I use asyncio to run blocking code without blocking? For example, I want my program to read a really big file without blocking the rest of the program so it can still accept other inputs, and then show a message when all 10 files are read. Is this a relevant use case of asyncio, or should I just use threads instead?
I wish there would be more articles about proper cleanup when you stop the event loop. It's quite common that you just fire and forget tasks but when you stop the loop you get many "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" warnings. 
Python 3.7 introduced the `asyncio.run()` method. See the Hello World example in the docs: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/asyncio.html
Oh, nice! I hadn't seen that.
Do you plan on this running entirely on the phone? Python is likely not fast enough to make this feasible, unless you're using a library like Tensorflow that is written in C and just has python bindings. If you expect much help here you're going to have to actually include useful information in your post - what exactly is the purpose of the app? How does it work algorithmically? Why are you doing it in python? Etc. Additionally, this may not be the best subreddit for this post, I'm not sure.
pytest-xdist so I can stick my tests into 8 threads and be done in 1,5 minutes instead of 30.
Sorry, should have read the sidebar. The choice of python is so I can use libraries like Tensorflow that you mentioned. I did refer to it as an app feature, the overarching idea is for the app to offer clothing options based on an individuals exact size; a kind of personalised fashion.
Store it in a db. Key on MLS#. As you gather each scrape, you can show a price change and price diff.
As a data scientist, why should I care?
Jesus, what side of the bed did you wake up on? A simple r/learnpython would have sufficed.
Sounds like MTailor which was presented on Shark Tank.
I like this question, as it cuts to the heart of 'When would I use it?' and makes for a good introduction to the OP's post. My answer would be along the lines of: It depends on your data sets. IO is slow, and a process often has spare time in the middle of doing it. If your code ever does things like download multiple data sets from the web, then you save on execution time and get your results a bit faster, and whoever pays the bill pays a bit less.
[https://pypi.org/project/aiofile/](https://pypi.org/project/aiofile/) probably does what you want for reading files (assuming that reading multiple large files into memory is a good plan) Your first question, though: The best use of async code is by using libraries that support it. If the code itself is written in a synchronous, blocking way then putting it in a coroutine isn't going to help, you'd need a separate thread for it. Modules like aiohttp and aiofile are written to work in an async environment.
I want to start using it in my backend web service, but I don't see any way to dip my toe in -- it seems like asyncio is all-or-nothing in terms of implementation. Am I wrong?
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
The two function absolutely identically as far as I'm aware. The only introduced is that of someone being unfamiliar with how Python works I suppose.
Yes, that's a perfect use for asyncio.
Even if it's true, it's a more correct comparison then with cpython.
You could just use `asyncio.run` to call a single function of your app in an asynchronous context if you like. 
For the last few weeks I have been playing with asyncio, its been very hard until I understood 2 things. 1. Running a function like ```foo()```, won't execute it, you need to await for it or create a task. (I know its written in the docs) 2. And the more important thing. Python doesn't know when to release control of the task. I was under the impression that Python can "understand" that I'm doing an IO task and release control. But that's wrong, you won't have any progress in any other task until you explicitly release control from the current one using "await"
how close are your models to real-time? What is the ingestion pipeline? How distributed is your cluster Stuff like that...
I can highly suggest [this](https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python) unofficial API by [LevPasha](https://github.com/LevPasha)
Yes! this is the one thankyou
You can do it, asyncio allows you to run a method in a Process executer or Thread executer. I would use a Process executer to read because its a cpu bound task.
Hey there, it is very obvious you are impersonating a person you dislike.
Are you doing lots of network IO? If not, then maybe not.
&gt; It seems like the asyncio API exposes a lot of implementation details (ex. setting up event loops, scheduling tasks, explicitly yielding) that are abstracted away when using threads. Is there a reason for this? Because everything is cooperative (and explicit) then there are no races.
when you single process python can saturate your 10G data pipeline though-output.
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18964080 , 2nd comment has the cython version
I'm using it. Our microservices mostly use flask, so they are synchronous. But there are places where I have to do real-time aggregation from 5-6 other services, so I use asyncio just there, in one place.
Re REST: if all data access was REST-ful, a full-fledged database would not be needed, a k-v store is enough. &amp;#x200B; There's of course no harm from a relational database; and if data access is mixed, then above certain threshold, good database is a must. For example transactions may be required, or effective foreign keys. &amp;#x200B; It's hard to say obliviously to app domain. You're married to a particular db, that's fine. That has an effect on your architecture that I wanted to highlight. &amp;#x200B; Re one-lane highway: Google Search is awesome right? And it only got 40K QPS in whatever year (google it). A single beefy machine can serve 1M QPS of simple queries (obv., Google Search is not simple). Depending on complexity of your app and data, you really might be fine serving the entire world with one machine (http.cat), or you may need a cluster for one user (e.g. scientific computing).
I wish I knew ``pdb`` worked as it should in asyncio. Somehow I assumed I was in thread not a coroutine and forgot that I could just add breakpoint to debug!
Just a general advice for your code examples you will include: comment every single line of your code. It makes your code understandable to literally everyone. There is always one dude out there, loving the topic but has not the same level of basic knowledge. It's actually no real effort and helps so much. I see that over and over again in blog posts. Anyway: Thank you for your question. Really clever to ask instead of writing just another random post about asyncio. Looking forward to read it :)
This really interests me. Need to learn how to work with that. Never dealt with a .DB before, especially with python. Seems like it'll make my life easier tho! Thank you!!!
venv still uses the underlying system python, although it can indeed isolate all the libraries. However, I think the conda infrastructure and features are better developed and, more importantly, support non-python libraries (e.g. compiled library dependencies). Also, storing package binary builds on anaconda-cloud for distribution is very convenient.
Someone has to put glados voice on this. 
look JavaScript in not Java ! and no , browser do not support python
Treat Python as a back-end language as far as web stuff is concerned. http://flask.pocoo.org 
Why we needed async vs a decorator.
It's worth having a look tat Repl.it It may require some changes to the deployment code or workflow but it's simple to use, new features are being added, and even the free plan provides unlimited servers. It's probably good enough for low-traffic demos or small apps.
If you're interested, Sanic is a web framework that is a lot like Flask but is asynchronous. ^Disclaimer, ^I ^am ^one ^of ^the ^core ^devs.
Thanks for the tip. I've actually seen this framework, because we're planning to move to async stuff at some point, and have been investigation our options. But we're in the early phase, and had to pick something we're all familiar with to meet time constraints.
&gt; look &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JavaScript in not Java ! Don't believe anyone said it was. 
I had a bit of a search and came across pyquery, why would it be a bad idea to use that?
How doesn't this lib work? I never heard of it and it seems interesting from what you explained here. (data scientist here too)
So which of your two apparently separate questions would you like an answer to then? The one about javascript or the one avout java?
An actual example with mock api and retrieving some text to print in console or something
Exactly how many lines of code did you think leftpad contained?
Wow it's frosty in here.. Im sure there's ways to code front end with python. But that will probably mean that some python code will generate js or react code for you. Bottom line im afraid it's css html5 react and bootstrap that's on the front end. Python is backend.. Check out Free code camp it's a complete and free course 
&gt;True. Are you advertising these new packages? Asking for contributions? Me? Yes. &gt;Does the package have a larger goal than one or two functions? If it's above 50 lines of code, yes. &gt;I was focusing on your 50 lines part and it made me think you were jumping to package creation instead of contributing to another existing project with similar goals as a first attempt. I think you've gone a bit off topic. 
Jeez! I'm agreeing with you. Lighten up! Your syntax **is** more readable. That's why the python developers included it. You see the `and` and `or` trick a lot in early python code, and it was ugly / hard to read. 
For web u have to think in 2 separates sets of languages backend and frontend For frontend: Javascript html and css are a must to web development. Also u can stack a js framework (angular, react, vue) For backend: (i don't want to start flame wars python vs java. For me python) Python, also the framework django is a good tool (not the unique, but my option) and also u need to know how to publish the site: linux commands, ngnix + uwsgi or gunicorn 
The best comparison I've got is that async programs work the way humans do, when interacting with others. A traditional single threaded (or single process) program does one thing, and when it's done that one thing, it can do the next. Having more than one process or thread lets you have multiple instances of it doing one thing at a time. If we're talking about humans, it's like having a team of people, each doing just one thing, and picking up a new task when the other is finished. Humans don't really work that way, though. I need a piece of information, so I ask a colleague on Slack. I don't sit there waiting for them to answer, I get on with something else while I'm waiting. If I get blocked again, I start doing a third thing. Whenever a task allows me to take a small break, I go and check on the others - ah, look, the first colleague has replied, so I can carry on with the first task. This is basically what asynchronous programs do. They have an event manager, which controls what's being worked on at any given point. The code itself has places in it which say "Yeah, I'm waiting now, something else can have a go if they want" and the event manager works that out. In well written libraries most of that is hidden from people writing applications. So if the program is doing task A, and that involves making a request over the network, the program doesn't sit there waiting for a response, doing nothing. Instead, it looks at what other bits of code it can run at the same time, and does those. Then it checks back to see if the network request has responded. You might think the network is fast, but it's only fast from a human point of view. For running code, it's really slow. There's a comparison chart of latency numbers every programmer should know. Here's a humanized version: [https://gist.github.com/hellerbarde/2843375](https://gist.github.com/hellerbarde/2843375) They've multiplied all the durations by 1 billion to get human-scale activities, so that comparisons make sense. If finding something in on-cpu memory takes as long as a heartbeat, then finding something in main memory takes as long as brushing your teeth; reading from an SSD takes nearly two days on this scale, and the time taken for a network packet to travel within the same building is nearly six days. You would expect a human to keep working on the same task if they just had to pick up a piece of paper from their desk, but you'd want them to do something else useful if they had to wait six days for an answer before carrying on. Async treats programs the same way. Mind you, this is mostly good for I/O. Once you've got the data and are doing a lot of CPU-intensive work, the benefits just aren't there. Other forms of parallel work are much better when processing power is the bottleneck. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Ok, so based on these responses... Let's say I'm training a model one data point at a time ("on-line"), and each successive value comes from a function call. Maybe it's just linear regression and for every new data point I need to update my regression line. * If the function call is slow, but each training step is fast, then I don't gain much from asyncio. * If the function call is fast, but each training step is slow, then I don't gain much from asyncio. * If the function call is slow and each training step is slow, then if the function is mostly idle (waiting for the network), I can get some training in on point n while I'm waiting for point n + 1 to be delivered, and I basically need either asyncio or threading for that (which one should I pick and why?).
Thank you 😁
Asking anybody who knows, how does this compare to https://mycroft.ai/, which is also written in python.

I think the `if` shows control flow so people parse it as such. The `or` is by default a boolean at for to all the people I've taught Python. I would hope there wouldn't be a need to bring together a bunch of values like that, based on designing not to do it. However, sometimes things just get messy. In your case, I have to agree that with more than two it is no contest on clean code. I still don't agree that everyone would grok it as fast.
That's very nice. I'll try to learn kore about it. I have a huge bottleneck on reading data that could use some speed up. Thank you!
I mostly work with Python, but I don't understand the complaints about JS. It used to suck years ago when it differed from browser to browser but not anymore. It is easy to learn if you already know Python. The javascript UI frameworks like React or Vue are really smart and better than anything in Python world. Python lack of better anonymous functions makes it unsuitable for interactive event-driven applications.
No prob.

Insert new prices update old prices all based on the MLS number
PythonAnywhere dev here -- just a quick note, you can host two web apps with moderate traffic for $7 -- the $12 plan has more power behind the websites and more CPU time per day than the $5 plan. Do do that, just click on the button for the "Hacker" plan and then bump the number of websites up to two in the customization window that appears. (As an aside, you're not the first person to be confused by this and we're going to improve the pricing table to make it clearer how it all works. We're just having ~~violent arguments~~ heated debates internally about how the new pricing page should look...)

Wrote a python to take a (large) file of email addresses and check them against haveibeenpwnd to see if they were compromised. It gives colorful output to the cli and simultaneously writes the return to a formatted CVS. I used it for companies that got worried about the "Collection#1" breach. There's some python apps already linked on haveibeenpwnd, but I couldn't get them to run in Python3, or they didn't actually do what I wanted.
TIL what the MLS# is for. Thanks again! What would you suggest to keep data so I can see what properties have had a price change? I'd like to see how it has changed over time. Would I just make a new entry with the same days but different price and date of entry to show the history?

Yep. There are situations where it is warranted [like in my comment example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aimo2c/til_the_real_behavior_of_or_expressions/eeqk5az/). But for the most part if you are doing it, it is a bug or making Python code that isn't very Pythonic.

[farc](https://github.com/dwhall/farc) lets you focus on solving concurrency problems by coding state machines rather than having to figure out asyncio and the related keywords.
How is that a raise?
Lost me at "voice controlled." Maybe I'm weird, but I will never understand why people want to talk to their technology.
&gt; comment every single line of your code. It makes your code understandable to literally everyone Commenting every line only adds noise to code that is either self-explanatory or should be rewritten to be so. Anything that needs further explanation, like use of the asyncio api, will likely need more space than a comment can provide, which is why you'd have the example contained within a larger web page. A comment like `i += 1 # increment i` is worse than no comment.
The only month that changes its February, so you can hard code other months and go check how many days February has in 2019. Or if you want a program that work for every year you need to check if the year is leap.

One thing that might be interesting is manipulation of the lists created with `os.walk`. I build up a zip file of code to distribute to clients that are otherwise network isolated. So I want file and directory level ignores, to not include everything from the directory in the zip. I did this by replacing the contents of the dirs list in place with `[:]`, rather than replacing it. If I did a replacement, it would only be for that look of `os.walk`. By replacing values in place, this affects how to `os.walk` proceeds and stops it from drilling down ignored dirs. with ZipFile(self.full_zip_path, "x") as zf: for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.config.code_folder): dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in self.config.ignore_folders] filtered_files = [f for f in files if f not in self.config.ignore_files] for file_name in filtered_files: relative_path = pathlib.PurePath(root, file_name).relative_to( self.config.code_folder ) zf.write(relative_path)

Honestly, I find it unlikely that you’ll ever really need it as a data scientist. The problem async solves is that OS threads are too heavy to waste on concurrent IO in eg a web server. But for data science you are mostly processing single files from top to bottom. That file might be multiple gigabytes but it’s just one file, so threading doesn’t come into it at all, and async doesn’t buy you anything but a lot of boilerplate. It’s only worthwhile if you’re opening a few hundred or thousand files. 
I agree. I meant: comment every single line of code that uses sth from asyncio.
Not really just one file. I have about 8640 files each day to process
Yeah, this is correct. Async is just one form of multitasking and not even a particularly general one. Data science is much more likely to benefit from SIMD than async. 
The swap points for single threaded asyncio are explicit, but you can still create a race by putting the sync points in the wrong place. It’s just harder to do by mistake and slightly easier to do correctly. Of course if you do multithreaded async you’re back to race condition hell. 
&gt; Why use it over multiprocessing? Because the multiprocessing package requires all callables or data that are passed between the processes to be picklable. &gt; Why use it over multithreading? The potential for deadlocks. Apart from that, with threading on Python it's easy to write code which, while technically parallelized, is slower than if you did things sequentially. &gt; How does the consistency model function? Only one thing happens at once. If a piece of code needs something from a potentially blocking operation, it can "await" the result, yielding execution to the interpreter who can then process whatever other asynchronous pieces of code aren't blocked.

I've recently been looking for the answer to that question, and to answer it, you need to understand the role of HTML, CSS, Javascript, how servers and server-side languages work, and how browsers work. This is my first attempt at summarising it: Generally speaking, HTML manages the elements that make up the page (text and HTML structures), CSS controls how they're laid out on the screen and how they look, and Javascript provides the interactivity by managing dynamic "events". As far as I know, web browsers are only really capable of understanding HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. When a user goes to a webpage, their browser triggers a "request", and in "response" the server delivers code, which the browser interprets and understands as HTML, CSS and JS code. In the most basic kind of page with limited interactivity, a flat HTML file with no Javascript, the server delivers a text file that's written in HTML and maybe CSS. There's a file on the server, and that is the exact same code that gets delivered to the browser. While CSS can make a webpage slightly adaptive (eg. by resizing if the browser width changes), generally speaking, without Javascript, the page the user sees is static. If they want to change the content, they have to make a new "request" to the server, and have it send over a new lot HTML and CSS (ie. a new page). This is what happens when you type in a URL, or click on a link. This is called a "GET" request, and is the most common type of request. Generally speaking, you'll see a different URL every time you see different content. Javascript enables you to change elements in the HTML or CSS without making a new request. ie. you can change parts of a webpage, by programming dynamic "events", without needing the browser having to reload all of the HTML, CSS and Javascript again. Because a user's browser is capable of executing Javascript code, they can do this without making any requests for the server to do it. So far, we've been talking about having a static back-end (ie. fully written text files on our server for our HTML, CSS and JS), and a dynamic front-end, which, with Javascript, can change what that HTML and CSS has (with events and functions, similar to Python.) If you were to send Python code, eg. a function, to a browser window, the browser simply wouldn't know what to do with it. It can only understand HTML, CSS and JS. Now, the other part of the equation is what happens on the back-end: server-side scripting. As stated, you could have every web page represented by a static file, and simply serve a file every time a differet URL request asks for it. Far more common (and useful) is to have dynamic servers, which can create custom and dynamic web-pages by using back end-code, and maybe storing information in a database like MySQL. By using server-side scripting, the server can create web-pages (HTML, CSS and JS) on the fly, based on parameters it gets from the user. Fortunately (?), unlike browsers (which are limited to understanding HTML, CSS and JS), you can install just about any programming language on servers. This means that you could use Python, or Ruby, or Java, or PHP, or Javascript (which can also be used as a back-end language) to generate the webpage that gets sent through to the browser. It gets information for this from a number of places - like the URL, or from information in the "header" of the request. However, once the server has followed instructions and sent it to the browser, all it's sending is HTML, CSS and JS. None of the server-side scripting ends up in what gets sent to the browser - it all happens behind-the-scenes. So to answer your question, no, I don't think you can use Python in the places where you use Javascript, because only Javascript can control elements in the browser and react to what the user is doing dynamically (without generating an entirely new page). However, you could use Javascript to interact with Python (eg. clicking on this word tells the server to run a Python script), but remember, it can only send back HTML, CSS and JS. If anyone who knows any better can point out anything I've gotten wrong, please do. Still learning for myself. Happy to clear up any further questions.
Because the Python language devs are bad at planning. 
I'm just so bored of these low-effort questions asked by people who would rather inflict their willful ignorance on the rest of us than spend 30 seconds of their own effort. I left /r/learnpython because of it; I enjoyed helping out with new concepts and crafting didactic examples and so on but too much of it was just entitled idiots not bothering to throw a couple of lines through a REPL. I want to stay keyed into the python community and hear about interesting libraries and projects and language news and fun corner cases, but at least 50% of posts on /r/Python are exactly the same bullshit, if not *worse* because if someone posts such a question here, you know for a fact that they haven't even put in the effort to look at the sidebar, so the chance of them looking at any documentation or a REPL is slim to none. My post may not have been gentle, but it wasn't overly belligerent, and it contained the solution, the relevant documentation lines, how to solve similar problems in the future, *and* the link to /r/learnpython, as well as impressing on the poster that attempting to solve your own problems is more effective in terms of time spent and community discussion.

The multiprocessing package definitely has all sorts of applications in data science. I guess all the CUDA/GPU computations rely on SIMD too, but knowing the actual mechanics of how that works is above my pay grade.
Hi there Thelma. &amp;#x200B; Did you know there is a subreddit for learning Python? It is called /r/learnpython It's full of friendly people ready to help you, but there's one thing they hate to do... make your homework for you. So when you post your question in /r/learnpython, also post the code you already wrote and describe what you struggle with (what is not working in your code, what error do you get, ...) &amp;#x200B; Have fun!
I understand your frustration, though it could be worse; 50% of the posts on r/rust are about a video game _and then_ there's the people asking trivial questions they could answer themselves with a minimal amount of effort. At least most of the posts on here aren't about a particular kind of snake or a humor troupe composed entirely of senior citizens. That said there's a lot to be said for dropping the belligerence -- of which there was _loads_ -- because the helpful portion of your post was completely lost in the noise. It takes _much_ less effort to simply flag the post and let the admins deal with it than it does to type an 80% screed / 20% answer that's dripping with disdain. In the end if it's not worth your time to reply civilly then it certainly isn't worth your time to reply un-civilly.
Python is slow (or more specifically, CPython is slow) because making it fast is not a priority for the development team. Their focus is on keeping the codebase readable and maintainable, with performance being something they'll only tackle if it doesn't make other things worse. PyPy *is* focused in making Python fast, and gives the JVM-based languages a run for their money in tests. You'll notice that PyPy lags behind CPython in development speed (the newest version is compatible with CPython 3.5.3, whereas the latest CPython is 3.7.2), but the interpreter uses every trick in the book to get more speed out of the CPU. I'm not sure whether the lag in feature support in PyPy is because of the difficulty of adding features to PyPy (PyPy a complex beast - they do an admirable job keeping the core of it comprehensible, but CPython's code is readable to the point of being didactic), or because it has a smaller core development team, or even just a preference for letting new features "bed in" before implementing them.
Ohhhh - so it's like a way of a thread "relinquishing priority"? Makes sense, thanks! 
Informational checks across our network. I'm a Network Admin for an enterprise with 3 data centers, a dozen satellite offices, and a few smaller campuses. I'm working towards using Python for configuration, instead of just information collection, but it's kinda slow going as I'm also studying IPv6 presently
If you’re doing small things, urllib and math are simpler and add fewer dependencies. I really don’t get the hate for unittest. You still have to make classes if you want to group tests to make them callable from an all_tests script. For a few tests pytest is better, but for 700+, it seems about the same.
&gt; IPv6 This is a really interesting answer, and it sounds like a worthwhile use case! 
Why are you downloading 64 bit libraries for 32 but python. Seriously, nobody should use 32 bit python. 2GB of RAM makes python a toy.
I've found that when you have lots of tests, composable fixtures are a must. Tests can be grouped in a module. I've never needed an all_tests script because pytest's discovery is so much better than unittest's. The biggest thing, though, and the reason that I always recommend starting with pytest, is that it uses what is fundamentally a better testing paradigm than unittest. The xUnit pattern was designed for a language designed in the 60s with many more constraints than python. We are hamstringing ourselves by unnecessarily conforming to that. urllib is absolutely not simpler than requests, from a user perspective. Numpy isn't a bad recommendation for someone who has just explicitly asked which third-party libraries they should look into.
I work in Help Desk so coding isn't necessarily a requirement but it's a big interest/enjoyable hobby for me. The company I work for offers a dedicated Slack Channel to our customers that have the highest tiered plan with us. We use two Slack Workspaces, our internal Workspace and the external one that the customers are invited to. We create the dedicated Channel on our side after receiving a Jira ticket request to create the channel with our internal naming convention, invite roughly 30 of my company's employees, then share it with the external Workspace and rename it to the customer's company name, send out e-mail invites to the external Workspace and then post a welcome message to the external Workspace channel as SlackBot. Then update/comment on the Jira ticket and move it to another Project within Jira. &amp;#x200B; After doing this process a few times manually I quickly started working to automate it using a few libraries like slackclient, jira, selenium (Slack's API \*does not\* have a way to share Slack channels between Workspaces unfortunately), and beautifulsoup. Now all it takes to complete is the Jira ticket's ticket number and the e-mail addresses to send the external Workspace channel invites too. It went from \~20+ minutes to less than 2 minutes.

&gt; It doesn't even support elif That's a very fair criticism. For full disclosure (this is at the end of the README), it doesn't support elif, break, continue, short-circuit and/or evaluation, or closures. With the possible exception of closures, none of these are hugely difficult to implement. We just haven't had time given the challenge of implementing other features. But we hope to finish at least Python minus classes in the next month or so. &gt; I will look into collaborating/contributing to such a project. We'd really be happy to have contributions. The code is rather well documented, and there are implementation details on the README. The only challenge is that most of it is written in OCaml, which is not most people's first language. It's great for typed languages, but not for inviting contributions. 
That's awesome. Just out of curiosity, where does beautifulsoup come in here? It's actually the only library you mentioned that I'm familiar with. I'm just wondering what has to be scraped? 
I'm a computational plasma physics PhD student (probably a year out from defending). My main project uses a big Python framework developed by another DOE project to handle high-performance code coupling (essentially, we're doing "Python as glue" between Fortran, C, and C++ codes on supercomputers). I also use Python to quickly prototype new numerical methods - it's a wonderful prototyping tool. Data analysis, automating simulations, making input files for ancient Fortran codes, and easy plotting are also on the list.

Thing 1: [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html). You're welcome. Thing 2: I'm not sure how general it is, but Google tells me that PyMC3 has some [BMA capabilities](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/model_averaging.html). Have you looked at this? Thing 3: You're clearly coming from a statistics background (or some kind of "-metrics"). I did too, so I remember spending time wondering why `sklearn` wouldn't give me the goddamn standard error on my linear regression and thinking it was stupid. That said... * Data science is *mostly not statistics*. If your goal is to *only do classical statistics*, then yes, Python is outclassed by R and probably also ye olde stats packages (STATA, SAS, Minitab, etc.). Also, as much as it pains me to say it, `dplyr` makes `pandas` look like the third world. * Data science is *highly interdisciplinary*. Nobody makes serious software in R. Nobody does web development in R. Nobody does hard science in R. Don't even get me started on the other packages. If you want to learn about almost any field adjacent to data science, which is necessary to do data science well, Python will be your friend. * Python's ML capabilities are still way ahead of R. R is a second-class citizen in ML land. As for STATA... lol. I ditched R for Python a few years ago, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. I'm working as a data scientist now and trust me, there's way less ANOVA out here in the real world than there is in school ;)
I think it's a play on the word [calliope](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/calliope).

Two levels to "smart" tech. You can get sensors to turn on/off when you walk into the room, but sometimes you don't want it to be turning on/off during movement. So you have to put in some effort to have smarter rules about motion sensing, which maybe is a bit too much of an effort. You can also have your voice activate things, which gives you the benefit of handsless light activation but without the hassle of trying to figure out rules for the automation. Why do you want handsless activation? Because you can come into your living place with two hands full of heavy bags and have lights on in all the rooms you need to bring the bags to.
This sounds like a really cool use case. I don't do anything with other languages, but lately I've been interested in building pipelines between different notebooks and scripts. 
yep: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope)
There are actually three complementary approaches, represented by: &amp;#x200B; \- Transcrypt: Precompiles Python to JavaScript modules in advance during development. Browser just loads generated code. \- Brython: Compiles Python to JavaScript after loading a page. Browser first loads compiler and then does the compilation and runs the generated code. \- PyPyJs: Runs original Python VM in the browser. &amp;#x200B; Which approach you best depends on the type of problem, demands made on page-load time and code size, ease of use etc..
What is the TTS engine?
The Jira ticket is initially created by a submitted Google Form that dumps the raw HTML from the form in the Description field of the Jira ticket. I use beautifulsoup to parse the HTML and strip the characters I don't need from it to fix the Description as well as grab some unique identifying information from the Description field and feed it into an internal database for pulling more information from the customer (like the customer's company name) which is then used to name the dedicated channel I'm creating.
Why should I use this over Watchtower?
Hi there, I'm not the best python programmer, but it sounds like you need selenium. Selenium can login for you, and pull info from a java-script heavy site. It's been awhile, but the way I used it was to use Selenium Chromedriver to automate going to a website, then instead of using requests, I used one of selenium's functions to pull the source data which mitigates the javascript in a javascript heavy site. I then parsed it normally with BS4. This thread gives a small example of what I'm talking about: https://python-forum.io/Thread-Combining-selenium-and-beautifulsoup-for-web-scraping
Ohhhhh, ok. That makes perfect sense. 
Text To Speech
Ah, yes, that workflow does sound a lot better. I can see how monitoring will be improved when you can set the level of logging that triggers notifications.

Thank you so much for the awesome tip. I did actually see people using selenium but I didn't think it can't be used in such a way. I shall review the link and give it a try.
Could you extract the code with nbconvert or something and then work directly with the resulting .py file? I feel like that would make life easier for you.
Pick a book and finish it. 
Is there a second edition of Fluent Python?
If. Every other case goes the other way and I've seen many more setdefaults with lists than with ints, because a fair share of counting problems is already covered by collections.Counter
Taking a step back, I'd like to know when it's appropriate to use various "speed ups", like multi-process, multi-threading, and asyncio. Perhaps that's more of a general programming topic, not sure.
No, it’s very unlikely. Python’s been around for a lot of time, it’s extremely popular, and it’s unlikely that such a bug could’ve survived for so long. Please post a minimal complete example that reproduces the issue
&gt; I think that 'a or b is True' can only evaluate to (literal boolean) True if a is the literal value 'True' (or an expression that evaluates to True) &gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = 0, True &gt;&gt;&gt; a or b is True True 
Nice pictures, but there's a category error: you are not working with file system any more than you are working with a browser when all you do is running some JavaScript animation on an HTML page displayed in a browser. I.e. when I hear "working with filesystem" I imagine operations like resizing it, querying it for the details of its state, like fragmentation, encryption, content duplication, content compression, content encryption, how much cache is it using, is it creating a snapshot right now?, how many files are open right now, how many files are being written to right now, how many files are locked right now, what is the minimal block size, what is optimal block size and so on... What you do is you work with files and directories, i.e. you work with the services provided by the filesystem, but you don't really work with filesystem. (You don't even really talk to filesystem when you do it, you talk to Python, which talks to the OS kernel. For all you know, you might have never hit the filesystem at all if, say, you deleted all the files you worked with before calling `sync`).
Based on the (minimal) information available, my guess is that it fails if the file is empty. In that case the _for_ loop will stop immediately without assigning anything to _line_. For example: $ python3 Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 12 2018, 13:43:14) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; for x in []: pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; x Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'x' is not defined 
I love that we now have multiple efforts towards these kinds of technologies, there's this one, [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) which also does hardware, and [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io/). Soon enough my finances will recover again enough to be able to build one of these things and actually start working towards having my own JARVIS without having to settle for a 1984 telescreen.

`asyncio` doesn't help you with files at all. Python doesn't know how to do asynchronous file I/O. `asyncio` is *only* for TCP/UDP sockets.
How's support of different languages? I really wanted to use some locally hosted hackable voice assistant like Mycroft or this, but had to write my own to support working in multiple languages (Eng, Rus in my case). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It cost him everything.
No. Python has no way of reading files in a non-blocking way, and `asyncio` will not help you there. Either write your code in another language, which gives you access to system calls, and do asynchronous file I/O that way, or use threads (that'll be more wasteful, and slower, but still better than sequential reads).
How is this even relevant to `asyncio`? You are actually saying that you need to do something else, like, use threads or processes... there's no benefit of using `asyncio` in this situation.

For TTS, which is having the machine talk, as far as i know the most natural sounding are all cloud-based, which means you send all to a third-party to render into voice. I do know there were good attempts at solving this but i haven't kept up with it for a while so i don't know how well they work these days, but if you don't care much about making them sound natural anc can cope with an obviously machine voice, they're more than enough for now. Now, for STT, which is voice recognition, besides CMU Sphinx (which last i checked wasn't very accurate, no idea how much they've advanced lately), each one of the other choices are cloud-based, which means sending all of your audio to a third-party. This is what you *do not* want if you care about privacy. On the other hand i faintly recall that one of the other assistant engine projects was working with a Tensorflow solution that performed decently, maybe it could be included into this.

If all you're trying to do it read HTML tables from web pages, it might be worthwhile for you to take a look at Pandas. It has a function called `read_html` that is very good at reading HTML tables. It will read and parse the HTML tables directly into DataFrame data structures for you. It's as simple as: ``` import pandas as pd tables = pd.read_html("https://yoururl.com/pagename") print(tables[0]) ``` You will need to look into Pandas and the DataFrame objects but it's a quick and dirty way to extract the tables if that's all you need. If you're looking to parse other parts of the page, you're probably going to want to stick with beautiful soup. HTH.
I just want to see if others are following the ways of the noble bears, plus a good way to practice Python while I learn C.
How does perform CMUsphinx? I heard that kaldi is far more accurate [1]. What did drive your choices? [1]: http://suendermann.com/su/pdf/oasis2014.pdf
I'm looking for a solution that will address coverage overlap across the entire code-base. Your suggestion would of course work fine if there was one specific method or function I was trying to check.
It's a big problem because if say 10 tests all cover the same function in some capacity, then changing the function requires updating 10 tests. It often takes longer to write and update our tests than it does to make changes to the actual business logic.
The issue is two fold: 1. From a philosophical point of view, each unit test should cover a single piece of functionality. 2. When a lot of tests overlap the same business logic, changing that logic requires updating all of the tests. This is very time consuming.
It can also be quicker, than the most convenient GUIs. For example is set my alarm by a single voice command instead of starting an alarm app, chosing the right time and turning it on.
What about https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles ?
But would they benefit from being open simultaneously?
Nice write-up. Some suggestions: &gt; Note that if I hadn’t closed “f” in the above example, the output wouldn’t have arrived in the file. That’s because Python buffers all output by default; whenever you write to a file, the data is only actually written when the buffer fills up (and is flushed), when you invoke the “flush” method explicitly, or when you close the file, and thus flush implicitly. I'm not sure if that's always the case, but either way I think that's a bit too in the weeds for your target audience. I'd probably change the example to something like: &gt;&gt;&gt; with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f: ... print('hello') ... print('hello???', file=f) ... print('hello again') hello hello again &gt;&gt;&gt; print(open('myfile.txt').read()) hello??? ... and just leave out the discussion of flushing. &gt; The answer is that “sys.stdout” is treated specially by Python. It's not. [`open` takes an argument named `buffering`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) where you can pass 0 to turn buffering off, 1 for line buffering or a larger integer for using a buffer of `buffering` bytes. The default is to use a buffer of a system-dependent number of bytes, _unless_ the file is opened in text-mode and is connected to a terminal. This means that normally `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are line-buffered, but if you redirect them to a file or a pipe, they will be buffered like any other file. It also means that you can open any text file in a line-buffered mode. You also may want to note that Python 2's `print "Hello",` is equivalent to Python 3's `print("Hello", end=" ")` and to use `print("Hello", end='')` with Python 2 syntax you need to call `sys.stdout.write("Hello")` instead.
Did you tried OpenCV?

Half of everything.
Yes. So that I could build a huge data structure containing information about each of those files.
Not sure why you're downvoted. I feel the same way. Only place I use voice control is in my car, which is where I would want something like this, but then the whole cloud-based STT and TTS goes out the window.

I am actually going to learn to program with Invent you own games with Python. I say actually learn because I have started and stopped numerous times, but this time I’m sticking with it! 
From that error, it looks like you can have the latest version of Python (3.7.2) installed. You can [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from the Python site.
Unpopular opinion, I guess. Mainly, I don't like it because it's so much less efficient than just pressing a button or typing a command. But then, I'm a Linux guy, and most of my time is spent in terminals. It's so much better to be able to enter an explicit command in that way. Speech is so unreliable. When I talk to my phone, I always wind up correcting what it thought I said. Takes forever to get something done, and it requires me to press buttons anyway.
True :) `a` has to be `True` or `b` has to be `True`. Which means that despite being interpreted differently, `a or b is True` produces the exact same results as `(a or b is True)` for all inputs. Yay for hidden bugs. def test1(a, b): return a or b is True def test2(a, b): return (a or b) is True res1 = [test1(a, b) for a in (True, False) for b in (True, False)] res2 = [test2(a, b) for a in (True, False) for b in (True, False)] assert res1 == res2 
I think it's nice to organize things as a tree where each layer is responsible for doing cleanup of its children. Which is what trio enforces. So yeah with asyncio that's means that you need to hold a reference or await/gather all tasks you create. 
This needs way more upvotes, I would love this!
Also who needs friends when you can talk to your computer? “Hey Kalliope, remember that inside joke we came up with a couple weeks ago?” “Memory cache cleared every two weeks, no non-essential user data before 1/9/19.” “Haha yeah... good times. Good times...” *slowly weeps*
Typically you do this as part of a larger async application where you need to do some slow sync operations. 
I would probably just remove duplicate coverage at the time of updating the business logic.
What I'm looking for is a tool or method with which to see which lines in our code-base each test covers, highlighting duplication. I'm sure there are entire unit tests that can just be removed outright.
I thought that was the point in naming it as such...
&gt; Any suggestions? Read the sidebar and post things like this in the much more appropriate sub listed therein.
I'd like to offer a few thoughts on this. Skip Down to the Line Break if You're not interested in the history, or skip it all if you don't want anything personal. It's a thank you to Python 2, and I hope that my words will encourage even one person to give it a try no matter how good or bad you are at programming. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\* &amp;#x200B; First, I'd like to say hello, as I have never posted in the subreddit before, and really haven't spent much time lurking either. Nevertheless, Python 2 was the language that shaped me as a human being. I won't go into extreme detail, but over a decade ago, I was a worthless piece of shit. Bad enough of one that the lawmen of a southern state would soon think so too, but that's another story. Needless to say, I would later spend quite some time alone, thinking. Up until that point in time, I'd hated programming. I took a course in C++ in high school, and the teacher had a grudge against me. She had a right to have one, too. I skipped her Algebra II class so often that I took it from freshman until senior year when she finally demanded I be transferred to a new class. Wouldn't you know it, they transferred me to C++, and she also taught that very same class. Despite her rightful hatred of me, I had begun to realize what a scumbag I was, and I ventured to stop skipping class, and pay attention. She taught me nothing, but I didn't care and I knew I deserved it - I really did - this isn't some boohoo fucking pity party. I skipped so much that she stopped calling truancy officers because I wasn't worth her time - and I really wasn't. In the end, I hated that piece of shit class, and I hated it passionately, but my judgment was clouded and in the haze of rage and conflict stirring within me, I achieved a C+ in C++, all while having duplicate classes of every other subject also due to skipping. (IE, 11/12 History, 11/12 Science, 11/12 Spanish, C++ and Governor's School English.) (I had been removed from all high achiever classes save the English, as it was a matter of passion for me at that time.) In the end I graduated. And while in community college, a horrible thing happened. A death of a woman pregnant with my child. I fear the rest is irrelevant here, save for the path it helped it set me upon. A path of self-destruction, incarceration, and ultimately, a resilience that I would never have found under other circumstances. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\* After my debt to society was paid, I began waiting tables and as soon as I could, I bought a laptop. `GOOGLE:` **How can I code a fortune teller like Zoltan from** ***"Big"***? `RESULTS:`**Code a fortune teller in Python** [**2.xxx**](https://2.xxx)**!!!** And honestly, that was over 10 years ago. From that first project, even though I followed the words of another, I had stopped putting my faith in defeat, and realized I could do all this shit on my own. I never once understood a for loop during that C++ class. I spent weeks on it, and whether it was my own shitty attitude or something else I can't say. This time around, I was only in my early 20s and, with each documentation page of the python manual, I would take notes that I just knew were important - I saw the potentials for their use. I couldn't just make a fortune teller, I could use this cool thing, called "Tkiktitkter" ;) (That's bad form for new readers, the module is "Tkinter" - I remember the spelling by saying "t + "k + "interception" - CEPTION"
Then recite e.e. cummings poetry...

Make sure you are calling the module correctly! If you are using a function from the module be sure to use “random.function(x)” or to specifically import that function with “from random import function” and then use “function(x)”. That error appears when you try to use “random(x)” which will not work since you have not specified a function.

I've encountered this issue myself. What the dependencies are makes a lot of difference, since some dependencies (like PyQT) come with tons of baggage that can't be stripped out arbitrarily. What libraries are you using?
Hello, Im a systems engineer. You should never have only one instance of your app as you should always have failover. HA is also a concern but that is secondary to having a backup instance for your customers to use in case the first goes down. Ideally multiple app instances behind a load balancer (and security appliance) is what you want. As for DB, I would recommend separate tables for each client with at least 2 DB instances, its up to you to set replication scheme. Again you want failover capability. Once you grow larger you can then have multiple DB's if you'd like. As long as the API 's endpoints are setup properly the only thing limiting the ability to serve multiple clients would be the host/infrastructure. Not much of a frontend guy (I do whats necessary for my apps ) so someone else may want to chime in on anything angular specific
MOAR features
But then my AI would be charmingly fond of speaking in plot terms, like "Sokovia's going for a ride," or "You might want to smell around the kitchen. Something may be burning."
Thank you for your response. You say multiple instances of the app behind a loaf balancer. Isn't that done by the hosting provider like AWS automatically ? Having separate tables would work for now. I guess we will go ahead with this idea. We will use the same schema with multiple tables. Each table identified by its tenant_id+table_name. Also, can you please elaborate a bit on the replication bit ? I have never done it before mainly because we never built any application that attracted enough traffic for us to consider having DB backups. How does db replication work ? Do we just create SQL scripts that access the live DB and mass replicate data from it to a backup DB at regular intervals of times ?? 
&gt; I've never needed an all_tests script because pytest's discovery is so much better than unittest's. I have multiple levels of tests. There's an all_tests that you could get rid of, there are also all_tests_of module_a and all_tests_of_module_a_with subcomponent_b. Sometimes the tests are located in subdirectories and sometimes they are not. I guess what I'm saying is I don't need/want test discovery. I don't want to type extra things to find specific tests. I'd rather run a file. I do like the better asserts though. &gt; urllib is absolutely not simpler than requests That's kind of irrelevant if all you're doing is reading a single url and you don't want to add a dependency. For a basic task, there's no appreciable difference. Same with numpy vs. math regarding sin/cos. I love numpy and always import it in a project. I'm an engineer, so yeah. Most people are software oriented vs. math oriented. If you really care about numpy, you'll use the MKL libraries, which come with Anaconda (on Windows) and are a 140 MB dependency, but is 5x faster. That's a hard pill to swallow, when my entire PyQt, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, VTK executable can fit into 68 MB.
When bs4 fetches the website the react only generates the rest of the html once the javascript run in the browser. That's why you need to use a Selenium like program to emulate the browser the run the js and render the full page.
In the script I use network related libraries, pycrypto, os libraries and some others, but problem is in the one directory I encounter some I don't use at all, like Pillow which is weird because I have nothing image related in the script...

I do a lot of image editing and file/folder management using Python. It’s perfect for when I need to do a small edit to a few thousand images or need to change the format of a bunch of files all at once. The image libraries are great and the community is so helpful because everyone shares their projects. Whenever there is a file that I can’t seem to read/write I can always search it on github and someone has inevitably written a small module for it.
Not yet but I'll look into it.

so far, i’m about 20% into the book, the combination between theoretical and practical information is the best there is; thanks to the author understanding and using concepts is easy . The author starts with introducing a number of interesting core concepts that strongly relates with the purpose book. In my past comment, my comments wasn’t to imply that there are somethings missing; rather to imply that the book have the minimal amount of information that gets a beginner (such as me ) up and running with TDD or in my case managing dev teams and making key workflow decisions. So far it has the best introduction to software design or development. I feel that anyone with business analysis/development position would benefit a lot from reading such a wonderful book; without needing an expert to further explain.

Can you give us a list of all the imports that you have in your script?

Hi. Like others have said, Selenium is a good way of handling this issue. I actually did my first python program with Selenium yesterday, and ran into this exact issue. I had to wait until a field was populated by a Javascript. [This is the way I solved it](https://github.com/syntaxgnu/adtractionnotify/blob/master/provisiongetter.py) The code in question is in the while loop starting at line 35. Btw, you might get better answers if you post in r/learnpython/
/u/crabbone may be unaware that terms can have differing meanings dependant on the context. The term 'filesystem' or 'file system' is often used in the way this post uses it, especially in the context of high level languages, and does not always mean the physical filesystem.

Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions! I teach Python about 20 days each month, and my students tend to be C programmers who are obsessed with when files are flushed and closed. So I figured that adding that would answer some questions from at least some of the population. I might do some rewriting there, though. As for "buffering" -- my first reaction was: Yes, yes, I mentioned the "buffering" parameter. Then I checked, and I hadn't! Whoops! I'll definitely make some edits and re-add that. I would still argue that sys.stdout is treated specially, but it's "specially" in the sense of "not the usual buffering." Good points, as well, about the Python 2 equivalents. Thanks again!
The main thing was being able have debug messages that I can leave in the codebase and simply hide them in the production environment.
I am working as a devops engineer. I wrote bunch of scripts that are triggered by Jenkins. The scripts scan a few docker registries of companies that write software for us. When the scripts find a new image they get pulled, retagged and pushed into our own registry. After that I generate docker-compose files from templates, save them in git and deploy the new images to our test environment. The next script does some api calls to the microservices to evaluate if the whole application is still working correctly. When the test succeeds the new container gets deployed to acceptation. Of the deployment in test, the test results and promotion to acceptation messages are sent into a slack channel so the devs and management can see what happens. Before I joined the team my colleagues were doing this by hand. Sometimes more than 20 times a day. They made typo's and other f'ups and sometimes were busy and forgot to do it while people were waiting for their stuff to be deployed. Now we have a dependable pipeline that works like a clock and never fails. Also I now get to do interesting things like automating other boring stuff.
That sounds disgustingly bad and trivially gamed.
[kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) is the best open source solution for these things, especially when you require a balance between speed and accuracy, and have constraints on the availability of training data. There is also a server for it, [kaldi-gstreamer](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server). Unfortunately it is pretty complicated to use, which I guess is why you see it everywhere in ASR research, but not so much in these toolkits.

I heard that you can, but I’m using it in a notebook. Do you have any problem at runtime? I am just starting off with plotly, didn’t even know all about matplot, just plotting functions.
You're describing [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)). Good luck with that.
You're welcome! Re: flushing: in that case, I'd definitely point out where Python helps ensuring things get flushed, although some rewording might make that clearer, especially for readers without that C background. And I'd say that sys.stdout is not treated specially -- any file that happens to be connected to a TTY and is opened in text mode is treated that way, it's just that stdout and stderr are the two only files most users will see that satisfy that condition. ;)

Although there might be a lot sure, why not requests, errno, os, multiprocessing, pickle, urllib.request, re, time, collections, concurrent.futures, hashlib, base64, Crypto, Crypto.Cipher, Crypto.Util, ssl, math, colorama, bs4, html.parser, lxml, tqdm some are referenced directly in the script and some are referenced in 3 other python files that I import to the main script to use like a module. 
I work for a company with a SaaS product and we do things exactly like this. 6 servers but 3 can take the load in case it's needed and no5 and 6 is mainly used for seamless deployment for new versions. Each of them has an instance of the platform installed. And we have separare db instances for each client too.
Download Anaconda and use that. You said it's a data science conference not a programming conference right? They're probably familiar with Anaconda.
Context manager (with) is a good one to reach to C programmers. It doesn't really have anything like that and they'll need to get used to it. Explict open/close makes me sad when I see it in Python.
So many articles jump directly into set up without explaining what exactly is accomplished through using whatever it is about. I feel like this is true about company websites as well.
I'm a PhD student in a quantum optics/Rydberg physics group. All our computations are done in Python. In addition we develop some tools and frameworks to control and manage our cold atom experiments (imagine a 60m^2 room filled to the brim with lasers, optics and electronics all supporting a central vacuum chamber).
i try it on pip? but... *No matching distribution found for libasound2-dev* 
?? What You need to install alsa lib dependencies in your distro, use apt-get in the terminal Open the terminal and type `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev`
&gt; I've requested Beta Access to a specific Google Docs API made by Google but I'm also looking for other solutions. I've requested access to that. But you never know, maybe someone already has a functional wrapper or an other way of doing this :o, hence my thread.
&gt; But then, I'm a Linux guy, and most of my time is spent in terminals. It's so much better to be able to enter an explicit command in that way. I am a Linux guy too. The commands you need to type into a terminal aren't the commands this kind of technology is good for. &gt; Mainly, I don't like it because it's so much less efficient than just pressing a button or typing a command. LOL, no. Scenario: Walk into the kitchen to do some chore that will take a little while, so want to listen to music/current_news/weather_report/latest_sports_scores/whatever. Your way (and my old way): Walk to the stereo. Turn on. Adjust volume. Switch away from Home Theater mode/DiscPlayer/whatever to Tuner. Find station you want - hopefully preset. That's for radio, and you have to listen to whatever is on. For on-demand, you have to insert a disc, activate your streaming device, pick the channel, etc. For information, you have to go to your computer, login, bring up browser, type in search, read results of search etc. For listening to music or news, you have to launch the player, find the music/news/streaming_service you want, select that. Finally, you go back to the kitchen and start your chore. When done, you have to go back to the stereo/computer turn off whatever you started up for the duration of the chore. My current way: Walk into kitchen to do chore. Realize I want to listen to something. While starting chore, I say the magic word to activate the 'genie'. Then I say what I want: "Play &lt;radio station name&gt;" or "Play my &lt;named playlist&gt;" or "What's the weather for the next 3 hours?" or any of a number of commands that give me information or otherwise pretty instantly. Each command takes only as long as it takes me to speak it and I can issue commands *while* I'm doing my task rather than stopping, breaking my flow and walking to where the button or keyboard is. When I'm done, I just say 'genie, stop' and walk away. No need for explicit shutdown of appliances or applications. Which is more efficient? It doesn't work for all tasks, such as reading this subreddit or typing this response, but instant access to voice commands has added to the things I can do with technology *in addition to* what I already can. It's an additive technology that enables new workflows alongside current ones. Your point about communicating with a remote server is a valid one, but that's why tools like this exist - to give you an alternative where that doesn't happen.
Automate some Tasks you do regularily, eg: - write a program where you can store login credentials, which then opens a browser and logs you in directly. - write a web crawler to find information for you Or make a game. Or your own chat server. Or a reddit bot. 
Check out "Automate The Boring Stuff" for some useful projects that might be related to everyday things you do online.
One thing you can try with PyInstaller is selectively excluding libraries. Some advice here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17034434/how-to-remove-exclude-modules-and-files-from-pyinstaller and here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4890159/python-excluding-modules-pyinstaller/17595149#17595149
&gt; (probably a year out from defending) ooopp ya jinxed it ;-)
I have thought about this but I think it's not a good solution since python has much much more libraries that I don't use that those that I do... It'd be extremely inefficient. 
Django game? Interesting. Is it a text adventure or something of the sort?
I’m a sysadmin and I use Python for reporting, Slack alerts, automating AWS stuff, or creating workaround since some services of AWS are limited (like CodePipeline not supporting Bitbucket out of the box). Most of my scripts are deployed to Lambda using Serverless Framework.
Find something you like doing that can benefit from Python so you can integrate it in your hobbies. Build games, make a web app, do some image processing, track sport stats, anything you are interested in. Many of these may seem daunting at the beginning but struggling for weeks or months on a hard project is a great learning experience and really prepares you to tackle larger projects in the future. Choosing a project all depends on your on interests. Make sure you will be excited by what you start working on, this will motivate you when the project gets hard.
Separate out each tenant in its own database. Always have backups (note plural)! I would read a bit more about security and application / server administration as based on your questions you don’t sound like you know what you are doing. And losing customers data or worse, getting a data breach (check GDPR fine limits) will most likely put you out of business.

What are your hobbies? I've found that's a good place to start, since not only is the code going to be useful, but it's easy to come up with new features. For example, I do tabletop RPGs. I made a bunch of scripts to help me out as a GM. As I've used them, I've come up with ways to iterate on them and expand them to make my life easier or make my games more interesting. I've also stumbled upon new libraries because I found myself thinking "If only the script could do this..."
Thanks, StackOverflow user helped me out: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54335492/1337199
We stopped using it in lambda after cost testing, load testing. we redesigned the app to fan out to multiple lambdas. anyone else have experience with this?
You can [pip download](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_download/) into a local directory on your machine, then pip install from there.
Thank you buddy for valuable tips and the sample code. I am really going to do a version with selenium. It sounds more promising in terms of results and functionality.
Thank you, Sir! You guys are awesome. This is super helpful.
Any chance making it float rounding safe? That’d be rad. 
give visual studio code with the python extension a try, its a very nice IDE, Very easy to set up
Have you looked into the raspberry pi community (here or online generally)? There's a massive amount of really varied projects there which you can either do with a pi or adapt for whatever environment you've got Random example: [https://electronicsforu.com/raspberry-pi-projects](https://electronicsforu.com/raspberry-pi-projects)
Can you elaborate more? An example use case would be super useful! Most datasets don't round the box values so I don't make assumptions on type, though rounding should be easily doable.
Think of your hobbies and things you enjoy. Web scraping can be helpful for many hobbbies, so that’s a skill. Or try building games But here is something you my find fun if you like programming, try looking at another language like C or C++ It will give you a deeper understanding of programming in general which will greatly help your python skills. Python is great because you don’t have to deal with a lot of the underlying things, it is like the difference between driving a car and learning how to build one kinda thing 
I wish I knew aiohttp had on_startup and on_shutdown callbacks that are the easiest way to start/stop your async services. And you always wants to embed an API anyway so....
&gt; So which of your two apparently separate questions would you like an answer to then? The one everyone else already answered, thanks. 
Thanks, great to hear!
Thanks! Yes pathlib is highly useful and fairly intuitive compared to the os module!
read the sidebar.
Cheers dude.
That must be why there are so many very well renumerated python positions. 
I have never had a any issue setting up Sublime Text. Sublime is not an IDE, it is a code editor. Real Python have a very nice guide to setting up SBT for Python, a quick search should find it. Is your Python path set correctly? For Windows this would have been easily done when installing Python 3, by selecting Customize Installation -&gt; Add Python 3.7 to PATH. 
I think you need to URL encode the password first: def make_url(password): encoded_password = urllib.urlencode(password) url = f'postgresql://kara_admin:{encoded_password}@hifi-kara-db-dev.do.aws/kara?sslmode=required' return url
Is this Windows or Mac? If Windows, it's possible that you haven't set up a PATH. When you installed it did you agree to set it up as a path? Basically when you run a program from the command line, if the file isn't added to your list of paths, it can't find it unless you've navigated to the folder it's in first. Thing of your list of paths as an list of shortcuts. * Start Menu * Search "environment" and click "Edit the System Environmental Variables" * In the pop up window click "Environmental Variables..." * Under "User variables for _____" highlight "Path" and choose "Edit" * In the pop up window select "New" on the right * Copy in the location of your python folders (mine has four and looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/jwWVT84). * Ok out of it, restart Sublime and try again. This time it should be able to find python.exe and crack on.

Sorry, I deleted my comment before I realized you responded.
My original comment used the urlencode() function but that takes key/value pairs, not a string. That's what I get for not testing before I posted. ``` import urllib ... def make_url(password): encoded_password = urllib.parse.quote(password) url = f'postgresql://kara_admin:{encoded_password}@hifi-kara-db-dev.do.aws/kara?sslmode=required' return url ``` 
No problem `quote` and `unquote` [appear to work](https://github.com/reahl/reahl/issues/245).

Haha, I'm actually meeting with my advisor tomorrow to put together my prelim exam/thesis plan so I can graduate on time! I guess that could still go in the direction of "add more work" though... 
I haven't found any results on OVA, and on docker not one good tutorial on youtube... Do you know of any good ones? 
One thing you could check is if the data is loaded asynchronous, and could be fetched straight from a Json-file, rather than spinning up Selenium. Open up devtools in your browser, go to the `network`-tab. Refresh the page, inspect `XHR`-documents coming in from the server.
You can build wheels with `pip install wheel` and then `pip wheel &lt;packages&gt;`.
Selenium has built in wait_for methods that do what your while loop does.

the cloud providers like aws provide building blocks necessary for resilience, but its up to you to use them to deploy a highly available and redundant system
For my off-line home automation system I'm using two Android based tools that are fantastic (and don't require cloud): TTS -&gt; Ivona voice. The company was gobbled up by Google and they're not on play anymore but you can still find everything you need (apk and voices) on the wider interweb. STT -&gt; Google offline. There's a hack available that forces google's recognition to use its offline data, and it still works great - way better than Sphinx. So... for my python based home automation system I use an Android vm to do the recognition and speech. 
What if the problem was just to add two numbers? What would you do?
ah is it about his book ?
After running my hello\_world.py in Sublime Text it wants me to run 1 \~$ cd desktop/python\_work/ 2 \~/desktop/python\_work$ ls hello\_world.py 3 \~/desktop/python\_work$ python hello\_world.py In the terminal. That exactly how it's shown in the book. Every time I press return to start a new line it runs the first line of code. How do I get the terminal to start a new line of code without entering it? I looked for a sidebar and didn't find one or the option of showing one. 
Huh, it isn't there now.
I'm on the wrong side of the world to attend, but I've got friends who go to PyCon UK and it's amazingly friendly. Even if you arrive by yourself, you won't be there alone!
I've been wanting to use a directory/file walking tool like yours to find duplicate (or partially duplicated) directories. I.e. I'd like to scan my system and find all the duplicated files, rolled up to the directory level - so that I can deal with duplicates at the directory level 1st and at the file level 2nd. But since storage keeps getting cheaper, I keep delaying doing it. :)

I don't disagree necessarily with the other comments, but I feel the Selenium card is being pulled a bit too lightly in general. I find it's often a lot more efficient to sniff the XHR (the "ajax" bit) using the Network tab of the browser developer console, then replicate those using the requests module. Authentication is generally quite easy to bypass, typically by manually login once, save the session cookie and pass that as a parameter. In fact, modern React or Angular-based website are generally piece of cake to scrape, as they manipulate some kind of JSON API in the back, on which we can plug directly, and get nicely coded JSON data instead of crappy, hard to parse HTML. Moreover, I found that a lot of websites use client-side tricks to block Selenium, but rarely block access to the API. In a nutshell, to get started, using Chrome or Firefox (probably works with some other stuff), open the dev console (F12, or right-click -&gt; Inspect), in there open the XHR tab, reload the page. This will list all the stuff pulled from JS library calls, it's easy to look at the content and see which one has the bits we want to extract, what were the call parameters and so. It's then easy to replicate that query (Chrome, and I'm sure FF even has an option to "Copy as curl", to re-run that query from the command line) and strip what's unnecessary. Hitting the API directly generally yields a lot more information, and is a lot easier to manipulate (pagination? No need to find which button to click on, just ask for 99999999 results per page, or iterate through the "page" parameters or whatnot). Put it another way: with Selenium you mimick clicking on stuff and being a human, this is very easily defeated, slow and requires seriously heavy dependencies. Understanding the underlying API and how to hit it requires a little bit more upfront investment, but makes your life easier. Moreover, such APIs tend to be a bit more stable, whereas the DOM (i.e.: where to click) tend to change at a fast pace.

Hi, I've run the Groovy code without specifying the type for x, y etc. The execution time is 13 seconds. The original code that specifies the types gives 3 sec (i.e. similar to what was posted to stackoverflow). So, Groovy does feel the impact of loose typing. But, still, it;s facter than Python. Agree, pypy will be faster in this scenario (\~3 sec).

Async doesn’t buy you anything in most cases like this. You still need to load all the files and the speed of loading files is still limited by your hardware. The one case where it might help would be if you had tons of files that contained the names of other files and you wanted to load them as a graph but not just load the whole set into memory. But that’s a pretty weird usecase. 
OVA -- please see https://www.davidklee.net/2012/10/03/create-a-portable-virtual-machine-with-ovf-or-ova/ Docker's a bit more involved, but doable. There's also [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). Good luck!
I disagree, unless we are going to completely ban asking any questions in /r/Python. The OP may be an expert in all areas of Python other than PDFs, for all we know. 
You have never read the sidebar either, have you &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode. 
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [Just spent 2 hours to automate joining csv files saving hundreds of hours a year](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a085dx/just_spent_2_hours_to_automate_joining_csv_files/) \#2: [I wrote a book on Python Regular Expressions, it is FREE through this weekend](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/aevgbi/i_wrote_a_book_on_python_regular_expressions_it/) \#3: [Learning Python and managed to save my company thousands per year](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a0jqpr/learning_python_and_managed_to_save_my_company/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/afd0dd/blacklist/)
If that was the case, then OP could google it and shouldn't bother a place that says "Don't ask python questions here" in the sidebar.
theluketaylor is right, its up to you to put the tools provided by the cloud provider together properly. With that said if you are unfamiliar with AWS, I would highly recommend codestar which allows you to upload your code and AWS will build out the necessary infrastructure to a certain extent. As for replication, this is to basically be a live copy of the db on another host which allows failover or recovery and is updated on a very short interval. The 2 basic options for replication are master-master or master-slave. Take a look at the following as a good information source and tutorial on setting up a master-slave set of DB instances [https://www.toptal.com/mysql/mysql-master-slave-replication-tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/mysql/mysql-master-slave-replication-tutorial)
[itertools.product](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.product) should do what you're looking for. ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools &gt;&gt;&gt; nuc_3 = [''.join(v) for v in itertools.product('ATCG', repeat=8)] &gt;&gt;&gt; assert(len(nuc_3) == 4**8) &gt;&gt;&gt; nuc_3 ['AAAAAAAA', 'AAAAAAAT', 'AAAAAAAC', 'AAAAAAAG', 'AAAAAATA', 'AAAAAATT', 'AAAAAATC', 'AAAAAATG', 'AAAAAACA', 'AAAAAACT', 'AAAAAACC', 'AAAAAACG', 'AAAAAAGA', 'AAAAAAGT', 'AAAAAAGC', 'AAAAAAGG', 'AAAAATAA', ...] ```
It does not say that, but I think I understand your position, that there should be no questions asked in /r/Python, because it isn't "News". I read the OP question not as a how-to question, but more as "Can anyone recommend a PDF library for Python that includes feature x?", which I think is a moderately interesting question. Sidebar notwithstanding, I believe /r/Python should not be strictly limited to News. I think we should encourage interesting questions here. If you really ONLY want Python News, you might like /r/PythonNews
Thanks a lot. Any good resource you recommend? I don't want to end up messing this up.
Okay then it should be alright. Thank you
To what? Really, the Python source code is the best place to go to really figure out what's going on. Most of asyncio is written in Python, so it is actually straightforward.
Actually, reading the original question again, I think netgu is right, and I was giving OP too much benefit of the doubt. There is actually nothing in the question to show OP tried to find the answer before asking here.
Well, asyncio has a mechanism so that your coroutine can wait on an executor to complete. Clearly if that's the only async thing you need to do, they going asyncio is overkill. But the point is you can do regular non-blocking async stuff with asyncio and if you run into something that blocks, you can still seamlessly use an executor and still have async semantics.
It was a decorator. They added it to the language because it was so fundamental.
\`await\` doesn't technically release control. It just chains the object of the await. Ultimately, you have to await a coroutine that actually swaps, like a stream reader or writer.
You have to use the blit command. Treat it like a sprite.
Thanks. This was helpful. I'll ask the same question that I asked earlier. How should I store data for different tenants ? 1. Same table having different tenants data 2. Same database but different schemas 3. Different databases altogether Because if I use the 3rd way, which many have recommended here and then I'm to use a master-slave configuration for setting up the replication scheme, then I'll have so many db instances running around. For example - for 3 restaurants. Let's assume I'm using 2 slaves for 1 master. In that case, I'll have 3*3 = 9 instances of db. And this will just increase with more tenants. Is this a viable option ? Also wouldn't it cost higher to have so many db instances in production ?

Hmm. I had tried the blit command and couldn’t get it to work. That’s what was making the image not show up...maybe it has something to do with the alpha layer but I swear I’ve done that right. I’ll have to give it a shot in the morning when I have caffeine on my side.
Sounds good- a bigger chunk of code may help find the issue. You may be overwriting it with the background or something. 
More often than not, I use Python to preprocess data and as 'glue' between various software tools and simulations.
That definitely could be. I feel like it is probably some dumb mistake that I’m just overlooking lol. Thanks for the assist.
Next impersonation will lead to an immediate ban.
For some reason it bothers me that for myCroft you have to create a “home” account on their server. Which if they are trying to push privacy , is not that private. I have not tested it, but the instructions are clear that that’s how you install features. But makes you wonder what else is being exchanged. 
Is there any way a system can deadlock? I.e. host a has an async waiting on a blocking call to host B, which cannot service it until it resolves a blocking call to host A? I suppose I could dig into the docs and figure it out, but the post was asking for the questions that come to mind about the library.
This is way better than what the C guy here would have come up with: Counting from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF and using the bit pairs (all 8 of them) for ATCG ;)
I'm sure you have something you can use programming for. Your probably in school. Have math class? Write a program that can help you do your homework problems. Ever need to email your teachers or upload your homework online? Write a script that does that. Make a program that you can use to help you study for a test. Think about your hobbies. Surely you like browsing the web / Reddit. You could try to write a program that helps you by finding posts for you. Or adding on to that try to learn web stuff and make a website (may want to learn CSS and HTML if that really appeals to you but there are python solutions) Idk what you like. video games? you can try to write something that will help you game. Could be as simple as a counter that helps keeps your stats from matches of a game. Or it could be complex like a machine learning self driving car in GTA (YouTuber Sentdex did this. Look up the series it really opened my eyes to what's possible in python ) If you like music, make a program that finds cool new bands. You like buying things? Make a program that can tell you when an item goes on sale. There's all sorts of possibilities IMO if you want to be a programmer you have to be creative. First you identify a problem that you have, realize that something could be done quicker or easier. Could be anything extremely minor or extremely major. Next, you look for a way to solve that problem. If you don't know how, try to figure it out. (Sometimes there's no shame in Googling it) not experienced enough or too difficult? At least try, you'd be surprised. Take it one small step at a time. If you want to do something complex, try to scale it down or do a similar project that would help you learn the skills you need. If your still stumped, theirs plenty of code challenge websites or books you can follow and so their exercises. Some people swear by them but i don't really use anything like that. And if you really feel you don't know anything yet... Make a freaking game. Text based games are really fun to make IMO. I have started a ton so far cause I love rogulike games and text adventures dwarf fortress etc. A game is kinda relaxing IMO because it doesn't HAVE to be anything. If I'm writing a script to send out emails it has to do a few specific things and do it all completely right. But a game can be whatever you want it to be. If you want you can even try pygame and make a 2d graphical game but you won't get *great* performance from python if it's too complex. 
Basically brute force, correct?
Would itertools.permute also work for this particular case? It looks like the OP is trying to generate all permutations of the list ATCG
I guess so. It would give you the same result. Each of the for loops in the question is like counting a "digit" in an 8 digit number where each digit can be represented by 4 values (which fits in 2 bits). So counting from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF basically iterates all combinations of 16 bits or 8 x 2 bit digits. That's how I picture it anyway... but my explanation probably didn't clear it up and it certainly isn't python-esque.

The result determines the fastest recommended spindle speed we should use. I used pysimplegui to make a quick and easy calculator that does all the repetitive arithmetic for me. Saves a ton of time and paper.

Excellent idea. Would you recommend Postgres for dB ? 
[`itertools.combinations_with_replacement`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations_with_replacement) would be the cleanest imo. It's not a permutation because permutations don't have repeats, only changes in ordering.
Hey, do you have any idea on how to run curses on widows? &amp;#x200B;
I'm pretty sure that because all the curses calls are through the python bindings it should just work if you have Python 3. I meant to check this but I haven't had time yet.
It's not a permutation because permutation don't have repeats, only counting distinct ordering. product looks like the correct method here. You can do a one-liner in python3 if you use the repeat parameter: `itertools.product(['A', 'T', 'C', 'G'], repeat=8)`

DNA factoring? 
Actuary here. I use it for data analysis, data cleaning, web scraping, and formatting data for use in older admin systems. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools &gt;&gt;&gt; nuc_3 = [''.join(v) for v in itertools.product('ATCG', repeat=8)] &gt;&gt;&gt; assert(len(nuc_3) == 4**8) &gt;&gt;&gt; nuc_3 ['AAAAAAAA', 'AAAAAAAT', 'AAAAAAAC', 'AAAAAAAG', 'AAAAAATA', 'AAAAAATT', 'AAAAAATC', 'AAAAAATG', 'AAAAAACA', 'AAAAAACT', 'AAAAAACC', 'AAAAAACG', 'AAAAAAGA', 'AAAAAAGT', 'AAAAAAGC', 'AAAAAAGG', 'AAAAATAA', ...] 
The correct answer has already been posted, but I wanted to point out that strings are already iterable. You can just write ```for i in "ACTG":```.
Every iterative function can be converted to a recursive function and vise versa.

Thanks I'll try it
Okay I'll look into it
It's a bit slower than itertools, but recursion would be another way to do this that's a bit cleaner than nested loops: import time import itertools def atcg(str): if len(str) == 8: return [str] return atcg(str + 'A') + atcg(str + 'T') + atcg(str + 'C') + atcg(str + 'G') t0 = time.time() res1 = atcg('') print('Recursion:', time.time() - t0) t0 = time.time() res2 = [''.join(v) for v in itertools.product('ATCG', repeat=8)] print('Itertools:', time.time() - t0) print(res1 == res2) 
&gt; I'm sure FF even has an option to "Copy as curl" Can confirm it does.
Also worth noting that this is just a base 4 number system and you want to count from zero to 65535
Hey, I tried to install python again with the create environment variables ticked then I get another error saying http://imgur.com/9jL70g3

Lose the square brackets in `payment = [...]`.
Right. Pico2wav is terrible... 
1: /r/learnpython 2: read the sidebar 3: print(payment)
u/adjective_cat_noun might have a different solution, though the itertools method might be one they wish they'd known about 4 years ago.
Ah I see. I ended up adding the brackets to 0 following your logic of being consistent with the usage of the brackets. Thank you for your help and for making my first posting experience on Reddit a positive one! :D
The original solution is also brute force, he just rolled all the 8 loops that are counting to 4 into a single loop that goes over 65536 times (4 ^ 8). It is doing the same job, bit it is more elegant and faster, the values of individual counters are every 2 bits of the 4 bytes of an unsigned int. The least significant bits are the inner loop, most significant are the outer.
And a third example, somewhere in between: def atcg(s): if len(s) == 8: yield s else: yield from atcg(s + 'A') yield from atcg(s + 'T') yield from atcg(s + 'C') yield from atcg(s + 'G') This version avoids concatenating a huge list together out of single elements, but still concatenates a ton medium-sized strings together.
Thanks! 
 nuc_3 = [] for nucleotides in itertools.product('ATCG', repeat=8): nuc_3.append(''.join(nucleotides) or even shorter nuc_3 = map(''.join, itertools.product('ATCG', repeat=8))
FWIW, [that is nearly what the product implementation does](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/itertoolsmodule.c#L2081). A small wrinkle in that it represents the number as an array of 8 indices, all less than 4, and then does the addition and carry manually.
Rust recently implemented a macro for replacing the need to print variable names and locations within the file manually called dbg. This is a really nice feature and well implemented so I replicated it in python and Golang. You can import dbg from pydbg at the top of your file or use a 1-liner `from pydbg import dbg; dbg(&lt;exp&gt;)`. 
# marked as duplicate question
Nice, though you code could be a lot cleaner if you reserved `i.code_context[0]` to something like **ctx**. Also I might be reading it wrong, but isn't everything you do to find the end index for the slice the same as `ctx.rfind(")")`?
why should someone use this instead of pdb (or an IDE's debugger)?
Here is a compact recursive solution without the need for extra tools: def gen(l, s=""): if l &lt;= 0: return [s] return [k for c in "ATCG" for k in gen(l-1, s+c)] simply call `gen(l)` with `l` as the length of each individual string.
I don't get it, what's the difference?

Ah, people not using the redesign...
Recursion is bad in python. For example this function: def f(x): x -= 1 if x &gt; 0: return f(x) else: return x With default configuration, this works: f(100) But this doesnt: f(10000) "RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison"
I don't see how these are related to this. This is an easier an alternative to print and format strings, just like in rust.
... the formatting?
Print ("Good bot")
you dont understand how debuggers are related to a debugger?
But if I am processing a file while the other is veing loaded it buys me time no??
But this isn't a debugger, it's a print macro
Is the code in a private GH repo..or are there docs anywhere? I would be interested in seeing more about this instead of this small set of examples on the PyPI page. Also your examples have some typos and won't actually run. I think this is a valuable project and I would super use it but I'm not sold on the API. Why a nested namespace for just a few classes and functions? Why `jaccard_index_2d` instead of `iou`? Why specify 2d/3d in the class name instead of an attribute or just via the number of args in the constructor? `BBox2D` is super annoying to type out (and I know how petty that is, but I literally typed it wrong 3 times in a row). I mean at least the default can be 2D with `BBox` and 3D requires the specification; or neither, which I'd prefer. It's not likely you're going to cross them in a single project, so just spit out different objects via a factory depending on the number of arguments supplied or something. 
&gt; debugging macro &gt; print debuggers &gt; pydbg &gt; dbg &gt; debug &gt; debugging &gt; debugging-tool for something that isn't a debugger, that word sure pops up a lot in the documentation 
https://cl.ly/5c21fae10c57
Thanks for the input guys. I believe it helped me improve the code. Here is where it is now: 
It's because it's a port of the `dbg!(x)`, which is shorter than `println!("x: {}", x)`, which would be primarily used for debugging.
Updated code: 
Damn... That's super sexy. I've done a bit of C and it file content manipulation for the most part so it really talks to me. I think I'm gonna upgrade a few scripts 
depends i guess which direction your going for... front end.. back end.. 
No thanks :) I would like some more details on how to handle import from glade and setting that up though. A simple hello world example would work. 
What kind of job are you going for? Doing business oriented things myself, I'm needed more for being organized, not letting things break. And so much repetition. I don't often touch fancy features. But a job doing cutting edge things will be looking for completely different things.
Uhm. It's a one liner. import itertools set(itertools.permutations(["A", "T", "G", "C"])) 
tl;dr use `memoryview` for zero-copy if you already have a big chunk of memory storing the object. ----- I think it's still lacking a little. We need to scatter/gather API calls for actual IOs to move stuff around. Also splice() syscalls.
Make sure to not only focus on the technical side of things. Soft skills are often very important in an interview. It can't hurt to practice interviews a lot, and maybe you'll get hired in the process. 
That's strange. Maybe you can just edit the system variables one instead. I think the only difference is that the system variables is for all users but just you. The other option is to manually add PATH to toy
I tend to do cleanup like in JS: I just don't do it. It's true that I've not seen every JS code ever written but I've also never seen people clearing `setTimeout` or `setInterval` in `onbeforeunload` or `unload`.
Ok that's great this means the path bit is sorted because you are actually running python now. I don't know about sublime but it looks like you're running python.exe without telling it what script to run. Assuming your script is saved as "helloworld.py" then the terminal should show "python.exe helloworld.py" I don't know how to fix this in sublime but there should be a settings section where you tell it what to do when you select to run code. Making progress though! 
There's a lot situations where printf debugging is still easier, like stuff buried deep in web frameworks where you don't want to block the whole process.
First actual bad thing I've ever seen about python. Thanks v much for posting this. Maybe the logic is just that it's better to have a defined limit rather than just leaving it up to memory capacity? 
You're asking too general of a question. You might as well ask what you need to know to get a job as a reader.
Just building some nice double helices. 
Just did it, seems like the problem was in me trying to edit a non .py Untitled document. Still thanks for the help, and can't wait to star my journey in coding. ^_^
Recursion is a thing to avoid in most real languages. It's good in academics but I've othereise never come across a situation where I prefer the recursive solution to the iterative one.
can you name a specific situation where that is true? I can't think of a single one where i would want the logic to be executed after what im debugging, nor can i think of a situation where setting a break point takes longer than wrapping/unwrapping something with a print statement
Neither solution is brute force since they both enumerate valid solutions only
Now I know I'm a "print debugger" :-) &amp;#x200B; Thanks, seems useful. 
You could also use map to have an iterator and avoiding creating 65536 strings in one time. (Useful for bigger size)
Tree and graph traversal come to mind
For sure, but constantly worrying about the stack isn't fun. Maybe I've been in legacy code for too long.
Yeah, I don't use recursion often, but I for sure do have _some_ recursive code in production.
For the future, if you are refactoring `if` statements, you can use something called guard clauses. Very clean. [https://refactoring.guru/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses](https://refactoring.guru/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses)
This is the job for a backtracking algorithm, but honestly I don't remember how to do this anymore.
Ah yes that'll be it. You should check out the python discord channel by the way. You can get real time help there. 
Yeah, it took me a second to think of how you would do trees if you *couldn't* recurse
There were some discussions in python-ideas about a debug mode for f-strings similar to dbg! . a = 1 print(f'{a + 1!d}') Output: a + 1 = 2 * https://discuss.python.org/t/f-string-debug-conversion/99/12 * https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-October/053956.html

It works in old reddit and on the mobile site, the original does not.
Have you heard of this magical thing called stackoverflow
Try thinking of it's usage as an action word for a sepcific style of debugging. This is for example how i quickly debug. I dont have the time or motivation currently to learn PDB or Unit Testing properly

Well, thanks for the help, unfortunately Mac OS doesn't have command *apt-get,* so i used Homebrew.

I've interviewed many many developers and I have never judged them on what libraries or regular expressions they know. In fact, I don't even care if they know Python, specifically. What I care about is: can they program? Can they reason about a technical problem, break it down into logical steps, and write some code (and tests) to solve that problem?
List comprehensions?
yes and no one gave the right answer
Thank you for the feedback, I'll most definitely check them out.
I am currently working on the docs and hope to have them ready soon. Thank you for pointing out the typos. Jaccard Index is the mathematical term for IoU and it felt having that as the naming convention made more sense. Adding the iou syntactic sugar is easy to do though. The reason I separated the naming of 2D and 3D is because 3D boxes have very different properties from 2D and using a flag to denote which would make the code very unwieldy and hard to maintain. As for number of arguments, while 2D boxes only need 4 arguments, 3D boxes need upto 9 (x, y, z, h, l, w, 3 rotation angles), so using number of arguments would not be a very good way to decipher the two. This is over and above the issue of different behaviors of the two types of boxes. I was actually hoping that users would find value in crossing the two classes together (do 2D and 3D detection simultaneously). x, y is the top left corner for 2D boxes and for 3D, there is a flag that lets you specify the whether (x, y, z) is the back left corner of the cuboid or the center. I could do this for 2D as well. I think the right thing to do next is to open source it. :)
I've raised a problem report with Reddit about this, requesting a fix. The product admin agreed to get an understanding of how much work that would be. That was 3 months ago. https://redd.it/9ozbjd 
Does it work by explicitly running it as python3? I.e run it as "python3 chaos.py" perhaps there is multiple versions of python on your machine and it is default using a depreciated version (2.7)
Crabboen is well aware of this, this is why he also gave an example of when the the speaker naively misinterprets the meaning of the word: the browser analogy. Yes, if you write JavaScript and it runs in a browser, you are, indeed programming the browser, but to say that you are programming a browser, when what you do is writing JavaScript is useless, because it confuses people who actually program browsers. However, willim, has indeed no clue as to what filesystem are, and is equally confused, just as the author of the original post. He or she seem to think that there is any dependency between a perceived level of language (which is ultimate bullshit anyways), and what "filesystem" means, and, on top of that, they seem to think that there is such a thing as physical filesystems (is this as opposed to virtual filesystems? Imaginary filesystem? Immaterial filesystem? But, really, what the hell are you even talking about?)
I only have one version of python on my computer. I just downloaded it last night. I will try that though. 
I don't understand in which situations this would be superior to logging, could you please elaborate on the use cases for someone that doesn't know about dbg ?
Select doesn't do asynchronous I/O and has nothing to do with `asyncio`. So, talking about it in the context of `asyncio` is pointless.
Isn’t the eval proof it’s using python 2.7? Also /r/learnpython
Same issue 
After the `print (x)` line hit return then hit return again until the prompt changes from `...` to `&gt;&gt;&gt;`. Then enter `main()`.
Is it a windows machine? Some linux distros have 2.7 default on them. 
It does threaded I/O, so, it's neither asynchronous, nor non-blocking... It would be really just easier to use threads w/o having to deal with `asyncio`. There was another link in this thread, which gets closer to asynchronous I/O (it has C code that interfaces with Python and uses `posix_aio` group of system calls from Linux kernel). It still doesn't achieve the asynchronous I/O because those system calls don't really achieve that... but, like I said, it's closer to the real thing.
Yes it is a Windows machine 
This is extremely important for junior devs, but I also critical in most seniors devs as well: Show you are interested in technology and willing to learn. To me, being a dev is not 9-5, those are just the hours you are paid for. Guys who love programming are working on something at home, or reading about the latest stuff in a different field entirely. Their brains are usually active on something, even hacking up a fun little project with their kids. Almost no one is hired into a greenfield project, so no matter what you're going to have to learn new libraries, code styles and process flows at wherever you get hired. So have your random projects up on your github/gitlab or whatever up there with all your terrible ideas that never panned out. Have that one cool project that is terrible but works open to the world. But have black, isort, pre-commit, pipenv/poerty or whatever is the latest package manager going today. Show you are following the python environment and that will take you further than a regular expression ever will. Listen to podcasts like PythonBytes, Security Now or whatever floats your boat in technology. Read a couple articles a day and you would be surprised by what google assistant starts bringing to your front door. Being able to drop tidbits of you heard this idea from source X but haven't been able to use it or you are still struggling to understand its full implications will be a good differentiator of you and the rest of the field during interviews. 
That fixed it. Thanks. 
Did you press tab when indenting the blocks? Python is scoped via indentation. I'm just spitballing at this point 
Again, it's like saying that I can do asynchronous I/O if I write my own kernel, in a language other than Python, on a hardware I invent and manufacture, and then... drum roll... connect it to Python and `asyncio`, and then saying that that's somehow the feature of `asyncio`.
Well, `itertools` is part of the standard library, so trying to avoid it is quite pointless :)
Cant believe I didnt notice that lol. Nice eye
No, yield points in Go are not explicit. Go decides who yields to whom when your code is compiled. I.e. your compiler inserts the code that does yielding. You don't write it.
Due to the fact that you can do so fucking much with python you should specialize the type of job you want to do. You can do web development, data science, machine learning, security artist, system admin etc. pp. The specific python requirements for all of these jobs are different. 
I am no "print-debugger". I use the debugger of Pycharm. :D But little useful lib, gj. 
Thank you for your reply. If I may suggest, I would prefer it if the 'Custom plan' column was removed and instead put the contents of the modal view just under the rest of the plans advertised as "Create your own plan". Whichever design you eventually choose should not have these sliders hidden Keep up the good stuff, really like what you've done 
Always look at the problem "from far away" and break it down into functional modules. Then look closer at each module and think what Data it operates on and what functions you need to process the Data. Think about classes you might need. Then start coding one of the small parts and test it. Keep going like that and eventually start to tie stuff together.

If this was posted on r/computerscience it would be removed within 5 mins because it's too *basic* of a question. It's nice that this community here is friendlier to beginners!
It's the same dataframe. You cannot actually make Python copy objects when it calls functions with those objects as arguments. Not implicitly that is. However, to answer your question precisely: No, it's not a pointer. It is not a copy either. What Python's interpreter sees are pointers to `PyObject`, which don't by themselves, describe everything about the object. There's a lot of indirection involved. So, some fields may not be exclusive to the object being passed. Some can be shared with other objects. And, sometimes, it's really hard to establish who is actually storing the field you are interested in. Whenever a Python procedure is called with a pointer to `PyObject`, some copying does occur, but it is because it needs to update reference count in PyObject struct. So, the caller and the callee never actually see the same object, but these details are not accessible to Python runtime.
You don't tell python who you're yielding to either, you just say `await` and let the event loop mechanics do their thing. To add a function onto the event loop in go, similarly you even still use a keyword - `go`.
Electronics engineer. We have multiple test benches which all produce their own raw ascii data files. Python classes are used to read these custom files and perform standalone data analysis or are used as plug ins into commercial data analysis software. 
Trying to find a race condition? That's a classical case, where debugging will probably not help. This is because debugger will block on a particular thread it is connected to, but other threads will keep running (doesn't really work like that in Python, but they still can be sleeping while you are connected to a different thread). So, say, you have a race, when configuration file is sometimes read after your first logging is written, and your configuration is responsible for the logging format, so, every now and then, you miss a few lines of your logs. If you try to put a breakpoint in the procedure called in a thread that writes anything to logs, then your configuration will be definitely loaded before any logging can happen, and you will never experience the bug the same way it happens in your program.

so the library method is factually worse and not "way better"?
Most likely or not, be able to make applications that interact with databases.
Why? Eval is still there in Python 3
Like many others pointed out, this question is too general to give you the answer you're probably looking for. I'll however try to give you some insight. (I'm assuming you have some experience as a software engineer or that you actually have some programming skills) First of all, you need to know the syntax of Python well. You should know how to use all the useful constructs Python (as a language) provides, when to use them and most importantly: when NOT to make use of them. Secondly, builtins and the standard library. Builtins should be easy to learn (there's a limited number of them). Make sure that you know how and when to use a dict, set, list or tuple. That's a good entry point for solving real problems. Standard library is a much more broader topic to study and you should pick the packages that you find useful. The most general ones will probably be itertools, functools, concurrent.futures, abc, subprocess and collections. This list is NOT exhaustive and the order is random. Next thing is the ability to create pythonic (idiomatic) code. This ability is what tells apart a professional Python programmer from a programmer who simply knows Python. You can start learning by reading PEP8, but this is yet another broad topic. And the last thing: third party libraries. What you should learn depends on the projects you want to be working on, but some people would probably mention Django or Flask (for web development) or scikit-learn, NumPy and Pandas (for data science stuff). As a programmer, you should also concentrate on improving your problem solving skills.
If you really want to use `pip` for this (I'd advise against), then you need to read about `--find-links` arguments to `pip install`. The process will be painfully slow (with 20-40 libraries, it might take up to half an hour). Do not use `wheel`. Packages you listed may not be installable as wheels, unless you package them yourself (why do you need this pain?) Simple way, with no install: just put your virtual environment on your USB stick. Somewhat more difficult: use system utilities to copy the packages you need into `site-packages` directory (writing such a script takes a hour with a lot of coffee breaks).
What's the point? If the user doesn't want to install Python, what are the chances they will install a VM player or Docker? Especially because Docker and most VM players are defective on Windows or Mac.
I use actual commented lines of text to layout my scripts... #Go get the data from the file ... #Read each line and then do X,Y,Z ... #Create a new class and process output ... #Save class array to file in CSV format Then I write the functions or code to do what I have written.
You are lucky if what Pyinstaller produces runs at all. But if you need to package all of your stuff together, I don't think there's a reliable way to make a single binary out of a Python program. Maybe in some very simple cases... So, if you need to install the program in the way the users of the system are familiar with how programs are installed: create a distribution package, like DEB for Debian-derived Linux, RPM for RHEL-derived ones, MSI for MS Windows and whatever they use in Apple land.
Regex? Fuck no
You can have my print() when you try it from my cold-dead-hands
Honestly with c# I could've easily make a single exe for this script and it'd be the size of a couple megabytes and with instant runtime, why isn't this possible with python? 
 &gt;Jaccard Index is the mathematical term for IoU and it felt having that as the naming convention made more sense. Adding the iou syntactic sugar is easy to do though.

Check out yourself 😉 https://bingoproject.pythonanywhere.com/app/
with jetbrains IDEs you can set how breakpoints treat threads. i.e, break on current thread or break on all. then you can switch between stack frames painlessly i can't remember debugging a multithreaded python app, but I'm certain pycharm works the same as in idea and clion
I say this often: It's hard to make something. It's easy to make something better. This is the same as writer's block and also known as the "blank page" problem. Or if you've ever learned a foreign language, you may have noticed it easier to understand someone than it is to speak. I find the key is to just jump in. Don't worry about if it's the right place or if this is how you'll want this to work later. Don't think about the future. Just take the most immediately obvious problem and solve it any old way. You have a list of URLs in a file that you want to scrape? Open that file and read the URLs. That's it. After you've done that, you'll be like...well, I guess I need to hand these URLs to urllib to fetch? Do that. Etc. You may find that some previous step was wrong. If so, just go fix that right now. (Using git or other source control to checkpoint your code and manage alternate ideas in branches is extremely valuable.) I've found it enormously helpful to allow myself to just throw code away when I don't like it. You'll think about the hours/days/weeks you put into writing it and not want to re-do all that work. But really, it takes literally orders of magnitude less time to recreate. I spent 6 months making a fairly large project once and then realized the fundamental design was wrong. I had the entire thing rewritten in 3 days and it worked much, much better. I would definitely have wasted more than 3 days trying to work around the problems with the original code by now.
Holy crap that's disgusting 
Yeah, it has all the hallmarks of being the code included with the paper instead of a thing for practical use. I hope somebody untangles the mess into an usable package in the near future if it works well.
Yes, there is a surprising lack of such tools, but I also think it is because disk space is so cheap nowadays. But it is such a straightforward data set that can offer quite some insights into past interests and what projects I used to worked on.
Interesting, thanks for sharing!
No, /u/smellslikedonkey way is the optimal way of doing it. It's just hard to read.
r/dailyprogrammer The only way to fix this is through practise. Start with easy challenges and work you way up. Compare your solutions to other people's afterwards. Don't be afraid to spend a few hours exploring different approaches. Solving a problem on your own isn't easy but it is definitely rewarding. 
No, /u/smellslikedonkey way is the optimal way, with no fat to trim. It's just harder to read.
The best programmers I worked with never touched a computer when at home. They programmer 40 hours a week, used company time to learn new things or go to conferences and spent their time outside work on other hobbies and interests. This led to them being well-rounded individuals who could also talk to customers if needed, and who quickly moved through the ranks.
How is doing it the same way you would have in C, but exposing a simple and useful iterator to Python, "factually worse"?
This is the most “Computer Science”: change the problem. Now it’s range(0, 4^length -1) Do a list comprehension where those values are stringified with leading zeroes(in binary), then iterate over the strings and map 00 to a, 01 to c, 10 to t, and 11 to g. It will do it in a single pass. `[numbers_to_genes(value, length) for value in range(0, 4**length -1)]`
Although that is a pretty good rule of thumb. If I'm looking for a Python Developer specifically, I expect them to have familiarity with the standard library and some key third party libraries dependant on the role.
