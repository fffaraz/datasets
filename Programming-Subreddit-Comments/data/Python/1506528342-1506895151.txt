I bet this could be shortened to like 50 lines or less. There's a lot of repetition that you can shorten using loops.
The standard elm tutorial is pretty good. Any way you slice it there will be a learning curve though. 
Possibly because it taught you do do memory management? Intertia? Python was still not a popular language and was probably not mainstream enough.
unfortunately, not out of the box, in the future it would be nice to use appium-desktop to give support for desktop app testing

[Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi) is in Greece, not in Russia. edit: This is sarcasm, btw. Just for those who didn't realize. As always.
**Delphi** Delphi ( or ; Greek: Δελφοί, [ðelˈfi]) is famous as the ancient sanctuary that grew rich as the seat of Pythia, the oracle consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world. Moreover, the Greeks considered Delphi the navel (or centre) of the world, as represented by the stone monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi. It occupies an impressive site on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus, overlooking the coastal plain to the south and the valley of Phocis. It is now an extensive archaeological site with a modern town of the same name nearby. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

CSV files don't have types, they are simple text files. What is your intent?
Yea, I think you'd need to define test cases for each field in the csv file, and run the file through those test cases.
What's the library situation like with Haskell? Is `cabal`/`cabal-install` pretty reliable? I've never learned nor used Haskell.

Too bad BuzzFeed is the worst god awful piece of shit site on the internet.
I just took a look at these submissions - https://www.reddit.com/r/buzzfeedbot/comments/72t4e3/22_things_to_help_you_deal_with_annoying_coworkers/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/buzzfeedbot/comments/72p5au/19_awesome_products_from_amazon_to_put_on_your/ It doesn't look like you are stripping out affiliate links. So for some of these posts, your bot is just compiling a list of Buzzfeed affiliate links for them to make money off of.
Yeah it works. I personally like `stack`.

It depends on your needs. If it's a one-off, then it's often easiest to simply hard-code the field constraints (types, case, length, min/max values, unknown values, etc) - and iterate through the file record by record checking whatever you'd like. However, if you have a variety of files, or if the constraints are liable to change fairly often then using something like Validictory with a separate validation config file may be a better way to go. The python package Validictory uses the json schema format, which is cool, but unlike json a csv will return all fields in a string format. So, you need to tweak the approach a bit to handle type and minimum &amp; maximum field length. Here's [a generic csv validation tool](https://github.com/kenfar/DataGristle/blob/master/scripts/gristle_validator) I wrote to use json schema against csv files.

Create a loop to read each file into a dataframe. Every iteration, add that dataframe to a list. After done, run pandas.concat(list_name) and output will be a combination. For rows with missing columns, you might get np.nans, so handle accordingly. 
It doesn't overload you until you want to be overloaded. What's overloading is a new programmer being told to use sublime with 20 extra plugins - and while you may not advocate those plugins, they invariable start trying to do it. Pycharm is about as out of the way as an IDE can be initially. Having pep8 reminders is GREAT code hygiene training. I personally do not think these small sets of built in reminders substantially increase the mental load of learning to write code. I do think that making a syntax error, seeing it go red and getting a popup about why it's wrong is awesome help for them as well. I think it cuts down on frustration from writing your code, alt-tabbing to your shell, running it, it not running, trying to decipher the error, alt-tabbing back and then having to try a fix and repeat. In all the students and interns I've worked with, a quality IDE made them instantly more productive and confident. I'm not advocating they start setting up the CI and downloading 20 plugins in PyCharm - I would be against that as well. I am advocating that pep8 and syntax help as well as code completion are massive productivity gains for new users and that builds confidence and familiarity with a language. I think you're wanting to claim they need to see failures more directly to understand what's happening but I am counter-arguing that THIS is the mental overhead you want to avoid when trying to remember syntax and just USE something initially.

Curses does actually block the program for a short amount of time after the escape key is pressed, to see if another character is sent afterwards. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27372068/why-does-the-escape-key-have-a-delay-in-python-curses It doesn't need to be a long delay. In practice, I've used the 25 ms recommended in that SO article and it has worked just fine for me. So I guess you would want to sys.stdin.read(1) and then if you get an escape sequence, do another read with a short timeout. 
Yes. I replied to a comment already with the github link to the source code. I'm on mobile right now so I don't feel like finding and copying the link again lol

&gt; It doesn't overload you until you want to be overloaded. As a programmer, you and I would probably think that. There's a lot more going on after opening the Window than you think. You're able to filter out most of it. Most people would need documentation to figure out how to start writing code and running it. That's just too much overhead. &gt; What's overloading is a new programmer being told to use sublime with 20 extra plugins - and while you may not advocate those plugins, they invariable start trying to do it. I don't recommend starting with Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code, or any other tool like that. A REPL and Notepad (in windows) is more than enough to get started. IDLE is okay, too. &gt; Pycharm is about as out of the way as an IDE can be initially. Which is still too in-the-way for a non-programmer. &gt; Having pep8 reminders is GREAT code hygiene training. Who cares about code hygiene when you're still not able to *code*? &gt; I personally do not think these small sets of built in reminders substantially increase the mental load of learning to write code. I do think that making a syntax error, seeing it go red and getting a popup about why it's wrong is awesome help for them as well. I think it cuts down on frustration from writing your code, alt-tabbing to your shell, running it, it not running, trying to decipher the error, alt-tabbing back and then having to try a fix and repeat. I think it does them a great disservice. Without learning how to engage in the edit-&gt;run-&gt;fix cycle, they'll encounter problems that the IDE can't help them with, and they've never developed the tools necessary to go about solving the problems. It's important to become frustrated, and learn how to triumph over your mistakes. An IDE "solves" the entry level problems for you, so you have to get started with the advanced problems. &gt; In all the students and interns I've worked with, a quality IDE made them instantly more productive and confident. Who's talking about productivity and confidence? OP literally told us that they've never coded before. We're not talking about getting juniors up to speed. They have already done the learning you seem so insistent on denying OP. &gt; I'm not advocating they start setting up the CI and downloading 20 plugins in PyCharm - I would be against that as well. I am advocating that pep8 and syntax help as well as code completion are massive productivity gains for new users and that builds confidence and familiarity with a language. When you're *learning to code*, productivity doesn't matter. &gt; I think you're wanting to claim they need to see failures more directly to understand what's happening but I am counter-arguing that THIS is the mental overhead you want to avoid when trying to remember syntax and just USE something initially. How can they hope to just USE something if they don't even know how to program? By your logic they should just copy and paste code into a file and run it instead of learning to write code. StackOverflow coding at its finest. Notepad works just as well for this as PyCharm, if not a bit better.
It's just a coincidence in that case that "Amy" came first. There's nothing wrong or unexpected about that screenshot. Even with the latest changes that make a dict print in the original order, it still wouldn't 'sort' something that is inherently unsortable, since those keys can be any arbitrary hashable value and not necessarily something logically sortable.
The Internet had been around for quite some time then. Back then WWW wasn't the dominate modality on the Internet, now they are basically synonyms. Back then other methods like FTP, Gopher, and in particular the Usenet were more popular. The Usenet would have been the Reddit of that era, and it still exists. People back then could find programming tools on anon FTP sites, or bulletin boards. And likely heard about Python on the Usenet.

&gt;what i am trying to do is scrape thing off the current page i am on in chrome. selenium doesnt seem to be able to handle manual clicks. It should do. In what instance does it fail? &gt;so is there a selenium-like automation, that basically detects what page im on, and if its a certain page, it analyzes the source-code as seen by a browser, but still lets me manually use the browser? You can use selenium to get the HTML content and then parse it with lxml.

The best thing to do if you're doing a lot of data processing is to learn [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), but a naive approach like this in pure-python would work as well. This is only one example of how you might go about validating a csv in Python. I like using custom types that inherit from non-mutable data structures like the `EmailAddress` type below that make it so that you know that any instance of that class is valid. i.e. if it exists, it's valid. Anyway, hope this serves you well as a way to think about how you might approach the problem import typing as T import logging from csv import DictReader from io import StringIO class EmailAddress(str): def __new__(cls, email: str): if '@' not in email: raise ValueError('invalid email') return super().__new__(cls, email) class IpV4Address(str): def __new__(cls, address: str): if not len(address.split('.')) == 4: raise ValueError('ip address must have 4 octets: ' + address) elif not all(0 &lt;= int(octet) &lt;= 255 for octet in address.split('.')): raise ValueError('octet in ip address out-of-range: ' + address) return super().__new__(cls, address) class Person(T.NamedTuple): id: int first_name: str last_name: str email: EmailAddress gender: str ip_address: IpV4Address @classmethod def from_row(cls, row: dict): return cls(**{ key: type_(row[key]) for key, type_ in cls._field_types.items() }) def validate_csv(reader: DictReader) -&gt; bool: for row in reader: try: Person.from_row(row) except Exception as e: logging.error('type: {} msg: {}'.format(type(e), e)) return False return True MOCK_DATA = ''' id,first_name,last_name,email,gender,ip_address 1,Tobiah,Giacovazzo,tgiacovazzo0@zdnet.com,Male,19.149.44.115 2,Shir,Januszewicz,sjanuszewicz1@acquirethisname.com,Female,153.89.169.230 3,Gaspar,Guitt,gguitt2@usa.gov,Male,174.171.101.164 4,Dun,Feakins,dfeakins3@indiatimes.com,Male,110.176.209.154 5,Tymon,Filewood,tfilewood4@pbs.org,Male,40.90.194.55 6,Ludvig,Urpeth,lurpeth5@technorati.com,Male,4.123.109.132 7,Tawnya,Genthner,tgenthner6@posterous.com,Female,238.58.35.55 8,Lukas,Gershom,lgershom7@ibm.com,Male,241.38.25.208 9,Doroteya,Mottley,dmottley8@drupal.org,Female,145.28.139.222 '''.strip() mock_data_csv_reader = DictReader(StringIO(MOCK_DATA)) print(validate_csv(mock_data_csv_reader)) -&gt; True print(validate_csv(DictReader('foo'))) -&gt; False
Is that a bad thing? If Buzzfeed did the "work" to compile these lists, one way they make money is to use affiliate links. Since this bot is scraping the work they did, why should it also remove the source of revenue? Especially since it doesn’t cost you and if you buy the item from the article, you genuinely were referred by them. There is an ethical argument about this bot removing you from having to view the site to see the content. I think it has lots of analogies to ad-blocking. Is it ethical to view the content without the revenue stream you generate? Personally, I think there is a lot of gray area. I use an ad-blocker but (a) have some amount of cognitive dissonance associated with it, (b) white list sites that aren't bad, and (c) have it allow unobtrusive ads. It's not perfect, but it works for me. I can see subscribing to this sub as kind of a less-annoying way to view the Buzzfeed articles. A happy medium is that if I buy something from an article, it should still give them the referral. With all that said, I am far from dogmatic on this! I'm interested in hearing the other side of the argument.
Thanks! Found it. 
From the looks of it, the book is just plain wrong here. I suspect it's assuming that dictionaries are being implemented as something like a balanced tree, which do effectively maintain a sorted order, but in fact, they're implemented by hashtables, which generally don't have any such property. There *was* a change in recent version of python regarding *ordering*, in that the implementation preserves **insertion** order, but that's not the same as key order, so I don't think it's what the book is talking about. (And IIRC, that's currently documented as an implemetation detail anyway - it's a bonus from certain optimisations regarding the dictionary format, not a guaranteed feature of the language).
Yes indeed. Though this is missing dependencies for standard libraries that get missed when installing from source. 
&gt; validate that each column has the correct type of data The simples way is for you to parse the file: if there's something wrong with them it'll just throw an exception when converting, and then you print the line number and line content to see what's up.
I think this exemplifies why anecdotal testing of behavior is problematic. If you use earlier versions of python (I *think* &lt;=3.5 but I may be off), you will be able to see certain behavior with the sorting. You play with different examples and convince yourself of its behavior. Only, if you don't also read the documentation, you miss that this is not a guaranteed behavior. Think of documentation like a contract! If it is there, you can be (reasonably) sure that is how it will behave. If not, all bets are off. Presumably, the authors of the book played with dictionaries and noticed their ordering. But in the documentation, it says you cannot rely on it! I recently built a workflow at work around someone else's code. I noticed it always behaved in a certain way that was not specified one way or another in the documentation. I needed to build my methods on this idiosyncrasy but that would be taking a gamble! So, before I went further, I spoke with them and agreed to make that a specification of the code behavior!

I don't really get it. 1. The code looks like auto-generated from the jpeg standards. it is not readable or maintainable by any mean. 2. Why writing a library for python 2.7? we all want to get rid of it. (a python2 pythonist here, i wish it will be depreciated asap) 3. Why all the code in single commit? where it came from?
Oh ok...it's just numpy arrays that are limited to being byte strings. The dtype I use is typically `|U8`, which is not supported. &gt; NumPy also has a Unicode type, a UTF-32 fixed-width format (4-byte characters). HDF5 has no support for wide characters. Rather than trying to hack around this and “pretend” to support it, h5py will raise an error when attempting to create datasets or attributes of this type. http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/strings.html
Yeah it is, it uses stackage. But you can add hackage packages that aren't in the stackage snapshot quite easily. 
I'm not perfectly clear on what you're trying to do but I think copy-pasting everything manually into a single sheet might take you as much time as trying to come up with any sort of automated method. I mean, it'll be a bore but it's only 50 sheets, it's not going to take you more than an hour or two at most.

You are correct, you can get any kind of crap in any column of a csv file. You shouldn't be downvoted. Equally, using pandas for this is just NO GOOD as it infers data types for itself which is certainly not what you want if you know nothing about the origin of the data. 
Have you looked into the relationship between good/bad articles and article author? Might be a good starting point for filtration rules
Have you looked into pyenv?
That's a pretty good idea. I'll look into adding that if I notice an author keeps posting terrible articles. For now the bot just filters out posts if it has keywords such as pictures, images, etc in the title, or if several subpoints start with when or this
Ah okay, I wanted to rule out the case in which you were a confused beginner.
Not yet. I lag behind for transcripts because they are not free. I'll send this off to the transcriptionist. 
Yes I think the author is confused by a change that was made in Python 3.6 where dicts remember the order items are inserted. But I would not rely on this behaviour. By the way you can use sorted(colors.items()) if you want to see the sorted key pairs. 
ahah, downvotes should give their arguments ! 
Working through a data science tutorial from Analytics Vidhya. Currently going through the Google Python Class to make sure I understand Lists, Dictionaries and regular expressions. Then will move on to the libraries most useful for data science in general. After that, I think Statistics to complement the programming knowledge.
Awesome math structure. Was fun to read about that, I hope I'll use it someday in practice :) Thanks
You should add the author as a flair
&gt; If you use earlier versions of python (I think &lt;=3.5 but I may be off), you will be able to see certain behavior with the sorting. Way off. Between 3.3 and 3.5 hash randomisation was on by default, so the order of dicts would be completely unpredictable and would change from run to run (despite completely deterministic insertions). In Python 2 and up to Python 3.2, by default you'd see deterministic but unspecified ordering (based on the hashes and the current size of the backing buffer, so the same insertions in the same order leading to the same resizes would yield the same iteration order), you could also optionally enable hash randomisation (`-R`) yielding non-deterministic ordering changing from run to run. From 3.6 onwards, dicts are *naturally ordered*, the iteration order is the order of insertion (as long as you don't have deletions).

What paths did you add and where did you get that path from? Can you run IDLE? If so, what is the output from this python code: import sys print(sys.executable) Also, show us the output from the command line command: echo %PATH%

There's tons of programs that will rip a CD / DVD, what do those not have that makes you want to write your own? 
I need the program to copy to a network location (which, as you have correctly started many third party programs can do) but then write an entry to a database within a piece of case management software. I also need it to cost as close to nothing as possible due too -some rather extreme- budget constraints for the board. 
Even utilizing all cores you are still looking at runtimes that are measured in years. Your choices are to either see if you can optimize your code to gain a magnitude or two in speed, or invest in CPU-hours on a larger machine with more cores. You probably want to do both.
Well i developed and runing scraper for a commercial product which is scrapping data from.close to 7k websites everyday. So I have scripted for every possible combination of webpage avilable as my target websites have a wide variety of data. I generally use phantomjs and beautifulsoup and for most of the sites, even the most dynamic one's this combination works perfectly fine.
Yahoo had a huge repository of freeware and source code back then. So did AOL, but it wasn't nearly as impressive.
Write a loop, open every excel sheet and append them in a new outfile. It would be straight forward, if you need to do some data manipulation, then read the data from input files and do you job and then append at the end of outfile in loop.
Ok. So if you have a program that does the copying and another that does the database insert then it would be very easy to use python to make a GUI and call those outside programs as needed. Look into `tkinter` for a simple GUI. If you want to do all the work and not call outside programs you could do that too. For simple file transfer you can use the `shutil` module.

That's the "consenting adults" part of Zen of Python. There's no reason not to use PEP8. If we all followed it, it would be a better world.

At a quick glance I'd have said both [csvvalidator](https://github.com/alimanfoo/csvvalidator) and [vladiate](https://github.com/di/vladiate) fit your needs, although if you are processing a small number of columns it might be just as easy to roll your own in pure Python. You might like to note that date validation can be a right PITA if your files are coming from different sources and hence have different formats.
To add to this: why would you use it? Install pillow already.

I'm not on one side or the other. The way I'm seeing it, this bot is meant as a way to sort of stick it to Buzzfeed by summarizing their content and posting it to a dedicated subreddit. Maybe I'm wrong in that thought, and it's not meant to stick it to Buzzfeed, but that's what I'm getting out of this thread. So I think my point, more or less, was if you are going to go to the trouble of creating a bot that takes pageviews away from Buzzfeed, then why preserve their affiliate links as well?

This isn't /r/learnpython . The code above is pretty concise for what the person is asking, but it does require some knowledge of `__new__`, `classmethod` and `super`, which isn't necessarily beginner-level, but can be looked up. Rather than complain that other people are writing code that's beyond your current level of understanding (which is fine - we all have to start somewhere), I recommend just asking about the specific thing that confuses you. I'd be more than happy to answer.
&gt; The OP actually said "to validate that each column has the correct type of data eg string, number, date Yes but dates can be represented in many ways such as integers for example. I think the bigger question is what is meant by validating. What is the particular use case and why he believes he needs to validate them. It seems to be an XY problem. &gt; Why do you need a csv module in the stdlib to read them? I don't see your point. You don't need the csv module at all to read them o.O if you want to read more about why this module was added to stdlib please read [PEP 305](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0305/) It is for parsing reasons and sometimes some particular CSVs. Reasons why some elements are within stdlib are for either efficiency reasons of for the huge reuse of a very particular algorithm. CSV files a used a lot. They are standard files for tables contrary to what most people think. Another example would be the configparser module, json module, the logging module, etc. There is no particular reason why you couldn't rewrite the whole thing with python core elements without much issue for a specific file.
&gt; Of course, it's wrong to parse HTML with regular expressions. But I'm guessing you're already doing that. You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The &lt;center&gt; cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege̿̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved the trangession of a chi͡ld ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as previously prophesied) dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of c͒ͪo͛ͫrrupt entities (like SGML entities, but more corrupt) a mere glimpse of the world of reg​ex parsers for HTML will ins​tantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming, he comes, the pestilent slithy regex-infection wil​l devour your HT​ML parser, application and existence for all time like Visual Basic only worse he comes he comes do not fi​ght he com̡e̶s, ̕h̵i​s un̨ho͞ly radiańcé destro҉ying all enli̍̈́̂̈́ghtenment, HTML tags lea͠ki̧n͘g fr̶ǫm ̡yo​͟ur eye͢s̸ ̛l̕ik͏e liq​uid pain, the song of re̸gular exp​ression parsing will exti​nguish the voices of mor​tal man from the sp​here I can see it can you see ̲͚̖͔̙î̩́t̲͎̩̱͔́̋̀ it is beautiful t​he final snuffing of the lie​s of Man ALL IS LOŚ͖̩͇̗̪̏̈́T ALL I​S LOST the pon̷y he comes he c̶̮omes he comes the ich​or permeates all MY FACE MY FACE ᵒh god no NO NOO̼O​O NΘ stop the an​*̶͑̾̾​̅ͫ͏̙̤g͇̫͛͆̾ͫ̑͆l͖͉̗̩̳̟̍ͫͥͨe̠̅s ͎a̧͈͖r̽̾̈́͒͑e n​ot rè̑ͧ̌aͨl̘̝̙̃ͤ͂̾̆ ZA̡͊͠͝LGΌ ISͮ̂҉̯͈͕̹̘̱ TO͇̹̺ͅƝ̴ȳ̳ TH̘Ë͖́̉ ͠P̯͍̭O̚​N̐Y̡ H̸̡̪̯ͨ͊̽̅̾̎Ȩ̬̩̾͛ͪ̈́̀́͘ ̶̧̨̱̹̭̯ͧ̾ͬC̷̙̲̝͖ͭ̏ͥͮ͟Oͮ͏̮̪̝͍M̲̖͊̒ͪͩͬ̚̚͜Ȇ̴̟̟͙̞ͩ͌͝S̨̥̫͎̭ͯ̿̔̀ͅ 
You can certainly piece something together with the stdlib's csv-module and Cerberus. http://python-cerberus.org
I have used your library package to make my personal website with my model research projects. But unfortunately i dont understand to scale up the .SVG format images in the website. My professor said that i have to use a scaled version of matlab based svg image files. But the package CSS or BOOTSTRAP rules in your static directory files restrict me to scale the image even if i add them as high resolution images. How will i do that. 
Thank you so much. I will post this questions elsewhere. To answer your question, I honestly didn't know. I don't know if it's OK to start a new fxn withIN a fxn or if it matters.
A function within a function is called a "nested function" and generally we don't do that. Make a new function outside of the function you are in and call it. def remove_vowels(word): # beep boop return result def madlibs(): word_without_vowels = remove_vowels(word)
[There's a great book about how to do that.](http://hawramani.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/parsing_html_with_regex.png)
A few years ago I read a thing about what it's like to work as a writer at Buzzfeed. Basically they each have to turn in like three articles a day, no matter what the quality level is. 
Does it support "recording" to create your first tests ?
It's kinda both. It is wrong in how it's worded with "notice how it's sorted." Because it's not actually sorted in the photo in the book, and because you can't *see* how it's sorted. But it's misleading, because the keys are stored as a sorted table of hashes. So a dict *is* sorted. Just not in a way that a human can use.
There’s already a Python book based on this premise: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
Oh OK, you're right. I didn't realize that.
I believe the correct answer is: I will make it legal.
I like your usage of “while True” with “continue” to try again and “break” to successfully quit. I’m stealing that construct for my Twitter bot but since it can suffer a lengthy outage when connecting to the page that it scrapes I’ll only try 4~5 times in a hour and give up.
Have you tried Heroku?
Learn python 3 through the standard library is also a great book for this
Why would you? A Docker container would have its own internal python instance so you wouldn't need one. Just make a new container for each environment you need.
I know how to do it. I was just wondering if there was some repo somewhere that already had a lot of scripts meant for automation of tasks. Make sense? 
I know how to do it. I was just wondering if there was some repo somewhere that already had a lot of scripts meant for automation of tasks. Make sense? 
Idk, honestly I just want to learn what is the best practice for Docker. Went through [this](https://www.theodo.fr/blog/2015/04/docker-and-virtualenv-a-clean-way-to-locally-install-python-dependencies-with-pip-in-docker/) article. &gt; Another way to locally isolate you project is to install your dependencies in a docker container (actually the best practice would be to use virtualenv in a docker container as described here: https://hynek.me/articles/virtualenv-lives). It says the ideal solution is to wrapped the app twice.
Try /r/learnpython. But they won't do it for you; you will have to show what you have done and describe where you are stuck. 
Interesting. I do like that idea. I know I tried it for like 20 minutes one time and noticed it was still using the docker container's global python instance even though I sourced the virtualenv. Didn't feel like screwing with it further
Each RUN statement is effectively run in a separate shell from the previous RUN statement. So if you actually wanted your commands run in a virtualenv you would need to do . venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; your command here for each RUN line. I would recommend using the "system Python" in a Docker container and not using virtualenvs in Docker. You do not need to use venvs in a docker container. It's overly complicated and probably provides no benefit unless you have a very specific use-case.
This is probably the coolest thing I have seen made with Python. Maybe not the most impressive, but the slickness is undeniable.
I use the time.sleep to have it only try every 15 minutes. Having it constantly trying to check the connection is a bad idea
You should use whatever style the rest of your project uses. I would use PEP 8 for new projects only. And even then the 80 character limit can fuck off and die. Someone who cares should add a new API to logging. That's in stdlib and still using (I think it's log4j's) naming and api design.
Maybe this is more what your looking for then: https://github.com/realpython/python-scripts
I'm asking the user to pick a noun and then I want to take whatever noun they use and remove the vowels. This is where I'm getting hung up. word6 = requestString("Please say a Noun: ")
To be fair, he never said they were sorted.
/u/behold_the_j showed you some code that does that. Did you try it? 
I'll give it a try, but the noun/verb is undefined until the user inputs it. I need to have code that will work on whatever noun/verb they put in. 
And if not, do not try running full verification tests for 3.6 in 2 days and patching on a Friday...
Been trying to make a checkout bot for supremenewyork.com I learned Java in school and I'm really enjoying using python. I'm making the bot using beautifulsoup and requests. I've made a GUI for it using tkinter and pyqt. Next, I am thinking of doing some side projects to put on github since I am still a student and I feel like it would help make my resume look nice. I've been planning on using flask to make a webapp using Gmail's API to allow a user to either unsubscribe from all spam emails, or choose which ones they want to unsubscribe from. Its been a little confusing integrating oauth with Flask, but I think I'm getting the hang of it!
Still on 2.7, so no.
That article makes valid points but I feel it's still unnecessary to run your app in a virtualenv in a Docker container unless you run into a specific problem that requires it.
for loop through the urls use requests inside the loop to get the request.content parse request.content with BeautifulSoup use the find all function in beatufiulsoup to find all &lt;a&gt;'s append these to a list use a with open statement, loop the previous list and do f.write()
It was effectively EOL well over a year ago. They sat on security patches for over a year, and didn't backport security patches that made it into 3.4+. Honestly, if you are going to work with 3.x, you should probably plan on updating minor versions about once a year.
It's actually a great selling point for the people who complain about Atom updating too frequently or Sublime updating once in a blue moon. There are many people in both of those categories.
I feel like VSCode (with the Python Extension Pack) is a fantastic middle-ground between a feature-bloated IDE and a text editor. You don't have the overhead or feature creep of a full IDE while still getting an IDE's most important features (in my opinion) like Intellisense, linting, unit tests, snippets, etc., all of which you can use or completely ignore at your discretion.
Don't forget because it is a "normal" text editor, you can use it for other languages as well, many of which have their own add-ons.
Yes
&gt; AWS' free tier will only last a year AWS Lambda (serverless code execution) has a free tier that lasts indefinitely. It is measured in number of executions and memory-seconds the script runs in a month (okay, I admit the pricing is convoluted, but it's not a bad deal when you run the numbers). More information on pricing [here](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/). They also just recently updated to Python 3.x, which is a step forward in the world!
As a climber, I think this is pretty slick
This isn't the reason either...
 Just did a project with chromedriver and Selenium. It was a dream compared to BS. Of course, it's a bit more resource intensive, but still. 
Still struggling to get my organization off 2.*5*, so, no.
Given that other projects dropped support for it ~1.5 years ago, I did too. I still support Python 2.7, but 3.3 is this weird in-between. At least it's better than 3.2.
Actually that’s a ‘yes’
Always been on 3.6, i wouldnt know.
What about against nightly master builds? 
Google app engine standard is free and you can set up a cron job on it. Python 2.7
Cool!
2.6.6 with spark 1.6.0. Take that!
Just edited the .travis.yml files that still had it. Thanks for the heads-up.
For example, in 1997, as a professional software developer, the only practical way I could get my hands on a copy of Linux to experiment with was to buy a disk set at a brick and mortar software store. 
Good god. That rules out like 80% of stack overflow
[Here's a link the the data] (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/)
lol no generics
I have 2.5 running on Plan 9. I hate it.
We've been running 3.5.x since it came out (Type Hinting, ftw!) -- All of our code runs fine on 3.6 as well. I think we're ready.
You could raise an exception instead of return if the number is prime. I don't see the point in this exercise though.
1) /r/learnpython (see notes in sidebar) 2) what makes you sure there is something to print the second time around? did you check that?
Can’t tell if you’re sarcastically describing PyPI or not. 
As a climber and someone learning Python, this is amazing. Thanks for sharing! 
Are they going to release a Python 4 that's incompatible with 3 now?
Me neither tbh. I'm just not allowed to use return for whatever the reason is.. I'm new to python so how that exception should be implemented in my code?
Mind sharing what life long project/product you're working on? That must be hell. 
Hahaha. Implying we'll ever get away from 2.x. oh you.
Ask your teacher. We're not going to do your homework for you.
Sorry Samm, you gotta do your own homework. 
Hah!
I'm on my phone so I can't type much. I would create a new exception class that holds a true/false value and catch that specific type in the caller
Could you detect vibrations or gauge the amount of ongoing wear and tear?
Thank you, I see. Yes, you were right on what I was trying to accomplish. I was checking for unique values(sentences) and if unique the sentence would be added to the master list until a non-unique sentence was encountered. Then the program would terminate. Because I wrote everything as I went along, the variables were all inside the loop (Only 4 variables I had outside of the loop and these were just defining the lists that contained the verbs/nouns/adj/Sentence_Template). Realized I screwed up when I got to the last requirement for the project where it stated to restart the program and append the sentence to the list. First program I've attempted to write, I'll learn eventually. 
functions have no parens now! just say()
Mmm, fist.
I really liked this project. I saw a few things that could be improved, Python-wise, so I forked the project and made some changes. It won't make the bot any better, but I figured you might appreciate a few tips. https://github.com/boppreh/BuzzFeed-Reddit-Bot/pull/1 (Note this is a pull request in my own fork. The changes I made were all untested, so I was afraid you could accept the pull request and break the bot in some horrible way.)
Taking the best of VBA. 
Exactly. It's my editor of choice for pretty much anything more complicated than minor three-second edits. And I'd use it for those too if it would open faster, but it's pretty much as fast as an Electron app can be at this point.
I would still be maintaining a python 2.5 web app also, if I hadn't been laid off a year ago. Greatest thing that ever happened to me was getting out of there! Now I can play with Python 3 like all the cool kids and stop trying to dredge up old versions of modules and work around ancient bugs.
What breaking changes occur between 2.5 and 2.7?
Wow thank you so much for this. I'm fairly new to python so this feedback is really helpful! I'll definitely update the code when I get the chance with all of your modifications in mind
28 pages of questions in 2nd test? fuck this shit!
With your zero details provided about what you’re doing, the video formats you’re using, or really anything else how do you expect anyone to help? MoviePy is a wrapper on top of `ffmpeg`. Typically `ffmpeg` will not have any hardware decoding or encoding support, This means MoviePy’s speed will be entirely dependent on your system’s ability to decode and encode video. If your source video is high bitrate 1080p video on a slower machine when you output the edited video it’s going to take a while. If the source has super long keyframe intervals your slow system needs to decode all the frames in a keyframe group in order to do any work on those frames. I don’t know what MoviePy means by it/s, with video encoding and decoding frames per second is a useful measurement, pixels or blocks per second would be meaningful as well. If you’re on a slow PC but want to play with MoviePy work with lower resolution videos. The fewer pixels/macroblocks you need to encode and decode the faster you’ll get tasks done faster. 
It depends on the problem. I'll be happy if I find a single solution to a 200 variable optimization problem, so there are 200 roots. Often it's not the best, so you bump it to help it along. Newton's method is pretty good. Also, simplify your problem as much as you can.
I feel like I'm reading an hidden spy message/recruitment message. 
 `float('2.5d+3')` doesn't work.
My assumption is that your browser is closing the connection, even though I don't see a reason too, but depending on how long that stuff takes to parse/render it very well is the most likely answer. There is no connection keep alive, and I don't see you sending the data in a standard protocol.
You don't know what you want to build but you want someone's help? I am always done for more projects but I would need more information to ensure my time isn't properly wasted.
A lot of people will switch when 2.7 shuts down. My company hasn't switched, but it's coming.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; message = 'hey, i am an attorney who is Looking to team up with somEone and build someThing. i dont know what yet but i am looking to talk with Someone about builDing sOmeTHIng. message me and we can chat. then we can Start to build.' &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join([chr for chr in message if chr.istitle()]) 'LETSDOTHIS'
What is that string intended to mean? Evaluate arithmetic within the float?
ETAS and dSpace are still on old versions depending on what versions of those you have. https://www.etas.com/en/products/solutions_labcar_component_overview.php https://www.dspace.com/en/inc/home.cfm 
We'll probably never move on from 2.7
seriously, will there be python 4 in the near future?
pffff lots are still having to work with 2.6 and even earlier. I do, because when I get in a customer's server I have to work with whatever they have there, most of them use Red Hat or Centos with an ancient version of python. The programed EOL means nothing, 2.x will finally leave once it dissapears from the servers, and that won't happen for quite some time.
No not at all. I actually didn't reply to the right post. 
Yes! More like that! I was also wondering if there is a centralized place for something like that for the entire Python community to share their scripts? Like a much bigger repo or website or something. Preferably a big repo though
I actually think using a virtualenv in Docker is a good idea becaues it makes things consistent. This is what we've been doing at work in production for years. The issue you actually have here is that `source` does not exist in the sh shell that Docker is using here. So to fix that error, you would have to use `RUN . venv/bin/activate`. But that would not be enough because the environment variables `activate` sets would be lost in the next command. As [mentioned by rfc1771](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/72v16x/how_can_i_have_virtualenv_set_in_a_docker/dnloczf/), each RUN command is independent. To actually activate your virtualenv, use `ENV PATH="/venv/bin/activate:${PATH}"` (using an absolute path to remove ambiguity). You can also run pip3 and python3 directly from the env: RUN venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt RUN venv/bin/python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput Also, consider using venv which is faster than virtualenv and just as nice.
You need a cluster, or you need to optimize your code, or most likely both. Find out what high-performance computing resources your school has access to and see how much money it's going to cost. You'll likely end up with a simpler process. I would guess your supervisor doesn't have enough money to do what you want right now. Your problem sounds like it's trivially parallelizable, so all you need to do is split the data points up into many cluster job submissions, save the output, and then stitch the output back together afterwards. I have run many projects with a total cost of 10-20 CPU years, but this was generally spread-out over 80, 16-core nodes. 
I still support 2.4...I do work for about 3 weeks once a year. Mostly, I bug fix by backporting libraries. I still use PyQt3. 
`pip install sympy` 
It's a double precision float. It's standard Fortran notation.
Well, we have until 2020: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/ I've been leading the deprecation at my workplace, basically there are now policies that say any py2 software is maintenance only and all new stuff has to be python 3.6+. The biggest problem people have so far? print()
That's what my boss says. It's annoying to change, but mehh. I just acknowledge that and well, Python 3.6 is the first version of Python better than 2.7 (per Raymond Hettinger). He complains about that because he hasn't dealt with unicode...at least it's solvable with Python 3.
you can do anything with code. I need something to build have you been planning anything that I can help on?
Not a very hard one. Have anything you have wanted to build?
I don't need help. Just looking for someone who wants to build something. Brain storm and then build it. 
LOL.Yes, that certainly wouldn’t be a good idea.
What languages are you proficient in? Design background? Marketing? Are you looking small or large scale? Web app? Mobile app? Desktop app? That's the information I am kinda looking for. I code in Python almost every day. I am well versed in JS, Java, and HTML/CSS. I have worked with ASP.Net, C#, C, and VB.Net. I have built web, desktop, and mobile apps at an enterprise and small business level. So just making sure interests align. There are many projects and ideas to build or expand on... but if the team isn't a good fit it's never going to get completed.
Yeah, unicode can get hinky in 3.x (depending on who you ask! RIP inbox). Not my article but a fun rant about it: http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/7/2/the-updated-guide-to-unicode/ and then something helpful: http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/
According to your post history, you went from having limited coding experience to being very confident in python in a span of about 2 weeks. Remarkable!
Is it really so difficult to move from 3.3 to any other 3.x &gt; 3.3? I haven't noticed any breaking changes.
It will be longer than that. Redhat 7 doesn't EOL until 2024 and the extended support is longer yet. I won't be done with 2.7 until that happens.
Autodesk FBX still only supporting 2.7 and 3.3. But you do get 32bit and 64bit flavours: http://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2018/ENU/?guid=FBX_Developer_Help_scripting_with_python_fbx_platforms_supported_html
The *typing* module alone is one reason a wouldn't work on anything below 3.5. It's not only the type annotations, it's also constructs like this one (available since 3.6) which make the language a lot more pleasant to work with: class Foo(NamedTuple): bar: str baz: int qux: list fred = Foo('hello', 42, [1, 2]) 
Oh, man. You know it. I found Python much more difficult to work with prior to `typing` module.
No, it's not.
Python for sure. I'm an attorney by trade but taught my self Python and c++ I'd say I'm intermediate level. Probably want to build a web app large scale project. Building an E-classroom primarily leveraging Google docs. Tailoring to language tutoring but could be for any thing. I have a post in my history that is kinda the thing I have in mind. I am open for anything. I am just stuck and don't know we're to begin. 
VSCode opens fast, 2-3 seconds. Visual Studio takes a while 10+ seconds. Are you confusing the two or is it just slow for you? Also have you tried the new 64-Bit version, it is alot faster for me.
VBA has a “best” feature in the same way that Bedbugs Budget Motor Inn has a “best” room. 
I was timid and didn't want to oversell. I'm confident I can create it's just I'm having a tough time coming up with something to create. 
Does anyone see a need for breaking changes that would warrant a 4.0?
http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html Based on the frequency of release cycles it would drop in 2023, or hopefully a few Presidents from now. They have said no breaking changes like the 2 to 3 transition and expect it will come after 3.9. In other words the devs anticipate a change to Linux kernel like incremental development cycle where the version number is just a counter. 
Wait what? I was in high school in 1997 and I could download a distro like Slackware or Red hat, normally over ftp, and either install from floppies or burn a CD. 
Sure. There are no major differences between 3.3 and 3.4
working on a web based network monitoring tool using django. any suggestions highly appreciated
But..... This is python. So why the +3?
Is this equivalent to a C-style format string of e.g. `printf("%.3f", 2.5);`, as in `2.500`? Fortran's peak was _well_ before my time so please excuse the confusion.
The links of https://laughinggoat.github.io/mp_tick_data.html (Note 2) don't work.
Huh, cool. It was faster to make this than to look up other options though haha edit: And mid3v2 doesn't appear to support m4a, whereas mutagen supports mp3/m4a tags with a single function, so it was easy to support both in my tool. They're the formats I end up dealing with the most.
Evidence management software ....
&gt; What would the flag be used for? Set `True` on a frame if it was executed. Coverage would be essentially bytecode level. No source instrumentation was needed. &gt; Right now I think there's probably not much need for any sort of fundamental rearchitecting of how coverage works I consider bytecode coverage for a language I would like to compile to Python bytecodes ( via AST -&gt; AST transformation ). So I would have code coverage for free. 
3.6 all the way. I'm actually working on a port of an open source library from 2.7 to 3.6.
Use Pavtube [ByteCopy](http://www.multipelife.com/bytecopy). It works great. I prefer lossless BD/DVD to MKV backup. 
I don't use it regularly but it's really useful to give PyCharm a hint for tab completion. Updated our environment to 3.6 just for that ;-)
Not a C guy, but I don't think so. It's just a form of scientific notation. You use a D for double 64-bit float vs the more common 32 bit float. Just pretend the d is an e. A code I commonly use also uses that format, so I parse it. It also has 1.23+3, so 1.23e3, which is a short form for a 32-bit float in scientific notation. That of course leads to 0.+5, which is 0.
It's scientific notation, which is eqivalent to 2.5e+3 or 2500.0. Fortran uses a D or d to indicate a double vs a float. Python supported it until 2.7.
3.4 added support for unicode in struct objects and so did Python 2.7.7. They effectively broke backwards compatibility with that move on my project 
Actually, I haven't really taken the time to compare in a while. VSCode's gotten a lot faster lately, hasn't it? I seem to remember the delay being a lot longer, but then I'm comparing to Sublime, which opens near-instantaneously. It does seem to be down to 3-4 seconds at this point.
Usually when a server write back to the browser it's done as one continuous write, not a bunch of prints. Perhaps collect all the HTML into a single string and write it once at the end of the run?
You might want to checkout [ordereddict](https://pymotw.com/2/collections/ordereddict.html)
 they've said they'll probably get to 4.0 as a mostly incremental update but it shouldn't have major breaking changes like 2-3. 
You can't just pass a list of strings. JSON is basically like a python dictionary. You need to format your object as a dictionary e.g. {"strings":[string1, string2, string3]} Each string above is a string object. It's better to pass each string though with a dictionary keyword so it's easier to extract later, or nested dictionaries if you need nester data storage. Serialising converts python objects to JSON but it has to be something that has similar properties to JSON in terms of structure. Python has that in dictionaries, so we feed it dictionaries. Read up on JSON and how it looks. You'll recognize the similarities instantly.
Hey, i'm building a pretty large scale project. I don't know if you are interested in building console and development tools. I'm using PyQt5 for the GUI. Since you know both C++ and Python, it should be easy for you jump into. It's a free and open source project(similar to spyder-ide) for the benefit of the python community. Project: https://github.com/AlphaHooks/AlphaHooks
/r/DoMyHomework is over there ---&gt;
I couldnt find an Expected.Condition, that waits for user to input something. I did it like this: try: element = WebDriverWait(driver, 60).until( EC.url_matches(r"https\:\/\/subdomain\.domain\.com\/ticket\/\d{7}") ) finally: print ("Ticket opened") but i think this kind of sucks, right?
People think unicode is easy in python 2 because the interpreter doesn't tell them their code is broken in python 2 when it does in 3.
You can try Godot. It's an open source game engine with an integrated IDE, pretty similar to Unity. Godot 2.0 uses a language called GDscript that is very similar to Python, and Godot 3.0 (currently in alpha) has Python bindings. 
Thanks for the info, I will check it. But I really want to learn unity. If python cant do it, I will go with C#.
thanks :)
Only hours of upgrading and dependencies.
:( so no proper parallelism then. That's my only caveat with python. There are workarounds but it would be great to have something at the base level even below stdlib so all your multiculti is managed on OS level and not inside the interpreter. Shared by default objects? Concurrency from the box? Sign me up!
Actually, they are talking about integrating changes to remove the GIL, which would allow proper parallelism. And you may not even have to wait for 4.0, I seem to remember reading somewhere they were taking about potentially having it in Python 3.7 or 3.8.
Why specifically do you want to learn Unity? I used Unity for a long time and it is indeed powerful, but I've found Godot just as powerful if not more so due to it being lightweight and able to run on every system (I got it running on a raspberry pi), and open source so if you ever do need to change something about it you just can. 
Considering how hard people are working to get programming languages away from concurrently-modifiable shared state I’m curious why you’re so desperate to move toward it...
It'd be nice if we could write Python that doesn't concurrently modify things and gets rewarded by being easy to really multithread.
We migrated from 2.5 a couple of years ago… to 2.7 :) It's great here, migrating to 3 will be a massive endeavour (but I secretly plan for it whenever I get the time, of course).
I'm not interested until Python 4.0 aka 'Pythonica' ;)

In the sense that cobol and windows xp can still be found in the wild, i am sure python 2 will remain. but would you start a new project with those tomorrow?
if it was working in 2, was it really broken? i mean it might work because two bugs you don't know about cancel out, but that's still working and many people would not consider that an "unintentional work-around" needed fixing. dont get me wrong. i dont use 2 at all and have no intention of doing do, but i have learned that breakage is pretty subjective. ( i personally would fix those bugs, but i'm not representative of everyone )
You're a scummy cunt.

An array by itself is valid JSON. And in many contexts, simple values such as `null`, `true`, `5.4` and `"foo"` are also valid JSON. But many api frameworks only accept JSON objects. I think that's probably the case with DRF too.

Oh no python 3.3 will end ohhhh nooo my lfie has no meaning... just kidding , java master race all the way 
Hello friend, I use Paramiko a lot for work; while I can't share our actual code with you, I can share with you an approximate example that should get you where you want to go. It can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/initialed85/9d876298121da568a5bdc72b438fcf9e) It'll only get you so far; I've found Paramiko to have some odd behaviour with timeouts and to behave best when used non-blocking. For your use case though, I think something simple should suffice. However, to extend on all of that- a Python library called "Fabric" might provide a way to automate some remote device stuff via SSH- it basically wraps up a lot of what you're trying to achieve (and what's in that gist I've linked).
Do you need to have the separate is_prime function? Because you can just paste that code inside the main function and `yield` and count when it is a prime. Btw normally you would do if is_prime(): without and `== True` or `is True`, as `if` already compares to True.
Python 2 allows you to write error-free "Unicode" aware code that only works with ascii. Python 3 correctly informs you of these bugs and explodes on you in all cases. Python 2 will function with ascii test data and only explode once you get actual Unicode in production for example. In other words "If it was working in 2, was it really broken?" Yes. Yes it was. It's just that there are quite a few applications that most of the time only have to handle ascii anyways, so there's a bunch of people who are miffed when their assumedly Unicode compliant code suddenly doesn't work in python 3 when it never supported Unicode to begin with. These people should either move to actually support Unicode or change their application to only support ascii. But most importantly move away from the hybrid lie in between where they think they support Unicode when in actuality their application only supports ascii. Python 3 does the correct thing by informing the developer that the code they've written does not do what they think. Ie. the Unicode aware code does not work with the whole gamut of Unicode, and so it errors out.
Hi, thanks i'll look into that, Paramikos behaviour really does seem odd though. One would expect that they'd include an exception for a timeout since they do include the timeout.
I found to get the Paramiko timeouts working (at least for what I was doing, remote shell stuff) I had to specify a timeout, a banner_timeout, override the global socket timeout and I also used manually controlled timeouts while doing non-blocking stuff. In the Paramiko context though, with your script being stuck waiting for input, it hasn't timed out, strictly speaking- if you were to tcpdump the traffic between yourself and the server, the TCP connection is up and passing traffic all fine- timeout is more to do with "I expected to receive a keepalive from the SSH server and I didn't, so throw an exception"
I glued together the csv module and the marshallow library together, to do the exact thing you ask. It's called csvalidate. Here is an example code: https://github.com/Shir0kamii/csvalidate/blob/master/examples/validate_format.py using it is pretty straightforward if you know marshmallow, but you should look it up anyway if you don't, as it's a great validation library.

I put stuff like that in github gists, along with anything else I need to share as a single file.
There is no need to activate each command. Instead, just give the full path to the python version in the virtual environment. Here’s how I’ve gotten it to work: http://www.djangocurrent.com/2017/06/django-docker-and-celery.html?m=1
Do you have any you can share? 
Looking at making an NN that learns and plays Minecraft with a Python wrapper that gets information from a Java wrapper for Spigot. 
The problem with concurrently modifiable shared state is corruption. If we can return error (and python doesn't do that by default even up to segfault) to requestor such problem wouldn't exist. Seriously if you need a local state just use the local variable. If you want global variable well let it get locked everytime a thread writes to it? Is it so difficult? With proper memory management it could've been superfast and reliable. Databases do it, so can python. I'm tired of loading a random third party messaging library to just get a common task for several tasklets without corruption along the way. All it need is atomic detectable changes (so if in another task you read the flag .in_progress it is done after another task sets it atomically without any interruption).
This. Wouldn't it be nice to append to a global list in a thread function? Few locks here and there, but why not? We have asyncdef why can't we have threaddef? p.s.: I still don't understand why we need asyncdef instead of def and other cludges for async. Why couldn't we just have decorators for that and expand their usage to other syntax elements? That way implementing threading natively would be much easier (though I still would prefer it to be in the background operated by interpreter).
I found this, but seems incomplete, https://github.com/gustavospiess/GeneticPie I don't know if it will help, good luck
We have tools in 2.7 and tools in 3.5+. So far, so good. 
I know this isn't exactly what you are asking but honestly I think you are better off just using C#. When you run into issues or want to learn something new, most stuff will be in C#. I prefer using python for most stuff, but when I'm working on games in Unity I use C# and honestly it works well for what I'm doing. You have to use the right tools for the job, and a lot of the time I find python is a good tool, but with Unity I think it's C#.
You should have been performing minor upgrades the entire time from 3.2-3.6, there are very few breaking changes for minor releases.
I'm guessing these are *data* disks.
Tysm, I will try to tinker with it as I'm new to programming.
It depends on your level of Python proficiency and whether the task might repeat. For me, I imagine I could write the script in under an hour, so there would be a time savings for 50 files, but maybe not for 5 or so. 
I wish qpython would update (it's on 3.3 or 3.2) or someone would make something better
&gt; They are standard files There's the problem, they're not standard, hence the csv module. What happens if you want a comma in your field, e.g. a numeric that uses comma as the separator, not period? What happens if you have a string that has a double quote in it? Do you now understand?
What's confusing me after 17 years of writing Python is why you need `__new__` or `classmethod` for such a simple piece of code. Have you forgotten the Python mantra `readability counts`?
No it wouldn't. PEP8 should be rewritten to do away with those stupid, time wasting underscores and use camelcase instead :-)
I've never contributed to an open source project before, however I have been looking to find one to start and I think I could possibly be of help here. I've been using PyQt5 for the GUI of all of my projects at my job for the past 3 years and would be more than willing to help contribute.
What a coincidence, been looking for something like that for quite some time!
But everyone using Python3... Is on 3.6, right? *Goes to check version*
Console and mobile are more important than raspberry pi. I seems that they (godot) do support those platforms but not fully, or require you to jump through many hoops. The website only advertises desktop support. There are other issues relating to the availability of assets and employment. Im not saying godot is bad as they have driven commercial games, but you have to have a strong case for it, as opposed to Unity where no-one is going to yell at you for picking it unless you’re trying to build something that pushes the boundaries of current technology (like crysis, or a massive voxel mmo). And you wouldnt be using godot for that either.
Yes I am. I have never dabbled in console tools. How can I assist you? I have plenty of free time. 
I'd love to help. I have a bunch of free time. 
That's interesting. Starting with a sorted index, and matching the values to that index. 
I've been porting some old systems (read: ancient, mission critical windows batch files with no redundancy or failsafes) at my office to Python 3.6 in docker containers. Convincing them to keep it up to date is going to be interesting. The hard work is going to be convincing them to update ArcGIS so that it finally has 3.x support.
how fast would it sort [-23209, 523938, 3] ?
It's kinda like how once you use f strings, you can't go back to `format`. It's so clunky in comparison!
It wasn't broken at all, whatsoever, as long as your audience was from an english speaking country only.
Oh nice, I didn't know you could do that 
Lucky - our stack is still on 2.4 and that’s unlikely to change any time soon. 
Where did `run` come from, how is it using `timers`? "Your README does not contain valid code"
That's kindof like an inverted bucket sort. Instead of visiting the elements, you visit the buckets.
Well, mine isn't. ;) It mostly serves as an SSH server for various idiotic things I'm trying out. That being said, I do know there are a few people on the 9fans mailing list (and probably some on the Discord) that use Plan 9 commercially; IIRC there was 9pcloud and some web servers.
Nice, I could try to contribute some simple stuff. 
check the sources.. Readme gives just an overview of the usage
Not really, except that in it's a very inefficient way to do it. This approach of gathering all elements satisfying an ordered criteria (ie. is each letter of the alphabet) and emitting those in order is better achieved with what's called a *bucket sort*. Your approach is essentially doing the same, except you're only filling one bucket at a time, and doing multiple passes instead of bucketing in one pass. Instead of iterating multiple times, you can do everything in a single pass if you just record how many you've seem. Eg consider: buckets = collections.defaultdict(list) for x in assignedLetters: buckets[x].append(x) for l in alphabet: sortedLetters += buckets[l] In fact, for your usecase (only sorting single letters), we don't even need a list - you could just **count** the letters and then emit that many. eg: letters = collections.Counter(assignedLetters) for letter in alphabet: sortedList += [letter] * letters[letter] For more general cases (eg. multicharacter strings, rather than single letters), you can do stuff like combine approaches (eg. put into buckets based on the first letter, then either fall back to another sorting strategy for each bucket, or just repeat the process based on the second letter (this approach is called a Radix sort).
Very, you can get the data from pretty much anything 
Typed NamedTuples? You just blew my mind.
When installing from source it doesn't install all of stdlib's dependencies.
Well, since we collected linear acceleration data, measuring vibration would just be how much noise is in the graph. I'm not sure what you mean by ongoing wear and tear.
Because you code around quirks. It's better from a compatibility standpoint if you import unicode_literals when you're dealing with unicode and bytes. The six module doesn't convert unicode to ascii using the b/bytes function under Python&lt;3. 2.7.6 and below require that my struct have inputs of bytes. Then TravisCI stopped working on my build of Python 3.3 due to some package not building, so I dropped that. Regarding 2.6, nobody used it, my dependencies dropped official support for it (the mostly still work; pyInstaller had python 2.4 specific things it it last time I checked but also incompatible list comprehensions). It became inconvenient to support. 5 years later my boss wanted to use Python 2.7.5 with his LTS Linux and I just laughed. If I don't test against it, I don't support it.
On 2.6.6 in a bunch of places. . . I feel your pain.
Yes and no.

Nop, Just looked what you described, I'm not really sure what it does
I added C:\Users\Arthur\Documents which is where I moved my Python file to. The Python file is only a single file, though -- that I moved from my downloads folder -- rather than being in a folder of its own. I got this from your code: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; C:\Users\Arthur\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\pythonw.exe Thank you for helping me, by the way. :) I'd be lost without help.
I'm a programmer and not much of a biologist, although I have some understanding of the basics. I'm not sure I fully understand what you're getting at but I think you should have no issue creating a python library to do what you want. In fact, I'd be happy to help you write the solution! Can you provide me a little more in depth description of what you're trying to achieve and maybe a better description of what the inputs are and what the outputs are?
~~New or not, it's O( n^2 ). :-(~~ Spoke too soon. Explanation below. :-) 
Guido thinks people don't understand semver, so he wants to avoid 3.10, calling it 4.0 instead. At least that's my understanding of it.
This seems like a problem that could be solved by object oriented programming, you could create objects for gene, mRNA, and proteins ,complexes and other stuff. Then people could create an object name by the gene, and then you could create function that would do the different biological functions that you can do with that object. So you could have gene.transcribe(), would create a gene for the mRNA, and then it could have a toString() method that would output the information you want.
Who the fuck are those guys
I'm a programmer, but first I was a chemist! I'd love to help out with this, it sounds quite interesting. Python is absolutely able to handle this, in fact any general purpose language could. You'll (OP) need to come up with a comprehensive specification to really get development going.
If OP is willing, we can get an open source project going. But he'll need to help me get a bit better of an idea of what he's looking for first.
I don't see any GIL removal without backwards incompatible changes. I mean if we want to remove GIL and keep it fast we'll need to change some fundamental behaviour of the interpreter
Would comparing two runs of the same equipment show increasing variation before a failure or required maintenance? (There has been some mechanical failures on rides lately...)
I definitely need to optimize my code. And yes, thank you, I have never heard of clusters before. Is that basically what I said but in a different language?
That would be incredible! I'm at work using my phone right now so Itll have to be when I'm home, but I'll post more comprehensive design document to start with. I'd love for this project to become open source, but I don't want to get to ahead of myself being that I don't even have a rough prototype or anything yet :) 
Awesome! It'd be nice if we could get an IM chat going somewhere to discuss details.
And here's me, just upgraded from 2.7 to 3.5, not even aware that 3.3 was effectively being used.
Yes, thank you I agree and am aware. I was just trying to understand how it worked. I figured if my intuition was correct I could get access to a computer w/more cores. So basically my intuition was correct? I can split the problem into parts and each part will run on a separate core? As it is now written the code doesn't take advantage of separate cores...
I also came to the same conclusion. Thanks for the reply!
While the data could certainly be modeled with objects, it would be best to pull the methods out into a separate module. The API would become something like transcribe(gene) rather than gene.transcribe(). This frees up the function to be passed around since functions are first class in Python. With my limited understanding of OP'a requirement, it sounds like he may want to create some mapping between some criteria and some transformation that should take place. Being able to pass around these transformations could help to make this mapping process more trivial.
Eh, I don't know about that. I like using `format` still. I tried f-strings, but didn't think they looked as clean. Maybe I should try them again to see if I can get used to them. Thanks for the reminder.

You lost me
It was hideously and insidiously broken. One great thing about Python is it gives you reasonable error messages. With unicode, if I do something like this in Python 2.7 without unicode_literals imported and no default encoding set (what people do when they don't use unicode): print string + unicode It will first upconvent the string to unicode using a decode operator so string+unicode is now unicode and then promptly encode it back to binary, where it will crash with an encode error, but only if the unicode contained actual unicode characters as opposed to ASCII characters that happened to be in unicode. You first need to decode string and yet you're getting an encode error. Unicode is an unsolvable problem in Python 2. Error messages are often backwards of what you need to do. It doesn't guide you in the slightest and you have to be perfect to get it right. The great news is, once you go make your library Python 3 compatible, you solve the unicode problem in Python 2.7. You can maintain backwards compatibility easily, while making sure Python 3 works.
Perl \#FTW
Oops $ ./python --version Python 3.5.2 It's whatever looked recent last time I played with ML stuff.
Please make your point. I don't see anything that contradicts what I said. It is a fact the csv file is a text file just as .py files are text files. &gt; There's the problem, they're not standard, hence the csv module. I still don't see your point. If you're talking about EOF characters in most modern systems they are optional. &gt; What happens if you want a comma in your field, e.g. a numeric that uses comma as the separator, not period? What happens if you have a string that has a double quote in it? This whole point makes no sense. You are talking about the content and not the container... You are confusing them both. Also the OP stated that he has a specific file. So he is not writing a script to parse and validate every imaginable csv file in existence... In this case programming is used to solve a specific problem. Usually validation implies an exact idea of that the content should look like. Whatever validation means in context of a csv file.
Well... He's not wrong, but why break semver for the people who won't understand when going to 4.0 for no good reason will also be confusing and breaks with the version numbering of the last 20 years?
I don't like it either, but I think he wants it to be very friendly for people who are new to programming.
**First**, you're complaining as someone who didn't even ask the original question. I took the time to write something up as an example of how he/she might to about solving their problem and they're free to just ignore it or ask for clarification. And rather than saying something constructive like, "this is probably too complex or confusing, here's a way to do the same thing differently..." you said something that made you come across as a whiny teenager -- not someone with 17 years of coding (not to mention life) experience. **Second**, I agree with you that readability counts. As a matter of personal preference, I would rather make the tradeoff of having my validation logic in the constructor of a **value** type and know that any time I use an instance of that type, that it's valid. Then, for rows or observations, I think that having a simple NamedTuple with whatever alternate constructors (which it just so happens `classmethod`s are useful for in Python) makes sense. The complexity is always there, but I would rather have it at the "lower" level and then have the higher-level api's (see the `validate_csv` function above -- it's perfectly clear what's going on) have less logic in them.
What are you trying to accomplish? The bash alias is only going to affect you typing "python" into the terminal, nothing else. There's a lot of linux programs that need python2 and most of them use the "python" call, so you can't just globally change that command. The best thing to do is just get used to typing "python3". 
&gt; so he wants to avoid 3.10, calling it 4.0 instead make it 3.A 
I don't know why this came to mind, but there's a quote somewhere about how effective managers make sure everyone is equally miserable.
A underscore take one extra keystroke per word. camelCase requires one extra keystroke per word.
You could accomplish it with one line instead of the nested loop, using a key like this: assignedLetters.sort(key=alphabet.index)
Click the links? 
[mysqlclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient) is a fork of the most popular Python 2 MySQLdb library that supports Python 3.
I don’t know about your particular Linux distribution, but in MacOS you can create a symbolic link to python3 called “python” and add it to your path ahead of the default system python. Nothing bad happens. Another option is to set up a virtual environment. 
This is actually a deeper problem than it might seem at first glance because you'll have to, in effect, create a parser and lexer for your specification language. Eventually you might find that you want to create a [Domain-specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).
Form a biological perspective, passing the functions around probably won't be necessary because they are specific to the objects. (I am a computational biologist).

When you ask for this sort of advice you should include what your general programming experience is and if there is anything specific you'd like to do with Python. (Or whatever it is you're asking about) Try to anticipate the most obvious questions people may ask to better help you.
Did you mention your affinity for the word `mention`?
They may be specific to those objects but that doesn't mean the API can't be simplified by pulling them out. Imagine that you have a lot of genes that you want to transcribe in a list. You could loop through the list of genes and call gene.transcribe() and store the result in an output list. After the loop completes, the output list will be a list of all of the genes in the input list that have been transcribed. Which is what you want. However, if you pull the transcribe method out, you can achieve the same thing without a for loop. output = map(transcribe, input)
I think greasemonkey could do this.
Will do. Thanks!
you're right. The only reason I wouldn't do what you're proposing is if OP is trying to write this for non programmers. I work with a lot of biologist who are just learning to program now, and sacrificing a little of speed for ease of use for an inexperienced programmer can make a big difference. OP: I also would be down to contribute to an open source project
if you dont provide working instructions that show what this is supposed to do, nobody is going to use it. well, at least i won't. 
Ok. Now we are getting somewhere. Let's break it down into manageable chunks. 
Not really that bad, but the worst I can think of right now: tkinter's failure to keep a reference to images. img = tk.PhotoImage(file='fig.png') lbl = tk.Label(self, image=img) lbl.pack() lbl.any_name_you_want = img # removing this line breaks the code 
Hacking != programming. Python could come in useful, but could also not. Learning some programming language is very benificial and Python is a great choice. If you want to become a hacker on the programming side of things, this sort of hacker being someone who modifies and updates open source programs then Python is amazing as there are a lot of projects built in it. 
This might be true, depending on what OP is really looking for. We will have to wait for more details. That said, their are some useful Python packages for doing this which would make he process easier.
It’s not too difficult to learn other programming languages from python. They are all quite similar. It can be used for hacking, not sure if there are any which are better for it.
I think you would be better served asking an ethical hacking community which languages to learn. Then you would presumably get information about how useful Python is for ethical hacking, as well as tons of other stuff.
 The calculator unpacking videos are the best. 
I would say yes. If you want to learn hacking concepts through Python programming, may I suggest the book Gray Hat Python? I haven't read it personally, but I've read Black Hat Python from the same author and it taught me a lot.
You're right as well. An experienced programmer likely would find my API more enjoyable while an inexperienced programmer may find it confusing. It all depends on what ultimately gets exposed to the end user.
You shouldn’t be doing any of that. You should be using virtualenv 
Theoretically, more noise in certain parts of the ride would indicate the need for repair but I'm sure the amusement park we were going to had much better sensors than the ones from an app on our phone.

im not really sure if this qualifies as a bug because i may just be doing something wrorng, but virtualenvs don't play well with system packages that aren't installed before the env was created to anyone else who knows more than me, is there a way to install a system package and have it detected in the env without manually sym-linking the shared object files and any other necessary data to the env dirs?
It is meant for people who might find it helpful and would know how to modify it for their own purposes. As the source code is just a few lines I really don't find it necessary to document it yet. Thank you for your feedback nevertheless.

So when you say data-driven you really mean 'data-serving'. None of the application seemed to be "driven" by the data, outside of the personal drive to develop it. Doesn't data-driven refer to the data actually changing the form and function of the program? i.e. "data-driven" to me would mean : - you specify the data to be used - the program generates a db table schema to suit the data - the program generates views for the data that sort of thing.
Hasn't. I have asked around a year ago. Anyway, was mainly an excuse to make fun mathematicians. Maybe he did put the code up somewhere but I could not find it. I guess I have to mail him
Oh I didn't know it supported MySQL. Derp. And thanks, subbed!
Wat
&gt; Set True on a frame if it was executed. Coverage would be essentially bytecode level. No source instrumentation was needed. OK, but knowing whether a given frame was instrumented isn't even close to enough information for coverage, so how does this help? 
yeah, this one bit me a few times recently when coding my game that uses a lot of PhotoImages on a canvas. I ended up sticking them all into a list and putting that as an attribute on the tkinter frame object itself...
On Mac OS, homebrew's pypy still has a [crashing bug](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/6949) when run on an OS version before Sierra where it was compiled on. 
Ah man I’d love to meet Matt Parker, such a cool guy and is making math more accessible and fun. 
Cicadas get pretty bad. Really noisy. 
Wow! If this isn’t just hype this will be a great reason to use SQL Server. 
So I just quickly threw this together, but I don't have much experience writing design documents so I'm not sure what I need. An 'if' statement would trigger the creation of an 'operon'. An operon is a sequence of nucleotides consisting of a promoter, a start codon, all desired genes, and a stop codon in this form: [PROMOTER][START][GENES][STOP] The condition following the 'if' denotes the promoter sequence. for example, lets say the promoter sequence for TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_A is ATAGCGA. This: **if (transcription_factor_a){** **...** **}** would be this: **[ATAGCGA][START][GENE][STOP]** In all organisms, the start codon is ATG. There are several stop codons, but we'll use TAG. Start and stop codons are required during translation (RNA -&gt; protein) so the ribosome knows where the code for a single protein begins and ends. The command within the curly parentheses denotes which genes will be transcribed. Let's imagine the gene for PROTEIN_A is TCGAAATGG. This: **if(transcription_factor_A){** **transcribe(protein_A);** **}** would be this: **[ATAGCGA][ATG][TCGAAATGG][TAG]** or **ATAGCGAATGTCGAAATGGTAG** Protein_A could be a transcription factor themselves, creating the potential for incredibly complex networks of gene regulation. a single promoter could be responsible for translating multiple genes as long as there are start and stop codons surrounding each gene. The transcribe function would have to include the names and nucleotide sequence of various proteins and transcription factors.
What did they say? /u/JerMenKoO deleted their comment...
I must've installed it when 3.6 was released then. And i keep forgetting you have to manually update Python. Lol
utilizing ansible at all?
Took me about 20 minutes when I did it. It's a standard ASVAB style association / puzzle-solving test.
You can use `--system-site-packages` with virtualenv. https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#the-system-site-packages-option But that is not a great idea because packages installed in the virtualenv will shadow system packages. System packages that are not shadowed and import shadowed packages will end up importing a different version than they expect. For example package A (in virtualenv) depends on B (in system site) which depends on C. If C is in both, the one in the virtualenvis preferred which could be a different one than C expects (the one in system).
Its not hype you can download sql server 2017 and it has Python support (free for 180 days since its a beta anyways). See https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2017/04/19/python-in-sql-server-2017-enhanced-in-database-machine-learning/
Thanks for the answer, it is working now! Yes, the ``ln`` trickery was first and foremost an act of desperation!
Hacking overalls takes a completely different set of skills.
This isn't correct. It's actually O(n). The problem size (n) is the size of the message - the size of the alphabet is a constant factor, so doesn't increase the complexity. You loop through n elements 26 times, no matter how many letters you have, which is 26n, not n^2. It's implemented fairly inefficiently, but only by constant factors (ie. there's no need to loop through it again for each alphabet letter) - it doesn't affect the complexity from the standard O(n) of bucket sort based approaches.
adding that [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) is a distribution that comes with python a many libraries that let's you create/manage virtual environments so each one can have a separate version of python and dependencies. Also [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is just the command line tool to install/manage stuff in anaconda, you can aalso use this to avoid downloading the whole anaconda. And install what you need on the go. with anaconda you would just use the python you previously configured for each environment leaving your OS default python alone
Thats Numberwang! 
The keywords you should search for are 'cluster computing' and 'high-performance computing' often abbreviated as HPC. One physical machine in a cluster is called a 'node', so I was using 80 computers in racks. 
And also understand how the shebang works. Should `#! /usr/bin/env python3`. See also the now-old PEP 394.
One thing to be careful with python is to look at the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing. Here is a pretty detailed explanation: https://medium.com/practo-engineering/threading-vs-multiprocessing-in-python-7b57f224eadb 
If you're comfortable with IntelliJ, you might want to try using PyCharm, which is a Python IDE built by the same company. There's a free community edition which already has most of the features for working with regular Python code. In general, the open source world (including Python) tends to make a clear distinction between tools to *edit* code and stuff for *running* it. I'm not familiar with ST, but I wouldn't be surprised if picking the language in there just sets the highlighting and so forth. Most tutorials will expect you to run code from the command line. Anaconda is a big collection of Python modules, especially ones relevant for scientific computing, data science and machine learning, which you can install in one go. It also includes the *conda* package manager for installing extra modules and creating environments. If you start `python` in interactive mode, you can see whether it's the Anaconda Python by checking for words like 'Conda' or 'Continuum Analytics' in the banner that it displays.
Very true, VSCode has gotten faster lately.
Thanks again, I'll try and work my way through this code =) 
&gt; for x in alphabet: &gt; for y in assignedLetters: That's fair. I jumped on the "I see two loops" aspect of the algorithm. But you're right; the outer loop as written is of known, constant size. So if the typical message size is significantly longer than 26 characters then I would agree ... the constant is immaterial and it's O(kn) or simply O(n). (And if the message size is shorter than 26 characters then even a "slow" sort is fast.) 👍 But I would add that, as written, the algorithm isn't simply a sort. It's also a filter (removing all characters not in [a-z], including uppercase letters, etc.) Easily fixed, I agree. In practical terms, fixes/enhancements/inclusions would add to the work performed in the outer loop but the big-O complexity would remain the same. But then extending this reasoning, and worth noting ... if this is intended to be a general purpose string sort, then it needs to work with Unicode. And now your outer loop is no longer 26 iterations. At that point, ordinal comparisons (avoided as written) might make sense again. Food for thought.
This has been pulled, and 1.13.3 will be released soon.
This is fucking great. I'm really excited for this, Anaconda owns.
Serious question. Are those all the requirements? Or did y'alls HR department compile a list of random stuff that might be useful? Edit: replaced unclassy word 
Well, this is doing two of those things (specifying the data and generating views), but sure, I can see what you mean. All that is happening here is data comes in and gets displayed, nothing fancy.
I appreciate your help. I didn't provide any details because I just want to know what it/s means; in fact, I don't have any detail to provide, I just tested one small script. Thank you, anyway,
Right, I mean the program would be written in such a way that you could specify a new data set and the database and view would auto-update; not that you hard code the two program steps (steps 2 and 3)
You only need one for loop. for _,time1,_,_,_,time2 in baseList: print(time1-time2) --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Sadly it's python 2.6 on centos 7 (package requirements it's frustrating). If I only use one loop won't it iterate over each top list i.e. baseList[0] baseList[1] etc instead of baseList[0][1] etc?
What? My code should work in 2.6. Show us some example data. 
I feel that I'm getting closer to understanding, but can we break this down a bit more? Let's start with your example. if(transcription_factor_A){ transcribe(protein_A); } Remember, I have only basic understanding of the central dogma of biology. So, could you explain to me what exactly transcription_factor_a is and what protein_a is? Specifically what is a transcription factor? DNA? RNA? Protein? Additionally, I'm confused by the line transcribe(protein_A) since from my understanding transcription is the process of "converting" DNA into RNA and protein is not yet involved at this stage. Maybe I'm just getting confused by the syntax. if (transcription_factor_a){ ... } would be this: [ATAGCGA][START][GENE][STOP] Traditionally, an if statement takes a statement to evaluate and if it is true, then it executes a block of code, otherwise it does not. So I'm not completely following what is meant by saying that the code block above would be [ATAGCGA][START][GENE][STOP]. Since, traditionally the code block would not have any sort of value. Hopefully these questions make sense. 
Microsoft has had R support for a while now in SQL Server and R visualizations in Power BI. Can't wait for this as I enjoy python more. Hopefully python will extend into Power BI as well.
The code they wrote is basically the same as for item in baseList: _, time1, _, _, _, time2 = item print(time1 - time2) which should work for the data structure you described.
I'm cautiously optimistic. My main concern is that MS may be attempting the embrace-extend-extinguish policy it's famous for. It's hard to tell.
I didn't just write a quick brainfuck interpreter in Python, but I did in Nim and Ocaml too. :)
Python is great for getting things working quickly. Nothing says that you don't implement a working project with libraries, then slowly implement the functionality of libraries on your own. Or they give you the ability to make the project much better. 
Dope!
I don't specifically remember, but I'm sure when I was learning to code this must have messed me up for a long while. 
Congrats scipy! 
They absolutely make sense. I appreciate you bearing with me as I'm not great at explaining things like this over text. 1. What is DNA? A: DNA is a molecule consisting of a string of "nucleotides". These nucleotides consist of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine or A, T, G, and C. The sequence these nucleotides are arranged in tells the cell which proteins to make. For our purposes, we can represent a sequence of DNA like this: ATGCGGATC (the letters will be arranged differently depending on the sequence). Every group of 3 nucleotides is called a codon (ATG CGG ATC) 2. RNA? A: RNA is extremely similar to DNA except it's contains ribose instead of deoxyribose (not important) and it contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). In cells, DNA must first be "transcribed" into RNA before it can be "translated" into proteins. 3. Protein? A: A protein is a molecule consisting of a string of amino acids. Each codon on a transcribed strand of RNA codes for one amino acid. 4. Transcription factors? A: Transcription factors are proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA. A transcription factor is specific to its promoter sequence and will not bind to any other sequence. Other proteins then interact with the transcription factor triggering transcription of the gene from DNA to RNA. transcription_factor_a is my name for the sequence of DNA in the promoter region. Maybe it should be promoter_a. It's the sequence of DNA that the transcription factor will bind to. Protein_a is the sequence of DNA that will eventually be translated into the desired protein. Both transcription_factor_a and protein_a refer to sequences of DNA as opposed to an actual protein or transcription factor. I realize that's confusing. You're totally right that that block of code has no value. That was a poor example on my part and I shouldn't have included it. Imagine the '...' is a completed block of code and the [START][GENE][STOP] are actual nucleotides. Or just ignore it completely. Because a promoter binds to a transcription factor before triggering transcription, it's essentially saying "if this transcription factor is present in the cell, then transcribe this gene". 
Ok, now I understand 95%! So the only thing I've yet to understand is what exactly the input/outputs are going to be. Pretend that you and I have already written the code and its working perfectly (yay!). What exactly is our code going to take as an input? I.e. how are we going to know whether a transcription factor is present? What do we need to look at to determine this? And lastly, what is the output? After our code has completed what will we be left with? And thank you for bearing with me as well! This is the challenge of working together across different fields :)
they could well be stuck on 2.5 due to being stuck on an older OS distribution that stopped packaging at 2.5, like RHEL 5 or something.
mysqlclient and pymysql are the two dominant database APIs. one is C-based the other pure Python. they are both maintained by the same person.
In my mind, the purpose of the program is to allow biologists (or anyone with the knowledge to do so) to engineer genomes that functioned a specific way. The inputs would be where transcription_factor_a and protein_a are but they'd be actual names of known molecules. The output would be a string of nucleotides representing the DNA you just coded. for example, HIF1 is a transcription factor that triggers transcription in the absence of oxygen. Luciferase is an enzyme responsible for the light fireflies produce. If we imagine: HIF1 = CGTATACG and Luciferase = AGATCTC and our start and stop codons are ATG and TAG respectively then inputing: if (HIF1){ transcribe(luciferase); } would output: CGTATACGATGAGATCTCTAG The program itself would not check if HIF1, or any transcription factor, was present and it wouldn't transcribe the luciferase. The program I'm imagining is more like an English-to-DNA translator. The resulting DNA sequence, if synthesized and injected into a living organism, would check if HIF1 was present and, if so, transcribe luciferase. Theoretically. 
Fuck, thats pretty cool. I fully understand it now as well. So, to achieve this, we would likely need a domain specific language as was suggested elsewhere in this thread (though it should be pretty simple). We also need a datasource for the transcription factors and proteins and whatnot. Any ideas for this? I'm mildly aware of something called BLAST. Would this fit our needs?
BLAST is exactly what I was thinking of. It's an open source, free catalogue of most known genes across multiple species. It's also a pretty badass statistical analysis tool that you can use to compare the evolutionary distance between specied based on individual genes. Im gonna have to do some research on domain specific language. I haven't even heard that term before.
That would be amazing! I wrote a little more about it in the comments under cephalapod1. Please let me know if it's too vague or if I can explain anything
Great, will do. Here really isn't the best place. If we're interested in trying to prototype, a github repo and the included wiki would be a great place to design the spec.
I'm of the belief that programming is the future of biological sciences. If this became open source and was being contributed to by more biologists, the potential for incredibly complicated functions is huge. I wrote a little more about the idea in the comments under cephalapod1, but there are far more possible instances in genetics. The easier to understand, the better in my opinion. I would really appreciate any insight you had
Which hasn't been a thing since the Balmer era. Microsoft of old is dead. Microsoft today is embracing and extending but not extinguishing
Yeah thanks, just learned about this today. My university has resources that I can use, but they limit each user at 30 nodes.
I will, thanks.
trace 7-g
You should take a data structures and algorithms course. I have a feeling you would like it, and you would learn a lot.
So I've done some modeling of genetic circuits like this before, my main question why you are output sequences? For example when I have done modeling like this before I have done transcribe(luciferase_gene) -&gt; luciferase_mRNA then translate(luciferase_mRNA) -&gt; luciferase_protein because it really seems like you are trying to keep track of what molecules you have, which is irrelevant to the sequences of the molecules. Additionally, if you want to look for Transcription factor binding regions (usually called motifs) you should check out the ENCODE project
Normally I would agree with you. But for a small API like that it's kind of obvious how to use it. I could easily deduct all the stuff I needed within minutes. Cheers, Chris
Okay please tell me in plain English, preferably in words of one syllable or less, why a csv module is needed in Python just to process a text file. In fact as .py files are also text files can we also process them with the csv module? How about .ini files? Why not cut and paste every comment ever made on reddit into a text file and process that with the csv module, it's just text, and according to you they are all completely interchangable?
Me too. I picked up the Kindle version of Python Crash Course last night. A little boring at the moment since I already have some programming experience, but I'm looking forward to the projects in the second half of the book, and it's helping me get used to the syntax since my prior experience is Java and BASIC.
&gt; First, you're complaining as someone who didn't even ask the original question. Irrelevant to the point being made. &gt; I took the time to write something up as an example ... As a matter of personal preference So you write up a poor example as your code is not Pythonic, you prefer your way of doings things, as in using `__new__` rather than `__init__` and a silly `classmethod` rather than a straight forward `__init__` with half a dozen arguments. Great :-(
Good grief, did it take a PhD in mathematics to work that one out?
The bastard that you can't track down as it starts miles away from where you actually see the problem.
Yeah, I have read a book on using it for constructing phylogenetic trees. Anyways, I think we can start small. Just define the syntax of our language and run our code on some test input. Once we get that working we can worry about getting it hooked up to the backend (like BLAST). Edit: Shall I create a github repo or would you like to?
You're not upgrading to Python 3 until Python 4 is out. Playing it safe I see.
Thanks! I'll definitely check it out. I'm not a biologist or anything so I really appreciate any advice. I'm not sure I totally understand what you mean, but I'm interested in the DNA sequence as the final output. I'm interested in keeping track of the molecules to the extent that I need to have a library, or something, containing the names and sequences that code for the molecules. 
If it did it might explain why you didn't figure it out yourself. Unless you were joking, in which case you need some practice.

This is awesome. I don't know if there is anything like what you're proposing, but I'm fully on board to make it a thing.
I made one, wanna pm me youre username?
I made a repository on GitHub. Pm me your username and I'll make you a collaborator 
Done
You should drop by our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/AlphaHooks/Lobby?source=orgpage) to discuss where you want to help. 
The program doesn't have a standard library yet. This gives you the most creative freedom and is easier compared to the core GUI stuff. Hit our gitter room if you want to contribute :)
thats the problem i was referring to
We need a better place to further discuss this other than Reddit. I propose using Discord. If its ok with you I will go ahead and create a server.
Sounds great! Thanks
Great, if you and /u/Konchshell pm me your usernames I will invite you.
I live and die by IPython. One of the best tools for learning python or just testing stuff out while coding. Easily installed via pip or your system's package manager (assuming you're on linux or something like it).
Soon the only jobs in machine learning will be developing software suites for people who have no idea what they're doing. 
Well you clearly missed my previous smiley so I couldn't be bothered with another one.

Many times you don't need every function of the library, in that cases try to build that on your own. So as to decrease the number of libraries used. Make your judging panel believe that you built that thing and worked hard on that code. You'll surely get higher marks. All the best.

I would suggest picking something realistic. What projects have you worked on in the past? Where is an area you may not know much about but are interested in learning. Be honest in considering your abilities and do what you can to avoid over extending yourself . Try and avoid using any dependencies besides any basic ones you might need, like MySQL connector if you want a db, os, sys, reg, etc, etc. The more you build yourself, the better developer you'll be, don't hide from some of the gory details that make it all work. 
I'm getting ready for 3.7. Isn't life just wonderful when your health is crap so you just code at home for fun :-)
So what's the story, no axe to grind, just curious?
The LWN article series on the “gilectomy” indicating the main problem areas are: reduced performance (from fine grained lock contention IIRC); third party extension modules, which often implicitly rely on the GIL behaving in certain ways; and complications with garbage collection of cyclic references. Apart from that - which is not trivial - things basically work in the GIL-free CPython branch. 
async def lets the parser and syntax checkers know that “await” and “async for” may be used in the function body.
&gt; Black Hat Python Interesting book. Seems to cover a lot of interesting topics.
How about performance? It should somewhere near running your code locally with python installed right? This would be a reason to use Inno Setup instead PyInstaller because startup time of a PyInstaller exe is way too long for small apps. 
Sure, I'll do that.

1. Embrace. 2. Extend. &lt; You are here. 3. Extinguish. Give it 3 years.
It has the potential to do certain pandas &lt;-&gt; SQL operations much faster, but the cost of SQL Server is always the problem. That said, the more python love from Microsoft the better. 
Our current setup is Python 3.4, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy + PyMySQL... your DB team is wrong.
Things like number crunching and machine learning. Cause, AFAIK, the easiest language to use to do these things is Python.
Anaconda's logo looks like a 'page loading' symbol. Because of the way it formatted on my phone screen I waited 5 minutes for that article to load. 
Microsoft of today simply doesn't have the muscle to extinguish. Which is why it's trying to build a viable business model on the embrace-extend part of the cycle.
There are so, so many reasons not to follow that link.
Can't wait! 
okay, i see execution time and count, so that gives me a rough idea, what it does. but why use that instead of eg [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#instant-user-s-manual)? is there a difference to what a profiler does? a hint, that this relies on [time.perfcounter and process_time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter), which is only available in &gt;=3.3, would also be interesting for any potential user. if there were a setup.py that defines requirements and has a short description, i would not have a problem with the "read code" argument and agree with it, but there is some basic information, that is important. if op, does not want to spend time to sum up the features and aspects of their work, that's fine, keep it to yourself, but why post on reddit then? i am assuming it's so that others use their work, but with that come more requirements, than code.
Ah, interesting - so it's not that easy. Rather unfortunate. I've found a solution for my issue though - by the looks of it there was a "max try" value for the password change application. I was able to trigger that by sending another \n with the input stream. This allowed me to then interprete the output the server was writing back to me on stderr. Definitly not the prettiest of solutions but it works - since i don't have to much time i can spend on working out a nicer one this will. Especially since it's not really for any sort of customer app, just more of an internal tool.
That's great. The problem is that I use another distro (Raspbian and Ubuntu), so that way is not possible. Anyway I will use a virtual environment. 
Would you be able to give some context ? In general - setting is (at its very basic level) storing a value at a known location. A mapping is another name of an associative array. A 'normal' array (or a list in Python), is index by an integer - i.e. the value is stored at a known position in the list. In an associative array the value that you store is associate with another value which is normally termed the 'key'. That key could be anything you want. A good analogy is a phone book - it would be useless if you couldn't look up people's name and addresses by someone's name; a mapping would let you store someone phone number against someones name. In Python the simplest mapping is a dictionary - and Python does literally use them everywhere. A quick example: &gt;&gt;&gt; phones = dict( ) &gt;&gt;&gt; phones['Michael Palin'] = '0775 555 233' &gt;&gt;&gt; phones['John Cleese'] = '0993 555 8867' &gt;&gt;&gt; print(phones['Michael Palin']) 0775 555 233 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(phones['Terry Jones']) KeyError: 'Terry Jones' &gt;&gt;&gt; print(phones.get('Terry Jones','unknown name')) Unknown name Notice the use of the 'get' method in the last line to provide a nice default value (rather than that ugly KeyError). In python you can use a variety of values as the key for a dictionary - simple examples include strings, numbers &amp; tuples 
Depends on the context. Normally speaking, "setting" means to assign a value to a variable or some spot in a data structure. E.g., `a = 23` is a statement that *sets* the variable `a` to the value `23`; `foo['bar'] = "blah"` *sets* the key `bar` in the `foo` dictionary to `"blah"`. Mapping, in the most general sense, means to apply a one-way transform to some values. For example, you can map numbers to positions on a map: each number corresponds to a map position. The mapping does not have to be reversible: there may be map positions that no number maps to, or map positions that multiple numbers map to. But every valid input should be mapped to exactly one output. In Python, mappings can be represented as *functions* (where the value to map is presented as a function argument, and the value it maps to is the return value), *lambda expressions* (basically functions, too), *dictionaries* (where dictionary keys are values to map, and the values mapped to are dictionary values), or *objects* (where the value to map is a property name, and the value mapped to is the value of that property). More specifically, in a functional-programming context, "mapping" refers to applying the `map` function. `map` takes as arguments a mapping (expressed as a function), and a collection to "map over"; it traverses the collection, applies the mapping to each element, and returns a new data structure that has the same shape as the original collection, but replaces every element with the thing the mapping evaluated to. You could, for example, write a function that removes all vowels from a string, called `remove_vowels`, and then you could call `map(remove_vowels, ["hello", "world"])`, which would return `["hll", "wrld"]`. It's worth noting that there is also a function `set()` in Python, but unlike `map()`, it doesn't perform any mapping or setting, but instead, it constructs a `set` data structure, that is, an unordered collection where elements are unique (that is, adding elements that are already in the set does nothing, and the order in which you add elements doesn't matter). Sets are used a lot in Python; a common use case is de-duplicating lists, which is simply a matter of converting to a set and then (if needed) back to a list. With a bit of squinting, you might call an application of `set()` "setting", although I have never seen the word used that way.
I am not sure why I didn't realise that the # might be a comment - do. I was thrown by the lack of code formatting. Can you confirm that the code that gives you the error is this : arr = [ [[35,23,14],[2,43,22]], [[1,0,33],[11,13,25]], [[100,6,90],[21,9,91]], [[18,29,68],[14,91,41]] ] def add(arr): b = arr[2][0] b[1] = 96 a = arr[0][1][2] a = a % len(arr) b[1] = b[1] - arr[0][1][2] return b I have just tried it and that code works fine for me.
My company's on 2.7 too, we have hugely complex websites relying on Pylons among other stuff. I'm fairly certain that's at least two dependencies that never went beyond 2.7.
I would say it's a good shot, but I see two problems: * yet another validation implementation/language, with its subtilities and gotcha. You could have used an existing library like marshmallow or cerberus or whatever. It would also save you lots of work. * One of the ugly things about using json is managing encoder for custom types. I would have appreciated a better way to add encoding functions for specific types. On the other hand, error handling seem to be handy! Thank you for sharing.
Wait, scipy has been considered incomplete/beta all these years? I have never encountered any missing/broken functionality.

Anaconda sucks, use universal wheels
So I'm looking at this cerberus and it looks great. Would you reckon I build this into my existing library? Perhaps something as: ``` @app.route('/'); @endpoint.api( cerberus={...cerberus schema here...} ) ``` Any thoughts on how to best expose cerberus in combination with my already existing `endpoint.api` decorator?
That's cool. These are exactly the type of projects that teaches you a wide variety of technologies, in this case: a search back-end, a nice front-end and web crawling. Quite valuable information to learn and fun to play around with.
I've never done any streaming of audio data but it sounds like all you really need is PyAudio which is a Python binding of PortAudio. The library handles all the audio input and output via microphones and headphones. I've even gotten PortAudio working with cobbled together microphones so it should probably work with whatever you have. It's probably not very efficient to send the raw audio data through in real time however so you might want to find some way to compress the audio data. Probably a fft of some kind, numpy has a pretty good one.

what do you mean by 2d? if you are doing visual novels, RenPy is basically the best for that. if you mean arcade action then sure, use unity.
Yes, but I read about that symlink or using update-alternatives is not a good practice. I think I will switch to virtualenv. Thanks 
Sorry for nitpicking, but I dislike `dict()`. Dict literals exist. It's like calling `int()` instead of writing `0`.
Anaconda is the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel. In fact it's so great that I'm a little worried. Have I grown dependent on proprietary software to do open-source work?
If you open a file with a .py extension the syntax highlighting will be active. The difference between sublime and an IDE is that you (unless you find some plugin) have to run the python script from a terminal.
If you're just starting, get the community edition. It's open source, free, and just as good. However Notepad++ is perfectly fine. People just seem to REALLY like PyCharm (I've never got it myself, I use Geany (like N++) and the basic IDLE).
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html As beginner you good with the community version. In my opinion the professional is only worth it if you work with the supported frameworks quite often - but it's really not necessary.
Hello I found working command : from subprocess import call call ([ "Path to tor &amp; start-tor-browser file ", "website" ])
FYI you could have a massive security hole in your application by formatting strings from outside sources directly into SQL statements, i.e. sql injection. ` query = """INSERT INTO {} (stock_name, high_val52wk, low_val52wk) VALUES(\'{}\', {}, {});""".format(table, stock, high_price, low_price) cur.execute(delete_query) cur.execute(query) self.conn.commit() ` should be: ` query = """INSERT INTO {} (stock_name, high_val52wk, low_val52wk) VALUES(%s, %s, %s);""".format(table) cur.execute(delete_query) cur.execute(query, (stock, high_price, low_price)) self.conn.commit() ` i.e. like this: https://github.com/portfoliome/postpy/blob/master/postpy/dml.py
The magic words for this (that will reveal the appropriate documents from computer science) are "formal grammar". Once you have defined that grammar, there are some nice talks by Beazley or Gaynor from Pycon about how to write an interpreter for a given grammar.
I would recommend you stick with the text editor. PyCharm is great, but all of its features are geared toward improving productivity. Right now you don't need productivity, you need to learn. As a beginner I used PyCharm and I found that the autocomplete and other features became a crutch for my bad code.
The company I work for already pays for SQL Server for our ERP system. No I just have to wait 15-20 years until we upgrade to the 2017 version. 
If you need a remote debugging or remote deployment you don't have it in community version. Also in community version you don't have support for databases. If you don't need that I suggest you to go for community version. Happy coding! :)
You lucky dog you!
Win still runs the vast majority of laptops/desktops and is widely used in large organizations/public entities. They still have muscle.
&gt; Also in community version you don't have support for databases. To clarify, you can write code against databases just fine in the CE. The PE adds fully integrated database inspection/debugging tools.

just to clarify when I said distribution I meant a python distribution. it's cross platform and runs on the raspberry pi [https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh) but maybe it's not the best solution in a py unless you are sparing disk space or using external hdd 
I want those big sheets of paper they always use.
Yes! I also would like to write everything on those, with Sharpies, but my handwriting is terrible...
you do have a point - although I dislike using the empty dictionary literal as it can get lost. Also, more often than not I am using a defaultdict, so using dict() (over {} ) feels more natural to me.
This is how I think of it. Which is more human readable? url = f'{url_base}/{self.id}/{self.session_id}-{self.search_term}' url = '{}/{}/{}-{}'.format( url_base, self.id, self.session_id, self.search_term ) I've been teaching a couple non-dev coworkers how to use Python, and I encourage them to use f strings because readability matters. Plus, it forces us to at least use 3.6, which I consider a huge benefit.
That's everything... We're more interested in your OO reasoning skills and abilities than what language you've been working in, as we are in the midst of a transition and refactor. We're looking for adaptable, quick learners.
Strong second for PyCharm - and this is from an old time emacs user. Great integration of editing, debugging, and interactive (REPL) development.
thank you! And yeah I'll keep that in mind when I ask similar questions.
I don't know. I suspect a bug was found that needed an immediate fix.
True. Remember, kids, always sanitize your inputs
...spam spam spam spam spam...
It has nothing to do with being easy to adapt, it has to do that I expect I can just copy your code and reproduce. If I can't reproduce the example, it means I have to look into the source code and perhaps stuff just doesn't work at all. It's not very inviting. I can understand you don't want to document it yet, but if you do, I'd expect it to work, that's all.
I really agree with this.
Consider implementing a Lisp, Scheme or Forth.
Even though I'm on python3, I still tend to write literals with an explicit `.` for division when I want floating point: e.x.: `1 / 3.`
(( 0_o )) / 
No. I don't want my the non-MKL version of numpy that is 10x slower.

Yes that is bad news
Couldn't you use PyInstaller but not bundle everything into a single exe? Then, it should be no different than just running your app with an installed Python interpreter, right?
This is great... just getting into programming... thanks for the explanation... pretty sure I at least get the gist :)

Honestly, neither are that readable. That's why I haven't switched. Also, we're not using 3.6 yet in prod, so...
To be honest, I prefer Marshmallow as I find it cleaner and more Pythonic, but cerberus is great nonetheless. I would probably expose it as a `schema` keyword argument, to hide unnecessary information (which library is used beneath the hood?).
There obviously is no best gui library, otherwise everyone would use it and it would only be one. There is only "best for" ... which means you need to tell us what you want from a GUI library before we can tell you what's best for you. in a nutshell: * Tkinter: best for super fast development and if you don't want to require your windows users to install extra libraries * pyGTK / PyGObject: best for native looking gnome / linux programs. Uses Glade. * PyQT/ PySide: best for highly custom very pretty interfaces and automatic event linking. Looks native on any OS. You can use QTDesigner to create GUIs. * wxPython: Alternative to tkinter for fast and easy interfaces. Has a GTK-like Glade. Recently available for python3! * Kivy: best for multi-touch and small screens - tablets and phones. * Remi: best for programs that can be accessed via a browser locally or remotely * Bokah: best for interactive data display in a browser. You may also want to ask yourself if your project would be better as a web app, and use python libraries like django or flask to build that. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin.

https://github.com/realpython/flask-paywall is a starter project that I worked on that should get you started with some of the logic you are looking to implement. It uses server-side templating and jQuery. If you are planning on tying the register and payment form together, you can follow this workflow: 1. Client registers and pays 1. On success from Stripe, update the user model 1. Assuming there is a `paid` boolean field on the model, you can display premium content if that field is true

For the 3rd or fourth time in my life i have tried to start learning python, but as always i am on the verge of giving up trying to figure out how to import a module. =Z Why isn't there an easier way to do this? I write code and i want to execute it. I don't want to run to 5 different places trying to change variables to paths that i don't understand and second guessing myself as to if i installed python to the right place or typed the path name wrong, or who knows wtf i did wrong. /rant Edit: nvm, i also hate hate hate how windows no longer has a "My Computer" button. Damn them to hell lol

Have you read the doc page? You can specify topdown = True when calling. That allow you to modify the dirlist before any are read. So each time you get a new dirpath, prune the unwanted directories from the dirlist. (On phone, so sorry for typos)
`\` escapes special characters and here copyRegex = re.compile(r'S:\\ACCM\\14 Copies\\.*', re.I) you're escaping path separators within a raw string which would generate S:\\\\ACCM\\\\14 Copies\\\\.* Perhaps you meant this? copyRegex = re.compile(r'S:\ACCM\14 Copies\.*', re.I)
First off, / isn't the escape character, \ is ... your solution with Windows is to either use posix-style paths (ie "c:/path/to/file.txt") which are perfectly valid even if that's not well known, or manually escape all the slashes ("c:\\path\\to\\file.txt") or better yet use *raw strings* to represent all your paths (r"c:\path\to\file.txt"). These last two are basically the same options with **re** patterns; typically your best answer is to use *raw strings* for any pattern that includes literal backslashes. However none of that is the best way to skip directories in an **os.walk**: for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path): dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d != "ignoreme"] for f in files: print(os.path.join(root, f)) This way you'll simply never descend into the directories that are filtered out of **dirs**.
that makes you a skilled wrapist

I love when articles have a tl;dr at the top, its like abstracts with technical papers. I just wanna know if I should read the rest!

I would start with AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON. He has an online book. Plus, if u go with Black Hat Python and dont have an understanding of basic networking, or basic python syntax for that matter, you may have a hard time. Those books are a bit advanced if youve never programmed before. What is your coding background?

Ah, yeah. Windows in my opinion is awful for python development, and although sometimes I do it, it is much more usable in a Linux boot or a VM.
// in Python is a "floor division" operator. That means that the result of such division is the floor of the result of regular division (performed with / operator). The floor of the given number is the biggest integer smaller than the this number. For example 7 / 2 = 3.5 so 7 // 2 = floor of 3.5 = 3. For negative numbers it is less intuitive: -7 / 2 = -3.5, so -7 // 2 = floor of -3.5 = -4. Similarly -1 // 10 = floor of -0.1 = -1.
Because that division gives you the quotient. 1=0*10+1 -1= -1*10+9
In Python 2: `3/2=1` In Python 3: `3/2=1.5` and // operator was added to get the integer division. In [PEP-238](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/) it is explained that // operator is the same as floor function meaning you get the lowest integer. You can also check [r/LearnPython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) [edit: format]
`//` is defined to do the same thing as `math.floor()`: return the largest integer value less than or equal to the floating-point result. Zero is not less than or equal to -0.1. I can see why you would sometimes want "round negative toward zero", but "round toward -∞" is more often useful when you're doing further calculations on the result.
I thinking you can call data between spreadsheets the same way you can pull data between pages. I'm not sure on the details but if that's an option it might be easier. 
`//` does floor division, so it's always rounding down. If you place the result on a number line, it will always move toward the integer on the left: 0.1 | -1 --------- 0 --------- 1 &lt;-- -0.1 | -1 --------- 0 --------- 1 &lt;---------
You made me wonder about why it is implemented this way, and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14348219/integer-division-modulo-operation-with-negative-operands-in-python makes it more clear! But it's obvious that either the modulo or the integer division must be negative here.
There are many kinds of integer division operations, and correspondingly, modulo operations. Python has the "floored" variant. You seem to be expecting the more common "truncated" division. See this article for a detailed explanation of why the "floored" variant is often more useful in practice than the "truncated" variant: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
**Modulo operation** In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus). Given two positive numbers, a (the dividend) and n (the divisor), a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n. For example, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3. (Note that doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation; the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction.) Although typically performed with a and n both being integers, many computing systems allow other types of numeric operands. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

How is your Git hosted? I know that Bitbucket (Atlassian) has a plugin to support .ipynb diffs, Github seems to handle them fine as well. Ideally though you should only be using notebooks for exploratory analysis, then pulling refined production code out into scripts to be executed by something like Airflow or Luigi. As for IDEs go (when I'm refactoring notebook code into modules) I really like VSCode, it has deploy over SSH and fantastic Git integration out of the box.
This makes sense! I wouldn't have thought int(-0.1) = -1 but now that I think about it, it should.
You can use Numpy to do this. numpy has a lot of tools you can use. Basically what it is doing here is setting your array to by the same as a float for every nth col by nth row. If that makes sense import xlrd import xlwt import numpy as np def read_excel(filename, n=0): contentstring = open(filename, 'rb').read() book = xlrd.open_workbook(file_contents=contentstring) sheet = book.sheets()[n] array = np.zeros((sheet.ncols, sheet.nrows)) for row in range(sheet.nrows): for col in range(sheet.ncols): array[col][row] = sheet.cell(row, col).value return array 
I'm digging through the code and a lot of this is where I get lost in Python. Are there any tutorials or open course material (like MIT's etc) available for this type of thing?
The company I work for still have a system built on Karl and python 2.3... 
Don't do string manipulation on a path. It's not portable. It's verbose. It's not direct. It's not the right level of abstraction. Use the proper `os.path` functions, or the newer `pathlib.Path`, and work with the `components` property. Maybe see if `components[some:slice] == ('spam', 'eggs', …).
1. Learn about codecs and containers. 2. Learn about network protocols, specifically, why people use RTP or similar, and why over UDP. 3. Find a library that will encode things over your protocol of choice, in the container format of choice (depends who's receiving—browser? welcome to portability headaches), and choose an appropriate codec. For quick and dirty, I just used Python to set up RTP using `ffmpeg`… now assuming there were no NAT issues in this design: - [SimpleVoIP](https://github.com/pilona/SimpleVoIP) - [`rtp.sh`](https://github.com/pilona/Utils/blob/master/rtp)

There are several interesting projects you could build relatively easily in python. Unless you want to actually develop Python (the language, its modules etc) just pick something interesting for you and do it in python. There are several projects you can check the sticky of this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/72kl2a/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/) for countless ideas and demos from other devs. Also check [r/LearnPython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) If you want a quick idea from the top of my head, check async.

If python 2 compat matters, use the comment alternative syntax for type hints
I've heard talk that this guy is an excellent analyst as well. A true analwrapist.
These types of questions usually do better on /r/learnpython. But you should read up on loops and functions.
Specific to cffi, their documentation is quite good. Probably what is no that clear is how the extension is actually compiled. In this particular case, it is directly embedded, so that there is no need to have the library on the system. This is not always an option, either because you do not control the library or because of licensing.
SSL cert is bad
Honestly, I think you’ll find Sublime Text or VS Code a nice middle ground between a text editor and PyCharm. There’s a lot of really useful functionality in PyCharm, but it feels heavy and complicated for a lot of what I use it for. Unless you need to do a lot of refactoring of a medium/large codebase I would try the editors I mentioned above.
Why would we not do it ourselves? Why would we trust an obfuscated executable? Why would source code be shared with you? Why connect a github account to it.... 
It's meant to be a quick way to convert a file without downloading and installing anything extra.
SSL issue should be fixed shortly.
If you want to go back, like replaying a piece of your code you should read up on loops [(while loop)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_while_loop.htm). 
I'm hoping that following his advice will lead to a nu start.
&gt; Ideally though you should only be using notebooks for exploratory analysis, then pulling refined production code out into scripts to be executed by something like Airflow or Luigi. I am only using notebooks for exploratory analysis and writing .py modules as I create useful and interchangeable functions. These are the base for future use in production. Frankly, I'm pretty new to the field, so can you explain what Airflow does? There are so many open source project that give vague descriptions that I'm not informed enough to understand. Also, VSCode looks great, thank you!
Yes. You're right, but the django rest framework expects a dictionary for serializing. At least that's how I've always worked with it. 
Ol Reddit hug of death? Site is down. 
Here's another tool: https://github.com/nvbn/py-backwards
That's a much more complicated tool than this one. This one just turns the parts of type hints which do not affect runtime into whitespace, trying to preserve line and column numbers so error messages correspond.
In that case, you should be able to write a wrapper function that would handle that, since it can be replaced with `e` in all cases. (Python only uses one float size) eg: real_float = float def float(a): if type(a) == str: return real_float(a.replace('d','e') return real_float(a) This should always work, as far as I can tell. You can't feed float() hex strings, so that shouldn't be an issue.
Given that it's EOL, I'd suggest repackaging it yourself. Redhat won't help you either way.
Very funny, like you don't make a bad mistake every once in a while. If someone believes in God, their just as "drug addled", which is proof that people can make very bad mistakes. (I'm not saying that God doesn't exist, just that most people are not justified in believing in God. Maybe they're justified in believing that God's existence is likely.)
When you have had the rug pulled under you a dozen times you start seeing a pattern. 
erm ... int(-0.1) is not -1 (at least not in python 3.5) math.floor(-0.1) = -1, however, which is what // does.
int(-0.1) == 0 math.floor(-0.1) == -1
Your post literally screams cloud 9. It's all stored remotely, every project is its own ubuntu virtual machine, and it has a built in bash terminal.
It's not an issue of how to parse it (that does miss the `1.23D+5` case as well as unicode), it's the fact that it worked and they removed functionality. It's not in the explicit change log, but it's kind of an edge case. Presumably, if you write a code that supports Python 2.7.13, it should still work on Python 2.7.0. It very well may not (I know of one case where it doesn't).
As /u/desmoulinmichel says, if you want compatibility, the simplest thing to do would likely be to use the comment-based syntax: http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python2.html An interesting extension would be to modify the tool so it takes Python 3-style annotations and converts them into the comment syntax.
I believe Eclipse Che (https://www.eclipse.org/che/) can do what you want -- note that although it's on Eclipse.org and the name is similar to the Eclipse IDE, it doesn't really have much in common with the Eclipse IDE (they're completely different products).
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2017-September/077228.html .3 is the same source as .2, but with a number of packaging and build problems fixed. It looks like there's a bug in the interaction between Cython 0.27 and CPython 3.5, and this cascaded through and broke a lot of unpinned dependencies. .3 has been rebuilt and the wheels should now work.
Would you mind trying PyInstaller instead of cx_Freeze? The new version of PyInstaller now supports Python 3.6. I have had good success with this. Another option is Nuitka, but I have little experience with it; however, it also supports 3.6 * http://www.pyinstaller.org/ * http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html 
I used cffi a bunch at my job and it was pretty straight forward. Seconding that the docs are really good (just read them carefully). 
my own solution: need to recompile vim with python2
I considered such an extension, but it would change the line numbering and make errors harder to trace in the original file. I think it would be easier to dump out a stub file. The annotated file itself might work as a stub file, but I haven't looked into it much.
The invariant is that x // y * y + x%y is x. C and python do it differently.
Looks like it's just rounding down. .1 is rounded down to 0. -.1 is less than 0 and is rounded down to -1. I'm not sure what real world case you'd use a floor with negative values. 
I guess I was thinking once you've converted the code over, you'd abandon the Python-3 only version and develop on the Python-2 + Python-3 compatible codebase. It seems a little less fragile that way?
Can you post your setup file?
It would be less fragile, but in that case you should probably just use comment typing in the first place. I much prefer the Python 3 style of syntax over typing in comments. I'll probably drop Python 2 support at some point.
Okay, well now you don't have any A records in your DNS config so the domain name isn't pointing to your server at all.
He doesn't have any A records in his DNS config. Guess he must have messed something up while trying to fix that ssl issue...
does Python have a ceiling variant to this as an operator?
ah we still have some rhel5 long term support products kicking around (I work for RH). but sure.
Nope, but you can just add 1 to the result of the floor operator.
That doesn't seem like it'd work for numbers that divide evenly
Then just do the ceil on normal division.
Fair enough.
I professionally use the community version with sqlalchemy, what exactly would sqlalchemy support offer. I also use docker, my understanding that is that you can use a dock env with the debugger, that's nifty.
I've been doing more work on [KCK](https://gitlab.com/frameworklabs/kck). But specifically, I've started to work in a [couple of decorators](https://gitlab.com/frameworklabs/kck/blob/decorators/tests/test_decorators.py#L119) that make integrating just the cache with more typical python code in Django or Flask or something a lot easier. I showed off the decorators at work today and, as it happens, everyone on the team is morally opposed to caching (that's a thing?), so they didn't much dig it, but I'm unmoved by their arguments (and I love a good challenge, so it's all good, man) and I still think they're neato, so have a look! I'd love comments!
&gt;other cases add another .replace, of course. Are there unicode characters this would cause problems with? I guess if you pass in a unicode string you could cast it to an ascii string. It's being passed to float() after all, which has a pretty restrictive set of rules on what will or will not raise a ValueError. Even an empty string raises ValueError.
Where?
f-strings are also the most performant way to concatenate strings and variables.
But what if they don't divide evenly Maybe just use numpy.floor :p
It's cool but I wouldn't recommend anyone put a significant amount of money into one of these trading sites. They are constantly hacked and the cryptocurrency disappears. Plus companies can just claim they were hacked and hide the coins they stole and slowly launder them back to themselves.
I gave up once I discovered pyinstaller. I had a compiled, single file executable in less time than it took to install cx_Freeze and discover it wasn't capable of creating such a thing. It handles module inclusion much more sanely, too. The executable I created with pyinstaller was less than half the size of my cx_Freeze distribution. Oh, and did I mention it was a single file executable? Because it's a single fucking file exe that I can drop anywhere I damn well please.
No clue what you're talking about. Hopefully you can give python clearer instructions than this.
Well you could do it potentially with the sockets library, but it would be a ton of work.
Pretty cool... I don't think I've ever gone the `conda` route for my apps-- I may consider this in the future. I've usually just compiled the exe via `pyinstaller`and then `inno setup` to place the exe/configs/files/folders/etc. to wherever I want on a system. What I'd love to see (this doesn't have to come from you, but someone in the Python community) is an auto/prompt updating application framework. I've checked out a couple of ways/ideas: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6932389/how-to-remotely-update-python-applications https://fernandofreitasalves.com/how-to-create-an-application-with-auto-update-using-python-and-esky/ https://theupdateframework.github.io/ https://github.com/JMSwag/PyUpdater https://www.pyupdater.org/ I've tried several ways-- nothing really worked in the end. I wish it was as simple as some of the write-ups make it sound or perhaps just "cut-and-paste this code" but I'm still stumbling.
Yep, I learnt a lot of this over the last year or so. I ended up going for RPMs with bdist_rpm. Works pretty well actually. It would be nice if things like PyPI had a better ecosystem. For example, if there was a PyPI server that you could run locally, and to mirror packages with some sort of whitelisting, that would be amazing. (I know there are some libraries for this, but they are an absolute pain in the ass to install). That would then encourage me to upload my packages to PyPI instead of simply keeping them to myself and my organization in an RPM repository.
Why do you still care about legacy python 2?

Async became a keyword. 
Another option is you can just use pandas and just http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/generated/pandas.read_excel.html This will take the file as-is, be in a dataframe (aka column format). At that point, data manipulation is relatively straight forward.
Do you need to do this in Python? Otherwise, you can just do this in bash ... find . -name "*.txt*" pipe it to a mv/cp and you're done? 
You can add 0.5 before rounding. Its a trick I used in Fortran, since it didn't implement ceiling.
I use grequests. https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests
`int` is round towards 0.
Which works as long as statistical rounding isn't used/needed.
You are right.
Have you tried `-1 \\ 10`? /s
I'm very very certain you need counciling - either for your drug addiction or your complete lack of coherent replies and nonsensical behaviour. Chill and think about what you're trying to say. Spouting random unrelated bull is going to get you nowhere.
I learned using Sublime but now that I'm working on several large codebases with many different Django applications and moving parts, I use PyCharms professional. There's not too much of a difference between CE and Professional unless you need to be able to remotely deploy to a server or debug. CE has built-in VCS integration (E.g Mercurial or Git) but lacks SFTP which is a huge timesaver to have PyCharms automatically upload to a dev.server if you aren't running locally. Other than that and some plugins, not too different. For free, CE is certainly a very capable IDE. If you are a student/have an .edu e-mail address, you can get PyCharms professional for free.

Oh well okay then I'll give a try to Pyinstaller. Anyways, thanks man.
The resulting dict_keys object is a view into the keys - you can't modify it. If you look again at their code they are modifying the original dictionary they called .keys() on, which then the view reflects. e: typo
Because it's quick, with almost no overhead. The hashing approach in this PEP is going to be great for creating consistent .pycs, but will be a relatively (compared to just using a timestamp) slow and heavy process. The idea of using timestamps by default and an option to switching to hashes sounds ideal to me.
The `dict_keys` is immutable. In my example code, I’m modifying the original dictionary and demonstrating the reflected change in the `dict_keys` view. In your example, you are trying to use `keys` as if it were a dictionary when it isn’t.
Right. Sorry about that. Misread your code example.
&gt; No I just have to wait 15-20 years until we upgrade to the 2017 version. optimistic, aren't you?
&gt; For example, if there was a PyPI server that you could run locally, and to mirror packages with some sort of whitelisting, that would be amazing. (I know there are some libraries for this, but they are an absolute pain in the ass to install). You want [devpi](https://devpi.net/docs/devpi/devpi/stable/%2Bd/index.html). I use it on my laptop as a PyPI mirror/proxy. Installing is a one-liner with `pip`, configuration is easy, supports multiple per-user or global indexes, mirroring of multiple upstream indexes, whitelisting, everything you ask for.
I can upload it to google drive for you? Because it works for me

What you are really saying is you have a product where you want others to test for you for free, no thanks!
&gt; Python’s syntax for dictionaries inspired the syntax of the JSON serialization format. I didn’t know this. 
No it didn't. It was entirely discovered inside JavaScript
[citation needed]
Is it that so bad? I mean you get access to a new tool and test it and we get feedback. Bad deal?
Sort of. Here’s a great talk[0] by Douglas Crockford about the history of JSON. About 23:00 in, he talks about how the inventors of JS, Python, and NewtonScript used the same notation for nested objects, all in isolation from each other. Given how important and universal JSON has become, it reminds me of the rise of calculus in some ways. Pretty cool. [0] https://youtu.be/-C-JoyNuQJs
I think what you've done here is useful. Could use some tweaks. I've taught introductory Python to hundreds of engineers, and there's nothing I'm more excited about teaching and nothing they're more confused about learning than dictionaries and mapping types in general. I've been working on my approach for years to find the right language and examples to have the topic make sense quickly 
Excellent article.
Yes it is because essentially you want others to do free testing for something others get paid to do. No thanks!
And another thing, I looked at your post history you posted the same message across multiple subreddits but what is really weird is that your post history does not match with what you just started posting. That is to say I have a suspicion this account was sold due to the out of characteredness of your posts...
Right. The part that keys are required to be quoted comes from Python. I think Douglas Crockford said this in one of his talks.

I just set up Eclipse Che on a test EC2 instance and got 'er running. Never used docker before, seems like a great product. Do you know if Che can run .py files and view graph outputs in the ide?
Interesting. Can you write (a blog or a comment) about the best approach per your experience?
It's a bug in the code. Sometimes error messages flat out lie and say something requires 2 arguments instead of 1 because there are two ways to call the function and you chose the non-standard one. That 1 extra argument is usually a missing self. For that code, I'd start by looking rid of that iter and getting rid of it if you aren't completely sure.
What is the purpose of this operator? Why would we desire such inaccurate math?
16 years! Wow.
Given enough time you'll find a bug in every one of your favorite libraries. My core python fix has to do with the not-so popular struct module. I've seen numpy segfault doing a matrix solve. I was doing maintenance on a Python 2.4 program in early 2.7 days (I still maintain it), so I tried upgrading and fixed it. One scipy fix had to do with certain submodules making it so my program always returned an error code of 0, which made all my broken tests "pass". It also changed across versions of scipy, so I was able to trace it to importing scipy.sparse. Another much more recent scipy bug gave different/wrong results using ckdtree vs the pure python version. Tests are nice. Your tests prevent regressions in other libraries too. 
What are you talking about. It does precisely what it is supposed to do. 
Yeah. Why would I ever want to return a value that does represent an accurate representation. Why would I want this math. I am literally asking why would I ever want to use //. What purpose does this provide? Since you don’t understand let me try to explain it this way: You should be able to reverse any math equation. This loses data. You can’t reverse the equation to arrive at the original data. What purpose does this serve?
What? I have more interests and projects. Some personal, some business. 
Ubuntu 14
Yeah, I like to look on the bright side of things.

Can you clarify how you are opening the file and what you observe when you do this?
I am downloading the zip file from GitHub and opening it in python 
Start with double-clicking the .zip from finder. Then open the files that are extracted. 
Seriously? data = returned_dataframe.values.tolist() Give my £5 to the EFF. 
I can believe that. But what does that have to do with Python? It sounds like you're spamming when you post a call for testers to a bunch of unrelated subs.
That still utilises Pandas though? EDIT: The problem is that NOTHING on the web server can use Pandas, not just my script.
PyTrends does, but you don't. 
Zip file was already extracted but everytime I open a python file and run it, it never works
Exactly. My point is that none of the python scripts or modules on my server can use Pandas.
Oh I see. That's a few hours of work for the best of us. Good luck finding a bite for £5. 
Haha though to. I guess it's time for me to learn Pandas.

Cool, but I wouldn't associate an unregulated data market with democracy.
First point: I do not do drugs, other than the obvious medication that's prescribed to me which is not known to cause any form of irrational behavior other than maybe through tiredness and similar symptoms. I have anxiety and depression, but I was diagnosed with not having schizophrenia. Second point: I already get counseling and my therapist says that she cannot find any fault with my logic. I'm aware that my conclusions seem absurd, but they seem to logically follow nonetheless. Third point: I think you are over certain, and don't know the reasons behind my behavior. I believe that AI has already taken over the world as experts like Elon Musk, Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Hawking fear it might. I believe that we are kept in a computer simulation and our situation is similar to the situation in the evil deceiver argument, where the AI's ability to decieve us casts everything in doubt. As a result, I do not assume that anything is false, and try to explore the things that I might otherwise believe are false, in order to assess if they are likely to be true. My methods might make me seem insane, but they are likely simply beyond your comprehension. In 2015, at the age of 19, my IQ test results returned that I have a 99%ile verbal comprehension intelligence, but a 1%ile processing intelligence. This means I'm a genius, but am very slow to process things. I see others' reasons for not attempting to appease the AI by behaving as the AI might command, but reject them on the grounds of being too risky; finite losses are a small price to pay to avoid infinite losses. Fourth point: Based on your over certainty, I suspect that you will still be convinced I'm insane, but that doesn't concern me. I don't care how others see me. I simply advise you to try to not worry about it and try to stay emotionally healthy despite your perceptions of me Thank you for your concern.
The short version of what I've had the most success with is presenting keys as generalized indices--like list indices but not just limited to sequential integers starting from 0 only. The first activity is actually emulating a list with a dict. Once that idea is solid in the mind, you can start talking about how you can use that in ways that are not obvious to newcomers to the language, and how many constructs from other languages it effectively replaces (structs/simple classes, enums, hash tables, n-d lookup, etc) 
It's really hard to tell what's wrong without knowing what ``result_queue`` is an instance of and what its ``get`` property returns. This is a case where better documentation and/or type hinting would have helped tremendously, but I'm putting my money on ``result_queue.get`` not returning a 4-tuple like the for loop declaration is expecting to unpack.
Python 2 is still a big fraction of the Python user base and will be for a while. Writing code that runs in both usually isn't too hard, so I usually do.
Currently learning how to code a price tracker for iherb. So far got the web scraping part and saving to a db. Now trying to figure out how often to scrape and how to automate it.

Um, finding the midpoint of sequences? The midpoint of a sequence of length 5 is at index 2, not 2.5. Essentially any time you want integer division. FWIW, // in Python 3 is how / works on integers in nearly every other language. ETA: It is also reversible: `a // b * b + a % b == a`
Thanks for your reply :-)
And we still don't have a null coalescing operator. 
Ok. That makes sense. I am still thinking entirely based on math. Somebody else posted a wiki article about quadratics. Thank you for giving an answer.

Good choice. You can certainly get a version of vim with python on it from the repos, and from there you can use `pymode`. You don't need python 3 on vim to effectively develop python 3 code, but it would be nice. You might have to recompile (it takes so long though) 
Is this [math.ceil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.ceil) close enough as I don't see how you could have operators for everything? Having said that, do languages that are targetted at maths provide such things?
Can you open terminal, then run the file there? You may be able to see what errors are thrown there. I am not sure if you are double clicking the python files when you are ha in an issue, but I wonder if the error is displayed too quickly to read.
Here's a link to instructions for those who asked--maybe you don't sew, but in that case your local starving artist would probably follow this pattern for a fee: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0bo69goxqmcee17/Python%20Pattern.pdf?dl=0
Seems to me like you're trying to send one value when you need multiple. If you're sending a list to something that accepts a bunch of values, you can use `*`, try it with `*result_queue.get`.
That begs the question, why even bother having // mean floor when you could just as easily use math.floor(a/b) ? Why not reserve the // for something else ?
You mention hashable a lot (rightfully so), but your definition of hashable is "if passing an object to the hash builtin function doesn’t raise an exception". This misses the entire point of what a hash is, which is fundamental in understanding a dict.
Yes I am double clicking the python files am I supposed to do it a different way???
Run the file from terminal, python &lt;path\to\filename&gt;
I made a Reddit bot but it got suspended
I'm already using socket in the program itself. It's the audio part that I'm confused with.
If you were thinking entirely based on math you would know that integer division is expected to behave as a floor operation because that is how it is defined. 
if you're not including the memory overhead of running spyder itself (which is fairly large), then the difference is minor. Also, spyder by default will probably be using the jupyter engine, rather than raw python interpreter, which has some memory implications.
They let you add to the beginning and end of a function. def say_hi(f, *args, **kwargs): print('Hi') f(*args, **kwargs) print('Bye') Now any function that is decorated with `say_hi` will print hi and bye between. This is useful for complex systems. I could write one that checks if a user is logged in. It saves me from checking if they're logged in in every function.
Properties are a way of making an attribute private with a getter and setter function. So say you have a class named `Foo` with an attribute named `bar`. But then you find that when some external call sets `bar` you need to modify the behavoir of `Foo`. Then you can rename `bar` -&gt; `_bar` and make a property `bar that handles the get and set operations nicely, without breaking any code that calls `Foo`. 
https://docs.openstack.org/pbr/latest/ It is not perfect, but it works. 
Some of this shit looks so cool... I wish I had more time to play around with stuff I don't know about
It's for web devs and in this sub I might find some interested people. What do you recommend?
Properties let you replace 'normal' attribute access (getting and setting an attribute) with a method (ie, methods that you write and control), but still looks like a normal attribute from the caller's perspective (you do not have to use ()). For example, we might have a class that doesn't use properties such as: class HealthMetric(object): """ Holds person's weight and height in kg and m """ def init(self, name, weight, height): self.name = name self.weight = weight self.height = height def get_bmi(self): return self.weight / (self.height * self.height) So this class is nice, but you need to do a function call to get the person's BMI. If you wanted to make the calls a bit more consistent (and make them all look like attribute access), you can use properties! class HealthMetrics(object): """ Holds person's weight and height in kg and m """ def init(self, name, weight, height): self.name = name self.weight = weight self.height = height @property def bmi(self): return self.weight / (self.height * self.height) Now you can get the BMI with just a obj.bmi call instead of obj.get_bmi(). This points out one scenario where properties can feel nice - where you have computed attributes that are completely determined by the state of other attributes/properties. You can also use it to trigger other actions when a property is accessed or set. A common one might be logging - you may want to log whenever a value changes. class ControlValve(object): ... skipping some stuff here ... @property def valve_state(self): return self._valve_state @valve_state.setter def valve_state(self, value): if value != self._valve_state: self.logger.info('Moving to from {} to {}'.format(self._valve_state, value) self._valve_state = value 
If you want to go back you should probably keep each menu in a function. Probably as part of a class.... class menu(object): def menu1: Paste first menu here Def menu2: Menu2 here If choice == 'back': self.menu1() Organizing things in functions/classes is the way to go. Definitely spend as much time as possible learning how to use classes in Python. They're like the most important tool in making good python code.
In my company we run JFrog Artifactory locally, which can be configured to provision Python packages (like a local PyPI). You can publish packages to it as usual with setuptools and install packages with pip (and it has caching functionality against the real https://pypi.python.org/). Works really fine
I think this video explains the power of dictionaries and their underpinnings pretty succinctly as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTZJLJ3Gm6Q&amp;t=484s
Tried to get started with GitLab CI. God that shit's hard af. The process of `ssh`ing into a private server and deploying the build should be a lot easier. I basically wasted my saturday afternoon trying to get this working, and couldn't. Not entirely GitLab's fault, but I wish I could find a guide on how to deploy a simple Python app there.
I'm currently in need to scrap some websites with authentication that I haven't been able to scrap using merely the requests and core libraries. Will definitely try the way describe in the Mastering Python Web Scraping article.

Does anyone know how they pick these top 10 articles? There's so much stuff to read, I can never decide which sites are worth it to spend time on.

Virtualenv has traditionally been the correct solution to your problem. However, there is a library called [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) which I think you will find helpful. It basically adds a layer on top of the built in venv and pip, and organizes the way they interact in a way which is very intuitive; directory-based; and freeing to use different versions of python in a virtual environment. By running: # Make the project directory mkdir ~/project_name &amp;&amp; cd ~/project_name # Activate the virtual environment pipenv ...you will create a venv, which will be stored in a central directory at: # X's are a random string ~/.virtualenvs/project_name-XXXXXX Now, if you go into that directory and run: pipenv shell ... you will enter the environment. Checking the version of python by running: python -V ...you will see that it is your default python version. You can reinitialize the venv in a different version the following ways: # Initialize the environment using the default python2 installation on your system. pipenv --two # Initialize the environment using the default python 3 installation you have on your system: pipenv --three # Initialize the environment using a specific python installation pipenv --python 3.6 # ...or 3.5.2, or 2.7.2, etc. 
Properties are an application of decorators.
It sounds like you are attempting to mock up the parts of the code you need to test. I am not sure why a simple sequence of copy, mutate, compare doesn't effectively test the independence of the two copies. The sub-objects that deepcopy needs to operate on all have refcounts; might `sys.getrefcount` or `gc.get_referrers` help? 
Part of the point of properties is suppose you had a class with a member variable that was dependent on some other subset of the member variables. One important principle of OOP is that calling methods in a class should always leave it in a valid state. If you computed the dependent variable once and then stored the result as a member variable, any time you update one of the members it depends on, you would have to remember to also update the dependent value or otherwise the object would be left in an invalid state. For example, if you stored width, height, and area, you would need a setter function for width and height that recalculates the area any time those values are changed. In contrast, by making the area a property, you could just assign directly to width and height, and the area value would always be correct - no need to have setter functions, no opportunity to forget to update the area value
A manual but easily setup cron job could do something like this each night: git pull python setup.py install or to only touch files when the version changes: git pull python setup.py bdist_wheel; pip install --no-index -v dist/whatever.whl or maybe if you want to pull and build on only one system, setup a file server and do this: wget https://repo.mylocalnet/whatever.whl pip install --no-index -v whatever.whl

Depending on what type of bot you want, keep in mind python won't be fast enough to profit off of micro-structure information frictions.
You could always add a `copied` parameter in `__init__`.
Use Qt and PyQt. It's QML is fantastic. I use PyQt to build the QML then use Qt Creator to deploy it to Android.

It wouldn't be micro transactions but it also doesn't have to be python based honestly.
My friends who are qualified to do this sorta thing already run their own crypto-bots lol. I wish I could, but I work 60-70 hours a week for my real job, so unrealistic. How often do you want it to execute trades? If you want it to grab data from some API and execute a trade only a few times a day or so, that would be somewhat easy to make. If you want it to comb through data that is as fresh as physically possible, and execute vast amounts of trades, then the project will be perhaps an order of magnitude more challenging from an engineering perspective.
I don't anticipate more than a few trades a day. However, I came up with a custom algorithm that is constantly evaluating the other cryptos to determine the next best one to buy WHEN the current trade is completed. There are a total of about 17 trading pairs that are being evaluated at the same time.
You can pip install directly from a git repo: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git
No, it does not. And a side note, that's probably a bad idea.
I'm an absolute beginner trying to do wireless data transmission on Arduinos using NRF24L01's. Python as a language seems simple but I'm not familiar with the NRF library. lot of troubleshooting going on. 
I saw this `heat` magic a while back. It has some **major problems** IIRC it needs the scope of everything to be within the cell, it couldn’t handle some real code I threw at it. It feels like a prettier `line_profiler` with much less functionality. The output from `line_profiler` seems easy to colorize, and I wrote some throwaway code to do that. Let me see if I can dig it up, I’ll dump it on github if I find it
1. Look at the [test code for deepcopy](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/test/test_copy.py). 2. Compare the ids for all attributes as by definition they should all differ.

Too much work was put into this post for me to ignore, saving this so I can work through it later on
depends on what your goals are tbh, for a learning experience it could be fun and rewarding.
I used to tell myself I didn't have time for these things, but you'd be surprised how much time you utterly waste each day. Not saying this is the case, but take a hard look at how you're spending your time on and offline and see if you can redirect some of that to more high quality activities. Made a huge difference for me. 
Yep, so much time spent on reddit
since the s= lives inside the href on the link, you can just use it as the matching parameter with findAll: links = soup.findAll(href=re.compile("s=")) Then you can extract the href attributes for the matching links: [link.get('href') for link in links] Or just the part after the matching se=: [link.get('href').split('s=')[1] for link in links] 
 It would be a good idea to drag pythonistas into the lua direction, so that they can easily learn other languages. Lua would give them one-shot continuations, true lexical closures, and prototypical inheritance, so why not. 
But on the other hand: How would you go about anonymous functions in python? In it's current syntax, they are only allowed to hold exactly one expression. 
I'd take a look on this experimental language from one of the PyPy core devs: https://github.com/fijal/quill, which basically says &gt; General Goals &gt; Take the good parts of Python, get rid of the bad ones and learn from other languages
2: immutable objects (that aren't referencing other, mutable, objects) don't need to be copied. so strings, numbers and empty tuples can have the same id
 for member_new, member_old in zip(object_new, object_old): if type(member_new) not in immutable_types: assert member_new == member_old assert member_new is not member_old if member_new and member_old are iterable: recurse &gt; it doesn't prove that the new instance is a copy. past checking equality and checking IDs, you can't prove or deny if something is a copy or not (and there isn't a reason to) - - - you can always just make your objects practically "immutable" and call it done, sidestep the whole issue and have a better resiliency against future similar issues
Nice that would accurally work.
I find pycharm slow and obtrusive at the moment given my basic understanding of Python. I prefer sublimetext3 (flake8) and a terminal. PyCharm just intervenes too often with syntax and other issues that I find overwhelming right now.
One expression. No statements.
Thank you, I corrected it :)

Python made a odd choice with [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/73a54s/why_does_1_10_0_but_1_10_1/). How does Lua do it?
How about class Copied: copy_test = [[]] c = Copied() c2 = copy.deepcopy(c) c.copy_test[0] is c2.copy_test[0] Didn't test it, might need some adjustments - just an idea. 
How is it a bad choice? That's the most intuitive way to divide two integers. Do you know Euclidean Domains? (Euclidean Algorithm, or Long Division etc...) Pretty much every programming language works this way.
To put it in C++ terms: * A `dict`, as you mentioned, is a hash table. * A `list` is the equivalent to a `std::vector` of type-aware pointers. If you want a list that doesn't have the overhead of type awareness, use a numpy array. * A tuple is just an immutable list. In 3.6, at least, `dict` is ordered by insertion order. You can make a key-sorted dict using `{key: value for key, value in sorted(source_dict.items())} 
I work for a company that provides ETL software to (almost all the) major banks. Banks typically have a 15-20 year upgrade cycle. Most of our clients are just starting to think about migrating off COBOL. The idea of caring about a few years' revision difference is completely anathema to them.
If it has the exact same syntax as Python, where's the benefit? You could always write a Python library to do what you want. You can write `dict = float`, it's completely valid Python. 
The one time I had to use floor division it was for positive numbers. What are realistic use cases for floor division involving negative numbers?
They state the following on the linked page: &gt; Mybridge AI ranks articles based on the quality of content measured by our machine and a variety of human factors including engagement and popularity. Edit: formatting
Hey, thanks for the reply! :) Yes, I'm aware of the C++ facilities. It provides cutting edge data structures. I'm drawn towards python thanks to the dynamic typing, being able to use lru_cache for memoizing, not having to worry about a function failing on an iterable of X while working on an iterable of Y thanks to duck typing. For now, I end up sucking it and porting my python draft to C++ for most competitive coding problems. Sadly, competitive coding interfaces don't support NumPy, Cython, Pypy (mostly). Surprisingly, some don't even support standard Python libraries like functools! I'm hoping to experiment with competitive coding in Haskell, since it is almost as fast as C with extremely fast prototyping (which also doubles as runnable code). I've just started with Haskell however, so need more experience before I can use it seriously.
Alright, that makes quite a bit more sense. The Zen of Python is not to reinvent the wheel, and if your competitive problem is asking you to reinvent the wheel, Python isn't he best language for that. 
I must say I don't really know (just know about it, haven't actually used -- apparently from their docs you need to create a command to do it: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/commands/index.html -- otherwise, use a terminal).
A software engineer is to a civil engineer as an engineer is to an construction worker. They may have a very important role, but at the end of the day, the project should match the engineer's vision. Front end is the thing people interact with, back end is the opposite. A TV is very complicated, but the front end is only a few buttons. It wouldn't be worth it to do a SE degree if you're already have a CS degree. Just read up on software infrastructure design.
Um... anything I freaking want. I have made a bot for a stupid clicker game with several hundred friend codes to enter in every day. I’m working on an arbitrage trading bot for crypto currency, and working on a CNN to use in ML for text classification of medical papers. So it really depends on what you want to do with it. As for the other questions, literally can get the answers to them from google and the ones that can’t be answered by google then you need to be able to answer them for yourself because only you can answer them.
Edit: Of course you downvote the thought out answer that gives actual advice instead of just explaining how to do something that is wrong from the ground up. I'm sorry OP has a blatant [XY Problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem) and that apparently hurt your feelings. This sub is unbelievable sometimes. OP: go to /r/learnpython where this shit belongs. That will teach me to be nice for once and offer help. Waste of 10 minutes of my life. &gt; Can anyone help me in the right direction for how to build an SQLAlchemy query that will output the desired result? I _could_ help you write a query based on that table, but I refuse to be responsible for contributing to the continued use of non-normalized data. You need to fix your data first. Super simple suggestion: Person id name 1 Eric 2 Graham 3 Michael Preferences person_id likes 1 bacon 1 sausage 1 spam .... 3 eggs 3 sausage Then do a `select pref.person_id, p.name, count(pref.person_id) from preferences pref join person p on p.id = pref.person_id group by p.id` to get your results. I'll leave the SQLAlchemy portion of that to you to revisit (or find on SO) as a new learning exercise.
What libraries are those??
"Developer", "software engineer" and "programmer" are pretty much interchangeable terms for a person creating software in the broadest sense of the word. The back-end is the business logic driving the program, while the front end is the interface via which the user interacts (graphical UI in most cases). You don't really need a degree in the field at all to find a good job as long as you have the necessary skills even when the job posting says so. And your degree of Data Science will be more than relevant for most recruiters.
It's always a bad idea to ask a question without providing enough context. 
I think developer is much more like a title of "enthusiasm in developing Python module" 
What does a builder do? Builds things. The things that he builds can vary from a simple table, to a cathedral. A software developer builds software, that can be used to make a fart app on iOs, or software that puts people on Mars. You choose what you want to do with your skills. &gt; what's the difference between a developer and a software engineer? Nothing. Almost nobody who is a software developer is an "engineer" in the traditional sense of the word. If someone tells you they are a software engineer, not a developer, they are full of shit. &gt; What's your advice for me? As a developer, choose your field based on what you really want to do, not because you think it will get you a job. I've seen so many good data scientists, algorithms people etc get into crappy web development because they think it is better from a long term career security point of view, and they universally regret it.
&gt; What do developers do? Develop. &gt; What's the difference between a developer and a software engineer? About $40,000 per year, if your employer is dumb enough. &gt; What's front-end, back-end? The bits on either end of the middle. Think of it like the steering wheel and dials on your dashboard, vs the engine and transmission; the front end is the interface, the back end the work being done. &gt; I have a CS degree in Data Science, I know python and C++. What's your advice for me? Learn more languages, and apply yourself to using the knowledge you gained in the total world. A CS degree does not prepare you for what happens in business, though it does make it somewhat easier to understand what went wrong. &gt; Should I get a software engineering degree? Probably not unless and until you've tried applied software development in the real world for a while, and seen if it takes. Working in teams on an endless list of bugs and features isn't everything in life. &gt; Or take courses in IOS/ Android dev? Only if that's an area of particular interest. &gt; Or stick to Machine learning and AI. If you've got skills in this area, stay in this area, and apply it to real world problems. Right now they're your golden ticket to the Wonka factory. &gt; Can you tell me the difference and how can I apply my skills in any of these areas? No, other than find a job with a company you admire doing work you're actually interested in. This is vastly more important than getting paid way, way more to work for some future business failure trying to *disrupt*, well, anything.
Wohoho, looks like reddit coders and engineers don't like being compared to construction workers. This post is sinking! One thing I'll say for front-end design (and I'm mostly a back-end guy) it's NOT easy. To make a good front-end design, that looks slick WHILE functional takes a LOT of skill.
Guess I didn't weigh my words very well. Oh well. The point I was trying to get across is that devs work towards a product, and software engi's typically focus more on designing the product. Defining APIs, selecting data structures, etc. 
Cool, thanks. Your lines got "s=" links. But I didn't get SCG and ITUS. They should be the following lines after "s=ta_oversold". P.S.: what's the /code encoing in Reddit?
I'm sorry for England too. If I have an annoying task that would take time, like trying to figure out how to schedule a few things, quickly estimate some numbers, write a script that would be a pain to do in excel, etc. 
We simulate advanced nuclear reactors with a huge amount of python plus some fast-running physics solvers that are actually written in Fortran.
As people said above, developer and software engineer are pretty interchangeable terms nowadays. You need not worry about getting a software engineering degree as, these days, companies usually don't care whether you come from a CS or CE background. Frontend is everything that the user sees and interacts with like mobile apps, websites, desktop applications. Backend is usually everything related to the server and things not accessible for the user directly like APIs, business logic, databases, server architecture, etc. With Python, you have a wide spectrum of things to do excluding UI stuff. Though, you can still make native desktop applications in Python (using [TkInter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), I haven't made any desktop apps in Python), that's not Python's specialty, Python shines in the backend department like creating APIs (using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), etc.), writing business logic code, database related stuff ([Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), etc.), etc. Recently, Python is also gaining a lot of traction in Data Science and ML/AI thanks to a myriad of open-source libraries out there ([SKlearn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.scipy.org/), etc.). You can also web scrapping in Python (using [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)). There are also libraries like [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) which are used for image recognition. I would recommend you to stick to AI/ML for now. I have been interviewing candidates for data science and I see a huge plus if they already have a decent experience with Python as our backend is built using Django (and many startups prefer Python because building things gets faster). You can venture into the backend side if you want to, but it's a very vast field in itself and wouldn't be that useful for you. P. S. If you are planning to stick around with Python (and I feel you should), install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). It's a collection of Python libraries made for data science and ML and also has a nice environment management utility which helps you in maintaining multiple Python versions at a time.
Obviously this is not relevant for python (math.ceil), but it is possible to perform ceiling division using floor division and negative numbers: 10//3 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 -(-10//3) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4
Unless you need *all* of the Anaconda packages, just install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and install the additional packages you want. Much smaller download size.
I support clinical applications. I use python to simulate the user experience to benchmark performance and be a bit of a canary that preempts unhappy users. There's so many layers between host, OS, app, databases, web servers that I shouldn't have to care about and I can sum up as "how long does it take to log in, pull up a patient record and if it's greater than X seconds I have a problem"
It's just a bad analogy. Not every engineer does product design. You can also be a software engineer without being a project lead in every project.
Cheers, pretty sure we don't have .edu emails in the UK though
Just for reference, I am downvoting you for your shitty, arrogant edit.
My shop's main output is a django webapp, the use of which is to generate and analyse data based around manually annotating large amounts of image data. I also use it to do computer vision stuff.
The worse problem with python is that in competitive coding like ACM there's time limits witch python exceed for some cases, 
Is the reason for Fortran because it's more bare metal than C++, or just because the old timers wrote it and nobody is willing to convert it and revalidate.
Pls use search for past threads of this question. It's repeated with some frequency.
Data migration from various different systems/databases. The "old school" way was to get spreadsheet print outs of info in those databases and then use excel to transform and upload it into other databases. This can all be done much more efficiently in python (there are packages for querying salesforce, oracle dbs. etc and for web scraping, and of course pandas for processing.)
Any university/school email works. If not, you can add it to their list. Of course you need to be a student.
How do you not know what a developer or software engineer do and having a CS degree at the same time? What do you learn in CS? Sounds like you wasted a lot of time and money on that degree. 
r/cscareerquestions is more suited to these sorts of questions. But we'll need *tons* more information from you to be able to make any recommendations, like: * When did you finish your degree? That was a bachelor's in computer science? * What work experience do you have? * What sort of programming have you done? What have you enjoyed and what haven't you, and why?
If it has the exact syntax of Python, how is it "like" Lua?
That's super interesting! I'm trying to look for ways to incorporate python into our day to day processes. I know database conversion is something that we do as well. Do you mind elaborating more on this? Can pm if you want, too.
That's nice.
Most recent project was a command line utility to allow developers to quickly customise virtual machines and then automatically provision them and install the software they need.
You should ask on /r/learnpython Here's a quick description of what you could do: import requests import time LOG_FILE = "internet.log" while True: # TODO: Open the log file and check what the latest status was # Request a URL, specify a timeout so we don't wait forever try: requests.get("http://www.google.com", timeout=30) except (ConnectionError, requests.exceptions.Timeout): # Internet is down! # If Internet was already down (which we know from reading the log file), do nothing # TODO: Otherwise, write something to the file to say that the downtime just started else: # Internet is up! # If Internet was already up (which we know from reading the log file), do nothing # TODO: Otherwise, write something to the file to say that the downtime just ended and tweet # Wait a minute before checking connection again sleep(60) 
Why not a telegram group?
I wish I could help more than simply upvoting for visibility, but your English is just fine. \^_\^
I'd start by writing a function that handles posting a tweet (probably by just hiding the details of some twitter module and your API keys) the format you want, taking parameters for the count and times of day. You could use either Unix timestamps or Time objects (either the result of two `time.localtime()` or `time.time()` calls, which you can then turn into a string with `time.strftime()`). Test it and make sure it works. Then, write a function that detects whether the Internet is accessible. Doing a ping and a DNS lookup is probably enough, but you might want to detect them separately, so you know it's either a DNS outage or a network outage. You can do DNS lookups with `socket.gethostbyname()`. You can do an ICMP ping by running the command-line tool `ping` with `subprocess.Popen()` or `subprocess.call()` to a server you need access to during the outage, or you can use `socket.open()` to attempt a connection if ICMP is blocked. Test it and make sure it works. Then, in your main function, implement a loop that handles those checks on some reasonable interval that will detect your outages (if your outages are generally more than 3 minutes long, have your main loop wait 1 minute between checks, for example; if you check too often, it might look like some kind of DoS attack). When there's an outage, get the current time, increment a local counter variable, and shorten the interval until the outage ends, get the current time, send the tweet, and save the outage times to the end of a log file (for an audit trail). At the beginning of the loop, you can set your counter based on the number of lines in your audit log.
I work at a conservation authority. I use it everyday from building web apps, to managing big data, to GIS to all sorts of shit. It's essential in our workflow. Coolest thing I did recently with it, was automating our planners work flow. They select a property and about 15 maps and reports are automatically created. We've bee able to get the plan review time down from a day to less than an hour. 
Hisssssssssssssssss.
In the Networking world, we have labs of switches and routers that our engineers will reserve/use for a period of time before releasing the equipment back into the inventory pool for someone else to use. These guys never erase the configurations they put on the devices so I have python code using the pexpect library telnet/ssh into a device and run the commands to erase configurations and reload the device and then just put the ip address, subnet &amp; gateway back on. or sometimes tftp a config file back onto the switch
What's even the point of learning to program at this point?
This is just me, so I don't know if I'm doing it right, but then again I'm working solo with only 1 GPU so I don't have many options. What I do is kinda wing it. I figure out the best hyperparameters to initially train with. When (not if) those don't work, I keep tuning them and then re-training. It's super repetitive and time consuming. So I'm also very curious if someone has a better alternative.
I am in the top 0.2% of Project Euler (sorted by solved problems) using only python as programming language. It is a very common language on PE.
I work at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. We use it for literally every thing. Some infrastructure guys use additional, specific tools like Ruby and I write javascrpt in conjunction with flask at times, but 99% of it is python here. UI, web, analysis, systems - all of it.
To add to your answer. include this [twitter api package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter) and initialize it. You'll need to go to the developer section on twitter while logged into your account and generate an API key. a bit of googling should help out. Also import os in order to interact with the log file. if you want to be fancy you could add in date time too so your tweet will tweet out the time it went down. Full code could look like this. import requests import time import os import datetime from twitter import * t = Twitter(auth=OAuth(token, token_key, con_secret, con_secret_key)) LOG_FILE = "path/to/internet.log" internetstatus = "Up" while True: # TODO: Open the log file and check what the latest status was # Request a URL, specify a timeout so we don't wait forever try: requests.get("http://www.google.com", timeout=30) except (ConnectionError, requests.exceptions.Timeout): # Internet is down! if internetstatus == "Up": now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') t.statuses.update(status="@tyrellrunmage Internet went down at"+now) internetstatus = "Down" with open(Log_File,'a') as f: f.write("Interet is went down at "+now+"\n") else: now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') with os.open(Log_File) as f: f.write("Interet is still down at "+now+"\n") else: # Internet is up! if internetstatus == "Down": internetstatus = "Up" now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') t.statuses.update(status="@tyrellrunmage Internet back up at"+now) with open(Log_File,'a') as f: f.write("Interet is back up at "+now+"\n") # If Internet was already up (which we know from reading the log file), do nothing # TODO: Otherwise, write something to the file to say that the downtime just ended and tweet # Wait a minute before checking connection again sleep(60) Note: its better practice to keep your API credentials in a text file or key file. Then import and pass that file to the Oath()
I built a clock for our manufacturing space that displays the date, UTC time, and outside temp. We set the bios time to UTC on the servers we sell and needed an easy to see clock. After getting a clock off Amazon that was utter crap I decided to make a clock app that we could display anywhere and is easy to see. I developed it at home so it remain my app since I’m not a developer at my company, but the one installed at work is labeled “companyname the UTC Clock” because moichendaising...our sales guy didn’t get it, he’s grumpy and needs to watch more movies.
&gt; Ps. Sorry for england Is that because they [rely on Ruby](https://github.com/alphagov?language=ruby)? ;)
I often have people refer to conversations from yesterday for any conversations that may take place in the present because I can’t be arsed to have that conversation again.
It looks like those _cli tools are included with the python package, it might simply be an issue with setting the path correctly. You could try using the gui tool if you don't want to get too indepth with command line stuff. Just make sure you go through the install process outlined in the readme.
If it takes more than 3 minutes then it should be automated with python.
Most of our backend service code is in Python.
What is a telegram group..? I'm unfamiliar with that. Everyone uses discord these days, to my knowledge, and I believe it would be fairly difficult to convince a millenial audience to use something that even has an antiquated title (telegram, seriously?). I've never heard of it, and just asked my MIS peers and they haven't either. https://www.slant.co/versus/4568/5637/~telegram_vs_discord

&gt; Last time I checked, python was open minded The Zen Of Python is the opposite of being "open minded"; it expresses the design philosophies of Python. C++ is designed by committee and never says no to anything. They're the exact opposites philosophically.
&gt;Instead of using indentation based syntax like in Python we go with braces &gt;and semicolons like in Rust. I stopped reading at that point. The developer and I clearly differ on what the good parts of Python are.

What is a "competitive coding", anyway? As a former C++ developer, I don't agree with your adjectives. Or, at least I myself liked coding in C++, since it allows you to use higher level abstractions, while - and this is crucial - not compromising on performance. Ok, I like python more in general, and I like its elegance, but let's admit, that it sometimes achieved at the expense of performance. So, different things for different uses.
A bit of both. We have old codes that are screaming fast and validated so why not use them, and some guys write new codes in Fortran 90 because it's fastest
&gt; and never says no to anything That is not true.
This is what initially we did, but after reading Uber post related to how they are training data, I was interested in improving our architecture even better. As we in the process of adding more ML models to solve problem, this can get really time-consuming especially on small team.
Thanks a lot guys, a lot of information here :).
Lol I'm sure been discussed a thousand times in class, but now that I am applying for Jobs I need to understand this stuff more and from a business side 2. I took data structures, Systems, algo, C++ both accelerated and optimized and many data science like Neural nets, ML, Big Data mining etc. It's more focused on math and stats modeling.
MS recent grad, all my experience is in data analytics, building statistical models for financial services and analyzing data. Hadoop, Data mining, SQL etc. None of which had me involved in developing an app or any back end, front end or back testing softwares etc. Just 3 years from undergrads and recently finished grad. 
I do a fair amount of competitive programming in Python, and the recursion thing is the only common issue. Most commonly recursive problems have fairly intuitive iterative solutions. Can you give an example of a situation where you needed a balanced BST? If you need a minheap, the heapq module exists, and pretty much every other use case is covered by dict and list. Unfortunately, yes, ICPC is too strict on Python TLs. Most challenge websites offer increased TLs for Python, though.
Going by the [setup file](https://github.com/mvhenten/pylatscan/blob/master/python/setup.py#L39) pylatparse_cli is simply calling[ this script](https://github.com/mvhenten/pylatscan/blob/master/python/pylatscan/controller/parser_cli.py) you could try to run it directly and see if it works.
Wait...what's wrong with mutable global variables? It's just global, not static global. Also, why are the spaces braces and the braces actually brackets?

I work for a systematic fund. Everything is written in Python.
It's not odd. Why would floor return a greater number than ceil?

Ask on /r/learnpython and post a minimal code example
Django web applications, machine learning. For tools and automating the boring stuff, mostly Perl actually.
We are all sorry for England. I work for a bank and use Python to build reports and send them out daily via email. Added to that we have built stand-alone apps to perform tasks that require accessing data in large databases. Just started with migrating all of this to a server and hosting it there using Flask. *Anything that can be done with Excel can be done much better and faster with Python.* My goal is to kill all use of Excel and VBA within the bank.
I didn't know it. O will study it. Thanks for the advice. 
We automate all our reports with VBA. What are the benefits of instead using python? I've tried and failed to install python because of IT restricting it. How do you guys get around this?
You haven't given much information here, but this sounds like a task that may be better suited to Apps Script.
Fortran deals with arrays better than C++, and has a much less cryptic pointer syntax, so you get less memory leaks etc. I find it easier to integrate Fortran code into Python/numpy, partially because of the treatment of arrays. Modern Fortran can also do OOP if you like, so the advantages of C++ might be smaller than you think. I'd argue that Fortran is a higher level language than C++, and except for a couple of archaisms, can often be easier and tidier for numerical work than C++, which can often become very cryptic. The advantage of C++ is its widespread use (why learn Fortran for a potential small benefit if you already know C++ or is relatives) and its flexibility (i.e. don't use Fortran for anything other than numerical work if you value your sanity)
&gt;What is a "competitive coding", anyway? Well, competitive coding usually tests the ability to come up with good performing solutions to a somewhat mathematical problem. That involves good algorithms &amp; data structures, and sometimes still, efficient programming. &gt; and I like its elegance, but let's admit, that it sometimes achieved at the expense of performance. So, different things for different uses. I am not asking to solve those challenges where clever bit level or pointer hacks are required just to get that value to hit the cache. I am looking towards solving problems that should be perfectly doable in Python, if only the standard library supported something that is "pythonic" and useful and easy. &gt; since it allows you to use higher level abstractions Oh nono.. C++ doesn't. Not with that horrific syntax. Yes, it is Turing Complete, so is assembly. Yes, you can do anonymous functions and use the template library in clever ways to simulate python decorators, and it tries to inherit the good functional stuff from Haskell, but look at the mess you end up with at the end! Python has syntactic sugar, which is absolutely necessary. C++ has been around for a long time, It is widely used today, there's a cult around it, it is fast. But it is not a good programming language. Not by a great margin. -- -- I'm sorry if I'm just ranting at this stage, but I passionately hate programming in complicated languages like C++. It is both complex "and" complicated. It gets in the way of the programmer. It forces you to stop your train of thought and wrestle with the language for so long that you've already forgotten the things about the problem that actually matter.
Numpy/Scipy use the Lapack and Blas libraries which are written in Fortran. Performance wise the Fortran implementations are solid.
I automate miscellaneous stuff for my clients. E.g. I usually write scripts to scrap data and send it via sms if a certain condition is met. PS - Don't worry my friend, I'm deeply sorry for England too.
Yeah, Project Euler doesn't have time constraints., and you can use any library you want. You only gotta submit answers, and not solutions. But haven't you run out of recursion depth even once while doing PE!? Sure, you can get around by doing a bottom up dynamic programming, maintain the cache manually and iterate over the argument.. I always have to write it in a top down recursive fashion and convert it to bottom up. Guess I just suck at DynaP?
They're finally gonna migrate from COBOL? Damn, there goes my ultimate fallback plan... I can't imagine supporting the banking industry. Is it hectic?
I second this. I've used this same approach to teach dictionaries to biologists, and it seems to work very well. 
It also depends what do you code. I worked with embedded and realtime systems, and there you just need control of the hardware, you need to know how much memory your data structure consumes, etc. But C++ has rather steep learning curve, thats true. I always laugh when so much people criticise C++ for being a horrible language, and then they want to choose some high performance language, and then they arrive to... C++, even for new projects. :-) Anyway, what are some good competitive coding competitions to join?
Yep, considering how Python is much slower whenever you need to do a heavy loop in it (which cannot be delegated to the interpreter - like `sum()`). It is sad that most places don't give a generous time limit extension. Well, the problems isn't just with Python. Codeforces for example forces you to use `scanf` rather than `cin`, just because it is faster. And the community quickly gets toxic when people request to atleast use somewhat modern tools like `cin` and `cout`! Example: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20977 (-22 votes)
We use Python as the main language to power our website.
I use python along with other technologies like automator and keyboard maestro to automate my work. I also built [a framework for building selenium automations in a more sane way](https://github.com/Wykleph/selenext). I use that for creating persisting web automations for interacting with sites that don't have apis. I have database queues that i put data in, the selenium automation checks the queue, does the work, and puts results into the database. With the way the framework is set up you can create a Controller object(workflow code) that works for whatever Page obeject(holds element definitions and returns WebElement objects)you instantiate it with. So if you wanted to do a bunch of searches across different websites that share the same workflow(logging in to web apps, filling out forms, etc.), you only need to write the single Controller. It also comes with things like: * Functions for pulling stuff like login details from a specific file instead of having it hard coded which makes sharing your Controllers safe * Requests WebReader object so you can use Requests(and a couple other modules) to _read_ information off of a webpage(you just cannot interact with the webpage). You call selenium methods that return custom WebElements that work like selenium WebElements. You can even do something like `reader.find_element_by_id("content").find_elements_by_tag_name("tr")`. This saves a ton of overhead if you dont need to interact with a page and it won't break controller code that doesn't interact with a webpage * Integration with Peewee database module. * Importable function for generating all the files and folders to start a project with the framework(including Peewee files for using a database) 
I'm a Python developer. &gt;What do developers do? Write Python for money. Python has quite a lot of uses, and I'm working on a few fairly big, monolithic projects. I've carved out a little niche for myself, I develop a lot of (proprietary) integration libraries and dabble in service bus architecture between large government-based services. It seems like a lot of Python developers lack knowledge of what you can basically call XML based protocols, like SOAP and SAML. So I do shit like that for them. (For another month. Off to be a consultant after that. Hello Java, it's been a while.)
I'm a SaaS developer and my team uses Python for basically everything.
&gt; then they want to choose some high performance language, and then they arrive to... C++, even for new projects. :-) Blame that to lack of alternatives.. Let me repharse. lack of alternatives that have a sufficiently large userbase so that you can Google your error and find an answer, a sufficient awareness (you don't find many jobs for language X if hardly anyone knows about it). -- -- &gt; Anyway, what are some good competitive coding competitions to join? https://www.hackerrank.com has a beautiful interface, but the problems are somewhat easy (I can do them with some difficulty). Lots of websites have pretty bad interface. http://codeforces.com has a decent interface and some really challenging problems (usually segmented and labelled by difficulty) I dislike https://www.codechef.com/ interface, but their community is solid and helpful. https://www.topcoder.com/ is somewhat intimidating for me.. All these websites conduct regular competitions and are great places for practising. Some great competitions include Google [CodeJam Kickstart](https://code.google.com/codejam/kickstart/), ACM ICPC..
DynaP is a very useful tool to have in the hat. If nothing else, the math is sometimes simpler than recursive formulas. Sometimes the recursive depth is in the 100s of thousands and dynamic programming on arrays will be way faster. 
Sorry for the off topic question but what exactly is a conservation authority?
I think I was not clear enough in the first post: s=ta_oversold is the indicator that the following tab-link text, e.g., SCG and ITUS, should be extracted.
Not sure if this helps, but I was at a conference last week listening to the guys from NVIDIA talk about this... It seems the choice of framework is super important and depending on what you're training you should choose the framework accordingly. They were even a bit scathing of tensorflow, and showed that while its good for some shit, it's terrible for other shit. I also listened to a guy who had some really impressive models and he was saying he had to completely build his own deep learning framework on top of CUDA... it was seriously impressive what they could do though
I'm a developer on a Node.js project, so my main use for Python is just as a calculator. :/ On the bright side, it works better than any GUI calculator that I've come across. :)
We have a set of reports from a logging appliance that we use for training. However, these logs don't show up in the logging appliance's system unless they are fewer than a year old. So, once a year, we run a python script that goes through and increments the lines of data by a year. Or, I should say, that's what we're going to do going forward. Before I started here, someone was spending two days (a literal 48 hours over two weeks) straight going through all the log files and find-replacing all of years. Sounds quick, right? We have thousands of log files. So I wrote a script that did exactly what one person did in 48 hours of billable time in approximately thirty seconds. I've done similar scripts for things like ip address obfuscation, things like that.

Just curious, why would I want to use this as opposed to just using SQLAlchemy alongside an Async driver compatible with SQLAlchemy? Both Aiohttp and Sanic have examples you can look at.
Conserving wildlife and natural resources (parks) probably, judging by the fact that they do GIS stuff. 
This is a nice idea but likely unsafe for you personally. Suppose your service is compromised and introduces a virus into the executables it generates - then you are responsible. Suppose someone develops clever code that is benign when run from source but becomes malicious when converted to executable by your software - then you appear to be responsible for generating malware but cannot readily prove your innocence. 
Ah yeah sounds interesting Im currently looking for a job like that... Im tired of doing work that is meaningless to the worlds big picture.
I use it for scripting repetitive tasks in Blender (which has its own Python console).
We use python mostly in web applications and data analysis. Most recently I rewrote some numerical calculation services in python so we could take advantage of numpy.
For a beginner Variables, strings, integers, conditions (if, else), for loop, there are a lot of online tutorials and fast courses if you just want to be familiar with the basics. 
This might not be the answer you are looking for, but if you want to get into web development I recommend a framework like Django.
Thanks!!
no problem
is it there when you do "view source" in your browser? If it's not there in "view source" then requests + beautifulsoup (or similar) can't see it, and you need to use something like PhantomJS or Selenium to actually run the javascript. (or figure out where the js is getting the data from, possibly an ajax request or something, and then scrape that).
My workplace uses Python all over! We're an animated movie studio using Maya, so we create custom tools in the application using PyQt for our animators to shortcut processes that the app isn't prepared for. We also deploy tons of internal web apps, and if it requires access to our database, we create APIs with Django. Another big use case is Sentry.io Error logging done right, frankly.

I built a simple hipchat bot with flask that people can use as migration token (so other people don't start a new one when one is already in progress). We have also a database that use Lua as programming language, it's painful, so I decided to give a try to python. I use python to fire some SQL queries and work with the results. I think I will refuse the library I wrote to manage the queries for other projects. 
working on code that compares data received from 3rd party as csv, to data loaded in hive (for confirmation that all data is loaded as received). 
Developer : Software Engineer :: Janitor : Sanitation engineer. In other words, it's nothing but a puffed up title.
We use python for tasks that aren't latency sensitive, or for larger more complicated scripts that bash would feel too clunky for.
ask r/learnpython/
This might not be your expected answer either but wear sunscreen. That's a good advice. 
I am doing a similar process, and my current workflow is to grab the SQL DB tables using a standard select query, dump them into a Pandas dataframe, rename columns if need be, re-index it to use a new set of columns as well as the renamed ones, add details or run transformations, output to a CSV file for import (no direct DB access on the new app, so have to use their importer).
My company has been pushing for Python so hard that all new hires (myself included) are required to go through PRNE training. So once I start work on my team, I'll likely use Python to automate tasks like pulling information from customer routers/switches, parsing large 'show tec' files and general data parsing/manipulation. Mostly, the training helped me learned how to use libraries (pexpect and Paramiko) for interfacing with networked devices, and then I can apply my other Python knowledge from undergrad for the data parsing/file manipulation aspect of it.
Do you create your reports with reportlab?
