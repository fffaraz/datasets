If I may, what you're saying is quite unfair. Compared to the majority of lists out there, this one is very light in terms of self-promotion.
You're welcome [focus0501](https://www.reddit.com/user/focus0501)! :)
Yes, I've been following the author after reading this specific piece. Cheers!
The books are not good, you're better of reading Wikipedia entries on topics that are covered here. I paid $15 for the complete pack, skimmed over most of the books yesterday. There is very little, if any, added value in these compared to the top hit on a google search or the man page of a utility.
I am trying to write a simple script to log and plot the CPU temperature using lm-sensors and matplotlib, serve it through bottle. The CPU in question sits beneath an AC in our lab, so we can always be sure that we turned off the AC after leaving lab. The CPU is used as a file server and its loads hardly reaches above 5%, so the CPU temperature is always pretty stable.
This is a great library but it's a massive pain to get this to run in virtualenv. I went with wxPython which has been easy to get to grips with and it has a RAD tool called wxFormBuilder for quick mockups.
&gt;Very nice! Is it oc? Yes, thanks
wxFormBuilder is great. Such an easy way to throw GUIs together and get it to spit out the code into as an Abstract Python class. Really powerful tool for creating wxPython GUIs
Yeah, just make a post with what you just said. You'll get more responses that way. 
That was before I had a CI set up and by the time I got my CI setup, I didn't have the options for older versions of python. That was also before I used Anaconda that allowed you to just create a different version of Python. I used one version of Python 2.7.6 and then jumped to 2.7.8. I'd occasionally run the Python 3.x tests, but I'd only test one version of 3.x. I dunno, maybe don't fundamentally break backwards compatibility with Python 2.7.7? There was forwards compatiblity, so Python 2.7.6 code ran in 2.7.7, but not Python 2.7.7 code in 2.7.6. The module six's function b(...) not actually converting to unicode to bytes on Python 2.7 didn't help; it's just a pass because Python 2.x randomly converts strings to what they need to be. I'm all for bug fixes, but the enhancement should never have been made for Python 2.7.7. It was so people could use the same code unannotated code (they didn't have to type the `b` in `b'&lt;4i'`) in Python 2.7 as 3.4, but if you imported `unicode_literals`, you made your life harder. I didn't care so much about 2.7.6, but rather Python 2.6 and 3.2/3.3.
Thanks very much for this. I will be trying this tomorrow. 
Is this just an alt API for qt or does it add functionaiity? It saddens me how hard some basic UI stuff is to do with older GUI libraries. It's very annoying to implement graphical drag and drop (where it drags the item itself, and not outline of it), or screen shake with certain libraries.

The best option for something like this is to not run your bot over ssh at all, and use a service manager like systemd to manage it. What distribution are you running on your EC2 server?
Learning the basics of an AI assistant based in Python. Also, picking back up various linux os for my devices and re-learning that whole system. 
IMO, I think you can use selenium to load the web page, then use beautiful soup to take the content. Then strip the HTML tags, put the left content to PDF.
Assuming your bot does not exit by itself or crashes at some point, running from a command line should help. Just make sure it is not closed on session disconnect. 
I thing every library should do one thing, and do it very well. Sanitizing user input is a difficult problem, with tons of edge cases. I was worried that our approached missed something. That’s why I was looking for a library, because it would cover a lot more of those edge cases.
Well... that's a bummer. :/

Oh then yeah Windows 10. And I connect with a Remote Desktop Connection, which to my understanding uses RDP.
I'll give that a try, thanks!
So you're running Windows 10 on your remote instance, and you're running PyCharm under that, and you're running your script under PyCharm?
Exactly
That sounds like an extremely convoluted setup. Why not just run your script in a Linux environment instead?
Your example is too complex for me to read (its a wall of text) and I don't know if it is the *desired* output or the *undesired current* output. You should simplify your examples to make it easier on the people you are asking to volunteer their spare time to solve your problem for free. How about a *simple* example, like: changes = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] order = [3, 2, 0, 1] Desired output: `'d', 'c', 'a', 'b'`. Modify to suit your actual needs.

A simple google search "python save html as pdf" would have answered your question. But, IMO pdfkit, xhtml2pdf and/or wkhtml2pdf (which are pretty much better implementations of the same library) will do the trick.
It's an alternative API. The exact same API calls are available on the tkinter version as the Qt version. PySimpleGUI replaces those GUIs APIs with its own. This gives you the ability to move from tkinter to Qt by changing only the import statement. Start on tkinter, move to Qt if you want to get better looking widgets. 
It shouldn't be. It's either a pip install, or if that fails you, it's a single file named PySimpleGUI.py file that you put in your application's folder. Can you share more about your problem? Maybe there's an easy solution. Want to make sure others don't have the same experience.
I like the idea XD
Just run a while loop and check the time and date.
There are [16 Qt specific examples](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIQt/Demo%20Programs) and [115 normal PySimpleGUI examples](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms) (that can all be easily "ported" by usually a 1-line, import change).

Maybe you're tackling it from a wrong perspective, or from a too abstract and theoretical stand point? &amp;#x200B; Make a bunch of small piece of papers (maybe it could help to have them squares or circles or just use some post it if you have them at your disposal). Write some random numbers on them. &amp;#x200B; Try to build a binary tree using those pieces of papers and choosing them randomly. If you search a number with your finger, you will touch at most as many numbers as the height of your three. &amp;#x200B; Now try to start with your smallest number, and build your (not balanced) BST using the natural order of your numbers, from the smallest to the biggest. In this case you have built a BST but effectively your finger will have to traverse all the number to get to the biggest, so you have a pretty bad binary search. &amp;#x200B; Now try to see if you can come up with a series of rules (algorithm) to make your tree self-balancing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It was a few weeks ago but if I remember correctly it was a pip install in a Python 3 venv running on Ubuntu 18.04 that just wouldn't take. A few searches made it look like it was an issue some other folks were having and I left it at that. I haven't tried placing PySimpleGUI.py directly in the folder myself - I'll try it a little later and get back to you!
Dude, this looks really cool! I develop on Linux and just added cross-platform support for a PySide2 application I'm making that makes a lot of references to files. After taking a brief look at the code, it shouldn't be *too* difficult to add Linux support for most of it, though there seems to be some weird things happening in [`/utils/utilities`](https://github.com/Thomasedv/Grabber/blob/master/utils/utilities.py) which could complicate things. It looks like you import a lot of things that reference windows specifically, so that will have to be changed. I'll take a crack at it and make a pull request if anything comes of it :)

There’s not much emphasis on security. 1) data is not sensitive 2) there aren’t anybody in the institute that have the expertise. Thanks anyway
 gdb python r -c 'import ctypes' Will tell you a lot more than anyone reading your post, most likely. You are kind of lucky that the segfault doesn't happen when Python exits and starts garbage-collection cycle, so, you have a good chance that it breaks where you have an error, and not in some random place eons later.
I want to build one, however limited it is, using Python3
I think the things you mention are just part of a function that is not used unless you toggle something manually in the settings. A if statements, in one or two places checked which platform it is, should fix it, so it just doesn't do anything at all if it isn't windows and someone still toggled that setting. Most changes would probably be in the filehandler class, i hope, since part of the reasoning for using it was that eventually i could be tweaked to handle all path related stuff.
See post above, I edited as you responded.
I code as a hobby. So ain’t really got much time for research. I appreciate your help. 
There are better, but not as ubiquitous, so I tend to stick to Tk.
My great wtf moment was reading about the Olson database, which collects information about time zones and things like daylight saving times. There is some crazy stuff in there. I think the best thing was a country where trains used a separate time with a delta of something like 17 minutes.

You should definitely look at some fundamental programming topics like algorithms, datastructures and so on after getting a grasp on python. So you are able to understand what a list really is and how to solve problems effectively. &amp;#x200B;
How doesn't it? 
I know this may not be a popular answer but learn the basics about programming first THEN learn a language. I have seen too many horrible programmers that have no clue about OOP. Knowing the three principles of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism) will get you further in your i.t. career. Start with Harvard's CS50x class first, it is a great foundation to learning how to program: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x It's free or you can pay $90 for a certificate from Harvard when you successfully pass the course.

You said that you have intermediate level in Python, then you should already have a clue about architecture and basic networking. Chat are usually beginner projetcs so you really should learn about security if you plan to continue to improve your level. Security is never an option. Also, your two points don't make sense. 1) Data is never sensitive, until someone start to use your app for sensitive things. You can't control your users, someone will always do something stupid. 2)

Apple doesn't rely on their system python2, they've left it to bit rot for a number of releases and have even broken it; I wish they'd just purge it and let others provide a proper python when users want. 
so Anaconda's python (and everything else) is completely isolated and separate from the system, and will install fine on my OS X 10.10.x ? 
i completely agree with you, but wouldn't focus too much on OOP in the beginning. some fundamental knowledge about programming and what is means to program will help much more. a good address to start is here: [Structure and Interpretation of Computerprograms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start)
This should get you started on reading from files: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files You might also want to check out r/learnpython or r/learnprogramming
You can try the EAP version, it's their beta version which is free for non-commercial use. You can also evaluate the Ultimate version for free for 30 days, including commercial use, or you can get a student license if you're a student or an educator.
Yes absolutely. You can develop android apps using kivy and PyMob tools of python. 
Never mind. Solved my problem. Funny how you can search for an answer for so long and come up empty handed only to figure it out after you ask for help. 
That is something I was thinking about. I was not sure that both versions will happily coexist. Will they? If the new one is just somewhere in user space? Like ~/playground/ ? But what if I need some additional libraries or tools? 
Good I ll try it
`pip` and `pip3` will manage the libraries for Py 2 and 3 separately, so everything’s fine here, just be careful as to which version (`pip` or `pip3`) of the package manager you use. I’m not sure what you mean by “user space”. Python3 is installed in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/&lt;version_number&gt;`. 
What dont you understand?
I’d say nothing beats pipenv.
As the creator of Masonite you should deff pick Masonite :) Fully biased answer. If you need more support then you can join the slack channel: [https://slack.masoniteproject.com](https://slack.masoniteproject.com).

yup It is stated [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#installing-conda-on-a-system-that-has-other-python-installations-or-packages) on the Anaconda's site
Anaconda is the way to go, or miniconda if you want to control which packages are installed. This is my go-to installation method for python on macOS.
I'm well aware. Didn't initially know when i started my project though. However, i realised it was more useful to have it use the executable because freezing python and thus youtube-dl into a .exe will leave you unable to update youtube-dl. That's not that good if the i have to make an updater for my executable(or force users to download a new one every time there is a new version) as well as I'd need to build new versions of my program every time youtube-dl gets updates. And for my hobby needs, that's simply not doable in terms of time and effort. Of course, the drawback is that i can only do so much with the captured output of the executable, but it works good enough and i have made some fancy coloring on the percentages to keep the log output nice. 
This is a novel solution to your problem. Awesome work! Thanks for writing it up. A few things I noticed: You created your own login/authentication implementation. This is fraught with unforseen problems. It's generally recommended that you adapt an existing, mature implementation. The answers didn't have audio. If they can't read the questions, how can they read the answers. There was definitely "help" provided to those that couldn't read. You didn't ask for a grammar lesson but if you are interested in cleaning up your English grammar, I suggest you have a look at the use of the [bare infinitive after the use of do, did, or does](https://www.myenglishpages.com/site_php_files/grammar-lesson-infinitive.php). One would say/write, "I did have" and not "I did had". You seem to write well in English, but there were a few common mistakes I noticed in your writing. This one was most noticable.
Sounds like your project is big enough for Django now, but only if you want to save time by having everything already working out of the box.
Simply because you say this means you should look for a different path. Not understanding why security is important means this is a bad idea. Sorry to be harsh. There are plenty of open source projects that you can install and give you the functionality you want. Use something that someone else has written. 
Here’s my 2c, technically yes. I suggest you to take a look at [how YouTube register views.](https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/how-does-youtube-count-views) It will be almost impossible for you to boost views on YouTube due to their detection algorithms and human screening. Also VPN is a bad idea as you’ll need thousands of IP address and no VPN provider have that many address.
Thanks for sharing! Great work! I am attempting to use it now.

Note: as of 11/29/2018, if you need to use Tensorflow, Python 3.7 is not supported.
So the number is not random? Which pattern does it follow?
You can even create separate conda python environments from the main one you install with anaconda, allowing for different environments for different purposes, i.e., one for python2.7 and one for python3.6. &amp;#x200B;
The official tutorial is actually a pretty good place to start, and the price is right: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
SO surveys are just what you expect from a site that started out as 90% jquery snippets though...according to their community JS is the most popular language for basically everything.
Python is the easiest way to use it but it's always been a wrapper over a C++ library that was a wrapper over a tensor library that...so it's not very surprising that new ways to use it are interesting to people.
I suspect trauma from Objective-C. It's certainly far more rage inducing than Java or C#. I'm going to assume they're apple developers since objective c is almost unknown outside of there, and wonder why they didn't look at Swift.
C# is already pretty rage inducing haha :D And I always wondered where objective C was used

a good article, although all the links make it hard to read from mobile
I was a jailbreak developer. And yes i still have PTSD from my time with Obj-C. Especially when you using it in a way that wasn't mean't to be accessible in the first place lol
Actually there are over 130 examples between the Tk and Qt version!
Might give watchdog a try. [https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/](https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/)
The scripting language that Mac's rely on is Ruby, most other unix environments use python. I'd recommend taking the time to learn how to set up your system with multiple versions of python and virtualenv.
if these applications will be addressed by their IPs then you are looking for a single sign on server. If you can host them under the same domain as subdomains, then you're looking for cookies set on the superdomain (which can be read by all subdomains). alternativily if you are willing to change host file on every computer you will be accessing them from, you can use the second method like that without actually owning any domain
You can use the github advanced search feature https://github.com/search/advanced to try and find something to your liking. Put in some key words and you can find bigger or smaller repos by changing the 'size' and popularity by 'stars' or whatever. 
Ever played "guess the number"? That's how a binary search tree is organized. If the number is higher, go right, if it's lower, go left. And so on. Once you get a simple tree going, the next step is to optimize it. You want to minimize the height of the tree, and to do so you have to change the topmost nodes. Disclaimer: I literally learned these a couple weeks ago.
In anaconda I have an issue with cartopy import... How can i fix that ?
What part are you having trouble with?
well pretty much all of it. say, how do i create this 2d array, and how do i fill it up? how does it correspond to the plot i need to make? and how do i make said plot?
I think ARM will start getting much more attention now that Amazon has ARM based instances for cheap. 
The connection to the thread. Has nothing to do with PySimpleGUI that I could find. Maybe you can point out the connection better than what I'm seeing.
Reading over the documentation, I'm not convinced that DNS errors are caught by Retry(). You could either [deal with DNS manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22609385/python-requests-library-define-specific-dns) or implement a manual retry system by catching the ConnectionError in a loop: `retry_counter = 0 max_retries = 10 backoff_factor = .3 while retry_counter &lt; max_retries: try: response = session.request(**signature) except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as ex: if "Name does not resolve" in str(ex): retry_counter += 1 print("Retry {}/{}".format(retry_counter, max_retries)) time.sleep(backoff_factor * (2 ^ (retry_counter - 1)) else: raise ex if retry_counter == max_retries: raise Exception('Max DNS lookup attempts hit; connection failed.')` As a side note, you probably want a backoff factor that's less than 1s, given that: &gt; backoff_factor (float) – &gt; A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay). urllib3 will sleep for: &gt; {backoff factor} * (2 ^ ({number of total retries} - 1)) &gt; seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then sleep() will sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, …] between retries. It will never be longer than Retry.BACKOFF_MAX.
The use case is to export the results of a large DB query to S3, without using to much memory. Was that not clear from the article?
Migrating our terraform templating from bash to python 3.7.0. It's been fun and challenging with enough other challenges not related to this to make me really annoyed about not having enough time and focus. Yay for devOPS where the capitalization is somewhat intentional (shortstaffed this week).
Vs code is really nice for python
But why tho? For backup? For additional query?
More attention? It already has quite a lot-- just look at practically every phone on the market. That said I doubt it. Just because AWS has it's own chip doesn't mean that most people will be able to *switch* to it. It opened up a spot in the market, but only for people who were already looking.
I wonder why they made a blog post now. I mean, basically the entire Zen section isn't new and has existed for a while.
Right, but phone applications and server applications are not the same. 
This isn't a place to get your homework done.
I "had" to write a bunch of C# code this year and I have hated every single moment of it. I keep thinking "Why do I HAVE to type all these garbage characters?? Aren't computers supposed to be smarter than this? Arg!". Pretty much every line of code felt that way. &amp;#x200B;
You need to make two 2D arrays. One with all the x values and another with all the y values. x = np.array([range(1000)]*1000) y = x.T Then you use those with the constants and equations you were given to make the Z 2D array. The rest is given to you in the link. 
Thank you! Love stuff like this.
Nice, &amp;#x200B; I'll be checking it out
I don’t think that’s true, cost is a huge reason for organizations to move to a new architecture. Look at the widespread use of Lamba functions, people picked up a whole new paradigm and architecture just because it can be very cheap. 
Youve been telling me about the struggles for the past couple of days I feel ya
Happy Cake Day thecoderkiller! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return.
Wow this actually just made my week! I didn't even know it was cake day!! Woop woop 2 years i think? Thank you for the motivation youre awesome!
Have you read the reviews? The new ARM servers are actually less cost effective than Intel/AMD.
thank you sir for the feedback. actually we recorded Question and there answers/options in the same audio file, so the audio would read out the questions and then all the available options. thanks for correcting the grammar, i will fix it . 
Thanks for your help! I'll try the way you told me👍
Windows 10
vim Jokes aside, Visual Studio Code is pretty awesome (though not strictly Python based) but PyCharm is also decent. Give both a shot, see which you like better! 
Pycharm is probably best 
Thanks!
I haven't tried it out on PyCharm yet but there's also a educational plugin you can download within PyCharm that gives you interactive lessons.
I love Notepad++. No matter what I am coding in.
Spyder4 beta
Will Do!
I'll check it out
I'll take a look
Hi, I'm interested, please check your inbox and let me know
Depends. Do you need to persist data? If not, and if it fits memory: A dict. If you need it to be persistent or it doesn’t fit memory: SQLite. Also, depending on what kind of search you need to perform on the data you might to prefer to use SQLite, even if the data would fit in memory and you don’t need persistence. You could just use an in memory SQLite db if it does fit memory, for increased performance, but storing 60 datasets of this size every minute shouldn’t be a performance issue anyways.
Qt GUIs!
Atom is good too.
I'd think it would be more important to get PyPy3 working well rather than playing around with an exotic niche architecture. 
&gt; Lamba functions It's just.. functions. It's neither a new paradigm nor a new architecture. Just like "the cloud" is modern time share computing, etc. 
I have to do this type of thing call the time. Write out a CSv, JSON, whatever. I wasn’t familiar with smart_open 
I prefer atom but pycharm and viz code maybe better I just don't know or understand all of there feature yet.
/r/learnpython Automate the boring stuff is well-regarded.
As I said in the post, this is for an older man who doesn't surf the web much. You can't gift someone a link to the coursera course on introduction to python, but you can gift them a book. Having done solely online stuff myself I don't know of any good books. But older people like physical things and like reading books.
My bad, I thought I posted this to learnpython. I was rushing out the door.
MS Paint
Hahahahaha!!! Thanks for the laugh! On a related note has anyone used the requests module to scrape data from the website at the end of the internet?
I hope you’re just being a troll. 
This sponsorship doesn't take any resources off pypy3. It might seem paradoxical that "exotic niche architectures" have an easier time attracting funding than features that benefit the whole community, but refusing to work on the former won't help the latter one bit.
There needs to be more of this out there. I think pipenv is a good tool, but it is meant to address specific scenarios/issues. Far too many articles about it seem to be from people who love using a hammer on dry wall screws. 
PyCharm, or if you have money the actual IntelliJ IDE. it’s fantastic. Pretty much no complaints 
Pycharm! If you happen to code in other languages as well, I’d recommend Sublime Text
The problem is I'm not sure what I care about. Can you help me with getting started somewhere. 
I mostly agree with Hynek. My pipenv experience: after using it for several months I gave up on it because of some issues + toxic treatment on GitHub issues by maintainers I have been using poetry in prod for the last 3 months and I really like it. Besides it being way faster and more intuitive than pipenv, I like dev experience without setup.py and how your app is always installed as a packaged when you do `poetry install`

I really like Poetry, but wish there was a way to `--force` | `--skip-lock` install packages. Its dependency resolver is almost "too" good, where mismatched dependencies that would install fine with `pip` (albeit with a warning) Poetry will just refuse installation.
There's a for-loop inside a for-loop. As a rule of thumb, whenever that happens, it's O(n^(2)). If the outer loop goes from 0 to n and for each of those values the inner loop also goes from 0 to n, it'll be n \* n (aka n^(2)) (The actual ranges of both loops doesn't matter; it gets buried under the O notation).

Visual Studio Code is the one I have liked most. pyCharm is very powerful, but a tad overwhelming and also much slower to boot up
Best quote of the day (year) regarding python environments . . . "The following technical opinions are mine alone and if you use them as a weapon to attack people who try to improve the packaging situation you’re objectively a bad person." Evaluate the options and use the one that fits your use case. 
Well, libffi is notorious for being extremely tricky ... of course, you should just be using cffi anyway which doesn't need libffi when you use the "build an extension" mode.

I'll plug my favorite: Wing. https://wingware.com/ It has an excellent debugger, and it's developed in python by a small, responsive team. 
Try using atom with hydrogen ([https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)) and data explorer ([https://atom.io/packages/data-explorer](https://atom.io/packages/data-explorer)) you can get jupyter notebook functionality inside atom
Take a look at [rez](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez). It's an environment manager written in python so it's applicable to a lot of stuff and there is plenty of work to do.
I use pipenv in production and testing to simplify deployment on systems that don't natively support python 3.6+. When it works it is great. When it fails, or when the cli options fight each other and try to be smart but instead for a circular firing squad it is one of the most insanity inducing pieces of software I have ever used. Pipenv release have repeatedly broken CI builds for me for the past 3 months. I was so pissed with how bad it was about 9 months ago that I actually gave up trying to use it on my development machine and learned how to write gentoo ebuilds. On reflection it seems like the perfect tool for python -- if you stay on the happy path and only use it in *BDFL APPROVED* ways then it can be great, be woe to the fool who wanders from the light into madness.
My issue with it is it’s proving really hard to get it working 100% with docker. I’ve abandoned it and gone with poetry
my opinion about pipenv: it do the job in a convenient, better and faster way
What akb60 tells you is correct. However I will add a bit more info. about it. The outermost for-loop goes from (n-1) to 0, that is, the code inside is executed n times. EZPZ so far. The inner loop is a bit trickier because the range changes with each iteration of the outer loop. Let's try expanding the expression a bit. Remember: we're trying to count how many times the innermost block will be executed. fillslot will take the values: (n-1), (n-2), ..., 2, 1, 0 that means that in each iteration the inner loop's range will be: 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1) 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-2) . . . 1, 2, 3 1, 2 1 Now we need to sum all those executions. We can re-write this as: **Σi** for i between 1 and (n-1). This is pretty straight forward, you can use this well known formula: Just replacing the terms, it means that the innermost block is executed {(n-1) \* \[(n-1) + 1\]}/2 times. This is a polynomial of degree 2, which means it belongs to O(n^(2)). &amp;#x200B; I hope you find this helpful! &amp;#x200B;
Recently at work I implemented a Python script to automate some Elasticsearch queries we were doing. The previous method took around 3 hours of developer time to execute (querying with Postman, manually collecting the output, formatting it, then uploading it). With Python, I was able to automate all the querying, collecting, and formatting. I took the process down to 15 minutes total, most of it hands-off. The script itself took around 4-6 hours for me to write from start to finish, mostly due to having to figure out AWS authentication, but the time saved since then has been well worth it, since we were on the hook to run those queries every day for about a month
This is a difficult concept to explain, and the article gives it a try, but actually seems to make the confusion worse almost right away: &gt; Every variable with the type of Tuple\[Dog\] can be safely bound to a value of the type Tuple\[Animal\], but not the other way around This is actually backwards (it's easy to get these concepts mixed up, which is a big part of the challenge), and kind of sets the whole article off on a difficult footing. Scattered grammatical errors and cluttered examples are the enemy here: the goal should be to describe the concept *as briefly as possible*. I feel like the real meat of the topic of this article boils down to: covariant type parameters are types of things you can get *out* of it; contravariant type params are types of things you can *put in*. &gt;In more general terms, anything that takes something— consumer, [sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_%28computing%29), reader, listener, etc. — is contravariant in the type of the objects it takes. It needs to be write-only with regard to the taken objects, though. There! This sentence is excellent. It's 2/3 of the way through the article but it succinctly expresses the concept that is (in my experience) of the greatest confusion to people who encounter it. Building a compact article around seemingly-obvious concepts like this, with a couple of carefully refined examples, would be amazing. The rest of the bulk of the article's can come after, but shouldn't detract from this core idea you want to deliver as clearly as possible. Points for covering Liskov, as well. Maybe even more bonuses for covering Java generics treatment of these concepts (\`T super U\` covariance, \`? super T\` contravariance) and the way the .net CLR doesn't even support contravariance, but that's a choice of audience really.
Thanks to this article I discovered [hatch](https://github.com/ofek/hatch). It looks great; can anyone share their experiences with it?
Could you explain to me how I can configure Python to use cffi instead of libffi? I can't find any configure options regarding cffi.
How about if I want to code on both Windows and Linux? Any cross-platform suggestions?
cffi is instead of ctypes entirely.
&gt; This is actually backwards ... What is backwords? Could you point me to the exact error in this sentence or rephrase it correctly? This article is not succinct on purpose: it tries to explain those concepts to Python programmers (or really to me from a few months ago), who are not familiar with the difference between Java's "super" and "exdends", and were never forced to deal with compiler error caused by using contravariant type as if it was a covariant one, etc. 
Somehow, I still haven't ran into the need for anything else but pip+requirements to handle my needs so I'm not sure what poetry and pipevn aim at fixing. But there must be a problem out there I'm yet to discover. The one pb I would like an easy solution for is automating the virenv activation upon entering a directory. I tried direnv but found it odd that it would actually create a venv rather than merely use the one I already have. I feel old :p

&gt; Reading over the documentation, I'm not convinced that DNS errors are caught by Retry() Hmm, mind linking me to the relevant part of the docs? Thanks for the implementation, I'll try it! Re. the backoff factor, these tests run for 30-60s, and a false negative is way more costly than a test that takes a couple of seconds longer.
Is there a reason you're going with factoring, etc. when there's only 1000 3-digit dividends you have to try? Why not just brute force the solution?
Not elegant
Not a practical problem anyway. Just something I was wondering, and certainly one with practical applications. I have an idea of how it works in my head, and some pseudocode, but when you actually start to put it down... it becomes rather complicated quickly
Several things - One year I worked for a company that had an online store. I wrote a script that sorted and organized out email list. This was just before black Friday. In years past our small company did about 50k in sales. This year the sales went up to 135k. It took me about two hours to write the script. &amp;#x200B; Before I had config management I wrote a script that logged into each system in the office and added or deleted new employee user accounts. &amp;#x200B; At home I wrote a script that read the metadata from all my photos and renamed the files based on the metadata. &amp;#x200B; Before I had a home automation system I wrote scripts to do things with my hue lights. &amp;#x200B; When I worked for a movie company I wrote a backup script searched our movie archive and copied the best quality of video to an external disk for backup. There are tons of other things have done but these are the ones off the top of my head. 
This is what I'm currently fighting with. And yesterday it was a son fight. But I don't know if I'm doing it right. Nevertheless it works. Will edit with code when I'm on my pc 
Fair enough. One way to do it is to loop through the power set of the prime factors, calculate the unused factors, and check that the product of both partitions are 3-digits. However, this is not particularly elegant either.
Try pyproj ([https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)), Python wrapper around Proj.4.
Ok... Maybe r/learnpython is a better place for this? 
Thanks! With this &gt; connect (int) – &gt; &gt; How many connection-related errors to retry on. &gt; &gt; These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote &gt; server, which we assume has not triggered the server to process &gt; the request. I guess it can go either way... I've raised an issue over with the good folks at urllib3. I'll update here if I get some clarification.
You refer to a variable (a name in the code) of type `Tuple[Dog]`, and state that it can always be bound to a *value* (actual data) of type `Tuple[Animal]`, but not vice versa. Unfortunately this is switched: the value `(toucan, rhino, cat)` should not be assigned to a variable which needs to exhibit members that are dogs. If the variable were typed as a `Tuple[Animal]`, it would be fine to assign it the value `(corgi, samoyed, borzoi)` because all of those dogs are animals.

Start by googling "ROT13"
I recently bought a house. When we were looking, I wrote a script to go to a local house listing site, scrape and clean details of each new house using a specific criteria, separately grab the council valuation from a different site, and save in at the bottom of a spreadsheet. This database of houses was pretty valuable over time, especially when you can see some houses getting relisted at lower values, etc. 
they didn't necessarily get in my way, it's just that dealing with tabs is troublesome on mobile and a browser I get when following links from reddit app, for example, doesn't have any tabs at all, so you have to go back to the main article every time and sometimes the position gets lost and you have to scroll and find that place in the article yourself. That's why I had an impression that you would be better off just quoting the parts you linked to (maybe still leaving the links in place in case quotes were not enough for someone to understand and they need to read more of the article).

I'm a software engineer at an engineering R&amp;D place. I a couple years ago I switched to Python for all my new software. It's been going so great that I got a promotion. I also recently started translating some of my bigger projects out of other languages into Python. Here's the part I don't get. You are about to graduate and want to be a developer or db admin but don't know much about either? Huh?
I see. I will think about it, thanks!
Seconding. Please feel free to ping me in case someone replies. For all the lazy lurkers, here is the homepage with docs and an overview of the features: https://pypi.org/project/hatch/
Right, I messed it up. Thanks!
What error? Can you be more explicit about what you expected vs what happened?
Previously it's working, I haven't installed Ghostscript, suddenly it started throwing an exception 
`gs` is Ghostscript and library tries to run it, but fails. Either Ghostscript is not installed, not accessible (check $PATH environment variable) or not functioning. Try to run it manually with arguments used by library and see what happens. 
Cool. The rumors are that Raspbian "Buster" for the Raspberry Pi coming some time in 2019 will have a 64-bit version, and since Python seems to be the preferred language in the Pi community, the ability to speed it up with jit-compilation is welcome.
Great, Would you be able to share the code? 
https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/cookbook/#simple-data-entry-return-values-as-list I used this recipe and edited it to my liking
PyInstaller is such a great tool. Recently discovered the one-file thing and it's amazing to share executables with other people. 
i have got ghostcript installed and the error still persists
Nah, that's not your problem. It's just that GDB is trying to find the sources to display you better diagnostic information, but they aren't where it thinks they should be. But, to make your life easier you could either put them there, or tell GDB where they actually are (if they are accessible in your setup). https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/unix/unixguide/infohtml/gdb/Source-Path.html see this for how to do it.
&gt;[http://dpaste.com/2FMQ2PG](http://dpaste.com/2FMQ2PG) **, got this error** &amp;#x200B;
pyenv does that with a .local file :)
Oh?! Darn, I'll give it a try.
You might have to do some setup so it uses your existing virtual environments, never tried that.
Whilst I agree with your point, I'm not sure what else there is to sanitise?
I'll have a look. Thanks for the tip nonetheless :)
AWS Rekognition is pretty good and a little cheaper per 1k calls, assuming you will go over Sightengines free 2k/month or 500/day limit. (Rekognition $1/1000 pay as you go). If you are new to AWS, you will get 5k calls/month for free.
you can probably use XPATH aswell
r/learnpython is best for this.
Correlation does not mean causation. If the number of car crashes goes down as the number of computers bought goes up, it would be silly to try and come up with a reason of how computers are preventing car crashes. That said, it is a rather interesting graph 😂 I would suggest that in the beginning, if a person was looking at hentai, that same person wasn't looking at python. But as the time progresses, one learns how to look at hentai with python. (I'm interested to know how you came up with an idea to compare the two lol)
The hentai's watchers just stoped watching porn and starting doing python.
Ditto, doh. Have thought it was my best friend and have torn out hair because of it in the same day. Would be nice if it consistently worked. 
&gt; The one pb I would like an easy solution for is automating the virenv activation upon entering a directory. What is the use case that makes this an useful feature? 
The answer is a r/programmerhumor post from a few weeks ago about a certain DeepCreamPy project that de-censors hentai images using python.
When you see cool things like this you wonder what else you're missing 
I haven’t used the age range call but I think it does. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_AgeRange.html
Nice.
Nice.
I looked at the script, shouldnt be that hard to convert to java if im not missing anything
I changed directories and projects many times a day, having to activating the right venv manually is wasted time for me.
i like that if you solve a dependency issue with pipenv and commit the lock file youll be solving it for everyone going forward.
If I have an array of strings (pulled from a CSV file), what's the easiest way to convert to them to decimal? Looking online I've tried variations, such as totalDistance = [Decimal(distance.strip(' "')) for distance in distances]
Thank you for the suggestion. But cross compiling a python module for ARM seems to be tricky either.
It's been a while since I used a Dockerfile, doesn't copying /app again overwrite what's changed ie. Won't it overwrite your pipfile? Btw if you want to add a line of text to a file echo "hello world" &gt;&gt; my_file.txt
I posted first on freelancer, but 2 people gave up to it. You have some free time to give it a try... If there is a success I would like to make a change to script... Sending that info to an email address instead writing them on a .txt
Unless your use case is to start an interactive python REPL, importing something and typing out a lot of commands really fast (i.e. not running a proper program), I'm somewhat at a loss here. What is the actual waste, and what's just lack of understanding of what the tooling actually provide alredy?
Thank you for the info! Actually I don't have the sources on my target and you are right, the path is not the problem. The problem is really within the ctypes module, maybe in combination with my ARM setup. Happy birthday!
Really interesting thought. I'm just going to try this on my work PC so I'll report back any findings :-) &amp;#x200B; And yes. Echo would be better if the root user is activated. But my IT supervisor told me that setting up ip\_forward is a really bad idea... So I have to find more information about that.
I don’t work so much on Python, but it is my language of choice for side or hobby projects. I have done lately couple Flask applications and I still prefer Flask to Node.JS, just as an example. Also, it is a very mature language so it has many things already implemented on libraries. PyGame is a fantastic project to do something fun while using Python. Also, as a business major, you can profit (literally) from automating your work processes, and Python is cool for that as well.
When you already have a Pipfile works as intended. The issue is when starting from scratch.
Not OP but I would not have expected that \`print(list(g2))\` includes the 5. Do you know why that is? My first thought was, maybe tuples are lazily evaluated, but then \`print(list(g1))\` would have given the same output.
As the announcement notes, this is ARM and crossbar.io funding ARMv8 support specifically, it's not money the project can use as it wants. If Armin and Maciej (Baroque) rejected it, they just get nothing.
Python 3.....no reason to stay with 2.....

a bit more detail would be useful to know exactly what to consider when choosing
Sorry guys this was me. I'll get back to work now.
it does, but I have some trouble understanding the difference between the two
Python 3, no contest.
Part of the new Serverless stack: https://thenewstack.io/serverless-architecture-five-design-patterns/ It’s a new paradigm and new architecture design. Lambda was at the core of that.

Well, good thing OP never implied there was any causation between the two, then...

Try https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv Is that what you looking for ?
I would first check that the coordinate reference system of the shapefile you have downloaded is in WGS84. If not you will likely need to reproject it from the current crs being used. Secondly you will want to swap the order to Lon, Lat for the point feature. &amp;#x200B; `point = Point(-115.4629147,55.279864` `with` [`fiona.open`](https://fiona.open)`(canada_shp) as fc:` `for i in fc:` `geom = shape(i["geometry"])` `if point.within(geom) is True:` `print (i["properties"]["PRENAME"])` `else:` `pass` &amp;#x200B; If all goes well should print out Alberta &amp;#x200B;
I believe [this](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy) is to blame.
Maybe it's the third variable problem. Lol. "Third Variable Problem A type of confounding in which a third variable leads to a mistaken causal relationship between two others. For instance, cities with a greater number of churches have a higher crime rate. However, more churches do not lead to more crime, but instead the third variable population leads to both more churches and more crime" 
How about create a set of every number between 100x100 and 999x999. Basically a multiplication table. if number in multiplication_table: # number can be divided by 2 3-digit numbers
They are joining, becoming one.

Where's the error? What do you expect to be different, and why? Slice assignment mutates the list in place, and generator expressions are lazy.

It was Christmas so people didn't google work-related Python so much. That's all.
hahaha yes, I thought about the same
Glad to hear it. A rising tide lifts all boats. +1000 to the wish for great PyPy 3 support; specifically 3.6 with type hints. (I make a (small) monthly contribution to PyPy.)
Can confirm. Been there, done that
As you can see, the gap between programming language and a certain kind of freeform art is getting closer, thanks to *awesome* projects like DeepCreamPy. 
Lolwut 😂
I've been using pipenv for more than 2 year and started using poetry recently. pipenv caused me a lot of problems like [this one](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#dependency-resolution), has a weird api (this might be personal) and is slow (startup and dependencies resolution). So I'm starting to use poetry I'm looking for a project manager that can: - Install any python version (pyenv) - Handle my dependencies with a `.lock` (pipenv, poetry) - Transform my `.lock` in `requirement` if needed (pipenv) - Handle a virtual environment (pipenv, poetry, hatch) - Handle (optional) `.env` like [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) (pipenv) - Has a **sane** API &amp; documentation, this is important to help newcomers (poetry) And can we have a shortcut for the command `pipenv run python {filename.py}` like `pipenv -r {filename.py}` or just `pipenv {filename.py}` and for poetry too. Please ?
Python 3... though I do miss being able to search and replace a junior's use of **range** with **xrange** and instantly have earned my keep for the day.
It was introduced in this sub a while back, so I had a look
Haha that website is amazing dude, very well done! I would guess you've got some other sites too, care to share any more? I published a [reddit word counting tool](http://www.cyber-omelette.com/p/reddit-word-counter.html) this week too and have been wondering about adding some sentiment analysis. The backend is a python Lambda "microservice" on AWS published via the AWS API Gateway. 
All i can see here is that python will become more popular than hentai

As a french, my language has non ASCII character everywhere (é à ö ô ç ...). Having non-ASCII characters is a pain in the ass in python 2, it is a breeze in python 3. The change was so worth it !
I would say Python and C++ are too different to completely understand one if you know the other, you would have to learn both. On the other hand basic concepts and learning the second language in general would probably be easier.
you'll probably learn why you don't want to learn c++
Its actually totally free. I havent been charged a cent. The reason I went this route was because it was both free and used a lot of elements that I already understood.
alias python = python3. That should satisfy your question. 
Thanks for the tip! Ill definitely look into it
There are books, tutorials, services other than Code Academy. If you're just learning to program, you'd be best served starting with something like Python. Once you understand the core of programming, picking up other languages isn't super difficult. C++ is a tricky language to learn, however, because of certain aspects of how it handles memory mostly. You have to worry about details in C++ that you don't have to worry about in Python.
I’m 15, so is there an online course that you would know on c++?
I'm 38, and I'd use a search engine. Well, personally, I'd use a book, because I prefer books to online tutorial. But I'd start searching. C++ is roughly 400 years old. There are *lots* of "get started with C++" tutorials available.
Does anyone has a good comparison between pipenv, poetry and hatch ?
Hmm, I don’t like reading 😆, is there more other languages that’s really good and really used?
Creating a UI for an application I'm working on. Though I've met some problems, one is where the UI freezes while It's searching, does anyone know how to seperate GUI and logic, and possibly give me a quick explanation or a link on how to work on GUI applications :)? Other than that, I'm learning SQL while my python information bot is running 24/7 now, at 50k records of a lot of things. 
Looks like negative correlation
Hi , it's hard to know without seeing the code but trying to group your code logic with good classes and managers will help you for sure. Helper functions to avoid rewriting parameter checks and seperating your code to one file per class would be a good start. Take time to reorganize the code and you'll probably find ways to simplify things or at least make them obvious. Good luck. Cheer
If only we put as much effort into our code as we put into arguing about toolsets. :-)
Producing hentai content?
That's right. The first list is replaced, but the second has its contents modified in place. The generators g1 and g2 are lazy evaluated, so they only read from their respective lists when the generator is accessed. At the time of accessing the generator, it reads from its respective list as it is at the time of accessing the generator, not when it was made
In the background I load a json tree of all 861 videos. That way, once loaded, the website can be brilliantly fast. When the json is loaded, the arrows appear and you can navigate around. The problem is that on slow connections that could take a long time. What I can do is have the server generate the initial page including the arrows. That way you can click right away. It is a bit more complex than that. I could imagine a slow cell phone user clicking away, and repeatedly failing to downlond the JSON. So when he clicks somewhere, I need to use AJAX to grab the new page, replace the body. That way when the JSON Finally loads, I can initilize the single page application and all will be fsat. Thanks for your comment. And that way if your cell phone takes too long to load the json file, no problem. 
I would start with google, but for some reason some people like bing.

You can't search for information yourselve, you seem to only be able to use codeacademy and you don't wanna read. It's time to grow up and realise that knowledge does not find you neither does experience. I suggest you take this opportunity to acquire both by trying, reading and experimenting. Fyi you will not find a more suitable beginner language then python. Also Google sololearn.

If it has not become clear being able to find information for yourself is an important skill in programming. To the point where my team has a specific question where we expect the answer to be “google it” or something similar (and a follow up where we expect stackoverflow). We consider this one of our biggest requirements. Based on this we have hired people with really weak c/c++ skills who have been successful because, while before instituting it we hired great c/c++ coders who used up all of the senior developers time asking questions that could e googled in minutes.

Thanks for this reply, it is very helpful.
It can’t hurt, but this is kind of like reading a Dictionary. You’ll learn all the words, but you won’t learn how to write good prose. It’s better (IMHO) to learn with practical examples that demonstrate real-world usage, so you can understand the proper application and context of each. In terms of words, this means reading books and articles, and writing your own. In terms of code, this means examining source code writing software. You might not use every single method or module, but you’ll learn the language and its proper usage quickly enough, and you can always learn new modules as you need them. I’ve been writing fiction and code for ages. I always keep a dictionary and grammar guide on-hand for fiction, and the Python reference guide for coding. I know English and Python well enough to do what I want with them, but I still look things up frequently so I can be sure to put them to their best use.
I second this. The Best Manuel guide out there for Python.

I started in hs, mostly writing games on my TI-82, don’t let you fool yourself, you have more ability to learn and think now than you ever will again, you just need to assimilate information and learn to think like a programmer, which just takes practice.

I'm using Visual Studio Code when coding on Python. It has a debugger, intellisense, integrated git support and you can further extend it by installing other 3rd party extensions.
It's only been around since July 2018 so you're an early adopter, on the cutting edge, not late to the party. &amp;#x200B;
Also NNN ends and DDD starts. There's definitely going to be spike in hentai.
The point of the blog post was more about controlling your memory footprint while moving data around, not about "why would you want data on S3". But yeah, could be for backup, or as part of some other query pipeline. Or maybe you want to use something like \[AWS Athena\]([https://aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)) to generate business reports. &amp;#x200B; Or maybe you want to use a similar pattern to move data between other sources -- for example, I've used a streaming pattern like this to aggregate time series data and write them back to a DB for further analysis.
Yeah, [smart_open](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) was a great find. Take a look at the source code, and you'll see what I mean when I say that the S3 Multipart Upload API is complicated to use. I'd even thought about opening a PR for smart_open to support DB queries with SQLAlchemy. Maybe when I have some more time :-)

Any video in the context of s tutorial belongs in /r/LearnPython 
I'm currently a computer science major in college. We are taught programming first by learning python. The syntax of the language (how a line of code is written) is a lot easier to pick up and write with python. The concepts and rules you will learn in python are very similar in other programming languages. Using variables, if/else statements, for loops, or creating functions are tools you can learn using python and will continue to use with other programming languages. These might be implemented differently (syntax) but will have the same affect in other languages.
Seems like that article is utter bullshit
Das hast du jetzt nicht gesagt
No, C++ is very complex, deep and brings lots of baggage from oldern times. In short it's complicated and basically the antithesis from the python way of doing things. You might be able to understand the very basics of C++ like loops and functions but you won't be able to go far beyond that.

Maybe it’s a lack of quality hentai being produced. The spike at the start is a major hentai release, and all the hentai-loving pythonistas called in a “sick day” to watch it. Then, having expended all of their ... erm ... hentai energy ... they all went back to work. The decrease in hentai and increase in Python represents the fact that everyone was getting bored with re-watching the videos they already owned, so they were spending progressively less time re-watching the old stuff and more time getting work done. Which means, as soon as another major hentai production is released, the cycle will repeat itself.
Nice.

I've just started practising without prior knowledge in programming. Getting slowly hang of it though. For me [http://www.pythontutor.com/](http://www.pythontutor.com/) has been a great help. When I managed to write my first "program" and it broke down, I had troubles reading the code and figure out what was wrong with it. Pythontutor neatly shows how the code runs so not only it helped out to fix the program it also helped me to understand how the code flows and what is happening exactly. Just my two cents from noob to another. 
Damn, I blew my covers... To ze Flammenwerferpanzerkraftwagen!
That's just one phenomenon on the graph. There's also the decline in searches for hentai while Python is going quite strong and is rising steadily.
The second effect you describe does not appear to be correlated. If you look closely, the increase in python happens after hentai starts to decline. In fact, python doesn't really even change much at all and looks closer to a steady state while hentai clearly declines.

Python3! Python 2.7 will retire in... [https://pythonclock.org/](https://pythonclock.org/) &amp;#x200B;
Hi, Just for future reference "I want to implement Python ..." is not the best way to communicate this. The word "implement" has a slightly different meaning than in casual english usage. For example, if you're in an interview and the interviewer asks "Implement a dictionary in Python", this doesn't mean to USE a dictionary. It means to create your own dictionary hashmap class/type without actually using the built in `dict`. Similarly, if a programmer says "I'm implementing Python", they most likely mean they're writing a new variation of the Python runtime itself like Cython or PyPy. To avoid this ambiguity, it's safer to say "I want to 'EMPLOY' Python and SQL in my life" or "I want to 'USE' Python and SQL in my life" if that is what you actually mean. 
I want to employ Python into my life. I know nothing of the culture in the coding world.
&gt; Running a program inside a particular environment does notrmally not require you to actually activate it first My turn to be puzzled. How do you run something an environment you didn't activate first? I really do apologise we can't seem to understand each other. I really wish I could simply trigger some bash thing that activated a local venv upon entering a directory. That is all really :p
It’s more like these are our 2 favorite hobbies. We’re always watching hentai or writing python.
Sounds about right &gt;async and await are now reserved keywords. https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html
Thanks! Spending it arguing about programming on reddit just as god intended.
/path/to/env/bin/python ... 
Running any pip installed script, eg, `venv/bin/flask` will run exactly as if you'd activated the venv. Fairly sure you can also `venv/bin/pip install ...` and it will do the right thing. And of course you can run your own thing as a script with `venv/bin/python myscript.py`.
I use sololearn, I like the way its constructed with alot of community support. I also do alot of travelling between towns so considering they have a app it works nicely. I am also able to pick up other languages with The app. 
Welp. I think I'm going to give up. There's only so much I can force myself to try to understand and troubleshoot when it comes to programming things. And trying to figure out dependencies for dependencies is where I stop. I also don't necessarily want to install MSYS2 and who knows what else to try to get it running. So yeah. Towel is in. Thanks a lot for the help though novel. maybe one day when I'm not so stupid, I'll try to figure it out with the linux subsystem instead of windows.

You flutter between fullblown projects so many times a day, that acticvating the environment is a problematic amount of time, compared to the actual running and interaction of the project itself? The solution is to install a suitable set of entry points for the full blown project. That way you won't even have to change working directory. Instead you use /path/to/project/env/bin/full --blown. 
My bad, will do next time.

&gt; You flutter between fullblown projects so many times a day, that acticvating the environment is a problematic amount of time, compared to the actual running and interaction of the project itself? Obviously, activating the venv is a minor thing. But I don't think I said it was the highest, most severe issue I had. I merely said I'd love to have a solution for that if I could. This whole thread has become odd. Though I appreciate the patience :p
To the best of my knowledge, the only way the solution you described would be possible is if every shape is defined in the source code. That's unlikely in machine learning, especially at larger scales, but if that's what you have, then you could just write a parser That said you could also profile your code using some standard profiler, and that might do all the work for you. [Here's a stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45202040/memory-profiling-list-comprehension-vs-numpy-array) that address similar issues, and [here is the memory_profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory_profiler/) home page.

Agreed. A bunch of platitudes and completely unsubstantiated claims. It’s not even clear what they attempt to “compare”: The two ecosystems? The Python and JavaScript languages? Some mischmasch in between? If you want to waste 10 minutes, go watch cat videos instead of reading this article.
Nice.
Here is no place to talk no python.
Except for the fact that you probably shouldn't depend on a package like nose. The last version was Jun 2, 2015. The package is totally dead. &gt; Nose has been in maintenance mode for the past several years and will likely cease without a new person/team to take over maintainership. New projects should consider using Nose2, py.test, or just plain unittest/unittest2. https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
Sad day indeed
Sure... it's ideal for putting a nice look into utilities or programs you want to share with other people that are perhaps not as in love with the command line as developers are. &amp;#x200B;
Give it a pretty front end and there could be some value in that
r/dataisbeautiful ? 
Use VS Code with the appropriate python plug ins instead of full blown Visual Studio. 
Your problem boils down to `towerlib` and `artifactmanagerlib` If you search for requests in round 2, you will find: `artifactmanagerlib==1.0.6 requires beautifulsoup4\~=4.6.3, commonutilslib\~=1.0.8, requests\~=2.20.1` `towerlib==2.0.3 requires beautifulsoup4\~=4.6.3, cachetools\~=2.0.1, dateutils\~=0.6.6, requests\~=2.19.1` You will see two dependencies, `requests\~=2.20.1` and `requests\~=2.19.1`. `~=` is very special in pip, [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39590187/in-requirements-txt-what-does-tilde-equals-mean](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39590187/in-requirements-txt-what-does-tilde-equals-mean) Essentially `artifactmanagerlib` is saying I want 2.20.X and towerlib is saying it wants 2.19.X, and pipenv cannot make these dependencies match. Reading and understanding what the different symbols mean are probably your biggest helper getting out of dependency hell. You will see from the last line of your output that pipenv is telling you the dependency constraints it could now solve. `pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure: ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches requests&gt;=2.9.1,~=2.19.1,~=2.20.1` There is a lot going on there so don't worry about missing it, dependency management no matter the language is a living hell.
What correlation? Because of that one bump at the beginning, but then you ignore the smaller bumps along the way? Many things are Loosely correlated, this is why correlation really doesn't mean much on its own

My two biggest beginner mistakes: 1) trying to catch and handle every possible edge case and error. Sometimes you just need to let the thing error out so you know something went wrong 2) not abstracting functions enough and trying to do everything in a jumbled mess of a 500 line function.

Not using list comprehensions! A lot of big loops can be replaced with comprehensions and lambdas :-)
We need to do some research.
You're right! Thanks for pointing that out to me. I updated the post. 
It depends on what else your program is doing but I'd bet you'd be a lot better served with threading. Passing data between processes can be tricky. To make a running average use a `deque`. As a wild guess: from collections import deque from threading import Thread data = deque([], maxlen=500) # or however long you want the running average to be def get_data(): ''' this is the background function ''' while True: weight = magicfunction() # get the weigh data.append(weight) # add it to the deque time.sleep(0.1) t = Thread(target=get_data) t.daemon = True # quit the thread when the program quits t.start() # start the background thread #your normal code print('doing code stuff') time.sleep(10) print('average right now is', sum(data) / len(data)) #etc etc ... --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

I think a lot of it’s location / country specific. Honestly we did a lot of research and ended up just buying the one we fell in love with despite being slightly out of our price range. Here’s the repo if you want some inspiration. It’s not super pretty - for my own use: https://github.com/timbledum/tmscraper
Did you write the program yourself and which language? Yes, you can do this with IPC (interprocess communication), an example of which is pipes. 
Basically i used a python library to handle the weight sensor (hx711py) and it's example code. The program I wrote is also in python 3.x and is mainly a GUI that asks question and gets keyboard inputs. The weight has to be read at some points during the questions. &amp;#x200B;

Using a list as the default value for a keyword argument.

Not using the standard library. Developers who are not familiar with python (especially if they are coming from other languages) will manually write code to perform a function available in the standard library. Writing code to parse CSV for example.

Shared mutable state and it's not even close. Goes for every language I've reviewed professionally, not just Python. Encapsulated state changes are often fine, e.g. for performance optimization within a function/method. But beginners have a really bad habit of passing around big objects with setters and side-effects. It takes just a few weeks for that to devolve into an unruly mess.

Multiple if statements which can abstracted with a function or using a dictionary. Comments which explain everything too much. Not type checking things. Writing functions which are already methods found on the type.
Using too many list comprehensions, nesting them, and creating overall unreadable code "because I can". Point is, use it in moderation. Readability counts.
Even worse, importing huge external libraries (often numpy) to do things that are just as easily available in the standard library or even as builtins.
Defining new classes for everything. Many small jobs can be done by simple functions. ([good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0))

Antitodote: Think about the weird behavior you do want to catch, and name those exception classes specifically. The default behavior is “stop the program and alert the user”. This is probably what you want in most cases. Maybe it’s _what_ you want. Like you have a script that runs constantly, and you want to do some retries in the case of an exception. Use “except Exception”. This will leave out the cases you almost certainly don’t want to catch, like KeyboardInterrupt.
You might get some ideas here: https://pyvideo.org/search.html?q=finance 
It's a rare example of a design flaw in Python. Bare except should be a syntax error, because catching all exceptions is a rare special case - and one that can be requested with `except BaseException`.

Generally the relationship tracks, except early on where the relationship is the inverse. This makes me think that you're looking at changes in general search volume and the initial inverse relationship is spurious.
When I started using Python I was very guilty of this. One of my first production apps was a SOAP client written using the socket lib. I look back 3 years later and ask myself, "really, why did you think this was a good idea?"
Aaaaaa sorry I'm just very frustrated with this 
And when you're there, post your code. 
And you definitely did not pm me that source code and I will certainly not use it.
Well yeah, but the questions was "beginner mistakes". A beginner's mistakes is usually more of big assed loops with extraneous variables. Overusing lambdas and maps and partials is more like an "intermediate mistake". ;-)

starting to code came down my confidence or lack of it. I was so afraid to break things I want willing to experiment. I had encountered this before when I broke my dad's computer when I was younger. he was angry because he didn't know how to fix it either. learning how to come to a safe starting point when everything has fallen apart is a great way to build confidence. virtual machines are helpful but they are their own obstacle. learn how to install your operating system. be ok with starting over.
I don't think it's a design flaw at all. Just don't write bad code. Say you have a service and want to make sure it stays alive so you catch every exception and handle/notify

Hey, the easiest way I found to install PyGTK in Windows (years ago) was with the all-in-one installer. For some time I couldn't find the site that offered the installer any more. But it seems to have come back in [this blog](http://johnstowers.co.nz/2010/12/24/pygtk-all-in-one-installer-for-windows/). Maybe try it out before giving up. That installer (at least the original I used) has everything you need to start working with PyGTK out of the box.
Pretending python is java. Using double-underscored variable names because you want to make things private actually messes up your library because nobody can extend your classes. Just use one underscore; if people want to break their own downstream applications, they can. I would also teach some of the major points of PEP8 at the same time as concepts are taught. Like "this is how you write a function, and also, give it a name in snake case". If you let people fall into bad habits because they don't know any better, don't be surprised if they get upset when you later suggest they change their entire codebase - worst case, you may have just created a developer churning out non-compliant code fucking up the ecosystem for everyone else.
Are you talking basic math operations? Either way, would numpy be preferable sure to speed if doing a lot of math?
Functions are just "blocks" of code. Think of them as instructions that you call to do something like print or return data after processing. def greet(name): print("Hi ", name) # Call function with your name passed as a variable greet('Get_Cuddled') check out r/learnpython For me, I go there and see if I can do someone's homework as a challenge and post "hints" on how to go about things . I'm still learning and started out in VBA. I work harder trying to automate things as it gets boring doing repetitive tasks. Python has helped me speed up my tasks so I can goof off more. The more I practice the more I remember. Coding is coding once you get past the language syntax. If you don't know what to do, use the [docs](https://www.python.org/doc/). Google is your friend too.

I'm completely in favour of powerful IDEs! I'm bracing myself for graduation, when I'll probably be priced out of my glorious jetbrains cocoon, and have spent probably about 6 hours so far trying to give vim even a tiny portion of the features which are a couple of clicks away in the jetbrains toolbox.
PyCharm is 20/month for pro and there's a free version which is fine for 99% of use cases. Most employers will pay for your license. If you want to go vim I respect that, but you got options

Eh, I use CLion and the odd bit of IntelliJ as well: the whole #! is $650/year. It was mainly an exercise to see how it all worked and how much functionality could be replicated because so many people swear by it, but the setup is a whole lot of work and there's half a dozen plugin choices to research for every piece of functionality.
I just started learning Python. I have a little bit of experience in Pascal and JavaScript for schoolwork, but not that much. I received an assignment that involves doing multi line inputs. While in Pascal I can just do readln() multiple times, I can’t seem to get it working with input() / sys.stdin.readlines() on Python. The assignment was given on an online platform with a Python compiler. The platform sends one input with values on different lines to my code and checks whether the output of my code matches the answers saved on the platform. Because of this, I can’t use input() multiple times since only one input is sent. I can’t use sys.std.readlines() either because I cannot ctrl-d to finish the input. How should I change my code so the program works on the platform? 
I’m not exactly sure what you’re trying to say with “equity analysis and evaluation,” but I really like QuantStart’s series on quantitative finance using python. https://www.quantstart.com
Big things that were written in 2.x and can’t just be “switched over” 
I think the recommended way to do setup these days is through `pip`: e.g. `pip install .`, `pip install -e .` for develop/editable.
Your post is much too vague to give you any advice on how to learn, (don’t know how long you’ve been studying, don’t know what you mean by “struggling”, don’t know how you think about things so etc). But what is helpful for me is finding a benchmark. Something you can measure yourself against and see where you actually are weak at and how it compares to others.
I'll give you more info tomorrow. I'm going to bed right now, thank you for offering to help!
I understand the differences between the two. I also understand its not just a matter of upgrading. &amp;#x200B; But thats really only relevant for older projects or projects you have to maintain. Why aren't people upgrading to 3.x for current and future projects?
It would depend on what you’re doing. 
expecting everyone to know your language? lol
I taught myself code (Java) . My references were just free ebooks/video series I found on the web. I overcame the so called "entry barrier" by realizing that programming is just like giving instructions to a computer on how to do things. Start by breaking down the problem into smaller problems, convert these to a pseudocode. I usually write these smaller problems as line comments. Then, with your knowledge of the syntax, convert each step of the pseudocode into real code. If there is a gap between your pseudocode and knowledge of syntax, there are a lot of good free resources out there, you just have to ask the right questions. Shifting to Python was easy for me because the only thing I have to learn was syntax. The problem solving skills I have developed are still applicable. Start by solving coding challenges/problems. Also, you can challenge yourself to create the project you have always wanted to do. I found myself learning concepts a lot faster when they are applied to a project I am really interested to work with. I didn't have to pay anything to learn coding, but now I can make money by coding. (Not a professional programmer tho, still an undergrad working on some small-time projects) Have fun coding!
I almost never use classes in my code. Just functions and calls. Is it bad practice?
I thought the classic example was ice cream sales and drowning deaths. 
I would do a review of the code, but before I do I’m just trying to see what the benefit/use case you had in mind for this?
This is the exact use case that came to mind.
Seems more appropriate as a gist. I would also not agree in how you're setting up python for development. Unless this development environment is for one specific project?
&gt; C++ is roughly 400 years old. This made my night. 
I would highly recommend following these two YouTube channels for learning python. * [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ) * [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g) &amp;#x200B; They both have helped me learn python and made my life so much easier! I found that if one didn't explain something well enough the other channel covered it and they go well together! For just beginning sentdex just created a [new updated playlist for Python beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln). I would also recommend watching [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k&amp;t=0s&amp;list=LLyPgyq-gTsnqR6_Phb_Ek4A&amp;index=2) about how to get into the mindset for programming which is arguably the hardest part. Don't give up! I can share more resources I have found useful if you want, just let me know!
&lt;3 numpy though. We are involved. 
Not using enumerate, fstrings and generators
My rule for list comprehensions is 2 lines (100 cols) at max. More than that and a for loop is more readable.
Who says they aren't switching when they can? There is more to this then you're claiming to understand. If you're a developer in a corporation or industry that relies on modules that haven't been upgraded to support 3.x, your ”newly” assigned project/application/script can't be built under 3.x. You would also have to meet a deadline, so you can't debug 2MM lines of code for what you bid for the job. The Jurassic Park reference was a joke, but it fully applies to this real-life problem. 
I have a GUI application. The whole main module is wrapped around an "except Exception" block that writes a crash log when the app crashes.
What are comprehensions and lambada?
Not necessarily. I mainly use classes: - To store arguments that ever single method would use, instead of passing them in each and every time, and - When I want to use subclassing to override *some* default behaviors while keeping the rest. But most of my code is bare, easy-to-test functions.
I do this occasionally. Argparse is pretty powerful, but sometimes you just want to add one or two parameters to your script, and not make a whole CLI, so just using from sys import argv if '--myparam' in argv: can be pretty effective.
LOL! Nobody gets tired of deciphering extraneous partials! ;-)
good rule! I think I default to the same. Though you might hit three if say the guard clause or return expression should each sit on a line. 
Meh, I just handled KeyboardInterrupt in programs that I wanted to terminate that way. Not a big deal at all and can still be killed easily enough if you know some basic bash.
Thanks for the suggestion. Pytest does look pretty great.
One common case is when your users can’t/won’t update. For example maybe you had to walk non-technical users through the relatively painful process of setting up Python on their machines (obviously it’s not a particularly difficult challenge for a technical user, but getting a complex Python app with dependencies on say QT or getting a compiler running on Windows to build packages is certainly not the ‘double click to install’ that non-technical users are accustomed to - the sort of user that only reluctantly interacts with the command line by exactly copying out what you tell them). They don’t want to spend time going through that whole process again, and certainly not if there is no tangible benefit to them. So you’d have to wait until the costs of switching are justified by the benefit. For our diverse team (consisting of both developers and users), we are only now just hitting that point, because with Python 2 properly reaching EOL we have to support 3, and supporting both 2 and 3 is leading to too much development overhead - which is reflected in increased development cost, so it becomes a *business* decision to switch from 2 to 3
Haaaaave you met [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/#)?
I completely understand why businesses are reluctant to make the switch. I’m asking more from a personal use standpoint. I know quite a few people who use 2.x still. And they just don’t want to switch to 3.x.

Man, I can’t believe how many times I had `list = [ ... whatever ... ]` when I was starting out 
The only time I do a bare `except` is when I log-and-reraise.
When you don't understand a problem, break it down into combinations of smaller and smaller chunks until it looks basically like pseudocode. Figure out how to solve step one, and then solve it. Then solve step two. You don't really get much better at programming by studying, you get better by writing programs. When you're at the level that you can solve a variety of problems in a language, then you can start to worry about doing things "right". But for now, just worry about doing things.
&gt; trying to catch and handle every possible edge case and error. Sometimes you just need to let the thing error out so you know something went wrong This is a super important point to bring up. Under certain conditions, *dying fast* is better than limping along with broken functionality. 
Not exactly a builtin, but I override `time.time` for great profit. Seriously, I can't overstate the amazingness of overriding time to run timing dependent tests on controller code.
I would say the opposite -- I've seen a lot of people import pandas, and then do everything the library was built to do by hand. Want to reduce the runtime of a python program from 4 hours to .15 seconds? dataframe.groupby.
from some_module import *
 a == b or c
Also consider Visual Studio Code! Microsoft makes a Python plugin that gives you autocomplete and it's pretty easy to integrate linting, tests, and auto-formatting too. Way easier in my experience than doing the same thing in vim
Module level variables a.k.a globals.
Important progression: The end of the graph shows that they finally reached the python proficiency level to allow then to split their time 50/50 with hentai porn again.
How is it going?
Ugh no. Pandas is great for data analysis. Please don't pip install pandas and all of its dependencies if all you are doing is importing a csv and doing a group by. import collections, csv group_by_first_row = collections.defaultdict(list) with open(file, 'r') as f: reader = csv.reader(f) for row in reader: group_by_first_row[row[0]].append(row[1]) easy peasy
Neither. It's the 3rd of Dec 2017 to the 12th of Aug 2018.
I think TDD goes a long way towards helping #2. If you can’t unit test the function easily, it’s probably too big.
Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Do they need the added complexity? Do they test it by profiling? Or is the only tool they know because it's what x field do? 
This. Numpy and Pandas are great, but if all you're using it for is importing a csv and doing some simple data tranformations, please take a look at collections and itertools.
The biggest mistake I see regularly is not thinking through the problem but trying to solve the whole problem in one go. Both of which are terrible ideas but together they lead to failure. Think through your entire problem (as much as you can) and work out all the different things that you need to solve (broadly), how you are going to solve them (basically), and lastly what is the easiest and most direct thing to solve. 
Google is your friend
Yes, this is what I wanted. `print(list(g2))` includes the 5. 
It works. Thanks.
True. But the opposite is even worse. Function names shoukd be long enough to understand what the function wants to do
or without `defaultdict`. Marginal gains but this is a python sub... import csv group_by_first_row = {} with open(file, 'r') as f: reader = csv.reader(f) for row in reader: group_by_first_row.setdefault(row[0], []).append(row[1]) But the gains are marginal since you already got rid of pandas.
I was hoping you would be too :-( *lowers head and slinks back into the cold embrace of an uncaring google overlord*

Buy the book 'python the hard way' start reading and working the lessons. Skip reading if it gets boring and just do the lessons. You will be building little projects. Do not try for hours of this a day because you will burn out and quit. Tell yourself 30 minutes a day. You may find yourself going longer and this is because you are interested. When you are having fun you are doing good. If you just can't think and it's not fun any more then stop that day or for a few hours. I often solve issues by googling and thinking about it not in front of a computer on a bus or otherwise. Something will click and you are back at it. Sometime a problem will take days of thinking or trying to solve. We'll, ask for help to save yourself time in bad cases. Yes, your gonna have to study this. Lessons rarely work, but doing it little everyday will get you there. You can do it!

Hey buddy check out this book for really good explanations of intermediate concepts. I think it covers your question. http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/
I'm new to coding and just finished a data science boot camp. During the course our instructors had us pip install pandas, numpy and matplotlib. We mostly used jupyter notebook for all class activities and homework assignments. Which is all set to a python environment. Is pip install worse than other ways like conda install? We started most activities with importing pandas, matplotlib, etc and then importing a csv, creating a data frame then doing basic statistical analyses and graphing. I've noticed it can take time for everything to run properly. So is there a better way to do this? 
I think if you never see those names you must be to new to python (and probably programming in general) . Lambdas are functions without name, and comprensions are ways to make "list like objects from definition", like "the of numbers from 3 to 45". Lambdas are sometimes used in the comprensions. If you feel that you can use some comprensions, go and read. If you ate scratching your head from my bad explanation give it some more time.
For me it was "indentations"
Nope, it's $650/year for organizations. For individuals it's $250 a year. And of course you can pay monthly instead if you don't want to shell out $250 at once. I give Jetbrains $25 a month and I couldn't be happier to do so. Being able to use a Jetbrains IDE for almost all major languages is super worth it to me. Not to mention that the bundle also gives you datagrip, which is great. (Although admittedly dbeaver is also great, and also super free.)
I like camelCase
Raymond Hettinger does some talks which forever changed the way I code. Prior to that I always hated iteration, afterwards I began using it at every possible instance.
[But Wait There's More](https://gist.github.com/eltrhn/01224262b816df21b601ab0784d5f999)
I prefer click but for smaller/simpler use cases it’s not worth adding a 3rd party dependency, so I find its worth being fluent in argparse as well.
Nice list, thank you!
I would advise you to not limit yourself to the few resources you purchased. Explore the internet, watch a random video on functions on YouTube, do some exercises then go back to your primary material.
Type checking is the opposite of duck typing, which is fundamental to the Python philosophy. 
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh shit
My mantra to learning is to get the best of both worlds, paid and free. What I do is purchase a highly rated paid course on a platform of my choice (within my means, of course) and complement it with a bunch of highly rated free tutorials. While I'm going through the paid course, if I come across a concept that gives me a hard time (functions in your case) after going through it twice, I start referring to the sections teaching the same concept in all the free tutorials and e-books I have gathered. Basically, I start bombarding my mind with different tutorials about that particular concept until I finally come across a tutorial that clicks for me and I finally understand the topic. Then I revisit the paid course and it all starts making sense. Summarily, I brute force the concept into my mind. In my case, I was stuck at object oriented programming, and this method is the way I overcame it. Don't stick to a single resource, even if you paid for it.
Not using [decimal](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/decimal.html) when doing simple division or multiplication.
If you want to catch everything, use `except BaseException` which is explicit about the desire to catch signals and such, or `except Exception` to catch all. Explicit is better than implicit.
You need to show the error otherwise we don't know what went wrong. You might not have numpy installed.
Open your terminal, type "pip list", see if "Numpy" appears there. If not, you need to install it.
Not visible on the code itself, but I think very few use virtualenvs for their projects, which is a shame. 
I've been using python pretty heavily for 5 years now and never heard of a comprehension. Definitely going to look into it.
I downloaded anaconda and it came with most of the popular libs
You need to install numpy. Sunce you are getting error while importing itself, you should find a way to install it first!
`for i in range(len(somelist))`
I assume your needs is using SQL syntax on dataframe, isn't it? But my question is why? Pandas already has syntax to get data based on your condition. Check this: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html
2 is by default on every linux machine, new and old 
This. It can creep up on you if the first time you use it as a default argument is in a more complex function. I could have sworn the code was cursed when this happened to me.
/r/learnpython, read the sidebar, post your code formatted for reddit (see "Formatting Help" below) and post the error. Help us help you...
Maybe you're not using anaconda to execute your code but another python
I think you should look for a good video tutorial. 
Automate the boring stuff is becoming outdated with the updates in technologies. Example is the openpyxl module. 
Thanks for reminding me. Although I'm going to do it in Rust I may end up testing algorithms/methods in python. I'm not sure what sort of problems they have.
Quality shitpost
Sentdex is doing great job with his AI series but his code is a mess with a lot of "bad" patterns. 
Always follow the text in "python -m this"

Thank you I will!
Thank you I appreciate it. I am quite new to Python :)
Stupid question... But, can someone tell me what adventofcode is?
He sounds like Will Ferrell. A lot.
Oh, I totally agree -- this case called for it, however. I'm just saying that if you're doing matrix math and import numpy, or using pandas for what it's designed for, you should not be manually looping through the damn arrays.
Thx all of you

From their page: &gt;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
It is a series of events/challenges/puzzles in the spirit of an advent calendar. So from december 1st til the 25th every day a programming challenge.
Let me guess: You mostly deal with ASCII?
Why haven't you switched to breathing CO2 or CH4? Earth will be out of LTS soon, you better get prepared to live on another planet now.
Thanks... Already busy with building some AI projects as well as Project Euler... Otherwise, would have loved to try it out... But, definitely tell my younger sister (CS student) about it..
If you're really a beginner I'd guess that the third and fourth hour of work are extremely unproductive consisting mainly of a blur of trying to remember what's going on in your code and what the heck all these leftover variables are in your environment. Take breaks and start fresh pretty frequently so that you can feel your understanding of the problem improve. Clarity of thought for 10 minutes is almost always worth an hour or two of time away from the computer. It take a pretty advanced set of skills to be able to hammer away at a problem for hours on end. "Up all night writing code" is the modern day version of "image: enhance!"
So, experts in a field don't necessarily make the best teachers, because things are so second nature to them that they'll often gloss over some of them as perfectly intuitive, completely forgetting about the tricksy weirdness they had to wrap their heads around themselves. Im going to have a shot at explaining a couple of things that I think can be stumbling blocks for beginners. **Firstly**, `return` vs `print()`: When goofing around in the console, these two things appear to do exactly the same thing when called via a function. The key difference though, is that a function which ends in a `return` statement returns a value which can be assigned to another variable/name, but a print function does not; it literally just displays the value in the console. So, say you have two functions as follows: def print_hi(): print("Hi!") def return_hi(): return "Hi!" Now if you try to assign the output of `print_hi()` to a variable, eg `hi = print_hi()`, things might seem fine and dandy in that you won't get any errors, though you will notice the "Hi!" is printed to the console immediately, because in assigning the output of the function, the code in the function is executed. But, if you now `print(hi)`, you will see that `None` is displayed on the console. This is because *all* functions which do not end in a return statement default to returning `None`, which is a unique value to essentially indicate there is no value. So assigning the output of `print_hi()` to a variable results in the 'value' `None` being assigned to that variable. From there you should have some intuition about what will happen when assigning the output of `return_hi()`; that variable's value will be "Hi!", and nothing will be printed to the console while assigning it. **Secondly**, local variables: Suppose we want a function that multiplies any number by 2. We might try something like def double(number): number = number * 2 But, this is pretty much completely useless! Because firstly, the variable `number` is entirely *local* to that function, this function doesn't return anything (or rather, it returns `None` by default), and Python function arguments are passed by value. To break that down: a local variable does not exist outside the function. If you called `number` elsewhere in this code, you would get an error saying `number` is not defined. So you certainly couldn't call `double(2)` and then expect `print(number)` to display 4 in the console. It doesn't return anything, so assigning via `n = double(2)` would just assign `None` to n. And since functions are pass-by-value, even assigning `n = 2` then calling `double(n)` wouldn't do anything useful, because as far as the interpreter is concerned this is the same as `double(2)`. So generally, you probably would want to define the function like this: def double(number): return number * 2 ...and when calling the function, you would want to assign it to a variable for use, eg: &gt;&gt;&gt;number = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;doubled = double(number) &gt;&gt;&gt;#let's check &gt;&gt;&gt;print(doubled) 4 As a final point, note that the local variable `number` in the function definition does not cause problems when you assign the *global* variable `number = 2`. This is because local variables exist on the own, and are only used while the function is executing. In some cases this can be considered bad form, and can cause tricksy errors, so be careful, or just avoid doing this. Finally: you should live in r/learnpython. This sub is mostly for experienced/professional Python programmers to have interesting discussions about the state of Python at large, but r/learnpython is specifically for helping people learn the language, and is a very active and helpful community. Loads of experts there to, but they are there to help :)
1. pip install installs the package for the python install if you're not working in a virtualenv. I generally use pipenv to create a virtual environment for whatever application I'm working on and install any needed dependencies into that. 2. Learn what's in the standard library. A lot of the time people import numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. and then proceed to use none of the functionality provided by those libraries. You shouldn't import them unless you're doing some heavy numerical calculations which would be significantly slower in pure python. /u/flipstables complaint is that people import those numerical libraries for everything, and then do something like his example above. my complaint was that when people actually do need those libraries, they tend to import them then do the calculations in pure python.
Well, I learnt something new. In puzzle 2 of day 1: &gt;!For my first naive attempt I just put all the frequency entries in a list and checked if the new frequency was in that list. Took over 2 minutes. I changed the list to a set and it took less than a second.!&lt;
What should you do?
Depends on where you draw the line between beginner and intermediate.
Two possible reasons: 1. They have to work with legacy code so they prefer to do all their code in the same version/style. Having to switch back and forth can be annoying. 2. Stupidity.

&gt; I go back and redo the first 20% just incase I missed something. I am now back into functions and it is only slightly less confusing than before. Without even reading the rest of your post, I have a very optimistic feeling about your future as a software engineer. This is **exactly** how you learn things. "I thought I understood, but I seem to be lost. Let me go back to a place I definitely understood and work forward from there again." We get a lot of posts from people who think "coding" is a get rich quick scheme and want to know how to learn "machine learning" or whatever the fad of the week is so they can rake in the $$$. Yours is one of the few posts where I feel like you are really serious and you are going to end up knowing this stuff for real.
O.o is that like creating on object in the function parameters and keeping its reference alive when we return from the function? Could that vanish in any moment if we don't assign it outside the function?
really helpful！I got it. Thanks again 😄

I tried that (the PY2.7 msi installer) and got the following info when I went to run the program. PS E:\Downloads\Games\kye-1.0-win&gt; python ./kye.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "./kye.py", line 21, in &lt;module&gt; from kye.frame import KFrame File "E:\Downloads\Games\kye-1.0-win\kye\frame.py", line 23, in &lt;module&gt; import gtk File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\gtk\__init__.py", line 30, in &lt;module&gt; import gobject as _gobject File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\gobject\__init__.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt; from glib import spawn_async, idle_add, timeout_add, timeout_add_seconds, \ File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\glib\__init__.py", line 22, in &lt;module&gt; from glib._glib import * ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application. I think I'm just cursed. I likely could get a VM running of XP easier than getting python running. haha If you know what else I could try, I'm welcome too it. But uhhhh, yeah I mean. I don't think it should be this hard. One thing I can say is that gtk-demo doesn't work either. I don't have a gtk entry in my PATH even after installing the bundled installer. 
Import speed also suffers - or is that just pandas?
Serious answer: its a [spurious correlation](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). It doesn't mean anything and there is nothing to explain. There's a billion combinations of random factors you can compare, some of them will correlate purely by coincidence.
Do you have any Camembert?
Think about what can you do with what you know. If you know the basics, try making a calculator, an alarm, an adaptation of a game like rock paper scissors... Just use what you learnt and code like crazy. Eventually, some parts of the code will not work and by trying to understand what did go wrong and fix it, you'll learn a lot. Functions are very useful when you have a lot of code for example. For an easy start , think about what can you do with a piece of code that you can use over and over again without having to write it everytime you want to use it!
"You" don't need to switch over - it's not like you cannot fit two different flavors of a programming language into your mind, or cannot install both toolchains side by side. It's really more about individual codebases, and now the question is "why doesn't anybody rewrite all those python 2 codebases in python 3". And if you phrase it like that, the answer becomes more obvious: because it's a considerable amount of work, with quite some potential roadblocks (not all dependencies work on 3, and replacements usually require adapting the code) for very little gain. In hindsight, I think making python 3 a breaking change across the entire toolchain, and specifically not having a backwards-compatible python 2 mode for python 3, was a mistake; a mistake that, ironically, now locks many codebases into python 2 for reasons that are entirely socio-economical.
My experience with this library and medical statistics data (.xslx tables) said that it is really good and simple to use)

Checking if a specific element is in a list is O(n) because each element is checked one by one for equality. A set is implemented using a hashtable, like a dictionary. In that case, membership checking is O(1) (on average).
Interesting
I'm a teaching assistant at my university and people the most common mistake I see is people hating Python.
As a teacher it'll be misunderstanding syntax at first. Checking if a boolean is true or false for instance. Following that a complete disregard for the DRY principle, no functions or classes and perhaps worst of all no refactoring. In this latter issue, it's when you need to stop, open another file and write the whole thing again in a third of the lines. Finally I'd say lack of testing (doctest ftw!) and version control. 
Project Euler can wait. AoC is most fun right now, between Dec. 1 and Dec. 25.
Too many classes. Classes for everything even when you don't need one.
In my opinion the loops will almost always be better for non-trivial cases. Comprehensions get hard to read very quickly, so you end up formatting it until it basically looks like a loop anyways.
- You’re passing the same object to different functions. - If you’re doing this for just one object, or for a few objects but with different functions, then it’s debatable, but you could probably make it a class. - If many objects follow the same path, or some similar path, use a class. - You’re “passing through” objects. (a(b, c, d) calls e(c, d) but never uses c and d otherwise) - Definitely use a class if it’s more than one parameter or it’s passed through multiple levels. - Otherwise, it’s up to you. The alternative is to write a wrapper “factory” function which is good if the operations don’t really have a single “concept” or it’s literally the one object that needs to go through some steps to be initialized. 
Yes it is. 
My man! This is my absolute number one. I see so many unnecessary classes and class structures that don't make any sense. It's a fucking nightmare to maintain and test. Rule of thumb I give people is put your state and anything directly related to it in a class, that's it.
No that's very good. Many people will start coding and immediately default to using a class, but usually just means you end up with a class that doesn't make any sense.
I agree he might not have the "best" code or patterns, but from a learner standpoint he helped explain a lot of topics at the pace I wanted along with Corey's videos. And sentdex also does a good job of showing "what is possible" with his cool projects for someone who has never coded before.
Ah! We have Camembert, yessir. It's ah... it's a bit runny. Oooooh..! The cat's eaten it.

Download the installer and install it. If you need a package, go to the repository and download it. I used my Anaconda2 to install Python 3.7 as a virtualenv, so I just have one Anaconda install. Anaconda just handles this as any other "package", since their system isn't wheel/egg dependent. You can literally set up Anaconda to install compiled programs. Then, in that environment, I install things like numpy, scipy, etc.
&gt; For reference, I have a 4.0 in college and have never had to study for any class in high school or college this far. Ah, so what you're saying is that you've mostly been coasting up to this point, and now you've encountered a topic where you have to put work into it before you can understand it well. *Good*. Seriously, good for you. It's worth it. It *is* frustrating. That's *good*. That's how you know you're building new skills and dealing with an unfamiliar challenge. You're like somebody who's been naturally fit their whole life suddenly trying to do gymnastics and discovering that you've got to develop muscles you didn't even know existed. The best advice is just to keep at it.
Can you tell me a better way of doing this? Would love you learn! 
If you do not want to use PyQt, but PySide2, how do you do it? The example import PySimpleGUIQt as sg sg.Popup('Hello From PySimpleGUI!', 'This is the shortest GUI program ever!') complains "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'"
You can style a QT app with qss, which is similar to css. You just don’t see a lot of tutorials of people doing that.
I don't expect duck typing from beginners. Beginners don't usually work in teams or large projects.
One useful method is using `enumerate`, e.g. `for idx, value in enumerate(some_list):`
Good point!
`for obj in somelist`
Ohhhh good suggestions thank you!
3-4 hours is spread through the whole day between work and sxhool. Little in morning, lunch, and lot in afternoon. 
Apart from logging I can't really think of a reason to use a bare except. And I can think of a lot of problems it can cause by silently squashing errors and continuing with incorrect state resulting in erroneous output with no warning, or non-localised bug side-effects turning debugging into a murder mystery.
Nope, this is how I setup MY environment for development 
Sorry you're right, I misread the post before me I do use except Exception
Your IDEs should catch `def foo(bar=[]):` but I understand that real code is often more complex than this simple example.
`print "Hello World!"`
Yea that's another use case I have, I have a context manager and a decorator that basically do the same thing Try: Yield Except exception: DiagnosticsLib.exception(..) Raise Or similar version withlike a yield None for full suppress
just wanted to make asynchronous server more easy and flexible for people 
Thank you for the high effort post. It makes a lot of sense and I will read through it again before I start practicing today!
Can you only solve the puzzles for e.q. the 1st on that day only?
Not all languages have lambdas and list comprehensions. C doesn't, and Java didn't until recently.
This post made me feel really good. Thank you for your kind words. 
"Hard to read" is all about familiarity. It's going vary by organisation, depending on the styles they prefer.
Thank you! For the record I was fat and now I'm fit haha. 
The python standard library can't even agree on snake vs camel. Have you used the logging module? It gets worse when you add in externals APIs like pyqt or pyside.
&gt;Django vs Masonite Differences In that article you call Flask "an April Fool's joke". Why the hate?
lol it's not hate it's real. Read the history section https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)
**Flask (web framework)** Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Can you explain what you mean by "not type checking things"?
Oh right, didn't know that, haha. It just came across as rather aggressive in the article :)
When did you start learning python? 
haha whoops :) not intentional
No worries. Don't forget, r/learnpython is your new home :)
Avoiding TypeErrors. This can be done in a number of ways. Just making sure the type entering is the type that is always expected, and if it's not, it's handled in some way.
Okay... Will definitely then check it out...
Your converted it to s string with `" ".join` but you didn't assign it to a variable.
So what should I do I don’t know much python
No one is going to do your homework for you here. There are two basic issues in your code that show you probably didn’t pay attention when the basics of Python were introduced to you. You could look at the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) for the join method to figure out what’s wrong.
How did you assign the list of numbers to the variable `number`?
Why not just use a statically typed language if you're going to do that? The one place I might consider it is at the boundary of an application, where you exchange data with an external component.
My post had 2 separate points in it; the first was about the API design (pretending to be Java), the second was unrelated, and about PEP8. Yes, there's some old code in the standard library. That's kind of what you expect from standard libraries, and it does grate. But I'd rather there be a standard, with a few well-defined exceptions which are documented with an apology, than for it to be thunderdome. The standard library *has* decided on PEP8 - it just can't break the oldest pre-PEP8 API names. All new code should be written to be PEP8 compliant, and the entire community benefits from that happening. On the basis that choosing one way or the other is trivial effort, choosing to write non-compliant code is expending effort in order to harm the community.
Ah yes, you're right, missed that tab!
Interesting, I've never heard of Masonite, thought I knew all the frameworks. How long has this one existed? &amp;#x200B; Using Pyramid as our framework at work. Has anyone done a comparison on Masonite vs Pyramid?
almost 1 year actually. I started it back in December of 2017 as my winter project although it's gotten way more popular since the last 2.0 release since that added a whole bunch of features and and some awesome people joined. As for the comparison of Masonite v Pyramid, no not that I am aware of. Not sure anyone who has joined the [Slack](https://slack.masoniteproject.com) that I am aware of has used it either.
No, you can always go back and do previous day/years.
The right approach depends on wider context. Here is one common way: def function(data=None): if data is None: data = [] data.append(1) return data
[](/s sets are implemented using a hashtable, that enables the program to very often go straight to data in a single step O(1). With putting everything in a list, you were pretty much guaranteed to be O(n). On each frequency change it would have to go through every single entry in the list to check if it matched. That's fine for one-offs, if the list isn't too long. But here it was right in the middle of a tight loop. By the time you get to the first duplicate there were 143,777 entries in the list, each of which had to be checked for equality on every frequency change! There's a reasonable explanation of hash tables here: http://www.sparknotes.com/cs/searching/hashtables/section1/ )
The thing is with most courses is that they do it in a way that makes it misleadingly easy. What you need to do is try to find a problem of your own and solve that with the skills you have. Do it simple and linear at first... Then split it up and do different parts as functions, there do it as classes, etc. The key is to APPLY what you learn so you can take mastery of the material.

Wohooo thanks for reminding me about this!
I am on the Masonite slack (Hi, Joseph!), and I’m currently building a app in pyramid. I feel pyramid and Masonite have two different approaches to developing an app, and I think they’re both great and worth considering. Masonite is more opinionated about it’s included batteries, how you structure your code, and relies on third-party services for some use cases, like websockets and email. It uses dependency injection to connect your code to the service later, giving you the benefit of loose coupling automatically. I think the key summary of Masonite is that it’s opinionated to help you get things done fast, once you understand it, which shouldn’t take long. Pyramid aims to be very flexible and let you define how to create your app. It can use whatever database engine, templating language, or any thing you want. It’s more like a library of very useful Velcro strips that connects the things you want to use and serve them over an network connection. But it’s up to you to keep the loose coupling in your code. And it will allow you to test or reuse every component of your application. A decent summary for pyramid is that it gives you a very stable and performant foundation to build your app your way using the components you want. In my mind, I will be using pyramid to try out some patterns I want to learn, like event sourcing and domain-driven design, so I can understand each component of it. I’m going to use Masonite to create a few websites to see how I can enjoy the decisions it’s made for me and it’s useful tools like `craft` to help me quickly get things done. 
Sounds like you don't have PySide2 installed in a way that PySimpleGUIQt is finding it. Can you run python and do an import manually? &amp;#x200B; c:\python\pycharmprojects&gt;python Python 3.6.2 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Sep 19 2017, 08:03:39) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; import PySide2 &gt;&gt;&gt; It should complete without any errors if you have PySide2 installed. &amp;#x200B; PySimpleGUIQt will first look for PySide2 and if not found will try PyQt5. &amp;#x200B;

Of its the same as mine; Trace back (most recent call last): File”user\...”, line 6, in &lt;module&gt; import cartopy.crs as ccrs ModuleNotFoundErro: No module named ‘cartopy’ Then again im also getting an error on the % symbol in line 1. Any ideas?
I wrapped the text in "&gt;!" and "!&lt;" 
I found it a great way to get better at Rust by solving little puzzles in both Rust and Python. 
That's what I'm hoping. I've been messing around with rust for a while but could do with sitting down and spending time with it. Hopefully this is the motivation needed.
Because we're talking about beginners using Python. Type checking becomes much more important in intermediate and expert levels. 
Just completed my first day puzzles at AoC... It was really fun... Now, here's the question... Should I upload the code directly into GitHub or wait for AoC to finish before doing it??
Let me ask you this, what bitness is your python interpreter? If you don't know run `python` in cmd or powershell. &gt; Python 2.7.15 (v2.7.15:ca079a3ea3, Apr 30 2018, 16:22:17) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 It should output something like this at the top. My python 2.7 interpreter is 32 bit. The part that tells you the bitness is this: `MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)`
Thanks for this info...
OOPS I used WGS84 because I did not read your description with enough care. Use the same setup with D['ellps'] = 'GRS80'. In addition, you can also add D['datum'] = 'NAD83' but I can't see that this makes a difference. this makes a difference.
Always followed the adage, "Solve first, optimize later".... Initially ran the examples and found the correct solution using lists... Then, ran it on the actual input... Found the correct answer.. (I usually allow the program to run for 5-10 minutes to check whether brute force solution provides an answer before terminating it... In this instance, it only took a couple of minutes)... It was very clear that the membership test was the bottleneck since I already stored the complete input as a list of integers and then, first, thought of using dictionaries but then, realized it would just make the code a lot more complicated... Then, realized that I had sets in Python and used it...
/r/learnpython Think about what the `map` function does. Does it change the arguments you pass into it, or does it return a new value? Think about what the `join` method does. Does it change the arguments you pass into it, or does it return a new value? Given the above, do you expect the combination of the two functions to change the `number` variable, or not?

I tried reading the Django vs. Masonite article, but the introduction is very long and then every section goes on too long as well. Can you please make a table with one column for Django, one column for Masonite, and each row being a feature to compare them on? 
The installer is good for one environment. Downloading packages is not good when packages have dependencies. 
Okay, I think I may not know enough about Python. I, as a Python amateur (and also not a programmer), used lists as well. What exactly is the difference between a list and a set? 
That’s a good idea. I can make an article like that tonight
Thanks! I use Django all the time but in reading your article you did point out one thing about it I don't like which is how you start needlessly breaking things into apps and then wind up with more complexity.
I had the same process as you but instead of realizing that I had sets I instead googled how to do fast lookups and landed on sets. 
Yayy 
Can I program in Verilog 
Fstrings are so beautiful
We have a codebases initially written by mathematicians and physicists that had a bunch of `self.a` and `self.l` variables. Aaaaaaaaaaaaagghhh
You can program in anything. The site only asks you the output
I set my PEP8 warnings to light up red in PyCharm like an error. Really helped me write better python code
I'd recommend against using string literals for paths anyway. Use `pathlib`. ```python from pathlib import Path my_path = Path( "C:", "Users", "myself", "Documents", "folder 1", "folder 2", "folder 3", "long named text file.txt" ) with open(my_path, "r") as my_file: do_things_with(my_file) ``` The `Path` object gives you lots of convenience methods too. You can also just split string literals across lines, like this: ```python my_str = ( "my verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry " "long string" ) ``` Note that there is no comma. In my python projects (which tend to be single-use data science things), I often have a `constants` module which includes something like this: ```python from pathlib import Path PACKAGE_ROOT = Path(__file__).absolute().parent PROJECT_ROOT = PACKAGE_ROOT.parent ``` It makes it easier to refer to other things in the repo, like data or test resources. That way I don't have to write in any system-dependent absolute paths, just relative to wherever the project is, but they're all encoded as absolute paths for minimal ambiguity.
Click is really awesome
Unlike me
I’m reading the book automate the boring stuff
"To play, please identify yourself via one of these services:" No thanks.
I'm increasingly migrating my repos so that CI rejects submissions which fail flake8 or `black --check`. I include git hooks to `black`en people's code for them when they commit.
&gt; Okay, how the heck are spoilers supposed to be formatted? I searched and followed the guides but it's just not working I don't even look at formatting guides any more because sites love to change the formatting codes and never update documentation. In fact I got "scolded" on the lastpass forums for pointing out that their tooltips for how to use formatting not only didn't work, but caused the page to reject the submission because the post "looked suspicious". Even after troubleshooting the problem, determining the issue, and attempting to email it to their support email it was rejected by their mail server. Specific reason was "Your email to group support@lastpass.com was rejected due to spam classification". Turns out if I removed the offending part, the part that their own forums specifically told users to use, the email sent just fine. It absolutely blew my mind that they made it so difficult to report actual problems to them. Anyways, that's just my rant and not even the reason I was replying. I just wanted to let you know to ignore guides. Instead when you see a post that is using formatting you want, just click the "view source" link and see what they used to get that formatting. In this case it looks like it was just wrapped like so `&gt;!` hidden stuff `!&lt;` resulting in &gt;! hidden stuff !&lt;
Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it. I didn't realise there was a specific subreddit for learning python, so thanks for linking that too! 
If you want to upload it some where just do it. People who get stuck, want to cheat themselves, are going to find the answers anyway. I'd rather post my answers and hopefully someone can learn something from them, than trying to prevent some random person from cheating on a for-fun site with nothing at stake. The leaderboard is time based anyways so I can't think of a single reason not to publish it.
/r/learnpython You're assigning your iterative variables to `i` and `j`, but you're referring to your axes as `first_index` and `second_index`, which don't change in the same way. You want ```python from itertools import product from matplotlib import pyplot as plt nrows = 3 ncols = 3 fig, ax_arr = plt.subplots(nrows, ncols) for i, j in product(range(nrows), range(ncols)): do_something_with(ax_arr[i, j]) ``` Also, you're assigning to the axis array rather than plotting using it. What you probably want is ```python ax_arr[i, j].plot(some, arguments, here) ``` Also, to write proper code blocks, either do triple backticks before and after, or 4 spaces in front of each line.
Thanks...
So essentially I want to go thru the 4 "for" loops once, print, and then return to the if and go thru the loops again, print, so on until the "if" is no longer true. Is there any way to do this? 
I solved it the same way as you on the first go (and actually just found out about python sets because of this thread), but I was thinking - you could solve this as a line intersection problem, too, right? Because what you've got are a list of numbers each being incremented by [answer to part one] each iteration, which is a bunch of line segments; and since they're all parallel, you're really looking for two identical lines, and then just have to find, of all the sets of identical lines, which one crashes into it's counterpart's line segment first. This is a lot harder to code than set membership, though, so obviously I haven't done it. 
Well... The first thing that we should know that the name 'set' comes because it is a data structure (a way to represent data) which conceptually models the 'Sets' that we have studied in high school mathematics... So, if you are familiar with it, then you know more than 50% of the things that you know, about using sets... I am presenting you with a link which hopefully will clear your doubts in sets... It was initially written for Python 2 but all that is written, is still applicable for Python 3... Since you are not a programmer, I don't want to bore you with things like hashing or mutability, etc... If you have any questions regarding the material covered in link, then you can come back here for answers... [Sets in Python](https://www.python-course.eu/sets_frozensets.php) 
Generally it's hoped that your dependencies don't change that often. What I'd do is [write an `environment.yml`](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment) with all the packages you think you'll need, then creating the actual environment on the other machine with internet. You may then be able to just copy the anaconda directory from the connected machine to the unconnected one, if they're similar enough in terms of OS and so on.
Okay, that's cool, but more easy and flexible vs what? I'm going to start playing around with this now, my only initial thought is that it might be good for a fast QA or development, but might hinder understanding of setting up something for production.
While loop?
The link he posted suggests using if data is None: data = [] But I've always hated how that looks and I prefer Python's pretty single line alternative for setting defaults for unset values. data = data or [] Though this could potentially cause a problem is someone passed `0` or `False` to the function. Usually I don't have issues with that kind of thing when I'm writing code, but if type checking is really necessary I still prefer the single line option. data = [] if data is None else data or data = data if data is not None else [] The vast majority of the time I'm using `data = data or []` though. I think it's clean and clear. Plus I'd probably end up using type hinting anyways so potential incorrect data formats would be caught without mucking up code with a bunch of `is None`, `is not None` checks. So my final code would probably end up looking like this. def function(data: list) -&gt; list: data = data or [] data.append(1) return data
You can do it yourself, but PyCharm also makes it easy to have a virtual environment for your project. It's often good practice to have a virtual environment for your project. If you read up on virtualenv, venv, pipenv, etc you can see more about it. Essentially it's a separate python environment from your system python. It allows you to have different packages and versions of packages installed.
Encapsulate the loops in a function and yield the value. Iterate over that function. 
How would I do that? I'm new to python :(
Gross.
Awesome! That’s why I like this kind of thing so much - you never know what you’ll stumble across!
Erm, I brute forced it in about .1 seconds on my laptop. You might be doing more work than you really need to.
[Lists boil down to arrays under the hood](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity). If you want to know if a given thing a is in the array, in general, you've got to loop over the elements of the array checking to see if each one is equal to a. Potentially this requires checking many of the elements in the array. [Dictionaries boil down to hash tables under the hood.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114830/is-a-python-dictionary-an-example-of-a-hash-table) Details aside, the basic idea is that there is some function that takes in the key, does some magic, and then tells you just where to look to see what the corresponding value is. Lookup is fast (on average), since you don't need to through the whole structure (or a lot of it). [Sets are similar to dicts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3949310/how-is-set-implemented); think of a dict where the values of the key tell you if the key is present in the set or not. (I'm a Python beginner too---happy to be corrected if I messed something up.)
I have no idea what your goal with this code is, but sounds like you want a while loop. "while counter &lt; n:" will keep looping until the condition is false.
The bigger issue is learning how to work at it. Developing skills in math and programming takes time. It's perfectly normal to feel like you are running into brick walls. Keep at it.
You could also hook together some transistors and LEDs!
I'm in line at the DMV. I'll revisit this later today if no one gives a helpful answer. 
Thank You for helping in advance :). I am currently studying Python and wanted to put all I learned into this little assignment but am struggling hard as you can tell lol. So i want to create a random password generator using the ASCII table. The program will generate password according to user input. User input: a: int b: int n: (max number of passwords) The password has a length of 6 values ABxyBA: A: symbol in ASCII table range (35 to 55) B symbol in ASCII table range (64 to 96) x: whole number (1 to a) y: whole number (1 to b) So if the user inputs: a: 2 b: 3 n: 10 He/She should get the following output: \#@11@# $A12A$ %B13B% &amp;C21C&amp; ' D22D' (E23E(| So once a value is obtained from a loop in can't have the same value. Let me know if my explanation is confusing. &amp;#x200B;
Don't hardcode paths. Put them in some configuration file or in your program arguments. Code should know nothing about specific locations, only relative paths. 
Thank you so much for helping me :) 
Conceptually, definitely... But, coding it will be a challenge and I definitely think, it will be a lot slower than using sets... 
Did you use lists??
Yes Thx GIS is interesting actually, I am trying to manipulate lats and lng to see if it is within provinces in a shapefile. 
Take a look at QtDesigner
Thanks for the detailed answer
easy and flexible vs IDK just provide the users all the needed stuff like encryption and handshake I wanted to make this for apps like you send data to the server and then the server doing some prossesing and give you back the results &amp;#x200B; and the parameters like `h` and `d` is what the client need to send like that so the client dosent had to enter the `d` Bcuz the function used the default value if you want to send data in code and not from terminal like that all you need to do is `await client.request('test', h='the paramter for "test"', d='not using the default')` thats how easy it is to add requests and use them if the client want requested an unknown request it want calling a decorator there (to see decorators and their parameters [click here](https://github.com/dsal3389/easyTCP/blob/master/easyTCP/SERVER/backend/server.py))
You could split it like this: path = ("/asdf/foo" "/bar/baz") However the better answer is this: Read the second paragraph of PEP8. A "Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". Needing a string literal to be longer than the line length is a completely valid reason to break the character limit.
Ohhhhh, I have 64 bit python! That would explain gtk complaining about win32 stuff. Is it easy to just uninstall everything from programs and features and start fresh? Or do I have to remove other files somehow? Thanks a lot for the help. 
For my first naive attempt I forgot the list could repeat. I spent as much time as you, thinking that I was doing something wrong with the sums, because I got 1011 different sums, plus 0, and none repeated. :)
The guy who runs this is a genius 
Or. You know. Make a dummy account somewhere for purposes such as this... 
&gt; The installer is good for one environment. Incorrect. Type: conda create --name py37 python=3.7 It'll go download python from Anaconda2. So where is it going? Get that file, move it, and install it. &gt; Downloading packages is not good when packages have dependencies. Why not? You have dependencies. You gotta get 'em somehow. Just go to the web page and download them. How many do you really have? 10? That's 5 minutes. Here it is for windows https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/r/win-64/ Here are the others... https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/ You can also be fancy and collect them through Anaconda by going to the folder. You gotta figure that out if you want to do that.
Shoot, you could be really lazy and install the same version of python on two computers, one of which is connected to the internet. Then copy and replace the folder and the environment variables will be the same.
You may use the typing Optional\[list\] to specify that data can be either None or a list, like def function(data: Optional[list] = None) -&gt; list: data = data or [] data.append(1) return data &amp;#x200B;

I feel like helping you. But I think talking about the problems and demonstrating the solutions are better that writing solution here which you'd have to consume alone again. If you ever need some help over Skype/hangout, DM me. 
No problem :)
It uses a specific version of boost-python to wrap a C API. It's insane. I had to build our docker image on a specific Ubuntu base just to get it to compile.
So I guess this is where I am ignorant. I have preconceived notions of how these environments work. I know I have to activate one or the other, but I thought that when I run that command, it installs it, not just downloads something for me to do withike what you had stated. I wl give it a try tonight.

I might try it using nim and learn something new in the process ... might be too easy in Python. I initially considered rust, but that might be too much of a hassle. 
I used a set. Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/kstrauser/02d82351d4901824caba3107d9ff70ed $ time ./advent2.py Saw 566 twice. ./advent2.py 0.11s user 0.02s system 96% cpu 0.132 total 
Very cool - I love type hinting. But I'm super super familiar with decorators in Python. Could you share an example in your README of using your library?
When I said 'brute force', I meant the solution that I have written used lists which took me a couple of minutes... But, the when I had replaced lists with sets, the program finished successfully in under 0.2 seconds...
OTOH, using standard library, instead of good wrapper (httplib vs requests)
The challenge for today was really fun!
Ok, I think we meant different things by brute force. I meant that I didn’t find (or look for) some shortcut algorithm that was cleverer than just adding up the values one at a time.
Not using VI
Wow, same. 
So hyped! I may try to solve these in another language this year
Well... In my opinion, we did optimise the program by using sets instead of lists/arrays... Knowing which algorithm/data structure to use for a given scenario also counts towards optimisation... One of my mentors at college always used to say that optimisation doesn't mean showing off how much work you could do in the fewest lines of code... But, optimisation means making the code more efficient for both humans and computers.... For the computers, it means reducing time/memory efficiency.... While for humans, it means writing code which is readable and can be easily understood by others... He might be a strict one but I have never forgotten what he told me about coding... He was my Compiler Design professor at University...
&gt; Always followed the adage, "Solve first, optimize later".... Initially ran the examples and found the correct solution using lists... Absolutely true. OTOH, I sometimes optimize early when the edit-&gt;run-&gt;debug cycle takes too long. This is definitely a case of that. Also, for the very common case of "keep track of what you've seen/done so far", I now know to use sets (or dictionaries) instead of lists. That's not even an "optimization" it's just...a good idea.
Yeah, that was a little off-putting. Why can't I just use an email addr? Or even nothing? I'll keep track of my own progress, just check my answer for me.

What is wrong with this though
I modified your program and printed out the results of each operation.

It means that you installed requests package into the different python environment, not the one you are running script with. 
Wrong Python version?
To avoid problems with different environments I recommend running your projects and dependency installation inside VirtualEnv. More information here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
how do I know that
A few days late, but I would be really interested if you could share you experience, as much as you would like. I just got an intern position, where I am to develop an automated selenium test framework for the companys internal GUIs/frontend, and ideally get it integrated into their CD/CI (Jenkins) pipeline. It would be very helpful to hear your experience
Please post here how do you run script and run pip. Also output of commands `which python` and `which pip`. If you are not running virtualenv - I strongly recommend use it. 
You can't use your email address, because then there's more work in keeping it secure. You can't use nothing, because the input is different for each player.
Hi I run the script through pycharm. I have virtualenv installed. python 3.7, newest pip 18.1
This looks fun, thanks
I made a password manager. Just a small project I worked on that started as a class project, then turned into something I did during my freetime. If you wanna look at it, [here's](https://github.com/CookieCutlery/CookieManager) the GitHub, but really just stick to Dashlane for an actual password manager.
Lack of thought out architecture or planning. On the one hand, it's nice: it shows a certain amount of enthusiasm. But as everyone knows, it's a horror to work with, and wouldn't have happened if the author had just relaxed, gone for a walk, meditated on what they wanted to do and sketched something out with pen and paper before beginning typing. Not that that's the only way to code, it's just generally good advice.
Are you running script via Run button? Which python interpreter is selected in Run -&gt; Edit Configurations? 
Or itertools.groupby if you're sorted.
For these types of challenges, especially in the early rounds when things are easy, I find it a lot of fun to come up with a straightforward solution (like set membership mentioned here) and then find a 'clever' solution if I can. For this challenge, for example, I got (second the 'clever' solution): Repeat attempt 0: 83173 in 22871874ns Repeat attempt 1: 83173 in 5727568ns
From pycharm, navigate to settings, project, project interpreter, and try installing requests there. Like this: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2018.3/py_install_packages.png
Yes, that was the problem. Installing PySide2 with pip failed, so PySide2 was not installed and I did not notice that install error. Since there were no precompiled binaries in the usual place, I ended up downloading the installer directly from qt (which only works after you give them your email) After installing, the example above works.
/r/learnpython piss off
Sorry I put this in the wrong place but you didn’t have to be rude
Searching in list has O(n) cost while in set it's O(1). That's why. 
Awesome... you should be able to copy and paste Cookbook programs (most should work with no or minor sizing changes). Or run the Qt Demo applications. &amp;#x200B;

Not necessarily code-related, but I'm a volunteer for the PSF as an organizer of [Startup Row for PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2019/startuprow/) and am excited to host a pitch event in NYC on Tuesday evening (12/4) at Giphy HQ. Tickets are available [on Eventbrite](https://giphypsf.eventbrite.com?discount=nypython) and are free if you use the link. I know it's short notice, but if you have a startup that has 15 or fewer people on the team, has been around for &lt;= 2.5 years, uses Python, *and* you'd like to give a 5 minute pitch at the event on Tuesday, DM me. We already have several confirmed companies but would love to have more. If you're not in NYC or don't want to pitch in person, no sweat. You can apply to Startup Row through the PyCon website too via the first link in this post.
Headless Chrome and [prerender](https://github.com/bosondata/chrome-prerender) if you just need to render the page and then extract some information. 
Definitely agreed... I guess, as we gain experience, we instinctively start using techniques which we know works better.... Since, I usually don't use sets... It took me a while before the thought of using it came to my mind...
So I joined the company recently, +-3 months ago, came in with limited automation knowledge but played around heavily with python for fun in my free time. The head of my department tasked me with automating a couple of smaller web products they had, his previous experience in automation was small amounts but in Java several years ago (according to him) Definitely the biggest pro we saw with Python was the speed in which you can get a semblance of a test framework up and running. And how fast the smaller scripts were. Its interaction with Jenkins was also very seamless, pure cli (i'm totally new to jenkins btw) and had zero to no hitches, we recently got a 2nd automation engineer in and he only does java. We discovered quickly how 'heavy' java is. Lots of harnessing, dependancies etc. So it boiled down to what we need to use and we came to the following conclusion: Java works for big sets of tests and heavy loads, Python was great for the smaller speedy scripts. I'm STILL advocating for Python only but the head of the department is happy with the split as is.
Look into using keys rather than passwords so they aren't sitting in a plain text file on the computer. It might not be important and have very little chance of being broken into, but it's good to always practice security so you don't get sloppy.

I don’t agree. Excessive type checking is a common beginner code smell. As mentioned in other posts, excessive attempts at handling errors is another beginner anti pattern, and this includes trying to catch and re-raise TypeErrors everywhere.

Old friend of mine had me check out [page objects](https://page-objects.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for the structure of the code. As for the reporting, I was using pytest-html but recently found [allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) which is just miles better for a good visualisation of the tests.
JSON is very machine-readable, not very human-readable - for example, you can't include comments to make it easier for non-coders to understand. INI is extremely human-readable, but doesn't have a specification so is a terrible idea. The configparser library is old and kind of gross too. YAML is very human-readable, but the spec is 80 pages long, and as such any library wanting to implement the entire spec is big and complex. It's also insecure because it can execute arbitrary code. TOML is practically as almost human-readable as YAML, and in simple cases, INI, but much more machine-readable. The python `toml` library is small and modern and turns the file into a dict, just like JSON does. TOML is very much in the future of the python language (see [pyproject.toml](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#other-file-formats)) and very popular in other modern projects, like rust. I recommend TOML.
Neat 
Wow this is awesome stuff! Cant wait to dive into this. Do you have any tips and tricks, general advice or stuff to avoid? Much appreciated
If you're just scraping a page which needs to run some javascript, and don't need to interact with the page at all, Kenneth Reitz (developer of `requests`) has been at it again with [requests-html](https://html.python-requests.org/). I haven't given it a go myself but requests has given me enough trust to recommend it.
I'm still very much a newbie with it, but I found out 2 things very quickly: * write re-usable code and be clever about it (i.e. it can be edited, debugged and modularised easily and with little after effects) * make 100% sure your stuff is readable for future you and anyone else reading it
I had not realised the difference was that drastic.
"why don't you switch?" Why do you care?
Don't. Everyone hates getting calls like that.

It is with soup but you could also do it with requests o think
Oh god, this. Have a colleague at work who won't leave a 4 line function be - he must add a class to contain this function. Talking about ego tripping. :/
It’s likely possible to just buy a list - if you want to scrape the data, the first step will be finding a site to scrape it from. Also, it sounds like you work for idiots, you might start looking for new work, as there’s obviously no future for your current employer. If you need to process webpages, I’d start with the Requests module; once you’ve got a local copy of the URL in question, then you’d use a parser like Beautiful Soup to look through it in a structured way. I think it’s pretty unlikely you’ll get very good data this way; or that you’ll get any significant uptake from sending unsolicited/unwelcome E-mails.
Lxml, I converted an existing scraper to using it (I was using selenium to interact with the page, then scrape from a particular site) I fixed it to work by modifying the URL query. 10* speed boost Vs graphical chrome using selenium

I don’t want to be super-negative, but Python packaging is a huge (and frustrating!!) subject, so if you’re just going to skim the surface level like this, it doesn’t really do anyone good because there’s not enough explanation here to be practically useful. You need to go into a lot more depth before you can tell someone “read this and you’ll have a good intro into how to handle Python dependencies.”

You might want to check out r/LearnPython. But I think this might be a kind of interesting question due it's subject matter (though that's just, like, my opinion). # Advice you didn't ask for So first some points about experiments. DO NOT RERUN YOUR PROGRAM ON THE FULL DATA DURING INITIAL DEVELOPMENT When you have slow running code with a bunch of data accidentally running slow things for debugging purposes can be a massive time-sync. There are a bunch of ways that you can work around this - and you will likely be able to think of them yourself, but identifying this as an important factor is a good start. Work arounds include: * Sampling and running on that * Running a particular data set * Reducing the number of iterations etc Also unit tests might be one approach. Though I would suggest developing a *pragmatic* relationship with unittests for this application (e.g. not necessarily testing everything - maybe making your tests of - maybe using consistency tests rather than unittests). PYTHON THREADS SUCK USE MULTIPROCESSING MAYBE USE NUMPY OR CYTHON (or friends numba, pypy) TO MAKE YOUR CODE FASTER USE A PROFILER TO SPEED UP YOUR CODE Don't just rerun your whole data set and be like "that's kind of slow" FIGHT YOUR BOREDOM AND LAZINESS BY MAKING REPETITVE THINGS EASY # What you actually care about With that out of the way lets talk about what you asked. There are a bunch of commercial computer solutions. Like loads. EC2 will give you computers you can use. You can rent computers with a bunch of cores. Getting a single big computer with a load of cores would probably be the easiest approach because it avoids a whole bunch of tedious automation. These look like reasonable choices https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/ I think you can rent these by the hour so if you wanted to throw money at the problem you could get a 72-core computer and do 72 times as much work (assuming you have 72 things running in parralel). ---- Alternatively there are a bunch of services that are "easier to use" (i.e. no sysadmin or linux). I don't think the sysadmin related to these tasks is particularly large, and your application sounds like it is quite short lived - so that's not a problem. If you don't know sysadmin that's an issue. PythonAnywhere comes to mind here (disclosure: I know a number of the employees of pythonanywhere personally and worked for a company run by their current CEO some 10 years ago). 
This is rad as hell!

Any sort of thing you don't want to go down unless you explicitly tell it to will use a bare except.

I still want my thing to keep running, though. I'll log the errors and fix them later, then push an updated version and have a few seconds of downtime instead of hours or days.

Ummm...it works and until very recently, my boss' biggest complaint was that he has to update all his scripts to put stupid parentheses around his prints. I tell him he's right, but that as far as important things go, that's pretty trivial. We're supposedly updating to Python 3.x soon because PyBind11 is that useful and because numpy, scipy, and matplotlib have/are killing their Python 2.7 support by the end of the year. All my code is 2/3 compatible and has been since 2015. You learn that stuff by running an open source library, even though it's not my primary version. When you stick your head in the sand for 6 years, you suddenly don't know what the pitfalls are when you're forced to update. We were supposed to have a meeting so I could tell them what the stupid pitfalls are, but management feels that they can figure it out, so they cancelled the meeting. They think they know better...
If you deal with just ASCII, then everything just works.
Well, I don't know the reasoning. You could ask [him](/u/topaz2078), I suppose.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Hello! AoC creator here. I don't want to maintain a second dataset / progress tracker / input system / user type / etc just for people who don't want to authenticate. Running AoC already takes up several whole months of my life each year, so I try to keep it as simple as possible for me to maintain. Authenticating via Reddit sends me no more information than is already public, and Reddit tells you as much before you confirm authentication. I don't get secret nefarious access to your account. Authentication lets me protect myself from abuse from individual users and lets me vary the experience by user to make it difficult for someone to copy everything on the site, discourage people from making some kind of "master list of AoC answers", and so on.

It's cool, but can you do it with a projection-based viewport rather than orthographic?
Error seems to indicate line 114 not commented out. I don't know if leaving window classes hanging around if ok (especially if you're generating lots of them), but it worked fine when I tested without line 114.
scrape webpages using Regular Expressions
is this perspective projection or orthographic projection?
Basic as hell, but I’m working on a map that plots all the countries I’ve been to. Plan is to have it as a background on a monitor with a countdown to the next travel. Nothing fancy but it’s getting me used to plotting. 
You can use run_in_executor for this without worries. It is like file IO is implemented in trio and curio. I prefer to use existing well tested libraries this way over asyncio re-implementations.
It looks like line 114 is not commented out, but my above suggestion is silly. It seems like you need to modify the on_destroy callback in some way. Removing Shell_NotifyIcon(NIM_DELETE, nid) will leave the very last notification in the tray. Not sure how to keep all notifications there.
Sorry for the noob question. I would love to give this a try as I am looking for a simple way to do GUI's with python but after installing with pip I can't seem to import PySimpleGUI in pycharm community version. It says "no module named PySimpleGUI" , I can run the PySimpleGUI.main() in jupiter notebook after importing and it works so the installation worked. What am I doing wrong?
Good for you! Keep going and have fun! :)
Ok now make Doom
Like, from .txt? You will need the module random. Import it, then open your file with: a = open ('yourfile.txt').read().splitlines() Randomize with: b = random.choice(a)
Double vertical resolution by using .|’|; (and spaces for background). Don’t use unicode for even higher resolution. Keep the old school retro charm. 
Yo what
Just to make it clear for me. So if you have to click something to get the data , you are back to selenium right? Im just asking because i want to see the bus arrivals on a certain busstop on a german public transport site. Right now i use selenium to open this url https://fgi.nvv.de/ Click on "Abfahrten" (german for departure), enter the bus Stop name (for example kassel rathaus) hit "suchen" (search) and then scrape the result list of transportlines for data. Is it possible to do this with requests-html or any other faster way? The transport company doesnt over an api.
&gt;Beyond that, it's just pretty generic programming stuff. Good thing they're not writing it in Go, then!
Nice! Do checkout my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfbRQVAzI1ZkGwYXs7VJVw I make python project tutorials :)
``` A = [] for i in range(len(X)): A.append(do_something_with(X[i]) ``` Instead of `A=[do_something_with(x) for x in X]` To be fair, the first example does not include any mistakes. But in the second example it is much more clear what you want: A list of results doing something with xs from X. 
It's so clean, python can be beautiful...
