Just get [miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or use the official installer... If you do either those, it will be very painless, you would already have pip, and yes you could "just start coding". Since you are wanting to use a bespoke non-installation, configuring things is much more painful. If you are using cygwin you could just install cygwin's own `python3` and `python3-pip` packages. Or you could just search for "portable python" which leads to [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/#portable) which claims to do everything you want (set itself up in one directory, not do any normal installation)
The government will do anything to hide the fact that Earth is flat...

I'm trying to learn Python. Seriously never done any programming, only the worlds simplest bash-scripts (I am very much a humanities kinda person). I decided that I would go through one entire training book ("invent games with python" from Nostarch Press) during this week, starting yesterday, learning whatever I could and one page at a time. So far got a quarter in and I know now about a gazillion times more about it than I knew monday. My plan is that by tuesday next week I should be through as much as possible of this book and add notes as I go.
It is worth pointing out that unfortunately Qt is not an application framework. It's a widget toolkit with basic application framework capabilities bolted on. It's very verbose and its MVC is close to non-existent. The only application framework I know is traits/traitsui/pyface from Enthought, which is powerful but has a steep learning curve, especially when things go wrong. There's a dramatic lack of an effective and well designed desktop application framework in the python community.
Everyone in the know knows that Earth is in fact a Torus
&gt; [print("{} | {}".format(i, 3*i-2)) for i in [2,10,6,4,-3,-10,100]] You will get a lot of unnecessary `None`s. Make the comprehension inside the print function and join the result with `\n` seperator. ```print('\n'.join([f"{i:3d} | {3*i-2:3d}" for i in [2,10,6,4,-3,-10,100]]))``` 
Your logfile URL is broken, but I found it by looking at the directories on your github. The first error is 0x80070643, so I suggest that this is your first port of call: https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-error-0x80070643-on-windows/
Don't you test your images before releasing them to prod?
In fact I do agree with you that desktop application framework for Python is a black hole of disappointments. And more common Q is "why do you want to do GUI on Python" instead of "how to do it in proper way". But still some people use all they can
This is what I do as well, and it's practically painless aside from occasionally having to clear docker caches during local testing

 [Kivy](https://kivy.org) is cross-platform and easy to use. Sadly, too few people know about it.
Program Arcade Games is fucking brilliant, was the first tutorial that really hooked me and got me excited as a beginner. Horribly overlooked/underrated in my opinion. - all content offered in full in both text and video form - excellent and *varied* range of 'assessment' for each chapter, from multiple choice through to mini-projects to shore up your knowledge as you go. - you get to play with making pictures and animations and video games while you learn all the fundamentals Python and programming!
It is because the embeddable package (the zip you downloaded) is not supposed to support pip: "Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer alongside the embedded distribution. Using pip to manage dependencies as for a regular Python installation is not supported with this distribution, though with some care it may be possible to include and use pip for automatic updates ", see [https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package)
does it have "drag and drop" ?

yes, the documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Drag-and-Drop-Widgets)

Qt a widget toolkit? I don't know about pyqt, but I've used Qt in c++ for multiple different things apart from widgets, like networking so I don't know what your talking about
Yes, by using [Event dispatcher](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.event.html) and [Properties](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.properties.html) (nothing do to with python property).
Thanks mate :)
That would end up being 3 spaces between firstname and lastname.
Thanks for being so awesome Mr.Sweigart! 
It *is* a widget toolkit, and a whole lot more besides. To call it *just* a widget toolkit is doing it a great disservice.

You can set a variable named `query` using fstrings
As someone who writes a lot of C++ apps with Qt, I completely disagree. Modern Qt is actually a very useful framework for far more than widgets. It offers nice, consistent, cross platform abstractions over sockets, files, threads, peripherals, sql and more. The first class support for async io is also fantastic.
 &gt;I did not download any .exe installer, only a fool would use an installer. "Why can't I get Python to work?!?" 
In the recent PSF study pretty much nobody used sublime text; probably for a good reason. Supply them with VS Code or pycharm
NO YOU FUCKING DON'T DO THAT. This is how SQLInjection happens. Most DB modules have a method to do it safely
ThankYou for Share Keep up Good Work!
And now you know, that you should use version pinning.
Thanks for taking the time to put this together. Much appreciated. &amp;#x200B;
Wow! Very cool! Thanks for letting us know about it. 
I always liked Qt, but lately I started using flask to build browser apps and make them look like native. It is cross platform and easier to code.
Learning kivy was literally painful. I gave it up after a week. The documentation is a 0.
Some days ago I did something with PYQT for a class in the university... It was a simple GUI app made with python Please check it out if you look for some other examples https://gitlab.com/edurbrito/pyqt_to-do-app 
Not tremendously helpful.
Thanks I'll look into that. I did some research into the error before as I saw it on the 2nd error message, but hadn't come across this website's explanation.
&gt; Qt a widget toolkit? What did you smoke? Have you used Qt like ever? 15 years and counting. &gt; And signal-slot makes it less verbose than many other frameworks You obviously have never used anything beyond Qt. 
pysimplegui is a newcomer but quite useful. There is also QT for Python (pyside2) which I see people describe as better than PyQT5 but I haven't found out why yet
No data binding. Poor declarative UI capabilities. Very poor application framework capabilities. No support for plugin support, enhanced layouting, update capabilities, undo/redo.
That's observer and validation, not data binding. Can you create a declarative UI and point it to a model property so that they keep synchronized?
you can simulate keyboard inputs with the "keyboard" module but don't know for controllers
Why doesn’t anyone use sublime text? Did the study mention? I find the interface pretty approachable.
I didnt found issues in Pyside2. Check github/Aens for a working pyside app that I’m creating. I only use python and it works great
It was in there yes and I don't know why nobody uses it, I've never tried it. if you want to have a look a search for "jetbrains PSF Python Developer survey 2019" or something should bring it up. The two top were pycharm professional, then VS Code and then pycharm community or something like that
Technically you are right, but most of those functionalities are rarely used when you work with python, as python has alternative and generally better support for those. From sql access to multithreading to string handling. When you use PyQt, the main use case in python is for its UI capabilities.

```cursor.execute("INSERT INTO dbo.table1(id, [Product name], Price, Manufacturer, [Product type], [Product amount]) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", (field1, field2, field3, field4, field5, field6)) cnxn.commit() ``` Use "?" as placeholder in your query string, and pass the tuple of values to `cursor.execute()` that are going to replace the ? placeholders. That is pretty much the standard behaviour of any SQL database libs out there. It's injection-safe. Anyway, pyodbc has a short and nice [wiki](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Cursor#executesql-parameters) where all the interface is explained
Electron.JS with SocketIO and Python is what I'm working on now. Electron uses Chromium, so the app can be identical to our web apps, using same css and html. 
Thank you for this! Have been looking at creating a Python GUI for my program just for aesthetics and exploring GUI development as an unnecessary side project.
In my experience, if you use PyQt for its widgets it is best to also use it for everything else. Yes, you can use Python sockets for networking but every time you have to wait for a socket you're blocking the user interface. So it's best to also use PyQt's sockets, because they have an API that doesn't block the UI.

So it's best to also use PyQt's sockets, because they have an API that doesn't block the UI. This works if you have full control of your application and your application is totally self-contained and all your developers agree on using exclusively Qt for everything. In no circumstance during my professional life I found this to occur.
yes

I don't remember. You'd need to ask my past self from ~5 years ago :P Anyway, at this point, I have tens of `.ve` directories and even added a rule to my backup software to skip these directories.
Does anyone use Python for desktop apps? The lack of threading API and the dependency system would turn me off.
First thing that came up on Google... https://pypi.org/project/inputs/
Plenty of people use python for desktop apps. Imagine you have to control hardware for industrial machinery and testing. Do you expect to do it with flask? &gt; The lack of threading API import threading? import multiprocessing? import concurrent.futures? &gt; and the dependency system would turn me off. I don't understand this. Create a venv with pipenv, or use anaconda or edm.

You have no used any other framework in python then or gtk or Java FX or.... or you are delirious
Im go talk about myself, i like sublime but i find pycharm super more helpful with running my code, i usually press play and done, also i can use the interpreter right there, managing my databases right there for me is pretty useful. But it depends in the coder and they preferred tools, also vim for me is quicker for simple scripts
How kemosabe?
Electron is fun and does the job in my opinion, but you can start a war about it... https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7p7s8q/electron_is_cancer/ 
Please tell me. Can you do declarative data binding or do you have support for undo/redo in Qt? 
He deleted his comment and i am curious to know what he said
Please tell me, can you do declarative data binding with Qt? 
I beg to disagree. I use both Sublimetext and VS code (at the same time). Avoid Pycharm (much too heavy).
Aren't these threading features only available in python 3? Most libraries are built for python 2. 
I agree. For example, I'm currently writing a pastejacker using Qt's QClipboard class because I couldn't find anything else that gave me this degree of control over the system clipboard. And it's not even a GUI tool.
What’s the license?
Thanks ;)
An implementation of mergesort. So its supposed to run the mergesort function with different filenames and output to a log file. things like how long it took, what the filename is ...
yes &amp;#x200B;
Geez, so many dependencies. None of it ended up working for me at the end. With PyQt, I was able to get something working on my Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android pretty simple with a test run. With Kivy, it all just broke down somewhere.
I like writing complex queries. I love making views on the DB and having them as unmanaged models in django. It gives me the freedom to tweak my queries in Postgres to know that I am getting the read performance I care about, without trying to make Django ORM perform miracles. 
After some research, you're right!
....but you get a neat Pong game out of the ordeal...
came here to say this. Web-based UIs are way better to work with in Python in my experience and allow more powerful features than the desktop alternatives. 
What did your instructor say when you asked them?
This might be more suited for /r/learnpython. /u/julsmanbr is right: `dict.values` returns an `Iterable`, not an `Iterator`. An `Iterable` can be passed to `iter`, which then returns an `Iterator`. An `Iterator` can be passed to `next`, which returns the next value or raises a `StopIteration` exception. In general, if an iterable can't be iterated over more than once, it's also an iterator and its `__iter__` is implemented as `return self`.
Thanks!!
Cool! I hope you like it
I don't like pycharm either, I'm a VSCode guy myself. I just think that introducing people to the most commonly used thing is a good idea because they'll probably have an easier time finding help online

Using said OP should use f-strings to build his query
I feel like desktop apps feels old, sure it depends on the application but web apps are the way to go nowadays done everybody pretty much has a browser
Wow thank you so much I’ll definitely use that instead!!!!
I’ll take the bullet... Python is terrible for GUI applications. Use the right tool for the job. 
It's the appropriate place for questions like these. 
I'm working on an open source Telegram bot that returns you all kind of crypto-currency related stuff. Basically everything you need to know about a specific coin. Bot at Telegram: @OpenCryptoBot Source at GitHub: [https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot](https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot) Website: [https://endogen.github.io/OpenCryptoBot](https://endogen.github.io/OpenCryptoBot/) &amp;#x200B;
I think I NOW prefer the look of web technology based GUIs like ElectronJS for desktop GUIs. I guess it just depends on the application, but I feel the typical form GUI looks like QT, Windows WPF, etc just look out dated. UWP does look modern, but it seems dead to everyone. I think there’s also a similar Web technology GUI framework for Rust, just like ElectronJS. I think JS is where it’s at, I want to learn it. 
it's also possible to do something, err, different. i've been working recently on a project where the textual data is displayed in a TUI based on urwid (python lib that wraps curses, kinda) and with graphics via either jupyter or a standalone bokeh server. it's "unconventional" but it works for my use case. so don't be afraid to try something else.
MIT
I'd also like a bit more info on this. How to you have users launch the app? How do you hide that it is a browser. Do you have any tutorials that you followed that you could post? I've seen a bit using electron but have never tried any. It looked overly complicated and if something went wrong I imagine debugging would be hell.
It's a little mathy to use, but I've had some success with positional audio using this https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs-python/
with wath tools?

Hot damn switching between a dark and pure white background over and over seems like a terrible choice.

Legacy python is sunsetting in less than 1 year. Most major things have been ported out of legacy python. Legacy python cannot be the reason why something cannot be done in modern python.
Threading and multiprocessing have been in Python 2 for at least 10 years. 
r/learnpython 
That did not help
&gt; Furthermore I can't think of a single person who truly enjoys the node_modules system. I enjoy PHP's `vendor` system via the `composer` tool. It's actually one of the nicest language package management systems I've used.
If the dataset fits in memory, presumably as a list of lines, I can't think of a better way than using the sort() method on that list with an appropriate key function to extract the desired sort key. If the dataset doesn't fit in memory, you'll have to resort to external sorting. You could use sqlite for that (using the sqlite3 module in the standard library). * Create a new sqlite database file * Read your large text file line by line, inserting each line in the sqlite database * Maybe best create an index on the 'count' field * Query the database with ORDER BY the 'count' field, iterating over the result and writing a line to the output file for every row.
There are 1 million things you can test. You are going to have to narrow the list down a lot.
Yes. Google stuff. The Weka Java library is what ive used in the past
thank you, i couldn't find anything on this online.

Kivy is impossible to use easily. The documentation is so convoluted and the lexicon they choose to use makes little sense outside of the Kivy ecosystem..
At this point, are you joking right? You don't need it because you have QML
Kivy is good, especially for touchscreen applications. I wrote a nice Raspberry Pi application that read barcodes and interfaced with an ERP system to track inventory. There's a pretty sharp learning curve, but once I got into it I was really able to get a lot done. I was able to develop on a Linux box in PyCharm and simply move the source over to the RPi.
People might like to consider [https://dabodev.com/](https://dabodev.com/) for the future. It's taken a back seat in recent years owing to its dependency on wxpython which itself wasn't ported to Python 3, but work is now being done which should make available within a month or three.
It requires effort on your part. 
I can see this being generated with openCV, but maybe there is a better way.
I have worked extensively with Python+GTK and Java+EclipseRPC. Did not find Python to be worse for GUI development, quite the opposite as there is no compile step.

I'm learning python right now, is there anyway to save this tutorial for when I get these concepts later? Also new to reddit. Much appreciated, anyone who can help
I have zero experience in this area, but the bar is low enough here that I will bite. Do you think using turtle with asyncio might be possible?
Dude, run away from that piece of crap. Noone is gonna use an app which bundles whole browser core and after a day consumes 1gig of ram. I have a lot of experiences and even the electron "run everywhere" is great idea the reality is horrible.
Why noone mentioned GTK? I remember times where Qt and GTK were the goes. What happend?

Oh hell no that’s really dangerous 
Not OP but helpful thank you
Ever seen Avengers: Infinity War or the latest Star Wars? Python made quite a bit of that... well, Python being used to drive the action of dedicated libraries and tools that handled the actual drawing to screen. Same thing here, only _much_ simpler... look into **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. You use Python to do the math, you tell them to draw the visualization. So, yes.
it's a good idea
This is the sub for learning python: /r/learnpython But asking people to do homework is frowned upon. 
This looks very interesting but is very light on information. Has anyone used it?
It blows my mind how few people know about Kivy. It’s super easy to use and looks great.

I'll also agree with you. People don't like to admit that python also requires either a python install or a effectively something that just hides a python install for deployment. This means most of the things you make probably aren't really meant for most end-users anyway, so they don't need a GUI. I mean, that shouldn't discourage anyone. You can still make anything. It's just a little more bootlegged than I'd like it to be is all. 
I'm right there with you. Right now, it's very possible to build your entire front end in Javascript and use a Python backend now. Projects like [cefpython](https://pypi.org/project/cefpython3/) are really easy to integrate and allow you the best of both worlds.

Qt is a good choice. Along this line, would anyone be interested in a packaging tutorial for this one? I can do one in Snappy, it is a fairly easy to use packaging format and you can charge for apps on the store if you want.

Looking for Python developers to take a direct hire role in Rochester, NY. Let me know if you’re interested. 
I think there is an rlang subreddit. People who learn R are more likely to Python than the other way around. Actaully that's why I learned Python. It's been a while since I've had a reason to use R, though, so I dont think I'd be much help. 
I recommend you both look into quasar framework. It has multiple outputs, including electron. https://quasar-framework.org/guide/ I've got it on my roadmap to put it behind CEFpython to make a web-to-desktop transition eventually.
I'll take the real bullet: Python is terrible for any remotely big project. 
Man, I used Kivy for an intern project a few years back. It was very interesting and it worked, but damn sorting through the documentation was a pain. There were several times I had to dive into the source to find what I wanted. I feel like it could be a REALLY great platform with better documentation and some more development.

It was never a specific question about how to do something in the Python language, which is why I posted my question here. It seemed like a more general Python question, so I deemed it more appropriate for this subreddit over learnpython, since my original question is not about the details of the language itself. I was simply wondering if anyone had any ideas as to why I couldn't install Python on my new PC, nothing more than that. I am sure you would do the same thing in my position.
I do. Learning about the community is part of learning about the language and ecosystem.
As somebody who is mainly using Python+Gtk I also particularly recommend https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html 
Qt eclipsed GTK is what happened. GTK is stuck in the world of C as opposed to C++ and people aren't using C to write desktop applications anymore.

Having spent over a decade working in Delphi, which was designed solely for creating desktop applications.... ...Python is awesome and there's nothing wrong with using it for desktop applications (or most other types). All the advantages of Python apply to desktop applications as much as any other type of application. What makes Python terrible for GUI applications to you? Do you feel desktop applications need pointers and template metaprogramming languages?
.NET applications need the right version of .NET, Java applications need the right version of Java... this doesn't stop them from being very popular tools for desktop applications. It's 2019; we're not distributing on floppy disks anymore. It's not difficult to deploy a Python application.

Attention, irony. So you want to use JavaScript like the GNOME people?
That's interesting. Could you elaborate?
Yes it is possible. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
And how should one go about achieving this?
Who wants to write all that HTML tag jibberish and deal with Javascript? Humans don't think in tags. With desktop apps you visually design a form, which is sane and normal and the way we did it for 20 years. How are web apps more powerful than desktop apps when they're sandboxed in a browser? When there's a web app that can partition your hard drive, let me know.
Everyone knows about it, but it doesn't design standard interfaces, so it's not really useful for desktop applications, only games.
You can get Python QT apps running on Android?!? 
That's a good opportunity for someone who is looking to make open source contributions.
Although you can make QT or WPF applications look modern. In wpf you can use components, like those developed by MahApps , that provide great styles. You can check out some screenshots of the UI components on their github page!
QT has features for everything from audio and video to its own database access ORM. It is indeed an application framework. I come from Delphi, whose entire claim to fame is its (now cross-platform) desktop application framework, and QT is more full-featured than either Delphi's old (VCL) or new (Firemonkey) frameworks.

People use Python for almost everything. For instance the most popular e-book management program, Calibre, is a Python-QT application. There's also the Eric Python IDE which is itself written in Python and QT.

What are you trying to build?
Python 2 will vanish next year. 359 of the 360 most popular Python libraries work on Python 3. Major libraries such as Pandas took a pledge to end work on Python 2 versions a year early. "But all the libraries I want only work on Python 2!" hasn't been true for several years now. There's no need for anyone to develop new software in Python 2 anymore.
OP is obsessed with Enthought's weird UI library which is like Haskell for UIs. 
thanks for changing your tone. it's not about rules so much as etiquette. people that come here are interested in python itself, libraries, news, changes, interesting projects, etc. subscribers here already know python. if how-to questions were lumped in, they would litter up the subreddit pretty quickly making it more difficult to find information we're interested in good luck to you

1. Android interfaces are built using XML tag gibberish. Just because you don't know the correct way to design templates using tags doesn't mean it's an inferior technology. See IntelliJ Idea, Dreamweaver, etc. for examples of how to "not think it tags" if it's that big of a deal. 2. JavaScript is very powerful for building visualizations and handling basic user I/O and interfacing with your python server. It's stupid easy to use if we're being honest. 3. you can write a web app to partition your hard drive pretty easily... write the python code that does it (you'd need this for your GUI app anyway). Write an endpoint using flask that fires the method. Make an HTML page that sends the request to the end point using some JS when a form is filled. Web apps are just GUIs that connect to an external server. It's the same paradigm used for desktop applications, just expressed differently. In this case, your web app functions as a desktop application, but within the container of Python and a browser. 
Build the front end in html/css/js to be hosted in electron and the back end in python as a web service. the js would use web calls to the back end. 
I get that but i want the whole project to be in pycharm
&gt; [...] Took me a while until I found the notebooks with the example output... Yes, I am working on the documentation. Prysm does a very large number of things and this is a pretty one-man-band effort - plus I do have a day job... v0.15, due probably in mid march should improve test coverage a lot and the docs. Most of the examples are probably broken since the API has changed a lot in the last year or so, and the examples haven't been updated. &gt; First step, they could run my calculations again. How do they know which version of prysm did I use? They ask me... Now, how do I know which version of Prysm did I use? print(prysm.__version__, numpy.__version__, scipy.__version__) That won't work for prysm until v0.15 where I used pkg_resources for that... slow progress with time. &gt; What if I started working on a different project and I updated Prysm for that project... Was that before or after I calculated the things for the paper. Were there any changes? If "prysm" is "aquic's scientific code" that's a really hard, shitty problem without an easy solution. In an ideal world you would code fervently for a while, freeze and tag, then do all of the work with that version so it's reproducible. The workflow of research (or engineering) usually involves parallel improvement of the code and its usage. Perhaps the solution is to add a year to the duration of projects and theses? :) &gt; What about Prysm dependencies? Do I need to check all possible combinations? On the dev branch, I have already removed requirements.txt, since it ends up being platform-specific. Packaging is not so deterministic, unfortunately. The only optional dependencies that don't add features to prysm are just performance 'optimizations' that don't change the output beyond floating point roundoffs. &gt; How do I know which one I installed two years ago when working in a different lab? This all can change any time. The brackets are just directives to pip to add more requirements to the installation (for numba, cupy, etc). They don't change the code of prysm, though they do trivially change some internal code paths. If you pip install prysm but already had numba for your own stuff, that's equivalent to pip install prysm[cpu+]. Or if you install numba later -- same effect. &gt; give future scientists the possibility to replicate my software environment. How though? Zip up the sites-packages folder? If they have a different architecture all the C extensions will break. Requirements.txt? Broken for a different OS. List of verisons of primary dependencies to compile on their own machine? How to guarantee they use the same compiler and flag for it? What if I compile numpy with LLVM and you do it with gcc? How about someone using the GCC on yum (I think 6.x) and someone else using the one on apt (I think 8.x)? I'm not anti venv, but I think the tipping point of effort vs repeatable is just a listing of the versions of the key packages used.
*Every* UI option deals with markup of some kind... but you can "visually" design any of them too, if you prefer. 
Qt is pretty flexible when it comes to looks. You can use css to customize every little detail of your app.
What's the problem with having the whole project in pycharm?
Thank you for having a "how does this compare to pipsi" section!
You're right, but those are things people probably have. Or at least the expectation is blunted. Also, getting the runtimes for those are pretty straightforward. Distributing python desktop apps is obviously doable, but it isn't quite as straightforward. 
Yeah, based upon your journey so far I'm not so sure the users using the official installer are the fools. 
Nothing at all. Im trying to achieve that but idk how
Same here. I hate javascript with a fiery passion. People told me I would "learn to enjoy it" after ES6, but it's a load of BS. I hate client side development and I loathe that more and more logic is happening there.

There is an issue with pinning versions like this. Distro developers (Debian maintainers, OpenBSD porters etc.) will take your requirements.txt and wonder why you need this *exact* version. It may not even be packaged in their distro. I feel like "pypi-simple&gt;=0.4.0,&lt;1.0.0" is much better. It clearly states that we need features that appeared in 0.4.0, and t hat we want to make sure not to get 1.y.z since a new major version might break the API. Why does everyone feel the need to pin versions like this?
You can do anything python can do with flask. You’d tie a button on the GUI to a python script or function. I bet you can even call c++ scripts to python buttons

Is there a free-tier? The Website has no information without registering. 
wxPython is now pip installable and can also be installed with conda, so installing it is not difficult at all. I will say that Linux is slightly more complicated with pip because of some of the dependencies it needs, but even that is pretty straight-forward.
Yes - there is a free tier
Why does this question keep getting asked for python? I almost never see it come on on java, c++ and JS forums.
A great list, thanks for sharing.
Of course you can, using the ctypes module and some exported c++ functions in a dll file. 
Which means that just maybe a node modules like system isn't ideal and the proposal (PEP 582) should be shot by firing squad before it enters the building.
To be fair it isn't that difficult to creare the same modification. Default to working directory (because of interactive mode). If a script argument exists, read it and fetch the parent.
Forget developers backs, imagine security engineers backs. Sure if it gets to the point that you can write files to the disk you probably have bigger problems already, but in theory you can now play the long con. Write to pypackages (which usually will have less protection than a system wide or venv site/dist-packages directory), then be lucky when your fake package gets imported.

Pyinstaller can bundle to one exe but have issues with hidden imports. For testing I prefer to use clean virtual machine, because sometimes it tries to use libraries from venv and of course it won't work on machine without Python. Qt is more advanced, but don't forget about size of package.
IMO pinned versions are appropriate for requirements.txt files, while biggest possible version ranges are suitable for setup.py/pyproject.toml files. The strict versioning is helpful for development, and fine for a git checkout where you're probably using a venv. My question is what this project offers over pip-tools.

Write your PySimpleGUI code one time and switch between tkinter, Qt, WxPython and web browser by changing the import statement.
That's debatable, depending on the context. I've written many web-based applications, and a few desktop GUI ones as well. The browser gives you a powerful platform, but you have to learn to use Javascript, HTML, CSS and HTTP effectively. That's a much steeper learning curve than any graphics toolkit. On top of that, you're often hamstrung by security restrictions and cross-browser support issues. Web apps make a lot of sense in a lot of situations, but I gotta admit I breathe a sigh of relief when I can just do a GUI app instead. Its amazing how much simpler frontend-backend communication becomes when it doesn't involve two languages and isn't crunched into text serialization over HTTP.
This is a great article both in terms of format and content. Are you planning on doing a similar thing with other concepts?
&gt; Why does everyone feel the need to pin versions like this? Deterministic builds. Usually if you have an application you'll want pinned versions within it. But if you're releasing a publicly shared python package, use wide dependency version ranges that it'll function with. 
Because the point of a `requirements.txt` is to produce a batteries-included, reproducible development environment. It has nothing to do with the downstream users, who will never see it or be affected by it. The `setup.py` enumerates the minimal production requirements, which can have soft version constraints, be separated out into a number of extras. 
I know the function that's make a circle

It is a user acceptance thing. The people I would make it for are not very technical and if they saw a browser they would think it is online and the data would be exposed. You could explain until you are blue in the face and they still wouldn't get it.

So I have a stupid question- I have a command line python tool used extensively by engineers(not Developers) The tool runs a bunch of preset configurations and outputs some data files which the engineers then play around with. This is done repeatedly while changing a few parameters here and there. I am looking for something that can run python scripts with variable command line arguments and easy for a person to rerun previously run tests. I can build one from scratch but it’s not worth the effort. If there is something I can use that does even 50% of what I need - I will be happy. Anyone know of such a thing ? 
So you are supposed to keep a list of pinned requirements in requirements.txt, and a list of the same requirements (non-pinned) un setup.py/setup.cfg? Basically, duplicating the list? Also, someone mentionned "pyproject.toml" files. is there any place where upstream CPython devs in charge of packaging development issues keep an up-to-date about what a package should look like?

Yeah, that's far more work than you should have to do. #3 is just silly. no, all those steps are not "easy". It's as if programming has regressive over the last few decades. 
If I do "i", it just prints the first 4 elements, which in this case would be fine, but if the elements were out of order it wouldn't be the same output

It's good for devs but terrible for users since Electron apps use heaps of cpu and memory and almost always fail to do standard things like accessibility, native look and feel, drag and drop, etc. properly compared to native toolkits.
Oh I see. Thank you|
How the hell do you open QT Designer?? You kinda skim that part..
And the right tool is...? (Assume I only want to build one cross-platform app).
Iftt with code 8-) thks
If you mean the numbers out of order, using i will just print any number less than 5 regarding of its location What is the output you want, the first 5 elements in the array or the lowest 5 elements in the array regardless of their position ? 
Nevermind, looks like it's from pyqt5-tools and is run via designer command.
&gt; So you are supposed to keep a list of pinned requirements in requirements.txt, and a list of the same requirements (non-pinned) un setup.py/setup.cfg? Basically, duplicating the list? Yes. But the requirements file will include all of your optional dependencies, test/format/lint tools. Note that if you're distributing a standalone executable which doesn't have to play nice with anything else in the environment, pinned versions are fine. &gt; Also, someone mentionned "pyproject.toml" files. is there any place where upstream CPython devs in charge of packaging development issues keep an up-to-date about what a package should look like? There is a place (the python packaging authority, PyPA), but the docs are inconsistent and outdated. `pyproject.toml` is a work in progress which is used differently by different tools, and AFAIK not at all by pip. 
Interesting.
Just invite them to try accessing "http://localhost:1234" or whatever from another machine.

A week I guess. About halfway or more through automate the boring stuff I wrote a few programs to scrape some data from websites that I wanted to store for later analysis. I understand python on a close to intermediate level now id say and I’ve been really practicing and learning for maybe 3 weeks. In that week though I didn’t do anything other than read and practice for 10-12 hours a day.

I am still very new to python, but my only guess would to possibly be a machine learning algorithm. Now i don't know if machine learning is a language or if its a concept that can be applied to programming languages. So lets apply the super hero concept. The machine learning concept would need to detect for symbols on the person's chest to distinguish them as a super hero. 
You could easily create something in tkinter where the entry fields (or drop down menus with prefilled in choices) just fill in a string, and you use the os module to run them on the command line. I wouldn't use this approach if I was having to support production software to the larger organization, but some engineers should be fine. 
Threading isn't as easy in python as it is in other languages- so if you don't know what you are doing your GUI will become unresponsive very easily. However, with languages like c# you can easily write responsive GUI's. That said, you can pry my python from my cold dead hands.
Coming from R, Python is absolutely slick for GUIs. PySimpleGUI is a dream.
It’s supporting about 100 people and growing. I also need a history of commands run and store some output. So just a simple Tkinter or other GUI drop down won’t work in the long run 
That almost sounds like you are at the level of getting a sw dev involved instead of trying to hack something together yourself. Good luck.
Haha yes. I was hoping for an open source project that achieves something similar. I would have thought a lot of people face similar issues. My previous company had an internal solution for this. But at my new office we are much smaller team. 
TBH I wouldn't. I'd use .NET on windows or some other compiled language on OSX (Linux I'd run screaming).
&gt; if how-to questions were lumped in Man, what would it be like if this sub were full of questions which should be posted at /r/learnpython? I guess we'll never know. /s
I would like nothing more than to ban all Web-based apps from my system. Electron and it's ilk are an abomination.
Yeah, fuck Web UIs with a rusty spork. I don't need two messenger applications and Spotify eating hundreds of megabytes of RAM in addition to my actual web browser stealing a ton. And they don't even conform to the host OS's UI conventions or support other features that the native frameworks have. One of the best parts of the Mac OS, historically, is consistency. Things all fit with the overall theme and use the same widgets, they have functionality they derive from Cocoa that you can count on being in every app...then someone like Spotify comes along and fucks it all up with a clunky dumpster full of flaming feces that doesn't fit in.
The old Spotify client was Qt, and every Web-based one since has been a massive regression. Dragging and dropping songs between playlists felt as smooth and natural as reordering files...and now it's a slow and frustrating experience.
He discussed this in a podcast years ago that I listened to recently. He said it actually helped his business as a lot of people who viewed the books online also bought hard copies. I'm one of those; I have a hard copy but find it easier to have the online version up on another screen when I'm coding.
I *strongly* encourage you to avoid the temptation to use tkinter. Yes, it means you don't need external dependencies. But it has a ton of crazy problems that no GUI library should have, and finding workarounds to these problems is a nightmare. Use anything else.
Great resource, thanks!
Today, built a CLI tool to quickly upload and share self-destructing file links via [file.io](https://file.io) [https://github.com/rhgrieve/fastball](https://github.com/rhgrieve/fastball)
While I love your tutorial and recommendations, I’ve always found a browser based UI to be better, even if local.
There's sort of an art side of 3d and a programming side. Much of the art side required almost zero programming knowledge, although 3d is extremely technical whether it requires programming or not.

In easy words, you were trying to use array element value as an index which leads to error because your array lenght was shorter than the index where you were trying to find value.
For really large projects, it can be quite common. Excluding blank and comment lines, TensorFlow has 670k LOC of Python in 3.2k files, and 860k LOC of C++ in 3.8k files right now.
Sorry, I won't have access to the internet on the computer I'm trying to put it on. Thank you for the heads up on the challenge.
It doesn't appear to be script-friendly. It is possible to script mouse-control, but I don't know how hard it is.

Me2 - I'm reading a book called *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way* by Zed A. Shaw. One thing that he says over and over again is to never copy pasta. I couldn't agree with that sentiment more. Always write the entire thing. It helps you gain practice.
Also check out f-strings if you’re in python 3.6 or above. They are fast and more readable. `print(f”...{x[0]}...”)` It makes a lot easier to read if you can use them.

Awesome, thanks for the second opinion! At the moment I'm calling the process and it actually allows me to input a file into like this: subprocess.call(['C:\Program Files (x86)\Spek\Spek.exe', fp]) Where fp is the filepath. I'm now using pyautogui to input hotkeys to do it for me! I think I should get it to work!! Thank for the help though!
I really enjoy using this library so far, I recently discovered it myself. I like being able to quickly run analyses to try and create (or at least visualize) the optimal portfolio. One question I have is this, should I have any security concerns with using this library on my personal machine? Assuming I don't leave my login information just hanging out in a script, what (security) risks to my RH account are there, if any? It's a question I should've asked myself before playing around with the module, but better late than never! 
If anyone else wants to see how it was solved: def grab(): print('Please import filepath for batch-process.') filepath = input() return filepath def main(): #Grab Filepath for Batch Processing filepath = grab() #Loop through all files in directory for root, dir, files, in os.walk(filepath): for file in files: #Find File Path of Song (need to not hard code) fp = filepath +'\\' + str(file) print('Processing: ', fp) #Call Spek with that filepath subprocess.Popen(['C:\Program Files (x86)\Spek\Spek.exe', fp]) time.sleep(2) #Move Mouse to use Spek GUI pyautogui.FAIL_SAFE = True pyautogui.PAUSE = 1 #pyautogui.moveTo(661, 1064) #Location of Spek on toolbar #pyautogui.click() pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 's') pyautogui.press('enter') pyautogui.hotkey('alt', 'f4') 
As of now I'm working on a dynamic class system in a text-based adventure game I'm making, using health, speed, etc. I'm trying to make it very similar to Pokemon's combat system.

I dunno. I found Qt threads alright to work with.
Kind of a necropost my dude, also this was just a joke
Thanks! It looks great and I'm looking forward to seeing how you put it together.
I would say it's pretty common. Think about combining all those libs, in multiple domains plus tests. It only takes a few scipy sized libs to hit a million local I've worked on code bases where I've contributed multiple projects in the tens of thousands of lines of code. It only takes a few more people like that to hit a code base that is a million lines of code.
A simple text based adventure. Just started learning python too!
I posted this in the wrong forum and was told to post it here, so I did.

This is sad: &gt; five days where everyone at Dropbox puts aside their daily responsibilities to work in small, fast-moving teams to tackle exciting or interesting problems. It suggests that everyone's daily responsibilities are working on large, slow-moving teams to tackle boring or uninteresting problems.

Quick question. Finding elements by tags or classes is possible but you have to first "form" the html "tree" structure in order to find the nested instances? Otherwise it'll only return the top-level instances?

I've built a couple apps with Kivy - both for small touchscreen devices. Yes, learning curve is a little weird and documentation is spotty (and sometimes wrong/outdated) but I like the concept and it's been quite robust once you get an app built.
Don’t worry, you have the rest of your life to figure this out.

Your dependencies are not the size of your code...
That is not what I said at all. I said it just takes a few libs the size of scipy to get there. Those libs are not dependencies , they are the actual code for the project
Do you consider “from scipy.optimize import minimize” to be one or ten thousand lines of code for your project?
No. Why are you fixating on the fact that I'm using an existing library as an example of a basis for a multiploer? I write libraries. My libraries are tens of thousands of lines of code. This does not include dependencies. Similarly the libraries that depend on my library do not include my LOC in their own.

Thanks for the tips. As you might infer I am 1) self taught and 2) originally a perl programmer. To be frank, I'm not that concerned with readability. But I sincerely appreciate the `setdefault()` function! I never knew that and because of that I tend to gravitate to perl which lets me do this ``` push @{$dict{$key}}, $value; ``` Which is readable to me ;)

It's the angle. The closer to parallel you are with a surface, the more mirror-like it gets. The flatter and more "glossy" or polished the surface is, the wider that angle gets. While it does look pretty dark, I've got an LCD monitor from 2001 that looked pretty dark when I looked at it at a near-parallel angle like I did just now. All that said, I wouldn't be surprised if this is just a photo-op and the computer really is turned off.

Without seeing your code its hard to say for sure but from what I read, you've actually renamed all of your images to a file called 'folder' and basically deleted them all except the last one. if you rename the remaining 'folder' to folder.jpg or folder.png or whatever images they were you'll probably see the last image you copied. You can't reverse this. I hope you have backups or this was only in a test directory!
You can download on one computer and install on another, like this: md /pypi cd /pypi pip download keyboard that will download the keyboard library into the /pypi directory, then copy that directory to the computer you want to install it on, and run this command: pip install --no-index -f /pypi keyboard btw, i got this info from stackoverflow by searching duckduckgo for "how to pip install without internet".

Python is an interpreted language. Scripts do not depend on a platform bitness. 
I haven't, but I probably will start using it for that. I'm making a lot of pixel art textures for a project and while I love the application I use for it, it's missing a couple handy things. Primarily a good way to generate noise.
Great, thanks for sharing!
If you are willing to pay for it, PyCharm Professional has IntelliJ's web dev IDE built in and fully integrated.
I see thanks, my apologies I am still getting familiar with a lot of the terminology. I had read that an interpreter is not platform dependent but on the download page for 3.7.2 it threw me when I read: &gt; Consider using the newer 10.9 64-bit-only installer variant, unless you are building Python applications that also need to work on older macOS systems. I'm guessing this is referring to modules?

Unrelated to the contents of your actual post, but I'd really recommend fixing up the CSS on your site; having a 2140x2139 picture of yourself breaking the page horizontally and taking up the entire screen vertically such that users need to scroll past it before they can see any actual content is pretty distracting and doesn't really do justice to what is otherwise a pretty solid technical blog / fairly impressive portfolio.
That would be one line of code. If, on the other hand, you wrote a new minimisation library for internal use, because the one in SciPy didn't do what you needed it to (which is not that uncommon in enterprise code bases), that may well be ten thousand lines

I didn't know something like that was possible. Can you please tell me how you did it?
No problem. So it's interesting you bring up TIMTOWTDI since python has the opposite style. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ - PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python actually says "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." 
Hey man cool project. Couple of things: A) The production SECRET\_KEY is visible. You should alter that unless you plan on everyone knowing what the settings to your server are. 1 - Why did you decide to go with django? Wouldn't a Flask app work easier/cleaner? B) There's a lot of Personally Identifiable Information (PDI) in all those resumes. I know this was by design but maybe consider having dummy fields for information as to not reveal you and your friends to the internet. Happy Coding.
Yes I am aware of this, see the kumashiro's thread for clarification
These things are aimed to a C++ audience. Python does not work that way.

Does this data differentiates between browser and electron users?
If you get to the point of packaging your code for distribution (e.g. with pyinstaller), then using 64bit WILL prevent it being installed on 32bit computers. C extensions can also cause issues if they are compiled for a different architecture than your python. I only distribute internally, so thought this would not be a problem, but there are a surprising number of 32bit systems hidden away, usually doing essential jobs.

Thanks man! I will definitely look into these things. The reason behind going for Django is that I am more comfortable with the flexibility of Django. Else Flask would be good too. :)
The a variable inside the function is local. 
How can i fix then?
That's not entirely true. A script could depend on a platform-dependent binary module
Even though your variables a and b share the same name inside and outside the function, they are in what is called "different scopes" Meaning the a and b inside function test() only exist while test() is running. The a and b you're calling outside of test are different and might as well have different names. For this to work you need to "pass" the variables to the function. And have your function "return" a result. def test(a, b) : c = a + b Return c a = 1 b = 2 Result = test(a, b) Forgive the formatting I'm on my phone . 
Thanks a lot!
You can force the function to treat a variable as a global variable, but that’s not recommended. Make sure you return a value from your function and call your function in your code. Still, it’s not recommended you use a function to manipulate a global variable in this case. Not sure what your end goal is though.

In that case it is the module that depends on platform bitness, not script. Unless your code explicitly requires 32 or 64 bit module for some reason.
No problem! Send nudes. 
another thing to point out is that you reassign the values of a and b to 3 and 5 inside of 'test' so regardless of the scope it will always return 8

People python on MCUs these days ... Well.. I hardly see any benefit other than that people who can't speak C can start fiddling with Microcontrollers. Easy path to destroying all the benefits otherwise coming from almost real time - capable hardware where each and every program step is predictable up to single cycle acciracy . 
I see lots of benefits but the drawbacks are too big imo

If they take requirements.txt, they are doing it wrong. They should take it from setup.py. 
&gt; So you are supposed to keep a list of pinned requirements in requirements.txt, and a list of the same requirements (non-pinned) un setup.py/setup.cfg? Basically, duplicating the list? You are not duplicating anything. They do two different things. One specifies the interface, the other the implementation.
Look into Django or Flask for your backend. Also, /r/learnpython

The examples page for pyparsing (https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/tree/master/examples) includes searchQueryParser.py and lucene_grammar.py. Also the packages whoosh and Booleano use pyparsing to parse search queries. Here is the base parser for your examples: # search.py import pyparsing as pp ppc = pp.pyparsing_common ppu = pp.pyparsing_unicode property_name = ppc.identifier property_value = pp.quotedString | ppc.number | pp.Word(ppu.Latin1.alphas) cmp_operator = pp.oneOf("= &gt; &lt; &lt;= &gt;= !=") keywords = (AND, OR, NOT) = map(pp.CaselessKeyword, "AND OR NOT".split()) cmp_term = pp.Group(property_name("property") + cmp_operator("oper") + property_value("value")) search_expr = pp.infixNotation(cmp_term, [ (NOT, 1, pp.opAssoc.RIGHT, ), (AND, 2, pp.opAssoc.LEFT, ), (OR, 2, pp.opAssoc.LEFT, ), ]) search_expr.runTests("""\ (person="brechmos" and address="10 Main St") ( (person="brechmos" or person="frank") and address="10 Main St") """) Prints: (person="brechmos" and address="10 Main St") [[['person', '=', '"brechmos"'], 'AND', ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"']]] [0]: [['person', '=', '"brechmos"'], 'AND', ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"']] [0]: ['person', '=', '"brechmos"'] - oper: '=' - property: 'person' - value: '"brechmos"' [1]: AND [2]: ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"'] - oper: '=' - property: 'address' - value: '"10 Main St"' ( (person="brechmos" or person="frank") and address="10 Main St") [[[['person', '=', '"brechmos"'], 'OR', ['person', '=', '"frank"']], 'AND', ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"']]] [0]: [[['person', '=', '"brechmos"'], 'OR', ['person', '=', '"frank"']], 'AND', ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"']] [0]: [['person', '=', '"brechmos"'], 'OR', ['person', '=', '"frank"']] [0]: ['person', '=', '"brechmos"'] - oper: '=' - property: 'person' - value: '"brechmos"' [1]: OR [2]: ['person', '=', '"frank"'] - oper: '=' - property: 'person' - value: '"frank"' [1]: AND [2]: ['address', '=', '"10 Main St"'] - oper: '=' - property: 'address' - value: '"10 Main St"' 
The comparison is unfair, startswith is not equivalent to k[0] == "_". To make it comparable you would have to consider longer substring: k[:5] == "12345" and to make it even more fair you would probably should compare it to something like this: substr == "12345" k[:len(substr)] == substr Additionaly you should check how the speed is affected by different lengths of k and substr and from my quick checks it looks like startswith is faster in general case.
It might be worth checking the performance in PyPy, as anyone that cares about pure python perf will be using that
Django has a built in ORM (Object relational Mapper - translates Database tuples to Python objects) Flask is usually combined with SQLalchemy afaik. SQLAlchemy has a bit of a learning curve to it but I think flask is more popular than Django (I used Django a bit and liked it ok)
&gt;The comparison is unfair, startswith is not equivalent to k\[0\] == "\_". To make it comparable you would have to conside Of course, but it is a very common case when we check prefix only by one symbol. I agree that in more complex cases startswith may be better Your cases: In [7]: %timeit k[:5] == "12345" 122 ns ± 3.14 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) In [8]: %timeit k.startswith("12345") 153 ns ± 2.93 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) startswith a bit slower. Same for long strings: In [17]: k = "123412341234"*10000 In [18]: substr = "12345"*20 In [21]: %timeit k[:100] == substr 136 ns ± 6.54 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) In [22]: %timeit k.startswith(substr) 167 ns ± 5.57 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) Also it isn't about real world optimizations, because on such level better to use cython or pypy (or even pure C). Just interesing notice :)
Use Django Rest Framework; it has a nice API for serializing data between server and client. Ie, you'll pass the info using JSON.
This does not really matter. Python executable is not an resource-intensive 3d game, that reading it from disk changes launch time noticeably. If you're one of the people that use Gentoo due to "performance" you might do it tho.
In pypy it doesn't matter :) In [4]: %timeit k[0] == "_" 10000000 loops, best of 3: 20.8 ns per loop In [6]: %timeit k.startswith("_") 10000000 loops, best of 3: 22.3 ns per loop &amp;#x200B;

I own a pyboard V1.1.0: 1. It is very easy to program because you just put your program into an SD-card. 2. Secondly it abstracts a lot of lower level stuff that would discourage beginners. 3. As a normal python programmer, I can use the same datatypes and functions. 4. It has support for advanced features like W5500 SPI PHY or CANbus. 
Interesting to see Flask slightly higher than Django as favourite web framework (47-45%). Is this reflective of Jetbrains users or an overall industry trend toward smaller frameworks/microservices/"serverless"?
And don't forget « Premature optimization is the root of all evil »
Exceptional how you precisely derived that 100% of a service users use their bloatware.
Thanks you dear.
Can't speak for Dropbox, but your typical small company codebase after 5-10 years of developer churn, legacy code, organization debt, exceptions for "just this one big customer" and new features taking priority over everything else and you'll have a very bloated codebase, little of which sees actual day to day use.
Totally agree. The post is just for showing that calling functions in python is expensive. And also if you don't like startswith (as about me, because it's too long for typing) you have an argument to not to use it :)
You can call functions from python scripts using flask library, I've started my first python-electron project two weeks ago and I did that and it works perfectly, the only downside I think is that you need to have your python scripts in an OS's specific folder. If you find another way to do it packaging the entire project please let me know, also if you need help with flask and help with calling the python functions from electron I will be happy to help you.

What is the exact error or issue you’re seeing?
Yes you just have to type à commande like this : "conda create --name environmentname python=version" Just replace environmentname by the name you want and version by thé version of python you want, after (it May take à lot of time to create thé environment, and by security do it with cmd admin) after you just have to go on your environment by doing "activate environmentname" 
I don't think you need help with Python specifically here... You should probably contact whoever's qualified with payments and security within your company first. 
I am the author of this article, feedback are welcome to improve it!
I'm not 100% sure about it, but I have a gut feeling that this is just a snippet to demonstrate the problem described in the title of the post and not actual production code. But I could be wrong.
Download and parse Wikipedia into some kind of knowledge graph. Translate question into a query you can perform on the graph. 
Thanks, I'll check it out.
&gt; Also it isn't about real world optimizations So that’s not what your whole experiment was originally about? Couldn’t you have said that same thing to yourself after getting your original results?
Are you doing this for aircraft? It’s worth taking a look at the OTIS (Optimal Trajectories by Implicit Simulation) for some feature ideas. It’ll do 3D rotating round earth trajectories as well as 2D flat earth. There is this interesting case where when optimizing attitude (angle of attack) and throttle for a scramjet, it’s more efficient to do pitch plunge maneuvers into the atmosphere. Dip down, burn so me fuel to accelerate, rise up in the atmosphere to lower drag and conserve fuel. Reentery kinda works the same, even though that is done without throttle. OTIS is a NASA code, so it’s a bit hard to come by. I’d love an alternative. It uses SNOPT to optimize the trajectory.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
is it possible to process, say, 2GB of json data with an 8GB RAM laptop? like can you get around it through code or something? by process, what I meant was to at least clean the json file and then upload it to an sqlite server or postgres or something. I was thinking along the lines of reading the json line 1 by 1, processing it, and then inserting it into the db. I have tried this with a for loop but the problem was with the "with open()" part as it loads the entire 2GB json file into memory which would then make my laptop freeze :(
For numpy, both a 32 bit and 64 bit version exists. It’s usually only very small projects, probably written by you that only support one version.
It’s fine. I use VTK to do 3D model visualization l. It can rotate in real time, do animations, do slices, plot results, etc.
Fair enough, but it sure as hell ain't 0%.
because he wrote Automate the Boring Stuff. Arguably the best introduction to Python in print today.
\&gt; So that’s not what your whole experiment was originally about &amp;#x200B; Definitely. I just was surprised about fact that startswith is slower than direct comparision. And I totally not recommend to replace all startswith instructions to == to get nanoseconds of speedup. If you're worried about such low-level optimizations - just rewrite your bottlenecks via cython or pure C. &amp;#x200B; Other things I wanted to show here that inspecting bytecode may be helpful for understanging python insides

I guess you should add the constraint that semi-colons can’t be used to avoid a new line. With that constraint in place, the main challenge is to be able to capture the input string as a variable and refer to it and its reverse in a single expression. PEP572 introduces assignment expressions and should make this straightforward. Until then, one possible one-liner is: all(x == y[::-1] for x, y in [[input(“enter string: “).lower()] * 2]) 
Oh I think it was Plotly! 
&gt;The post is just for showing that calling functions in python is expensive. The moral of the story is never, ever use function calls in Python :-)
I don't think your second function is going to evaluate the way you expect. You should split it into two functions because you are doing two explicitly different tasks. Usually you only want to have one Try statement and then include all the exceptions your are trying to catch after that. If you need multiple try statements it's probably best to have two separate functions. def create_tcp_socket(self): try: self.TCP_sock = socket.socket() except socket.error as e: print ("Socket creation error: " + str(e)) def connect_tcp_socket(self): try: self.TCP_sock.connect((self.server_address, self.tcp_port)) except socket.error as e: print("Socket connection error: " + str(e)) def encode_tcp_socket(self): try: self.TCP_sock.send(str.encode(self.get_address()) + ' ' + self.raspID) except socket.error as e: print ("Cannot send hostname to server: " + str(e))

Probably wont be an issue for a long while if you're just beginning though. And installing multiple pythons is easy, once you've had some practice. Good luck!
Sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you meant that by pulling in Numpy or Scipy, you could easily get to 1M lines. I see now you meant writing something like Numpy or Scipy. Still, I wonder how that happens. It took 25 years and 1000 people to get Numpy to a quarter million lines, and it isn't even particularly nice or terse.
Different domains have different needs. If you're in an area that has lots of wide coverage, your code gets a lot larger. Numpy has a single domain so it's code is very specific. But let's say I have to make lots of client and server software, that involves making UIs, server code, various other server processes. Depending what my domain is, there could be many similar things. For example in film, we'd have all our production tools in addition to our infrastructure software. Production tools multiply per film and department since they're so bespoke. It's easy to get large code bases
For testing we are using ground robots and quadcopters. The goal is to have it be a general framework for any vehicle that you can model though. One use case is for navigating UAVs to a target area for data collection such as imaging and atmospheric readings. I have not heard of OTIS but that definitely looks like something worth looking in to! It is very interesting to see how optimal solutions come to be depending on what your cost function is. For the specific use case I mentioned above, the goal is to have the UAV reach the target spot at a certain velocity and a certain time. Since UAVs can only go so slow (to stay in the air), the optimizer needs to create a longer path to the goal so that the UAV reaches the target at the desired time (which is a conservative estimate based on the average speed and straight line distance). The more I dig into my research, the more optimization algorithms I have been finding. I will have to look deeper into that. Right now I am using Scipy's minimize function to employ SLSQP. I found out recently that there was a bug in that optimizer that would return successful even though the constraints were not met. Fortunately, they fixed it about 6 months ago. If you use it, make sure you have Scipy version 1.2+.
Plotly is pretty good. If you don't like js, they have Dash by Plotly that's worth checking out :]

Writing it in pure python might not be the simplest task. I’d recommend looking into understanding wireshark and tshark. It might be overkill for what you are trying to do. I’m not sure what your general level of networking and hardware knowledge is.
The inspect module is useful for this type of thing. [inspect.getsource()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#retrieving-source-code) should do what you want. Note that this isn’t possible if the function isn’t defined using python itself. This is the case for many of the builtin functions—they are written directly in C to make for faster execution of very common operations.
By 'indent' do you mean a newline? Note that while you're removing all space characters using `.replace()`, you're not doing so for newlines (which are represented by the special character `\n`). By default, there will be a newline following a print() statement, but here you're purposefully suppressing it by setting `end=''`.
So would replace(/n,””) and getting rid of the end=“” work?
And yes a new line is what I meant 
So would replace(/n,””) and getting rid of the end=“” work?
I think you need to do line.strip("\n")
[removed]
That didn’t work
`.replace("\n, ")`
That didn’t work either, I’m not sure if you can directly replace a new line, I just don’t know why there would be a new line in there. 
Okay I think I see it. If you indent the two "line_string" calls to be under your for loop, it should do those things on a line-by-line basis. see what happens then
Replace and strip are only being applied on the last line of the file.

A lot of things have not changed between Python versions, so if you can't choose to learn Python 3, Python 2.7 will do.

Still didn’t work, wish I could send another picture but the part where it shows what is wrong it just says a new line is added in the middle of my string that shouldn’t be there

Or actually yeah my comment was useless. But anyway, the file is technically just one line: `"This is a test file, for chapter 06.\nThis is a new line in the file."`, so what you could do is load that whole string to one variable, and then just delete all newlines and spaces. Like this: `file_str = open("test.txt", "r").replace("\n", "").replace("\n", "")` There's really no need to iterate over the lines.
Start learning with 3, and you can easily adjust to 2 later.
Why have to of the same replace functions?

No. They're not even that different in practice so just use 3.
you should not. you should use setup.py and entry_points. Either you are creating a script, so there's no need for main, or you are creating something more like an application, and therefore you should have a function and an entry point, and the code in a module that has no side effects at import, so you don't need that construct.

I keep forgetting that not everybody is from the USA Some may not be familiar with the terminology. An MLS number is a multiple listing service number used by realtors in the USA. I would assume it would be a similar ID number for the listings for non-us. The number is the unique number identifying a real estate listing.
Fair enough.
I'd never seen it called the "walrus operator" before.
An you are sure you need machine learning for this?
I've seen it a bit, I'm not sure if Emily who wrote the implementation was the first one to use it but I've seen her tagging her posts about it with #walrusoperator on twitter.
I also use Quasar and I love it. I have not found anything comparable to the Quasar (vue) approach to front-end design. Design once (sorta...) and deploy to everything approach is awesome. That said, there are some products where I prefer to use the cef-python approach with a vue front-end. Python writes a lot of cleaner code for many purposes and with cx_freeze, you can package it all as a desktop application. I wouldn't take the cef-python approach for a product that needs a mobile or web interface, but it works pretty well for desktop only products.
I use mypy and pylava (fork of pylama for Python 3.x) for my daily linting needs.
Oh. I thought that I can write simple script for each of the function. For example, the feature - no of active devices on network would have a simple script (utilising psutil). And then there would be one main py file to run these script. Tell me more about Tshark. No, I don't need anything as complicated as Wireshark. 
I need to do predictive analysis (regression), identify outliers, identify models etc. Maybe it's not the right word, I just want a way to do data analysis. 
&gt; I think it is because CALL_FUNCTION instruction About half of that is attribute lookup actually. Try sw = k.startswith %timeit sw("_")

Slightly optimized: all(x == x[::-1] for x in [input("enter string: ").lower()])
OK. I just love that I asked "are you duplicating stuff?" and had two somewhat similar answers that started with "yes" and "no". Show how simple things are. To be honest, tools like pbr [use requirements.txt to populate the setup](https://docs.openstack.org/pbr/3.0.0/#requirements). I am pretty sure that some people reads the requirements.txt in setup.py. I really wish packaging practises would stabilize and PyPA would release a definitive guide on how to do things.
Yes, it gives additional overhead, but not so huge: In [16]: %timeit k[0] == "a" 54.9 ns ± 2.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) In [18]: %timeit k.startswith("a") 144 ns ± 5.27 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) In [22]: %timeit sw("a") 109 ns ± 4.94 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) This pure bench shows only function call overhead: In [25]: def f(): ...: 1 + 1 ...: In [26]: f() In [27]: %timeit 1 + 1 14.6 ns ± 4.55 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000000 loops each) In [28]: %timeit f() 72.2 ns ± 3.37 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) So total times: \~50ns - comparasion, \~50ns function call \~50ns attribute lookup + some other work (like attributes unpacking and so on)
Try turning debug mode off if you have it enabled. I've had some things not run with debug on, mostly functions outside of the routes but it tripped me up until I tested it without debug.
It's better practice use if-name-main protection in general to avoid corner cases where it matters. As an example, using sphinx to auto-generate docs imports every module looking for docstrings. Without if-name-main, that means it would re-run every script you had. If nothing else, that's a huge waste of processing time.
I made this as an alternative to [NetLimiter](https://www.netlimiter.com/) which I used when I was still running Windows. It allows you to limit the maximum download and upload bandwidth per interface and per process at any point in time. To quote from the readme: &gt; The configuration can be easily adjusted and new limits applied at any point, as opposed to similar tools which either can only apply fixed global limits to the interface, certain ports, or require you to start the process through them (and thus restart the target process to change the limits). TrafficToll uses `tc` (part of `iproute2`, usually pre-installed) and the IFB kernel module to setup Linux's packet scheduler based on the provided YAML configuration file. Here's a screenshot, because that's always nice, even for CLI applications. An additional GUI is planned, and I've already started working on it in the [gui branch](https://github.com/cryzed/TrafficToll/tree/gui).
&gt; To be honest, tools like pbr use requirements.txt to populate the setup. pbr is doing it wrong. &gt; I am pretty sure that some people reads the requirements.txt in setup.py. I really wish packaging practises would stabilize and PyPA would release a definitive guide on how to do things. It already exists https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/
What exactly comes under dev ops/system administration? And isnt a lot of data analysis part of machine learning itself?
That sounds so boring. He should stream programming automating that :-)
As always your work is brilliant!
amazing!!! thank you for the hard work! 
I dislike this syntax as much today as I did the first time I saw it. And it's my opinion it's a bad addition to the language. It's downright un-Pythonic. And I'm still upset that the arguments got heated enough that Guido stepped aside. Maybe he was right all along? He did invent the language after all. Just a thought.
Dang, in Go its used to just declare variables in a function.
Looks terrible in the tweet but quite nice without the parenthesis in the example 🤔
After a little bit of searching to discover just what the heck "walrus" was in python context, one quickly reads: The purpose of walrus is to make working with Redis in Python a little easier. ...ok, what's "Redis"? more searches: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. But somehow that seems to be unrelated(??) to the usage here? 
he okayed the new syntax
For us minions that moved from perl. It is nice to finally be able to write like: if m := re.search(r'regex to (match and extract)', line): val = m.group(1)
I think the name comes from the fact that the colon looks likes eyes and the equals sign as long walrus teeth.
Don't ask people to do your homework, that is not what /r/python is for.
Ah yeah, that’s definitely an improvement 
Oh good haha happy to help!
dataclasses are built-in. Perhaps you could re-implement the ORM using them. 
I really liked the idea of black but haven't used it yet. Just took a look at their playground and ewwww. Don't like it at all
`evil.startswith(premature_optimization)` &amp;#x200B;
I don't see the real improvement over: for entry in sample_data: if entry.get("title"): print(f'Found title: "{entry[title]}"') It doesn't seem like it's worth it to add a new operator to solve this "problem"?
That was just meant as an example to show how it works, do take a look in the PR I reference and the actual PEP to see some more and better usages.
Update: Electron Front End, Python backend (bundled using PyInstaller) and SocketIO to connect the two. POC is working so far. I'm getting some comments that Electron has bloated file size issues, but technically, it seems to work. 
Flask's growth isn't all that surprising. Flask is probably much more prevalent for data-analysis tasks (putting together simple interfaces) than Django. There are probably other similar areas where the developer isn't overly concerned about the web-application part as the application part--and flask is probably the easier route. Then there are even things like plotly/dash that essentially ride on top of flask. A search for +"flask" +"data analysis" returns about 1.2 Million pages while the same search using "django" returns 600,000. A similar search using "web development" shows django at about 3 Million and Flask at 1/2 that. The growth of flask is probably very heavily tied to the 8% growth of data analysis.
What problem does it actually solve? I'm not convinced with the given examples in the article.
I agree (although I can't speak to this as a reason why Guido stepped down as BDFL). This syntax is unintuitive and also totally unnecessary. As more like this is added to the language, code will become increasingly more difficult to read and make life harder for the newcomers. 
It's interesting that you join disliking the PEP and being upset that "the arguments got heated enough Guido stepped aside" without ever mentioning GvR stepped aside because fighting *for* that PEP wore him out.
Here's some more examples of how the walrus operator can be used from the [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#syntax-and-semantics): # Handle a matched regex if (match := pattern.search(data)) is not None: # Do something with match # A loop that can't be trivially rewritten using 2-arg iter() while chunk := file.read(8192): process(chunk) # Reuse a value that's expensive to compute [y := f(x), y**2, y**3] # Share a subexpression between a comprehension filter clause and its output filtered_data = [y for x in data if (y := f(x)) is not None]
&gt; Numpy has a single domain so it's code is very specific. If you consider that domain "mathematics" or "science," sure. Otherwise, the domain of numpy is *vast* are probably *grossly* exceeds most other packages.
I tried to not get into the details of why, how and when it's used but rather just showcase that it's here and that you can start experiment with it. But I did add a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ao5e8y/try_out_the_walrus_operator_in_python_38/efykd30/) with some more examples from the official PEP.
If there are multiple items with the same xpath structure, then yes,it returns the first occurrence. 
Very well written OP
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/logging/
The domain of numpy is numerics. That is separate from the domains it is used in. For example numpy doesn't need to do UIs, or networking etc but it can be used in those areas.
I disagree here. I find it a useful operation with a different-enough syntax that anyone who didn't understand it would think to look it up before making assumptions about it's behaviour. At this point that conversation is academic though: the change has been accepted and merged and is scheduled for release. What really worries me about this episode is that it shows how adverse to change the Python development community is becoming. For many years I looked at a language like JavaScript that was so mired in historical baggage that I thought there couldn't possibly be a hopeful future for it. As of ES2016, that has completely turned around and now that language is adding features at an enviable pace. I would even now call JavaScript a "modern" language in the same breath as Rust and Swift. I fear that if Python doesn't embrace change in the way that JavaScript found it's way to, it could eventually (_very_ eventually) be the popular demise of the language. It's a bit weird that OP deleted their comment, but I think this is an interesting conversation anyway.
Have they also removed Zen of python in 3.8? Since I don't see how those two can coexist, when this feature clearly violates it a lot.
Read about `__str__()` method. 
uh, I would not group data analysis in same light as machine learning. 
In a word: microservices. Django is still, imho, much easier to use as the core of a monolithic web app, but Flask excels as a wrapper for small microservices. We use Django for our core web app but will likely be spinning up several Flask instances soon as well.
Thanks! Seems like a great list. Any tools you find particularly useful yourself?
In my fantasy version of Python, `:=` is replaced by `whichis`, and `lambda` by `given`.
It doesn't solve a problem. It provides a shortcut, so your code is less verbose. Here are the examples in the PEP with my added "Versus" on how you'd likely write it today: # From: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#syntax-and-semantics # Handle a matched regex if (match := pattern.search(data)) is not None: # Do something with match # Versus match = pattern.search(data) if match is not None: # Do something with match # A loop that can't be trivially rewritten using 2-arg iter() while chunk := file.read(8192): process(chunk) # Versus chunk = file.read(8192) while chunk: process(chunk) chunk = file.read(8192) # Reuse a value that's expensive to compute [y := f(x), y**2, y**3] # Versus y = f(x) [y, y**2, y**3] # Share a subexpression between a comprehension filter clause and its output filtered_data = [y for x in data if (y := f(x)) is not None] # Versus filtered_data = [y for y in (f(x) for x in data) if y is not None] ``` My $.02? Not a compelling reason to add another operator. But I really hate lines of code that try to do more than one thing. Maintaining that kind "golf code" sucks. It takes too much brain power to read. It's this kind of laziness that causes a language to become less easy to learn and read.
Can you comment on the second and third example? Pardon for my "not seeing the difference" but I don't get what this new syntactic sugar has for an advantage. 
So, it's some kind of very limited let binding
If you like programming with async/await, take a look at [sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic), the API is **very** similar to Flask. The hello world: ```python from sanic import Sanic from sanic.response import json app = Sanic() @app.route('/') async def test(request): return json({'hello': 'world'}) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000) ```
Oh I trust you that pbr and some people are wrong. Regarding the PyPA documentation, there are nice parts. They even have a [sample project](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject). It has no requirements.txt, even though it should, if I understand correctly. It also puts very few things in setup.cfg, when [other projects](https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi/blob/master/setup.cfg) make extensive use of setup.cfg. My issue is that packaging (and related tools) keeps changing, and as a developer, I feel like it mostly forces me to re-learn everything all the time, for little benefit (though I might be wrong, obviously). Eggs are a thing of the past, yet I still end up with annoying .egg-info files in my source directory. We used to run "virutalenv", then we had a bunch of scripts to create/manage virtual envs, now it's included in Python ("python -m venv"). We had setup.py, then we moved a lot of stuff to setup.cfg, now people are thinking of removing setuptools in favor of tools like flit (and let's not even talk about the distutils days). We can specify whether we want to use setuptools or flit in pyproject.toml (new file, and new file *format*). And we also have pipenv, lockfiles and all that stuff. This seems overly complex, but I could be okay with that if I did not have to relearn everything for every single language I might be using. All languages now come with their own stack, and the best practises keep changing. As a result, someone who likes writing code in more than one language has to deal with a lot of packaging stuff instead of writing actual code. This feels overwhelming.
Ok, but surely you realize how immense the domain of numerics is compared to (say) the dropbox desktop client's UI? It has basic matrix ops, linear algebra, ffts, random states, probability distributions, [...]. Networking is, I mean... urllib3 is the backbone of most networking in python and is 6,400 lines, almost 1/50th the size of numpy.
I’m looking to make a GUI that will be run by a raspberry pi running Linux that will basically be running a display that needs to update a couple times a second that will be connecting multiple dots with lines any suggestion as to which GUI modules is the best for this application?

No, you should not. - There is no excuse to learn or write new code using Python 2 in 2019. You should not be using Python 2 in 2019. - If your corporate environment enforces Python 2, firmly remind whomever maintains it that Python 2 is EOL in 10 months. _Companies_ should not be using python 2 in 2019. - _Firmly_ means you should mention that there will be no support of any kind, including security patches, for 2.x, including the extensive standard library which underlies basically everything ever. Nobody should be _learning_ Python 2 in 2019. - Raise this with corporate ITsec if need be. Running any serious code base on what should be security-compromised infrastructure is Not Good(TM). Python 2 is a borderline security risk as of 2020. - If you're planning on using some features present in Python 2 which have been deprecated in 3.x, heavily, heavily reconsider. Python 2 does not have a sane API in many places compared to Python 3 - If your heart still has a shred of doubt in it, consult the mailing lists about why certain decisions were made. You'll find that they are overwhelmingly well-motivated. Python 2 will break in subtle, subtle ways that are hard to debug. Python 3 removes many of these cases. To summarize: # No. ### You should not learn, use, advertise, advocate the use of, or otherwise enable, through action, or tacit inaction, the use of Python 2, in 2019. #### For all intents and purposes, as of 2020-01-01, Python 2 will be a dangerous plague to be scrubbed from the surface of this Earth.
Thanks. I hate it.
\*sits in corner playing with pyramid\*
I started learning flask because the learning curve was much lower.
Agree. I've found flask a natural compliment to developing a thick front-end with React. Trivial JSON API endpoints.
I guess things like sysadmin automations, metrics and and application deployment, in my work we do some of that.
I've played around with pytrack and gpy boards which run on micropython. Getting things up and running were a breeze compared to other LTE cat-m microcontrollers. Maybe I lost some performance by not running on pure C code but I really don't need much out of my microcontroller. Basically if my micro controller moves it needs to send its GPS location. Pretty simple and pycom already had all the libraries I needed built. Overall I've been quite happy with pycom!
oh, he shaved his head!
Simply renaming the operator to `whichis` as another user suggested would probably fix this.
This is why a lot of us won't touch perl with a 10 foot pole :-/
Why would you think it's a good idea to invest time into learning a language that's EOL next year?
Flask is awesome. Happy to see! 
Can anybody quickly explain the basic ideas of Flask?

Trying to understand Flask. (And why it is so hyped? I didn't get it...)
Well it’s basically like express.js if that helps. Very minimal boiler plate to get a simple api up and running, byo db and middleware
I suspect that once people come to grips with the versatility languages like Swift offer, Python will see a rapid decline. Modern languages offer the duality of scripting and compiled performance something that likely will never be 100% accepted in Python. Beyond Swift we have languages like Julia and rust that could also help displace Python. Python will not to easily though as the standard library and the massive world of add on libraries is going to be hard for any language to replicate quickly. I suspect though that Swift has the best chance of building up into something impressive and a challenger to Python. Frankly as much as I use Python I still find it to be very frustrating as a language. 
&gt; Since UAVs can only go so slow (to stay in the air), the optimizer needs to create a longer path to the goal so that the UAV reaches the target at the desired time (which is a conservative estimate based on the average speed and straight line distance). I'm an aerospace engineer and have done a fair amount of trajectory analysis. I get that there are things like vehicle precession, rate and throttle limits as well as maximum travel rates for actuators, but that's a bit confusing. If I recall correctly, OTIS optimizes the control variables at the control points for each stage. On each stage, you can make anything a control variable including state (Vx, Vy, Vz, flight path angle, angle of attack, etc..) or N throttles. It's very general. They you define N constraints. At a stage break, you can make things like mass change or velocity or anything else, as well as constraints. A stage also has a number of output points and control points. Then, you lookup the atmospheric properties and things like CL, CD, CMy as a function of attitude and/or throttle. Integrate loads and move onto the next time step.

Python now has a "walrus operator", but still doesn't have a case statement? So much for priorities...
&gt; This syntax is unintuitive `:=` is quite commonly used in Mathematics *and* computer science to mean "is defined as" (see [this SO question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/25214/what-does-mean), or [this one](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1838678/confused-about-notation-versus-plain-old)). That's fine if you think it's ugly or something, but it's got an equals sign...is it really that unintuitive? The notation `:=` is long-standing; Algol uses `:=` for definitions. Pascal uses `:=` to initialize variables. I strongly disagree that `:=` is unintuitive.
https://www.heroku.com/free https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/is-there-free-trial-available https://aws.amazon.com/free/ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/ 
I always question what I’m doing with my time when I sit ordering imports, glad to know other people wrote a package for this
I was thinking *exactly* this while reading about the new operator. The "walrus operator" just feels *incompatible* with Python Zen. It's an operator without a strong need.
Ok, so the lack of functionality is the main feature?? ;)
Old school!
I remember hearing about this on pythonbites, have you used it?
Now I will wait for aiohttp to become next Flask
I have often wanted an `as` clause for `for` loops (like with `with` statements) so I like that this is an even more general solution to that need. I would expect to see if favored over `as` clauses once it is widely adopted.

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/) so you'd better get over it.
Not a lot built in, add only what you need with extensions, has thread-global objects so you don't have to pass "request" around like in Django, you just use it. No urls.py, rather you decorate your view functions with @app.route('/'), which is really nice for small apps. I have used both extensively if you have any more questions.
Like list comprehensions and lambdas, I can both see cases where this looks useful and cases where it's definitely going to be abused to make unreadable golf code.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY WHY WHY WHY!! &amp;#x200B; "Dude, you are a backend developer. This doesn't effect you." &amp;#x200B; Oh alright. 
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
Be aware that Reddit doesn't support triple quote blocks; you must use the 4-space indented blocks instead. from sanic import Sanic from sanic.response import json app = Sanic() @app.route('/') async def test(request): return json({'hello': 'world'}) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
Might as well just add curly braces and call it a day. Maybe I'm a purist, so be it.
Difficult to read, but also difficult to write and edit. If you are that kind of developer that strives for "perfection", this means another path to consider. Or if you need to change a something in your code, this walrus operator seems to make it more obstructed and I can see people having to de-walrus often.
huh. guido didn't take it with him when he left?
I was trying to figure out why `=` in Python was a statement in the first place and found [this old explanation from effbot](http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-can-t-i-use-an-assignment-in-an-expression.htm). Boils down to avoiding the classic C bug of `if (i=0)` vs `if (i==0)`. Hopefully it's harder to mistake `:=` for `==`. I'd sure like this solely for the convenience of testing and setting the output of `re.search`.
Wow first time seeing another Vivaldi user in the wild!
Which is weird. Some pascal shit.
I am one of the core developers if you have any questions?
I've always felt that cases like this would be more readable if something like the (underrated, in my opinion) comma operator from C or C++ were used. In Python it would look something like this: while chunk = file.read(8192), chunk is not None: pass I'm not sure the comma is the right token to use for Python, mind you, as the parser would probably get into ambiguous cases due to tuple syntax.
I am one of the core developers if you have any questions? 
Could you explain the differences? As someone not involved in data processing, I had no idea there was a difference.
&gt; dev ops/system administration Linux sysadmins use Python for their automation much like Windows sysadmins would use PowerShell. So this applies to their automation pipelines for developers they're supporting as well.
Yeah! I’m building my entire web app in flask and it’s so much better.
I'd rather see assignment being made an expression, like in C-like languages, which is exactly what 'walrus' is for. Now we have a confusion of having two types of assignment operators to avoid an "assignment as an expression" confusion. Great.
It's seem that is supported only in the new reddit there is a message [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a6cn1w/reminder_code_block_markdown_only_works_in_the/) about it. Thanks, I didn't know that I excluded a part of reddit viewers.
As an aside you might like to note that you can read the entire file in one hit rather than use your loop.
How’s that?
Did you find Django hard to pick up? In my experience it was quite good in terms of official docs and user friendliness etc.
I'm currently using ngrok to host it, but I'm looking for an external service to host it
Sure if you don't mind poor or even downright wrong responses. There are certainly vastly superior resources scattered all over the web.
That's 2 lookups, instead of one using the walrus operator.
Is it hard to migrate a mature application from Django to flask? Also, is there a particular way to organise a lot of routes in flask? Is it all single file or across many modules.
Yes, you want to allow Pythonw.exe and Python.exe to communicate on both private as well as public networks.
I'd say machine learning is a subset of data science.
because... ?
Huh, I can't stand new Reddit and the app I use does support triple backtick blocks, so didn't realize.
I love Flask
[quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/blob/master/README.rst) says it extend the flask API, I'd be curious to compare it with sanic (Haven't used either, just came across both on Reddit)
not nearly as interesting as python being used more for data analysis than web development. &amp;#x200B; or that only half respondents work on a team. or that half the respondents employed by companies in IT/software dev industry for the IT/software dev industry. I dont even know how to interpret that. 58% respondents less than 5 years experience. &amp;#x200B; all of those wtf's are more interesting than flask gaining 2 points over django. &amp;#x200B;
Automating the connection of different rest APIs via we hooks? I'm using flask as glue between tower and netbox
Extremely complex and difficult yeah. The docs were good with Django, but just configuring it took forever and turned me off to it. With Flask I had a basic web app in 20 minutes. What I'd really like now would be a good tutorial on SQLAlchemy with Flask so I'm not writing raw SQL queries.
He's being an asshole. Ignore him. 
Looks like you're using .sleep() like I did, and that's not super accurate. It also can't run as a part of other programs. I'm looking to also build a customizable pom timer for my own personal use, but my timer part is using sleep so I need to redo that before I proceed, so that pom can be used within other programs. 
Yeah if you're coming from any typical MVC web framework you're gonna have a hard time figuring out Django with it's jarring terminology and hard opinions on everything. At least that was my experience. 
Open the file and use the \`read\` function.
I think it's unintuitive to assign a variable in an if statement, which is exactly what this syntax enables
Not the person you're replying to, but I personally find Django *much* more complicated than Flask, from a setup perspective and for extending its capabilities. Django is just so... heavy. Flask is lightweight, but still powerful. Admittedly, it's been several years since I used Django, but it didn't have a way to share sessions between load balanced servers. Also, when I last tried it, the ORM didn't support simple things like multi-column primary keys, and unions were very ugly to write. Beyond that, I've never been a huge fan of ORMs, just because of the overhead and performance hit, so I always felt like Django was overkill for me. I'm curious if any of that has changed?
That being said flask development has really slowed down.
Amazing, an April Fool's joke is now the world's most popular Python web framework. 
Sounds like pyramid. How did flask get to be the cool kid?
And is this what we can expect, as well? name = "John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt" if b := name.strip(): print(b.upper()) othercode = [x for x in range(100) if x % 2] if a := 1 or b := 2: print(b) # John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I'm not totally against the operator, though I don't like that it's symbolic rather than English, but it will foster some unclear code. 
If you used the Django ORM, probably very challenging. Flask has a concept called blueprints which help with organizing routes. 
In the `file.read()` example, the non-walrus code has to repeat the `chunk = file.read(8192)` in two different places. As the code between the two occurrences gets longer, it gets harder to see that you're doing the read-test-process-read idiom, and you risk changing one of the two reads and forgetting to change the other. With the walrus, you've not only eliminated the duplicate code, but erected a big neon sign that says "this is a read-test-process sequence". I feel like that's a net improvement to maintainability.
Yes, Django is fine for that. Also, /r/learnpython is the better place to ask questions. 
shouldn't the logical and work?
For someone who’s started learning programming (me), and wants to go into web development, would you recommend learning Flask or Django first ? 
No, different semantics. With the comma operator, the value to the left (file.read(8192) in this example) is discarded and only the value to the right (chunk is not None) is used
Your question makes no sense. Also, if you're asking for help it goes in /r/learnpython.
If you're using old.reddit, it's not supported either.
Here's the quick start for [version 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py) reporting. Links to other APIS (Management, Embed, etc.) are at the top level of the site. &amp;#x200B;
sanic's the best choice for now, but it has some glaring security issues and the occasional annoying design choice. [vibora](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora) looks very promising and it's got a fresh release (hopefully making it readier for use) coming this month
thanks
But again that's one domain versus a company that has to work in multiple domains. 
And if urllib3 is representative, then you need 50 of those domains to reach the size of numpy, or 200 of them to reach a million SLOC...

If you are new, use Django to get a lot done fast; use Flask and follow RESTful methods if you want to learn more.
[https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/) is running on Pyramid.
Your line of reasoning is flawed which is why you're having a hard time envisioning a large code base. You're always trying to bring it back to a single product whereas it's really many many things at once. There are multiple things going on at once. There is server code, desktop code, multiple client side features. A decently feature filled user interface can be 10k lines easily or more. That's not even including if they implemented their own UI library. It's a lot of pieces times lots of domains that adds up. Then there's the requisite integrations tests etc...
I'm curious, how do you do TLS for flask apps? Do you proxy through nginx or something? I can't seem to find a good way of doing it.
How does Django ORM compare to SQLalchemy(I presume most use it with Flask)? I have experience with Django ORM and am considering starting new project in flask. Thanks!
Yes, I proxy through nginx.
Actively developed and stable as a rock, what's not to like? 
What are advantages for Django over Flask? I learned flask first when trying to add a webui and api for the data my scripts were pulling in and since it was really easy and let me do everything i needed to i never went on to learn Django. I took the sp-admin bootstrap template and added flask to pull in the info i needed into a dashboard and it works so well i just clone my template repo and keep using the same admin page with flask to quickly get a webui up and going without having to do much work. I don't have anything against Django or taking time to learn it, i just never hit a point that flask couldn't do what i needed. 
Yes, there are many other operating systems that have already started distributing with python 3 as a default. Support for version 2.7 will eventually stop. While there are many conversations from 3 that can be used with 2.7, many industry leaders as well as current technologies use 3.
&gt; a mayor new feature I think I end my reddit for today and cook my pasta
Hope you might like my WIP project: asynchttp. It is basically a \`async\` wrapper around stdlib BaseHttpRequestHandler. For a lot of use-cases this is good enough. It gives you complete control. For e.g. you can write code to just check the first line in request and take action before even headers are parsed. &amp;#x200B; Link: [https://gitlab.com/balki/asynchttp](https://gitlab.com/balki/asynchttp) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
it was always slow. it's not a bad idea, flask is stable and basically a wrapper around other packages, it does not need constant updates.

Reminds me of the StackOverflow comment about parsing HTML with regex.
The only product of I found is [https://requires.io](https://requires.io) (I've never used it!). I would not be surprised if GitHub started coming into that space.
well semantics aside I would say that your typical data analysis role is looking at data and features and employing whatever statistical techniques to find correlations or predictive power from it, e.g. which "feature" is the most important in a predictive model or what combination or weight of features matters. Machine learning primarily is the shift to having the model build the features for you, in ways that humans might not be able to interpret or even understand. 
Check out r/learnpython. That sub is better to ask questions about learning Python. I believe there is also a list of good resources.
&gt;What I'd really like now would be a good tutorial on SQLAlchemy with Flask so I'm not writing raw SQL queries. I can highly recommend Miguel Grinberg's excellent Flask tutorial. Part 4 is on SQLAlchemy: [https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database)
for guided tutorial type stuff, i've always been fond of Zed Shaw's old site https://learnpythonthehardway.org/ for the hardcore good, always go to the source https://docs.python.org
Thnx! 
The oreilly flask book @ [https://flaskbook.com](https://flaskbook.com/#) has a pretty good section on how to use sqlalchemy with flask using the plugin: [http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/).
More correctly, 2 `Mapping` lookups. Which may not be just a simple dict. E.g. could be a proxy to a database table.
Django has really good docs but my problem was that there's a lot to learn before you can get up and running. I don't want to be concerned about databases and my admin page immediately, I just wanna throw a function at an endpoint.
I think web-server is the only one correct solution.
Perfect! Thank you for taking the time.
It's simple and is used in some introductory courses, fwiw. For example Harvard intro to CS course uses Flask to introduce webdev.
Relevant username.
Why is 2/3 of this article just on updating Python and Pipenv?
Thank you!
I generally use bottle rather than flask for microservices because it is a heck of a lot better performing, and arguably even simpler to use.
To each their own, but I prefer raw SQL queries instead of using an ORM like SQLAlchemy. 
Maybe you'd prefer yapf, possibly with the facebook style. 
Everything is unintuitive if you've never been exposed to it. I also learned programming with Perl and when I dipped my toes in Python, it was unintuitive that an assignment has no return value. But I quickly learned to work around that.
The reason for not doing manual queries is because it's easier for sql injection if you're not careful.
&gt; What I'd really like now would be a good tutorial on SQLAlchemy with Flask so I'm not writing raw SQL queries. Check out [Miguel Grinberg's Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) if you haven't yet. He covers SQLAlchemy pretty well.
If that was true ('that' meaning it is unintuitive to assign variables in an if statement), then this sentence shouldn't make sense.
Wait.. what?!
The tool is [tech.io](https://tech.io), that's a product developed by the startup I work for (hence by my colleagues and me). That article has been written by me during my spare time though.
A lot of people say Django documentation is great, but I find it hard to read. 
Well something like this: [http://www.pythonsecurity.org/](http://www.pythonsecurity.org/) or a range of other python related security things that use Python 2. 
http://mitsuhiko.pocoo.org/flask-pycon-2011.pdf
&gt; Maybe I'm a purist So you only use language features that existed in Python 1.0? I'm sure in 10 years when they add the $!$ operator, we'll get purists asking what was wrong with just using the := operator.
You've said enough! Along to 3.7.2, I go!
Machine learning is only a (smaller) part in the role of a data scienctist. There is also data retrieval, data preparation, deployment of ML models, monitoring etc.
Use scypy library.
Awesome! I haven't used it but someone else had mentioned it to me. I appreciate the help :)
PrettyPrinted’s [SQLAlchemy Playlist] has helped me a lot. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmMXHVSvS-BlLA5beNJojJLlpE0PJgCW)
Wow! You can't make this shit up.
This is very true! I might have mis-spoken when I said I generally don't use an ORM. I've been using [Records](https://github.com/kennethreitz/records) on most side projects recently. By the same person that created the Requests library.
If I remember correctly Reddit is running non pyramid
It’s really similar. Use Flask-alembic to do migrations just like django.

&gt; # Share a subexpression between a comprehension filter clause and its output &gt; filtered_data = [y for x in data if (y := f(x)) is not None] Finally, there's a good solution for this. Before, I think the best way was `[y for y in (f(x) for x in data) if y is not None]`, which is clunky and takes a minute to read correctly.
Why would you think it’s a good idea to use security products that aren’t adapting to an EOL platform?
I’d do both. Do The flask mega tutorial first and build a site and modify it to some personal project. Then do Django getting started tutorial next. Flask will teach you the plumbing of the whole web-app because you have to build everything or use an extension. You’ll learn a lot about how it all works. And you’ll be able to build quickly. You’ll also be able to build a hot pile of unmaintainable mess. Django will teach you about structuring a project to work well with others.
Working with sqlalchemy, we moved back to raw sql for a few reasons: 1. We've already made a choice on the database stack so there's no advantage in using a wrapper for multiple database backends. 2. We almost entirely used the low-level portion of sqlalchemy. But because we're using a wrapper, this actually obfuscates what's _actually_ run on the server. And it's difficult to obtain the precise sql string run. 3. Optimization of slow queries nearly always requires loading the sql string somewhere and then iterating over it to make it fast. This is most easily accomplished in something like DataGrip or pgcli where you're working directly with SQL. 4. It's not immediately obvious how to do some of the more specialized queries with a wrapper like sqlalchemy. As a consequence, it's generally more straight-forward to simply encode and run raw sql. 5. sqlalchemy just doesn't have a good interface for something like the COPY FROM command. For all of those reasons, SQLAlchemy ended up hindering rather than making thins easier. I think it's useful for some really specific niche cases, but it doesn't really address our usage.
You’re absolutely correct but I needed that sweet sweet karma 😂
I personally love this. Predominately use a language where infix and inline expressions are common, this is acceptable: { s:f@\:r:(key;value)@\:x;b:(|:)2#y;(s;b,s) } and if[i:count x; func i]; assignments are done with colon : but colon is overloaded in specific combinations. In the above s, r, and b are being assigned, i in the latter. But python is easily my next most used, often integrating the two, and contanstly find my self making quick slips or lamenting I coun't use neat tricks like: if m := re.match(p1, line): return m.group(1) elif m := re.match(p2, line): Can't wait to try it!
As someone who is super fond of the pipe operator that you find in elixir, R, Julia etc, has anyone seen any proposals to bring it into python?
It's more like "bring the features you need" than "bring all the features just in case you need it"
Yeah right? It's amazing that more people don't realize this. Also django didn't get traction until Guido(not a web dev) said he would use it. 
Pyramid is my go-to. It's flexible and gets the hell out of my way. 
The thing i noticed with django is that, if it is your first project with it, you'll run into many roadblocks but once you get over them you'll start to really appreciate the whole thing. It took me the better part of 3 days to get to a point where i understood how the parts i needed to use work and i didn't even dig that deep. Like, i barely scratched the surface really.
After Zed Shaw insulted Python3 some time back I wouldn't touch any of his work with a ten foot long barge pole whilst wearing disinfected rubber gloves :-(
I don't think that module offers a functionally complete interface as it has no build-in support for headers, cookies, or auth. &gt; all seems to point to urllib.request https://pypi.org/project/wget/ uses urllib.request under the covers, so you _could_ apply that advice to the source but you will be much better served by using current, complete http module. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25214959/cookie-authentication-with-python-requests 
[https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list) or [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor). In comparison /r/learnpython is crap.
Try reading this [http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and this [http://sscce.org/](http://sscce.org/).
Are you still using the engine or did you dump SQLAlchemy all together?
We still have a few lingering spots, but primarily it's entirely sql based and just using subprocess with psql.
You can also check out peewee instead, quite good and easy to use
So long as you use parameterised queries, you should be fine with plain SQL
For completeness, I'll say focus on Flask. I find Django to be both harder to get the basic "hello world" in, and to be getting in the way more than helping once you get truly proficient — once I got my frontend skills up, it's now easier for me to _write an admin site_ than to deal with whatever ModelAdmin didn't expect (I still do — that's what I get paid for). And its ORM is okay-ish, but not really something I'd pick if I weren't using Django. What I'm saying is that while I'm maybe not opposed to having batteries-included frameworks, the things brought by Django don't spark joy. Now we just need some to tell you to learn neither. 
Seconding this. You shouldn't run any security software which lives on an EOL stack which is actively not receiving security patches anymore.
[Klein](https://klein.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is another option for async/await flask-like microframework (on top of Twisted)
Peewee has some unexpected behavior around booleans (and vs &amp;) in that both run without error but one will produce wrong results. Also parentheses are required for every logical statement. I found this frustrating because even though the docs mention those things, it's just a brief mention amidst a lot of other documentation. It'd be much better if these things functioned more intuitively. According to the developer there's no way around it.
.......... aaaaaaaaaaaa!
why on earth would you shell out to psql and not use psycopg2 ? which BTW has direct support for COPY
Because psycopg2 is \_fucking slow\_ in comparison; the maintainers do not want to shift to use postgres's protocol instead opting for a simple 2-step swap instead.
I would be a bit careful in saying "get a lot done fast" it really depends. If you need something lightweight and to understand the concept of models/routes/migrations etc. flask may be the way to go. Django does a lot of the heavy lifting and is heavier by nature so it really depends. Their both sort of learning a new language so to speak.
Bravo
I would recommend Flask. I have used both but it really depends on what you're trying to do. Flask is very lightweight and you add extensions as you need them. Django is heavier but does a lot of the heavy lifting out of the both. It comes with it's ORM and admin which does make managing things easier down the road. They both have their pros and cons, but as a beginner Flask is better as an intro than Django IMO.
The mathematical methods you list deal with various differential equations, typically systems of differential equations. I expect these are going to be *solved numerically* in your course. Exactly what methods of numerical solutions to differential equations that will be used can vary, there are no shortage of methods out there. However, in the end, they are little more than addition and subtraction. Since you say you are new to this, it is of course convenient to use library functions, so you don't have to begin your learning right in the mess. SciPy is the place to start, especially the [integrate class](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html). Some problems are addressed with Fourier transforms, which also can be numerically solved with [another SciPy library](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/fftpack.html). I think [this blog post](https://www.danham.me/r/2015/10/29/differential-eq.html) presents clearly a fairly simple toy problem similar to a mass action kinetic problem and how to solve it with Python SciPy functions as well as how to create some pretty graphics. It all becomes tougher once you get to partial differential equations. The math can become pretty hairy. It is possible you will be given MATLAB functions that contain a lot of machinery implemented already, at which point it may be too much effort to replicate in Python, given your stated proficiency. However, I fully endorse your intention of using Python for this rather than MATLAB, since the latter just does not scale well to larger software suites, which are more common in industry.
This looks terrible and makes the code less readable. No wonder Raymond Hettinger dislikes it.
that's fair, he was pretty bombastic imo. i still think the tutorial is a nice intro.
Haha your sentence is very logical though: "if x then y". The walrus operator essentially removes the "then y"
Thanks for this but I'm confused. I was complaining about the learning curve of Django, not Flask...
I think this `while` example is the only use case I'll adopt. (But of course others will have other opinions.)
Most Python users won't have experience with installing an alpha release of Python to try out a new feature, so it's worthy of explanation.
Pascal doesn't own walruses.
[Safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) is another tool that checks for security vulnerabilities in the packages your code depends on. There's a great talk about Safety and Bandit here: [https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/43518-watch-out-for-safety-bandits/](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/43518-watch-out-for-safety-bandits/)
Listing mock and tox with the testing frameworks isn't really fair to them since they're not testing frameworks. Mock is what it says on the tin, a tool for mocking. And tox is essentially a task runner at this point. And listing "IT/Software Development" as an industry is interesting, especially since it's by far the most selected response. I have a feeling that either don't identify as a someone in a particular field (eg I've always described myself like "software developer in the finance sector") or don't actually know what industry they work in. Unless 44% of people responding actually are employed at software consulting firms. Not surprised at the 21-29 range being the most prevalent in the age range, but it's also telling of other responses. Makes me take the 11+ years of experience result with a grain of salt, would expect 3-5 to be the top by a far margin based on the age result.
&gt;I'd rather see assignment being made an expression, like in C-like languages, That means that you introduce the subtle bug of forgetting an equal sign while confusing the newbies.
&gt; No urls.py, rather you decorate your view functions with @app.route('/') This is one of the things I love about Flask over Django
&gt;Is it hard to migrate a mature application from Django to flask That would end up being a complete rewrite of your application. 
It's not written that nicely though. A more realistic example would be: while True: chunk = file.read(8192) if not chunk: break process(chunk) Personally I dont like the new operator that much, but I dont like the drama either. I think if 'walrus operator' was just part of a bigger changelog in major update of the language, it wouldn't have created so much fuss.
Requests seems to be the way to go. Thanks!
Old reddit runs on Pylons, Pyramid's precursor. New reddit runs on Node and interacts with the API of old reddit.
filter(None, map(f, data))
*sits on a stranded island forced to use Pylons*
IMO the best way to write that is `[y for y in map(f, data) if y is not None]`.
AWS Certificate Manager + Elastic Load Balancer handles it for me
Django has a lot things baked in ready made so for medium to large apps it is very good.
I never understood why we can't just use the attribution operator for that , like if m = data.get('title') : print(m)
The 'then' is where it's always been. &amp;#x200B; if (x := f(x)): y &amp;#x200B; If x (x being f(x)) then y
Yes, I did. I was still extremely new to python at the time and switched to Flask. I think if I was a stronger Python programmer at the time I could have made it through. 
&gt; What I'd really like now would be a good tutorial on SQLAlchemy with Flask so I'm not writing raw SQL queries. Careful what you wish for. Depending on the complexity of the application, ORM isn't always the answer.
Reading this thread, he DEFINITELY replied to the wrong person. 
Interesting - I hadn't seen `filter(None, ...)` before. This is a lot like the (almost) equivalent Ruby code: `data.map(&amp;:f).compact`.
Yes, and I found it quite helpful. It exposed some subprocess calls I didn’t realize were a threat. I also appreciated how configurable it is, allowing you to ignore specific warnings globally through a `.bandit` file or in a specific location with `# nosec`. I setup a simple script `./run.py` that would use Python’s `subprocess.run()` function to call Black autoformatter + isort -&gt; MyPy -&gt; Pylint and flake8 -&gt; unit tests -&gt; bandit. Maybe overkill, but before making any PR I would just have to run `./run.py green` and it would give me the confidence everything was likely to work. CI would also enforce this.
I think the walrus is clearer. It tells upfront how long you'll be looping.
Were list comprehensions against the zen of python too?
Ah yeah that makes more sense. 
I think what /u/bitcoin-dude was getting at was my statement (and your code example) both declare a variable but then don't use the variable we declared in the block itself.

A lot of languages allow assignments in expressions. Python now does too. Are you now not going to touch it with a 10 foot pole, or will you continue to use it with the aid of a 12 foot pole?
Considering the number of times that various people have mentioned that the lack is a PITA, ignoring their input is one of those language turning points where philosophy triumphs over usability. (Hint, that's usually a bad thing. If writeability/readability aren't the overriding factors in language design, then odds are the language is being designed by idiots.)
That works if `f(x)` is really just `f(x)`. `f(g(x))` (`map(f, map(g, data))`) or `x.attr` (`map(lambda x: x.attr, data)`) or a mix of the two end up making it worse.
"Practicality beats purity" is still in there, as far as I can tell.
Virtually every perl script I've had the displeasure of having to try to debug is written like the above. Not a single python script I've had the pleasure of debugging has looked even remotely like that. Here's to keeping it that way.

SQLAlchemy Core + alembic are really worth it over raw SQL. The ORM layer I haven't used.
*cries in Bottle*
Primary keys are still limited to a single column AFAIK. Covers the 90% use case for me pretty well, although I guess I know a few tables where it could save ~30% data. I'm curios to know when you'd use UNION queries, however! I've only very rarely seen any use for them - and then only when writing ad hoc reports in raw SQL. When do you find yourself reaching for a UNION? 
Thank you for the link, very interesting!
Sure, but making simple custom web apps to unclusterfuck my workplace tends to work with simple data (for the most part). A lot of this stuff is just tables of clock times, dollar amounts, and hour meter readings off of various equipment. Very seldom do I have to do much with the data other than convert it to excel for the other managers so they can make bar charts.
I'm not sure if you are arguing for or against ORM ...
I'm not terrible with python, but I have perpetually failed at learning how to implement flask :( I have followed many videos, many new and old blogs and websites and I just cannot seem to make it snap. The @ format and linking things to my variables isn't something I have figured out yet and it's been frustrating. I've successfully used python to connect to network devices, to create and analyze spreadsheets, and to pop out semi-formated reports, but adding a simple webportal isn't as easy as it seemed. 
Django has already made a lot of decisions for you. You don’t have to think about how you want to implement a user system for instance. You just need to know how Django wants you to do it.
&gt;Extremely complex and difficult yeah. https://github.com/syntarsus/minimal-django/blob/master/minimal.py 22 lines of extreme complexity?

That's true, although the `lambda` solution isn't terrible: `[y for y in map(lambda x: f(g(x.attr)), data) if y is not None]`. However, I think Ruby beats all the Python solutions in that case: `data.map{|x| f(g(x.attr))}.compact`.

How long did it take for you to learn how list comprehsions work? How long to learn how the walrus operator works?
read the sidebar post in /r/learnpython read THAT sidebar include an actual question
No because you wouldn't have any scripts
No because you wouldn't have any scripts
Also you can use `__main__.py` so your packages can be used with python -m path.to.package
Yeah, this the only one, that kinda supports it, while majorly failing the others
Spelling things out instead of using symbolic notation is flaring up my COBOL and FORTRAN PTSD.
The example provided is almost exactly the same as the example syntax in the [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#id7) if (match := pattern.search(data)) is not None: # Do something with match So I suspect you'll start seeing more Python that looks like this in the not-too-distant future.
Sorry wrong forum !
Erm, less then 5 minutes for both. It's easy to understand how it works. The problem is with having to read it, especially months after writing it or looking for other people code. When you read comprehension - it's readable and simple. You read and immediately see what would be the elements in this new list. When you read this operator - you are forced to do extra steps in your brain to understand what's going on, which takes a toll. Of course you would understand it, but it makes reading and understanding slower and prone to missing mistakes.
That works in this case, given that you don't really need a list and don't care that `filter(None, ...)` will remove `0` and `''` and other falsy values. However, if you need attribute access instead of just functions or other comparisons than truthiness, map and filter ends up much more verbose. Compare: # current way [member.nickname for member in (group.get_member(MEMBER_ID) for group in group_list) if member is not None and member.nickname is not None] # map and filter with only builtins list(filter(lambda nickname: nickname is not None, map(lambda member: member.nickname, filter(lambda member: member is not None, map(lambda group: group.get_member(MEMBER_ID), group_list))))) # map and filter using operator from operator import attrgetter, methodcaller def non_null(x): return x is not None list(filter(non_null, map(attrgetter('nickname'), filter(non_null, map(methodcaller('get_member', MEMBER_ID), group_list))))) # assignment expression list comp [nickname for group in group_list if (member := group.get_member(MEMBER_ID)) is not None and (nickname := member.nickname) is not None]
&gt; When you read comprehension - it's readable and simple. You read and immediately see what would be the elements in this new list. Most people learning them are tripped by the list comprehensions being "out of order". I know, I've shown them to people and it's always a pain point for them. &gt; When you read this operator - you are forced to do extra steps in your brain to understand what's going on, Less so than the alternative. When you get used to it's less step because you just read a single concept you are used to. At least it's how it is with other languages that have it. The only tricky part in those other languages is to use a single equal when you meant a double which the walrus operator doesn't suffer from.
I found Django incredibly over engineered. The “batteries” included philosophy sometimes goes too far and is also “trust the magic”. Flask is very simple and does only what you tell it and not much more. For large MVC apps Django is great and manages the project well, but I haven’t written a single, large MVC app in years because Flask fits all but the most extreme use cases better. 
Without knowing peewee at all, I would guess you have to use &amp; to invoke any sql functionality, because `and` isn't an overridable operator in python. 
Good guess! ;-). I wouldn't expect most Python developers to know that.
Colander.
&gt; Less so than the alternative. What? How? The alternative is when one line of code is responsible for one single action. How is that: [y := f(x), y**2, y**3] might be easier to understand than y = f(x) [y , y**2, y**3] No extra operators. When you read each line you immediately see what happened there. Vs. I read the line and "start to calculate f, saving it to something reusing this saved data immediately on the same line.
Also true, I do like that lambda version. [My other reply](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ao5e8y/try_out_the_walrus_operator_in_python_38/efzicc2?context=3) has a real-world example with multiple alternating map and filter steps, which is where it really breaks down imo, but for one map step that would probably be best. I see your Ruby and raise you Kotlin: data.map { f(g(it.attr)) }.filterNotNull() and Rust: data.filter_map(|x| f(g(x.attr))) I think we can generalize it to "any language with left-to-right chainable iterator operations and succinct functions-as-expressions beats all Python solutions."
&gt; I see your Ruby and raise you Kotlin **no string bets, please!** --- _^(I'm a pointless bot. "I see your X and raise you Y" is a) ^[string](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^[bet,](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^(and is not allowed at most serious poker games.)_
That is a case that won't come up often. The biggest readability gain is in for loops.
I think it's a common trajectory - first learn flask because it's simple, then learn django because it does a bunch of stuff for you, then realize you really need to use a front end framework for web apps, learn some js and build you APIs in flask (because its simple) - profit. Fill out jetbrains survey
That is the case from a good usages from the PEP.
Writing raw SQL queries sometimes can be the right thing to do when you need that level of control, performance, or an ORM would be unweildly to define models. I help maintain https://GitHub.com/honza/anosql for helping manage SQL in .sql files, but calling them easily from Python. And https://GitHub.com/nackjicholson/aiosql for doing the same on python3.6+ and asyncio database drivers.
Testing code is great, but as a data analyst, testing the data itself is even as important or more. I really like [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) data validation library.
We have a few different similar options like Dask and [vaex](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex). Would like to see comparison.
collander is not pyramid
I think it is. And your second example is not PEP8 compliant.
Could you elaborate where a web framework fits in data analysis? Are people setting up endpoints for internal use that do some analysis?
Oh right, sorry. I do it sometimes when write code in reddit. Well yeah, if you think it should be added, then they should remove the Zen.
I think it's overly dramatic.
Please checkout https://GitHub.com/nackjicholson/aiosql and https://github.com/honza/anosql you may find them helpful.
It's almost like there are a bunch of competing goals, and everything in the language is a tradeoff of satisfying some while not satisfying others.
Flask, all the way. It is so easy to pick up and get working quickly, which will give you confidence to learn even more. 
I don't think my line of reasoning is flawed - I think I'm being polite by not saying you're probably a pretty poor programmer, or your architecture sucks if your file sharing app exceeds a million SLOC. Or, really, if most any program exceeds 1M SLOC. Networking we know can be &lt; 10k sloc to implement from nothing (urrllib3). Same for cryptography and hashing (actually &lt; 2,500 each for those). We know dbx uses Qt for UI, but whatever. Tk is 200k SLOC, so in really round numbers a quarter million for a somewhat basic cross-platform UI. Which doesn't much matter, since they use Qt. You say a decently featured UI is 10k lines -- that's 1% of a million for what should be somewhere &gt;&gt; 10% of the total product.
It's purely informational. Now there are two conflicting items in the code. One should be depricated.
`while True: ... break` is a workaround forced by the absence of the walrus operator, and is deceptive as to the termination condition for the loop.
You're thinking too small. It's not just one app. It's an ecosystem of applications running to provide a larger product. This is why you're not perceiving something that can be that large. I'm curious what your experience is as a developer where you haven't run into large code bases like this? It's fairly common at any large company to have many code bases in the tens of thousands of lines of code range. 
True. Yours is better.
I ordinarily wouldn't shorten code in this way. The only time I think that this sort of thing is appropriate is for "back of the envelope" calculations when you're actually solving a problem in the command line and never even saving the code. Like OPs problem. Basically, I shorten like that when I'm using Python as a desktop calculator. I don't even look at internet points. Reddit is populated by a lot of laymen and young kids. So they don't like what I said, I am not bothered in the slightest.
I guess you are talking about bulk inserts because if you had to shell out for every SELECT, spin up psql with a new connection on every call, and receive result sets over pipes, that would be ridiculously inefficient. 
Fair, ORM would make my workflow much easier
I'm not sure you quite realize how big a million lines is. It's not that I can't perceive it. There are lots of large codebases that I know of. The linux kernel is about 20 million lines, and windows 50 million. Nautilus, the default GNOME file manager is 100,000 lines. Linux 4.17 dropped 500,000 SLOC by removing support for intel 386 CPUs, to give an idea of the scale of the code required to support a particular architecture in the kernel. Evidently, I know how big numpy, scipy, etc, are. For a filesharing app to reach 4x the size of Numpy is a (bad) feat. There must be a lot of crusty code in there to reach that size with such an uncomplicated problem. I mean, people implement basic file sharing apps in &lt; 1,000 SLOC all the time as toy code golf or learning projects. To become a thousand times bigger than that is true sprawl. I'm not a developer, I'm an engineer. I maintain two of my own scientific libraries (think skimage or astropy, etc) which are ~7,000 and ~3,000 SLOC, resp. I also use a number of other libraries that are on the scale of 10,000 lines or so. I'm sure supporting scale (dbx is something like TB/s globally) takes more than a code golf file sharing program, but a factor of a thousand more code? Really?
I picked Django for my project because it has both the web part and the ORM in the same package. Maybe I should have used Flask+SQaLchemy, but I’m not rewriting all my stuff to accommodate that (mostly because I really don’t like urls.py and my data is not structured to play nice with Django’s admin interface). 
The @ format is known as decorators if you want to research it
I would recommend starting with bottle rather than django. For a simple web page with a few APIs, bottle is a great tool to start with.
Why, though? Flask is objectively shit, and Django is objectively godlike. There isn't even a performance overhead. Other people are *wrong* about this.
It's part of the Pylons stack, though, and it's widely present in Pyramid projects.
It's in none of mine over the past 10 years. 
Thank you
Thanks I will look into it
I hadn't thought of that. I'll try it out, thank you!
You aren't able to see the forest from the trees. you're consistently considering only one aspect of an entire ecosystem that makes up the product. For Linux, how many lines of code go into actually making a bare bones distro with all the POSIX tools included and a windowing manager? In Dropboxs case they likely have client UIs, client based hashing and comparison tools, servers, server management tools, compression libraries. They mention a custom fork of python and likely have cpython extensions. This all adds up and all needs to be ported. Noones saying there's no cruft. There most certainly is. But removing cruft is orthogonal to porting to a new stack. You want to port as is and flag stuff for future cleanup. But the goal is to reach parity first on the new stack. Anyone with production experience at a large company wouldn't bat an eye if they were told there was a million line code base. 
I'm working on a tweet generator using a markov chain. Does anyone have a nice simple flask project repo I could check out that uses jinja2? I would like to get a basic idea of the file structure and everything. Watching some tutorials now
I recommend uninstall everything, download and install either Anaconda or Miniconda. Create a new environment for running tensorflow using conda create -n tf python tensorflow-gpu Conda will handle all of the binany and dll installation for you
Hey there. I downloaded the game and would love to give it a shot, but how do I start it?
That sounds really handy. I’ll have to give it a try sometime!
Thanks! Will check them out
Found flask easier than Django from the start, but NOW, I just use flask because I use flask... So, Django doesn't get any "love" from me...
I have uninstalled everything and now I am using pycharm. It works flawlessly....
I also recommend that tutorial. I'm a beginner when it comes to programming, but his blog series is clear and direct. You'll have something that **works** in the end.
That's what I do. I work for a generally non-technical company that happens to do a lot of e-commerce. I have a bunch of nightly scripts that pull data from various APIs and save them into my local database. Sales, marketing, user metrics... the usual business metrics I guess. Flask serves up a few front end pages in jqeury or vue.js, most of which are for me to generate ad-hoc excel reports for management. The typical flow on the front end pages is I have fields for start date and end date, then different options I can choose depending on what I am asked for, and a GO button. Every couple days somebody asks me to come up with some random info like comparing the last 6 weeks best remarketing ads against the previous 6 weeks and against the previous year or whatever, I tell them to give me a couple hours. I fill the fields, hit the go button, come see what you guys are bullshitting about on reddit for a couple hours, then deliver the reports.
I've done a bit of both Flask and Django, and have a few side project ideas for Flask applications but I cant really think of anything to build with Django which isnt a blog/todo app etc. Can you give any ideas for an application which I can build and in the process get acquainted with the different features Django has?
Essentially yes--people do set up stuff for internal analysis. I do mostly devops and creating custom "dash boards" is fairly common. Yes there are many packaged solutions that have apis and interactive with other solutions. But there are also a lot of internal databases and custom needs. I mentioned [plotly/dash](https://dash.plot.ly/gallery) and it actually is pretty easy to get some good custom interactive stuff going. And it rides on top of Flask. I by the way have nothing against Django--I think it is a great framework--It is just more than I typically need for doing internal dashboards.
Wow that seems incredibly in depth and specialized. I really like the idea of taking all those other variables into account since we obviously can't safely fly an aircraft making the assumption of a simple model with no outside interference. Is OTIS performed in real time or is the trajectory generated offline? It sounds like it would take quite a bit of processing power. 3rd order polynomials would certainly be a good way to go. Having polynomial parameters is definitely better than using thousands of control variables that all lie on an arbitrary curve. The nice thing about Bezier curves is that they have additional properties that make some computations faster/easier. For example, a Bezier curve will always stay within the convex hull around their control points. You can also split a curve at any point and obtain two new curves. The goal is to provide a platform that can generate safe and optimal trajectories for multiple autonomous vehicles in real time. I just started my research so I believe there is still a lot to come from it. We are looking into things such as: providing better initial guesses to the optimizer to reduce the optimization time, implementing dynamic collision avoidance, flight via camera feed, and in general speeding up the entire process. Mind sharing some high level points of some of the things you've worked on?
I started a little project to take videos, convert the frames to ascii, and overlay the original audio. Still finalizing the code, but if anyone is interested I can share the code. If anyone has any ideas to improve the effect, please let me know. Currently using a 70 character set for the ascii art. 
!hello
67% of professional python developers are using it for mobile development? Nope
The road to Django nirvana is long. Most travellers carry a flask on their waist and a bottle in their backpack.
Have a point on a graph follow a circle function. Make it do that at different rates for each of the side and top circles. Add up coordinate combinations to form each of those desings.
I had experiences with Flask but couldn't picture a web app end product. Which tutorial are you speaking of that would have an end product? I'd love to get an idea of what I could do with it.

&gt; Is OTIS performed in real time or is the trajectory generated offline? It sounds like it would take quite a bit of processing power. It's not done in real time. You can go for broke, but most optimizers work on the principal of getting inside the constraints first and then optimizing. Typically, I just lob a rock (set reference area=0.00001) first. The code will make a restart file. Then you dial up the reference area until you get a sane baseline trajectory (e.g,. a shuttle that doesn't nosedive into the ground to minimize heat, which is correct). Then I might change the optimization criterion (minimize heat, vs. maximize range) and you can get something fairly reasonable. It seems like you're more after a feedback control system. It should be fairly straightforward to tune then plant model.
Sorry, should have specified: get *a lot* done quickly. Like, as you say, you need a lot of heavy lifting and most of the things you'd want to do have already been solved. Flask, you end up rolling your own often.
Would love to see the code on github.
Just cleaning up and commenting. Will post the github link tomorrow. 
I love it and hate it. urls.py is a lot better for seeing a quick overview of the app, so is really good for complex projects. But the flask way feels a lot more immediate, light weight.
&gt; Covers the 90% use case for me pretty well Definitely. I don't want to make Django out to be a bad framework by any means... I think it's a good thing that they're focusing on the main use cases. For me, it's just that there were a few situations (at the time) where it literally wouldn't work because of an existing data structure. Which, yeah, you could argue that we could have changed our data to match, but that wasn't really an option. Also, I tried SQLAlchemy as a bolt on, which did support these things, but I just didn't like its syntax. Same as the above... UNION isn't needed all the time, but there are edge cases where it can be very useful. You can query from multiple tables with similar structures and combine the data locally on the SQL server... this can be a big efficiency increase, assuming SQL isn't running on the web server itself. When you're talking about dozens of web servers hitting dozens of db servers, you'd be surprised how much local network traffic is taken up by simply moving around data sets. Because a large part of logic can happen in memory on the db server before the framework ever looks at the results, the efficiency can definitely be worth the time. Again, it's not used everywhere, but it definitely has its benefits.
That is very interesting. Thanks for sharing.

This is awful
Emulating a hardware device that the system we are developing has to interface to. The emulator will be be used during testing until we receive the actual hardware device. The device that I am emulating has two UDP interfaces. One interface is a command interface. As commands are received over this interface, the hardware performs actions. The second UDP interface is a status interface, the status interface provides status at a 20 millisecond rate. The status messages that are sent over the status interface reflect the results of any previous commands, if there were no previous commands, defaults are sent. Since there are two UDP interfaces that share data, I am currently trying to decide if I should use multiprocessing or Threading. Queues will not work because status messages are always produced at a 20 millisecond rate (even if no commands have been received, default status messages are sent) and can be updated from the results of processing commands. This is just how the hardware device works. I hate using locks, but I am not sure how to get around it in this case. I am also slightly worried about the performance. I know python is fast enough. It's the determinism that worries me a bit. I need the status messages to come out at 20 ms +/- one millisecond. I can't have occasional hiccups messing up the timing. &amp;#x200B;

Did you install it with a different version of Python than the system default?
how would i check?

Thats the beauty of opinions. Each person got their own.
I see a lot of love/hate over this operator. Some people actually think Guido and the Powers That Be should have just reused `=` and to those people I'd just like to say... Yeah, in C/C++ you could do something like ```c if (x = y) { do_something; } ``` and it was a huge source of bugs because if you actually wanted `x == y` you might not realize you made this mistake since it's not a syntax error, not a compile time error, and not even a runtime error. Your program might actually run fine! IT MIGHT EVEN WORK FINE FOR A LONG TIME!! When something finally fails, it's very likely to be somewhere else in your codebase far far away from this mistake because the problem probably won't become a problem until it snowballs into something big enough to make some other part of the system fail. Good luck and God help you in tracing the problem back to `x = y`. The fact that the `:=` doesn't work outside its intended purpose and `=` still works like you'd expect it to IS A GOOD THING.
You should ask this in r/learnpython.
Yeah, what is with the emphasis on parenthesis? Maybe, its because the syntax is so problematic that most if the PEP explains that without parenthesis this operator messes up the normal evaluation order and as such requires then for all but a few actual use cases? This syntax is uglier than C code once you wrap everything in a brackets to get it to eval correctly. In 30 years of python, no-one missed having a syntax that combines assignment with control flow, but now we get to enjoy all of the fun of side effect ridden one liners that C has enjoyed for years. Why does the PEP prohibit := at the top level? I'd much prefer to have := everywhere and drop = all together, python meets pascal. Given assignment (=) has to appear as it's own statement, you could replace then all with := and it would make zero difference with how the code worked, that is if := could be used at the top level. Why disallow chaining? Now you actually need a well defined eval order there is no syntactic reason no to have it. I'd find chaining possibly more useful than this operator in certain contexts. It's a new operator, why don't you define the eval order so that := evaluates before "is" and = ? This fixed almost every example that need parenthesis. The operator itself is easy to wrap your head around, its an assignment that returns the value of the assignment. Simple, but why introduce syntax that creates more problems than it solves? Right now most python is simple enough that you don't even need to worry about eval order, its natural, and mostly surprise free. This moving the language forward, the is C -&gt; C++ style (d)evolution. Insane really.
