that has been possible in emacs for decades.
I know. I assumed since you couldn’t fix your issue with programming Python 2.5 on your MacBook that you didn’t know that. 
Not that I'm not surprised there's an API for this, whenever I see a "How to do thing in python" I expect a little more than import thing thing.do_it()
it's not that I couldn't do it, it's that I didn't want to do it and I didnt want a mac book pro. 
Smart move 😎
I wouldn’t suggest buying books immediately. I suggest just start watching some YouTube videos and see if they are helpful. I’ve learned pretty much everything I know of the language for free.

I first used code academy free python course to get a general idea of the syntax. Then I learned both python and R through datacamp. People have mixed opinions about them and I think most of the negatives are true. But you still do get a lot of practices and expose yourself to the things you can do with them. Then I read a few books but I didn’t learn any coding from them, but algorithms and ideas. I think the most important thing is practice and exposure to real world problems. Just by learning new materials every day, you won’t improve as much. In data science jobs, you do not need to remember all the syntax at all. You can always learn as you go. There isn’t anything you can learn and just use forever. I spent a lot of time searching for a new job and got one in about 7 months. 
Sure, I'm specifically studying the optimization of maintenance in manufacturing systems. So I created a simulation that lets me specify different machine degradation models and implement various maintenance policies. The goal is for manufacturers to be able to use this tool to measure the performance of their current maintenance practices and identify areas for improvement.

Wow, I've been a python enthusiast for a while now and just learned this, Thank you!
Thanks!
Finished the code academy! Although, I already understand a lot of Python from past coding endeavors so I won't be learning - mostly practicing.
Uh yeah, America is mile shaped
Indeed a beginner's trap. Thanks!
Thanks. Happy cake day!
From your use case it seems like you are making some sort of CLI tool. Might I suggest using click? http://click.palletsprojects.com/en/5.x/prompts/#input-prompts see this example for how easy it is to do what you want. 
Pelican. 
Any reason?
Thanks for the feedback here. Much appreciated. 
Thank you for the feedback / thoughts
Thanks a ton! I've just sent you a pm
Hey there, I’m actually planning to do just that with my Dell almost identical to that setup, trying to get some advice on stable Linux distributions. Development-wise, I’m learning Python and C++ and some Java as well. Ditching WIndows for Linux seems like the right move but I’m stuck on what distribution to adopt. Any advice greatly appreciated.
are you asking for Database or API? if you are asking for Database, mysql is simple enough and can do most of the jobs done. if you are asking for API then tell us what database you are using. &amp;#x200B; if you decided to use Mysql, Python have the package that help you to talk to Database
Yes you can, go to websites such as Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, Coursera, etc. They have high quality free courses (if not, it is around $12 on Udemy) and teach everything from scratch. Goodluck and don't give up.
(Note that finding a job is subjective to _many_ different things, sometimes out of our control. YMMV) I'm a school-taught software engineering, self-taught Python developer who currently has a job doing Python work. I think learning the basics and building blocks via school helped out a ton, but not once did I learn(or use) a single bit of Python for school work. All of that came with basic programming knowledge and a _bunch_ of Google searches and reading the documentation. I think that learning the concepts is a lot more important than learning a language, especially when they are similar in style(object oriented vs functional). If you understand loops and control flow, which collections to use where, and things like that, you should have no issues applying those skills to Python(or Ruby or JavaScript or whatever). I don't know of any personally, buy I can guarantee there are good books out there for learning the building blocks of programming and also learning the basics of a language, such as Python. Tl;dr yes, especially if you're a self-starter. Learn programming basics and pick a language.
Much thanks. Always trying to learn you know :) 
As someone who learned Python a long time ago, I wish the meetups that exists today had been available back then. Putting your code in front of real people who can easily understand your particular problem is really helpful. If you don't have the cash for a mentor, I would suggest treating tutorials just like you would treat a part-time job. Try to complete the Django tutorials and set yourself a goal. Try to also find a local meetup and don't be afraid to come and ask for help. Most meetups are just an excuse to get together for issues just like this to be brought up. 
there's a built-in SQLite support: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
Thank you for your input and your links. I will keep that in mind as I go crazy for APIs :)
Yes. Make sure to network with professionals and find out what the actual jobs are trying to get you to do. Scripting up a storm is fine, but you probably need to know how to send stuff over the actual internet.
Thanks heaps! As a beginner it’s been hard to find sources on the proper way to format my code, this will help heaps.
&gt; I liked having my Monday mornings back so I could do actual coding. How noble of you. I would've used that time to jerk off on Reddit.
I have no formal training in Python (outside of a college course that I totally blew off and learned nothing from). I’ve been working with it for the past two years professionally, learning it as I go along. I wouldn’t exactly suggest the course I took, but there are a couple of keys to understanding Python-many of which I suspect you’re familiar with from your basis in Java. The primary packages that I’ve found especially key are NumPy and Pandas. Know how to extract data and load data. Otherwise, list comprehension is key to Python, as is indentation. Most of this can be learned through just Googling your queries. Best of luck!

I've been using Mint recently and love it. It's based on Ubuntu so it's pretty stable. 
A value beginning with a zero "0" is treated as a hexadecimal 0xFF = 256.
in languages of yesteryear, 0 prefix was code for 'interpret this number in octal', which could lead to many kinds of surprising bugs, not least the one it just prevented you from making. If you did not know about the octal behavior, and all your digits were less than 7, congrats, you just managed to introduce an unbelievably annoying to diagnose bug into your program.

Youtube downloader and converter, works, but not exactly what i want. trying to implement the status bar via script as you would see it from running the command manually.
A value starting with the literal number `0` is interpreted as a number with a different base. `0x` is used for hexadecimal numbers. `0o` for octal numbers and `0b` for binary numbers. `0xFF = 255` `0o20 = 16` `0b11001 = 25`
&gt; It is much faster than the built in library. What's the tradeoff? Is it cross-platform?

Bit late to the party here, but if opening a Jupyter console running in the same python kernel that your code is using is something you really want, check out the [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) and [Hydrogen Launcher](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen-launcher) packages for [Atom](https://atom.io/). I much prefer how Hydrogen shows the outputs inline, rather than opening new windows each time.
Just make one, shouldn't take long to change all the text colors to the same thing.
They're tools for different purposes. A blog is just one of the things you can build with Django. Using it for your described purpose seems wasteful of your time. Nikola is almost purpose-built for your described scenario.
there is r/learnpython to help, probably better there
I'll evaluate this.
“Somewhere” that’s scary!!! 
&gt;In most programming languages, integers with leading zeros are perfectly valid. How many have you worked with? Many (even, I daresay, "most") C-family languages, which are generally the languages most-commonly in use nowadays, use the same 0-prefix octal-literal convention

Have you looked at [Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org)?I haven’t used it in a couple of years now, but based on your vague description of the problem I think it might be useful. You mention you’re not looking to send commands to the remote system, just open a “session” — that sounds like you’re trying to open an interactive shell. Fabric can do that. Look at [open_shell](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.14/api/core/operations.html) on the Operations manual. 
There are a few things missing from this discussion, I think. First, your basic `__new__` looks like this: class Foo: # Might derive Foo from some other class: Foo(Other) # If so, the following still works def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs): instance = super(Foo, cls).__new__(*args, **kwargs) return instance If that's what you want, then *don't write it*; the default version of `__new__` does that for you. One reason you actually might want to write `__new__` would be that you want it to return something different. Second, it might seem odd that both `Foo` and `cls` are specified above. This is so that you can call `__new__` to construct an object of a different class, which is typically a derived class. In fact, this is what the call to `super(Foo, cls).__new__` is doing: calling `__new__` for the superclass to create an object of class `Foo`. Third, `__new__` is not required to return an object of the specified class. Whatever object is returned, the version of `__init__` for *its class* is called. For example, if `Foo.__new__` returns an object of class `Bar`, then `Foo()` will call (1) `Foo.__new__` and (2) `Bar.__init__`. And fourth, I've been Python-ing for many years, but I have never used `__new__` to do anything practical. So it is possible that the above is messed up somewhere. If so, please correct me.
Questions like this belong in /r/learnpython or the python discord. Try googling some articles. There is no difference in the beginners articles for a programming language whether you are a computer science major or not. You still need to learn the exact same things.
I'd say that realistically you'd have a better chance getting into the field by starting at a less code centered job, like help desk or general IT and moving up from there 
It is not cross platform (though I haven't tested). Subprocess also provides some functionality that this does not and thus usually subprocess is the better tool. Sometimes, however, you may be spawning a lot of processes in which case speed can be more important.

subprocess does a lot of extra work to make it feature rich and cross platform where this just calls fork() and exec(). The benchmarks I ran show it being 3x faster

I mean, any database you that has a python API available I guess? They are all pretty much the same in terms of "easy". I don't think there is a real database out there that beats out others in terms of "easy". If you have more of an idea about how much data you want to "upload" and how frequently as well as what type of data you want to "check frequently" then maybe there might be something better for your use case. A quick google tells me: - sqlite - mysql - postgresql - mongodb - redis
I also can make software faster by removing features and making it break in certain circumstances.

Seems the concern is the physical security. As in the risk for an actual human interfacing with usb. Not uncommon when it comes to valuable IP. Seems hes just try to remove the human handling. 
Is your while loop properly indented? 
That error message points to bad indentation or missing bracket/", or possibly you pasted it into the console and missed the indents? Parsing errors like this are hard for a computer to pinpoint exactly. Questions of this type should be in /r/learnpython which is better equipped and more willing to help with this. This subreddit is for the news and ~~arguments about assignment expressions ~~ discussion.
You go to /r/learnpython and ask there. But since you're here - you have a missing parenthesis in the line current\_savings = portion\_saved\_per\_month + (([r/12](https://www.reddit.com/r/12)) \* current\_savings)
Yes I forgot the indentations in the while loop. In my original, I had it indented and still got same error

What about a simple USB Switch. Should allow two devices to share one USB device. 
Just as a point of reference since today I had an opportunity to read in a 897MB csv file. I did it into a juniper notebook. According to timeit. 22.4s +/- 1.56s per loop (mean and std of 7 runs) 
I would add to this list Udacity's Deep Learning Nano degree ([https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)). I found this course well structured, great content, excellent video production quality and the access to mentors and the markers is invaluable. If you have a question about a topic you can simply jump on a chat with a mentor and they can help you sort it out.
sqlite would be the easiest since there's no server to setup. 
This looks really cool! I'm surprised `databases` was still available on pypi.

Sorry subreddit autocompletion defeated me, /r/learnpython 
&gt; I'm not really looking for using keys or making this more complicated than it has to be You ARE making it infinitely more complicated by not using keys. &gt; I'm not looking to pipe through any commands or anything just open the session. You are describing the standard ssh client once the keys are exchanged. ssh &lt;ipaddress&gt; does exactly what you are trying to do.
Both nasa and spacex use metric so...
There is no generally robust way to do it perfectly and automatically, no single tool can understand the semantics of every possible e.g. internationalized message catalogue or static embedded GeoIP database in a package directory. I use some nasty find commands to do it in one Lambda project. One option that might be worth following is running your app under `strace` and exercising every possible input: ```` strace -f -o /tmp/huge.log python my-app.py &amp; ./run-app-tests.py ````` The resulting `strace` log will be a huge mess, but grepping out all the `open()` statements and then further grepping out just the subset inside your Lambda package directory /should/ reveal almost everything needed, assuming your tests exercise your full app, and the files loaded do not depend on the runtime environment in any way (such as LANG variable)
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I guess I'll run a couple sample events through the package under `strace` and see what happens... and cross my fingers. Any thoughts about how using `pip install --compile` would affect that process?
i like to use hdf databases with the h5py package its very ez pz, i can send you some sample code if you can't figure it out from the docs. It was suggested to me by a research scientist i worked with that was from one of the national labs while I was in grad school, and find myself using it all the time on personal projects
unless you're worried about cold boot time, I'd do the opposite of --compile -- bytecode is /much/ larger than the original source, and depending on how the local filesystem is implemented on Lambda, may worsen boot by causing additional IO 
Look into the new Lambda layers feature. We had the same problem but with the layers feature we can push all of our dependencies in a separate layer and mount it to our Lambda at runtime. 
I’ll look into this thank you. For the sake of the project, this is a basic minimization and maximization of a function with a set of decision variables and the constraints on these decision variables. 
How would I go about making one?
I've been down that rabbit hole.... you're still limited to 250MB total unzipped, including any layers.
Can you describe your problem more clearly? SQLite is definitely the easiest db to use from Python, but I've never heard anyone call db insertions something you "upload info to". Are you maybe talking about something else than databases?
Hey thanks for the response. This is a basic maximization and minimization Problem with given decision variables and their constraints. I honestly believe that using Solver for Excel can solve this (which is the only way I know how to do optimization) but the project uses Python. 
Good to know, thanks.
Hey this is cool thanks for the share I will be sure to check this out!
Oops. Sorry I missed that. Have you looked at Fargate? 
Dude, install anaconda. It's fool-proof (unless you update to python-3.7 and use vscode)
I had not. Looks promising though, and a lot easier to deal with if I end up going with containers instead of lambda
You have a really fascinating use case, the Lambda 250MB limit. I don't know of an answer for you unfortunately. 
As a middle schooler, I learned python in like 2 years by self-teaching myself. As of right now, the best project I have done is a drawing tool. Python is an easy to learn programming language, and I would say that I am an intermediate in python.
I just checked some of my internet orders. Your FedEx tracking number logic is false. You may want to write your extraction code accordingly. (The fedex tracking number i checked did not start with a 7 and was 15 digits long)
We have some projects that are just too large for Lambda and Fargate has been great for those. Not dealing with cold boot issues has been nice as well.
The only option I can see is to have multiple lambdas with their own different dependencies and restructure your code to call other lambdas when needed.
Check the docs on customizing a theme: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-colors-and-fonts.html 
So you must be using SQS or SNS to accumulate events which would otherwise trigger the lambda, and then a CloudWatch schedule to launch Fargate and process the events.... costs are probably lower than doing the same thing with lambda as you accumulate larger piles of events.
Also, try googling these types of questions, that was the top result for "pycharm customize theme"
Google maps API costs money doesn't it?
It comes with a hefty cost but there are much smarter people than google out there, who write their own code.
Python itself doesn't need this much. An intro course probably isn't going to be too resource intensive. This is more than enough.
What I was getting at is that there are other free mapping apis?
Long list of parameters is always harmful, no matter in Java, C++, or Python. Imagine there are three integer parameters in the list, and you pass in wrong order... In Java and C++ without named arguments, the solution to avoid long list of parameters is to wrap the parameters to an object. An object has named fields. In Python, named arguments can be similar to the named fields of an object, though you don't need to create an object, which is convenient. If there are no named arguments, you have to wrap the parameters to a dictionary (which is commonly used in JavaScript) for named fields. 
SQLite has no server, no connections to make, nor any authentication. It's literally just opening a file and starting your SQL work. The datatypes it offers are also very versatile.
Oh yah. There is open Street maps and others. But google hog the Limelight and that's why every run behind it. Maybe others are not as good in advertising and marketing like Google.
There is a distance matrix Google maps api with plenty of free calls per month. It will return the exact same result as a Google search would (including travel time)
I wanted to stated that a long list of parameters was harmful, but I deleted the line. Do you find named arguments helpful? I never knew JavaScript wrapped parameters in a dictionary. Interesting!
Sir, if I'm not wrong, upper limit of any google Api's is around 2K. When you are crunching million of data in a day then this limit will exhaust in few seconds.
I suppose the word 'plenty' is relative. 
Love Ubuntu 18, really stable, just works all the time
&gt;&gt; Do you find named arguments helpful? Yes, but I usually avoid many parameters in a single function. &gt;&gt; I never knew JavaScript wrapped parameters in a dictionary It's not special to JS. It's a common idiom to pass many parameters in a single function.
Cool. Will surely check that out. Thanks Buddy..
You have an eagle eye. I corrected the code in blog and surprisingly the km distance calculated using geopy geodesic distance is same as spherical distance...that's y I always rely on Awesome people like you for any feedback..Thanks one more time..
DynamoDB. It takes 5 minutes to provision one and you can connect via Boto3.
Tree shaking in we pack requires you to use imports everywhere, doesn't it? Even for assets. The analogue would be to use ast but I'm sure for numpy, scipy, and any assets you wouldn't get that functionality. Maybe you could just remove the largest components and see what's necessary.
Self taught full stack developer here. Books and online videos are helpful additional resources, but what you need is a project. Domain knowledge can be more important than Python or development skills. Often it is much harder to understand the problem and the solution than to technically code it. Whatever field you are in, identify a need and then Google each component piece one at a time. For example, years ago I was a niche commercial insurance underwriter and our rater was a dos program from the 80s. Now I didn't know anything about development but I knew a thing or two about the insurance calculations and the underwriter workflow so I Googled one part at a time to build a better tool as a Django webapp and learned a shit ton on the way. Books and videos are great for like a few hours but still the end of the day you need to do the work every developer does... Spend hours performing trial and error while reading stack overflow articles while trying to build a single specific festure.
Do it in Django staticpages. Not because it's the best solution but because you can extend it from there if you want to do fancy stuff. You will gain familiarity with the limits of out-of-the-box Django features and experiment with different ways to extend it.
Awesome tutorial. I am new to web scraping, I was wondering what are the pros and cons of Beautiful in comparison to other libraries? I hear of others like selenium, and my xlmx.
I tend to like them and use them for most functions. To me, it is easier to understand than creating one-off objects and chaining together multiple disparate functions together. That said, if you are in a situation where you need to pass more than three or four parameters, it's worth taking another look at your software architecture.

How else would you learn it?
big difference between learning a programming language and learning how to do useful work with a programming language you can learn the language from books and such. in order to learn how to do useful work you need experience on non-trivial projects. i've hired people who were self-taught and submitted strong resumes/portfolios featuring those projects. 
Python let's you have optional arguments where you define default values. Without using kwargs (names) then they are assigned in the order giver, but if you use kwargs then you can skip and assign a value to the last one without giving a value to the others. A step further allows you to define a dictionary and use it like an informal object without a class definition and pass it in as a single argument and the named ara be assigned automatically. 
If you have 100 args in a java constructor, you use a builder. In Python, named args will remove any ambiguity.
[PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/index.html) is what I used for Linear Programs. It comes with a buikt in solver and can use others if you have them.
It’s reassuring to know people without degrees can still land jobs. Thanks for the input! 
Definitely. My first language was technically batch on Windows, but my first real language was python, I actually used it to make a jarvis-esque system for my room, the best way to learn is just googling examples I'd say
It's referencing the time Lockheed Martin used miles instead of kilometres without telling their NASA partners, which caused one of the Mars rovers to crash into the surface lol 
You're getting a lot of mixed information here, some of which probably doesn't apply to the types of problems you want to solve. Differential evolution or genetic algorithms are good tools, but I think you should try some solvers more specifically designed for your types of problems. Two pieces here: first, you want a modeling language to define the variables, constraints, and parameters of your models. Pyomo is very good and open source. Pyomo will generate a standard, compact representation of your model that will get passed to an optimization solver. For linear problems, start with cbc. It's open source, and as easy as saying SolverFactory('cbc') in pyomo. This works for problems with or without integer (or binary) variables. If cbc doesn't find a solution quickly enough (or at all) it gets more complicated. There are other open source solvers but cbc is probably the best. There can be many ways to define a model, and it's possible you can define your problem differently and solve it faster. Easier said than done, but if you want to get into this, the book Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams is great. The easier solution, if you're doing academic work or have a large budget is to get a license of gurobi or CPLEX. They're the gold standard, and so much faster than cbc. If you still have no luck, then try a different type of solver. They're more work than just defining variables and constraints (you won't use pyomo here). DEAP is an option, but you'll have to turn hard constraints into penalties, and modeling integer variables is probably complicated. For nonlinear problems, it's a little tougher to give advice without more information. Some open source options that work with pyomo: ipopt for convex problems; bonmin for convex problems with integer variables; couenne for non-convex problems with integer variables. Again, there may be clever ways defining your nonlinear model that can make a huge difference in solving it.
A good exercise for OP would be to build a table with languages and what the behavior of leading zeros is. Something like this might help: https://repl.it/languages

I definitely do not have the Python skills to make a career out of it, but I heavily relate to your background! My programming background started from an intro Java class 2 years ago, just like you. I decided to pick up Python for scientific use a few months ago, and I'm amazed at how comfortable I was after just a few weeks. I felt like I knew was was technically possible in programming (ex. I knew I could do this task by defining some function) and the rest was just Googling syntax. I'm not sure what comes after simply being confortable for scientific use. PM me if you have anything you'd like to ask!
If you can't be bothered to read and follow the directions why should anybody bother to do it for you? Everything is right there in your link.
You could run your program with a code coverage tool, then remove all the objects from all the dlls that aren't being used.

So best to use a little of everything? I've found that changing languages and frameworks is never that tough. The foundations are always the same so learning those frameworks is just something that takes a bit of time but nothing more. That makes me wonder why some employers seem to care so much about which tech stacks you know. What does that matter anyway? If you know the foundations then the rest is nonsense.

That is how I did it. I tried to do a personal project in python rather than PHP and then I said "f it, ill try for a python job." Got the job and the rest is history 
Does your advisor know that you're seeking contributors?
Following all the imports is NP-hard, but the dataset is tiny. mypy and every ide checks them already. I'd love to throw away _unreachable_ code when packaging for tiny run-only environments. The go developers are laughing their &lt;10MB container images while I'm dragging at least 10 times that around.
I had to write something that validated whether a Sodoku problem was correctly solved.
Cool. Sounds interesting.
for slightly older laptops, get Mint 18.3. Rock solid, based on Ubuntu 16. 4 GB of RAM is totally sufficient. If you want it to scream, get the XFCE version. Minimalist, but fast.
I have tried and I can't do it. 
Cool! I’m a super beginner but it doesn’t sound that unapproachable. I guess making sure that every row, column and square add 45 at the same time would be the easiest solution to implement.
You can also do this in a lower level way with Pillow and AggDraw, or go direct to a PDF with ReportLab.
"tiny"... in anything that a person is considering deploying to lambda, sure. I'd imagine that the problem would be small enough you could do it in a CI/CD pipeline if you needed to. There's undoubtedly a need for something that could do it if such a thing could be built in a reusable, distributable way.
They had me build an sms scheduler to integrate with Trello using AWS services to handle scheduling. Yeah, this accurately portrayed the skills needed to do my job; it was also a paid interview, so they paid me for the time that it took to do which was pretty sweet.
One thing not yet mentioned is that Python doesn't support method overloading since method parameters don't have types. Strongly typed languages like C# can have two methods named the same with different parameters. Having optional parameters that are specified by name is one way Python can achieve the same thing without declaring two different methods. A common example where you see this is in database connection methods where the same connect() method can take a single parameter connection string, or takes named parameters to create the connection string.
I took a similar path as you, kind of. I learned java as my first language, then took a pretty long break from it. Later came back and self taught myself python and now I work as a python developer. That being said, python isn't the easiest entry point into the industry in my opinion. I initially came in as a manual QA tester on some big boring enterprise application, and slowly started contributing to the company's test automation code. When I switched jobs, I levied that experience to get a role that is purely task automation (not just testing). I don't know you exact goals with wanting to make a career change(money or working on cool stuff), but c# is very widely used amongst all of the microsoft shops and may provide a slightly easier point of entry.
I keep seeing in various places that you can build just &lt;needed dependencies&gt;, if you do a custom build of scipy, but no info on how to actually *do* it.
All pure-python calls to `fork` are fundamentally buggy. You *must* write a C extension, or you might deadlock.
It actually is a little more complicated than that, because each row column and square can only have each number once. There are brute force ways of doing it, but part of why I think it was a good test question was it helps see if a software engineer could come up with an eloquent solution. 
Had to implement a small feature in their application. I was picked bc others did not finish. 
No you can't. You have to get at least bachelors. Otherwise you are better off flipping burgers at McDonalds
I am building for fun an encoding server software to automate the flow of fansub groups from getting the raw videos to uploading the final revision. There is a lot of shell programming in the background while python acts as a layer between the WEB UI and shell scripts. 
We're in the process of hiring a bunch of new people. I volunteer to do all the coding challenges first to see how hard they are, and most of the ones picked by more senior engineers than myself aren't that hard. HOWEVER what really grinds their gears are people who applied for programming-related jobs and simply cannot code. Being able to read the problem and write something that runs, even if it doesn't work, puts you miles ahead of people who lie to get in the door. They are allocating 1hr for the whole interview and allow 45 minutes to get "something." Pace yourself and talk through your thoughts. I don't have the questions, but I was asked to come up with a one-line solution for finding the least amount of flips to get N number of dice all the same value: def solution(A, p='123456'): return min(sum(map(lambda a: 0 if a == x else (2 if dict(zip(p, p[::-1]))[a] == x else 1), map(str, A))) for x in p)
That’s why I say that, if you add from 1 to 9 is 45. If a number is repeated, the solution is never going to be 45 unless you do very weird things like 999771111 but I guess you’d need to test it against every possibility.
As far as whether it accurately accessed my coding skill, I would say it not an assessment, so much as a filter. I couldn't have completed the problem, it would have been foolish for me to be hired, especially since I was interviewing for a senior position. I have the opportunity to interview incoming job candidates and when I am interviewing a software engineer, if they cannot create a solution to the problem in the time allocated, it is pretty much a no hire. But being able to complete the problem, doesn't make them an automatic hire, there is a lot of other things that have to be in place for that to happen. Interviewing is a tricking process, but one thing I have always found is that I have regretted giving the okay to hire someone who has struggled on an interview programming test.
Depending on your actual use-case AWS batch could be more applicable than Fargate. It uses runnable Docker containers for code management
It's not simple as that
I can't think of anything to use a manual strategy would be to get your business logic to 100% coverage with **effective** tests then add your dependencies to the coverage and start chopping away at non-executed paths also, tree-shaking has been around much longer than a couple years and not specific to javascript
Ok, I trust you of course, I’m just a monkey programming-wise right now
It really varies from company to company even for the same position. You can find examples of interview problems on glassdoor and usually several ways to solve it. Keep in mind that coding interview takes up to 45 mins in most cases, so it won’t be some super complicated problem that can’t be solved within this time frame. If you’re preparing for the interview I would highly recommend to go over basic data structures (linked list, tree, graph, etc ) and algorithms that are studied on computer science course. Read Gayle McGowan book for understanding approach and spend couple months on leetcode. This always works for me
First, r/learnpython Second, usw xlwt (write) instead of xlrd (read) 
...exactly. Adding them up does not actually test if the sudoku is accurately filled out. The entire grid could be filled with 5s and your tester would consider the answer correct.
I was asked to write a sodoku solver in an interview, I used `set()` theory. The interviewers didn't even know what `set`s were &lt;_&lt;
Right, programming doesn’t understand about being obvious or common sense
Raymond Hettinger has a great example for this. Take this function call: twitter_search(‘obama’, False, 20, True) You can derive what “obama”’s purpose is in the function (search criteria), but what about the False, 20, and True? With named arguments, it turns into this: twitter_search(‘obama’, retweets=False, num_items=20, multilanguage=True) Now there’s no guessing at what the arguments mean. You’re right in that some editors put the field names in when you put constants, but what if someone reading your code isn’t in that editor? What if they’re viewing it on GitHub in a pull request? Named parameters will document themselves in any environment regardless of editor.
The program understands whatever you code it to understand. That is why I like the Sodoku problem and think it is a good test of a programmer. If you are making the assumption that there are not going to be "very weird things" than you will fail that test and not be hired. I am not trying to be over overly critical of you, but you did say you were a super beginner, so I am just letting you know, it is good practice to think through all the weird things that might come up. Especially if it is a problem where you are assuming there is going to be bad input (if there was not going to be bad input, then there would be no point to have a validator)
Thank you for your answer! You’re 100% right
huh, that is weird. I use sets extensively and cannot image not knowing what they were.
I learned Java in college and did two (2) projects in Python during that time and now I'm a Python dev. It's a phenomenally easy language to pick up with any experience in another language. I did no tutorials, no videos, I just dove right in and learned as I went. YMMV obviously but it's really not that bad. I can now do Python easier after working in it for 7 months than I did working with Java for 5 years
Definitely not that simple as multiple combinations of numbers add up to 45. You have to check that each value appears once in each set. I think an elegant solution for this comes down to how you structure the game data. You need to be able to quickly index the data along 3 different axes and make sure that each set of 9 values has 9 unique values and no 0s Plenty of ways to do this sloppily, but tough to make super efficient. I'm also a beginner and could definitely find a solution, but it would probably be unbelievably clunky when compared to a seasoned programmer. 
It made the problem extremely easy because any duplicates were immediately ejected.
 board= [...] def check(board, size=9): wanted = set(range(1,size+1)) for row in [board[i*size:(i+1)*size] for x in range(size)]: if set(row) != wanted: return False for column in [[board[x] for x in range(y, size*size, size)] for y in range(size)]: if set(column) != wanted: return False return True 
I wouldn’t even consider having someone do an unpaid project as part of an interview. Sounds abusive.
Yes, my rule is if your function takes more than 1 argument, NAME THEM!
I got my first job without a degree and any other experience and was purely self taught. The trick is to build some real stuff that you can show as a portfolio. Stuff that requires a database, backend code, web and/or app, etc. Once you can do that and feel decent about it you then need to apply to jobs with links to your work and github account with your code. Focus on applying to startups and small companies. They usually don’t have an HR department filtering the resumes coming in. Or, email the hiring manager directly if you can figure out who they are. When I was in your shoes the startups almost always invited me for a phone screen. How long will it take? Depends on you. It took me about two years but that was 20 years ago and I didn’t have access to the wealth of material that is on the internet today. On the other hand, things were a lot simpler back then so maybe it balances out. 
How much time do they give you for something like this?
I just realized it doesn't have to solve just output "Hey guy, you can't just use multiples of the same number here, also this isn't a crossword."
They gave me 5 hours, but I ended up taking 7 or 8 (only got paid for the 5 though, which is fair). They reviewed my code, and then reviewed it again with me to go over my coding process.
Your solution don't check for repertorios in each area (I'm not sure the real name, but the 9 3by 3 squatted that conform the full board. 
Check out dailycodingproblem.com. You can sign up to get an email everyday of a mock “whiteboard” question at a tech interview. If you pay the 9 bucks a month, they also give you the in depth solutions. The questions apparently come from places like Facebook, google, etc.
I'm not sure why you're down-voting reality, but there it is!

Well shoot, that'll also break checking arbitrary size board too.
I've been writing python for 20 years, I've done some insane shit with metaclasses, natural language and semantic data reasoning with it, but I am continually impressed and intimidated by some of the insanely awesome list comprehensions I see people put together and just have to sit there and go "wait, ...what is that \_even doing\_ ?" &amp;#x200B;
I was asked to make a flask application with tight performance requirements. It was to produce a simple number series rapidly on request.

Any idea on pricing yet? I think this would be an excellet show piece for an employer using a dashboard. 
Lot of self taught people in IT
A lot of you alluding to books. What python book do you recommend? 
Could you elaborate? Why would a python call to fork() deadlock?
That's cool. I'm a copywriter by profession and we're expected to write things for free in interviews all the time. This sounds way more in-depth though.
Ah. Cool. Definitely going to check that out. Thanks for the tip.
This is super cool. Thanks. Looking for answers of varying efficiencies sounds like a great way to practice problem solving.
I had 3 days to learn and make "something" in CherryPy. That something is calling a process and terminating it, output called processess as JSON, get info about operating system (mainly ubuntu) and save it to SQLite DB, and stream some request. It was not hard, I picked up CherryPy and did it :).
Data analysis position - they had me join two csv files and then aggregate them using only the standard library. So no pandas, numpy etc. Fun challenge!
But achieving physical security with that machine is not possible, whoever operates the machine can easily do a man in the middle attack still (very easily even: remove the pi and connect a stick, export data on it. Then stick into laptop and alter the data, then connect the pi to the laptop which will turn up as mass storage device as well, copy modified data onto it). At least the one operating the machine must be a trusted person. And he could take care of signing the data (and possibly encrypting it if other parties should be unable to read it). Then where the data gets processed further (feed in as cleartext) there must work also trusted person. Otherwise he could just skip the signature check and even modify the data before he feeds it into the next machine/printer whatever.
I don't use Reddit, I kind of just went here and did that, does karma actually mean something on this site or something
I often find list comprehension is a result of using interactive shell. Easy to test little snippet out to see if it works and then start iteratively building it up into some huge oneliner with list comprehension. You know it works because you've been testing it along the way, but copy paste it over to editor and you realize you just wrote it and already cannot read it.
For what reason would you ever prefix integers in code with a leading zero?
Do they mostly just default to None? Eg my_color = None, wallet_cash = None
I started learning python four weeks ago.I mainly started with you tube videos.First I saw all the lectures from Telusko channel. Trust me it's awesome for beginners who are starting from scratch. I do recommend you to visit the channels like Telusko and Python Programmer. The later is just mind blowing with it's amazing contents. The host has an in depth knowledge of python and implement it with philosophy and psychology. For books I would recommend Think Python by Allen Downey and Automated boring stuffs with python.If you aim to go on Data Science part,let me know I have a pool of good resources with myself that I collected for over a month by researching on different websites and blogs. Hope it helps.
It sounds like Regex problem to me.
Currently working on a companion style script for the new resident evil 2 game. Call it useless all you want, my internet was lagging so I couldn't get a walk through pulled up. currently it tells you the puzzle solutions, Safe/Locker passwords, and list's trophies/achievements and their respective values, in a nice interactive menu. Oh, and i "pretty'd" it up with color! 
They had me recreate the zip function. 
1 day. I just followed the [online tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
Can I ask how much the position was paying? Would be good to get an idea of the salary for this level of skill

I had to make a simple GUI in Qt for display and functionality to process data in a specific format. In this test case it was an ascii file with both key value pairs and a matrix like data. They asked me how long would it take me, and I said 2 days. I spent 1 and a half day looking into and learning about Qt and dealing with the GUI, and then took half a day writing a parser and the rest for the data. Now I don't touch any GUI stuff, but deal with signal/data processing and like it that way.

Thanks for all your help as a complete newbie this has been more than helpful! My journey in coding will start today!

Take a look at `functools.singledispatch` which gives you method overloading based on the first argument like you said. from functools import singledispatch @singledispatch def foo(x, *args): return max(x) @foo.register def _(x: numpy.ndarray, *args): return x.max() Silly example, but you get the gist. But for anyone who doesn’t, the first function defines a method `foo` which simply returns the maximum value of whatever `x` is. The second one registers another method also called `foo` which is called if and only if you call `foo()` with a `numpy.ndarray` object. `ndarray` objects have a built in `max` method so the second function just calls that one instead. Any other input will be dispatched to the first method. You can have as many dispatch methods as you want limited only by however many classes/types you can or want to define. So you could have a special one for `int` objects, or a custom `Duck` class, and so on. It’s essentially equivalent to writing def foo(x, *args): if isinstance(x, numpy.ndarray): return x.max() return max(x) Or def foo(x, *args): try: return x.max() except AttributeError: return max(x)
What kind of database do you need? Databases vary by whether they persist their data between shutdowns or not, they also vary by the strategy they use to deal with multiple queries issued at the same time, they also vary by the strategy they use to display the data you asked them to save, they also differ in terms of how much structure you can represent in the data that you save. For example, SQLite mentioned here, may be configured to either persist its data between shutdowns or not, it is not safe for concurrent access, it guarantees that if a transaction storing data succeeded, then all queries following it that access the data stored in that transaction will see the data stored. You can store relational data, but it's hard or even impossible to manipulate the metadata. Another example: S3 will always persist your data (cannot be used in-memory), can be used concurrently, but does not guarantee that if a transaction that wrote data succeeded, later reads will return the stored data. It has probably the most simple structure: just keys and values.
Lxml is more Low-level library, and BeautifulSoup uses it under the hood. So lxml is faster, but BeautifulSoup is easier to use. Selenium is a fully functional programmable web browser. So it can execute JS code, make screenshots an other things, that Requests and BeautifulSoup can't. Selenium is heavy and slow in comparison with Requests and BeautifulSoup, but you can use "headless" browsers like PhantomJS instead (the same like Selenium, just without GUI)

Im 3 weeks into learning python, is it a bad sign that i literally dont understand any of the comments on this thread? All of these problems seem pretty absurd to solve. I cant even comprehend how you would formulate these. 
Start just doing some free online courses in for example codecademy just to have a feel how the language looks like. After that you should find a small project to just work on, and when you get stuck you just go and read on stackexchange what people are recommending. I wouldn't recommend going page to page when reading the book, read the chapters you need the most at that moment.

I would suggest checking out anaconda rather then doing it manually. If it is for data science in general you are looking to do. https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Yes and no. No, coz you are only 3 weeks in, and if you don't have any prior coding experience, it's a little gratting. You should start and try to solve the Sudoku and Fibonachi one, they are pretty simple and good show that you understand the basics. Yes if you have an extensive background in other languages. 
You don’t “have python 3.7” you have **a** python 3.7 (interpreter). The stress is on the “a” because you can easily have multiple. Lots of Linux systems for example come with 2.7 as the default because that’s just what the system was built with. You could then install 3.7, but the system wouldn’t “know” about it unless you explicitly did something to tell it so, and even then, you don’t want to overwrite the system default because then everything will probably break. So most likely, you’re getting errors because you’re pip installing to one “interpreter” while trying to use a different one. But we don’t know because we don’t know what os you’re using, how you installed python, or the actual error messages are.

If you mean the cli tool or Yubico Authenticator, then yes i use them at the moment. I want to build something that fetches credentials from an api (which has 2fa) without relying on other tools. &amp;#x200B;
I tried a few variations of yubi.challenge\_response, with and without slot parameter. I think the main issue here is that i do not really understand how the yubikey works, because it seems that i do not seem to use any slots. If i set the Yubico Authenticator to read from slot 1 and 2, there are no numbers showing. The TOTP mechanism seems to be something different.
I feel like there’s a miscommunication/misunderstanding here. You seem to be talking about defining functions, while I *think* the op is talking about calling functions. If I have a method say def pay_person(person, amount, when=None): ... This tells me that I need both a `person` person to pay and an `amount` to pay, but that i can optionally schedule it if I wanted, or do it immediately if not (when `when==None`). It makes to me no sense to define the signature like how you’re saying, eg def pay_person(person=None, amount=None, when=None): ... Because it makes no sense to call this function to pay someone, without the “someone” and the amount. However, when I actually call this function it’s more easily readable if I do pay_person(“Alice”, amount=“69.69”) Rather than pay_person(“Alice”, “69.69”) In this very simple example it’s pretty clear what each argument here is for, but for less simple answers it saves a bit of time trying to figure out what the hell the second argument is specifying. In your example, if you wrote the function you should define “my_color” to be a sane default, as long as it’s optional. If it’s not optional than it shouldn’t be a keyword argument. When you *call* it it might be easier to understand if you explicitly say “my_color=whatever”. Just in case you didn’t know you *can* use keyword=value in function calls even if the function doesn’t have keyword arguments. def foo(x, y): ... Can be called in any of the ways: foo(1, 2) foo(1, y=2) foo(x=1, y=2) foo(y=2, x=1) foo(**dict(x=1, y=2)) foo(*(1, 2)) In all cases x = 1 and y = 2, even if it’s out of order, even though I don’t have keyword arguments in the definition of foo.
and by strongly typed you mean statically typed? Python is strongly typed.
Thankfully in this age and in this industry hard experience earns you more than any degree I ever encountered in my almost 20 years of work experience. I met some clever people who had shiney diplomas under their belt with zero experience and no willingness to learn or care about this craft. I met some highly intelligent people with whom I work with who turned out to flunk out of school because they simply had no desire to sit through all that crap. They had a singular purpose and they achived it through hard work and self teaching. They had an insane amount of knowledge under their belt, were very humble about it and loved what they were doing with full heart. I cannot press this matter strongly enough. Be passionet about your work. Built stuff that you can show, concerete things from which you can learn and gather experience and be humble and respect this craft. You will do just fine. I promise you that. The jobs that **require** you to have a degree are probably not worth your attention. However always know that if you are a fluke that will eventually be found out. If you have a degree or not. 
unkz said they wouldn't consider having them do an unpaid project.
 Yes or No? 
Having applied for exactly 0 Python jobs, I would have to trust you on this. Thanks for the advice. 
Use numpy. You could write a more efficient algorithm, from a complexity standpoint but if mine runs 500x faster, then I’ll take mine.
Have you try with pip3 command? 
&gt; It’s reassuring to know people without degrees can still land jobs. Thanks for the input! Same here. I have a half assed degree which is kind of like a technical something something. I almost flunked out. :D I hated school. I hated being boxed in and I hated being told what to learn. However, don't make a mistake that that means I know nothing and don't want to learn. Quite the opposite. I love learning. I love learning what I want to learn. :) I read books, write code, look for project to participate in every day. I love math, I do it on my own, it's fun to solve equations when no-one is screaming at you or scrutinizes you because of your writing, or how they can't read your number. :D I love solving puzzles at my own pace. Don't be afraid. Be confident. If you love this craft, if you like doing it, learning it, prospare in it, you will accomplish great things. Don't be daunted by the amount of stuff that is out there... You'll eventually catch up. :) And most important, people may seem better than you when you first encounter a senior programmer, or a senior whatever, but just remember this... They just have more years and tried more than you did. It's not that they are more intelligent or that they happened to have a degree in something ( unless the person is a genius. :DD ), it's experience and time. But maybe MOST importantly it's trying and doing it. Get your hands dirty. That is the single most best thing you can do to yourself. Do it. This isn't just a nike ripoff. Actually do it. Find a project. Try replicating it. Find an RFC. Try implementing it. A lot of times and RFC has sample code in it to better under what it is about. ( this might be later on though when you wrote small programs already ). There a gazillion projects out there on Github. Join one. :) Join four. :D And don't be afraid to talk to people. People generally like other people who want to learn are eager and have good demeanor. So.... Go. And have fun. :) And good luck to you! 
Wasn't me but in a similar experience I was at home and could use any resources available. Unpaid though. 
 all([sorted(mat[x]) == list(range(1, 10)) and sorted(zip(*mat)[x]) == list(range(1, 10) for x in range(3)])
Did you check path ? And can you show me full what error u get ?
My longest functions get up to 20 or so arguments. They’re almost entirely GUI interface functions. Separate visualization from analysis. In my classes and regular functions, 5 is probably at the high end.
Something like that doesn't need pandas or numpy though
Have you tried reinstalling Python (or repair)? Python may not start at all if you have not installed the necessary Microsoft Visual C++. But in this case an error message usually appears.
So one task was such: &amp;#x200B; &gt;\# # Write a reverse order method, omitting the list of characters from the string passed as a parameter. &gt; &gt;\# # Chars from the list must remain in their places, others should be placed in the reverse order. &gt; &gt;\# # Solution should be optimal in terms of memory consumption and performance &gt; &gt;\# # For example &gt; &gt;\# # Input: "123456", Chars to be skipped "13", output: "163542" &gt; &gt;\# # Input: "24" Output: "625431" &gt; &gt;\# # Input: "12,34,56", Chars: ",." -&gt; "65,43,21" &gt; &gt;\# # Input: "12,34.56", Chars: ",." -&gt; "65,43.21" &gt; &gt;\# # Propose and implement a set of tests (at least 5 tests) that prove the correct operation of the function &gt; &gt;\# # as the final result, the main function should run a set of tests and check whether the tests were successful or not &amp;#x200B;
I keep rewriting some particularly slow block of code. I get 5x speed ups and then start adding features back. At that point, it’s a crapshoot if I get any speed up. I’ll take 5%.
I agree with this comment. But I think that in your case the language on which your tools are built are not that relevant. If you want a system that will allow you more customization and flexibility, like defining your own content types, you could consider Lektor.
 def is_solved(mat): return all([sorted(mat[x]) == list(range(1, 10)) and sorted(list(zip(*mat))[x]) == list(range(1, 10)) for x in range(10)]) 
Any chance the interviewers were not programmers? That's the only way not knowing what a set was would make sense to me.
Alright I gave it a shot. Also another note `re.findall` and `re.finditer` are not typically used but do come in handy once in a while. Regarding groups they are a way for you to access the results. `result.group(0)` is the full match, `result.group(1)` is the first group and so on. There are also named groups which I haven't used but can come in handy I guess if you have lots of groups. The explanation for `re.findall` and `re.finditer`is in code form. Let me know if you have any questions. # in this example, we will use regex to find the first word of each sentence import re RE_FIRST_WORD = r'(?&lt;=\. )([A-Z])[a-z]*([a-z])' INPUT = ( 'The strip developed a series of formulas that ran over its course to facilitate ' 'a wide range of stories. The earlier strips relied on a formula by which Daddy Warbucks ' 'is called away on business and through a variety of contrivances, Annie is cast out of the ' 'Warbucks mansion, usually by her enemy, the nasty Mrs. Warbucks. Annie then wanders the ' 'countryside and has adventures meeting and helping new people in their daily struggles. ' 'Early stories dealt with political corruption, criminal gangs and corrupt institutions, ' 'which Annie would confront. Annie ultimately would encounter troubles with the villain, ' 'who would be vanquished by the returning Daddy Warbucks. Annie and Daddy would then be ' 'reunited, at which point, after several weeks, the formula would play out again. In the ' 'series, each strip represented a single day in the life of the characters. This device ' 'was dropped by the end of the \'20s. ' ) results_1 = re.finditer(RE_FIRST_WORD, INPUT) # get an iterator back containing all the results print('Listing the first word of each sentence:') for i, result in enumerate(results_1): print('Word {}'.format(i)) print('\tFull word:', result.group(0)) print('\tFirst letter:', result.group(1)) print('\tLast letter:', result.group(2)) results_2 = re.findall(RE_FIRST_WORD, INPUT) # you get a list back containing the results # since we are using groups, we will not get back a list of the first words, instead we will # get a list of groups (in our case group 1 is the first letter, group 2 is the last letter) print(results_2) 
Did they really, really not know, or did they just seem to not know because they asked you about it? (I.e., could that have been part of the interview?)
I wrote a log file parser to find and return the top 10 recurring ip addresses. 
When we hire we don't usually use a coding challenge, but a \_review\_ challenge. I take the initial early commits of one of our web-applications, with mostly being the backend part (ie, data model and utilities) with some initial roughness (variables not perfectly named, all comments stripped out, and some code organization problems that wouldn't pass in our organization). I give it to them on paper, syntax highlighted, etc. have them read it, take their time, and then we have a long discussion about it while they review the code. What catches their eye as being off? ( Inconsistent params to similar-looking functions? Names of SQL fields, etc. etc.) What does the code do, can they explain \_why\_ this code exists as it does? What does the web-app do? explain how the data-model will be used by the views/Frontend based on this. How would you suggest refactoring it? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Because you'll spend at least as much time reviewing peoples changes as you will do changing things, and you'll spend more time reading code than writing code, I find your reading comprehension and ability to formulate critique to be the important parts. &amp;#x200B; You don't need to be an excellent coder to be an \_amazing\_ addition to a team, a good \_reviewer\_ and communicator are \_far\_ more important in my opinion. &amp;#x200B; 
This is actually super helpful advice. Thank you.
Why would anybody need that?
forgot there is another trick :) You can further avoid the hard limit by keeping your Python compressed all the time, by using the ZIP importer. So your deployment package becomes a ZIP within a ZIP. That'd be a pain to setup, but it's worth keeping in mind
I'm not sure what you need but you may check [jsonstore](https://www.jsonstore.io/). At PyPI you can find one or two Python libraries that support it but it's dead simple to use.
I may be missing something but don't see how this would work. It looks like it just checks that every value entered is between 1 and 9. Perhaps testing that every row and column adds up to 45 would improve this. Alternitivly using sets to deduplicate and checking the length of the set is 9 would work.
5 in every box is a solution then
Look into RAKE. https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/

"If" is not a proper statement in Python, it's "if" (all lowercase).
Im not sure about this, havent used phyton for a while. But shouldnt you first define what type of data your result is?
Thaaaanks! &lt;3
Row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45 Adds up to 45, doesn't help. Binary shifting is nice, fast and you need to do it just once.

 A tkinter-GUI toolbox for my work colleagues. It will collect a bunch of network controls, uart comms and harware control lines into one place. This should reduce time and increase efficiency within the product development. Should also get the non-techy people on board with better workflows and automation. &lt;&lt; all good for the company. Spending more time python programming &lt;&lt; all great for me. 
Python is dynamically typed, so no \^\^
I didn't have to, I just talked about previous projects and whiteboarded some system design (ETL and db stuff). This was for a senior data engineering position.
This is how technical interviews or challenges should be conducted. I suppose it highlights the applicant's: - knowledge and experience dealing with such apps - coding style - eye for not obvious details like race condition or so - even you could gather if his review attitude would work well with the team. 
This sounds more like a psychology or linguistics question
I think you're better off with youtube tutorials. I've tried 2 out of these 3 books and hated both of them. 
I can't post screenshots, but I maintain a 250k line Tcl/Tk project that's famed (internally) for it's nice UI. Tkinter = Tk + Python. You don't have to "stretch" Tkinter to make a good GUI, you just have to learn how to use it.

You're not going to mention that using Pyqt means paying a ludicrous sum for a license or being forced into GPL?
This absolute madman is trying to break the planet.
It also gives the interviewer an idea about: - Ability to understand SQL (even in ORM/Object form / relationships) - Experience with names of SQL columns (should every table have an `id` column or an `table_id` column? Different schools, etc.) - Ability to deduct function from data model Can you take a look at a data-model and draw conclusions of how the application is intended to work? - Ability to communicate opinions / thoughts / questions Also, here's the code sample I've been using for a while: [Datamodel](https://gist.github.com/Spindel/7ccd43b1f2f79f1bb23c70920f75cec4) 
I wrote a function that returned how many new letters needed to be added to the end of a string to make it a palindrome. So an actual palindrome returned 0, something like "abcd" returned 3 (add "cba" and it's a palindrome), and "bcada" returned 2 (just add "cb" and it's "bcabacb", which is a palindrome). It helped that I conceptually broke down the problem so that I really just had to return the index at which the substring from that index to the end makes a palindrome. Turning the problem on its head really seemed to impress. 
With my brief experience with it, it seemed like is own language in the sense that your whole programs visuals had to be through tkinter (eg. var = input("") but with tkinter var = entry("") which is then displayed differently) Any basic advice?
Any GUI will require that all the "visuals" are through it. My advice is to write some sample programs. And learn the different packers. And use frames to nest things so they group and resize correctly.
Didn't get the position. But they had me create weather forecaster using the Forecastio API. The program was to pull and parse data from a JSON file and create a weather report for each location for the next 24 hours, the next 3 days, then the next week. It was then to put that data into another JSON file. Then after that the wanted to recreate it using OOP
Congratuations on your CS university project. Your next project should be an AI that checks to see if users actually attached an attachment when they said they did. If testing is offered as a course, I recommend it highly.
I too always solve 9*9 Sudoku by filling in every entry with the number 5. /r/protips 
Definitely curious to check it out!
In the case of l79 init, it is not only unnecessary, depending of what Base does it is very likely a bug because its __init__ is never called, so you miss any potential trickery which is usual in ORMs. (You probably don't miss it because of some higher level metaclass trickery, but for me is a red light to completely override init wihout at least a comment indicating that we really really mean to do that).

Eventually you have to be an autodidact in this industry anyway. IT is always changing. The whole mindset of learning a language and be done with that for your career would be the wrong attitude to begin with. If you are not interested in how stuff works, don't even get started. If you are interested it's not that hard to keep learning and improving. Degrees will tell you almost nothing about the competence of a programmer. It's just an easy shortcut for HR, because evaluating whether somebody is actually a good developer is a non-trivial thing. If you have trouble finding work start contributing to an open source project. That provides you with real experience and gives you something meaningful to point to.
hey i am trying to learn and work with data science, could yo share them with me please
Ayup, that's not the _only_ bug here, but one of them. And most of those bugs aren't there to "catch you" by being quirky on purpose, but rather because that's the way the code actually looked at one point through development. In the case of SQLAlchemy, it doesn't call __init__ on creating the objects from DB, but they get called when you create them manually, so that's okay [in this case](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/constructors.html). But it's definitely a code smell and something quirky. 
Will you please come Pm? 
I had a somewhat similar experience for a contractor position. Was offered a one-month paid trial on the basis that I had to successfully review their code-base and architecture, then discuss with stakeholders (basically tech lead and the client's PO) regarding improvements, all while aligning with the feature requests and product concept. Passed with flying colors, but the project was canned a few months later - for the better in my case since I was immediately offered another higher-paying project. Honestly being an amazing coder is the least I look upon myself and my colleagues. Being able to communicate, understand (and specially debate) feature requests and _actually_ review the code (and not just check if it meet's the AC's) is *far* more important than doing cryptic pythonic list comprehensions (even though these are impressive from a technical perspective!). 
They made me ingest a massive weather dataset and process it as part of a forecasting system. I don't work there anymore, but it was a good challenge. 
I was hired as a java dev, did my code test in java, had literally never done hello world in python. During the interview they asked me off hand if I knew any python, and unusually I was honest and said no. It's nearly 2 years later, and I've been working exclusively in python since my second week. 
I have been using PythonAnywhere for over a year now. Started with free and have gradually upgraded using the custom plan since then. I always used to use VPS's before for a bit of on-line coding because I like the control, but to be honest, the environment you get with PA is just perfect for python development and hosting and it is SOLID, I mean these guys are ultra obsessive about not tweaking anything unless it has been tested to death. Support and stability is the reason I stay with PA to be honest. I did try deploying my main project to GCP using the free credits but it became clear very quickly that it would be much more expensive to do that but on balance that is not my main concern. If I have one gripe with PA, which for me is a biggy, it is that you have to connect remotely to your database using SSH which makes it so slow as to be unusable. This means I will have to move on from PA at some point but I am not looking forward to that day. &amp;#x200B;
I was interviewing for a bioinformatics position. The job involved working with HIV gene sequence data, to look at how the viral RNA evolves over time (i.e. analyzing and comparing blood samples taken from the patient at regular intervals to see how their HIV changes). As a test, they gave me some data in a weird format that I had never seen and a description of the format, and they asked that I parse it using whatever tools I needed (numpy, pandas, etc). Then they needed me to clean the data - remove some NaNs, fix some broken parts, find duplicates, etc. Then they gave me some background about how some common calculations are performed on this kind of data, and they asked me to perform a specific analysis of the data and plot the results in an informative and clear way. They gave all of this to me as a take-home challenge and there was no restriction on what kinds of resources I'd need to complete it. They offered me the position, but I turned it down because in the mean time I got a different job that payed much more. The second job was working for a friend/colleague who knew my abilities, so it didn't involve any coding assessment.
Do it in an open notebook. !pip install jupyterthemes Are you not using anaconda with jupyter? If so run the conda install command for jupyter themes
&gt; why some employers seem to care so much about which tech stacks you know Because when a company starts a project, it picks a set of tools it thinks is best for the job. Then they write thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code using those tools. A new person who isn't familiar with those tools will suffer from productivity losses. Furthermore, once you've got *n* thousand lines of mission critical Java code, it becomes prohibitively expensive to rewrite it into Python, or Node, or whatever. Rewrites do happen, but generally not because they hire someone new with "big ideas". They stick with it until it starts costing them more than it makes.
Even if its pseudo code, why have hyphens in the names? Kind of confusing.
That's a contract not an interview. But I think its a better way to see if you're a good fit for the work and if you like the company and how they do things.
I've been interviewing candidates for a Python job recently, and some of the best haven't touched Python before. Good problem-solving and communication skills are a lot harder to teach than Python is. 
It doesn't work inside jupyter, I get : 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. And no, I do not use anaconda. My issue is activating the theme, the package is installed fine with pip, but I can't access the package at all with the commands on the github page.
For future reference, r/learnpython is a better place to post this kind of thing.

Where can I learn how to do this? Every python course I've taken just does mind numbingly basic intro to python. How the hell do you actually hook up to an sms process?

That's a good point but I still think it is foolish to look for "X developer with n years of experience". Like I said the foundations are the same, even if you find yourself looking at some extraneous java code that you never saw before I'll bet somewhere in there, there is an explanation based on some foundational principle. Web workers and goroutines are very similar to each other. There are differences yes, but knowing that they both employ similar concepts in their implementation allows you to understand one or the other with ease. I think it is much better to know the how of things rather than just X or Y language and technology. They all have a basis on the foundations and understanding them is the key to being able to move from technology to technology with ease. 
What exactly is thevproblem with your solution?
The problem is that the Timer does not know anything about the type of the \`interface\` field. Thus, there is no way to ensure type safety. From timer's point of view, the interface is simply an object.
You're completely right! But you also have to keep in mind that a business is...well, a business. They have to make money, and avoid making decisions that are costly in the long term. As a developer with 15 years experience in Python and Go, I could almost certainly jump into a Java codebase and be "adequate" within a month or two. Buuuut to a hiring manager ( especially because they generally lack first hand technical knowledge ), there's no guarantee of that. A bad programmer ( a dumb one, or one with a shitty attitude ) could very well just be a perpetual albatross around the neck of the team, even if they've been "coding" for 30 years. Basically, it's a shitty situation that can only be solved by making non-technical staff ( hiring managers ) have technical experience, which again doesn't make much budget sense. It sucks. I don't have any good answers. I haven't been able to get hired for writing code in eight years. Soo...I don't think I have a pithy closer for this one.
Mmm youre over thinking this probably. OP just wants to get the job done with whatever arbitrary rules that are in place I think. 
The initial error was that the command 'jt' was not found, but I have now added python/scripts to the PATH variables and now it works properly, thanks.
This gave me so much insights and depth of data analysis about the fields and aspects where it can be applied to. Being a painter and poet myself, I really appreciate your work. Do share such things regularly. 
etkz said that xrendan says it was a paid interview
Damn I have no idea what any of those things are. There's always so much more to learn.
I had 2: (1) Here's a list \[1, 5, 10, 25\]. This list represents the value of coins. If I give you a number, whats the smallest number of coins you can use to have them add up to the number I gave you. What if the list is generic rather than \[1,5,10,25\]? This did address the skills I need for my job but indirectly. The goal was to see (a) What my thought process is (b) Are you OK with solving a problem using brute force? (c) Once you right code that works, are you able to judge if it will work in cases other than the one you've been given? I'd say ability to solve problems and decide if the code works given changing project definitions is definitely something I need to be able to do on any given day. &amp;#x200B; (2) Here's what the lines in a log file look like. I want to make a histogram based off of two pieces of information per line. There are billions of lines of log. How would you do it? Again, not directly something I personally do (though a member of my team does so I guess it could potentially become a job of mine) but it was a lot of seeing if I break things down into multiple methods, is the code I write incredibly fragile, when I'm working through the problem am I thinking about edge cases or any potential issues the code could run into? &amp;#x200B; Both also involved seeing how open to other suggestions I was and how I responded to criticisms of my solution. Not that they were mean, but things like "Well this code works in this situation, but if I give you an input of (nonsensical value for the problem) it doesn't work?" and seeing if I got defensive or if I said "Yeah I can see how this needs more QA. I think if I had more time I'd do \_\_\_\_\_." or "I think that shouldn't be a problem because validation should have occurred before getting to this method." Stuff like that. I feel like very rarely have I been given problems that are 1-1 what I'm going to be doing and a lot more "Hey, can you think your way through a problem and work with others?" 
Basically A random sampling of leetcode algorithms problems
Yeah, I guess it is. Well, I know the big 5 tech companies hire people this way. My experience so far has been with Amazon. They don't care what language you use as long as you can prove you know your CS stuff. I think the same is true of the other 4. I don't know if their hiring manager have tech skills, I suspect they probably do or at least they know something. I would like to get into Google one day, hopefully this is the way they do things whenever it is that I might find myself looking for a job there.

Nice! 
You could create a new super class for Interface and include an alert implementation which raises NotImplementedError and insert it into timer.py. But I don't know what difference if would make in reality. That way you could check the type before calling alert if you want to enforce type safety.
You can use an SMS gateway. In op's case likely https://www.twilio.com/sms
I had a take-home of writing a small Django app (user profile CRUD + API). In the end they dismissed it and hired me in a different position (bioinformatician rather than backend developer)

Yes, but it didn't work untill I added /scripts to PATH
Here the right thing to do is to not have a `Timer.alert` and to just let `Interface.run` call `alert` when `Timer.run` finishes. But this is clearly a contrived example, so maybe that doesn't always work in real code. 
I can currently perform data analysis in SAS and SQL and looking to go down the data science path. Your book recommendation in this area would be great. 
I don’t get why not just check? Exceptions are a good way to pop your stack needlessly when an if statement would have sufficed.
Ain't no thing. This dude posted another example here a while ago: https://github.com/Jalen-G/Morning-Weather/tree/master The code sends an SMS weather report.
[Data Interview Qs](https://www.interviewqs.com/) is similar and sends python/data science/database questions a few times a week.
Sure, but I highly doubt an interview panel will want you to use something like numpy. The point is to assess how well you can walk through the problem on your own.
If you are already familiar with python, I would suggest you to go through "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas. This book is to the point and a great way to start the exploration of this vast field of data science. You will get hooked up in minutes while reading. As being Data scientist is not all about coding and programming, you will need some comfortable hands in mathematics and statistics too. For beginning I would strongly recommend you to start with "An introduction to statistical learning by Gereth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. You can even check out the online course based on this book taught by Tibshirani on the Stanford University page. It's all free!. Hope it helps for initiation. If you have any doubts, feel free to contact me. Happy to help, as it's also a part of learning. 
with all respect, I think $1k for course is too much for me :)
The python version you are using doesn’t have pip installed or is name pip3. When you call pip it’s pointing at the system version that comes with the os (most likely). Look at an environment manager like pyenv to make this easier. Or conda, but there is a lot going on behind the scenes with that which I’ve heard confusion about too. 
You're three weeks in. Cut yourself some slack. Then go do the [Pyramid Tutorial](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/quick_tutorial/) and give it a whirl. When you do the tutorial, don't copy-paste code, but _type_ it all in, that way you'll make mistakes, and fix mistakes. And it's far more important for learning. After that, come back and read my [interview example](https://gist.github.com/Spindel/7ccd43b1f2f79f1bb23c70920f75cec4) and see if you can answer the questions and see anything wrong with it. 
My salary is around $4500 USD / mo. I honestly don't know whether or not that's fair for what I do. Some days I think I'm over laid and some days I think I'm underpaid. It also depend on where you live.

Yes, I wouldn't have been able to do it without using Google. 60% of my day to day is reading documentation, so it wouldn't have been representative otherwise.
Manager A: We need to build about 10 microservices but we don't have budget for another head. Manager B: Post a job opening and pay applicants to write you example code. We own the code because it's paid and and we get the microservices on the cheap. Manager A: Can we do that? Manager B: Hold my beer.
You own the rights to what you wrote for the interview because it wasn't paid (unless you signed them away). In this case, the interviewer owns the code since it was payed. Depending on what was payed, it's not a bad way to get a bunch of microservices written for the cost of a code review and lunch.
👆🏼this is a funnier version of what I was thinking when I read about his interview 
&gt;\[sqlite\] is not safe for concurrent access No, it is safe. What it does is: "When any process wants to write, it must lock the entire database file for the duration of its update. " which is suboptimal but efficient enough for its purpose. But maybe I misread your sentence. In that case sorry.
&gt; over laid noice ;)
Lol, you're not wrong; it's definitely a risk to this kind of format. I'm not sure if the company actually owns the code though or if I still do; not that it really matters to me.
you are already dealing with (relatively small) numbers, so there is not much point in hashing. I would add the numbers to a set since they should be unique, but otherwise I don't see anything in your initial design that sounds fundamentally problematic.
Remember that a lot of the hiring equation, especially for junior devs, is not knowledge but cultural fit and ability/willingness to learn. They want to know if they can stand you as a person and if you can grow into the role. Good luck.
You're 100% right. I was facing more or less a deadline for it. I got approval for to share a little more. I work for server manufacturer, and I do hardware/firmware QA(mostly TTM sequence testing, and fixing bugs). The servers I'm setting these sessions for are my lab servers. There are like 250 of them and they periodically get wiped and reinitialized. So keys are not really an option, but they are scripted to be reinitialized with the same authentication information. So that is why I'm attacking it like this. My airlocked VM was forced changed to windows and now I'm having to rewrite a bunch of old scripts. I understand its frustrating, and I don't want to come off as not being appreciative of community help here. For I really do, which is why I posted :D. Shoulda done it in the proper reddit though. That one is one me. 
I was hired as a software engineer at a small-ish company (50-60 employees) and I was never actually tested to see if I knew how to code. The boss is a little older and doesn't care much for details, so maybe that's why, but I showed him my short but impressive (at least to him) portfolio. All he seemed to need to know is that I could code and I was good. Maybe my portfolio is worth mentioning. I created 2 programs -- 1. The first one was a program that let you create macros quickly and easily to automate or semi-automate tasks. I used this one to speed up the cataloging of inventory by weeks-months 2. A program where when you take a picture of an inventory item it automatically cuts and crops the object onto a white background. This helped us identify parts MUCH quicker when sorting through almost 20,000 parts. Both have a theme of optimizing for efficiency, so I tried to play that angle up.
I'll take a look, I saw someone mention fabric, but I'm working with an airlocked VM so getting some modules installed is shitty :/ 
Trust me if I could use keys I would be. The servers are lab systems that get wiped and reinitialized often. But inits are scripted to have the same auth info. They are on a closed network so security for these logins, plus with the nature of the servers makes it not a major concern. I super frustrating I know. 
&gt; there is not much point in hashing. I would add the numbers to a set Which uses the interpreter's existing hashing implementation.
Seems a bit complex. Basically all you need is a helper function, like `is_palindrome`, that tests a string in a one-liner: `return string == reversed(string)`. Then, you can do this: for idx, _ in enumerate(the_string): if is_palindrome(the_string[idx:]): return idx If the original is a palindrome, it returns 0 (first index). If it gets to the very last letter, the single-char string is a palindrome by definition, so it returns that index. If you want to also print the resulting palindrome, I'd return a tuple: `(idx, reversed(the_string[:idx]))`. That's the substring from the beginning to the index of the first palindrome, reversed, so you can build the new palindrome from the return value.
Ah nice, I did indeed over engineer. Cheers
There's always more to learn than you have time to spend learning it. Part of the trick is to thoroughly research the company before the interview and get a good idea what their existing business focus is. Between that and the req itself you have a general idea of what technologies they'll likely need you to be familiar with. Don't try to be an expert in everything but interviews are like tests, you need to study for them.
Thanks for the help. I'll look into it and maybe drop you a pm. I'm a python beginner! 
Interviewer, and I would totally expect a candidate to use numpy, since we use numpy (and pandas) for our data sets. I'd be looking to see whether the candidate could write a solution that was readable, efficient, idiomatic, and obviously correct. 
You should issue those commands in a shell, not inside the interpreter. If you see three chevrons &gt;&gt;&gt; it means you are inside the interpreter and should type exit() to return to the shell
This would legit give me anxiety. Every time I've tried to play Sudoku I see infinite number of solutions or possibilities until I put it down. 
A 3 day interview? Or was it like, interview homework?
If you were paid, they own the code. Not saying that's what is happening in your case but some company's business practices leave a lot to be desired.
What logs are you looking at? If you are using server logs, then put them into ELK stack or similar.
Job is for backend/Django/Django Rest work. I was given a git code repo and told to implement a new minor feature (~2 hours worth of work). I had to add a new DRF serializer and the API routes to go with it. What was *not* explicitly stated was I was expected to write tests for it, fix the current failing tests and fix any linting errors. All of which was already set up for the project and I, as the developer, was suppose to detect that and know to just do it. 
The If was a simple syntax error. But your code should also be improved by replacing your list of ifs into a for loop. 
Validating whether a given solution to a puzzle is correct is much easier than solving the puzzle.

I really like ‘pathlib‘, which was added to the standard library in Python 3.4, for dealing with filepathes. There at some lower level functionality that isn't in ‘pathlib‘ and so you have to drop back to either ‘os‘ or ‘shutil‘, but that's more than made up for by the ease in which higher level functionality (like exploring the fire system) becomes.
I think your issues are more fundamental that simply trying to avoid a circular dependency. If the Interface class is supposed to represent the UI component, why is it also acting as a controller and invoking the [Timer.run](https://Timer.run)() method? If the Interface's concern is strictly to provide a UI, to the Timer, it really has no business directing the Timer(). I think you'll need a separate function or class/method to perform the orchestration. If the two classes really do need to control each other, then you should perhaps look at adopting a message driven approach to decouple them from each other. If your UI is at all interactive, with UI events triggering state changes, you may need to adopt a message driven approach. [PyMessagebus](https://github.com/DrBenton/pymessagebus) is a fairly simple to use, yet reasonably powerful in-app message bus.
Thanks for your faith in me stranger.
I strongly recommend that boolean arguments be named parameters. It's rare that you can look at a function and know what True or False is indicating.

Are you sure they have an API-endpoint ? Meaning they allow for API calls to request information/data from their system? If not, it's really not possible
I hadn't heard if this until now. This is a GENIUS idea!

Is that true though? Like if I'm a photographer, and I take some pictures for a client, the client doesn't own the pictures, they just own a copy of them unless you specifically transfer over your rights to them. Somethibg that I never did for my code. I definitely agree with you that some companies are sketchy with what they do though.

AFAIK the designer spits out a `.ui` file. If pyqt5 is available on Python 3.7, then you should be able to use it. Also, for questions like these, r/learnpython is better suited.
Python really has great support for old versions. Between these carefully planned releases and the relative ease of installing a Python interpreter under a venv, it's super friendly for old code.
* In python, you cannot control the existence of other threads, they can be created by all sorts of libraries depending on the phase of the moon. * Other threads may lock some libc mutex, which remains locked after `fork`. * The only thread that exists after `fork` may attempt to lock that mutex, and wait forever. In C, you can guarantee that you only call `async-signal-safe` functions between the `fork` and the `exec` or `exit`, which avoids the possibility of attempting to lock a mutex.
Why is that? I have heard other people say this and generally the reason has been something like, "I have lots of years of experience, and this is insulting to make me do this trivial problem". Which I understand to a certain extent, since I have been programming for 30 years. But at the same time, there is a shocking amount of people I have found who has an extensive resume who cannot code trivial problems in a short time. So I look at these problems as a simple filter. For someone who knows what they are doing, these problems take hardly any time at all and it is not really too inconvenient, and for the person hiring it weeds out posers. In fact sometimes, it is a time to shine. I once took an interview test that had automated unit tests, some that I could run as I coded and some hidden ones that were run after I submitted my final answer. Well, one of the hidden ones failed. The interviewer was surprised because I had done so well in everything else. Then he looked closer and found that he had not thought of edge case that I was properly handling and that his test had not considered. 
You are quite correct. I don't know how that slipped through.
QT official support of PySide2 (over PyQt5) is pretty recent if I remember correctly. They'll probably update the docs soon enough! 
if you live on one of the US coasts in a major city than you're under paid. If not I'd say that's fair.
Dedupe is what I had in mind too. You could parse our the 3x3 boxes to make the format easier to assess, and dedupe for rows and columns and check if length = 9. Also check that all numbers are between 1 and 9. It would work, but it’s not elegant. Haha
PySide2 is extremely new. My guess is that they haven't gotten the documentation written just yet. I haven't found it super hard to work with though - their API is meant to be compatible with the one PyQt5 provides, and a decent IDE is able to autocomplete most of it anyways. There are some guides and articles in the documentation that include python examples too - including one that uses signals and slots, if I'm not mistaken. 
For some reason spell-checkers don't seem to catch it even though it's an *extremely* rare case where payed is the correct choice. I blame the machines!
I hope they gave you the rules to Sodoku :) . I've never played it. Still, validating a solution should be much less complex than building the actual solution. 
Can confirm, as I’m using that combo right now. 
People get scared of numpy because they think it’s hard. It takes practice to learn how to vectorize your code and it fixes one of the biggest problems with python, which is the inability to do computation of large data sets. I don’t care if my coworker got their code of stack overflow. Is it fast and right? Shoot, I don’t even care if it has a small bug.
You're probably not. I thought I was because I couldn't immediately understand the posted solutions. I tried my own and figure dit out after about an hour. https://gist.github.com/Kerbobotat/761f8df923fe7df50e5c805cf6c68c4c#file-sudoku-py Have a read. If you can understand it you can probably code it.
i don't think it's unfair for a company to propose a coding test, and i've even participated in administering them. i think they do serve a purpose in some applications. for me personally, i usually supply enough material that it would be obvious of my skillset. if the company i am applying to has not done the proper background research into me and further wants to give me coding test to get in the door, then i usually chalk it up as a part of their corporate culture. in my experience, this is usually a "bad code smell" moment for me about the company that might hire me. at this point, i am willing to walk away if i think their corporate culture is like that. i feel that is speaks to a lack of review on the part of the interviewer which _for me_ tells a lot about a prospective employer. luckily, i am in a position where i can pick and choose where i want to work. i realize that not everyone is in that position. my current joke is that _if_ i were in an interview and they gave me a coding test i would just write something like: #include &lt;interview.h&gt; reverse_string(some_string); tongue-in-cheek, but you get the idea. to be clear, i am not insulted if a company asks me to take a coding test. i just find it to be an indicator of likely corporate culture that i will not integrate will with.

Interesting. I'm totally talking out of my ass so you would certainly know better. Still, the problem doesn't automatically get solved by throwing numpy at it. Ndarrays won't magically give you the desired output, and you could still write some super janky code using numpy. I have to imagine that as an interviewer asking a question like this, you would care more about *how* the candidate is using his/her tools, whether they be numpy arrays, lists, or something else entirely.
I interview people quite a bit. And typically the questions asked are selected based on the candidates stated experience and ratchet up in difficulty slowly (depending on the position). But, they are usually very open-ended that allows us to work with the candidate and ask questions about their solutions. 
I want to start off by saying, it differs for each company and what the people who come in to interview are willing to do. If you are a large company and well known to the tech industry I would expect a lengthy interview process. With that said, I think some programmers/hiring managers that used to be programmers get a little too carried away. Unless I am interviewing for a tech start-up in the valley or I am competing against the best of the best for a position at a company *like* Google, I am not sitting around for a five hour long interview. Sorry. Unless you are interviewing for a valley company, new to the field, have very little experience or just an "adequate" programmer, - IMO - I would not spend that much time interviewing for a company. Now before all the hiring managers jump on me I have been in I.T. for a while, I have a bunch of open source projects that I contribute to (verifiable on GitHub) and have held many different developer positions (as well as ops positions). If a local company wanted me to sit down and review code for hours and then take several programming problems I would say "no thanks." I am busy, I have a job already and if I am looking for a new one I am not wasting a whole day for each company I interview with. With that said, I have no problem addressing my skills with a test or a code review but I am not interviewing for 3+ hours. Again, just my 2c, take it for what it's worth. 
If they can't assess your skills do you join in a probationary status?

good question, i've never had that happen so i'm not sure. most places i've worked at had some sort of "probationary" period for everyone though, so i would imagine that if i had under-performed i would have heard about it. fwiw, the last 3 positions i held, i was not asked to take a code test. so, it's hasn't come up.

The `all()` method is useful for sure but it does have caveats; every method will be evaluated even if the first returns `False`. It's not a huge problem in a task like this but in some cases of resource expensive conditional tests it might be better to stick with the standard short circuited `if X and Y and Z` which will stop evaluation at the first `False`.
If you’re using Anaconda (which I highly recommend), Windows is absolutely fine, no need for a dedicated Linux install. You‘ll get 99 out of 100 packages you need from the conda repositories. It’s really not so difficult nowadays.
You can compile it yourself with only the modules you need. That would be the best way. 
Solving it is only a case of putting the validator inside a brute force loop. Shouldn't take that long. 
Just use the PyQt5 documentation. Also, use your IDE.
Might be easier use google agendar or similar, is in't?

Well in raspbian with Python 2.7 and 3.5 installed Pip refers to the first one and pip3 to the second one. I know, this is strange but that's what happens to me about twoxweeks ago.

Yeah but that's typical highly inefficient.

I got a great whiteboard question on anagrams. Went something like this: &gt; Write a function that accepts a list of non-numerical strings and finds which ones are anagrams of the others. Returned data can be of whatever type/format you think is appropriate. Stumped the hell out of me. I didn't get it on my own, and floundered through a good chunk of it. I think the only thing that saved me was that I talked through all of my thought processes, which I guess was enough for them. After that they gave me a SQL question that I knocked out of the park (after I got the job I learned that had a big impact on their evaluation as well) Let me know if you'd like to see what I came up with. I have a bunch of notes about it sitting around.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

Hi! Thank you very much. I'd like to share this kind of things! I'll try! Maybe something about poetry?
Brother... You can never be overpaid ;)
Couldn't you just put each row, column, and cell into an array, then loop through each to check there's no repeats? I dunno if this is the most efficient way to do it but it would solve the issue.
Sounds like they were getting candidates to work for them for free.

You assess skills by interviewing. You talk about projects you've completed before, what challenges were faced, etc. 
Pretty sure all of your questions would be answered by your first. Find the API docs and start there, no API is the same so all your other questions / assumptions could be invalid.
Tongue was firmly in my cheek.

I will always be ready to listen anything about poetry. It would be a complete whole new level of using data analysis in poetry.

Applied for Junior Data Analyst role in digital marketing. I was asked to explore two datasets and I sent back an IPython notebook with the analysis.
Python 3.6 is required if you're interested in using Tensorflow -- or the preferred Keras high level library for those just starting out. If you're interested in using the very handy \`dataclasses\` feature of Python 3.7, fear not! Although \`dataclasses\` doesn't come with Python 3.6, it is backwards compatible and can be simply pip installed.
Of course python never really knows that type of anything beforehand, it behaves the same whether you've imported the interface or not. That said if you want to recover intellisense and typecheck in mypy you can use the new annotations design to make some circular imports in 3.7. In general you can do circular imports with the `import foo` style so long as you don't actually access anything from the other during function definition time. So inheriting, constants, and old-style annotations are the main use-cases that run into problems. If you're not on 3.7 you can use `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`to get something of the same effect with ugly string annotations. # modA.py from __future__ import annotations from dataclasses import dataclass import modB @dataclass class ClassA: progenitor: modB.ClassB def speak(self) -&gt; str: return f'comes from {self.progenitor.name}' &amp;nbsp; # modB.py from __future__ import annotations from dataclasses import dataclass import modA @dataclass class ClassB: name: str def create(self) -&gt; modA.ClassA: return modA.ClassA(self) if __name__ == '__main__': gen = ClassB('abc') print(gen.create().speak()) 
Fresh out of college interview (for an associate data engineer position that primarily defines ETL jobs in python/pyspark). They had me go over a bunch of SQL basics, OLTP vs OLAP modeling, a bunch of general AWS knowledge and then did a sort of "Prove it" test where they had me wire an AWS lambda function that pulled a record from the source system, do a minor transformation (fixing a time stamp), and then output to an S3 bucket. Nothing overly hard on the python front and the interview was more of a general "Do you know how to connect/pull information from the systems we have/use the stack we *might use." I should note I'm in the R&amp;D division of that company now, so technologies do change somewhat frequently. They were more so looking for someone with strong cs fundamentals who had a lot of general knowledge about cloud-related things than someone who specifically checked off so lmk e arbitrary list of skills.
That's what I was thinking. It could get pretty tedious adding each package and installation for 30+ computers though. Is there a way to efficiently package this up so its not such a pain to install? what if I need to update those 30+ computers to add on an additional package? Say I realize later I need xlsxwriter for example to be installed on all those computers.
I'm not an expert, but my reflex would be to write a bash script (or python script) that installs the modules you need, and then just execute it. There may be a more efficient method however.
Absolutely not. It a very minor feature and it was not for a junior role. I do not know if you have actually used Django + DRF, but adding a serializer for an existing model and an API view for it is a very minor tasks. It is literally in the tutorial docs on the library. And now that I work here, I can actually see that that repo was in no way reflective of the rest of the code base (which is actually a lot better than the test repo was). 
In python it’s easy to make a dictionary! Just put all the numbers in a dictionary. A dictionary contains a key and value but all you really care about is the key. Put the number as the key and then you can search and check if that key exists when you create a new number. A dictionary has a constant (O(1)) look up time. This will make your script faster if it has to include tons of numbers in the future!

We make every candidate do a project that's about an hour long. It's a test, it's not like they use the results
Is this recursion?
Where do you live, I assume that's pre tax. If it's in the US that seems very underpaid
Exactly, the C++ Docs are one of the best docs I've stumbled upon
Make a requirements.txt file with just what you want and "pip install-r requirements.txt" so your install process will be minimal
good answer, perhaps i misunderstood the question
Interview homework haha. I don't really understand the practice of testing with some hard problems that don't have nothing in common with the job you will do day after day. 
Ah I have seen this method online. Will that work just as well as using conda install? Or is there support for this using conda install? I've heard you could run into installation issues a bit easier if using pip instead of conda. I could be wrong tho. 
Pre-tax, in Canada which has lower salaries than the US but even then I'm not sure how my salary stacks up.
I've been using the C++ docs in lieu of any good PySide documentation. Everything is peachy.
Make a certificate or finish a university :). Web ? Django/Python ? How to show the skill ? Nope. Each one platform or system is different. Python = syntax. Each one employer need a different focus of Python (IS, Web, User apps, Scripts, Database system, Server/Client apps, etc.). There are different programming techniques, other algorithms, different modules of third side... so if you are a Python programmer, you are not the programmer of anything but the language itself (Python syntax). Unfortunately, each company requires specific rankings. Bare in mind you just need to practice as a Python programmer. That's what employers look at.
Sure, but I like making these things as a learning exercise. :)
Gonna practice a little. Then maybe try the CodeCademy Python 3 course. For training.
Is PyQt close enough you can just use it? Sometimes I just look up stuff in regular QT to for the PyQt
Works without the https http://pythontutor.com/
Thing is numpy and pandas are the wrong tool for the job for this problem. Complete overkill, and don't make anything easier. Probably would be a negative impact on performance too. If be surprised if somebody imported them right off the bat. Sort of things I'd like to see would be appropriate use of standard library, pythonic code (e.g. not translated java code, abstracting the iteration), and performance aware (e.g. early exit if it's an obvious failure). ... but everyone is looking for something different. 
... but how does it help solve this problem?
Thousand of person hours figure it out? It's the same api! The translation from c++ examples to python is straightforward. I think you aren't looking for a documentation, you are looking for a tutorial, maybe you just got used to Django documentation which is wonderful but it's not normal to include a complete tutorial in the docs, not even Spring does.
Same as my company. We have a project that's used as a coding testing (albeit this is for data science rather than software engineering). The two aspects that I believe make it a fair deal are: (a) it's been design to take only about 45-75 minutes depending on skill level and (b) it uses an open source dataset that has nothing to do with our company. It's been far more effectively in identifying proper talent in the technical screen phase of the interview process than we ever had with whiteboard testing, making someone do FizzBuzz and an algorithms problem, etc.
You’re fine, conda will know and work with it.
Like others have said already, it is fairly new. On top of that, there isn't much difference between PySide2 and C++ Qt other than the syntax. If you can learn to translate it from C++ its fairly easy to use. wid = new QWidget; this-&gt;setCentralWidget(wid); wid-&gt;setFixedSize(500, 500); The above translates to: wid = Qwidget(None) self.setCentralWidget(wid) wid.setFixedSize(500,500) 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_X
I know projects with hundreds of hours of documentation in them that people complain about because the people writing documentation assume some contextual understanding of the problem. Then they try to document that contextual information, and others complain that the docs are too verbose. 
But the Canadian dollar's value is higher than the usd one, isn't it? 
No. Maybe for about a month during the US financial crisis... But generally no. 
You’ll want to use miniconda (bare bones anaconda install) and then take a look at environments. https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html Basically you’ll set up an environment where you can run your script (pretend like you’d be one of your clients) without any issues. You can conda install most of the things and pip install the rest, or vice versa. It doesn’t really matter. When it works you just export the environment which will create a file that’ll tell conda exactly what to install.

I agree
Just us the standard distribution, install the required packages, export to a requirements.txt file and then in the rest of computers you just do pip install -r requirements.txt
There is, requirements file
It's your taste. Actually there are lot of ways to do a thing in computer world :) And you're talking about unit tests I guess. Here is example: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) Also good reading about why you should do unit tests: [https://quintagroup.com/cms/python/python-unit-testing](https://quintagroup.com/cms/python/python-unit-testing) First, you need to chose what do you want to do, as you can do a lot of things with python and your needs always will be related with your project. Today it could be Tkinter, tomorrow it can be Flask etc. &amp;#x200B; I recommend you to learn Python basics first: [https://www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org) 
Right now it's 75¢ on the dollar. But I converted by Canadian salary to USD because it's more convenient for people reading. I live a comfortable life with the salary that I get paid tbh.
If someone asked me to do a 5 hour paid coding test as part of an interview, for a $54000 USD ($75000 AUD) salary... I wouldn't even respond.
What you quoted literally means "unsafe for concurrent access". Because it is unsafe for concurrent access you need to make sure no concurrent access is happening, and you achieve this by locking. 
Good article. You mention " When a tuple contains only one element, you need to add a comma after the element ". Perhaps it's worth explaining that it's the commas that make it a tuple, and that the parentheses turn the expression list into an expression, or perhaps in more beginner terms, that it's safest just to put parentheses around your tuple. &amp;#x200B; With unpacking, it might be helpful to explain the (relatively) recent variable length unpacking, such as: &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = 1,2,3,4,5 &gt; &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; head, \*tail = foo &gt; &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; head &gt; &gt;1 &gt; &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; tail &gt; &gt;\[2, 3, 4, 5\] &amp;#x200B;
Hahaha, another offended dimwit. So ban me? What makes you think I care?
I just need the basic python with all the modules and etc...
lru\_cache is awesome. Everyone's favorite is Fibonacci: @lru_cache() def fib(n): if n &lt; 2: return 1 return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1) But did you know that the maxsize of lru\_cache in the example above has to be just 2? In a lot of examples they set it to 50 or something to speed it up, but that's just a waste of memory. My biggest problem with lru\_cache is the name. It lru\_cache stands for 'least recently used cache' even though it caches the most recently used arguments.
What! Do companies really ask simple problems like FizzBuzz ? 
Wow, that's a great website.
 (Just as an alternative) I'd probably use `all()` rather than write loops with a constant check inside. I.e. return the `and` of: all(set(r) == wanted for r in board.rows) all(set(c) == wanted for c in board.columns) all(set(b) == wanted for b in board.blocks) ...where the rows, columns &amp; blocks methods are generator attributes. 
If you work for a company, everything you do during the hours they pay you, they own. So they own your code. 
It has its attractive. It also makes python look more like Smalltalk, which is always a compliment!
Different strokes for different folks. I'm not in a point in my career where I feel like I can get a salary like that. I'm 21 with limited actual work experience in the field (although quite a bit of practical experience; and from what I've seen very competent), I get to be a key member of the company and get quite a lot of technical freedom and a lot of flexibility in when and how I work. It's a stepping stone not a destination 🤷♂️
Your validator would need to say if a partial solution was ok too to use that algorithm, but yes... It would cut the search space massively. 
Sure but during the interview I wasn't employed by the company, it was more of an implied contract. I don't think it's black and white
Well I would fuck that up because I don't even know how to play Sudoku, that seems kinda unfair. How much time did you have? I don't understand how they can base someones ability off this, if you don't know the logic, then what? Imagine going to an interview and they say that they have XYZ in their stack and none of that was in the job description (I can imagine Suduko was not in the job description) and then you get there and they slap a test on you.
Easy with numpy: import numpy as np def check(a): first_row = set(a[0]) if len(first_row) != 9: return False array = np.array(a) squares = array.reshape(3, 3, 3, 3).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3).reshape(9, 9) return (all(set(row) == first_row for row in array) and all(set(col) == first_row for col in array.T) and all(set(sqr) == first_row for sqr in squares)) 
&gt; A dictionary contains a key and value but all you really care about is the key. When all you care about is the key, use the built-in `set` type. That way you don't have to spend comment space explaining to the reader that you're ignoring the value.
Yeah but they paid you for your time. 
pip is the standard way to install python packages, conda is just a data-science python packages distribution tool. 
Do they give you access to lookup APIs while you work it through? 
I would pay the users of my open source project to read the documentation. Nobody does. My boss does the same thing, but at least he looks at the source. The problem with documentation is to be complete, you make it hard to find anything useful. It's an organizational problem.
$54k for a development job is ridiculously underpaid for my location.
I’m working on a messaging platform, built with Twilio, flask, and markup. It’s live , just working on the databases. Check it out [here](osm-messaging-platform.appspot.com) 
Other way around... CAD$54k is USD$40k. But the cost of living (if you're not in Vancouver) is generally much cheaper.
Didn’t know this thanks!
It may be a gray area, or a lawyer may know for sure, but the reality is many companies do sketchy things and it’s definitely a practice I would think happens regularly. The only risk for them is if you could prove they used your code. And most likely it wouldn’t be for something like designing the next big thing but just work they needed done like the original comment mentioned.
Be careful you don't automate yourself out of a job. 
Hear, hear
I wasn't aware of how new it was. I remember that Autodesk Maya switched to PySide2 in mid-2016 and broke my original PySide scripts, so I figured it had been around for a while. But it seems "official" support only started about two months ago. Hopefully that means the docs are still being worked on.
I won’t 😅 we’d still need someone to do takeoffs and put together proposals and handle change orders and PM duties. And besides I don’t think I’m gonna broadcast it to the company when I’m done. Just gonna make my life a bit easier!
If there's no sensible default, yeah. 
For junior- and mid-level positions, I'd say that I've had to answer FizzBuzz for over half of the technical interviews that I've had. It's usually the &lt;5 min warmup that you get put through at the beginning of a code test just to confirm that you didn't just completely outright lie about your ability to code.
Over laid and underpaid 
It actually takes a row (`mat[x]`), sorts it, then compares it to list(range(1, 10)) (or `[1, ..., 9]`), and then does the same thing but with the transposed matrix (`list(zip(*mat))[x]`) Should work. It's going through each row and column and making sure they're all 1 through 9. If they are, should be a solution.
I'm pretty sure it would take you less than a week to write a script to copy the text for the C++ documentation to the PySide2 equivalents (like the first page I mentioned above), starting with zero knowledge of how the website is set up. The basic stuff is not that much work. Thanks for the tip on PyQt5 documentation, though - I'll look into it.
I don't know what it properly does, but it looks very useful.
Do you need to have everyone's computer running the scripts? Have you considered setting up a Jupyter server instead that would let people run the scripts on a shared machine, and not have to re-run the output?
A demo would do better than an explanation. &amp;#x200B; It's basically a python shell that isn't processed live, as you type, but is written in blocks, and the blocks can be individually executed. It gives you the persistence of a text file, the responsiveness and excellent auto-completion of a shell, and a little bit of its own unique flavors.
Awesome! This is really the best way to upskill yourself into a better job. One suggestion if I could, you should ask all the questions first and then give the results at the end in a report type format (if that is appropriate, I'm not even sure exactly what business you're in).
They asked me to go through a string and extract unique DNA sequences. It was really simple, but this was for my first programming job out of college.
Grats! What's next?
Please excuse my ignorance, but what do these new versions provide? Are they purely bug fixes?
You like python, and you like doing data analysis, so you write some python scripts to do a routine analysis task. That works great until you want to iterate or see the output of your script as you go along, and worse, what if someone who doesn't understand the analysis wants to follow along? Notebooks provide and interactive environment that is repeatable and interacts with javascript in such a way that you can visualize the outputs right in the browser.
Maybe even a CSV if it meets to be kept
...and I just got the email that Tensorflow 1.13 came out today and supports Python 3.7. 
glad to see it :) keep up the good work
As corret as you are in the general case (PYthon being strongly tpyed), python functions and methods aren't strongly typed in the sense that the parameter's types aren't part of the method signature. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
That's kick ass. Way to go! 
Great stuff! See if you can add a GUI to it using tkinter maybe?
Jupyter notebooks are a way of embedding ready-to-execute python code with markdown documentation, images, and other such things, all in one file, as well as a program for presenting and running them. They're nice if you want to demonstrate a very short script to another person, particularly in a data science context, because of some built-in plotting niceties and the fact that you can run cells of code individually. They used to be called iPython notebooks, because they depended on iPython; however, they support lots of languages now and iPython is useful in its own right (I use iPython daily but it's been years since I wrote a jupyter notebook). It's obviously no substitute for an IDE to develop in, and is more of a sharing/ presentation tool than anything else. But it's great for that.
My gf works at a wholesale b2b flooring company... shed love this. 
And output the results to file, so OP doesn't have to run the calculator again to get the numbers. And to store the results with the folder for the job.
You've been told by the bot before to asks these kinds of questions in /r/learnpython
Sorry bot! I'll post there!
Grats! But is the user account on your computer literally named "User"?
Personally i would put the 'Enter y or n' with the questions that require it. Eg. "Is there any VCT on this job? (y/n):" just to make it cleaner. Or even make the assumption that is what is required since a lot of yes/no questions on computers tend to just require y/n instead of the full words.
I love videos showing python in action. I really want to see videos of someone starting a script and letting it fly. Maybe something that gradually populates/updates a spreadsheet or document. 
Good plan.
Oh, interesting. Why didn't they shortcircuit that? Strange implementation but good to know.
Spin up a process for each job in parallel you want to run
Asking the real questions
Looks awesome. &amp;#x200B; Next steps, if none of the input you put in after is necessary to know from the output you just saw you should just put everything in a single argument to the command. &amp;#x200B; [calc.py](https://calc.py) \-r y -v 612 -l 25000 --vestibule-tile 225 -9 225 &amp;#x200B; and you use argparse for this: [https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html](https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html) &amp;#x200B; That would make this just a very quick thing to type out, then ideally you craft output to a table then send that to a printer (if that makes sense). The neat thing is you could probably just use what you currently have for how the program will run if no arguments are given. &amp;#x200B;
Welcome, and I prefer KDE (Neon), also Ubuntu based. But it's all a matter of taste!
&gt;Just use the standard distribution of python, create a virtual environment, install the required packages, export to a requirements.txt file and then in the rest of computers you just do pip install -r requirements.txt You can feed requirement.txt (standard file used by pip), but you will likely have a better time using conda-env commands. In short, to export, you crate enviornment.yml file by `conda env export &gt; environment.yml` Then, on client machines, you install all packages with `conda install --file environment.yml` If you want, you can read more about that on [https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=environment#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=environment#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
Perhaps that's his work's computer?
I do construction estimation. This might be better. I will continue to tweak and will research how to do this!
😱 genius! Get it to make my own takeoff sheet for me with the results in it. 
They included the rules for Sudoku. That is another thing that actually makes it a good test. You have to be good at understanding requirements and learning something new. They did tell me ahead of time the problem would have something to do with Sudoku so I looked up the rules before the test. I had an hour to do the actual test. I don't remember how long it took but it was well under the time limit.
I was thinking this. Make it much more user-friendly. Aesthetically pleasing as well. 
It takes my input of square footages for vinyl tiles I work with and converts them into boxes needed and glue needed for installation. It gives me how many boxes I need to order so I can properly price a job. Much quicker than me punching my calculator all day!
This^ it’s my work computer. Lol
Oh wow. Not sure about the crossover between brands though. I’m using sf per box with Armstrong Standard Excelon tile. Different manufacturers might have different sf per box though.
I actually like this idea. Much more efficient. Thank you!
Another user suggested this earlier. I’m definitely not done with this program yet but when I am I will update you guys!
https://repl.it/@darkarchon/ParallelGlamorousWearable works! compares that every row and column is 1 through 9. Doesn't matter the order if both the rows and columns are 1 through 9, so you can use sorted and check equality against list(range(1, 10))
Are you sure? It claims to shortcut out, well depending on how you read it: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#all But then they added tests to insure all() shortcuts: https://bugs.python.org/issue17255 It doesn't just seem implied but they test it to guarenteed it does.
Indeed. Since Python is so popular, there are a lot of libraries for it. So there are plenty of libraries that make it easier for you to create a whole array of documents using Python. You could even get it to print the document automatically once you're done. Or send it to a co-worker. Depending on your work flow. 
Conda can do far more for you than pip can, if you need that. Conda can \- install packages for you \- manage different python environments (like virtualenv) \- manage python versions \- remove the burden of compiling python packages locally, needing compatible compiler and dev packages (wheel does that as well if you don't want conda!) &amp;#x200B; Pip can just install packages for you. &amp;#x200B; In fact, you can use pip inside conda environment so you can mix and match. While you are in conda env, you can easily run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install packages from that repo. &amp;#x200B; Note: conda and pip do not use same package repositories so it is possible that you will have to mix and match. That's totally fine, nothing to worry about.
Haha they def do, because thats the part her warehouse workers usually mess up on. No reason someone couldnt expand your idea for different conditions for different brands. Then even further scraping the invoice ticket to generate a loadout checklist. I bet such a program could save them considerate $$$ and returning customers. Good job, very useful idea. 
&gt; what if I need to update those 30+ computers to add on an additional package? Say I realize later I need xlsxwriter for example to be installed on all those computers. As described in other comments, conda should help you here massively. What access do you have to these machines? Physical/ssh? Can you run scripts on them? 
Nice, you might even be able to add an UI if you like, and a autolink to the website or generate an excel for the order!
See this comment: https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aqrz1a/for_those_of_you_who_got_hired_to_work_with/egk1dxu/
&gt;Just use the standard distribution of python, create a virtual environment, install the required packages, export to a requirements.txt file and then in the rest of computers you just do pip install -r requirements.txt That seems good solution if that's the only app using that python distribution and installing packages in global namespace. As well, it does not help if you need different python versions running on the same system. Otherwise, it's likely a good idea to isolate them in some way, at least with virtualenv. Since we're talking here about data-science script, conda is likely the way to go since it's made for these exact purposes.
There is like 2 rules in Sodoku... you don't even need to call it sodoku.. just say given a 9x9 table check: * each row and column has all the digits 1-9. * splitting 9x9 table into 9 3x3 tables, check that each 3x3 has digits 1-9.
&gt;But did you know that the maxsize of lru\_cache in the example above has to be just 2? In a lot of examples they set it to 50 or something to speed it up, but that's just a waste of memory. how is that different? it looks the same to me
1 months experience ✅ 1 half-written CLI ✅ Senior developer seems like the next logical step, duh 😂. But nah, hopefully just expand and finish this. Maybe mess around and make an interface for it to make it more user-friendly.
[https://github.com/realjohnward/Sparlab](https://github.com/realjohnward/Sparlab)
It looks great! It wouldn't be loads more work to get a tkinter GUI that you can quickly tab through and type all your numbers in to. After that, automate the acquisition of the numbers 😉
&gt; And besides I don’t think I’m gonna broadcast it to the company when I’m done. Just gonna make my life a bit easier! This is key. You did this work for YOUR benefit so that you could accomplish the work you owe to your company more effectively. Keep it to yourself. You will be better off in the end. Private employment is a two way business relationship. You are only good to the company if you are making them more money than you're costing them. They will eject you if you become too costly. Always remember that. 
Are you using a library to write that cli? If so which one? I've just been looking at Click for some of my work tasks 
Yes, would be nice to not have to run the whole program again just to change a typo. 
I think you should read many answers where since people use it for different things. All these views could be valuable to understand why people find it useful. I was quite skeptical when I saw my mates using it, but then I slowly transitioned from typing in python shell to this. Here is why: \- it's easy to write more than one line of the code before running. I do not need an editor on the side, crafting functions and then copying to the shell \- results presentation is richer than console. It supports graphs, images, tables. Effectively anything that can be represented by html, css and js \- if you make a mistake, you can trivially rerun that "cell" (chunk of code, nothing else) once you fix the mistake \- you can install it on some more powerful machine and interact with it in your browser, so works for you if you're not super friendly with terminal stuff \- you can export run results as html page. a run of a notebook is effectively a static thing. notebook consists of code + results of running the code. &amp;#x200B; Jupyter notebook have many disadvantages (code review, code organisation etc), but tbh I'd like every REPL being more similar to Jupyter notebook than to current REPL implementation.
we definitely understand it differently. I read it like "slow but safe, guaranteed by a lock" and you read .. well, something else. Nevermind. Have a good day.
Smart man. Im in construction as well - python absolutely has a place in the industry. 
Automate the boring stuff always
You should add a clean exit. Something like: Enter footage (enter to exit): Pseudo code is: If footage == “” break That won’t be too necessary if you make it with GUI or better yet a web app. One of my first python projects I made into a flask app and me and my coworkers use it every day. 
I'd say that most ML people use conda. The main reason is that conda made it quick and fast to support different python versions to install libraries that need compilation. With conda you won't need any compatible compiler or set of dev packages to get them working. As well, if you screw something up, it's trivial to flip the table and recreated your environment from scratch, which is not always the case with pip, especially if some packages are actually installed through distools. Operating system? If you have a GPU and planning to run some DL on your computer, Windows is probably the best shot you got (yes, I am not kidding). I learned that from Jemery Howard (author of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)). He uses Windows because it has the best drivers support for nvidia GPUs.
What does any of this even mean?
No.. I’ve just been writing it all from scratch and googling any errors I can’t solve myself. Using mostly while loops and if statements. I know it’s not the most efficient methods but I’d rather learn now and clean up the code later. 
&gt;. This is very subjective and I feel like I could be doing more. &amp;#x200B; People use logs for different purposes. I guess you should clarify what job you want to fulfil with these logs. If you never say to yourself "oh damn i don't know what's happening here, i wish i had logged that", you could be just fine with basic logs you have right now. There is not right and wrong here really.
As a newbie to python I’m often overwhelmed by all the ideas of what to make and do. I think I’ll definitely add a GUI to this and streamline the process. I work in flooring and have a guy in paint already inquiring about one similar. So who knows, maybe a program that has multiple trades inside of it would be nice. 
VCT/LVT are types of flooring we work with. I take total SF(square footage) and divide it by square footage per box to figure out how many boxes I need + 10% for “waste”. Then I calculate tile adhesive for installation. All this tells me how much material to order so I can bid the job accurately with profit. 
What trade / field?
That’s awesome! Definitely wanna add a GUI eventually. And I had a clean exit before I added another while loop for vestibule tile. It was “Press Enter to exit” at the end. Lol simple but effective. 
This is a good approach. It's how I learned. Maybe the next iteration of your script could make use of some external libraries 
Yeah I know in programming libraries are huge streamliners. Definitely gotta add that to my skill set soon. Just got tired of the tutorial rut 😂
I do not think python is the tool for this, especially if you're making a one-off search. Facebook's bot detection is on point, and you're gonna have a bad day trying to just use a basic "requests" library for this. I would either use (for repeated use) * PhantomJS (Javascript) * Chrome Extension (Javascript) For a one off: * Use the Javascript console, store the working code in a gist and just use it when you need it. Source: I write bots. Even specifically Facebook bots. And mine survived the great Russian purge.
Not too strange you should be able to cd `which pip` (Probably /usr/bin) mv pip pip2 mv pip3 pip Than you can call pip install [PACKAGE] And it will use the pip3 binary. Also pyenv and pipenv are good solutions. I don’t really like virtualenv, but plenty do. 
GC residential. Estimate/takeoffs all the time. I see an opportunity for revit models to be used to build whole estimates, or at least automate enough to get you 90% of the way there. 
I would skip all the Y/N questions. Have the amounts show up, prefilled to zero. If they leave it 0, that means N.
Yeah, I had full access to the internet, my usual IDE setup, anything I would've wanted
Thanks. It makes more sense now
Nice nice. Im sub / commercial flooring. Just randomly asked myself one day if there was an easier way than punching numbers in a calculator for 30 minutes to come up with the information I needed. Especially when we basically use the same products over and over. 
me too!
ok thanks!
Seen that happen once 😀
pySimpleGUI is an easy GUI module to start with. The lead dev u/MikeTheWatchGuy has some really good documentation. I'm almost finished with my first GUI that also started from a command line program https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI
I agree the qt documentation is a mess if you think in python and not C++. &amp;#x200B; On each of the help pages for classes there is this link [List of all members, including inherited members](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaction-members.html) This has been super valuable for me. Even though all the stuff is in C++ instead of python it's usually pretty straight forward to mentally translate.
Very clever.
Takeoffs and landings!
Hey thank you for the detailed response. For linear problems, I will be sure to use Pyomo with the "cbc" kernel. &amp;#x200B; In regards to non linear programming, at least coming from doing spreadsheet optimization in Excel, whenever the decision variable were multiplied/divided by another decision variable (contingent on the way in which you arrange the cells in Excel), I would use GRG Non Linear kernel. For the amount of data that I was using, that was more than enough. There are some clever ways to convert a non linear problem to a linear problem but that may not always be the case for me to do. Is there a kernel similar to GRG Nonlinear in Pyomo?
Will look into this thanks!
What do you think create a virtual environment means???
You can put the values into csv/excel files as a record of each job or for clean reports or whatever you need. [Atomate the boring stuff with python ](http://www.automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter14/)
they say readability counts in python but no other language tempts us to write unreadable code like it
My apologies, I learned the behaviour in an older version (from posts and articles on gotchas) and wasn't aware of the bugfix. Thanks to you for setting me straight! 
My OP was actually mistaken, the short circuit is now explicit from a patch in 2013. Apologies for the misinformation.
You can use input_var.lower() == 'y' Change the case of the input variable to lowercase allowing you to ignore caps cases entirely
This is sweet! Thanks for the input. I’ll check him out!
When you're done, wrap it in a pretty GUI and sell it to that company and others in the industry for $$$.
Yeah I knew this was possible I just used a ton of iF and if and if statements. Which obviously make the code sloppy. But when I go through after I’m done to make the code cleaner I will Be definitely using this suggestion. Thank you!
Definitely thinking about heading down that path eventually lol 
Or add it onto a Django website, and make a compilation of these projects, and end up building a team-site!
I remember the first time I wrote a program similar to this. I called my dad (a previous software engineer) out of excitement, and he said “what if you enter a 7?”. That was before I learned about elif statements and error prevention, so it was quite heart breaking 
Define "upload things to" please. But I think others have already answered :)
Try this. It's a basic numpy operation. a.sum(axis=0) a.sum(axis=1) 
You're missing a step. Taking all your inputs and shoving them into an easy to read spread sheet 
For the sudoku checker, You just have to check each row and column and mark off 1-9 once and only once for each one, right? That sounds like 2 for loops and a list. Did you also have to access the values from an image using an OCR or something? 
A sudoku solver isn't based on summing numbers.
&gt; (97 sec video) Still a video.
Next step you can use tkinter to make a graphical interface where those y/n can be simple checkboxes, the 25000 can be a text box, and the output can just be displayed on screen.

Yeah exactly, those y/n can be simple checkboxes, the 25000 can be a text box, and the output can just be displayed on screen. that way you also could just double click the .py file instead of having to navigate to it in command prompt. Also it looks like you aren't on Windows 10 (judging by your min/max/close buttons) yet so this should work; to open a command prompt window from any folder open the folder in file explorer, hover over a blank area, and hold down shift while right clicking. There will be an option to "open command line here", which in win10 is "open powershell here". No more typing.
**def.** recursion: see [meaning]()
That is awesome! Feel free to DM me if you ever get stuck. Love to see people work hard and improve their lives. It's a long way but if you keep at it, you could end up making it as a software developer. It's not easy, but definitely doeable.
I'd argue he could a actually improve his value to the company by doing this. My job is literally to automate myself out of the equation. I handle the automation framework for EE systems level regression. I've done cell modems, HPC computing networks, and now fiber optic systems is varying use. I take regression plans, the equipment list available and make it so my end goal is to never have to touch it haha. Though as an engineer when something doesn't work you generally have to manually dig in to find out what's up
Be very careful here. If the company can prove that you worked on the script (in whole or in part) on paid time and/or using company resources and/or using information that you would only be privy to directly due to your employment there (e.g. an in-house estimation algorithm, access to price lists) then they have a very good claim to some or all of the intellectual property on the creation. I'm working on a piece of software currently that I plan to sell to my work, as well as other businesses in the industry if it goes well. I am taking very special care to make sure that not a second of paid time goes into coding, researching or otherwise developing the product, that I only use my own personal machine to develop it and that any information used for logic within the software is based on common sense and nothing specific to our business.
Lol, you've never seen Perl have you?
You could even do: If "y" in ans.lower(): do_stuff() Elif "n" in ans.lower(): do_other_stuff() Else: And=raw_input("you're wrong try again: ") This would handle yes, y, Y, and all the no combos... Though there is room for wrong interpretation obviously but if it's just you it may still be ok.
2 questions: What is the sale price of the bananas? Where do you live that bananas are $5 a piece?!
If the arg list gets too long you could also create a yaml config template where you just edit the values in there and run the script against that to create an output file. I tend to write stuff that has defaults that can be overwritten using args or config files but some of my stuff can have like 15 inputs potentially
Sale price is the $2.50 (mistaken were made) &amp; I was exaggerating 😂😂😂
Ok good. I was gonna send you a care package with bananas 😂
😂😂😂 can you handle the challenge? I thought it would be interesting 
Probably better to build a small Django or Flask powered web page instead. Would be a more marketable skill to acquire but nothing wrong with having fun with tkinter first.
I'm gonna play around with it and see. I think I can do it though.
Yes. I'm sure they do. They sent me the key.
Okay great
I'm going to jump in and say that my intuition is that you could check all vertical sets, horizontal sets and 3x3 sets against a Counter of 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '3', etc. If any of them have multiple numbers then it doesn't work. 
Thanks for the offer! That is my end goal. I’m loving code so far!
I agree with the lowercase comparisons. When i do string comparisons, unless the string is case sensitive, i always convert the input string to lowercase to make the comparison. I find it makes it cleaner, simpler, and more robust.
&gt; I'm pretty sure it would take you less than a week to write a script to copy the text for the C++ documentation to the PySide2 equivalents (like the first page I mentioned above), starting with zero knowledge of how the website is set up I'm pretty sure it would take me a lot longer. I struggle with HTML. I don't want to spend a week updating documentation each time I do a release. That sounds like a pain in the ass. I want it to autogenerate and I can live with what it comes out as.
What if I want to comment the selected code instead of placing them in If block.
If they have great Documentation, with a Git repo of example code and a testing API then I'm a pig in heaven. LOL. I'm still working on getting the information, but I have to move quick and figure out if I can get the report I've been asked to generate. I'm reaching out to the Reddit community to get some tips. So on the other assumptions, really? MobileBytes is a POS System. There must be authentication or anyone could look at your sales reports. I have a Key, but I'm not sure if that's all I need. The API has to return something, and it's not going to be an instance of an object class with methods. Its going to return some kind of string, no? Finally, I need to do something with that string. If it's JSON, then I need to parse it into a Python object if I'm going to then sort and filter the data. I've only worked with JSON in a few book exercises. I don't recall it being that easy to work with directly.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Even better: ```python input_var.casefold() in ['y', 'yes'] ``` Handles both “y” and “yes” (also, casefold is the proper way to ignore case in python)
This advice is very much dependant on where one works and under what sort of arrangement. Seek legal advice is the most specific recommendation that applies to everyone.
Ctrl+Shift+/ no wait, let me record an interpretive dance about it
LOL. That's what I said when I got the job. You make a few ABS-scripts, and next you're given a week to get a report that even the makers of the software don't provide. In my experience when you ask them for help, they say they don't provide support for their API. Good Luck. haha.
🤣🤣🤣
Looks too easy. Easy enough to be a homework question.
Honestly I could’ve made this in shortcuts lol. Good luck 
You could initially write a name for the job and have that open a .txt file and from there write to the text file all of your important information and at the end you can have a nice readout of all of your information saved and ready for you whenever you need it! incredibly useful!
People are generally averse to homework posts because you're supposed to solve it yourself. Programming challenges can be found in /r/DailyProgrammer. /r/python is generally for Python news and /r/LearnPython is where you can go to get some help if needed.
Very nice. Love seeing programs that are relevant to the field I work in. I'm a drafter at an architectural firm right now and working on a python calculator for feet and inches but this would have been handy when I was in college working for a project manager doing takeoffs. 
Hell yes dude!
3.7 is backwards compatible with things that require 3.6
&gt;The API has to return something, and it's not going to be an instance of an object class with methods. Its going to return some kind of string, no? Depends on the API endpoint, could be XML, could be an endpoint that simply returns true/false or null. Its all speculation till you read the docs.
Are you likely to benefit by using this on site? You could write a mobile application or a web front end to access remotely and save data for later use.
This is cool OP, got me kinda inspired! 
Numpy isn't going to magically make it 500x faster. There's no vectorized operations you're just looking for x in array, and the arrays are so small that even initialising a 1x9 array is slower than doing standard in list checks. 
As long as you can make sure your apps do not share the same global namespaces of packages, you're good :). Conda or not, probably not that important, especially as the time goes on.
&gt; What do you think create a virtual environment means??? &gt; &gt; Was that a question you want an answer on?
If you have integer variables, bonmin. Otherwise ipopt. Both of them and the GRG solver in Excel find locally optimal solutions. Global (for non-convex) is much harder.
- parse xml, correct the formatting on any fields that needed it (addresses, phone numbers, etc) and put into CSV - design an integration test suite for a couple services. - secret Santa - one place said choose a few medium problems from Euler to submit
As everyone said, it's pretty new (like 6 months or something like that), also it's free (I mean, I don't think anyone is getting paid for doing it, or not too much). &gt; I'm talking about really basic stuff, like the page on signals and slots About signals and slots for Qt for Python, check this wiki page, it's quite nice, but is about the only thing I found of the new implementation. https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Signals_and_Slots All in all, I agree that documentation is poor. I started using Pyside2 recently and it's not been as straight forward as I thought it was going to be.
&gt; There are some guides and articles in the documentation that include python examples too - including one that uses signals and slots, if I'm not mistaken. [Yes, and it's quite nice imo](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Signals_and_Slots). I hope they make the official documentation just like that wiki page. 
It's POS Sales reports so that's at least transactions (date, payment methods, purchase categories, and sales tax and some transaction meta-data). Given that the report everybody wants is not offered, if they have any summary reports available through the API, they're not likely to be of any use. Ok. So...I got the API key. Provided the "end point" exposes the transactions (which the docs should explain), then I'm going to get back records in JSON or XML format (which the docs will explain). Then the lion share of the work will be filtering and sorting these wire formats. 
Wouldn’t it be fewer steps and more user friendly just to have the fields for number entries, and then check the value of the field? Blank field = not used on the project. Non-zero value = used on the project and here is the value. 
I agree. I worked at a place that didn’t do code tests and the quality of engineers there was pretty low. I left in 6 months. I’ve never been asked to do anything that would take more than an hour or two which is reasonable IMO given how much of an investment each side is about to make. Maybe for senior devs if they have a really good github portfolio a test wouldn’t be necessary but for entry level and even mid I think it’s fair. Plus interviewing is hard already and developers are the absolute worst interviewers in any profession I’ve been around. Like pitifully bad, any thing to help supplement the decision being made is a plus to me. Having been in the field almost 10 years I know how arrogant developers are, but very few possess any valuable soft skills like leadership, management or interviewing. Most seem to think because they memorized a few obscure algorithms and are good at video games they must be God’s at everything. (Last bit not really relevant but it felt good typing it)
So part off it is simple problems in a template, but we might look through your answers and poke holes in your code or change the problem and see how you change the answer
Check out the Csv module for importing and exporting data. Easy to use with Excel too
Haha sorry I couldn’t have done it sooner XD
I’m an office guy haha
Thank you! Means a ton. Literally the first actual thing I’ve started building!
I already have a degree but not in Computer Science. I don't want to add more debt. I read that project will increase my value. Should I just build anything using Python? Like web scrapping?
My manager recently told me to do something similar with some of the automation scripts I’ve written for our IT Security Department. I didn’t know this was so common among companies. 
What you could do however is make sure that them sum of every set of every row,column and square is equal to 45 each or in python code, something like this: `sum(set(row))==45`
Everything is a service. Services can be charged for. Gotta maximize those revenue streams.

Libraries that list as compatible with 3.6 are likely compatible with 3.7, however if they haven't had their documentation updated since 3.7 came out, it simply won't list it. The language had a lot of changes from 2 -&gt; 3, and so libraries written for 2.7 need work to be updated to 3.x.
Well done. I just started using curses. It's pretty straightforward. Great initial step if you want an enhanced interface but remain in console. 
Your comment reminded me of the episode of Rick and Morty where Rick collapse the Government by changing a one to a zero. The cut scenes following show the Government officials and president talking about their valueless government. They declare Marshal Law. At some point some one says wait, who is paying me to yell at this guy. Then someone responds, I can answer that.... for $$$. Lol Thanks for making my simple night a little bit better. A true gent. 
It's kinda like saying that python variables are not strongly typed because type is not a part of variable's "signature". Well no shit. Parameters, just like ordinary variables, are "slots" for values and in python it's the values that carry the type. Values have fixed types -&gt; strong "slots" for values don't have fixed types -&gt; dynamic 
Get [this book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G8YAUX4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_Jg4zCb3KNERFA)
That's almost exactly what I did - I started learning Python in High School for fun, got into web dev, and then just gradually built up my skills until I had something decent to show for all of it. Then I went out and got a job with it.

$conda install pandas numpy etc

Glad to see a other brother CM doing the python coding 👍
Can also create a batch file with something like: `start "" "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"` Or %COMSPEC% /k And double-click that to launch a command prompt. I usually use something like that for activating virtual environments and running various scripts. 
Keep it up it is impressive 
Did they let you know that's what you would have to do in your interview or did you have prior experience with said platforms?
Wow I'm kind of doing this for a project at work. I started doing it on accident, I needed tooling around git/deployments/testing/APIs all in one from Windows. Then realized no one else would use the thing from windows cmd so instead `import cmd` and made a command loop. Then realized I could call busybox which came with the minimal git, and that has a decent set of essential unix commands. Got that to work with pipes too! Then `eval` and `exec` and I don't know what's going on anymore oh my. Easy to add ripgrep, neovim, jq. Got any wisdom? Glad someone else is having fun like this!
Well done, I recently automated with python a process to merge and create a new formated Excel file. I used an Excel macro to do that but it was too slow and memory consuming so I decided to try my luck with pandas, I reduced the time from 10 minutes and unusable laptop to 2 minutes and happy laptop
Yeah, I knew that the project was an expectation going into my first interview with them. It was a takehome project so they didn't physically watch me program it. i had some experience with the tech stack prior to doing the interview, but I had no experience with Twilio, no experience with the serverless framework that they wanted me to use, little experience with AWS lambda. If I was asked to do the same project today I could probably do it in two hours with much better results. 
Very cool. Now go further with your idea and use a framework to build a GUI for the application. 
I would argue you’ve violated goal #1. This is not “close to production”, because no one is going to turn off fsync on a production server unless they enjoy losing data. And if you’re not doing fsync, you might miss weird race conditions or bottlenecks that only happen when the database is busy writing to disk. If you’re just running unit tests for code correctness, maybe this is okay 99% of the time. But that other 1% is going to bite your ass in production. 
These are the kind of problems Pythons so great at. Good work! All good coders start with practical simple stuff , and its the solving of them that opens the gateways to the tougher ones. Your on the right path
Theres a few modules that can specifically work with excel docs (important if your software needs to work for non technically inclined folks), but CVS is super easy to work with
Thank you too u/MikeTheWatchGui for your wonderful project! PySimpleGui is making the user interface development easy. Having one sole api interface compatible with different frameworks is great. You are working hard for the open source community, I can't imagine how much ours you spend for PySimpleGui library and its extensive documentation. And so thank you!
&gt;I'm pretty sure it would take you less than a week to write a script to copy the text for the C++ documentation to the PySide2 equivalents (like the first page I mentioned above) then why don't you go ahead and do it? IIRC the PyQt5 docs are just links to the Qt C++ docs so I wouldn't get your hopes up there. I get that its hard at first to translate from C++ into python but you get used to it quickly. You have to realize that PyQt and Qt for Python (Pyside2) are just python bindings for the Qt application framework, whose C++ docs are incredibly robust. The basic data types translate almost directly, so you can read the docs for the C++ fucntions and know with almost certainity the python version's call signature. There's definitely some gotchas but they're pretty sparse. One that comes to mind is figuring out how to declare the type on Signals for some of the python objects - like a signal accepting an object type dict maps to QVariantMap object in C++ which can only have strings as keys, thus causing problems. However you can just declare a signal to accept a generic python object as its type to get around that. So yes the docs aren't perfect, but the Qt C++ docs are some of the best I've interacted with for frameworks of that size. 
Who's getting the measurements?
This is something i want to do. It is very interesting the GUI approach I will pay more attention to it while finishing my course. So turning it into an GUI app will it hide the code?
Think they were talking about a sudoku validator, at least initially.
Just QWidget() works too. 
Look at Python examples. They should be enough to learn how Python side API works and after that C++ docs work for E.g. widget particulars. 
I was thinking of getting a Raspberry Pi 3 and putting Ubuntu on it (I know how to do what I want to do on Ubuntu). That I think would be my ideal scenario, just want to make sure that will work before I waste money on finding out it won't! &amp;#x200B;
I run and code on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ ($35 computer) on my TV. You can even code on your smartphone.
I feel that this could have easily been solved with a couple of excel formulas. I am all for using python, but in this case it seems like it's completely unnecessary to me. 
OK thanks Grizzled! Sounds good, I might well do that. I'm coding fine on my laptop it's just that I want some of my stuff to be running constantly (chatbots etc). &amp;#x200B;
You have to use either `0 - var` or `var * -1`. BTW, Python is an interpreted language. You can verify this problem yourself by running the interpreter and trying to use `-var`. 
Depends on the type of the variable. Are we talking integers/floats here? Some vector type? Some weird class that prints "POTATO" when you call `__neg__`? Nah I'm messing with you. Although the behavior _could_ be different depending on type, based on context I can tell you that they will be the same. However, this would take all of like 5 seconds for you to test on your own. Also, if you must ask, please ask in /r/learnpython in the future. 
Constant running may change things. If it's prone to overheating (Pi will be fine) you may want to monitor the temp. Lol, make a Twitter bot that tweets the internal temps every 15 minutes.
You definitely can, but for running as a server headless Raspbian would be better. You can always reflash the SD card to test some distros out. A Raspberry Pi would not be a waste of money. The power costs are very low compared to a 'proper pc', so it's also a very good choice for running 24/7.
raspbian.

&gt; BTW, Python is an interpreted language. You can verify this problem yourself by running the interpreter and trying to use `-var`. Indeed, you can verify that your answer is wrong in the REPL. s == 2 print(-s) # prints -2
Wait, what? That is stupid :/
Well played buddy. 
Not that kind of python.
Please note the side bar. such a question should be posted in r/learnpython and not here. 
Why? Unary negation is a feature in most modern languages.
Not really no, it's hard to hide python code, even turning it into an exe application will keep the code easy to read. 
Because it is prone to errors. But, maybe my view is too conservative. 
...how? Have you put a minus sign in front of a variable without noticing or something?

Get a Python interpreter for your phone and run it there, so your employer doesn’t have the source code running on their kit. E.g. Pythonista for iOS; it’s not free, but it’s awesome and worth the money. You can even create a nice UI for entering the data, and it will look like a pro app. I have it installed in my iPad, and occasionally write code on the move (planes, public transport, etc)
Yes. Also when modifying the code or pasting.

Better option to import a config file than bang out one question at a time I think.

you give an authoritative response that is wrong and tell OP how to verify it without having verified it yourself
As an (ex) mutual funds dpt. employee I can state with the out most certainty that you get a numbers inverted sign by multiplying said number with -1.
Sorry, for me it was obvious that you cannot negate variables directly. I was wrong. 
At my workplace, we have a dozen GUIs written in PyQt running to keep things afloat. For the last 3days we've been looking for a way to run them all from the webbrowser. This is excellent and timely, thank you!
Where the fuck do you people work that innovation is punished? Every time there is an “I automated some shit” post, the most upvoted comment is something like this.
I mean … it’s just math. 2 - 1 = 2 + (-1)
Could use numpy https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.randint.html
* numpy library has this option * you can use list comprehension instead of for loop * go to r/learnpython in the future
I know this could be easily replaced with a spreadsheet, but it feels so good to make something on your own that is actually useful. Good job! How that you're familiar with python, take a look at SikuliX. It can be used to automate things based on images you create into the code itself. It is one of the most satisfying things to code in as a newbie since you can SEE it do things. I try to use it anytime I get the chance!
Oh Yes! I forgot "waiting for network"! &amp;#x200B; It has been a major issue in many many projects of mine. Requests served in 8/9 seconds, days spent optimizing a 3 query endpoint, only to find out that between my code and the user I had to pass though a million layers of proxies dispatchers, vpns and such. The a sysadmin changed a switch and we finally had the sacred performance boost.
Who downvoted this guys post there was no reason to
Don't you have to use some decimal precision library for finance? Check how they say to negate. Maybe rounding works differently for negatives?
Use python eel gui to beautify it 
Surprised it had room to breath with the jvm in there
Tbf automating mundane tasks give you more free time to better and cooler things I've automated so much of my job doing python Ive learnt html and css whilst at work. Next goal is mastering databases and a Web framework! @op well done mate, keep it up! 
https://docs.python.org/2/howto/sockets.html r/learnpython
Thanks grzeki, actually that is one of the pages I read, however it makes no mention of json. I can make a socket client/server ok, but it's the json which is throwing me off I think. I'll try asking in the other sub. Cheers.
Project based learning is great, if it works for you.
thanks, i have made noticeable progress but i just wanted to ask if it was a good technique as i got more advanced. i’m currently learning tKinter 😃
Nice work my dude. And also, to keep you motivated, I still get this excited when I make a cool new program and I've been doing it for many years. And it's my day job too.
Socket does not care about format of your data. It’s just bytes like any other bytes. You have to set up everything around to make it through. See the message termination discussion in this tutorial - basically you need to add a custom header to the JSON or detect the end of JSON (risky).
A Content Management System for a mobile app. I spent the last 4 months rolling my own until I discovered Wagtail... and I'm in love. I have to throw out 80% of the work I've done, but holy shit I'm in love with Wagtail. It's absolutely amazing. I was building the CMS UI in React myself, which was a terrible experience, and now I'm just extending the Wagtail admin site with almost no hassle. God the Python ecosystem is amazing. 
Then why don’t you do it?
1: /r/learnpython 2: read the sidebar Pick a repetitive automatable task and do it in python.
it is actually 0 + a - 2 \* a
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
oh i’m sorry
its extremely exhilarating when you solve a problem with code, you feel this sort of rush of power like you control the laws of physics just dont get disheartened when you come to bigger projects and run into road blocks. at first coding isn't too awkward but it grows in complexity and my mistake when i was younger was to get frustrated and give up. if you keep butting your head against that wall you eventually figure it out, learn something, and feel even more awesome
Thanks for your reply! I'll go to this sub in the future:)

3: report your own post because of what you learned from 2
I remember many years ago a fellow programmer who used (strictly from memory as it's CORAL66) `x := x - x - x` :-)
&gt;my current method of learning is learning &gt;is that a good way to learn #ಠ_ಠ
`pycrypto`? (not built in)
No man this was Definitely built in ... I feel like I'm losing my mind right now. I looked at it a few times ... It's completely non existent
If the libraries are pure Python they are almost certainly going to be compatible between 3.6 and 3.7. If they have to be compiled from C, FORTRAN or whatever who knows? Off of the top of my head I certainly don't, and I'm rather embarrassed to admit that I've been using Python for nearly 20 years. :-(
Good job but honestly is this not something that could be calculated with an Excel sheet?
I wrote a podcast downloader and a slackbot to learn by doing 
Me. I do takeoffs on architectural drawings. Lol
Yessir. Trying to move up here then eventually work in programming full time. 
I will check it out!
The point here is to get me to learn python. Not use what’s easy. If I did that I’d never learn python. Lol
Whatttttt. Didn’t even know this was a thing. Thank you!
The only thing that I can think of in this area is `hashlib`.
Thanks! I’ll make sure to check it out!
Definitely looking forward to Django. Back to tutorials. Haha
It is. But I’m using this as an opportunity to learn a programming language that I don’t know. 
If it gets too crazy I have to walk away and come back with a fresh set of eyes. I’ve already done this 1-2x before and it’s helped tremendously. Breaks are huge for me. 
It wasn't `secrets`, was it? https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html
Why doesn't she have a simple excel worksheet to do this? It doesn't (from what I can see here) appear to be anything that warrents a sledgehammer approach when a few cells and formulae would solve the problem without obfuscating for any future users. Maybe I missed something.
&gt;my current method of learning is by trying new things and learning from those new things along the way, rather than just learning from a course. &gt;is that a good way of learning
Congrats. Can you please tell me where and what tutorials did you complete? I started a code academy tutorial, dont really know how good it is though. Thanks and good luck. 
I'm decently experienced with Python development and never cared to find out how to do this. Thanks for teaching me something.
Which is best website to learn Python for finance? I do follow some youtube vid but run in to trouble installing one thing or the other. Would appreciate your advice!! 
No, at that time I was totally new to programming and the only thing interesting enough for me to understand, among a few other things, was Cryptography. Bizarre
I really don't understand why people view list/dict/set comprehensions as hard to read. Sure you can write bad ones, but single_digits = all(x =&lt; 9 for x in some_struct) ...is more readable to me than... single_digits = True for x in some_struct: if x &gt; 9: single_digits = False break
Install anaconda. It has most of the useful packages(including cryptography) installed by default.
https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/
Oh, I recommend learning Vim at some point, but that point is when you're not learning Python, wait till you've programmed for a few years. Vim is possibly one of the most powerful text editors there is, but it will take you about two weeks from you start using it till you're able to write code nearly as fast as you did with any other text editor. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

If you're going to make a gui, I strongly advice making a web based one using eg flask. It will teach you so much about web development and be more deployable than a tkinter gui. 
I'm sorry what do you mean by 'pip freeze'? I just remember downloading python, being completely new to programming, I used the "help()" interface and one of the only things that I recognized was 'Cryptography' and I specifically read about it and thought It was interesting and I'd come back to learn it some day ...
Can you post the GUI version as well if you do make one?
Ubuntu is overkill; pick a lightweight distro like raspbian, and SSH into it. No point wasting precious CPU cycles on a fat GUI when all you need is a server.
There is also `from distutils.util import strtobool`

It would be cool to run this on pro boxing data, to test the hypothesis that boxing is all a bunch of one-sided tuneup fights.
This is neat work, it will be interesting to see whether the model will translate to be an effective predictor for new (I.e. not in the training dataset) fights 
Will definitely keep you guys updated. Probably gonna take me a bit though. Work and family life lol 
A small suggestion, store the answers in a json file and add a parameter to run from Json file, that way there is a record of what is entered, and if something changes or a typo is made, it can be easily fixed without having to re-enter everything.
I went through freecodecamp.org on YouTube. They have a 4 hour python video. Watched that, then spent about a week following tutorials for random programs I didn’t wanna make. Then decided that I needed to try something useful so I’d have a vested interest in actually completing a project from start to finish. All this code is from scratch with no libraries. Every time I run into something I can’t solve I google it and see what others do. I then implement that into my code and keep going. I also purchased a python book from amazon. “Python Crash Course” by Eric Mathes. Though I’m only about 100 pages in.
I appreciate you considering me for this. Unfortunately I have about 1 month experience in python. I have no clue lol
Definitely gonna be looking into that this weekend. Thank you!
Wow I didn't know that that's actually useful
cool idea !

I've bumped into this problem before very quickly with the statmodels/numpy/pandas/scipy stack 1. Inspect venv with ncdu and start from the top (pandas has a big test/ dir for example) 2. OpenBLAS is a big piece of the bulk, if you can match scipy and numpy versions so that they use the same vendored blas and share it (I think pyinstaller does this) 3. Look at compiling all `.pyc` ahead of time and delete `.py` files
Thanks for the feedback man. The accuracy is based on out of sample which is fights not in the training dataset, was done using a split of 85% train and 15% test. More info in the jupyter notebook below ! [https://github.com/jasonchanhku/UFC-MMA-Predictor/blob/master/UFC%20MMA%20Predictor%20Workflow.ipynb](https://github.com/jasonchanhku/UFC-MMA-Predictor/blob/master/UFC%20MMA%20Predictor%20Workflow.ipynb)
Sponsor banner in their github README.md! Haven't seen that before but imagine I will see a bunch now. Who will sponsor my readme sponsor banner block repo? &amp;#x200B;
Added brief discussion of pathlib to the article. It does have great high-level functionality. Would be nice if it contained the lower level functionality, too. &amp;#x200B; Thanks again!
Pre-tax? that's quite bad for if you live in a tech hub and considering AWS and Twilio are fairly new technologies you had to know right off the bat, pretty sure i get paid more for sys admin work. Really would not like to live in Canada.
Did you use a particular site for your tutorials?
How? it's a choice, and most people with experience will tell you to piss off anyway so it's self-defeating.
Let me know which widgets and capabilities you need. I'll do my best to have them available for your use. Don't want to see it not work out for you just because one feature is not yet done.
Yeah, mine started as a prototype too. I still haven't properly refactored everything. The hardest thing to deal with for me has been paths. pathlib is very nice, but it's not everything. 
Nice stuff. Out of interest do you know how accurate the decimal odds predictor is on its own?
How long did it take y’all to build it?
Perfect thanks so much!
where are you pulling the statistics to run the regression? 
We started out without barely any knowledge of python. We worked on it for a few weeks including learning python. Building the robot and testing it was done in a few days :)

Nice, hadn’t heard of that one. Important to note that it will raise an error if it gets unexpected input though (just checked the docs).
This looks interesting. How did you do it? What library did you use? My bro has a robot car that looks similar to this. But I have no idea how to go about programming robot cars. 
Well there are dozens or brands. Dimensions, supporting material that have dependencies etc. but the point would be the step by step guided approach down the decision tree that auto calculates. The target audience would be low skill entry level warehouse workers. The answer is sure you can use a giant excel sheet for a lot of the same things you use a script for. But in the same regard you can put a lot of stuff in spreadsheets that we dont for good reason. 
I didn't build it. But in case it was buidl with pattern recognition, i would use OpenCV. Then only realize the black and white with a direction.
Are you guys bachelor students?
65%. Which means if you pick favourite only based on decimal odds, 65% of the time you'll get the right pick. I am thinking of enriching the dataset by adding fight camp as some fight camps are known to have high winning rates.

We used the GPIO library. Here's a tutorial we used to to get the motor up and running: [http://explainingcomputers.com/rasp\_pi\_robotics.html](http://explainingcomputers.com/rasp_pi_robotics.html) We used a infrared sensor to detect a white or black color. Here's an tutorial on that: [https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi-ir-sensor-tutorial](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi-ir-sensor-tutorial)
It's part of the web app script. However, scraping scripts are separate. The web app scripts pulls the scraped data from an API and then runs the classification.
Very cool
Pure Python can still have issues when upgrading, but its much more rare. An example of the Py36 to Py37 transition being an issue are custom defined iterables that used `raise StopIteration` to signify that the item has been exhausted. In Py37 the exception is no longer silently captured, and can cause code that relied on the prior behaviour to now fail.
You may want to also scrape flight times if available. Fighters travelling farther will be more tired, fighters travelling too soon before a fight will be more tired.
Better than Uber's self-driving car
Interesting theory there buddy. I would also be curious to know the winning % of fighters fighting at home soil vs travelling abroad. Definitely worth a look !
Exactly.
Did y’all use opencv or some other package to manage the video input?
This is the reason that programmers spend time writing release notes. Fail to read them at your peril.
We tried working with opencv but it didn't give us the results we wanted. We taped a color sensor at the bottom to read white or black colors. For this we used: [http://bradsrpi.blogspot.com/2013/05/tcs34725-rgb-color-sensor-raspberry-pi.html](http://bradsrpi.blogspot.com/2013/05/tcs34725-rgb-color-sensor-raspberry-pi.html) For the engine we used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTBBcCV7A28 [http://explainingcomputers.com/rasp\_pi\_robotics.html](http://explainingcomputers.com/rasp_pi_robotics.html)
You have to write that interface in C and this is most definitely the wrong place to ask for help with that. Python doesn't do bare metal.
Sorry to say but there has definitely never been a built in general purpose cryptography-specific module, and the **cryptography** module itself has never been bundled with standard Python installations; it's been a 3rd party install from day one. Until relatively recently US export restrictions would have made it illegal to do so for a distribution downloadable directly from a website; even now bundling cryptographic primitives of any significant strength would potentially restrict Python from being distributed to countries like Iran. Outside the issues with the US many countries have adopted import restrictions that bring up similar issues, albeit to a lesser degree. This is why you'll rarely find strong cryptographic primitives bungled in an open source language distribution; it's simply not worth the trouble to attach those problems to the core language tools. It's likely you were either working with a non-standard distribution -- I've no idea what Anaconda, for instance, ships with -- or perhaps a system Python installation that had had some extra site packages installed by the vendor. Either that or you accidentally installed it yourself. One way or another it's never been part of the standard library. There _are_ crypto-adjacent modules in the standard lib -- see [hashlib, hmac, secrets, and on Unix crypt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypto.html), but these do not allow you to do keyed encryption / decryption, they only allow signing and one-way hashing.
Raspberry Pi?
Yes
You've got two options: use the Python C API to write a module to inerface with the CUDA APIs, or use the ctypes module to directly interface with the same APIs. The former is more difficult, but may be faster. The latter is easier, but has overhead. There's also a couple of 3rd party options, cffi, that might help make things easier, and cython, that might make it easier to write faster interfaces. You've got options.
[removed]
Hell yes. I've worked with a codebase that was an utter mess of spaghetti code, and as such required extensive debugging and refactoring (wound up getting a go-ahead on just rewriting it from scratch - it originally ran on pure *CGI* for the UI). Aside from the readability concerns - which are a massive pro - passing the arguments by parameter name lets you sidestep positional changes in call sigs. F(a,b,c) is now F(c,a,b=3,q=1,h=2)? No problem, if the new kwargs' defaults don't alter the logic, you won't even notice the difference. Same thing if G(a,b,c) got refactoring to G(b, **kwargs) and vice versa.
Hasn’t this been available for a while? I’ve been using it for months. 
You're probably never gonna catch fsync related weird race conditions with your testing framework. Testing for bottlenecks is also not something I've ever used (or ever heard of anyone using) the test framework for.
More work has been done on this just yesterday 15/02/2019, please see [https://bugs.python.org/issue32947#msg335623](https://bugs.python.org/issue32947#msg335623)
Yes we put a Raspberry Pi on top.
I have to do this at the end of my current python class. How hard was it?
Not a very helpful tutorial on a site that is overburden with JS and a "Live" chat that pops up.
very cool, well done!
Very cool! If you want it to go faster, look into the PID control algorithm, it's rather easy to implement and leads to great improvement.
It was pretty easy to do. There's already alot of tutorials out there so by following them you should be able to do it.
I
I'm writing my first legitimate program in vi, which I'm new to as well. Through fire and the flames
Not sure if they did this for a class or not, but my school has this as a class project for a 100 level ECE course.
Seems like you should test it on someone you think is competent to see if it’s clear for what you’re trying to test. It feels like I’m trying to help you cheat.
That's true if you're only iterating over Fibonacci numbers in order. If you access the sequence at random places you'll get lots of cache misses if you set maxsize to 2.
What's the reason for having two ultrasonic sensors? They don't look like they are inclined.
If you literally mean "no libraries" then you're going to need to learn C or C++ and the CUDA SDK. You'll need to learn how to write C libraries for Python or figure out how to use Boost to let your Python code call your C++ libraries. You'd also need to learn a few things to regarding parallel and vector programming and really low level C stuff like a keeping track of allocated memory because nothing does it for you. Start with looking into the CUDA SDK. If you meant “no libraries” as in something like numpy-with-cuda then you could check out PyCUDA package which would do all the stuff in my first paragraph for you.
Good Lord this is amazing. I really hope you folks consider releasing this under a more permissive license. In my org, we ended up packaging Python 3.6 in a non-standard directory, but that's a massive pain in the rear. We can't use it with an AGPL license though.
In which country the slow lane is just in the middle?

What kind of OS is running on the raspberry PI?

what kind of feedback are you looking for?
Aren’t the beginning python courses at [datacamp ](www.datacamp.com) free? 
Cool! Thanks for sharing. 
Sololearn thats my favourite course place and its free
Linux
Is is controlled by an always-running programm?
Can you show us your code?
I just checked it out and it seems like you have to provid a phone number and school but I don't really feel to comfortable with sharing that... Is there another alternative?
I've tried Sololearn out before and it works fine but I don't like that they don't allow you to write the whole code, just the things they chose to cut out, for example: \_\_\_\_\_('Hello'). Do you know any other site that's similar?
Basically wrap anything you want in bytes, send it, and have the server parse out what you need and process it.
I’m very pro python for automating tasks but have u tried google sheets? I find it amazing for on the go spreadsheets. (Also has great API if you want to do some data analysis in python at the end of the year)
If the reps already carry a laptop with Excel to the customer, are they actually unhappy with this? You might find they don't actually need a new solution. Rewriting your formulas in python shouldn't be difficult for you, but coding either a webpage or iOS app, and potentially connecting it to a database over the internet, is quite a bit of extra work if you don't already know how to do it. As @prod_engineer said, you might consider Google sheets. You can write scripts for that which could for example email you when a rep completes a quotation. 
If your python isn't self-commenting enough, the notebook format helps with that as well.
Have you tried https://www.learnpython.org ?
Besides the raspberry pi what hardware did you need 
I had a similar assignment in 2013, but I also had to stack a brick on a pillar and hit a ball into a cup that was 1 foot away. **These damn millennials have everything so EASY!** /s
&gt; Numpy doesn't run code on an available GPU by default. If you're trying to get comparable performance, you should be looking elsewhere first. PyCuda and Numba require numpy to accelerate the code, I am not using numpy And You are right about my meaning of bare metal programming 
Take a look at exemplary Jupyter notebook, for example here https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicolasfauchereau/Python_NIWA_Wellington/blob/master/notebooks/IPython_notebook.html This should help you see the difference comparing to IDE. I'm using it when I want to run 'chunks' of code (in notebook 'cells'), exploring possbile solutions doing data exploration. Also, to present/share/explain solutions step by step.
You'll want to ask this on /r/learnpython. You can do it in python exactly like you would on the calculator; for example, 1+1 in the calculator is same in python, or ((5*7)+8)*9
From the excellent detail if eager that you've got a syntax error
Thanks. Just posted this same question over there 
How did you make it nice and presentable? Like colored and not in the shell like everything I write? Haha
The advantage of the Ipad is that he can make notes as more importantly can draw the specifications in a note app. Therefore, I want to load the "check-list price calculator" onto the Ipad so that he can give the customer an estimate in the second and not afterwards, giving him the opportunity to discuss the price straight away in case anything is unclear. &amp;#x200B; I have heard of Google Sheets, but haven't tried it out! Seems very interesting! 
Doesn't work to well
No I haven't, I'll check it out now. thanks!
There is a program [Pycel](https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel) which does just that. It translates a Excel spreadsheet into executable Python code which can be run independent of Excel. It does not support VBA though. Good luck! 
 #!/usr/bin/env python3 import socket import json s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.bind(('localhost', 42422)) s.connect(('localhost', 42422)) payload = json.dumps({'foo': 'bar'}) payload_len = len(payload) s.send(str.encode(payload)) recv_payload = s.recv(payload_len) print(json.loads(recv_payload)) s.close() ---- [~/script/python/dev/socket_example](-): python sock_test.py {'foo': 'bar'} This isn't the exact code you would want to use to manage sockets, but it gives you an idea that you have to create a socket object, bind a socket to an address and port, setup a connection, send bytes to it and receive bytes back of `len`. Basically you can send anything you want to a socket as long as it's bytes. It is up to you to do the type casting on the output. Since you know it's going to be json, that's fairly straight forward.
Thank you very much for the reply!

Mate, you are a life saviour! &amp;#x200B; I just tried it out and it works flaweless. Just had to drop it into my G. Drive account and open it with Google Sheets and it works on Ipad. Very very awesome, thanks! 
Sweet I’m glad. I toyed with doing the same thing for my last job when we were doing motor installations, it would be super fun but a lot of maintenance every time we came across a new motor load curve. Check out coda.io and smartsheets too if you are into fancy excel.
Good point here. Macros in google sheets are pretty handy and good examples online for them. Or else you can record them and use that
how about a $50 Dell laptop on Ebay? Put Linux Mint 18.3 on it. Then you don't need a TV, monitor, mouse; you just need the laptop. The original all in one computer.
Yeah!! That's what I like about coding, you just need to have the brains to get the cash
and the most ancient of languages: math
have you never done math before?
Why do you need a substitute?
is it possible to use in\_fp.eof()? will it work?
I've only ever done an intro to python course but I have no idea how you use python to program hardware...how does it work?? Explain like Im 5? 
We used a powerbank for the batteries, a rgb color sensor and the robot is a standard robot package you can buy. We also had an ultrasonic sensor but we didnt use it. 
Yes we had to manually turn it off

i abuse the shit out of them like everyone else, they are great for getting things done, they just dont look nice
Really cool to look at! Did you use a PID to drive along the border between black and white or is it a digital black/white recognition? A few years ago I and a few frieds of mine programmed a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot with Python using an SD card to liveboot a Linux System on it and it was so much more convenient to program using Python instead of the Mindstorms Programming Software... I could just use a PID library instead of tediously transferring it into the graphical interface of the software
Works better than one that doesn't exist at all!

You are very close, but that won’t actually loop. Also, you are looking for y and n in the input value, which seems a bit backwards, and might occasionally produce unexpected results. You’ve also used raw_input, which is now just input in Python 3, and casefold is the proper way to ignore case in Python. Here’s what you are looking for: ```python TRUE_VALS = ('y', 'yes') FALSE_VALS = ('n', 'no') while True: response = input("Put in some input: ”) response = response.casefold() if response in TRUE_VALS: result = True break elif response in FALSE_VALS: result = False break else: print("Invalid input! Please try again.") ``` Or, with a simple recursive function: ```python TRUE_VALS = ('y', 'yes') FALSE_VALS = ('n', 'no') def get_yesno(prompt="Yes or no? ", err_text="Invalid input.") response = input(prompt) response = response.casefold() if response in TRUE_VALS: return True elif response in FALSE_VALS: return False else: print(err_text) return get_yesno(prompt) result = get_yesno() ```
This is lovely. Hope to get there soon
I used colorama(specifically imported Fore) and init(convert=True) to convert the colors to a format that windows can recognize. ie without converting, colorama would only be recognize by linux. coloarama example: from colorama import Fore print(Fore.RED + "Hello") Would print hello in red. And everything printed after hello would also be red unless you reassign a different color ie Print(Fore.RED + "hello") Print(Fore.BLUE + "world") Would print hello in red and world in blue and everything after world would be blue unless reassigned again.
I'd recommend you to read "Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin. In one of the chapters of this book, he takes the example of Conway's game of life to illustrate how powerful coroutines can be. Reading this specific chapter was a game changer for me.
My fundamentalist nature would force me to code it all myself. But good work on ctrlc gtrlv
He programmed a raspberry pi, which has sensors connected to it, that it uses for input to control the movement.

Some high schools have kids that are interested on making Python robots. My school has kids that smoke in class and think they're cool. #feelsbadman
IDK exactly what you are trying to do, but if you change the extension of a Python file from .py to .pyw, it won't open the console when it runs. 
Okay thank you. that is very useful. 
Hi OP One clever way to get -S is noting that it is the solution to the equation x+S=0. I would code up a root finding algorithm to solve for the above equation to find -S.

oh i’m sorry about that, i’ll check out the discord. 
You are welcome :)
Hypothesis enthusiast here! Your usage of the library looks fine to me... but your tests are pretty weak! For example, `test_second_index` would pass if you implemented `second_index` as `lambda *args: None`. I'd try to: - Test that you only get `None` if the count of occurrences of the substring is &lt; 2 - Test that there is exactly one earlier occurrence of the substring if the result is an index And I won't give any spoilers, but a puzzle for you: are those two conditions enough to fully specify the correct behaviour of this function?
This is pretty cool and inspiring! I have a rasperrypi but never did much with it. 
Are you just choosing the peaks? Is the purpose to extract the Gaussians which superimpose to give the observed data?
Yes to both. The peaks give estimates for mean and height of the Gaussians which are used in the scipy curvefitting function. The standard deviation estimates are fixed for the moment but it still works alright 
well i fucking love it
Pretty good for highschoolers. But you definitely can dump down the side of the robot. Maybe it’s not necessary to use a RPI at all. A simple Arduino would just do.
3.7 promoted async and await to keywords, which broke any library using those as variable names. This turned out to be fairly common. 
I love this. Can I see how you did it? 
Can I see your code? I am trying to do something of the sorts for my work.
Code, or it didn't happen. 
Hey y'all, I've been dabbling with Python for a few years and am slowly getting more serious about it, I'm still a novice but am happy with the productivity of the programs that I have made. I've been feeling frustrated with modules, their compatibility, the compatibility of their requirements and modules with identical names. Module hunting is akin to an rpg and when I am 3 layers in trying to problem solving sub modules to work so I can test the module I think I want is when I get frustrated. Actual coding is a 10% of the total time, it seems for me that python is about module hunting. Any tips? I've been making cheat sheets to help me retain info while I go. I know that without these modules I'd have 0% chance of accomplishing my programs so I don't mean to knock them!
Nice one. I'm thinking it would be a great idea to write and understand my own YouTube downloader as all these short-lived extentions, addons are a joke.
