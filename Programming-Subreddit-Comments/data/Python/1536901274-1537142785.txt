Check out r/learnpython for help. You’ll also need to give a bit more information, like what’s the program, are you printing anything?
Looks like the Padding submodule doesn't exist in any released version. The file isn't in [2.6.1](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/tree/v2.6.1/lib/Crypto/Util) nor 2.7a1 so you'll need to either install from git or use a different padding implementation. Given the [implementation there](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/master/lib/Crypto/Util/Padding.py) isn't very complex, it's probably easiest to copy the bits you need into your program.

&gt; no, but taken as part of whole coding culture you're missing all the other cultures that use this terminology to describe setups any advanced system, whether mechanical, electrical, or programmatic, uses these words because they are concise and convey the relationship clearly 
Right, so that's a bit of an overstep there. 
Changing the words does not change that these sub processes are beholden to the master controller, and *are* slaves. Do these people want the word to be stricken from the language? Isn't that even more problematic?

Can you link an example of these articles? Your summary of them makes them sound 100% wrong, at least re: point 1. All programming languages that I know of are very strict under that definition, code is either valid syntax or it isn't, there's no in between. The code ultimately has to be parsed and executed by a computer, so there needs to be a clear definition of what each symbol does. Depending on the syntax, valid code in some languages will end up looking similar to the same idea expressed in words, and Python is pretty good in that respect. But that doesn't mean you can just take the words and expect them to be valid syntax.
I thought future imports were permanent...
Still, how would donating money to the developers help increase adoption rates? 
I did about a year ago. 3.5 is on the chopping block soon.
Happy to help, I've been learning about writing sports simulations for a couple of months so this was a fun question to try to solve. &gt; Could I make the ranges wider to potentially include a small percentage of there being busts? You maybe aren't entirely familiar with normal distributions or standard deviations or maybe just not how they are applied in regards to the random.gauss() function. Just guessing but I think a little bit of knowledge would make the answer easier to understand so sorry if I am explaining anything you already know. Basically, the results from the random.gauss() function creates a specific curve called a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) more commonly referred to as a bell curve outside of statistics. The first parameter (mu) of random.gauss() represents the mean value of the bell curve, which would be the highest point and center of the bell. The second parameter (sigma) is the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) (stdev) of the distribution. This is just basically how packed together your values are. In a normal distribution 68% of your values will be within the first stdev, 95% within the second, and 99.7% within the third. So random.gauss(58, 9) means that if you generated 100 values 58 would be the most common, 65 of the values would be 49 &lt; x &lt; 67, 95 would be 40 &lt; x &lt; 76, and 99.7 would be 31 &lt; x &lt; 85. The closer to the middle of the bell curve the more frequently the number will show up. In the second example I generated twice the amount of picks that I needed and then just threw away the bottom half because it seemed to make more sense to have the bottom of the draft all have really similar ratings rather than having a few really rare terrible players that shouldn't really be in the draft to begin with. As far as busts go, I think the fuzz function probably would be able to do that, it's just not fuzzing hard enough yet. You could use another random.gauss() instead of the random.uniform() I have in their now and make your parameters (mu=0.4, sigma=1) or something, that way the fuzz will normally be pretty moderate but rarely will make the player get picked way earlier/later than they should be. I explain the fuzz function a little more in your question about that. You could also use an if statement that just very rarely creates a chance for the the fuzz function to recursively call itself. def fuzz(val): fuzz_factor = 0.05 fuzz_val = (random.uniform(1 - fuzz_factor, 1 + fuzz_factor)) if random.random() &lt; 0.1: # 10% Chance to call itself again on the result. return fuzz(val * fuzz_val) else: return val * fuzz_val This would mean there is a 10% chance for any value to get fuzzed twice and 1% chance that it will be called 3 times (0.1% 4 times ad infinitum). Each time the fuzz value has a chance to get further away from the real value. This recursive loop could theoretically go on for infinity but in practice you shouldn't need to safe guard it. &gt; How could I change the specifics of the probability of another number being ahead of the other? As is the the fuzz_factor is the only variable that you would need to adjust. I set it up so that whatever percentage you chooses randomly from a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_\(continuous\)) (every value is equally likely) that can be applied negatively or positively to the real value. So in my example 0.5 could end up multiplying the rating by 95% or 105% or anything in between. I like this because it means higher values will be affected by fuzz more than the run of the mill players. &gt; How do I make the number range less wide, say having the lowest number being a 65 or something like that? You can probably deduce a way to do this from my answer above but there are two different ways I might approach it. If you want 65 to be the roughly the lowest and common, use my second example where I returned twice as many picks and then cut the list in half. The values should be something like: random.gauss(65, 6) If you want roughly 65 to be the lowest and rare then just return exactly the amount of picks you want. Values are probably: random.gauss(75, 3) You will have to experiment with different values to get it exactly the way you want it but those should be close. You can throw decimals at the function parameters to make smaller adjustments to the distribution. Glad I could be helpful. I still consider myself pretty green in python so it's nice to be able to share some of what I've learned to help someone else. Let me know if you have any other questions. I'd absolutely like it if you share how you end up solving the problem when you are done too. 
**Normal distribution** In probability theory, the normal (or Gaussian or Gauss or Laplace–Gauss) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate. The normal distribution is useful because of the central limit theorem. *** **Standard deviation** In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values. The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler, though in practice less robust, than the average absolute deviation. *** **Uniform distribution (continuous)** In probability theory and statistics, the continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of symmetric probability distributions such that for each member of the family, all intervals of the same length on the distribution's support are equally probable. The support is defined by the two parameters, a and b, which are its minimum and maximum values. The distribution is often abbreviated U(a,b). It is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X under no constraint other than that it is contained in the distribution's support. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Ask the people pushing for these changes whether they think communism is a good thing and capitalism is a bad thing. Then you'll realize it's actually more real than you thought.
__master__ and __slave__
PIL module, my method is to divide image into equally sized chunks, read each pixel in that chunk RGB value and then color every pixel with average RGB value of the whole chunk. It's actually working.
If the range is really large, use a permutation cipher on a ceil(log2(N))-bit counter and skip over outputs not smaller than N, otherwise just add the candidate elements to a list and randomly pick and remove each time.
You should stop reading conspiracy theories, lol.
You're right. Cultural Marxism should be dismissed and destroyed, not discussed.
Wow, these people were a lot more diplomatic than I would have been. My answer would have been "I do not subscribe to your politics. Request denied." Then I'd get called a racist and all the major news outlets would run a story about me, I'd lose my job, and I would have to step down from the community. I guess that's why I shouldn't take up any public leadership roles.
Huh? What are you even trying to say?
Do you happen to be modifying the list at any point in your code? That typically happens if you change the length midway thru.
Taxpayer. Considering that the Dollar isn't gold or silver anymore and it printed out of thin air, taxation is essentially free range slavery. The government's fair share of your income (i.e. stored labor) is zero. Anything else is far from fair and certainly not fucking shared.
But I don't live in a country that used to have slaves
# Needs a few PRs class thin_skinned(object): # Non-exportable; all objects derived, or instantiated are private. To instantiate from this class is to objectify an abstraction &amp; is illegal. def __init__(): raise ObjectifyingError: print("Buu-bye") print("objectifying a set") exit() class non_sensitive(thin_skinned(): # Easiest lines of code. pass A = thin_skinned() B = non_sensitive() print("Done") 
I think you misunderstood two common claims about python. Re the syntax, python doesn't have a lot of symbols like other languages so the syntax is minimal. And regarding the writing non code, Python code often reads like simple english, but it's still code. So it is likely you read those things but misunderstood what the posts were saying.
I just checked everything, and realized that I globalized "files". There were some identical "files" words inside the big block of code, which I changed to "filess" or something. Thanks!
The big deal is that you think you have a right &amp; ability to dictate speech of another individual. If a person decides to use the slave/master paradigm within their work do you think you now have a valid bug request? 
You'll need to get it a domain name then.
You can empower your hard drive by switching it from slave to master.
Global variables are evil and you get namespace collisions. I've never seen their point.
To help us help you troubleshoot, can you temporarily put a `print(file)` after this line? file = sys.argv[sys.argv.index('-f')+1] #input filenames after -f Just so we can see what the actual string looks like before you're parsing it. Maybe also `print(len(files))` before your second `for` loop.
Your flair reminds me of why Vermin Supreme is a fantastic politician -- he doesn't grant you permission to own a pony, Vermin specifies a legislative policy by which a pony will be provided!
Lol, as if there was 'a tech' in every lab... 
Oh. My. Gawd. So it begins...
I you could use argparse for easier argument parsing.
Please stop privatizing language. Besides to say your interpretation of 'really' is missing the crux of _private_ potential. Corrected: "But,but, _don't_ really mean it!" The difference is subtle you SOB.
I'll kill both, thank you very much.
This looks like a really amazing library ! Actually this kind of feature only (?) exists in PyCharm IDE. Do you plan to develop plugins for different IDE (ex: VS Code) in the mid/long-term ?
Can you please explain better the 'rape', 'work' relationship?
Om not "opposed" to the terminology but im equally baffoed at the backlash. Who caaaaares just let them change it, people are really blowing their tops about this. It's not a big deal. There's no reason to care this much.
&gt;Understanding these things makes you a better Python developer - a better developer overall. The reason I'm writing this series is because the docs don't do a good, comprehensive job of explaining variables. Who is your target audience here? I think I can say, with some confidence, that I am a pretty advanced Python programmer, and I also have an academic degree in the computer field. I have no idea how knowing about these three object categories (which I am pretty sure have never been brought up in any course I've attended) would help me become a better developer. Let's take another example, and then check your definitions: s = { Foo() } There is obviously a `Foo` object here, but which of your categories does it belong to? * Literal Is it only usable in the statement it is coded? *No, because you can obviously access it through the set* * Transient Is it temporary? *No. The object lives on inside the set* * Named No. There is no name that points to this object. The only way you can access it is by iterating over the set. I chose a `set` instead of a `list` here, because you can't even access the `Foo` object by indexing (i.e. `s[0]` if s was a `list`). Maybe now you see my confusion?
For my part, im not "opposed" to the terminology but im equally baffled at the backlash. Who caaaaares just let them change it, people are really blowing their tops about this. It's not a big deal. There's no reason to care this much.
D3 is hard as hell to use but there are many great wrapper libraries around it. If you want to make visualisations locally then just use matplotlib, if simple Web visualisations are your thing the bokeh/holoviews or plotly are great options too. 
I don't think you need the 'global files' line, that might be screwing things up. files is already accessible to all blocks below it. I would replace that with a print( j) to check whats going on. Also, you can replace for s in range(len(files): with for s, file in enumerate(files): then you don't need the file=files[s] line 
Ridiculous and taken completely out of context.
This language is very offensive to me, It hurts my feelings. I will switch to Scratch
So ... Mother and Fetus would be the most feminist version, right?
&gt; seems like most of the resistance is from the "what's next, are we gonna rename manhole to person hole, haha, and what's the deal with airplane peanuts" line of reasoning More specifically, it's that line of reasoning, but *very, very, serious*. People are treating this like it's the beginning of the end for Western society. But when you really think about a change like this, the costs of this move are largely trivial, while the benefits are at least plausible. At face value, it just really doesn't seem like this is worth getting so angry about.
No, because politics and culture. That's a difference. You wouldn't call your program Holocaust. You shouldn't call your compiler Stalin. Of course master/slave here has well established pre-existing use that is logical in context. But language changes and as we grow as a culture our language changes to reflect, for example, increased awareness of past atrocities. It's not that it hurts someone's feelings, its that it is fundamentally disrespectful to use an analogy to one of humanities worst atrocities to describe a dependency relationship of software constructs. If somebody was proposing this today as new terminology, you would have no problem with them being shut down.
\&gt; The \`set\_title\` method you gave is not setting the title based on a title object. It's a method that takes more than one parameter and generates a title object. I think you called it an artist or something. That method might also accept an artist, I'm not sure. In any case, it's not a simple setter, and so it has no business being written using a Python property decorator. So you'd write \`ax.set\_title(...)\` because it just happens that you can pass additional stuff to customize the title, but \`ax.facecolor = "r"\` because you can't? Frankly I'd rather have \`set\_foo()\` everywhere, at least it's consistent. \&gt; First of all, you shouldn't have that shorthand since it obscures what is really going on. \`foo.set(\*\*kwargs)\` is essentially defined as \`for k, v in kwargs.items: getattr(foo, f"set\_{k}")(v)\`. I don't think it's particularly illegible. Well, you may think that the \`set\_foo\` model is messed up (see previous point) but I don't think \`set\` adds complexity \*on top\* of that. (And no, there's no plan to add \`set\_title\_font\`, so there won't be \`ax.set(title\_font=...)\` either. \&gt; A good API is clear and concise. Well, I guess you'd be in favor of deprecating \`ax.plot(x, y)\` in favor of \`ax.add\_line(Line2D(x, y)); ax.autoscale\_view()\` (... approximately). Somehow I don't think this will help with the OP's issues with matplotlib :-) As always there's a balance to strike between practicality and purity.
I'm waiting for my university courses to begin and am on my 64th commit to the (presumably) renowned pure-Python PDF library [PyPDF](https://github.com/claird/PyPDF4). Early on August the maintainer announced to start working on PyPDF4 and I tried to give substantial help by deploying unit tests (there were *few*), making the code PEP 8-compliant, fixing bugs and adding implementations of some codec algorithms, optionally adding a few features etc. The project is in a renewing phase so the priority was on establishing a new sound basis for future development, although I'd like to implement some of the feature I have in mind soon.
And if you don't need `s` either, go with `for file in files:`
TIL, thx
I worked for a company about 10 years ago that was in a settlement over this. The company I worked for made computers and an employee sued the employee because when our machine booted it displayed the master and slave drives. Our part of the settlement was doing a bios rev to change the terminology to primary and secondary.
On a site note: consider using the argparse module.
These alt-right guys would be fine with that.
&gt; Are there any other canvasses? Why should I pick that one? Otherwise, yeah, this makes sense. Yes. - FigureCanvasPdf, FigureCanvasSvg, FigureCanvasPs for vector output. (To be fair, if you attach a FigureCanvasAgg and then call `savefig("foo.svg")`, we'll magically temporarily switch the canvas to a new FigureCanvasSvg for the purposes of saving. Why don't we do that if there's no canvas attached? Probably because no one requested it, and because the number of people who work with Figures not attached to *any* canvas is pretty small). - FigureCanvasQt5Agg, FigureCanvasTkAgg, etc. which are both a widget of the corresponding toolkit, and use the Agg renderer to update the widget on the toolkit's paintEvent/... (in fact, I now realize that the fact that you can build a Qt widget with `FigureCanvasQt5Agg(fig)` is probably the origin of the somewhat weird `FigureCanvasAgg(fig)` used to attach an Agg canvas to a figure...) - FigureCanvasCairo, which uses libcairo for output. libcairo can actually output both raster and vector formats, so it can generate pdf/svg/ps without switching to our handwritten canvases. - FigureCanvasQt5Cairo, FigureCanvasTkCairo, etc. which are like the interactive+Agg canvases, but using libcairo instead. (Below I use the term of "backend", which basically means the module that holds the Canvas and Manager classes and minor utility stuff, like how to actually start the corresponding GUI event loop. Or just read "canvas" instead.) Actually nowadays the cairo backend is pretty terrible (it's based on pycairo, so pure Python, so cannot match the performance of the native agg backend). But it serves as a good proof of principle that the interactive backends can easily switch from one renderer to another. (Historically, I think one of the important reasons to have a cairo backend is that GTK's drawing model is that their draw_event gives you a cairo canvas to draw on, so sure, you can always render the whole raster image with agg and send that to cairo, but it makes sense to implement things directly on top of cairo's API instead too). There used to be an OSX backend relying on macos' drawing toolkit but it fell into disrepair and got gutted, now the macosx backend uses Agg. There's my own https://github.com/anntzer/mplcairo which provides new (interactive and noninteractive) backends also based on libcairo, but now written in C(++); they have a number of advantages over matplotlib's builtin backends (but require a C++17 compiler to build). Jupyter-notebook and PyCharm also integrates Matplotlib with a custom backend. If you look around online, you'll also see OpenGL backends being proposed. &gt; That's consistent, but that's stateful and disgusting I think. We should be passing the figures to plt.show. I think a lot of people won't like that tbh if you make it required. OTOH if you want to make it possible to pass a list of figures to show, I guess that's PR-able (not saying it would get accepted, but it doesn't look too bad to me). &gt; My point is one of design. What happens if I try to create figures in other threads. I should be allowed to do that. And what if I call plt.show? This is one other reason that stateful methods are uncomfortable. Avoid global state as much as possible by returning the objects that manage that global state. I don't think Matplotlib makes any guarantees wrt thread safety. You need to realize that a lot of the underlying C-level libraries are thread-unsafe anyways (e.g. freetype, see https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-i18n-list/2014-December/msg00004.html -- dunno for Agg) so there isn't much interest in working on that. Again, you are welcome to look into it. &gt; You can deprecate the three parameter form. And you can at least document the GridSpec possibility in Figure.add_subplot. It's not even discoverable! I think the number of uses of `add_subplot(2, 2, 1)` (or even worse, `add_subplot(221)`) vastly outnumbers the number of uses of GridSpec. That's pretty gratuitiously breaking a *lot* of code out there in the wild. OTOH I agree that it should be better documented, I'll open an issue on the tracker for that... &gt; Finally, you should deprecate pyplot's add_subplot function since you have the method on Figure. Keep the interfaces as simple as possible. If pyplot's job is to manage and provide canvases, then let it do that and only that. Separation of concerns. As I said: don't. use. anything. from. pyplot. except. for. the. few. functions. listed. above. If you really want to handle the gazillion of complaints from breaking stuff from a 15y-old library, you're welcome to give it a try. (I'm not making things up, we did have quite a bit of pushback when we removed the `hold` system (inherited from MATLAB too -- basically whether a new plotting call should erase previous plots) from Matplotlib).
If you feel that this change is a bad thing, but you do not proudly self-identify as deplorable/alt-right/Gamergater/whatever, and terms like "white genocide", "cultural Marxism", "the SJWs" are not in your usual dictionary: Please take a look around you and look at the kind of people whose side you're on. Notice that they *are* exactly this kind of people. There's the side "we should do this" and the side "this seems unnecessary but whatever". These are normal sides to take. The ongoing rage-gasm that's trying to infiltrate the Python community right now is not. It's just a frigging change. Python has broken backward compatibility in far bigger ways than this before, and nobody is engaging in mass-downvote brigades against Python 2 reaching EOL. The change isn't political; this childish reaction to it is.
Ugh, argparse.... try docopt, as it has captured the zen of python much better.
Maybe some conflict is natural and inevitable, it is fine to disagree, to have discussions and sometimes be right, and other times be wrong. Meaningful resolution to every single conflict can be a hard sell for someone who realizes that different people have different beliefs, that those beliefs can be opposed or incompatible, and that people might be unwilling to change their beliefs only because someone else thinks they should. English is not my first language, and I like to choose words for their meaning. It's logical, simple, and I have tools like dictionaries to help me when I'm having trouble. I don't want to be burdened with someone else's inability to handle a few words and let something relatively simple turn into a game of politics every time I open my mouth. So I will keep using the first English word that comes to mind without care. So far I haven't met anyone in person who has ever been offended by any word I've used, and if I ever do I'll most likely nod and ignore them. Or maybe I'll just put a thick accent and ask them if they're being racist, depending on my mood.
&gt;but many of them will just say what you said: "And as far as someone being offended, so what?" I really hope they do. What you just wrote is part of the problem: You (as a white person) are busy isolating things that other people can get offended by, and then marching against it without any care for, well, anything! I don't think there is any faulty generalization in my statement. The connotations are not relevant to anyone but you, and to that you even admitted that you're not offended. So why is this wording really a problem? Nobody has spoken out, there is certainly no movement, and both semantically and functionally it has made sense, keep making sense and work as expected since the early days. If we keep on catering to everybody who is white knighting against unrelated words or concepts that could possibly if you try really really hard offend someone somewhere, then we will proceed to break society for nothing. And there is no clear path back from that. Or do you propose some magical criteria to determine what words are worth burning books and buildings over and which arent?
There's a lot to Python. You don't need to know it all, nobody does.
What a dumb thing yo do. 
What a dumb thing to do. 
Master and Mastern't?
Being uncomfortable doesn't mean those feelings are actually valid 
It's time we remove the offensive word dictionary from python! I use words and it offends me. P.s though it is time to call it what it is... A map!!!
I don't really think this is an entirely productive change but at the same time I'm very afraid of the massive amount of "anti-SJW" whining bullshitters in this thread spewing paranoid nonsense about how this is setting a bad precedent or what have you.
Well, technically it's correct. Your program executes, starts the processes and is finished while the processes are still running. As I'm normally using Python3, I don't know if it's present in Python2, but try to join your processes after starting them, like this: Co2thread.start() o2thread.start() Co2thread.join() o2thread.join() This should keep your program running until the two processes are finished.
yeah yeah yeah
my cum is similar to 1938
Seems a useless waste of time and effort addressing something that really isn't an issue. And these are the people that supposedly "lead" this language, a language that for actual programmers (note: not data scientists who use because of inertia and it reading like pseudo-code) is increasingly falling behind.
Those people probably think you're in to castration too (Unix).
So they can make it more usable.
Yeah, sorry, the above line should read *"removing __the need for__ `__future__`..."*.
Yes, fucking exactly. This is just another example of reactionaries making out something to be far bigger than it is to justify their political views. It's perfectly fine to think that this change is stupid, but it is not fine to use this as an excuse to bitch about SJWs and claim that political correctness is going to destroy the entire field of computer science.
Nahhh, maps have been used for millennia to distort typography for the benefit of western culture

Yes, this is also alternative. Just takes a while before started.
Would you mind clarifying or adding a /s? Not sure what you’re talking about.

thanks so much for the quick reply! I'll try that :) 
&gt; Any loopholes in the legalities? Seriously? How about don't try to DOS their server and throttle your requests.
To build on onto the other comments, look into `time.sleep(x)` to force pause scraping between iterations, and compute a decent request rate within the limits of what the resource will handle without returning a 429.
Stop trying the abuse the website. That response clearly states they don't want you making that many requests. If you live in the US there's a good chance you would be violating the CFAA by continuing to access the website after such a response. It's also just unethical regardless of any laws.

I think that they might have [overstated the safe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17984836) part. It looks like it might be useful for very specific kinds of refactoring on very large code bases with a specific kind of technical debt, but in almost all cases I think that time spent to manually do the refactoring willl be &lt; time spent automating with this tool. I also wouldn't feel safe running this without a comprehensive test suite. The risk of it breaking stuff is too high.
Yes we could try with N=10^3 or even N=10^6 (this would need code performance optimization first!). But before doing this, I think we should replace the model by a more realistic one, even for N=100: the average number of friends is normal distribution around 5. In reality, some famous people have a huge amount of friends, etc. See the two pictures here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network#Characteristics
Oh yes, right. I tried with Py 3.6 and same error. However it works flawlessly with Py 2.7. Any idea someone?
It's a struggle to even get people to update to Python 3 after ten years; good luck with your fork.
Brazil nuts used to be called nigger toes. Is changing that language policing? 
Haha, dumbass! That amused me, have yourself one upvote. :)
😅😆
*This*. All of the bullshit in this thread is manufactured political outrage, and these people have the gall to call *others* easily offended.
I’m just starting out with python; I made a simple snake game with the turtle module.

It seems to be using some sort of a custom solver, the code is [here](https://github.com/google/pytype/tree/master/pytype/typegraph). // Algorithm for solving the data flow graphs in typegraph.h. This uses DFS and // memoized backtracking to find use-def chains that explain one or multiple // variable&lt;-&gt;type assignments at a given point in the program. The performance // depends on the program being analyzed. Right now, we explore the whole state // space, i.e. analyze every possible order of variable assignments, but we // reserve the right to prune "uninteresting" parts of the use-def tree, to keep // complexity at bay. // We also use memoization to remember solutions to specific variable // assignments, and we do a "sanity" pass over the program to quickly rule out // assignments that are impossible because the bindings they use have fallen // out of scope. // // Even with these optimizations, it's possible to construct "pathological" // programs that would exhibit exponential running time when analyzed completely // (and hence, will need pruning of the tree). That's normal: the underlying // problem is NP complete; i.e., it's possible to reduce 3-SAT to a type // inference problem.

I'm taking a class right now that uses R which I haven't used since finishing my undergrad in 2012. Professionally, I have used Python for all my data wrangling. The timeliness of the is little gem is crazy.
I think, one point is not clear in your post: you show the intersection points of 2 lines and assume that it is the best one (maximizes the criteria), while it could be not the case. Different choices of "health units" for each medicine could give other solutions. Also, I think that it is worth mentioning, why you are only looking for the points located at the corners. Finally, there are two more implicit lines in your graph that you don't mention: x=0 and y=0.
&gt; On mobile my UI takes 10 seconds to load (a TextInput, a couple of buttons, and a ListView) Are you able to do anything during this time, or is it a blank screen? Is there anything you can do to speed it up? (Thank you for taking the time to write this up)
I’m sure there’s someone in the world that has built code that fully relies on the existence of ‘master’ and ‘slave’ in docstrings. If not, I’m going to make that someone me.
Kivy is cool but for whatever reason I couldnt get used to how the ui's that are built with it looks. Maybe ill have to revisit it sometime in the future
Thank you very much. This helps a ton
In 2.x, map returns a list (if I recall), but 3.x returns a generator, so Py3 doesn't know what to do. A numpy native solution (probably) works in both though!
So this is what people get offended by now? Jesus fuck how can someone have so much time to care about shit like that
I modified the original post. Now it works for py 3.4. 
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Agreed, that is very poor writing to those new to linear programming to focus on just that one intersection and say "yep, that is the answer". 
The precedent of making small changes when there's concerns about the sensitivity of language, and carefully weighing the downsides? (Again, [9100](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9100) was vetoed by Guido.)
This also explains why it seems that everyone else has more sex.
This audio is more reasonable IMO at 6:13 he mentions that the person that was shown is known for doxing people. If that's the case then I could get behind putting a ban on showing his content and it being a problematic thing. 
A lot has changed in R since 2012. Wickham is amazing.
Yeah, but the frogs are gay.
Development is kinda the same as Qt, building/deploying is harder imho, despite pyqtdeploy being a pretty nice tool.
I think that the biggest issue at hand is that we are having problems with having civil discussions on contentious subjects. Universities should be holding the candle in showing us how it's done and we should hope to propagate culture of civil discussion to the wider society. As for evidence about Peterson - I have none since I don't know the issue but I'm assuming that the prof in question was not throwing such accusation lightly (hope I'm not wrong). As of Peterson himself if wiki is to be believed he is a climate change denier which puts his position in a very questionable light for me.
There are a few other packages for LP in Python. But after evaluating a few of them, I eventually decided use XPress-MP (in the Mosel language) for teaching our MSc students, because none of them really offer an easy way to do all of the basics, eg evaluating activities, shadow prices, binding constraints, etc etc.
I was wondering if you'd do average RGB, awesome man!
Place him in whatever light you’d like. For me I’m still baffled by the reaction he gets out of people. But even if the video showed was of a completely detestable nature 1. as you pointed out a university is the place to objectively debate/criticize aspects of humanity, and 2. Making up claims of anonymous complaints is a control mechanism. For clarification the university has apologized and considered the endeavor significant overreach. Also ironically to what we’re discussing, Peterson has a decently valid defamation case open against the university as a result. Because after all, what’s written in Wikipedia or said by a professor does not simply automatically make it so, but it does impact the reception of the publisher bloc to an individual when the invoke Godwin’s law out of fear.
wrt your Foo example, there are two arguments that can be made 1. The Foo object is an integral part of s. It does not exist outside the context of s. It cannot be accessed outside the context of s. Therefore it should be treated simply as a part of s 2. Container elements are in fact individual objects. Therefore, container elements should be a fourth category (in adddition to variables, literals and transients) I initially argued 1, but I'm coming to understand that 2 is the correct answer. It is an anonymous object that persists within s Perhaps I should rewrite the line as "Every object in a Python program is either a variable or an anonymous object" and list literals, transients and container elements as subcategories of anonymous objects. Is this the only issue that you have with the article? Did you have any comments or criticism on the 'Structure of a Variable' section, or the 'Creating Variables' section? Can I assume that you agree with everything else in the 'Understanding Python Objects' section? &amp;#x200B;
Check out this game I made with kivy. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.missingclues.missingclues It's actually 3 games in one because the levels employ completely different mechanics. I've since used kivy for a couple of other projects too.

That's what I'm hearing around the water cooler. I have perhaps an irrational attachment to Python now though. I've just written so much code...
For others interested in pyQT I found this https://is.muni.cz/th/q66th/openmobility_2013-python_and_qt_for_android.pdf
Any idea how to speed up the loading time? Is it because I build with debug options on?
Good point, I forgot that docs aren't necessarily hidden
“As a white person” SJW ALERT
sorry, i'm not native english speaker. Can a mod modify the title?
Good stuff. 
I think we agree in general. One more loose thought connected to the issue - I remember at uni when one guy presented some ridiculous conspiracy theories and as ridiculous as it was I think that it's good that he got to present his views and then got corrected on what is a valid academic argumentation. And yeah going in the censorship direction is worrying - like his quesiton about showing a white supremacist parade (or whatever the example was) - if the university is not a place to figure out why we have people after WW2 holding such views, what draws them in, what actual views they hold - then we are doomed to not solve that problem.
gstreamer. It has Python bindings but also comes with a pretty steep learning curve. Either way gstreamer is _the_ tool for this job. 
Depends on the task. Python is used extensively by google among many other languages. You won’t find a big company that uses one language exclusively all will run certain things with whatever fits the job best. That being said, because python is easy, it is used very commonly, so it has a lot of support and can practically do anything other than writing interactive webpages , which (for all practical purposes at a beginner level) need JavaScript. C/C++ remains the fastest language but it is very difficult compared to python. 
The best way I found was to not initialize all the widgets at once and instead have just enough to load the first screen, or in my case, the game menu. If you try my game out you might see how it loads up and then watch the time it takes to load a level the first time compared to all subsequent times.
Anyone can submit a bug request for anything. It's up to the maintainer to decide whether they want to accept. In this case the person also provided a pull request too so no extra work had to be done. It's not impeding on anyone's speech. You can keep using the word slave. But anyone is free to say, "hey this is maybe a little insensitive. Is there merit in changing it?". The person who submitted was not rude or pushy. They just provided their point of view and put in the leg work. To put it to an extreme, if you used a racial slur and I said it wasn't cool, does that make me in the wrong? Why does this anger you so much? It's a minor change that at most makes some people happier with minor shifts in the lexicon towards more inclusive language, and at worst has no effect on anyone at all. So why are you so upset? Are you so attached to the concept of slaves that you are willing to die on that hill for it? 
No one is burning dictionaries or removing words from vocabularies. This is a change to the core language, not a mandate that all Python developers change their terminology.
You can see various languages including Python have been used in github. For example, Google, Netflix in github. 
Please take the tech industry away from California
It's dangerous to get too attached to a language. It can stop you from using the right tool for the job. I've got a similar hangup about Julia, but I realise I need to overcome it as it's quickly becoming the best for optimisation and differential equation solving. I firmly believe that there is something like the no free lunch theorem for programming languages. The more general they become the worse they are for specific problems, and the bigger the benefit is to switch to a domain specific one. The tidyverse has made data munging an exploratory data analysis really good in R, so perhaps that's what you should use it for. I'm a native Python coder and it took me way longer to figure this out in Pandas than in R.
Not everyone in tech lives in California and is cool with this crap
Because it is the terminology already established. the "sjws" are the ones making the change
Yeah I don't get that crap, race and sex got nothing to do with programming...
Don't worry, I just got the green light! As soon as I've checked a few things (add a LICENSE, a proper README, ...) I'll push the code to GitHub. An important lesson to learn from this project is a design mistake I made: I used a different model/database table for each taxonomic level (Family / Genus / Species / ...). That becomes very inefficient/complex when you need to access this data as a tree (with added complications such as "optional" taxonomic levels). Something like (django-mptt)[https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt] would probably be much better. That's something I'll need to refactor. 
Why would anyone be offended by the term "slave"?
I'm writing a little tool to extract unformatted data tables from PDFs for a coworker
What about tableau 
I like it! Nice job! Did you learn all of the stuff through your class? Did you use any books or tutorials at all? I ask because I am pretty comfortable with django but I want to get into some of the new JS stuff. Also what library are you thinking of using for your charts? I'm making something for tracking spending and I think I'm going to use highcharts.js to make the line graphs.
lektor looks like a good option
They changed it to parent/worker because... parents are in charge of workers?
The article is better described as outlining the role of fintech, followed by the pros of using Python/Django. It doesn’t provide any information on how to build anything. 
&gt; can practically do anything other than writing interactive webpages I know it's more of a stunt but… Hey! Somebody did it. ;) https://brython.info/
I don’t want to be a dick. But this is not real time. 
Regrettably, not everyone in California is cool with it either. Making tech a more accommodating and friendly field is going to take years.
Try out kivymd! Kivy MD uses Google's material design and it looks 1000% better.
Python is one of the top languages used right now. I've used it professionally for 5 years now. 2 years on video game web services for AAA games, 3 years in devops. When it comes down to what language is "faster", people aren't usually paying attention to the language's strengths and weaknesses. They're making too broad a claim. To understand when to pick Python you have to understand its constraints as well as technologies that help get around those constraints. You have to understand [multiprocessing vs multithreading](https://medium.com/@bfortuner/python-multithreading-vs-multiprocessing-73072ce5600b), [concurrency vs parallelism](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/concurrency-vs-parallelism.html), [the global interpreter lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), etc. You'll hear python is single threaded, you'll hear it's slow, etc. It's all relative to what you're doing. Web frameworks have come a long way. You'll want to look at technologies like [Gevent/Greenlets](http://www.gevent.org/intro.html), [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado), [Cython](https://cardinalpeak.com/blog/faster-python-with-cython-and-pypy-part-2/), etc. You'll see how various shortcomings are overcome to build great things in Python.
Though you’re right, on the whole I seriously doubt that the changing of a docstring will impact on people’s code
I think the loading time is due to loading libraries in android. Ive got my app working on ios and android and the ios loads WAY faster. I think someone was looking into loading libraries differently in Android to speed it up but I cant seem to find the github thread again.
first of all the mention of the name makes this seem like a robot/copypasta. in case you're a real person - so not only are you wasting time, you're wasting money that could have actually developed solutions that helped people?
the guy who put this request in probably sucked at programming and wanted to be famous, so he could be mentioned for regexing some replace all crap.... time for another language.
Screw it, I'll just say it. Do you have a problem with removing words like master and slave? I don't care, but I admit some people do. If you care and you're for it, you're happy. If you don't, you need to look deep inside yourself. Racism is a thing and it's a problem in every society. Alternatively, is it that you have a problem with open source projects having people in charge? There is/was a BDFL, but he/she never promised to encourage democracy and debate on decided topics. Print is a function. Get over it.
I would assume it's because you're instantiating the entire app at once, when you start the app. I went from around 1 minute 30 seconds load time to 2 seconds, once I implemented lazyloading of the screens. https://github.com/rafalo1333/KivyLazyloadingExample This is a good example of how to do it. https://github.com/cruor99/sadpandareader/tree/develop/app There it is in action, somewhat :)

I totally agree. I've been forcing myself to use R for a few things. All things considered it's really a pretty intuitive language. 
Mods can't do that, other than deleting and asking you to resubmit. But it's a pedantic point and any English speaker knows what you mean, so don't worry about it. Fewer is technically correct because you can count a discrete number of friends, while less would be correct if it was a continuous "uncountable" quantity like you are trying to spend less time online, trying to drink less, or you have less respect for the US gov't under Trump. It's also confusing because in the opposite direction we use "more" for the countable and uncountable conditions.
I’ll bypass the reading- just downvote 
I figured the SBC reference would be enough to tip off the fact that it was being sarcastic.
Ill have to look into that thanks
For sure. And “fast” may be meaningless in lots of contexts. Numpy is a wrapper around highly tuned math libraries, so while Python may be “slow”, it’s mainly coordinating actions in faster code. I use Python for lots of data engineering stuff where we’re running queries on joined tables with a few billion rows each. Python generates the queries, then waits for half an hour while they run. We don’t spend much time trying to optimize the Python parts of that workflow.
Well sure, you could make an anal branch if you wanted to, but that's not exactly what this thread seems to be talking about.
"American" is not a race. Don't be ignorant. And yes Europe is full of these problems, I never denied it. But Americans have a tendency to identify themselves by their race while other nations identify themselves by their nationality. 
Yeah, I was pretty comfortable with Python before taking the class, but I learned everything else in the class, including Django, Javascript, and the various frameworks I used. The class did a great job teaching a lot of the material so I didn't really need to supplement it with books or tutorials. I did do a lot of googling when I got stuck though. I'm not sure when I'll actually get around to making the additions I wrote about in my documentation haha. But, I was thinking about using D3.js for both types of graphs. Highcharts.js looks like an easier to use and better alternative though!

Thank you for trying it out and for the encouraging words! I've never tried an animated GIF. I would assume that you will have to do the animating. I've been playing with Canvas Element animations which is what I did in the Matplotlib demos (e.g. the ping demo). The most recent attempt at animating a canvas as the Demo_Pong program. Take a look at that program for one way to animate canvases. Let me know how it goes, I'm happy to help. Log an Issue on the GitHub if you think there's a bug or if a new feature is needed in order for this to be done. 
Learning Python by Mark Lutz should see you right. 
I have no clue why the other person is calling you racist for a giving neutral point of view, but I get the feeling this same tendency of people to jump to conclusions ("You're racist!") instantly without a thought or prior knowledge about someone is a reason we are here today. People are quick to fall prey to fallacies like straw-manning or 'black or white'. If were all nice to each other and did not identify by ourselves by race, the world might be a better place but I guess that's a fantasy.
Personally I think "everything is an object, and sometimes they have names" is about as difficult this has to be. Unfortunately I only skimmed the article, so I can't tell you much about the rest of it. Sorry.
Maybe you’ve heard of Dropbox? YouTube? Netflix? 
Thanks for the writeup :) kivy dev here, always interested in what people build with it and what the painpoints are. Others answered well to the loading time complain, loading python takes some time, but after that it depends on how you load your UI, i also see you used ListView, if you have more than a few items, you should really look into RecycleView, which is a *lot* faster, and more flexible, and it's been very stable for the last year and half at least, so pretty safe to invest into. You problably want to lazy load modules too, importing everything at startup can add up pretty fast.
Dropbox is so deep in python they hired BDFL himself.
omg I'm out of this conversation - thanks for the lulz.
I'm hitting 404
I'm not angry. Im litterally laughing ... Fuck me. 
python 3 is the perfect example of idealism over reality. anyone making anything looking to take the easy way out(read all noob programmers in python) will always choose 2 over 3 coz of compatibility issues and the large amount of libraries that have niche quirks they can't figure out it's the reason i stopped trying to follow anything in pythonic dev beyond quick prototyping and scripting, the language is schizo
Is this real? Is this the future of Python without Guido?
i don't lose anything, i moved onto .net core for apis and react/js for web/desktop. python is fun but it's not that fun
Very interesting. Apparently there was a debate and “slave” was changed to “worker” and “helper”. But I think there is a new problem. Imagine if slave owners began to call their slaves workers and helpers. The new terms lessen the ugliness of slavery and diverts attention away from its violence. The context here matters. If the original key words for python were meant to glorify slavery, then the terms should be changed. If the original terms were chosen in order to reflect a technological relationship between systems, then it should be understood in context. The context being that code doesn’t glorify actual real life slavery or the historical practice. And that code doesn’t possess the same human rights or dignity as human beings. The real issues here are about, Diversity, Political Correctness, and Sensitivity in the programming world. Programmers tend not to be representative of the general population in the US, although if you were to count programmers from Asia and Africa as well as Latin America you might come to a different conclusion. Promoting diversity in hiring in Silicon Valley is important. But I think the real solution is first improving America’s education system across the board in all communities. Then breaking the monopoly that Silicon Valley companies have and allowing different communities in America to be more competitive. That is how we achieve true diversity. Begging or shaming companies into hiring people of color doesn’t actually change pre-existing structures within companies. Often times promoting Diversity and Political Correctness is simply an expedient tactic that companies use to avoid real change. 
There's a ACLU supported prison strike against that 13th amendment provision right now which could do with some help. I'm not sure how many of the people advocating this PR are supporting or even aware of the strike but I suspect it approximates zero.
I did a try to genetic algorithm too. Very interesting, simple and powerful algorithm :)
Why Go?
While this phenomenon will still occur when friendships have uniform probabilities like in this simulation, I think the effect will be magnified in real life situations when friendship probabilities are non-uniform (and likely have power-law behavior). Some people are super friendly, learn everyone's name, try to be everyone's friends, welcome new people, are great listeners, actually care about people, etc. If you had an isolated community of ~100 people they may become friends with basically everyone on a network like facebook. Similarly, some people are jerks who are unpleasant to be around and don't make any effort to make friends (or become friends with them on social networks). The easiest way to understand the friendship paradox is that when you have graphs that aren't constructed to be symmetrical (where everyone has an equal number of connections), the popular nodes (the ones with the most connections) will be over-represented in their neighboring nodes' average number of connections. E.g., if you have a social network with 1500 users and an globally average number of connection per user of 100. Let's say one person has lots of connections (say 195) and another has a few connections (say 5); the value of 195 boosts up their 195 different neighbors average connection count; while the user with just five connections only lowers the average for just 5 neighbors.

I think part of the change actually makes some sense. The worker process... does the work. Master/slave is used in so many different ways in computing that it can actually make the relationship between the master and slave process a bit ambiguous. I disagree with the choice of "parent" to replace "master" though. "Master" and "slave" fit together, as do "parent" and "child". "Parent" and "worker" sound a bit weird when used together and doesn't make the relationship immediately apparent.
This is rich. This is exactly what my company did recently regarding how to refer to it's terminals. I don't agree with the change in my organization, and I certainly don't agree with it here. In fact it's been such a great change that I've only seen a handful of people actually change the terminology.
Wow Bob and David predicted this lol https://youtu.be/bXwSXpzJDbM
i work at google, can confirm mostly use python, but also using java for my specific job.
It's amazing how we live in a society that keeps increasing hardcore instances of outright bigotry. BLM succeeds little and instead Blue Lives Matters gets further laws to insulate police. Neo-nazi's rally and kill people. Cheeto is in the White House. The GOP dominates the POTUS, Congress (both houses), SCOTUS, a majority of state governorships and state parliments. But thank god Hollywood and Silicon Valley are here to pave to way forward with petty, feel good, stupid shit. This will surely fix things.
I pretty sure they need to rename [cumsum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) in numpy, I'm sick of monkey-patching my code with a function called jizzbizz.

Some optimizations: Instead of ```python M = np.zeros((N, N)) # matrice du "graphe d'amitie". M[i,j] = 1 &lt;=&gt; les individus i et j sont amis for i in range(N): for j in range(i): if random.random() &lt;= 0.05: # probabilite pour que deux personnes au hasard dans la population M[i, j] = 1 # soient amies; ceci peut etre change par une autre loi de proba M[j, i] = 1 friends = {i: set([j for j in range(N) if M[i, j] == 1]) for i in range(N)} ``` ```python friends = {i: set(j for j, r in enumerate(np.random.random(i)) if r &lt;= 0.05) for i in range(N)} for i in range(N): for j in friends[i]: friends[j].add(i) ``` And instead of ```python S = 0 for i in range(N): x = len(friends[i]) # nombre d'amis de l'individu i if x &gt; 0: y = np.mean([len(friends[j]) for j in friends[i]]) # nombre moyen d'amis des amis de l'individu i if y &gt; x: S += 1 # encore un cas ou les amis de i ont en moyenne plus d'amis que i lui-meme ! ``` ```python v_friends = friends.values() filtered_1 = filter(lambda x: len(x) &gt; 0, v_friends) mean = ((np.mean([len(friends[j]) for j in x]), len(x)) for x in filtered_1) S = sum(1 for x in mean if x[0] &gt; x[1]) ``` On my laptop, I gain a lot (from 45s to 13s for 8000 people)

I always thought Victor Stinner was a smart guy. I had no idea he became a virtue signaling idiot. He deserves all the mockery he got.
It is enforcing a negative connotation on the words. So even if you use "Master" in a *different* sense, it is now *still* bad because of the super-contrived *new* meaning of "Master". 
Haha, *so* original.

Master also just means boss in plain english. Master/slave is ironically just US connotations enforcing US dominance one the world. Guido should never had left the sanity of of Holland.

already did about an hour ago, got hundreds of views and no solution. 
Nice.
&gt;I understand why there is some controversy I don't even get why it is a controversial. Like any Pro-Slavery people are going to start programming in Python BECAUSE it uses terms like "master" and "slave". Neither of thous words discriminates against anyone or makes things less inclusive (in fact if they do make you not participate then maybe that is in fact a good thing, less crazy is always better)
Next complaint will be that some people are orphans and don't have parents so it is insensitive to call something a parent. Also some people can not work so naming things as worker is discrimination and it is capitalistic also. 
&gt;"everything is an object, and sometimes they have names" That may be fine for somebody with your level of experience. But "sometimes they have names" is more complicated than it sounds. Even "everything is an object" is, as I note, only mostly true - individual statements and expressions are not objects, they are how you *create and use* objects. That is not self-evidently obvious to all developers. My goal in the articles is reasoning from first principles. In order to do so, I have to establish a common understanding, and a common vocabulary. I cannot assume any prior understanding. Thanks for your feedback. It was helpful.
Continuing trying to learn Django/web dev concepts. God I'm trash at that stuff...I can do .NET, Python, desktop apps, plugins, scripts...but fuckin web work man - I'm near useless.
There's also this entertaining thread on the Python ideas mailing list about changing some of the wording in the Zen of Python: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-September/053365.html
Does pyqtdeploy build for Android? I know that Qt has support for Android, but have never been sure if PyQt does.
The biggest hurdle for me is that (last I checked) it is not installable on Fedora. They have not updated their SDL hooks, and refuse to compile on the newer version that Fedora ships.
Lot of edge lords getting offended in these comments. Slavery was a really shitty institution in history (and in some parts of the world still exists today). We don’t need to be referring to it in software engineering. That’s all there is to this. There are plenty of other words we can use instead of slave. 
&gt;The downside is that you have to use pyqt, which means GPL or commercial license. Aren't those the only two options for Qt anyways?
no conspiracy theory was mentioned here.
No. The Clash. 
Look, someone transcribed an introductory lesson from someone else’s course without adding a single iota of new material.
&gt; We don’t need to be referring to it in software engineering. Well considering it *isn't* a reference to historical slavery...
Changing the term inheritenance because everyone should get a fair chance. 
Disturbs me, your flair does.
We do have orphan processes... and zombie processes as well. Honestly we should just get rid of all names for anything. It would solve the hardest problem in CS if nothing had names.
&gt; Master/Slave describes exactly how that relationship works -- the master is in control and dictates what the slave does. This is NOT in any way saying or implying "We use these words to describe relationships between software and/or hardware components, therefore we believe the social construct of slavery is valid and good". You're tearing down a strawman here because no one is arguing that using the terms Master and Slave means that you support slavery. Surely you can see how Master Slave terminology is a little unsettling? I'm used to it now but I remember being a bit shocked when I first learned about the terms. I can definitely see how it would make some people who are closer to the victimizing effects of slavery hurt on the inside. Why would you want to make someone feel that way? It's not hard to change some documentation.
Wait, so you're saying all these years of "killing processes" hasn't created a generation of murderers?
the outrage culture is more ppl reacting to this than the actual change at this point
is an idiomatic syntax description that litterally is only cultural in the first place so if python wants to remove an idom from usage, why does anyone care? are we serious mad about a find and replace operation?
youre angry about find and replace?
Master is to Slave as Parent is to Child was the point... The new convention is retarded because the terms don't match. 
i'm tired of this story. i don't care about the change and there's just this outrage factory going where people try to make this bigger than it is
&gt; Surely you can see how Master Slave terminology is a little unsettling? It wasn't unsettling at all until I moved to the US. Then after a few years here .... its suddenly become unsettling.

Who made Victor Stinner the new BDFL?
If you wanted up votes you should have been outraged that the word's were change, not have a reasonable argument why they should.
Do you want to change the name of fruit punch because punching someone is wrong?
Look at this idiot..... like software terminology is referring to slavery. 
Thank you for the response. &gt;“For diversity reasons, it would be nice to try to avoid ‘master’ and ‘slave’ terminology, which can be associated with slavery,” Victor Stinner, a developer with the open source software company Red Hat, wrote. From the article. Yes, you are right that it doesn't say "support slavery". But it *is* a direct correlation, it is establishing a relationship directly to historical slave trade. There are other mentions in this article of the same thing. &gt;Surely you can see how Master Slave terminology is a little unsettling? If I called my servers whitey and blackie and used Master/Slave to reference them, then yes I could see how it would be unsettling. Other than that, honestly no I do not understand why people take offense to these words. &gt;Why would you want to make someone feel that way? Are you now stating that using the terms means you're trying to make someone feel bad? &gt;It's not hard to change some documentation. I would argue it's not hard to think critically about context, which then removes the need to change documentation. 
How far back does the master/slave terminology go? I checked wikipedia but they don't give a date for first usage.
Nothing. They're just mad about change, and you got caught in the wrong thread to have an opinion that language changes over time. Even though it does.
the black/whitelist already happened https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/3507
I think it makes sense. Rather it is puzzling to me that why people are so opposed to the idea of changing the names. Programmers usually brag saying that, they are changing the world through their work. But for this issue, the way they are reacting means that, they don't have any respect for the society as it is. Not only that, they don't care as long as the bubble they live in is comfortable. &amp;#x200B; The concept of the word Master/Slave comes from a very past that we don't want to go back to. To do that, we have to learn from our mistakes. When you do that, it's a symbolism that the computing world, care about the society. &amp;#x200B; The people who are crying wolf for the terminologies, if you can't solve a problem to change something, they simply should not be in this domain. If a programmer can't solve a naming problem, what's the point of a programmer?!
What's the source?
Because he's going?
Heh, one of the comments in that thread is calling out the use of 'whitespace' in the codebase.
&gt; But I think there is a new problem. Imagine if slave owners began to call their slaves workers and helpers. The new terms lessen the ugliness of slavery and diverts attention away from its violence. Couldn't you make an equal argument that the practice of using that term for mundane technical relationships between parts of a system is what's lessening the ugliness of slavery and diverting attention away from its violence? &gt; The context being that code doesn’t glorify actual real life slavery or the historical practice. And that code doesn’t possess the same human rights or dignity as human beings. But code doesn't care about these terms – this *is* about human beings communicating. And they're communicating about technology, which is why falling back on terms that carry an immense historical ballast should be unnecessary, imo.
&gt;Surely you can see how Master Slave terminology is a little unsettling? No. &gt; I can definitely see how it would make some people who are closer to &gt;the victimizing effects of slavery hurt on the inside. I can't. When my house has termites and a truck pulls up that says "Exterminator", my Jewish neighbors don't scream "Oh my God, Hitler tried to EXTERMINATE the Jews!" and faint. Context, people... context. No one legitimately feels upset when they see master/slave terminology, or killing processes, etc. They're just looking for something to make a fuss about. 
Wow that went from zero to “It’s not my fault that I don’t hire black people” in a matter of seconds.
Swastika only has one connotation. "Master" and "Slave" do not. Tearing down Confederate statues and flags? Makes sense. Changing the word "slave" in Python documentation? That's ridiculous. 
Usually because it's a small number of people on Twitter that are complaining about it for internet points, then both sides take their bullshit to the repo where it is locked, it spills over to various drama subreddits and the circlejerk continues. Now the majority of the people that don't give a shit about outrage over words used in a programming language because they are smart enough to understand context end up having to change their code for no real reason. Now there is one change pointlessly made they can get extra credit for the removal of whitelist and blacklist no doubt.
I personally like this suggestion from the Redis repo: https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3185#issuecomment-213086984 I wish Python would have changed it to that.
&gt; The concept of the word Master/Slave comes from a very past that we don't want to go back to. Master/Slave is not a reference to slave trade, it is a reference to the relationship between resources/devices. 
&gt; No one legitimately feels upset when they see master/slave terminology, or killing processes, etc. Ah yes, the good old, "everyone who disagrees with me can't be genuine." 
Sure. One simple non-uniform model would be to sort number by how friendly, so probability of i and j being friends is `C/(i + j)` for some constant C and then truncate it to fall in the range of 0.5% to 50%. I'm truncating at the upper end, so the chance of user 0 and user j being friends under a model 50/(i+j) isn't 50/j, which would be 100%. (I truncated at the lower end too to avoid users with zero/one friends, but didn't really need it for range of constants used). import numpy as np, random def single_trial(prob_function, N): M = np.zeros((N, N)) # matrix of the "graph of friendship".

alrite, this is getting ridiculous. SJWs are trying to take everything from us. they literally wont stop. well fuck them, fuck them up their asses. i hate them so fuckin much.
Ah, good! All the wrongs have been righted in the world. We may now all sleep peacefully because the SJW's are making the world safe again. 
Programs have rights too! #notallprograms #metoo #sjwcancer Like and retweet to join the circle jerk!
&gt; The concept of the word Master/Slave comes from a very past that we don't want to go back to. Has the usage of Master and Slave in computing had *any* affect (positive or negative) to the amount of slavery in the world? Should we remove all words from the lexicon that can be associated with bad things in the past? Master and Slave are not inherently offensive words. Words like shit, fuck, bonerforest are all intended to be offensive and it is their purpose. Those words should not be in the language. Using Master and Slave to describe a device relationship does not endorse human slavery. Master and Slave are no inherently offensive words. So if the new standard is not the using the actual purpose of the word, but rather offense taken by using the word in a *completely different context* where do we draw the line? We now know that Master and Slave are on the bad side of the line, so we have to determine if words like Kill, Touch, Mount, Penetration, etc fall on one side of this line or another. Changing a standard from something distinguishable like the actual dictionary definition of the word into how much someone's feeling are hurt makes everything ambiguous. Who's feelings matter more? How many people have to be upset in order to make a change to decades-old terminology. How do you measure how offensive a word is, especially when the offense has nothing to do with this particular use case but a different application altogether. I don't care about changing the words, they can be Manager and Worker, Controller and Controllee, or Pimp and Ho. The problem is the justification for doing so is based on such flimsy logic that it is begging to be abused.
Not to mention that it's been used elsewhere as well. I remember needing to designate master/slave hard drives when I got my second drive, for example. 
&gt; Imagine if slave owners began to call their slaves workers and helpers. This is what modern slavers do. They're not slaves, they're just workers who've gotten so[ indebted to their employers that they'll never be able to pay it back](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/uob-vo071618.php). They're not slaves, they're [house helpers whose passports we keep under lock and key](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/hong-kongs-indentured-servants.html).
Excellent points. Thank you.
How can a mature brain see the words slave and master in code and assume this is some kind of support or reminder of the shitty slave trades that happened and are still on going. The word only carries the meaning you give to it in that case you got it wrong. Does the change of the word alter any performance in running the code? No, so that's why people are upset at having to change it not because they are supporters of the slave trade. Sure some people will just see it as a chance to argue with those proposing the change, but honestly I hope they all go away as well
Thanks for the response as well. I think there's a good chance I can get you to empathize with me on this. &gt; From the article. Yes, you are right that it doesn't say "support slavery". But it is a direct correlation, it is establishing a relationship directly to historical slave trade. There are other mentions in this article of the same thing. There is naturally a direct correlation between historical slavery and the discomfort people feel when they see the terms Master and Slave used in this context. That relationship is exactly the reason it would be a small (very small) step in the right direction to stop using these terms. &gt; If I called my servers whitey and blackie and used Master/Slave to reference them, then yes I could see how it would be unsettling. Other than that, honestly no I do not understand why people take offense to these words in this context. If slavery had lasted into the technology age we live in then calling servers 'whitey' and 'blackie' might very well have been what we'd be arguing about right now. But that's besides the point. When you say you can't understand why people take offense in this context I genuinely believe you. I just want you to know that they do actually take offense. They do actually feel bad and weird about it. Then they feel bad for even feeling bad or weird about it, and maybe they wonder why their coworkers don't feel bad about it - and what's wrong with them? Are they really that different? And it hurts. It ever so slightly hurts for reasons that are impossible to explain if you haven't lived their life. The question becomes: Is it ok to hurt people? Sometimes the answer is yes. Sometimes the exchange is worth it for everyone as a whole. Sometimes you've gotta tear down a house to build a highway. But is this one of those times? I personally don't think so. &gt;Are you now stating that using the terms means you're trying to make someone feel bad? If you use terms that make people feel bad then you have to accept that you've made a choice that results in pain for someone else. I wouldn't call that 'trying to make someone feel bad'. &gt; I would argue it's not hard to think critically about context, which then removes the need to change documentation. Telling every single person who reads the documentation to think critically about the context isn't going to erase the psychological effects of hundreds of years of slavery. Changing the documentation in one place might ever so slightly help the next hundred years though. 
Good. This is an overdue change. That there are so many comments here voicing anger and opposition to this simple, technically irrelevant change is disturbing. It indicates our community still has a long way to go in terms of equality, as well as in respecting other cultures and the struggles they go through.
except the terminology master-slave has been in wide use in electronics and computer engineering for a long time, has a specific use and was never in reference to slavery. So it has nothing to do with what you're saying. 
A lot of slave owners preferred to use the term "servants" --- a neighbor when I was younger was the son of a freed slave --- he was a sharecropper on my great-grandfather's farm alongside my grandfather, and what little he would say of his father and his situation noted that the problem was how folks were treated, and how they were considered to be property, in a direct contravention of the statement of the self-evident truth that "...all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Q: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? A: Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg. _Twelve Years a Slave_ by Solomon Northup should be required reading in schools.
It's pretty cool how people can whine for years and then as soon as they get their way they start accusing everyone else of whining LOL
Removing the Classess to promote equality.
The first and second for loops can be removed entirely. They don't really do anything. Here's a hint (I don't want to do your homework for you): Read the entire file and split it into a list of integers. Then you can operate on that list.
Don't forget "odd" numbers. How about "differently even"?
There are probably other things that could benefit from waiting until the app is loaded in to finally do. A trick I use is to have the init method of the root widget contain a Clock.schedule\_once(self.finish\_init). The way Clock works without a set timer, is that it waits until the next available frame to do the thing. That is generally when the user is done with the initial load/splash, and is already inside the app. If you ever throttle your internet, you’ll see Facebook doing something similar which is a neat trick - displaying a wireframe of how the ui may end up looking, before adding the proper widgets or populating it with data. I’ll try and see if I can find a good article on it, and edit it in if I find it. My contact information should be on my github page, and I’m almost always in the #kivy irc, so don’t be afraid to get in touch for more discussions or tips :)
Because we can't understand Prolog yet
I wish the people who proposed this change had your same attitude.
I am talking about it becoming unsettling only when you moved to the US. I don’t have a dog in this fight one way or the other. One point it is silly to change something like this however the other side is just as rediculous for holding onto a tradition for the sake of it. 
This is very american. Who else cares about the word slave considering slavery is still alive? 
&gt;The concept of the word Master/Slave comes from a very past that we don't want to go back to. What do you mean? The Islamic World is still here and their enslavement of non-Muslims is not going anywhere. CNN did an interesting video last year where they actually attended a slave auction in Libya where a slave was sold for 90 dollars. And the Arabs used to raid the coasts of Europe for slaves from the formation of Islam until the Reconquista.
Donglegate was funny. Heh... \*dongle\* lol
who whined for this change
I live in India and Swastikas are everywhere. Get over it you racist scums, taking away my Indian religious symbols! 
Without being even remotely onboard with any of these changes, I would agree with you that `white/black` prefixes is far more insensitive than `master/slave`.
The meaning of the swastika still depends on the context. This stuff is complicated. https://www.tripsavvy.com/why-are-there-swastikas-all-over-asia-3498922
that's a slippery slope argument tho
Where is master/slave used meaning something else than master/slave?
i agree w the change. seems like a net positive, regardless of the scaremongering ppl are engaging in here
I'm not exactly sure how programming terms would influence culture. How bout we all treat each other with respect, regardless of the color of our skin or religion. Python terms aren't changing that. 
&gt;i agree w the change I disagree with the change because I detest that *your* outrage factory was successful just like gay marriage was successful even though it doesn't make any sense.
&gt;There is naturally a direct correlation between historical slavery and the discomfort people feel when they see the terms Master and Slave used in this context. I disagree. That correlation is *manufactured* by people that want to be upset about it. That is why I called it outrage culture. &gt;If you use terms that make people feel bad then you have to accept that you've made a choice that results in pain for someone else. I wouldn't call that 'trying to make someone feel bad'. So then why should I be held responsible for people being upset over something that doesn't matter, *especially* when that is not the intent nor the context? &gt;Telling every single person who reads the documentation to think critically about the context isn't going to erase the psychological effects of hundreds of years of slavery. Again, I would argue the people that have "psychological effect of hundreds of years of slavery" should be able to recognize and disconnect the two. &gt;Changing the documentation in one place might ever so slightly help the next hundred years though. Completely disagree. You're forcing *everyone* to change an innocuous naming convention on the off chance that an *extreme few* feel "ever so slightly hurt" about it. If anything, I would say you're *hurting* the "healing" by forcing this change through. 
badly worded on my part. I mean to say that the white/black terminology is influenced from existing culture
The people who advocated for it. It was whining from the start and the reaction to it is justified because we need to make sure whining is not rewarded.
Strange how such a small change can cause such a great reaction 
Americentrism at it's finest
Good Lord, you are right, next thing you know we have cables on a spectrum.
&gt; Programmers usually brag saying that, they are changing the world through their work. have been programming for 20+ years , on and off, and have never heard anyone say that. (to be fair, a very few who may make that claim could be right) 
This is beyond dumb, it serves no purpose and is an added annoyance. Seriously nobody is having a fit about this, I have never heard about a 20 year old debate around this. 
i deserve the profits from my outrage factory because i put up the initial outrage capital and took the initial outrage risk
There's a difference between "advocating for a terminological change" and "whining" and I don't see how they did the latter as opposed to the former.
&gt; Swastika only has one connotation No, it doesn't. It actually has a rich history and meaning, of which its entirety has been soiled in the Western sphere because of a certain group of genocidal authoritarians. If we were to use your example involving a swastika, using its original meaning in a public project would understandably invite head turns, questions and objections. At first I was on the fence about master/slave terminology, but the swastika analogy has made things clearer for me. I understand why master and slave are being met with objections, now.
&gt; I am talking about it becoming unsettling only when you moved to the US. I chalk that up to a section of the US populace who are unbelievably stupid and puerile. 
Warden / Prisoner would have been a good political statement 
LOL at this article having the BDSM tag.
It's a community driven software project. Changing two words is the most minuscule of things to be worried about and certainly isn't a reason to channel Chicken Little in your posts.
You also have academia, the media, and international finance on your side. You're just a pawn of wealthy elites.
&gt; There's a difference between "advocating for a terminological change" and "whining" No there's not a difference, the sole purpose of your power trip is to show off that you can get publicly funded institutions to cater to your whims.
Thanks so much, I've thought of using the fuzz statements to randomize the picks' prospect grades. This allows me to put those grades into the probabilities I made to still stick with my system. I think if I wasn't so clung onto my own work your system would be all that's necessary to generate custom player overalls. It works great and I'll definitely be using it in the future. I think there is a way I could get it exactly to how I like it but I'd need a much better understanding of the system as a whole and for what I wanna do right now I just don't have the time for it. It's awesome to see what you can do with a few lines of code.
&gt; Pimp and Ho Well, now I know my new terminology. 
You can't expect to transliterate your C++ into Python. C++ is *compiled* into machine code, whereas Python is interpreted, and thus runs slower anyway. But it shouldn't run *that* much slower. We have ways of doing things in Python that play to the strengths of Python rather than its weaknesses - this is called "*Pythonic*". As u/bolapara says, below there are more efficient ways of doing what you need to do. Iterating through a string character-by-character to find numbers is one of those things that Python has better ways of doing. First, you can get a list of non-whitespace runs of characters in a string with the *.split()* method: a_string = "123 45 678 9012 3456 78" nums = a_string.split() The `nums` list will now contain: ["123","45","678","9012","3456","78"] You can also apply a function to every element of a list with the *map* function: ints = map(int,nums) The `ints` list will now contain: [123,45,678,9012,3456,78] If you re-write your program to do it this way - without any loops at all, unless you might have more than one line in your liczby.txt file - it should run *much* faster. I would, however, recommend you use the `with` statement to open your file: with open("liczby.txt", "r") as numbers: Which kind-of looks like a loop, but isn't. Hope that helps.
No one whined, they went out and *wrote code* and submitted a pull request. They tried to effect change by building something, which is the furthest thing from ineffectual whining.
&gt; It indicates our community still has a long way to go in terms of equality, as well as in respecting other cultures and the struggles they go through. Please explain how software design pattern nomenclature is the driving force in promoting equality and cultural appreciation. 
Could you please expand on how commits made by a French developer and approved by a Dutch developer about not using offensive language is americentric? 
Agreed. My major complaint is that people are blindly replacing master/slave with parent/child which doesn't exactly solve the issue in that it removes some of the semantics behind the original terminology. 
[The swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) is a 15,000 year old symbol, for the *vast* majority of its existence it had specific uses and was never a reference to Nazism. Yet, if someone chose to use the symbol in a community driven project, I'd understand if someone objected to it. 
**Swastika** The swastika (as a character 卐 or 卍) is a geometrical figure and an ancient religious icon from the cultures of Eurasia, where it has been and remains a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions and East Asian religions. In the Western world it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck until the 1930s, when it became a feature of Nazi symbolism as an emblem of Aryan race identity and, as a result, was stigmatized by association with ideas of racism and antisemitism.The name swastika comes from Sanskrit (Devanagari: स्वस्तिक, pronounced: swastik) and denotes "conducive to well being or auspicious". In Hinduism, the clockwise symbol is called swastika, symbolizing surya (sun), prosperity and good luck, while the counterclockwise symbol is called sauvastika, symbolizing night or tantric aspects of Kali. In Jainism, a swastika is the symbol for Suparshvanatha — the 7th of 24 Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers and saviours), while in Buddhism it symbolizes the auspicious footprints of the Buddha. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
PROCESS GENOCIDE!!!!
 &gt;monopoly in SV A region can’t monopolize anything. It would be like saying the coal mines in the south of America have a monopoly on the coal mining industry because it’s a good place to mine coal. Hiring engineers in silicon valley happen for a reason. There’s a ton of money there with a long established network of investing in technology. How is that a monopoly? Would you also say that Hollywood has a monopoly on the entertainment industry? Wall Street? Even though the removal of “slave” can very easily be taken as negative or petty it’s an effective and innocuous (in as much as the refactoring required with any such change) way to not be offensive to some amount of people. So I’m definitely on board with that. As well as education, which is also slowly changing. I can’t really get behind or really understand the basis for the monopoly comment though. If it were one large conglomerate controlling the industry that would make more sense. Investment groups and investors are free to invest as they see fit. Companies as well should be free to operate where they please while complying with laws. If anything other regions should incentivize such growth if that’s what they want. Or there could be encouragement for companies to operate in other places. I’m also not claiming to be an all-knowing expert of all the ins and outs of how business works in SV either. I do know that there’s problems specifically with diversity. But that’s not going to change with location. Diversity and inclusiveness in technology unfortunately isn’t isolated to one very small region of the world. 
&gt;Completely disagree. You're forcing everyone to change an innocuous naming convention on the off chance that an extreme few feel "ever so slightly hurt" about it. If anything, I would say you're hurting the "healing" by forcing this change through. I guess I'm confused about what's actually being changed. Nothing I've read has really been clear on whether they're disabling master/slave language in the actual code or whether they're just changing documentation and implementing a new best practice.
LGPL lets you make closed source apps with the library. There are a few special rules about being able to swap in modified libraries, but it is pretty straightforward. PyQt5 is made by a different company. They do not use the LGPL license. Therefore, you can use it for GPL-compatible open source projects only, unless you buy a commercial license.
hahahahhahaha
Sometimes it can imply a Primary/Secondary arrangement (both active, but one has more control where both are active, but have pretty discretely different roles). So although they might not "true" Master/Slave relationships, that is still how they are labeled. 
&gt; The context here matters. If the original key words for python were meant to glorify slavery, then the terms should be changed. If the original terms were chosen in order to reflect a technological relationship between systems, then it should be understood in context. &gt; &gt; Nailed it head on. There's really nothing else to debate on the subject. 
They can't, because they'd rather whine on Reddit instead of *building something* like the French developer who submitted pull requests with changes he'd like to see.
&gt;Nothing I've read has really been clear on whether they're disabling master/slave language in the actual code or whether they're just changing documentation and implementing a new best practice. A mix of all. At a high level, all "master" gets changed to "parent" and "slave" gets changed to "helper" or "worker". This ripples down into all code and documentation, and becomes the "best practice" for Python developers moving forward. Other programming languages / frameworks have decided on different terminology, so now you also have an increased fracturing of commonality. 
Did it though? I think OP's point is that diversity isn't best achieved by avoiding problems and focusing on appearances -- diversity is best achieved by creating awareness of the systematic differences in education that are pervasive in American public schools. In regards to the computer industry, this means fostering STEM programs in elementary schools, focusing on reading skills, and allowing successful students to accelerate their studies. It also means focusing on computer literacy at an early age, which I honestly think certain companies in Silicon Valley are trying to prevent. *glares at apple and their "what's a computer" commercial*
Its controversial because there are a growing number of people in the world that look around, trying to be offended at something. They look at programming, see the word slave and immediately "Oh! It says "slave", I must be offended and get it changed so the world can be a better place!" That's their entire thought process on the matter. 
&gt; hundreds of years of bad connotation. Ah yes, if it weren't for those pesky White Europeans, the blight of slavery would have never infected humanity **/s**
Encouraging hiring of minorities and emphasizing computer education are both important and can both be done at the same time. OP reaaaaaly just sounds like he doesn’t want to hire minorities.
Old disk drives have a master/slave relationship, so this terminology in computing predates the entire python programming language.
Call your message bus the Bottom Bitch to round out the nomenclature.
People seem to have no other problems.
When you put it that way, it seems like two residents of countries deeply embedded in white supremacy as well as the slave trade are trying to bury their collective guilt in the formation and profiting from human slavery. That makes that pull request rather disgusting once its origins are examined, thank you.
Changing some words does nothing for equality. The actions themselves, that the words are symbolic for, are what are reprehensible. This act really doesn't do much of anything, except promote the idea that political correctness, or this case in particular, is somehow a condemnation of an act that has nothing to do with programming.
&gt; I disagree. That correlation is manufactured by people that want to be upset about it. That is why I called it outrage culture. You're aware that the outrage is right here in your post, right? The person who submitted a request for changes in terminology, *went and wrote the code* for those changes. They *built the changes they wanted to see* and submitted patches. 
Wow, how retarded that is. 1. The Problem is not the word "ugly". The Problem is people seeing themselves as ugly or being called by others so. I have some more about this on my Mind, but I can't even comprehend the "reasoning" behind this, so it would be jsut a waste of precious words. 2. How is his suggestion to replace it with "Clean is better than dirty" any better? This would discriminate against all people, who like dirty Sex for example. If you start such a discussion in a technical world, there will never be an end to this. You'd have to get rid of the term "class" for example. It can be seen as a term for social status and thus hurt people, who are seen to be in a "low class" or whatever. There is no end to this. And what's the point? Does changing those words in Python make anyone, that was or is affected by slavery feel better or be able to lead a better life?
No, the changes that were submitted were only towards internal terminology. It amounted to a CTRL-F for "master" or "slave" and changing the words in Python's internals. You can write master, slave or the most offensive thing you can think of in Python and not get an error message.
No one was bothered by these terms. No one IS bothered by these terms. It’s all PC bullshit. NO ONE CARES ABOUT THIS CRAP. This is more virtue-signaling by the “concern police.” News flash: the universe doesn’t give a shit about your feelings. If you’re bothered by “mean” words, maybe programming isn’t for you. If you seriously believe that people were “hurt” or “oppressed” by these terms, you have no business interacting with technology. In fact, this is WHY many people choose to spend their lives in technical fields — because they just like to solve problems and make things work without having to deal with the falsity, posturing, and STUPIDITY of their fellow human beings. And now political correctness is ruining that too. Fuck off, world. 
&gt; I think OP's point is that diversity isn't best achieved by avoiding problems and focusing on appearances That's a false dichotomy fallacy. What do we need to do to promote diversity? It's not one thing. There are many things we can do and one of those things is not promoting language that is culturally insensitive.

Why is it bad to refer it? Should we modify all history books and refer to "slaves" as "THE PROHIBITED WORD" too just in case someone reads the word slave and gets offended? Every argument that I've read is just stupid. People wanting to be the angel guards of the single 1 person of the world that can be offended by a word. The problem is not the usage of the word, the problem is people getting offended by anything while others glorify them.
Reminder: the original patch submitter *effected the change he wanted to see* by writing code and building something. He worked in earnest and wasn't whining ineffectually, he was *building* and contributing to the Python project with his own code. Yet, here on Reddit, those earnest efforts are met with whining, snark and posts made in bad faith, like the above.
Just got back from lunch. If you're ever in San Francisco give this Halal cart on Market Street a try - it's really fucking good. &gt; I disagree. That correlation is manufactured by people that want to be upset about it. That is why I called it outrage culture. So the word Slave has always meant someone who was owned by another person dating back to like the 9th century. But that's not what you're worried about. You're worried that the people who say that they feel bad when these terms are used are being dishonest in order to gain (power?/sympathy?) There are other issues with your other points but I'm gonna cut this short in the interest of time. The fundamental problem is that when someone says, 'This thing hurts me', you say, 'No it doesn't you're faking it'. There is literally nothing in the world I can say that will get you to accept that their feelings are real and they matter. This is the focus of our two positions: I believe that their feelings are real and they matter - while you do not. Anything else we talk about is inevitably just going to lead back to this axiom. If you ever decide to trust that people's pain isn't 'manufactured outrage' then please please please revisit this issue in your head and see how you feel. Also if you're ever in San Francisco seriously try the Halal cart on Market and Front get the Combo Bowl over rice and add the extra hot sauce I promise you won't regret it. 
IDE drive bus is the first one that comes to mind. 
the same people who think Pepe the frog is evil, racist and every bad thing.
Well, yeah. I was just looking at the merits of the change itself rather than the reasoning behind it. The reason given in the PR is silly. 
Would you say you're *outraged*?
Meh, technically the majority of of the civilized world is Wage Slave. You don't have choice but to work if you want to live a comfortable life. Most people are only a paycheck or two away from finacial ruin, the middle class might hold out a few months but will end up the same without a wage/salary income. The 1% don't have this, they are the Masters.
Not saying you're wrong, but source?
Guido was instrumental in these changes and if you're so driven by ideology that you'd forgo technology over another option without weighing the merit of each, you're shooting yourself in the foot.
What do you perceive that taken from you?
As some who believe in equality i don't think it's fair to use the word superior. 
"technical irrelevant change" ?? Master/slave terms were used for many many years and everyone knows what it is. Lots of hardware and software documentation and code uses those terms and will continue to do forever. Changing how you name things brings confusion. Your comment is offensive by assuming we are irrespectful with other cultures just because we dont agree on renaming a word we've always used AND disagree on the idea that it is offensive. You are directly flagging us as the people you dont like, which is an insult.
Victor Stinner is the worst, but I guess we have to keep him for diversity reasons.
I don't think there's a racial etymology to that example. White/black or light/dark is often used to represent some kind of duality or opposite. "It's a gray area, it's not black and white" is an example of this, if the meaning of the metaphors had some kind of racial symbolism behind them, wouldn't that be reflected? I always associated these kinds of phrases along with classical notions of good and evil. White being associated with good, fulfillment, light, birth, caregiving, and purity while black is associated with evil, shadows/the dark, emptiness, death, corruption, negative emotion, chaos, and the abyss. I suppose the "gray" bit compels me most, as I'd expect the metaphor of black/white to be continued with some weird racial term were that the case. Perhaps I'm being naive though, if anyone has a counter argument I'm happy to listen.
I think... Define 3 points, a, b, c where c follows b follows a in your list. Make line AB, AC. Take the cross product of these lines. Then just define either a positive or negative cross product as clockwise.

The terms were used in Unix for process management, so at least that far back. They're still deeply embedded in both Unix and Linux.
I thought PyQT recently changed its licensing framework such that you can use it under the LGPL or equivalent. 
This is as dumb as a bunch of white people, calling white people, white.
This thread is filled with people melting down over this change and claiming "SJWs" or "PC culture" is ruining everything. My question to you is why do you give shit about this? Why are you so mad about something so innocuous? Does it impact your coding in some way? This is a totally arbitrary change, accept it and move on with your weird nerd ass life.

You're going to move from a dynamically typed interpreted language to a statically typed compiled language with fairly different use cases because of some shit that has no bearing on coding itself? Cool, sounds very smart.

slaves, probably
No problem. I'm glad it helped. Note that there are other ways to do these things too, but they require slightly deeper knowledge. This way keeps it simple and understandable.
The original patch submitter was virtue signalling literally fixing a non problem, likely introducing maintenance problems. Now I have to slave over a response to your comment, a comment meant to shame other people, as if you were the master of public opinion here.
&gt; I think frustrated would be a better word.

"Student Atholetes"
People get their panties in a bunch over the dumbest shit. My problem with this is they changed it to terms I think could be confusing or don't fit. They should have just changed "slave" to "pawn" if anything. 
&gt; Does it impact your coding in some way? Yes, coding and documentation. It also changes established terminology, meaning all education going forward needs to be updated and changed. It also creates more of a fracture in terminology between different programming languages, as now everyone is adopting different terms for the same damn thing. 
Neat
Hey Nick, what are you doing man, I thought we are friends now!!
&gt; Guido von Rossum approved of the changes, do you think he'd just approve of changes that would introduce maintenance problems? Oh, well thanks, since Guido lives in Belmont CA and works for Dropbox, I guess that's the americentrism that this subthread was unable to find. And are you honestly telling me, esp after the last Guido fiasco that resulted in him stepping down as bdfl that guido doesn't okay code that can result in maintenance and other huge problems?
Who gives a shit? It's a programming language. My only complaint is that "worker" and "helper" take more effort to pronounce than "slave" and "master".
&gt; No reason to be ridiculous, just because other people hold convictions and can competently code changes in line with those convictions doesn't mean you need to engage in hyperbole. &gt; No reason to be ridiculous, just because other people hold convictions and can competently code changes in line with those convictions doesn't mean you need to engage in hyperbole. you first. My conviction is no more ridic than the patch originators.
You want to implement that
I'm not saying their feeling aren't real. I'm saying there's a problem when they inject feelings into an established, innocuous terminology that is inherently *absent* of feeling. I tihnk the comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9ftev3/masterslave_terminology_was_removed_from_python/e5zg1uy/) is relevant. 
Database master/slave implementations differ depending on what backend you use. Some of them are "true", some of them act more as Primary/Secondary. That's one example. 
search for the "Shoelace Formula"
But everybody IS hiring minorities. I dare You to find an American or Western European IT or engineering company with 10+ employees that doesn't have at least one Asian on the team (East Asian, Indian, Pakistani, Iranian or Arab, doesn't matter). Companies hire people who do a good job and make money for them, meritocracy is ingrained in capitalism. Since STEM fields are popular and respected in most of Asia, there are quite a few of Asian STEM graduates and hence employees. They are even universally over-represented in these fields in the West. There should be absolutely no encouragement for hiring any kind of minority. Discrimination against any kind of minority should be harshly punished, but no 'positive' measures should be made. Why? Because any kind of 'positive' discrimination is - discrimination. You're, by definition, taking a spot (position in a company, scholarship, whatever) from someone more qualified and giving it to someone less qualified, just because of their identity. There are few worse and more unjust things you can do. If (s)he was qualified, (s)he would have gotten the spot without discriminating other candidates, with no regard to their identity. This results in numerous negative consequences. Since racial issues are most inflammatory, I'm using them as an example. If you stimulate hiring, say, blacks - you do it at the expense of everybody else. So, someone doing business with your company is (absolutely rationally) going to avoid your black employees, because the standards for their hiring were lower. Now, every black employee who was actually hired justly is discriminated against by your customers because of those 'positive' measures and their work is devalued. All because YOU are giving justification to racism. Giving something (say, computer education) to poor black people, but not poor white and Asian people also fuels racism and gives it justification in the eyes of the discriminated group. It does absolutely nothing to stimulate equality. What You should do is provide free education to all interested people. If that's not possible, then all poor people. That and fighting discrimination by punishing it is enough to help a discriminated minority achieve equality in a long but reasonable period (couple of generations). Introducing even more ('positive') discrimination will prevent them from ever achieving equality.
This may be more a /r/learnpython thing, but: On your computer, all files are just 0s and 1s. To turn that into something meaningful, there are encodings like ASCII and UTF-8 that translate a bunch of 0s and 1s to a readable character. Pictures aren't text, but they are 0s and 1s, so technically you can use UTF-8 to turn them into (meaningless) characters. Assuming you opened it in a text editor, that's likely what happened.
Are you implying odd numbers are indivisible? b/c 9, 15, 21, 25, ... might like to have a word with you. 
They were responding to several private complaints, presumably from Americans because slavery and its consequences are not as prevalent in public consciousness in countries outside America. The tension of race-relations (specifically in relation to former slaves i.e. Africans) is a distinctly American phenomenon. Plus, not sure about the developer, but Van Rossum has lived in the US for over 20 years and his kid is an American citizen. Saying he's Dutch is misleading because he's very much in tune with American culture. 
They might well but I'm afraid I'm not on speaking terms with multiples of 3.
Blah blah blah blah I don’t want to hire black people.
I say "cow", you think "large animal on four legs that chews all day". But if I say "you stupid cow", you think "aw gee, the internet is cursing at me again". And that's why context matters. If I read "master" in a technical documentation, I don't associate ownership of humans, I associate some technical entity that controls another technical entity or something like that. That's the bottom of this issue. Some people think that words should always mean the worst possible thing. The problem with this approach is that *every* word can mean the worst possible thing. If I say "I'm gonna show you something *real* nice" and then start running towards you swinging a tire iron, you're won't think "what a nice guy. I can't wait for that nice thing!"
spamming youtube video u/Nicksil take action my friend, we don't need spammers here :D
I think these offensive words should also be removed from the Bible. 
It's also very possible that OP simply doesn't have any minority applicants and is venting about that. The Comp Sci field isn't exactly swimming with blacks, Latinos, or women. At the firm I interned at least summer, about 95% of applicants were white or Asian, and out of the 14 women that applied, 12 of them were Chinese and couldn't pass the interview stage for lack of English skills.
Holy shit, this is at least 3rd thread about this same topic and it's again full of comments about "virtue signaling" and "cultural marxism". Time to leave this subreddit, I guess.
You don’t think the context of a master telling a slave what to do might be the context that is getting changed?
Rather than being flippant, please point out the lines in the thread that suggest that anyone has a problem with black people.
Everything should be changed to Aladdeen/Aladeen. 
It's not so bad if you just started to programming. It might be good to improve your algorithm skill in order to be a better developer/programmer. You should check this: [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Try to solve the problems with python. 
No, slippery slope is a leads to b leads to c without causal links.
&gt;Imagine if slave owners began to call their slaves workers and helpers. The new terms lessen the ugliness of slavery and diverts attention away from its violence. This is a complete red herring. What does this have to do with the argument for taking slavery-related language out of Python? It’s a completely different context. &gt;But I think the real solution is first improving America’s education system across the board in all communities. Then breaking the monopoly that Silicon Valley companies have and allowing different communities in America to be more competitive. &gt;Begging or shaming companies into hiring people of color doesn’t actually change pre-existing structures within companies. lmao so we have to completely fix our education system before attempting to hire a more diverse workforce? This is like the argument that we can’t pass immigration reform until the border is “secure.” The border will never be 100% secured just like the education system will never be perfect, and even if it will be, why wait to apply more equitable practices across the board? Blaming the education system removes all responsibility from the companies hiring people and ignores the real biases and barriers for hiring people from underrepresented backgrounds that are already as or more qualified than their competitors. The issue here is that people who aren’t black (including me) can’t fully understand to have language of slavery be used in any context in a society where the impact of American slavery is still keenly felt. But we have to try. 
Honestly, I would have preferred Parent/Child, because that's generally the go-to terminology. The only problem I have with master/slave is how nonstandard it is. IIRC hard drives were the only place that the subject really comes up; in fact I didn't even know Python used the terms until now. "helper and worker" are also nonstandard and silly, but regardless, I fully welcome a departure from master/slave because they became nonstandard and outdated almost a decade ago. 
ITT: people who are part of the problem. Just because it accurately describes what’s happening in the code doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to accommodate people from underrepresented backgrounds and prevent them from having to be reminded of the system that enslaved their ancestors 150 years ago. Slavery’s fingerprints are still all over our society. And what the hell is the harm in the change? It’s hard enough being black in tech, removing this kinda of pernicious language at the cost of having to rename some concepts/variables is a small price to pay to make a step in the right direction. This is largely from an American/Silicon Valley perspective but the point stands.
Odoo itself is very impressive. But what exactly is going on here? It's a video of somebody clicking through a webui?!?
We'll have to use Wingdings then. Oh wait, that'll discriminate against the visually impaired
&gt; Why is it bad to refer it? Should we modify all history books and refer to "slaves" as "THE PROHIBITED WORD" too just in case someone reads the word slave and gets offended? Of course not. That’s a historical context where the point is to remember what happened in the past so we can learn from it. But that doesn’t mean people should be reminded of slavery in contexts that have nothing to do with history. 
Not existing culture. The term blacklist goes back to the 16th century. It's a linguistic inheritance far older than the current culture.

Find-and-replace is a change in code. If I refactor a module by renaming something, I am changing code. The person who made those code changes did a lot more than you did with your posts on Reddit. If you have a problem with their work, I suggest you spend the time and create your own set of patches and them submit them for inclusion.

Just because something can be a fallacy doesn't mean it's always a fallacy. Even when something is a fallacy, that doesn't mean it's wrong.
They're not mutually exclusive...
The original meaning of most words are different from their current though. Define master gives "a man who has people working for him, especially servants or slaves." Along with several other meanings. 
I'm Indian. I'd like to see someone object to its use (in the Indian form, not in the Nazi form, and yes, those two are different representations), if only so I can educate them.
What? That's one definition out of many. Google even specifies that that is the *historical* definition. As in, not commonly used now. All other definitions are neutral or even positive.
&gt;The person who made those code changes did a lot more than you did with your posts on Reddit. Why in the world would I submit a change request for something I don't want? On top of that, how does their putting work towards something I don't want somehow give them more credibility and applause just from "doing stuff" rather than the effectiveness and quality of what they do?! &gt;If you have a problem with their work, I suggest you spend some time to create your own set of patches, Oh ok, a patch to remove patches? Good idea. Except this isn't a Monty Python skit, you can't sack the sackers. And now that it is an accepted change request it would be a lot harder to change again. &gt;If I refactor a module by renaming something, I am changing code. You're changing your representation of the level of effort based on how you're spinning things. In one comment, it's "just a find and replace" while in another you're lauding the guy for "creating his own set of patches".

Okay, so if I take the first three points and find the cross product between them. Bear in mind I don’t know the shape of the polygon (it’s generated automatically). If the product is negative, why does that imply it’s counter clockwise or clockwise? 
Belittling the concerns raised is not a valid counter argument. 
didn't realize there was so much faggotry within the python community 
I had a look, I assume that you can say if the area is negative then the coordinates are counterclockwise right?
&gt; The Comp Sci field isn't exactly swimming with blacks, Latinos, or women. It's not, but it also kinda depends on where you are. There are quite a few Latinos in southern California that are in CS. &gt; ... or women. I wonder why. Many organizations in CS (e.g., the PSF) go out of it's way to encourage diversity. PyLadies in-part exists because of the PSF. Guido gave a keynote years ago where he only took questions from women. Given that, the result of this master/slave debate should be obvious to everyone given the history of the PSF and diversity. The solution is not to say it's OK to use certain languages when there are no blacks or women around. We can all be better.

yes, and this change doesn't lead to other changes because there's no causal links established

oh of course, thanks for pointing that one out!

&gt; But if I say "you stupid cow", you think "aw gee, the internet is cursing at me again". Finish the thought: "aw, gee, the internet is comparing my weight to that of a cow's". The insult was born from and continues to be used *because* of its context meaning "heavy weight" (even if used on a skinny person). By the same token, master/slave really only makes sense *because* of its human ownership meaning. We don't call non-Queen bees and ants "slaves", we call them "workers".
I'm not offended by it. I hate the horrible precedent this change sets, and am vocal about it.
What a sloppy article. &gt;Given that slavery was institutionalized in the United States for hundreds of years... Rubbish. Institutionalised slavery existed in some US states for approx. 80 years. That makes it no less worse for the individuals concerned but it speaks to a certain hyperbole-inducing ignorance on the part of the writer. 
&gt; replace class You could call it a prototype... &lt;ducks&gt;
My two cents here is that this is fucking retarded and I'm sorry I can't say it politely
Like a penis!
Different horses for different courses. For example, in my industry (telecommunications) which uses alot of voip, most of the applications for communication are written in C or C++ (some palaces use javsla, though the gc makes it tricky). The apps have to handle alot of packets and typically the packets are retransmitted if there is no response in 300-500ms. Which means if you are slow there's even more load to handle. However we would use something like python to parse logs of those apps or for parsing and reporting on call data etc.
\*Right back at you:\* My question to you is why do you give shit about this? Why are you so mad about something as innocuous as the word "slave"? Does it impact your coding in some way? This is a totally uncontroversial word, accept it and move on with your weird SJW ass life. 
I think someone else mentioned in the thread about this the other day that this change introduces some ambiguity in some parts of the documentation, because we now have parent/worker to describe the former master/slave, as well as parent/child to describe os.fork, so parent is being used to describe half of two different relationships. 
&gt;One developer even invoked BDSM culture, saying “‘master/slave’ can have *positive* connotations. "You want to support diversity, then why are you discriminating against that subculture?" Man, you know you're in trouble when you upset the BDSM folks. But that developer said it best: &gt;Talking about diversity: my wife is of a nationality that historically were often stolen to be slaves and indentured servants, and were discriminated against as second-class people right well into the second half the middle of the 20th century. My maternal family comes from a racial group (Slavic) which gives us the English word for slave and come from serf background. Both of us are angered by this attack on our linguistic culture. Stop trying to sanitize and infantalize language. That's far more offensive than the master/slave terminology. Infantalize, indeed
The more you give in to this shit the more people will continue to look for things to be offended about. When people know their sad 'hobby' actually 'helps' they'll continue to pester and plague people until their ultimate goal is achieved and anyone with common sense in their way is perceived to be a symptom of their fantasy scenario. If I sat down and said the word python offends me would anyone take me seriously? Can we talk about getting python removed? That word is exactly as politically charged as every other term/keyword in python. Where do you draw the line?
The slope sure is slippery

[Here's an interesting paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236752849_Broken_Metaphor_The_Master-Slave_Analogy_in_Technical_Literature) I found that delves into its history in the mechanical, electrical, and computing worlds.
The way you worded it, it made you seem as if you thought the change was good because you pointed out "a man who has people working for him, especially servants or slaves" as the primary definition.
My reasoning is hinges on the smallest polygon you could make is a triangle. So if you draw a triangle on paper, you can cross 2 sides and determine if you drew it cw or ccw... Depending on if you assign a positive cross to be cw or ccw (and which sides you crossed)

&gt; The context being that code doesn’t glorify actual real life slavery or the historical practice. And that code doesn’t possess the same human rights or dignity as human beings. Not yet...
If you're trying to get away from SJW politics the last thing you want is something associated with Google. Just fork the python codebase or patch the binary with a regex.
I like whipped cream on crackers.
I laughed out loud at this. Imagine a programming language composed entirely of Wingdings.
uo is still &lt;3 
Don't feed the trolls my dude
SJW's now have one less thing to wring their soft hands about. 
Don't get me started on capitalistic. I'm still building out my class-less programming language called lenin. Everything is truthy. Equality comparison always results in true. There is never a master/slave/manager/worker relationship. All processes have an equal work load and are created equal, such that they all have equal priority. They do stand in long queues though to get resources.
Why are you talking about everyone? The context implies programmers. Also are you implying people perceive 'masters' degrees as a mark of slavery?! Ridiculous. Think twice before you comment.
you're seriously comparing people who have low paying jobs that they're unhappy in to people who've been sold into sex slavery in foreign countries?
Bluetooth tech uses this terminology. Pretty sure it predates python
the dutch were some of the worst slave masters in history
To quote another comment from a thread about redis: &gt; “Master/slave” isn’t even a good metaphor, unless I’m missing the historical example where slaves lived a life identical to their master’s with sub-second delays just in case one of them suddenly needed to step in and replace the master if he died...
newspeak
Sounds good man, feel free to DM me if you have any other questions and post an update when you finish.
Classic , “I’m white and I say so”. 
Move back to where you came racist 
&gt; But I think the real solution is first improving America’s education system across the board in all communities. \*shrug\* We can do both. But also, this is a relevant article: [The Myth of the ‘Pipeline Problem’](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-13/the-myth-of-the-pipeline-problem-jid07tth) [bloomberg.com]
Don’t you Indians still have a caste system? And you’re suppose to be our moral compass? Yeah, I trust your insight on things. 
The meltdown over this on here is quite frankly embarrassing.
Politically correct, culturally sensitive BS run amok.
As an American that seems even more sad. Something that makes intuitive sense is now being named something you don’t understand. Alavert is not ok but this is lazy OC at best and bad for python. 
Please don't cross post r/learnpython posts here. We have a hard enough time pointing folks toward that sub enough as it is.
I disagree master and slave is not used in other tech
Can we do hatchery/drone instead?
Uber naive. 
And it just creates confusion where there wasn't any before for basically no reason. Companies now have to choose whether to stick with the old terminology or switch to the new one, and it might take some time for everyone to adjust to the change.
I’m not about to about to get in this on /r/python of all places but when backlashes of slavery, social structures, and racism are still felt by a large portion of the population who the am I to tell them what they feel is false?
He’s right, you’re losing power and it hurts. 
Article was bs and biased. 1904, they were sending post cards with people hung by trees, I never trusted these WS, just read the comments. They reveal themselves. 
Grandfathered when referring to things like cellphone plans
"convicts"
Just don't call children without parents orphans! Had an IRL orphan flip shit over naming convention correctness from that one in some documentation. 
So we should force or shame businesses into increasing diversity, just for the purpose of improving their products?
My exact thoughts as I clicked into this post. Had a good laugh, thanks.
Parents and children enable orphans. That's no good.

Yes it does. Android is kinda shaky but it can be hacked together that it even works with pyjnus.
As much as I hate to agree with the people who use "SJW" as an insult, this change seems really silly to me. I can't wait for people to start talking about where the word "robot" comes from.
It isn't - the controversy is all driven by people complaining about "outrage culture" and "PC gone mad". The vast majority of people are not talking about this as a huge issue, or making a big deal out of it. They raise a valid point - these terms aren't great because they refer to something we all agree is wrong, and that can be hurtful to some people because it references history that may have affected them or people they love. If I'm writing code and I create something that kills processes, I'm not going to name it gas chamber, for example. Sure, it's just an analogy, no one is actually being killed, but clearly that's a name that makes people think of a very painful thing. Changing something to make it better for people using it isn't vital, no, but it's not a problem either. Everyone is making the point that the exact words really don't matter that much, and that is true - so why stick with words that can bring up painful stuff for some people?
&gt; This is a complete red herring. What does this have to do with the argument for taking slavery-related language out of Python? It’s a completely different context. I am stunned that you are using "It's a completely different context" to argue against that post, when the entire point of that post was "it's a completely different context." Failure to recognize that is why we have people submitting patches to change language that has nothing to do with slavery.
Doesn't your culture have racism? Mine does. That doesn't mean you're automatically racist, but you probably don't care so much if you're the more prominant race.
I think we can both agree that if a Jewish person harbored any negative feelings towards Egypt or felt uneasy around pyramids due to the biblical enslavement of their ancestors, we'd all be comfortable telling them that they're being unreasonable. I think we both can also agree that if someone lost a relative on 9/11 and now feels uncomfortable flying, that they're experiencing a reasonable anxiety. So we now have an example of both reasonable and unreasonable anxieties. I think 150 years is more than enough time to move it over to the side with the biblical Egyptians.
I’ve been in tech for 24 years and the term was long established when I learned it. (Hard drives used to almost exclusively work in a master/slave context at a BIOS and jumper level.) If I had to guess, I’d say it goes back to at least the early 1980s or 1970s, possibly further.
cant tell, are 6ou talking about altrighters overacting to diversity activities or 12 year olds on tumblrs being dragon kins.
Was this real? I thought this was a joke!

It's all symbolism to show that this terminology doesn't belong in software engineering. Look...if I say the word elephant, you see an elephant. If I say clown, you see a clown. If I (black) am talking to a coworker (white), guess what will happen if one of us says 'slave' while discussing something software related? You can't control subconscious thoughts so why not just remove the opportunity for them to arise, i.e removing this terminology? But hey, maybe I'm wrong and slavery will get abolished worldwide next week....unfortunately though if it were up to you guys, 50 years from now my grandchildren would still have to learn about masters &amp; slaves at their local uni's software engineering 101 class...you guys stood strong and didn't let outrage culture win, congrats! /s
I could agree with you about 150 being too much if there were no other negative effects of slavery. Black people continued to be marginalized and not treated as equals past the civil rights movement, which was very recent. The civil rights movement was not the same as slavery obviously however I feel the lack of education, proper healthcare, generational wealth, etc. are still felt in today’s community inpart to slavery.
They did not build anything. They renamed something. Huge difference. Not that I really expect a rabid fanatic like you to understand it though.
Someone should put in a PEP asking Guido to change his name because it could be offensive to some Italians.
Your fallacy is slippery slope! 
I'm not arguing the change would lead to other changes. I'm arguing that if this reasoning is justified, there are many other terms in python to which the same reasoning applies. 
Because I'm not arguing that the change leads to changes. I'm arguing the precedent can be cited in *similar* cases, of which there are many in Python. 
You're not helping. 
You ever just feel like you're in a box with the walls closing in on you? Things like this make me feel that way. The box has gotten a lot smaller over the past few years and it is becoming hard to breathe in here.
&gt; Why in the world would I submit a change request for something I don't want? That's a really weird thing to ask, considering no one suggested you make a change you do want. A coherent reading of the suggestion *was to make the changes you do want*, by perhaps, reverting the code back to master/slave terminology. &gt; On top of that, how does their putting work towards something I don't want somehow give them more credibility and applause just from "doing stuff" rather than the effectiveness and quality of what they do?! You're participating in the very same outrage culture by whining on the internet instead of doing something constructive about it. &gt; Oh ok, a patch to remove patches? Good idea. Except this isn't a Monty Python skit, you can't sack the sackers. You're right, it isn't this isn't the Monty Python skit you're treating it as. Back here in the real world, reversions happen all the time. &gt; In one comment, it's "just a find and replace" while in another you're lauding the guy for "creating his own set of patches". If you need to rely on pedantry to make an argument, it isn't very good one. By *creating* a patch with the find and replace, submitting it, interacting with the community and revising their changes, they did something that effected real change in the Python project. You, on the other hand, post on the internet about how you're seeing persecution in these patches because you're "forced" to use a naming convention on a project you don't contribute to and refuse to even try to contribute to, lol. &gt; You're forcing everyone to change an innocuous naming convention on the off chance that an extreme few feel "ever so slightly hurt" about it. 
I would like to suggest facilitator and associate. 
Don't be facetious. I obviously meant that posters would rather whine instead of *making constructive contributions to the project*. Which is true, I've yet to see anyone here propose changes, a fork or anything besides posting about it online. At least the French contributor who is being accused of whining *did something about it*. &gt; Do you know the process of actually contributing something other than a bugfix to python? No, because my experience with contributing to Python was relatively much better than with other projects. &gt; Or even then, how cumbersome the process is? Whining about it is much easier than doing anything about it, I agree. &gt; The level of stupidity in this comment is absurd. The level of irony in this comment is absurd.
&gt; Master/Slave describes exactly how that relationship works -- the master is in control and dictates what the slave does. gonna preface this by saying I would not have made the change, but is this always the relationship? I could be wrong and I'm not being specific to python but I don't think the master is always idle while the slave is carrying out duties. In some instances a slave takes over when a master fails - that's not how a master/slave relationship works. in some instances i think supervisor and worker or superior/subordinate would be more accurate descriptions
That's cool, but in this case this "ineffectual whining" effected real changes in the Python codebase.
You could rename all of the variables in Python's source to different types of fruit and it wouldn't affect me at the end of the day, because I choose Python based on its merits. Someone who skips over a potential solution because of this change is shooting themselves in the foot.
Yeah, the terminology has been around a long time. [Link for those interested.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/master-slave-flip-flop/)
&gt;Why are you talking about everyone? The context implies programmers. It may surprise you to learn that some programmers are African American too. What's your point? &gt;Also are you implying people perceive 'masters' degrees as a mark of slavery?! Ridiculous. Think twice before you comment. If there was a "slave" degree you would have a point. This is the most idiotic "gotcha" and it doesn't even work. 
Guido spoke out against the fascist SJWs who wanted to rename the master/slave architecture.
&gt;So we should force or shame businesses into increasing diversity, just for the purpose of improving their products? No. We should encourage businesses to identify and remove prejudice inside their organization. Lack of diversity is just a really common symptom.
You'd have to pay me to give a shit one way or another on the issue. 
Because wikipedia is not a real thing. I tell all my students and employees that if they ever cite that bullshit as a source, they're either fired or failed. 
&gt; What do you perceive was taken from you? my dignity.
It seems you're purely ignorant and havent even looked at the issue properly. Some of the changes in reference to 'master' have no reference to slave. Like i said, think twice and think hard before you comment. It seems like either you have a vendetta against words themselves and not the context behind them or you're a troll.
So, we're going to do this thread once a day, every day, from now on? Why can't rightists just leave their identity politics and outrage culture behind when they code? Why do they have to drag their politics into everything, and force their preferred terminology into every project's documentation? Infiltrating and trying to force particular language is straight out of Communism, or Orwell! Is that the image the right wants to project? Why can't they just be civil and focus on the code for once in their lives? They're all just a bunch of over-triggered crybullying special snowflakes who probably aren't qualified to make real technical contributions anyway, maybe that's why they get so worked up about documentation.
It's basically how to call main without the compiler running it upon first read through 
This the one I was referring to: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9101#issuecomment-420508902
I've stated that my frustration is not in the change itself, but moreso the "reasoning" behind it. I did *not* say it was persecution, and it is not. I also did *not* say I do not, and certainly did not say I *refuse* to, contribute to Python. &gt;Back here in the real world, reversions happen all the time. Yeah ok bud. "Back here in the real world", no one is going to walk back an approved change request that Guido himself blessed and that was subsequently closed to all further discussion. &gt;they did something that effected real change in the Python project. They made a needless, unwarranted change that is in essence virtue signaling about "look how much we don't like slavery!!!". It does not solve a problem. It does not introduce new, or expand existing, functionality. It is *worthless* except to those who value the *appearance* of being virtuous. Like yourself, who continues to glorify change for the sake of change rather than for any semblance of actual progress. 
The irony is lost on your parent commenter.
&gt;Context is also what makes words anything at all. What? A sentence without context can still send an *apparently* clear message. But added context can entirely change the meaning of words.
Maybe he's got better reasons than virtue signaling. He does say people have requested the change. If you're doing something to cause disturbance to others, and it costs you nothing to adjust, why wouldn't you? If it makes python more popular with a wider audience, where's the harm?
&gt;is this always the relationship? Not entirely, it can be a sort of "catch-all" term sometimes for other configurations that have a primary (master) and secondary (slave[s]). &gt;don't think the master is always idle while the slave is carrying out duties. Not sure where you got that from, because I didn't say that was the case. "In control" does not mean "always idle". It also does not mean the Master doesn't have other responsibilities/functions. &gt;in some instances i think supervisor and worker or superior/subordinate would be more accurate descriptions. Agreed, other comments mention this as well. Some database engines tend to use master/slave terminology when something like your suggestions or "primary"/"secondary" would be more specific. 
I agree with a lot of this and appreciate the thought you've put into it, but wanted to pick up on something which you did not make your main premise: &amp;#x200B; &gt;Begging or shaming companies into hiring people of color doesn’t actually change pre-existing structures within companies. &amp;#x200B; It's true, but it makes them a lot better than when they are fully white. Nobody needs each company to employ from categories in proportion to the census... that would be awful. &amp;#x200B; Yet an all-white society has a very different racial dynamic and mindfullness than a mixed society, no matter the proportions. The all-white group can so easily step a wrong foot, given that their imperative to make profit exists within a socio-economic structure with more pressing concerns: active contemporary racism. &amp;#x200B; Anyone interviewing at the all-white corp, if not white, gets a clear signal about their prospects (fair or not, justly extrapolated) whereas the white interviewees does. A single person of colour changes this (effective) perception much more than the second or subsequent. &amp;#x200B; Likewise, having one single family-member who is a computer-programmer and not a \[the list of "black" jobs aren't very exciting\] can be a huge deal to the younger family-members and friends who might not have even imagined studying toward such a thing let alone interviewing for it... why would you, whilst all the programmers are white? &amp;#x200B; It is not perhaps, the companies with few non-white employees who would ever be asked to address thei homogeneity, but moreso those with none. It's an ugly fix to a very ugly problem. Other fixes are slower. For the reasons listed above, white industries and white companies have factors forcing them to stay that way without external interference. &amp;#x200B; Once people of colour are \*allowed\* into previously all-white societies... THEN diversity happens, but not without. The more you talk about diversity in the absence of those of whom you speak, the more you foreignise those people. There is no issue other than that some people are excluded and less-valued, systematically, judged on the colour of their skin. The cure is no more nuanced than: Let people through the door to do their job and pay them. &amp;#x200B; It's particularly pertinent to programming, as here is a place where there is no excuse for other than meritocracy. A black child can learn programming themselves and excel at it without any financial help or any dependence on the school-&gt;employer system, which they may justifiably (and often do) perceive as a white-man's racket.
This SJW agenda has to stop
&gt; They look at programming, see the word slave and immediately "Oh! It says "slave", I must be offended and get it changed so the world can be a better place!" The people you're describing are not interested in making world a better place. They are only interested in showing others how pious they are.
I've yet to see anything on any of Python's issue trackers. Again, my assertion is that if you have a problem with this change, make your case for a reversion and submit it. Otherwise, you're just whining on the internet.
“It’s alright. I am a police officer.” Pretty nice phrase, right? Typically, this phrase has harmless implications. However, now consider the person saying it just broke into your house and shot a member of your family. Context matters and it changes how you interpret language. The master/slave relationship is well known and understood. There are also contexts outside of humanity where that relationship exists. Therefore, the terms master and slave are useful in describing that relationship to other people.
This is it guys. First they change our master/slave terminology, then they add a bunch of wamen to the core team! What's next? Are they gonna make me use the toilet every time I need to poo?! SJWs and their Cultural Marxism have gone too far, I tells ya.
&gt; Yeah ok bud. "Back here in the real world", no one is going to walk back an approved change request that Guido himself blessed and that was subsequently closed to all further discussion. Back here in the real world the community has overridden Guido and he's stepped down from making. I'm sure if you put some effort into it, you could find like minded people who could find an avenue of effective change. But that's hard isn't it? It's much easier to complain in the comments section of some website than it is to do something to fix the thing you're complaining about. &gt; They made a needless, unwarranted change that is in essence virtue signaling about "look how much we don't like slavery!!!". What are your posts other than virtue signaling? &gt; Like yourself, who continues to glorify change for the sake of change rather than for any semblance of actual progress. Try again, I never once glorified or approved of this change. My issue is with a bunch of people on the internet who are all talk and no action, like yourself.
But he *effected change*!! Celebrate him! 
Helpers \*
In before someone claims that this submission's title is stifling their free speech.
If you ignore the politics of this and don't try making this a referendum on political correctness/SJW gone amok or cultural insensitivity, let's look at what the accepted pull requests actually changed: * [a couple](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9101/files) docstrings references where terms like `master process` was changed to `main process` or slave was changed to `worker` and where [`pliant slaves` was changed to `pliant childs` then to `pliant children` and then to `helpers` in documentation of `distutils` `install.finalize_options()`](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9102/files). No code/variable names/function names/object names were touched. * [Python's test/regrtest](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9099) for multiprocessed regression tests where `--slaveargs` was renamed `--worker-args` and `run_tests_slave()` to `run_tests_worker()`. You should note this is all within the test package, which [the python documentation warns](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html): &gt; The test package is meant for internal use by Python only. It is documented for the benefit of the core developers of Python. Any use of this package outside of Python's standard library is discouraged as the code mentioned here can change or be removed without notice between releases of Python. No python code anyone is ever supposed to use was changed. Only documentation and internal-python-regression test code (that you are warned to never use and may change without notice). While I think it's a ridiculous to waste any effort changing the terminology or mocking being offended, the level of counter backlash over what amounts to a mild rewording of documentation (of terms not actually used in the code) is additionally crazy.
It’s not just about context. It’s an entirely different argument. Arguing to change language to divert attention from *actual slavery* is a completely separate issue from changing language that *references* slavery needlessly. They’re not even close to the same thing. 
Not much difference when you will be forced out of your home if you don't pay your rent/mortgage/property tax. If you don't think the men with guns who show up to remove you when stop paying, won't get violent if you refuse to cooperate, just give it a try yourself and refuse to leave. We all live under the threat of violence in a sense. To differing agree for sure then the sex worker who beat by her pimp on the regular.
&gt; That doesn't really make any sense. I'm talking about running something like: `from pyti.slave.manager import Queue` where you're importing a library or something that specifically references master/slave in this context. Are the people working on/using pyti gonna have to update their language? I'm just trying to get a sense of how it affects the day-to-day.
 &gt;Back here in the real world the community has overridden Guido and he's stepped down from his role in making the project's decisions. Go look at the change request. *He specifically* closed it to further comment and stated his approval. If you think his word doesn't still carry the most weight when he weighs in on things then maybe you just don't pay attention. &gt;What are your posts other than virtue signaling? I'm not the one who created a change request for a contrived reason to demonstrate how "good" I am. &gt;Try again, I never once glorified or approved of this change. You applauded his "effecting real change" repeatedly. You also used the swastika as your "tipping point" to say you decided you were fine with the change. &gt;My issue is with a bunch of people on the internet who are all talk and no action, like yourself. Your issue is with people discussing submissions related to Python on a website *dedicated to discussion*. Try again. 
It's still an ad homenim fallacy to bring up the caste system as a reason for not believe him.
&gt;Are the people working on/using pyti gonna have to update their language? No, they're not being forced to. They probably won't change existing code until either they have a good spot to refactor everything or they are a higher-profile "entity" that wants to adhere strictly to the new coding standard. New code will almost assuredly use the new terminology. 
Hard drives, back in the days. Master and slave drive.
Thank!! I like you code!!
I think it's the way they've handled the situation that's pissed people. They came off seeming kind of self righteous. I think if they held it open to debate, and if it came from a good place, then most people would agree in the end.
I never thought I'd see a tech NIMBY.
lol
On the flipside, you understand in these pull requests we are talking about a handful of uses of the term master/slave being replaced with equivalent terms **IN DOCUMENTATION** when the actual code doesn't refer to master or slave.^(1) I agree people claiming offense over this is completely over-the-top, but I also think this is a complete overreaction to a minor editing of some documentation. Again, if you get asked to do a change in your user-facing library that will create headaches for users, yes resist strongly such trivial rewordings. But I frankly can't care about documentation word choice. &amp;nbsp;^1 Yes code in [Python's internal-use-only regression tests did change in one flag and one function, though they explicitly warn you not to use their test package for anything -- it's just for core developers and code may change between python releases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html)).
"Go" is an offensive word for handicapped people. Time to change that name, because I got nothing better to do. 
Install [anaconda](anaconda.org), it comes with a notebook called 'Jupyter' which is exactly what you are looking for. Jupyter allows you quickly execute your code in a local web session and see the changes that you've made. It is used by laboratories and engineers in all different fields. Anaconda includes conda (a package manager) which is easy to use, as well as many packages you might want later on like mathplotlib (for graphing/maths), pandas (for data analysis), and Django (for websites and that kind of stuff). It is easy to download on most platforms and there are a lot of YouTube videos about installing it and getting started as well. Hope this helps! 
people don't seem to understand your humor mate
For what platform? Discord, Skype, etc. etc. 
I first came across this terminology on hard drives. 
I wrote RSS reader for Linux terminal.
&gt; Use of the term 'penetration testing' in security because it can taken as a sexual reference You say it ironically, but a coworker of mine once made it into a rape joke in a lesson's title.
So, I think this works. I'm sure there are better ways to factor prime numbers, but I wrote this solution quickly. As general feedback: 1. Spacing in Python is important 2. Using an editor or linter will help with making your code more readable My final solution's output would be in the "run function". As others have mentioned, using "open" is a good idea since it will close the file once the data is read. the "__iter__" method of TextReader allows for the file to be iterable. If all of your file's data is in a single line, then you can simplify the method, but the "yield from" return on the "__iter__" function allows for taking multiple items over multiple lines and processing it like a single, continuous stream. When you have a large dataset, this is useful as it does not put the data in RAM/memory. The prime function I have skips over any numbers that were previously found to be divisible. Also, you don't have to check numbers greater than the square root of the number you are checking. On my 2012 laptop, the following code runs in about 100 milliseconds (ignoring reading the file from disk). I hope this helps. ```python class TextReader: def __init__(self, path: str, delimiter: str): self.path = path self.delimiter = delimiter def __iter__(self): with open(self.path, 'r') as file: for line in file: yield from map(int, line.split(self.delimiter)) class Analyzer: def __init__(self, numbers): self.numbers = numbers self.primes = PrimeNumber() self.count = 0 def run(self): for n in self.numbers: self.count += 1 self.primes.is_prime(n) def report(self): print('Numbers ran: {}'.format(self.count)) print('Divisible Numbers: {}'.format( self.primes.divisible_numbers)) @classmethod def from_file(cls, path, delimiter=' '): return cls(path, delimiter) class PrimeNumber: def __init__(self): self.prime_numbers = set([1, 2]) self.divisible_numbers = set() self.largest_prime = 2 def is_prime(self, x): if x in self.prime_numbers: return True elif x % 2 == 0: self.divisible_numbers.add(x) return False elif x in self.divisible_numbers: return False else: sqrt_x = x // 2 + 1 for i in range(3, sqrt_x, 2): if x % i == 0: self.divisible_numbers.add(x) break else: self.prime_numbers.add(x) return True def run(path): numbers = TextReader(path) analyzer = Analyzer(numbers) analyzer.run() analyzer.report() ``` 
If that file should have different permissions then change its permissions to what they should be. Hard to say much more than that without details.
Ah, slavery is a no-go, but classism? That's ok. Pick up that can, *worker*.
You start dropping context, and you can make anything mean anything. "Master/slave" is an old term, with a lot of uses in tech and mechanics. Hyper-wokeness won't change that. 
It does cost something to adjust, it costs time and effort on the part of everyone reading the documentation to determine what these new terms mean and how they fit into the existing terminology we use in IT. It's widely known what a master/slave relationship will look like. It's less certain what a main/helper relationship will be. Did the main spawn the helper? Is it a subprocess or another parent level process that takes commands from main? Why am I having to think about this when I knew the answer before this change?
One merit is certainly consistency in naming convention , all the guides/documentation which master/slave are obsolete now.everyone needs to update code to target latest versions Programs have vey very long lives. Move to python 3 has not fully happened yet after 10 years. If this was the naming convention from the start then fine, but changing it now is a poor design decision. 
You are right on. Thank you. 
Apparently “mounting” a drive is “insulting...sickening...and incredibly offensive” Holy shit A lot of these older terms come from physical media days. Like physically mounting a drive in a case/room. Man page is short for manual I’m fairly certain, so person page or whatever the fix would make zero sense. Blackbox/Whitebox makes perfect sense in terms of illumination, and is a pretty clear description. White = illumination = you know what’s happening. Black = no illum = you can’t see. Do they not know the origins of most of this shit? Fsck is a pretty ridiculous complaint too. File system check. Could have a better abbreviation, but now they’re complaining that a word simply has similar letters to an “offensive” word. We should rename dams while we’re at it. 
Now term "worker" used in python offends me. It must be changed.
I can't find the link now, but the way they worded it was very misleading. Throughout learning the language I was waiting for the lesson or tool that shows you how to just write out what you want to do and it never happened. Go figure! Thank you for the response. :) I do see how the syntax is more simplified than the C programming I did in the past.
Not bad for your first program. How about putting all that in a function, calling the function and even adding parameters. 
I tend to use master/slave to denote processes and "worker" as a completely separate entity like a microservice.
How simple are we talking here? If you can define a map of possible inputs you might just be looking at a dictionary. Make a dictionary with keys that are the possible inputs and values that are your desired response. Take the input and convert to lower case + remove any non alpha characters so you can handle: HoW are you!? And how are you as the same thing. If you can’t define such a mapping you are talking about natural language processing, and your mom oversold.
You can’t win it’s not that kind of argument.

This culture war stuff is getting obnoxious. Language police are not fun.
What a load of unnecessary bollocks.
I always found funny how society taught children about "bees and flowers" and at the same time talk about male and female connectors in such a plain and obvious way.
I'm sure it was double plus ungood.
You attacked his opinion because he's Indian because they had a caste system that is still having significant effects in India today. That's an ad homenim fallacy. Why should I trust any opinion from any white person from the US, when the US condoned slavery, still has a major problem with race relations, and has a President that refuses to say Nazis are bad?
If i remember correctly MIT have some open courses for Python on YouTube.
Sorry, are you trying to apply a pragmatic approach to languaje? To use it to convey information just because it describes a concept? What a monster. /s
Well what should I do with all my master git branches?
## $1000 (USD) for a direct recommendation Hi, I'm a Python / Django developer and I need to get a **remote** dev job in a timely manner, so I figured I should use some help to speed up the search period. I'm committing to pay a portion of my first paycheck. # The terms are as follows: If your efforts directly lead to a job offer **that I accept**, I will pay you **$1000** out of my first paycheck. $1000 for a $50k salary, and another **$1000** for every $5k higher than that. The job has to be in my field or related (otherwise I will probably not accept it). Examples of such efforts include: putting me in contact with someone, recommending me for a position you or someone else is leaving. **Please note**: your efforts have to directly lead me to the job that **I actually get** (not just a simple recommendation) PM me if you have any questions.
I’m not white nor do I agree with the thoughts of white people collectively. You can be an Indian or any race for that matter and be a white supremacist, that’s possible. It’s funny because he said he didn’t find it offensive (master slave) terminology, but then again he doesn’t find his own racist culture offensive? That’s why I thought I’d point out, where’s the standard of morality? Surely it’s not coming from you. 
You might find the “requests-html” library useful since it can handle js
You can whine about Guido, but no one is stopping you from forking the project. No one is stopping you from doing literally anything else other than whine on Reddit about a project you have no intention of contributing to. &gt; I'm not the one who created a change request You're the one continuing to virtue signal with your posts, though lol. &gt; You applauded his "effecting real change" repeatedly. / Your issue is with people discussing submissions related to Python on a website dedicated to discussion. No, I am pointing out, in a thread full of people whining, that complaining that this contributor was merely whining is 1) not the truth, they put their time and effort where the mouth was and 2) *incredibly ironic*. &gt; You also used the swastika as your "tipping point" to say you decided you were fine with the change. No, I said I understood why the change was made. You claimed I glorified and approved of it. Do not put words in my mouth. 
&gt; where’s the standard of morality? Surely it’s not coming from you. What? Uhh...my standard of morality came from my upbringing, life experiences, and my own beliefs. I don't see why you attacked someone for growing up in a different cultural system. Attack ideas. Yes, he came off as racist. That's separate from him being Indian. You didn't attack the issue in your response. You attacked him for a non-relevant reason. I don't see the point in having a hissy fit over Victor Stinner making the decision to remove master/slave terminology from documentation. The decision is consistent with the PSF's tradition of promoting diversity.
This is closing in on saying that the day/night cycle is racist because its dark at night, and some people prefer the day when its light.
I’m not the best or most articulate person when it comes to expressing myself. Neither am I the most sociable person. My goal isn’t to attack whole cultures, just to point out hypocrisy where I see it. Yes; western culture isn’t any better, but let’s not act like these problems don’t exist because they don’t face you (Racists in general, or those in “denial”). I don’t talk about race because I find it’s a waste of time for more reasons than one. These people are smart enough to know they’re being prejudice and insensitive but they don’t care, that’s the problem. 
decent post, but gold? 
This is really easy. If your mom wants you to learn Python as part of the deal, look up hello world and go from there.
Comrade citizen who is a member of Bolshevik party and comrade citizen who is not a party member. 
I am always amazed that these people always end up getting a lot of power. 
How do I correct it though?
Look at the permissions on the file/directory it's complaining about and change them to something accessible by your user. 
What if the program consented to play the master/slave role term like in BDSM?
Da, double good!
Head over to r/learnpython as you may get a response there.
"Diversity of appearance, not in thoughts" to be precise.
Python is used all over the place. Dropbox, Google, Instagram, Facebook, NASA, etc. Python is much more effective than e.g. Java or C. Since Python is much more expressive than those lower level languages it enables developers to solve products quicker and make systems that are easier to maintain because lines of code per feature is much lower.
Gob Bluth has an interesting tutorial on this.
Wow, you have an unhealthy relationship with Wikipedia. Could you show me in the doll where it touched you? But seriously, Wikipedia is not an academic source, but it is a good spring point to get you started. You can always follow the citations, which will occasionally lead to citeable sources. It also gives to an idea of _what_ you should be searching for. In that sense, it can be a great focusing tool. When I was in school, it was a perfectly serviceable tool for starting research, and then I'd find citeable sources to actually verify what I'd found.
The fucking state board of education is a group of unhinged busy bodies that make the president actually look like a very stable genius. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/14/texas-board-ed-votes-to-pull-hillary-clinton-other-historical-figures-from-social-studies-curriculum.amp.html &gt;In addition, the board voted to add Billy Graham -- the famed evangelist who died earlier this year -- back into the curriculum. They are quite literally religious terrorists.
Holy shit, the red pill is leaking. The magnitude of outrage over the changes is orders more than anything that led to the changes. Have you people literally got nothing else to worry about? It’s a few words that matter to *some people*. It’s not that big a deal. Oh no slippery slope! The world is ending! The virtue signalling blinds me! Idiots. 
Master Boot Record
Personally i think the whole change was ridiculous but you're totally on point, its scary how many people care about such minor things, looking at the threads and mailing lists, you'd think it's some sort of huge incompatible new version rather than changing the name of an internal variable. And i can't help but chuckle that one of the merges now uses "pliant children". Feels a tad creepy. Those accusing others of *outrage culture* hopefully tend to their own gardens first. 
The fact that it's documentation is irrelevant-- it is still a horrible precedent.
These alt-righters are all outrage-communists.
Only horizontal scaling allowed from now on, buying more RAM or better CPU's is hardware privilege!
There are probably at least five people who do, and I bet they use Twitter *a lot*.....
Not gonna respond to personal attacks. Have your tantrum, progress will continue with or without your assent.
&gt;man in the middle attack I've heard people using the term "people in the middle attack" some time ago in a German podcast from the chaos computer club. 
Language is full if ambiguity and nuances. If you can understand English, you know that words have different meanings depending on context. Descendants of slaves understand this just as well as you do. (For example, some black people call each other affectionally "nigger" even though that's an extremely racist word if used by a white person.) The only way anyone can be offended by seeing the terms "master" and "slave" in a technical manual is that the person is *extremely* stupid (even toddlers understand that words can have different meanings, so that's unlikely) or that the person is intentionally looking for something to be offended by. &gt; just because you or I only see those terms as technical doesn't mean everyone will You really think someone is reading the Python docs and thinks the words in there describe social or political ideologies and concepts instead of something related to programming with Python? Have you ever met a black person? They really aren't that stupid!
It doesn't work like that. Engineers use data sets in order to test their algorithms. Also there are a lot of stages where the code is tested on numerous test cases. This example tells me that the leading engineer, or the software architect were incompetent. Or even worse, the case test team failed to include some data sets. What makes an Asian or a black any better? They do not teach computer vision differently to a black or an Asian person any different than a white person.
Please refer to the comment that I made to another person.
Make a click instead of an interactive application. it would be a far better experience for both the user and the developer. Use click for making the cli.
So what's your point? People should not be allowed to grasp immoral social concepts? I can understand what slavery means in basic terms and derive other concepts from that without condoning slavery itself. And that's helpful because everyone understand the basics of slavery and therefore it's much easier for me to convey my idea to others. And because descendants of slaves aren't any stupider than descendants of non-slaves, they understand that I'm using slavery as a concept to explain something, not to suggest that they should be slaves.
Ignoring the fact that you first used the word idiotic and have 0 points to refute the argument at hand, I'm still unsure if you're a troll or just an insecure person; So I'm going to stop replying to your delusional comments. 
I'm not for promoting diversity. Instead I'd rather fight stuff that discourages diversity. Like, I wouldn't be for affirmative action, but I'd be against the KKK. Pushing for people going into fields leads to unqualified people being g shepherded in. I'd much rather do things like removing the stigma of programming being for the boys, and the barrier of entry being something so seemingly unattainable. My big problem with affirmative action and moves like it, very similar to politics outside of politics, is putting stuff where it doesn't belong. It's better in my eyes to make the make the pasture greener and let them come to it of their own volition than to shepherd them to a pasture you feel they need to be in but they shouldn't or don't want to.
"These SJWs are SO THIN SKINNED AND EASILY OFFENDED! I am now going to STOP USING PYTHON FOREVER! This is an ENTIRELY NORMAL RATIONAL REACTION!"
They are very different things. Changing names for clarity will be specific, case-by-case, and you can discuss the merits of each side in a fairly calm way. Despite the name, people don't get called racist for not wanting to use Hungarian notation. Changing terms to avoid potentially offending someone is quite different. It can still be worth doing, but it's different.
Master and slave have been picked as technical terms for exactly one reason – to connect the dots of human slavery and the relationship of one-way dependencies in the mind of the recipient. Which is understandable, it's a strong metaphor and well-suited to tell you something useful about how a system works. But *because* it is a strong metaphor I don't get why it's hard to accept that people for whom the concept of human slavery carries some weight don't want those dots connected by their technical documents. If a software project started calling their deletion process "pogrom", would you still argue that people who find that objectionable are just missing the context?
Why not just you captainduckduck?
Yes, that's what I'm trying to explain.
Look at Quandl. It even integrates with Pandas and Numpy just fine. 
Is there sign programming languages?
Sure. I look to Wikipedia not for the final word but for verifiable examples. The same thing other responders are providing. Thanks.
&gt; (last I checked) it is not installable on Fedora This is not true; the SDL mixer issue made Kivy unbuildable for about a week before it was fixed. You are still right though, in the sense that no pre-built packages exist for Fedora and the docs don't explain clearly how to do it (unless it's been updated recently, I know someone was working on it a while back). In any case, it's just down to installing the requirements and building from source. If you want I will dig up detailed instructions.. &gt; They have not updated their SDL hooks, and refuse to compile on the newer version that Fedora ships. This was resolved in release 1.10.1, plus the issue itself was fixed in Kivy master a few weeks after the breaking upstream change; unfortunately it took a while to reach a release version.. Aside, but this issue was really due to a "mistake" by the SDL2 maintainers (maybe "unexpected behavior" is more accurate). They suddenly changed an enum that's been part of the API since release 2.0, without deprecation notice or any other prior warning. The conventional approach would be to leave the old entries in the enum and maintain feature parity as close as possible, adding new entries as needed. Or at the VERY least, mark them as deprecated for a period of time before breaking it. There wasn't really much that Kivy could have done to avoid this issue, beyond not supporting all of mixer's advertised audio formats in the first place. It affected every single app that uses sdl2-mixer with support for all of its backends, not unique to Kivy..
It has to do with the bell curve: * Humans tend to form societies that produce more than the sum of their parts; * As such; certain behaviours and ways of thinking, etc become common, while others are shunned. (I.e. basic socialisation) * Thus, in each prosperous society, the herd pulls to the centre of the bell curve. If the society is not prosperous, people will be more inclined to the extremes. So the question becomes, is Silicon Valley part of a prosperous society? In their own right, perhaps. But as a part of the United States, it looks to be a whole lot of eggs in one basket. Also, given the nature of Silicon Valley is researching and developing technological solutions to problems/issues we face -- perhaps it is in societies best interest to have as many backgrounds represented as possible. Obviously, diversity should be meritocratic.

I am going to work on python 3 for ios this month. It will come. 
&gt; Any idea how to speed up the loading time? How does your load time compare to a completely dumb app? Ie, from kivy.base import runTouchApp from kivy.uix.label import Label runTouchApp(Label(text="Hello World!")) .. this should tell you something about the potential for improvement by offsetting initialization work. If this is equally slow, you may just be at the limit of your device. For example, if you have a slow SD card, that will be noticeable. Startup time is something that has been debated N times over the years, unfortunately there are some constraints, and no ideal solutions. I can only suggest you gather some more information about what causes it to be slow. In case you're not aware, the very first startup after installing / deploying the APK is extra slow; it extracts a ZIP file (again, slow SD card is bad news). Beyond that, you are generally looking at things that are a little complicated.. I suggest you search around the kivy and python-for-android repository issues, it has been discussed many places, for example someone has reported improvement with minifying code, [see the comments from 2017 in this issue](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/issues/202) In any case, if the dummy app is faster, there must be simple things that can close the gap. If it's still intolerably slow, I suggest 1) try it on a different device, and 2) try apps built by others. For example, build the touchtracer example on your local system, and compare it to the official app. That should tell you if something is off in your build environment (could be SDK/NDK version specific with your device os, for example)
Yeah go ahead and choose a different language because of a few tiny edits to some obscure bits of documentation, and burn your Nike's while you're at it.
@yawpitch, was actually a very basic article for the official python mailing 
How the hell can you be sued over that? What law does it break? That is the dumbest shit ever and the judge should've just immediately thrown it out.
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-August/053134.html please read entire thread to understand reason of article
Imagine removing "slave" and "master" from history books on slavery. I can't think of anything that denigrates the historical abuse more than the removal of the meaningful words.
Dick in ages.
This is retarded. New group steps in as a decision makers and this is the first thing they do? Python is doomed.
PuLP may not be the first choice, and perhaps you are suggesting `scipy.optimize.linprog`? PuLP can be useful in certain scenarios. Once I struggled [to find a solution to do **integer** linear programming](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49325820) for couple of days, until I discovered PuLP. It was really easy to install, learn and implement -- although documentation was lacking.
&gt; It doesn't make the language better... It does nothing for the language itself. I disagree - if it makes it nicer for people to use, that's an improvement. Just because it doesn't matter to you doesn't mean it has no impact on the language. &gt; On top of that, it has a much-higher-than-nil cost to everyone else. It is new terminology, which means new coding practices, new educational material, revised documentation, a healthy round of refactoring in existing code. All in the name of... What? I explained what value it offers. I think that cost is very low - those changes are simple to make, and it isn't a change that is hard to map over if you find something older that uses the old terms. &gt; They do not reference institutionalized slavery, which is the history you are referring to. They do not reference anything beyond the relationship between components/resources. People are telling you they disagree, and they are the ones experiencing the issue - why do you think you know better than them how they feel about it? &gt; Drawing a correlation between software components and the slave trade is ridiculous, and is why people are shitting on this. No one is claiming that the two things are somehow equivalent, it's about how a reference affects them - my example about naming something with references to the holocaust should be obvious - would you be OK with naming a piece of software for killing processes "gas chamber", "holocaust" or "Auschwitz"? Would you find it "ridiculous" if Jewish people (or Roma or one of the many other groups affected by the holocaust) had an issue with it? If my grandparents have told me of the horrors of a concentration camp, described the deep pain and loss to them, their culture and those they loved, you think it's insane people might not want to have to have that referenced whenever they use software? Then, the same thing applies to slavery, which also left a trail of human tragedy. I can see how it would not be nice to have to see references to it when trying to work. &gt; If the words don't matter, why change them? The "benefit" is not worth the effort. My point was that people in this thread were saying they don't matter - and my point is the exact words don't matter to *most* people - but some people are hurt by these particular ones, so why not change them if everyone else doesn't really care? &gt; If the words do matter, why are you projecting a different context onto them? And shouldn't we then look at things like kill, terminate, probe, like you mention? Those have people who are reminded of painful stuff, too. It's not "projecting a different context", it's people telling us that those words make them uncomfortable. That's their experience, and minimising it just because you don't share it lets you brush it away, sure, but why not make the language better for them? As to other words, I'm happy to hear out anyone's issues with them, if they have them. I see no reason not to try and improve things for everyone.
My earliest memories are of setting HDD master/slave pins for my dad building out all those computers. I am terrible person for having nostalgia with these words, haha. 
Surprised I had to get this far down to find this. 
It is rampant in EE but I always thought it was strange terminology. Isn’t there a Brittany Spears song on this? What about Justin Timberlake...btw, I’m for the change.
Master &amp; slave isn't a racial slur; it doesn't even specify race. To even try to conform, limit, or define the scope to being a relationship Master/Slave of Antebellum would be a gross perversion of etymology. You're right, the bug submitter only states they find some phrase offensive &amp; submits a bug over this grievance that's polite enough; is that same action still polite when a mob follows parroting support; labeling common terminology bigotry? A mob comprised of people who may not, or may not even use the software? Master/Slave is well defined, common CS terminology that well defines a relationship between two things with a relationship.
I think this is a good change, especially when there are alternatives which would also accurately describe the behavior. I think context does matter, and I think that master and slave bring up connotations of the American slave trade which oppressed a specific group of people for hundreds of years. Regardless of the context it was intended for in Python, I think it makes groups that were oppressed by the slave trade feel more comfortable when using Python terminology, which is a good thing. 
If you have a package `mypackage` and want to be able to run it as `py -m mypackage`, you would make `mypackage/__main__.py`. If you do `from mypackage import __main__` (or `import mypackage.__main__` or any of the other host of ways to import a module) the name will then be `mypackage.__main__`. Why you would test with endswith, I have no clue - it's the same as using == in this case because it's not a package; it will always pass for \_\_main\_\_ in packages, because the two possible names are `__main__` and `mypackage.__main__`; and that prevents another module from importinf names from \_\_main\_\_ without running it.

Many years ago I worked with a big Burroughs B7900 and if a program crashed it would spit out something like "Process Aborted. Death in Family" and a whole bunch of crash stats. &amp;#x200B; We had a user who wanted us to change the phrasing of the error.
People should stop throwing the phrase virtue signaling just to mean somebody stood up for their particular beliefs. Also virtue signaling doesn't apply when you're on the assholes side of the argument. I'd also be curious to know just how many people of color you surveyed to find out how they feel about the terms. I do know people of color who have said they don't really love having the phrase slave thrown around in technical conversations. I've also heard from sales folks who really don't love having to use those terms when they wind up pitching something to a client who is black. I know in the communities where I've seen this discussed the people who are doing the most talking in defense of the terms are white. They haven't done much, if any, work to ask black people how they feel about the terms and if they're okay or not. They just fall back on the argument that it's always been this way and whether it's technically accurate or not. I do appreciate you pointing out that the changes are really not that drastic. It doesn't cost much to modify terms so that they're not offensive. 
&gt;You can whine about Guido. Pointing out your hypocrisy is not whining. &gt;no one is stopping you from forking the project. LMAO yeah let me fork Python real quick and spend time and effort replacing two words. I can *effect change!!1!1* and then you can celebrate me! &gt;about a project you have no intention of contributing to. You have no idea who I am or what I do. That is an incredibly stupid statement. I have no idea who you are. For all I know, you could be Guido himself. &gt;You're the one continuing to virtue signal with your posts, though lol. Expressing my opinion in a public forum dedicated to discussion of opinions is not virtue signaling. &gt;Do not put words in my mouth. That's rich coming from you. You said you were initially on the fence about the change, and then the swastika comparison pushed you over to the side where you are ok with it. That's approval, bud. You cheered on the change request submitter solely for putting effort into a change, regardless of the effort, meaning, or effect of the change. 
... And what about people who have been using the terms their whole career, but didn't get the memo. Should we be angry at them?
Excellent, glad to hear that! I vaguely recall there is another open project which does it already, I assume you are aware? If not I will try to dig up a link for it
&gt;I do know people of color who have said they don't really love having the phrase slave thrown around in technical conversations When talking about POC and minorities, I love how people exclude Latinos, Brown people and Asians. It's all about that one specific demographic that you want to pander towards.
Any takers for 'Lord and 'serf'?
Lol wrote code. You mean they had an IDE do a refactor of two words
This looks really cool, I'll give it a try at work on Monday!
&gt; There is no functional benefit to this change. There is no functional detriment either, to be fair. But it is not an improvement in any measurable way, it is a no-op for the language. Only if you view people's happiness and comfort with the language as "no functional benefit". It is a language feature to be nice to use, and that includes things like this. &gt; It doesn't matter how they feel to an extent, it matters what the words mean in the context that they are used. I entirely disagree - how the feel will determine if they want to use the language, and how they feel about doing so. Feelings are real. &gt; In this case, the concept of master/slave does not and has never been a reference to institutionalized slavery. No one is claiming that it was some kind of intentional reference in support of slavery or anything. That doesn't change the fact that the use of the words can bring up history that is painful, and be uncomfortable for some people. Again, I think the core of the issue is that people's feelings do matter. &gt; The change request submitter was asked why he submitted it, whether there had been any complaints that he could point to. He said yes, a couple, and all private complaints. So not only was it nowhere near a big enough group of people to give a shit either way until he submitted the change request, but they were not upset enough to go through with creating the change request themselves or to make a public statement regarding it. "until he submitted the change request" - I think people not believing they can make the change happen, or not even thinking it was possible to make a change like that could easily account for that. I don't think it is fair to discount everyone because they didn't come forward about it fast enough in some way. &gt; No, because those are meant to be direct references to historical events. They are meant to be offensive. &gt; You are not using an appropriate comparison. You're actually reinforcing my point, though, because master/slave is not an intentional reference to any historical events. Sure, there is a difference in how often those words are used, but I'd argue that the point stands. Bringing up slavery can understandably be uncomfortable for some people in much the same way. It's not about intent (again, I'm not trying to say the developers were intentionally trying to bring up slavery) - it's about effect. It sucks for people who have that history and don't want to be reminded of it. &gt; A better analogy would be to relate it to the other commands kill, terminate, probe, etc. I mean, are you going to change those terms because "someone's relative was killed in 9/11 and it makes them feel bad when they see the word 'kill'"? I think kill is such a non-specific word it is less likely to be a trigger for someone in that way. I think we should be mindful of our analogies and try to avoid anything that could be harder for someone to deal with, and if people came forward and said that those words were a serious issue for them, I wouldn't write it off, no. &gt; Except it isn't a reference to the slave trade, so none of that really applies. I think I've covered intent vs effect further up. &gt; No, the question is why change an innocuous terminology that has been in use for decades, does not reference any historical events, and would give zero tangible benefit to change. People are telling you they don't think it is innocuous, and I think how people feel *is* a tangible benefit.
Just give everything a uuid and just look up what each one does when you need to. Sure it will be super inefficient but no feelings will be hurt and that is what is really important. 
Better watch out, you're going to get fired for that. 
7 items list or 25min video. Hm.
You can just do `self.count = len(numbers)` and then you don’t need to increment inside `run`’s loop. 
You’re again missing the point: yes, things are tested with data sets but those aren’t magically immune to people being in a hurry or thinking narrowly any more than anything else. If someone assembled the test set out of images which are easy to get (and don’t require licensing) you’re going to end up with a set which over represents things software engineers in SF like to do. For that matter, how many decades of image processing code and academic papers used Lena just because someone brought a copy of Playboy to work in 1973? The point in both cases is that if the teams had been more diverse, especially at a decision making level, someone would have said “this didn’t work well when I tried it” and the team would have improved their test set before it made the international news. Remember the camera face detection which had dismal accuracy rates on dark skin? One engineer going “uh, wait a minute” would have prevented that. 
There is no definition of a DSL where this qualifies as a DSL.

Thanks! Ill try it out.
`return [x*x for x in range(start, end+1)]` 😉
Are you really? I dont think so.
I guess not, but that is OK with me. If people truly believe changing terms in a programming language will make the world a better place...well...so be it. College has failed to teach any logic to students and we are all suffering from it. Ignorance is bliss and being outraged about every little word and thing in the world is cool right now. I guess even technology is not spared... However, I would not hire a programmer who cannot tell the difference between technical terminology and the history of slavery. IMO, that is a bad engineer and has the reasoning skills of a three year old. 
No one is saying master slave is a racial slur. I was using the example of a racial slur to say that saying language makes you uncomfortable is not trying to control someone else's speech. There are many words that the etymology and real meaning have no ill intentions, but through time have been perverted. The concept of a master who has slaves is clearly something people feel is non inclusive to many people. Again, there's no detriment to changing the language in this case. Why not do it? There are other words that can describe the relationship. Another example would be , many textbooks would refer to programmers as men. The simple act of making references gender neutral, has a much wider impact.
Here! And there! And worst of all, there! It was very traumatic. I feel bad even telling the doll what happened. The trauma and horror!
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/programming] [Fether.Blog - Let's Create Our Very Own Bitcoin - Part 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9g1gwd/fetherblog_lets_create_our_very_own_bitcoin_part_0/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
This is pure anecdote, but I know plenty of black folks that think people who get offended at the mention of the word slave are batshit crazy. A couple of these are very passionate about their family history and have shown me preserved emancipation papers of direct ancestors. Their opinions toward other black people publicly representing the community as a whole is akin to how most liberals consider Trump as representative of all Americans' principles.
You are basically describing me people that are incompetent in their work. You somehow equate skin colour with diversity of ideas. The issue is incompetence, not lack of diversity. A good engineer, regardless of it's skin colour would've thought of those factors. Same goes for testers, etc.
Why? What does background have to do with any of this? A gay person would utilize mathematics in a different way than a straight person just because he's gay? That is just preposterous. Engineering is based on logical implementations, having a different background doesn't give you some advantage. Unless we're talking purely about field experience.
Building an RSS feed? Or parsing one(or multiple) great little project and can be nice to combine reddit, news weather, sports all into one feed 
I was noor already forget. Any link would be welcome :) 
YOU DIDNT ASK THAT SERVERS CONSENT
Can we move on yet?
Turning slave into worker/helper makes sense. Turning master into main.. makes less sense. Master and Worker would have been the best choice, since slave is really the only word some people may find distracting/offensive Btw I use arch 
Because any possibility of appearing racist or sexist is an easy way to lose a job and be blacklisted (whoops) from the community. I think changing from master/slave is stupid because master/slave perfectly explains how it works. Would I argue with my boss about it or go on the news? Hell no. Remember the devs that got fired for making a dongle joke at a conference? This is a pattern. 
Sorry, but clarity in communicating the technical nature of the relationship of two things trumps hurt feelings associated with a specific instantiation of that relationship. If these hurt feelings are a genuine problem, changing parlance just treats the symptoms. The real solution is therapy.
Gay people can't vote for Trump?
A little Google shows African slaves arrived in the colonies in 1619, making slavery lasting 245 years, disregarding Irish slaves. 
Wait, so did they contribute to a project and refactor code or did they just whine? Either way, they still accomplished more than your posts in this thread have.
&gt; LMAO yeah let me fork Python real quick and spend time and effort replacing two words. Yeah, forking a large project is utterly unheard of. No one has ever done it before [because they were butthurt about inclusive language](https://github.com/ayojs/ayo). &gt; You have no idea who I am or what I do. That is an incredibly stupid statement. Here's your grand opportunity to prove me wrong. I'll stand by my assertion that this is a project you have no intention of ever contributing to. &gt; Expressing my opinion in a public forum dedicated to discussion of opinions is not virtue signaling. By the very definition of virtue signaling, it is virtue signaling. &gt; You said you were initially on the fence about the change, and then the swastika comparison pushed you over to the side where you are ok with it. That's approval, bud. Clearly, you struggle with reading comprehension. Here's my post, so you don't have to continue pretending it says something it does not: &gt; At first I was on the fence about master/slave terminology, but the swastika analogy has made things clearer for me. I understand why master and slave are being met with objections, now. Understanding is not approval. I'm sure when the world appears as black and white as it does for you, this is "glorification and approval". &gt; You cheered on the change request submitter solely for putting effort into a change, regardless of the effort, meaning, or effect of the change. Again, reading comprehension must be challenging for you. Let me help you out: &gt; No, I am pointing out, in a thread full of people whining, that complaining that this contributor was merely whining is 1) not the truth, they put their time and effort where the mouth was and 2) incredibly ironic.
great job! 
It is widely agreed that Google, Apple, HP, Facebook, etc. are all incompetent and have no good engineers. Clearly you should apply for management roles there to set them straight. Alternatively, there might be something to the decades of scientific research on subtle bias and perhaps these diversity efforts are the result of people realizing that they do have blind spots and actively trying to correct them. 
Well, this way we know that the person who suggested the change is politically motivated.
but think of "muh diversity!!!"
This is the one I had in mind (check the branches), https://github.com/pybee/Python-Apple-support 
I don't see the point of these wrappers around arg parsing. argparser is not difficult or more verbose than it needs to be. Introducing a foreign dependency seems like a waste. What's the worthwhile difference between these two, really? Why abstract command line parsing more than argparse? this: data = { "prog": "git", "description": "These are common Git commands used in various situations", "arguments": [ {"name": ["-v", "--version"], "action": "store_true"}, {"name": "--debug", "action": "store_true"}, ], } parser = cli(data) args = parser.parse_args() this: ap = ArgumentParser(prog="git", description="These are common Git commands used in various situations") ap.add_argument('-v', '--version', action="store_true", help='Show script version number.') ap.add_argument('-d', '--debug', action="store_true", help='If given, display debug output."') args = ap.parse_args() And your package is python3 only. So you add dependencies and remove functionality. I don't get it.
5*5 = 25 6*6 = 36 Therefore any number between two squares is not a perfect square.

Looks like [this](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python)
Obviously that’s your opinion and it’s a valid one, it’s just not one that I share.
This could be the most ridiculous thing I've seen ever in the world of programming.
Sorry, it seemed a bit frustrated to me, and I thought it was funny, but I got your point. For me at least is useful and I like it, I don't think it's a waste. I've also added a few checks for common mistakes and I think adding groups and exclusive_groups is easier, I find argparse's documentation to be quite confusing (it might not be the case for you). Cheers!
Wow...is that really your last name :) very cool project.
Could you provide some examples of both \`fork\` and \`chain\`? Are there any other library's public functions?
Yes there are. The source code is small, so I just embedded the documentation in there, you can check it out. I haven't provided more examples yet though.
Thanks. Can you update the formatting? (I'm not sure the code has been included properly.)
`apply` function uses mutable default argument. It should be avoided, as it is [a possible source of bugs](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments). You have: def apply(func, args = (), kwargs = {}): ... Instead, you probably should have: def apply(func, args = (), kwargs = None): if kwargs is None: kwargs = {} # rest of the function &amp;#x200B;
I never mutate them, so no problem there.
Great idea indeed, thanks for the code!
It's great to stand up for beliefs when people are actually wronged. For example, after the white Dallas police officer who fatally shot a black man in his apartment after her key wouldn't work because she had the wrong apartment. I think it's great to have a national conversation over appropriate use of police force, training police to de-escalate situations without force, inherent racial biases, and how police should not be authorized to use deadly force against unarmed civilians who aren't threatening them (even if they suspect them of a crime). This isn't virtue signaling it's trying to prevent repeat incidents. But getting into arguments with others non-harassing use of language is virtue signaling (especially when it is accurate and appropriate with a [modern definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/slave)). It's equivalent to conservatives getting upset over use of "Happy Holidays" or "Xmas" instead of stating Christmas, who signal their virtue about how they are fighting to keep Christ visible. (Harassing use of language is different -- it's fine to stand up against people using language to deliberately harass people or using racial/ethnic epithets.) You understand modern slavery affects all races (both as slaveowner and slave) and people of color do not uniquely own the plight of slavery. Further you shouldn't make assumptions about other's racial identities. But yes I am personally aware of people of color who think getting offended by use of the word master or slave is ridiculous (several of whom who worked to get Master degrees). Ultimately, I don't care about this because the new documentation works just as well as the old documentation and it can't break anyone's code.
What are some of its advantages over the built-in PyCharm debugger?
It's not this instance that is the problem, but rather the precedent that it sets.
I think adding doctests could provide some nice examples. Also, you get tests basically for free.
Generally you are right, but for a function that streight forward I really don't think this will ever be an issue.
You're still not getting the point. There's no point to fork Python-- Python didn't change. Either way, open source is more than just "if you don't like it, fork it". It's community. The problem is the *precedent* that such a change sets. Because this toxic state of SJW "I'm offended" has been crawling into open source projects one by one.
Amazon and Oracle also have active python communities. The majority of their front end services are written in java. Back end services are a bigger mix. I’ve only seen C languages used for things doing high speed packet processing. Anything that would be cpu bound and harder to horizontally scale. If you are working as a developer, I like the advice someone once told me. Learn a new language every year. Even if you don’t end up using it. I started with python and then learned C#, Java, Scala, and JavaScript (React). I don’t use C# or Scala, but it is useful to understand the differences between languages. Python, Java, and JavaScript are a great combination. If you can master those three, you should not have any problems finding work. Code Reviews are critical in mastering a language. Linters, such as pylint and eslint, help too. If you are a student, look into jetbrains student licenses for their IDEs. Their analyze code feature provides some of the benefits of a code review. It is not a substitute, though. Static code analysis will only catch syntax or style errors, it won’t help with logic errors. I think my next two languages are going to be TypeScript and Go. Good luck!
So we agree this instance wasn't actually problematic. Unlike the legal world, open-source pull requests aren't typically decided on based on past precedent, so I can't get riled up over precedent. Again, initially reading these comment threads, I thought there was actual user-facing code changes somewhere in python that was getting changed. That I would oppose for the unnecessary headaches that renaming would impose. I still would oppose this.
The PyCharm debugger (and other similar traditional debuggers like pdb) require stepping forward one line at a time. With birdseye you immediately get a view of which branches are taken (not shown in the gif above, but try an if/else statement) and only step between loop iterations. You can go back if you accidentally step too far. You can also instantly see the value of any expression without any copy pasting or typing and without worrying about the side effects of evaluating an expression. When you have a complex expression in a single line and you want to look at all the intermediate values and how they combined to give the final result, it's great. I love the PyCharm debugger and still use it most of the time. I think birdseye is better in some situations but there's no clear winner. I encourage you to give it a try, it's easy to get going and you can still choose which tool to use at any time.
So I installed the plugin in PyCharm but adding the @eye decorator is causing a NameError on execution. The plugin is enabled - what am I missing?
I’ll need to see your code or is this a tutorial you’re working on?
The plugin doesn't impact the running of the program, it only views the data collected by birdseye. You still need `from birdseye import eye`. When the server fails to start there should be a balloon notification with output from the server including a traceback, can you copy that in? If you can't find the balloon check the event log. You can also run the server yourself with the command `birdseye` in a terminal. Of course you also need to have birdseye installed in your Python interpreter. The plugin should have prompted that automatically (did it?) but in case that didn't work just `pip install birdseye`.
Actually, you need to be careful with doing something like that. If numbers is a generator, calling len on it will cause an error.
Good point. I hadn’t looked at your `TextReader`. 
Cheers ^^ I waited for it instead of going to the mirror.
Just installed the plugin on a Windows machine - no prompt to install the birdseye package, seems to have done it on its own. I was able to get the server started from Settings but it crashed shortly after: java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface com.jetbrains.python.packaging.PyRequirement, but class was expected at com.github.alexmojaki.birdseye.pycharm.ProcessMonitor.start(ProcessMonitor.java:107) at com.github.alexmojaki.birdseye.pycharm.ProcessMonitor$1.run(ProcessMonitor.java:82) at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:555) at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:505) I restarted PyCharm but have been unable to get the server to start from the IDE.
_Details_ What file are we talking about, what are the permissions on it, and what error do you get?
Thanks for the traceback. That's actually the plugin checking if it needs to install birdseye so it didn't get to prompting you. It's failing because the PyCharm API changed a class to an interface and broke binary compatibility. Looking into what I can do about it now.
Cool, thanks! I started the birdseye server from a commandline (python -m birdseye) and told PyCharm to connect to an external server at the given URL. However, I'm not seeing any birdseye tab (near Debug, TODO, etc.) so I can't explore its use. I'm hoping that just has to do with the issue you're investigating, or that I'm just so dense I'm missing something...
but that's slippery slope then since it's not a causal connection
it makes me wonder how much of it is alt-right outrage mongering and how much is people getting swept up in it over some misunderstanding of what "free speech" entails
This is true but - it doesn't mean that diversity and political correctness are bad just because they're cynically deployed by companies looking to avoid discussion about actual material inequalities. Political correctness and diversity are still good things, they just don't go far enough. The words were obviously not meant to glorify slavery but - there's synonyms that work as well. Primary/Secondary, Parent/Child etc. It's not a big deal to use those instead.
Ah, but when you set the legal definition of man to be "land owning citizen" it is no longer a contravention at all! Understanding the semantics of the Constitution helps to put into perspective how people could still uphold such "inalienable" rights, while simultaneously appearing to alienate a large portion of the population from said rights.
So good point! If I'm literally just "glue writing" between other applications - is there an optimal framework suited for connecting back ends? I'm eventually going to be connecting all of this to Jira to drive a ton of infrastructure automation.
I'm not wasting my time looking at everyone's bio of course but you can tell that plenty of people are kind of against it but don't really give a shit and then the anti-SJW crew who, if you look at their bio post all day every day about evil, fascist libruls, white-genocide, evil jews and (((globalists))) etc. If the majority of objections came from the former group I wouldn't care much but the latter group seem to be getting a whole lot of upvotes.
Yep, did that, and ran a unit test that tests the decorated method (using pytest). Even put a breakpoint right after the call to the decorated method but still not seeing any eye icons show up. Checked the console running birdseye, found a message saying to set the OUTDATED_RAISE_EXCEPTION env var to 1, but once I did that and re-ran my test, nothing appears in the console. It's unclear *what* I did to get the error message to appear in the first place - I've rerun the test multiple times and nothing is showing up now. I waited a few minutes and this finally did pop up (sorry for crappy formatting, you can thank the Windows command prompt): Exception in thread Thread-2: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_ inner self.run() File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\threading.py", line 763, in run self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\outdated\__init__.py", lin e 99, in check is_outdated, latest = check_outdated(package, version) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\outdated\__init__.py", lin e 44, in check_outdated latest = get_latest() File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\outdated\__init__.py", lin e 40, in get_latest response = utils.get_url(url) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\littleutils\__init__.py", line 227, in wrapper return func(*args, **kwargs) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\outdated\utils.py", line 2 9, in get_url return urlopen(url).read().decode('utf8') File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 171, in urlopen return opener.open(url, data, timeout) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 494, in open response = self._open(req, data) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 512, in _open '_open', req) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 466, in _call_chain result = func(*args) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 1326, in https_open context=self._context, check_hostname=self._check_hostname) File "C:\Temp\BL_CACHE\python\App\lib\site-packages\future\backports\urllib\re quest.py", line 1287, in do_open raise URLError(err) URLError: &lt;urlopen error [Errno 10060] A connection attempt failed because the c onnected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established c onnection failed because connected host has failed to respond&gt; Also, PyCharm seems to hang a little at the end of the test suite - the spinning wheel next to the test status in the debugger console never stops.
re: canvasses. Your explanation is fantastic. I can't find anything like it in the documentation. Please consider pasting it into a "Backends" guide. &gt; I think a lot of people won't like that tbh if you make it required. OTOH if you want to make it possible to pass a list of figures to show, I guess that's PR-able (not saying it would get accepted, but it doesn't look too bad to me). You are considering the current users of matplotlib. You should also consider potential users who are familiar with Python and not familiar with matplotlib. None of those people wants stateful libraries. I just can't agree with holding onto bad design even if the current users of that bad design don't want change going forward. &gt; I think the number of uses of add_subplot(2, 2, 1) (or even worse, add_subplot(221)) vastly outnumbers the number of uses of GridSpec. That's pretty gratuitiously breaking a lot of code out there in the wild. OTOH I agree that it should be better documented, I'll open an issue on the tracker for that... I'm not saying break it. I'm saying deprecate it. You can leave it deprecated for a five years if you have to. It's just a first step in moving your interface forwards to something reasonable. `add_subplot(221)` is not reasonable as you point out yourself. Anyway, at the very least, you should document GridSpec in the `add_subplot` documentation. And what if you want to `add_subplot(1, 1, 1)`. That should not require a GridSpec, explicit or implied. It should have its own SpanningSpec or something, or its own method. But most importantly, you should not be using add_subplot(112) or the like in any of the documentation. Unfortunately, this happens all over the place: https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html &gt; As I said: don't. use. anything. from. pyplot. except. for. the. few. functions. listed. above. This is great advice, and I promise I won't use pyplot except for figure(), subplots(), and show() as you recommend. I still think you should deprecate everything else in pyplot so that I would get the helpful warnings and would have learned this on my own. If that's too much of a stretch, then I think matplotlib's docs should at least not use any other methods. E.g., https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html In that example, whenever you have to add a comment to explain implicit behavior, it's better to just write out what is happening. Instead of: # plot a line, implicitly creating a subplot(111) plt.plot([1,2,3]) Just write: fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.subplot(1, 1, 1) ax.plot([1, 2, 3]) Especially, in documentation, it pays to keep things simple.
Thanks for your inputs!
The `outdated` stuff is birdseye checking online if it's the latest version. I appreciate the traceback so that I can look into this but it's far from critical and shouldn't be stopping your server from running. Open http://localhost:7777 in a browser to access the server and see if you can use the vanilla UI, no plugin. I've never thought of this before but it's likely that pytest and birdseye won't mix well since they both use AST modification. Try debugging something that doesn't involve pytest.
the other files that it does not appear to understand python syntax from are all "rwxrwxrwx"
so I figured out that I was missing the x part of rwx so that I can actually execute the file. I think I was also missing #!/usr/bin/env python3 on the top of my programs so that Komodo Edit will interpret it as python. Is there a reason that it would not know it is python even given the .py extension?
Maybe the wayback machine has it?
Yep, I'm seeing things in the browser UI, but not in PyCharm. Pretty cool! Definitely would like to figure out why PyCharm isn't displaying the eye icon though.
If we could avoid legal definition differing from broadly accepted usage we could do away with lawyers and for the most part, be much better off.
Are you sure that `birthday_calculator.py` is the file that you're getting the message with? There's no reason why `sudo` would change the permissions of your own files. I had expected that the permissions error would involve one of the bs4 files. I guess we should probably check the extended attributes too. Please repeat the same command again, but replace the `-l` with `-l@`. You can give the file directly to `ls` instead of giving it the directory and then filtering out everything you didn't want to show. That second issue that you're having just looks like you're trying to run the file with the shell instead of python. You didn't specify how you were running the file.
I haven't used Komodo Edit, but it shouldn't need either the executable permissions or the shebang. You should probably try adding them just to make sure. I don't think the permissions on that file changed at all, because I don't think this has anything to do with the issue.
it seems the external server setting needs to be enabled and running BEFORE pycharm is ran, &amp;#x200B; at least, that seems to be from my testing, &amp;#x200B; without doing it in that order the eye icon didn't appear with me,
In what format, protocol or in what way are they response given by those applications that you will like connecting??
Isn't that expensive? 
What do you mean by give file directly to ls instead? The following is what I get when I did it for all python files in the folder. the birthday\_calculator was the only that had permission issues, not sure how or why, but it runs if I use the shebang in KE-11. Samuels-MBP:~ Sam1$ ls -l@ "/Users/Sam1/Documents/LinkedIn Trainings/Python/Ex_Files_Learning_Python/Exercise Files/Ch3" total 72 -rwx------@ 1 Sam1 staff 1073 Sep 15 15:26 birthday_calculator.py com.apple.lastuseddate#PS 16 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 1401 Nov 6 2017 calendars_finished.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 1265 Aug 20 12:32 calendars_start.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 936 Nov 6 2017 dates_finished.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 861 Aug 20 22:48 dates_start.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 1008 Nov 6 2017 formatting_finished.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 805 Aug 20 12:04 formatting_start.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 1386 Nov 6 2017 timedeltas_finished.py com.apple.quarantine 67 -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Sam1 staff 1343 Aug 20 12:20 timedeltas_start.py com.apple.quarantine 67 
you can use the library called numpy, and do the calculation with the help of the types of array that manages, numpy is very fast
It should definitely pick up the setting without the restart, but maybe you're running into some other bug. What version of PyCharm are you using? Were you also not able to run the server yourself?
I meant that you can run `ls -l@ ./path/to/birthday_calculator.py` instead of `ls -l@ ./path/to`. It's not important. So what exactly is the state of the issue now? You've changed a bunch of permissions, introduced a side issue, and some things run that didn't run before. I can't keep track of it all. Are you still getting errors?
Nope, it all is fixed now. Thank you for the help! 
Sorry, did some edits after the post
If nothing else works, perhaps someone made a full copy into their repository to use as a vendor dependency... Might take some digging to find that way though!

Your example actually made me think. I wouldn't make a fuss about it if someone else named some technical process "pogrom", but I also wouldn't do it myself. Although I'm not sure why. I wouldn't use "asshole" either, but I think that's because that kind of language always carries some kind of aggression with it, not because I think it might offend notorious assholes. Similarly, "pogrom" is some kind of dirty word. You didn't quite convince me, but you definitely weakened my opinion and I'll have to reflect more on this. Thank you. 
actually, I like this. well positioned argument.
OTOH, "broadly accepted usage" drifts over time, and legal definitions _need_ to be pinned to something to be useful. If the legal definition were allowed to drift along with the colloquial usage, we'd either need to spend a lot of effort constantly updating our laws, or we'd end up having law drift with language drift, undoing any sort of ability to rely on precedent, and having laws literally change over the course of time. Seems... not worth it.
OK, thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9g0uq4/ive_integrated_the_python_debugger_birdseye_into/e61ccrh/) by /u/sharkbound, I see what the problem is now. As they suggest, set the plugin to connect to an external server and then restart PyCharm. That's not supposed to be necessary but it works around this particular bug. I've submitted a new version of the plugin but there's a whole approval process for that which will take a few days.
If I can be so rude, saying slaves didn't exist in the United States until 1776 is like saying a penis didn't exist on Caitlyn Jenner until 2015: the penis was always there, the only thing that changed was the name.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

This is a good question, without a solid answer. I will try to give my insite to your questions, but you may disagree with some of it. 1. Units: for scientific project I would use International System of Units (SI) as a default. In case it saves (a lot) to use km instead of meters, or hours instead of second, I would mention it in the variable name.

I'm not sure I agree that both groups are virtue signaling. Certainly those advocating for the change are, but some of those arguing against the change are doing so merely because the existing terminology has a meaning that they understand and agree upon. To try and introduce new terminology in documentation is to them a source of potential confusion. I'm not sure what virtue they would be signaling in that argument.

You should use list() when you have a specific reason and otherwise default to square brackets. One example: you have some iterable (like the output of pathlib.Path.glob()), and you want to convert it to a list without any transformation or filtering where you might use a list comprehension. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list

You got it man, so for now as a finished product I'm gonna plug in all of my probabilities for draft grades of 8.0-4.5, anything generated above or below that I'm gonna apply the same probability as the 8.0 or 4.5. As far as the probabilities, they might be changed as I test out the system. I'm using your original Fuzz functions and I used (45, 10) as the average and Standard deviation, this generates the draft grades with there being a few 70 or highers and then a lot of 60s and up for the first and second rounds. My code is really long, but it's actually fairly simple. I'm just not sure how I could turn that into a for loop. So the sequence is gonna be, do the draft tin madden, run the fuzz function, go down the list of picks and input each draft grade into my probability code and that will apply the probability to that player and give them their overall. If you want to see the code you're more than welcome to. I'm not fully finished with inserting the proper probabilities yet so maybe I'll post that when I'm finished. By the way right now I'm a freshman at Binghamton University and the course I'm taking is CS 110. So just the basic single semester python course.
&gt; To try and introduce new terminology in documentation is to them a source of potential confusion. Go through the handful of documentation cases that changed; none of them became less accurate or more confusing. Several of them are clearer and more consistent with the code and terminology elsewhere: * the first example in `gc` talked about examples of `fork` (which before talked of `child process` and `master process`, but now talks of `parent process`, which is the terminology of `man fork` that you learn in an OS class and no longer a mixed metaphor). * "#Force different suites on client and ~~master~~ *server*" followed by unchanged code that reads `client_context.set_ciphers("AES128")` and `server_context.set_ciphers("AES256")`. So now using the same terminology as the code. * "- buildbot: Batchfiles for running on Windows ~~buildslaves~~ *buildbot workers*" (where buildslave is an old term in the Buildbot documentation that has been replaced with workers in recent versions). Again, I'd be against these changes if they changed user facing code or created confusion; but it doesn't seem to be the case in any of these examples. As for virtue signaling, there are plenty of people who thinks its virtuous to resist the language police and NOT be politically correct (e.g., President Trump in Aug 2015 tweeted: [Political correctness is killing our country. "weakness."](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/630007166129303552)).

Not the cleanest solution but you could attempt something like this 
Might not be the cleanest solution but could you try something like this? wrong_list = ['A B Intl', 'AB Intl Company', 'A &amp; B intl'] keywords = ['Intl', 'AB', 'intl'] fixed_list = [] for item in wrong_list: for keyword in keywords: if keyword in item: item = 'A&amp;B International Company' fixed_list.append(item) for x in fixed_list: print(x) 
Not sure how clean this is, but would something like this work? You can add patterns into the wrong_list to find matches. Might depend on how many different entries there are. wrong_list = ['A B Intl', 'AB Intl Company', 'A &amp; B intl'] keywords = ['Intl', 'AB', 'intl'] fixed_list = [] for item in wrong_list: for keyword in keywords: if keyword in item: item = 'A&amp;B International Company' fixed_list.append(item) for x in fixed_list: print(x)

Generally I think that if you feel your code matches the goals you set for it - you nailed it. Is it scalable? Intuitive to use? Have all the functionalities you planned? If it's open source, then send a link to your repo in Github so other people can read it and give you feedback. And to your specific points: 1. There's a nice lib called pint, which handles units quite well. Try transforming the consts you have now to this lib's objects. https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 2. Do you mean visualizing to yourself or to the users? 3. In my perspective, if the user can find the info he needs easily in your doc - good enough. It doesn't really matter if you wrote less code then doc. 4. This sounds weird to implement a solver for each equation. There are so many math laws and rules which can complicate your solver, and it'll be hard to follow these rules and support them all. (like trying to get a in this equation n=b^a +a a). Good luck!

I don't see which specific question you're referring to. But it doesn't really matter; a random crosspost on Reddit that is so lacking context that you have to complain to be pointed at sufficient context to discover is meant to be some sort of not-obviously solicited response to a difficult to find question halfway down a rambling and at times nonsensical thread on the Python mailing list doesn't make for useful communication of ideas.

This will get you the path to the running file. import os base_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(file)) If you have a folder called "files" in your project and you add "test.xlsx" to it, you can get the path with os.path joins. file_name = "test.xlsx" file_path = os.path.join(base_path, "files", file_name) Using os.path you'll be platform agnostic and also resolve symlinks.

&gt;Two Jews in a Vienna café in the 1930s. One of them is reading the Yiddish newspaper, while the other one peruses the Der Stürmer, the Nazi propaganda organ. The Jew reading the Yiddish newspapers asks accusingly “Why are you reading that Nazi rag?” The other Jew responds: “I used to read the Yiddish newspaper, and all it talked about was how Jews are suffering, being fired from their jobs, being subject to pogroms and starving. Now I read in the Nazi newspaper that we control the world. I prefer the good news!” &amp;#x200B;
Good. Glad we're both aware of your problems with navigating the Dunning-Kruger curve. It would help if your article a) explicitly stated its intent as a response to that thread, b) stated which particular point(s) in the _many_ disparate and unrelated points within that thread the article is meant to address, and c) did so in a manner that didn't sound high handed and arrogant without first demonstrating _any_ justification for either of those two qualities.
No to the second answer of course.

the fuck is wrong with you? I'd ask something like that just to see if I will get an answer. it doesn't mean that he's racist. 
it did say `KeyError: body`
And at that time, as far as i know, Black was synonym for Ink. If you put something in black, it meant to write it down in ink.
Sure. Which is why they stay in a threaded email, so when you make the 29th reply it includes a quote of statement in the 5th reply that you're addressing: the medium chosen implicitly and explicitly presents metadata that can discerned by the reader. You've replied out of band in a different medium, then attempted to spread your message via the use of a third medium, neither of which presents anything like that metadata. The article dropped with _zero_ context; you attempt to bring context in your comments of "read the entire thread", but that doesn't allow the casual reader any foothold, and the less than casual reader asks for greater clarity and instead gets "read the entire thread". As a metatextual statement on just _why_ DSL parsing is a _much_ harder and deeper a dive than your article implies, it's kind of interesting and funny... but I don't think that was the point.
Because these are the questions O was asking when I encountered the errors. Not all questions raised errors so I want to make sure OP can reproduce the results.
Serialization and object-relational mapping are two different things. Serialization is when you convert data into a format that can persist and be transferred elsewhere in such a way that the original data can be sufficiently recreated from the serialization in a process called deserialization. Object-Relational Mapping is an abstraction layer that allows you to work with relational databases as if they and their constituent parts were objects, i.e. you're "mapping" the "relational" data to "objects" = ORM.
At least he made something cool and simple. And it’s more for conversation than utility. It’s a chatbot not a search engine. Last time I checked google didn’t tell me what it’s favorite cheese was

Good point - I am using the wrong vernacular - compliments of being out of the game far too long. Regardless - seeing above: do you have any suggestions for frameworks I could be using for "Glue writing"?
if you have any more suggests for the site, drop them, like variety, article depth etc

Engineering is not a humanitarian field of studies where feelings are taken into consideration. The only thing that matters is results. A team full of black engineers could've made the same mistake because neural networks are a bitch to make them work correctly, and when you implement this vast classification network, a ton of mistakes such as that accidentally racist error, are bound to occur. Hire a ton of black people, gay people, trans people. They will face the same challenges, make the same mistakes, because it is how neural networks work. Laws of physics apply the same to all, same goes for engineering.
I don't think I've ever heard a (decent) Python programmer shit talk C considering the relationship between the two languages. Then again, I haven't seen much hate directed at Python either (other than some tongue-in-check "Write Pseudocode, indent it, et voilá you've got a python program"), I don't think message board banter should be taken _that_ seriously.
put labels on the axis of your plots, otherwise they are basically useless
Thanks for the feedback! It's true, if a reader saw the graph without context it wouldn't mean anything. I'll work on that.
Turns out I shouldn't have suggested Hamming distance here. It's not really applicable. But here's a Dice string distance implementation I found: # Gives a distance, or similarity between strings. 1.0 is an exact match, # 0 is completely different def dice(a, b): if not len(a) or not len(b): return 0.0 if a == b: return 1.0 if len(a) == 1 or len(b) == 1: if a == b: return 1.0 else: return 0.0 a_bigram_list = [a[i:i + 2] for i in range(len(a) - 1)] b_bigram_list = [b[i:i + 2] for i in range(len(b) - 1)] a_bigram_list.sort() b_bigram_list.sort() lena = len(a_bigram_list) lenb = len(b_bigram_list) matches = i = j = 0 while (i &lt; lena and j &lt; lenb): if a_bigram_list[i] == b_bigram_list[j]: matches += 2 i += 1 j += 1 elif a_bigram_list[i] &lt; b_bigram_list[j]: i += 1 else: j += 1 score = float(matches) / float(lena + lenb) return score
They accomplished what they sent out to do. They put their time and effort where their mouth was, which is more than what you're doing.
No, I get your point. You're offended that words got changed, even though Python didn't change and is just as capable as ever. What you're not understanding is that I'm *criticizing you for whining about being offended by a change that doesn't affect you and then doing nothing about it*, while painting the person *who did something about it* as a whiner. The irony is astounding.
I'd say it's mostly YouTube that spreads the idea that Python is the only good language. Usually it's channels that are made for beginners. It's kinda annoying sometimes.
I see it most prevalent in the Python fan base, but I do agree that all languages have fanboys.
I'm not talking about trolls.
Why do you think I'm a troll?
thank ,wasn't aware. the api will probably work better then the way I was doing it as well
See your post above. It's churlish, tiresome, and a complete waste of energy to read. It's also childish and the opposite of constructive. At best it's meant to get an equally vapid response from some "fanboy" or other, at worst it's just meant to offend. I know of _no one_ sufficiently advanced in any language to be considered an expert who also says theirs is the best language for every purpose, and I know quite a few experts.
In general, inheritance can end up to be quite messy: "favor composition over inheritance". Dependency injection provides more flexibility and less coupling than subclassing. What you're describing sounds like the decorator pattern: the Snake class wraps around the Animal class. In languages that have interfaces, Snake would implement the same interface as Animal. Calls to the Snake class can be relayed to the Animal class. Alternatively, if you need to compose and/or switch behavior at runtime, you could apply the Strategy pattern.
No it was not. You dismiss people's opinions because you disagree with them, that does not mean they are not valuable to be shared. The only difference between the people who changed some words and the people in this thread is that one group put their opinion in a pull request. They did not add functionality, they added their opinion. Just like people in this thread are doing but to you it does not matter unless some adds their opinion by refactoring some words and you also happen to agree with the opinion.
\&gt; So then why should I be held responsible for people being upset over something that doesn't matter, *especially* when that is not the intent nor the context? &amp;#x200B; Do you think that we could frame this such that it isn't about you at all? It's not, for the record. &amp;#x200B; I think I get it, you don't want to feel shame. But know that we still care about you just the same as before this documentation change occurred. &amp;#x200B; \&gt; If anything, I would say you're *hurting* the "healing" by forcing this change through. &amp;#x200B; Are you genuinely suggesting that the PSF is promoting racial division with this change? Could you elaborate more on that?
I'm sorry, but actually effecting change in the Python project is getting something done, while whining in the comments section of a news article like you are right now is getting nothing done.
&gt; The change affects everyone-- it's a precedent for removing words from our vocabulary. If you don't believe that, enjoy your doublespeak. Enjoy your hyperbole and the-sky-is-falling rhetoric. &gt; Undoing such a change has already proven to be futile based on Guido simply closing the discussion altogether. Again, projects much larger than Python have been forked because of ideological differences and "words". I'll continue to point to the ayo fork of nodejs as an example. &gt; I did not claim that Victor Stinner is a whiner, so I have no fucking clue what you're on about. Read the thread and you'll know. It's easy to confuse everyone here who compares this change to *1984*, lol.
*Some* Jews run *some* media.
Python is great for beginners, easy enoigh to get your programming streak going and versitale enoughto do all sorts of projects. That being said, its not the best language for everything, but you also shouldn't use youtube as your main source of information
Sorry you are wrong. You consider other people's opinions whining because they don't agree with you.

Your feelings are not the underlying laws of engineering, and it’s telling that you’re trying to dress attacks on people who are trying to prevent failures up as some sort of physical law rather than considering just why you’re so uncomfortable about accepting the problem isn’t as simple as you thought. Good engineers know that they aren’t working in isolation and keep the larger context in mind as they work. Similarly, your time would be much better spent gaining experience and improving the quality of your arguments than trying to pretend that you can speak on behalf of a large field. Even if you had a credible claim there’s a reason why argument from authority is considered a fallacy rather than a decisive argument.

By resources, do you mean a how to? If so. I forget the name, but there is a great YouTube tutorial. Search flask tutorial, or something like that. It shows you how to get an app.py off the ground. 
like anything . blogs, tutorials , anything . I have looked at the main but they dont really do what I want to learn 
I'd start with how to set up flask locally, and how to render a template. I recommend any flask tutorial and bootstrap to render template, it is what I use at work. You'll want a walkthrough for set up, YouTube for how yo create your first app.py, and bootstrap to create a basic html template. 
Tool looks awesome! I just tried to install the pycharm plugin into my 2016 pro... and it says *not compatible*. Is there an older version or a way to lower the min version requirement?
I can confirm that restarting PyCharm after enabling the external server option (and running it, obviously) brings the eye icon into PyCharm. I like the plugin, but I wish the birdseye debug inspections could appear while I'm also on the debug tab - having to hover over a value to view it means you can only view one value at a time, limiting its usefulness. Also, is the ability to step through loops supposed to track all iterations? I'm only seeing the first and last three iterations in any given loop, in both the web UI &amp; the PyCharm plugin.

Thank you 
&gt; having to hover over a value to view it means you can only view one value at a time, limiting its usefulness. Click on a value to show it in the birdseye tab. Then you can view multiple values, watch them change through iterations, and expand their contents. &gt; Also, is the ability to step through loops supposed to track all iterations? I'm only seeing the first and last three iterations in any given loop, in both the web UI &amp; the PyCharm plugin. No, what you're seeing is normal. If a loop had a million iterations and I saved them all it'd be a problem.

I doubt it'll harm your IDE, so you can try, but I don't think it'll work. I'm sure at least some things won't work. Does your license not let you upgrade?
&gt; Enjoy your hyperbole and the-sky-is-falling rhetoric. It's not sky is falling rhetoric, nor hyperbole. It has happened, it continues to happen, it will happen, and the result is eventual doublespeak. If you don't believe that it is a problem, then feel free to enjoy it. &gt; Again, projects much larger than Python have been forked because of ideological differences and "words". &gt; I'll continue to point to the ayo fork of nodejs as an example. You mean that dead piece of garbage? Have you even checked it? That fork died before it held water. And that incident was far worse in terms of ideological issues than a bad ideology creeping its way into Python. &gt; Read the thread and you'll know. It's easy to confuse everyone here who compares this change to *1984*, lol. You're not making any sense. This individual change is not compareable to 1984. The ideology of changing vocabulary due to offensiveness, (which is what caused this individual change), is.
I don't know anything about Q so I'm not sure how their arrays are implemented, but in general the word list and the word array are used to mean different things In this you seem to use those words interchangeably, is that intended? Not sure why you left numpy out, it's the canonical array implementation in python really
I’d be curious for the same comparison with NumPy arrays vs Q lists.

The biggest problem see with AR with python on a smartphone is that I haven't seen a good (easy) way to run python apps on a smartphone. This is cool and good guide, but doing it with recorded video isn't *that* interesting. That's more like "augmented video" and not so much "augmented reality".

Scrapers are here to stay, just like speed-dial, microwave ovens, and automatic weapons. Build better websites.
The phrases "fanboy", "shit talk", and "[some group of humans] are just dumb" don't come across as respectful, and wouldn't in just about any known context not exclusively involving teenagers. I've been working in the language for more than a decade, yet I've never come across anyone who says anything like what you're describing. That's likely because you're either oversimplifying their statements or reading too much into their enthusiasm, but either way you come across as either trollish, too easily frustrated, or prone to making too large statements about an IMHO very small subsample of the community. A community that I know quite well, and which isn't obviously any more prone to overstatement of their favorite toy than any of the other language communities out there. Python is my favorite language; thanks to the fact that it's got a great FFI and can relatively easily wrap anything that exports a C ABI, it's proven itself extremely useful in a much wider range of circumstances than it's often given credit for or for which it was truly designed... that means that you don't often come up seriously against it's very real limitations until you either start to try and do embedded or direct memory management work with it, or you start trying to use it in very large, mission critical systems you want to really rely on. No, you don't need to learn a bunch of other languages to have expertise in programming -- though it sure as hell doesn't hurt -- but if you've got less than say 5 years solid professional experience in a wide range of domains with any one language your claims about that language probably shouldn't be taken with more than an iota of salt at any rate. If you're running into people who sound like the fanboys you describe, ignore them... they're not the community I know, they don't speak for the community I know... but the community I do know deserves to be part of a much more measured and constructive conversation than the one your post presents. There's a good reason that old rule about don't say anything at all if you don't have something nice to say exists.
Well done! You will never run out of projects of increasing difficulty. If you continue to work like you're doing you'll be a pretty serious python programmer fairly quickly.
Have you seen the C fan base? If your going to bark up a tree looking for elitism...
You have an un-closed parentheses in the previous line: `weight = int(input("What is your weight in pounds?")` (`int` is never closed). When you get a syntax error with no obvious cause, check the previous few lines.
You are missin closing parenthesis in weight = int(input( line
I didn't post this in /r/learnpython because my question isn't about how to do a specific thing in Python but moreso what way to structure an OO design.
You're missing the closing parentheses when you call the int function. Instead of int(input("message") do int(input("message")). Always account for closing parentheses!

I agree that C does have a lot of fanboys
Thanks for the input. I wasn't sure where to go with Guido stepping down, though I could just say that there is some FUD under future trends. Also I'm not familiar with Python's future roadmap (if there is one), so I'm not aware whether or not 4.0 is close. 
I know, right? the brigading in this forum (and on that github issue/pull request) is insane. &amp;#x200B; Some people really need to reevaluate what's important in their lives.
thanks! i miss those a lot!
&gt; How do I correct it though? Reinstall the OS and use virtual environments this time. IDE suggest pipenv it’s pretty painless to use.
I’m working on an NFC enabled lock for my dorm room. A successful NFC reading leads to the turning of the lock by a servo and includes a manual override button from the inside to let people in. Could use some help with GPIO interrupts if anyone has some input!
What are virtual environments or can you point me in the right direction to learn about them?
That depends on how minimal is minimalist. Me, I use a non-minimal IDE (PyCharm.) * Syntax highlighting * Search/replace with regular expressions.
Virtual environments are containers. It’s a way of isolating the requirements of your projects. Again I would suggest [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for local projects.
oh, this is interesting.
Vim key bindings.
text2art outputs \r\n for me in Xonsh on Linux, did not help to replace with \n's
The output is not correct for me, the newlines are windows newlines or something like that. \r\n. How do I uninstall the program? There is no setup.py uninstall.
Take Clever programmer off. That guy's a dumbass. He's just a fanboy who sucks off Python and doesn't know any other languages. I like Python, but he pisses me off.
Configurable tab width Tabs to spaces Syntax highlighting Everything else is great to have if I can get it but I can function with those three. 
And you should use a user-agent, because if you don't, you're likely to be resource limited very quickly.
Yup. Quite the poor argument. The PSF has a history of supporting diversity. This decision was consistent with what they have done in the past. Also, why would you think Python is a democracy (there was a BDFL, but yet still a dictator)? The leaders of Python can overrule you. Finally, what's really the big deal? It's just documentation.

Isn’t telling people that they don’t understand engineering or that entire teams are incompetent and bad at their jobs an attack? I don’t feel any point to wasting further time on you but for the record, I think a team with a diverse range of interests and life experience is more likely to avoid gaffes and to produce products which a wider range of people love. If you think that’s racist, well, that says a lot about unacknowledged latent bias than anything else.

The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Please no. There's no point making another Nano or Ed. Nobody needs minimal text editors. Sometimes (extremely rarely) your system cannot host a decent editor (Vim or Emacs), that takes about half megabyte of disk space, running the editor takes very little RAM (but it would obviously depend on the task). In this case, you can probably find a way to communicate to it remotely, so that, again, there will be no need for a smaller editor. On the other hand, there's no point in restricting yourself to something like Nano: it just makes your life too miserable. So, you would simply not find any audience willing to use your minimalist editor (for some extremely crazy people, there's Emacs Mini or Vi), but these aren't really programming editors. They are OK-ish, if you need to do something like formatting a commit message or writing a simple Bash script.
Man, I’ll probably get downvotes for this because MS, but I really like VS Code. I guess it’s not consider minimalist, but you can add all of the key binding extensions you want as needed (VIM, EMacs, Atom), and it’s got all the extensions for linting, syntax highlighting etc for whatever language(s) you program in. I like it more than PyCharm tbh, and like it ALOT more than a basic text editor...more downvotes coming from the purists..
vim.basic
That sounds sublime.
Ugh... you may also want to specify that this is not related to linear logic programming. For a moment I though something interesting was being done in Python.
