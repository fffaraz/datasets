&gt;I'd flip that around Everything you said about using 3rd party libraries or custom components can also be done with django &gt; So I'd say Flask is more for the experienced developers who know exactly what they want to use and how to wire it together. I suppose, in a perfect world. In reality most hackeristas I know pick up flask mostly because is the first thing they understand easily. While you see plenty of production real kinda deal sites using django 
If you want performance you're using the wrong language anyway
Relatively speaking I was curious 
Mostly experienced with tektronix instruments but they are super easy to set up and log with pyvisa. I’m sure you could cover most devices with pyvisa and pymodbus.
I'm gonna check this out tonight!
awesome cant wait to hear your feed back! &amp;#x200B;
You hit the nail on the head. I should also add that using just requests along with SSO is a bitch. I never did figure out how to get it to work.
I'm self-taught, and went through a few rounds of interviews. Typically you'll be asked a mix of design questions, like how to "architect some solution", and algorithmic questions. Algorithmic questions are generally fairly standard: there are 100's of blogs and websites that teach you how to solve these. You don't need to know them all, but you need to know the general approach. As the other comment said, you WILL be asked about big(O) / space / time complexity; luckily for me, no one really cares that much about the answer. But you have to have some ideas about how shitty your solution is, and how to improve it. Being self-taught, having lots of personal projects in Github, and lots of passion for coding, are going to be your two main selling points. You can easily demonstrate passion (by virtue of being self-taught it's pretty much a given) but good projects will really set you apart. And remember: even great coders fail lots of interviews; there are many other skills than pure coding that make someone an attractive candidate.
No need for Visa or IVI! You can use tcpip directly. I send SCPI messages with ip, using port 5025 on a Rohde&amp;Schwarz spectrum analyzer. Works great! 
SQLite for sure. No need for a separate server process!
Thanks! I look into that as well. 
Designing an app to upload my high school grades to a matplotlib graph an send an email over SMTP about my grades, if they went up, if they went down. I have done this once before but i'm adding to it and I'm uploading it to my AP Computer Science class and I personally feel like it's going to be the most useful project
You should invest in refactoring a lot! Get rid of all those globals first. Ask yourself: why do I need this information? How can it be provided as parameter? Can I group some or all of those variables into one data structure? Then try to see code duplications. I have only skimmed through your code, but saw lots of very similar menu implementations. Better write one, that you could reuse by passing a fitting menu data structure into it. I think there is much more, but just start with those items and you will make your code much better and learn a lot. As an advanced topic ask yourself, why there are differences between a human controlled player and npcs? Or to be more precise: what are the differences? Can you reuse one class to represent both? (and yes you can an probably should) in order to manage this, you will learn about *composition* and that it is often the far better approach to inheritance. This could lead you to your first *design pattern*: strategy. Good luck further more. 
Sometimes you will get lucky, and the data you need is already in an easily readable JSON format. Sometimes the site just appends HTML. It really varies a lot. 
Handwritten, information is filled in like a form
Check out seaborn... maybe.
I second that! "Automate the Boring Stuff" is a wonderful and easy to understand starting point to get into python, skipping all the boring stuff and get right into the really badass things python can do!

Try pytesseract. It may struggle with hand written text though [https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) &amp;#x200B;
You certainly not could go this route. However you could also stay with Labview and go with C++. Last I knew Labview and the required hardware was expensive so maybe not a good choice. It really comes down to how many instruments, how much data and the complexity of the setup. By complexity I mean a number of things but the amount of processing and the type of processing are big factors. If you are doing signal processing that Labview supports out of the box it could be foolish to roll your own in Python. On the other hand having full access to your PC via C++ and the heavy type support there can be a long term benefit. In a nut shell there is no straight answer here! One would really need a full understanding of what Labview is doing along with the C# code. Python could certainly do in some instances but the question in my mind is it a significant improvement over what you have in C# and Labview. Frankly that depends upon the environment and what you are doing. Someone mentioned in a previous respond collecting the data directly from the instrument avoiding PyVISA altogether. This is certainly doable and maybe even advisable in simple installations. You really need to read the manuals because an instrument may often support more than one communications protocol. For example ample back in the day one TC thermometer we used could be set up to stream out the measurement data all on its own, no queries required. Also realize that there are alternatives to Labview if you need supported software that talks to more “industrial” like devices. A project I worked on years ago for example used KEPServer to get data off a process controller. There are many similar servers available that can make it incredibly easy to read data via MicroSoft supported languages. It would pay to check and see what the spectrum analyzer manufacture has too. The problem here is that these servers don’t always make your solution simpler, however they can save lots of screwing around with communications programming. In any event the point here is that you have lots of options. Some of these options have the potential to simplify life for you. If you want to run a simple script from the command line Python might be the right choice. If you want a ice Windows app something different than Python might be in order. 
you are right i have a lot of duplication on the menus! I will be doing a lot of thinking on what you have said! Thanks for the awesome advice!! 
Sweet!! If you need assistance this subredit is a great recourse and the people here are very helpful! Let me know if you need any help and I'll see if I can do anything for you :)
Is this a serious bit of code or a junk app. If it is serious code then frankly your question is foolish and smacks of being uninformed . If it is a junk apps I really cares. In either case you have a choice to make. Either do a Python 3.x version of switch to another language. It is up to you to make that decision. 
&gt; The main reason why people like VIM is modal editing. And you can use VIM-like modal editing in pretty much any IDE. So modal editing isn't really an argument vor VIM the program, but for VIM-like keybindings. There are many reasons to prefer vim other than just the fact that it's modal. One thing about IDEs is that they tend to only work well for a few languages, and not all all or very poorly for others. Vim works well for virtually all text, and adding basic support for new languages is easy (and the community has created support for virtually any language you can think of). Another thing is that for straight editing, vim has *far* better performance than most IDEs. I use the Jetbrains IDEs for some languages (mostly Kotlin) on a pretty beefy machine, and it's very noticeably slower than vim. I have a keybinding set up in my IDE to open the current file in vim with my cursor at the same spot, because frequently I need to do a bunch of hairy editing, and [the IDE would just be too slow](https://i.imgur.com/nGO32Wq.gifv). That said, I still use the IDE part of the time because of the refactoring and navigation tools. IdeaVIM is useful to me not just because it's modal, but because it means that when I switch back and forth between vim and the IDE, I can still use (mostly) the same keybindings. tl;dr: complaints that these plugins don't exactly match vim are valid, because I'm not going to have to just get used to the differences one time -- I'm switching between the two on an ongoing basis.
For OCR, especially handrwritten, I found it easiest to just use [Google Cloud Vision Service](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/handwriting). You don't have to train your own AI, it works pretty well out of the box and the API is very straight forward. If you have the text, it should be manageable to get the text you want. For reference: I wrote a small [Telegram Bot](https://git.sr.ht/~jshsj/telegram_bot_ocr) around it and it works pretty well.
Yes I would recommend you learn following things: 1. Python Requests: Plain and simple, very handy when to do simple tasks related to an HTTP request, you will learn more of it as you progress. 2. Beautiful Soup: Simple but effective module, used to parse the HTML webpages. You will find it super cool. 3. Selenium: Its what you want, the automation, it actually automates the stuff, initially prepared for testing but you know people can make different uses of a thing. 4. Scrapy: Last but not the least scrapy, it collects the data from the sites, its general other components above are used when it failed to be used, its most easy to use, much efficient, cleaner code, bla bla bla. So keep goin man. May you earn some money by learning these things, may be as a freelance, I am saying this because, I earned about 100 Euro for 1 day work of scraping some data, and I used Scrapy, and at one part Selenium+Requests+Beautiful Soup . 🔥
Is it worth updating from Windows XP? Maybe it still does exactly what you want it to do. But there's no longer security or other updates for XP. As time goes on, it's harder and harder to update software or find new software for XP. Same thing for python 2. Once it's eol, there are no more updates. Maybe your dependencies still work now, and maybe they'll continue to work. But at some point, it won't be practical. Upgrading lets you take advantage of new features and updates. It's up to you, but it's encouraged 
BTW it is possible to develop a Python bot without using Twitter API, I have done so in the past and still have the code for it. The reason for not using the API is stealth, Twitter can easily ban your API key if you are abusing it. All you need is 1. Python 3.6, 2. Selenium, 3. Chrome And web development knowledge ie: div tag names, id, xpath etc. Keep in mind the stealth bot will last as long as Twitter not making changes to their core design CSS or Div names, otherwise it will crash. In my opinion this may work for 6 months, and constant tweaking is required.
Go with SQLite. It’s a mature, battle tested dbms. It provides you with easy portability of the database (since it’s a file) and removes the need for operating A client/server dbms.
Looking at it now, thanks!
&gt; One thing lambda does that a def doesn't is allow definition to happen with some of the variables being out of scope. A def produces an a not defined error. Doesn't make it right however. you could definitely do that, just define function inside function like this. def outerfunc(): a = 1 def innerfunc(): print(a) return a + 3 b = innerfunc() print(b) &amp;#x200B;
Where I can find challenges on Github for beginners? Thanks
I can't wait to try it out!! &amp;#x200B;
All the interviews I have had ask: Explain the GIL What are the differences between lists, dicts, tuples, etc. What are the advantages of python 3.x over 2.x Explain list, dict comprehension Do you understand lambda, map, filter, reduce Some question that was asking about the yield keyword Then a load of questions specific to Django (I'm a django dev.) Such as: Explain the Django request cycle What are the 3 methods for middleware? how would you optimise a query Generally, show knowledge of the framework, the language in general, and a bit about programming complexity. i.e. avoiding loops. Also, show that you can write tests. Good tests. Build a portfolio. This might be tricky, but find a subject you're passionate about and create a project. Store it in github. Being able to link to your own work and say 'I made this' can be very beneficial.
Understand that. My point was you can do this: ```python def outerfunc(): innerfunc = lambda : a+3 a = 1 b = innerfunc() print(b) ``` You can reference `a` prior to it being defined. 
It can be easily done with Selenium, Python, and Chrome. Get part number from a CSV file one at time Input into search field and hit search Get the results from web page and write it into another CSV file such as price, part number But keep in mind this type of automation if done incorrectly can cause a small scale DOS attack on the server, it can slow it down dramatically if the bot is too aggressive. Therefore search in loops of 5-10 per session, put time.sleep in between, and randomize the sleep time so not to overload the server. For any web admins here looking to protect your servers from bots for free. Check out http://www.botdetector.ca/code.php
I appreciate that! I have A LOT to wrap my head around before I'll be ready to ask questions, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. :)
A good first effort! It can be intimidating writing something that seems so humble compared to commercial games, but text adventures in qbasic were how I got started too! You might want to create a stable and development branch with git if you are going to share it. Tried to run it and I think you've made some modifications.
The OCRs everyone is talking about here is not a 100% reliable, you will encounter mistakes, the best results I personally got from reading a black and white PDF using these OCRs will result in maybe 70-75% accuracy, they tend to convert everything to gray scale first and if there are multiple colors involved I wouldn't count on that option yet.
I can see you're picking up OO principles well. I can highly recommend Steven F. Lott's Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design. I taught me a lot about how classes should interact with each other without the need of any globals. The author tells you what attributes and methods each class should have but you have to figure out the code. And the tests!!
Thanks! I'd like to eventually package this into something other employees could use, but small steps for now haha 
Thanks for your reply! Id love to one day get a job doing this but it's really early days for me haha. I just wanna find some projects to reinforce the theory I've learnt so far, and try to make it actually useful and relative! 
It seems to be twice as fast, especially when no rescale is being done. At 100x100 image resize it seems to be 1.2-1.5 faster than np, so because it is significantly faster I revised my gist and added a comment crediting you for telling me :)
Whatever you do, don't fall for the Udemy Scam. Recommend: www.pythonprogramming.net
choice is an int. You're comparing it to a string. So choice is neither equal to "1" nor "2" so a will not be assigned.
I don't know of a cute way to do it, but if you can attach a GDB debugger to the process, you can catch it: ``` $ gdb --args bash Reading symbols from bash...(no debugging symbols found)...done. (gdb) run Starting program: /bin/bash [20:06:07 u1804!1 ~] ```` Now send a SIGHUP to the bash interpreter from another terminal and you'll see GDB grabs control again... ```` Program received signal SIGHUP, Hangup. 0x00007ffff76cd0e9 in __pselect (nfds=1, readfds=0x7fffffffd440, writefds=0x0, exceptfds=0x0, timeout=&lt;optimized out&gt;, sigmask=0x7fffffffd3c0) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/pselect.c:69 69 ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/pselect.c: No such file or directory. ```` At the prompt, you can examine `$_siginfo._sifields` to see which PID sent the signal (if the signal was sent by a userland process at all!): ``` (gdb) print $_siginfo._sifields $1 = { _pad = {11104, 1000, 0 &lt;repeats 26 times&gt;}, _kill = { si_pid = 11104, si_uid = 1000 }, ```` If this case it was PID 11104, which corresponds to the PID of the bash process running in my second terminal (which you can see by typing 'echo $$' in that terminal)
&gt;Without that Python would be much faster in terms of parallel computing. and much more slower running scripts on single core
It depends on what you're doing with the code. If you're using it for an internal company tool, then you can "fork" it - change the name and license and keep it private to your company. ([see this FAQ answer](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic)) But if we're talking about an app that you're distributing to customers, then you need to make your changes available to your users under the GPLv3.
so should it just be if choice == 1: instead of if choice == "1": ? 
Another alternative rarely called to mind: First, try to check if your site is not taken in account on this site: [http://weboob.org/applications/](http://weboob.org/applications/) You can reuse their libraries If it's not already done, you can create your own module or simply extend their framework for your needs: [http://dev.weboob.org/guides/module.html](http://dev.weboob.org/guides/module.html) 
cant wait to hear what you think!
Thank you, i will do that.
There are many databases, pick one, check if Django driver is available and use it. SQLite can be a good choice, however it can be hard to scale your app (if you need to), because sqlite does not support multiprocess writing. If you need a thing for your local db for single application instance - it is pretty good choice. If you need more features, i'd like to suggest postgresql, just because Django was built to use this db originally.
Man that is a very good idea! Thanks for the Idea!!! &amp;#x200B;
Ok thanks! As you can see with the global variables everywhere my noob is showing. I will be revising the code to not have them soon! I will most deffantly be looking into this Steven F.! Thanks for the kind words!!!!
Hell yeah! Pycharm FTW. &amp;#x200B;
Would you happen to know a way to bypass websites that use Cloudflare + Captchas, I always encounter this issue when using BS4.
Yes
I once spent some time modifying a Pokemon Go mapping application to use Google Protocol Buffers as the data transport between the server and the browser because the JSON payload was rather large and I was concerned about bandwidth usage. After several hours of implementing my solution, I deployed the update to my personal server. It was only then that I realized that my server was using gzip compression for the JSON payload and my development environment was not. The compression resulted in a negligible, but observable improvement in payload size for JSON over the Protobuf solution. I don't consider it wasted time because I learned about using Protobufs in python whereas my only previous experience was in Ruby. I still benefited from the process!
There are a few ways you could do this. First if you have read access to the database for the website you could just run a query on it and get your information. If you have to read it from the web pages directly (because you cannot directly access the DB), that will be a little harder but not much. Scrapy and selenium (if the website uses JS, which it probably does) will help. Just look for tutorial videos and pages and you'll be set.
A couple of things: One is that /r/learnpython is a better place to ask these kinds of questions. The other is that you can preserve formatting in markdown using triple backticks: ``` print('this character: ') for _ in range(3): print('`') ```

Exactly! Heavy ambiguity in this post. By the way if the universities material is copyrighted they may not be all that pleased with putting the content online. 
I'll bare that in mind and probably end up checking for similarities between what was found and what I expect to find.
Thanks I will go over this weekend with a highlighter :) but that answers my question! I didn’t see anything relating to ‘changing license’ like you said though. Only that they don’t have to distribute. I don’t think you can change license of GPLv3 isn’t that the point?
In an effort to learn the intricacies and nuances of Python, I’m running through all of codingbat.com ‘s Python stuff and playing code golf. I’ve got everything I’ve completed so far down to one line (or two if you count ; as line breaks) and I’ve learned a lot about Booleans and generators and ternary operators and the like. 
Yea, I'm not actually sure, I guess I was thinking more "remove and document" (so employees know where the code came from and to keep it private) than "change" but I wasn't very clear :) I'm not a lawyer and all that good stuff, so, probably worth checking with one if you have questions
Sorry, and thanks.
I just wanted to say thank you for this comment! I have been siting here asking my self how to get ride of the global variables and what they have in common. I can make a coordinates class and put all my x y stuff in there. I know i have just scratch the cervices of this topic but I wouldn't have thought about it or even considered classes without you pushing me in the direction. If this is not the right solution well i guess i am just looking foolish at the moment.
Awesome typo.... beautiful soul
That would be challenging. Interacting with a game is almost impossible without doing image recognition and ai/neural networks.
This is what I was hoping the single comment was going to be.
Ahhh whoopsie! I fixed it :)
Or if you can teach whoever is doing the schedule how to properly use Open Office or Excel spreadsheet and email to everyone instead of stone age of printing and taking photos, you can accurately narrow down your hours with ease using Python build in CSV function.
If you can do it-ish in Excel, you can do it in Python better.
Just bought it. Do you have any background in financial analysis and would you recommend any for the course?
Try a book like "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python" [https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544823312&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Automating+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544823312&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Automating+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python) Or "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" [https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr\_1\_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544823312&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Automating+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544823312&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Automating+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python) Both books are excellent ways to start. I use Python to make small specific apps and to process data. &amp;#x200B;
To be honest I see this question a lot. The answer is pretty simple: start anywhere. Just start doing it, reading the docs, being creative and expressive your ideas in code. A 'decent' understanding is also pretty vague in my opinion. I have been coding in python for quite a while now, and I still see cool stuff every day that other people come up with. The most important part is to just have fun and start coding!
Start at r/learnpython
No, my background is in software development. This is my first dive into financial analysis and algorithmic trading.
I’ll second selenium and pandas for this. You could collect the data on a pandas data frame and export it to a excel file when the work is complete. I do a remarkably similar task at my work place that involves logging into a permit system and reviewing individual permits.
Just a heads up. https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/
Care to explain why? I'm curious.
I found selenium a lot easier to troubleshoot and work with than requests personally.
Really? I work as a municipal engineer and feel like I know selenium pretty well. Any good resources for small side jobs?
Looks like you have some good answers for tools. I’ll add that I’m pretty fond of Treehouse ($25 a month), but there are plenty of free resources - you can definitely learn it for free. I’m chiming in to say that your first project should be something you come up with - think of a problem you’d like to solve or something cool you’d like to do and go for it, even if solutions already exist. You’ll want to start small for sure, but no worries if your first ideas are too big - think the project through before actually starting, and you should have a rough idea of whether or not you can do it. You get better at it with practice, so don’t get discouraged!! I use Python a lot because I just like it the most - to me, it’s extremely readable and easy to write. I’ll use other languages when needed or required to, but I default to Python until I have a good reason not to use it.
Yup, that's normal. You're used to using a browser.
What other languages do you know? And how long did it take you to learn each language?
Normally you have api calls that you can do if the game developers have foreseen this option. Using the request package you could interact with these apis. So check if that is available for your game. If not it probably ends here. Having software play for you requires AI development (deep learning) 
Will check it out. Thank you!
Thank you for the tutorial. I have one question left regarding Anaconda though. How would you set it up using Anaconda? Or would you rather choose something else? Thing is I'm going to work on a project using [scrapy.](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html) And the recommended way to use it is through Anaconda. I'm not an expert to figure out why that is, but I can tell from attempts that Anaconda was the only way to run my project without issue. Do you know Anaconda? It seems outdated. I wonder if there is something more up to date that might be a better solution. Is it possible to install more than one environment in VS Code? Cheers

I'm currently using SQLalchemy and PyQt5 for my finals project. SQLalchemy is though to get into but once your in it's great and PyQt has been great all around except for the MVC stuff As for learning: SQLalchemy doesn't have that many resources, YouTube and the docs are the way to Go. For PyQt you'll often consult the C++ docs. If you're interested in an example I can link you the current version of my finals project which among other things is an inventory system which might be kinda what you want to do :D
Maybe draw and share mockups do it is easier to understand. Also look for Python web framework and compare the top ones to decide which one to use ;)
*cough* ` Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner] ` in your license file. :)
Thanks for the help. I would definitely appreciate if you could link me your project. 
That is a good idea. I need to follow-up once I can get better in understanding what actually I need. 
https://github.com/SV-97/TUInventory there you go ;) the code itself is mostly documented in english, in documentation is is a tex file but that's in German. The classes file covers most of the SQLalchemy stuff and ui is pyqt though that Code is kinda whack as a buddy of Mine that also is on the project wrote his styling stuff into it.
You can’t markdown images on Reddit but you can still link it. However this looks really interesting going to check it out.

This question is better suited for /r/learnprogramming 
How are they different? I use headless chrome (or headless firefox, or phantomJS back in the day) with selenium for my automated scraping jobs.
Well it mostly have to do with QA so if you're interested to become a QA engineer that's one direction you might consider.
&gt; cervices The word you're looking for was "surface", just in case English isnt your first language. :) Also, great job!
OK. Thanks

This installs the packages to a single global python environment, targeting a single version of python. If you fuck up that environment, you're boned, because your OS probably relies on it for some system-level stuff. If you need to switch between python environments for different projects (e.g. if they have conflicting requirements), or to check for compatibility within the same project, you can't. If you're running tests against a project, are they passing because the code and installation procedure is correct, or because you have some other junk installed which you may not be passing on to your downstream users? You may also need root privileges to install packages this way, which it's best to avoid if possible. For some package managers, you can also be stuck on old versions of python. Instead, use one of a few solutions to isolate your python environments. The most common is `virtualenv`, but if you're only using recent versions of python 3, you can use the built-in `venv` instead. There is also `conda` if you're installing a lot of compiled packages too. I, personally, use `pyenv` to install any version of python I want with a single command, create environments as and when I want them, and even automatically switch to the correct python environment whenever I `cd` into one of my projects. If you're testing code across all supported versions of python, you need 4 separate, self-contained environments. I use `tox` to manage that kind of thing; it's incredibly useful. On top of my tox environments, I will usually have one or two dev environments per project. If one of my environments gets messed up for whatever reason, I can toss it and create a fresh one with as few as 3 commands, rather than having to reinstall the OS as I did when I messed up my system python, upon which `apt` relies.
Use slices e.g. for i in range(len(txt) - 2): if txt\[i:i+2\] not in letters\_dictionary: letters\_dictionary\[tx\[i:i+2\]\] = 0 etc.
With captchas you can pay a captcha solving service. 
Yep! I fixed it haha. 
My last job was to literally do this. I built python apps that used pyvisa to automate scopes, VNAs, and more, did data processing, and threw it up on a gui in wx or qt. Pyvisa is pretty straightforward for most things. Go crazy.

Who knows? Maybe it's a case of "if it ain't broke don't fix it". Maybe it's a case of you have to update to Python 3 as you need long term support. That's something only you can tell us.
Hey man welcome back from Mars
Skip the other parts and use beautifulsoup. 
Just like /u/slakerjak said, you will need to use a literal video feed from your computer screen to take the inputs of the chess board (the same way your eyes do) and use a machine learning algorithm to determine what is the next best move (the same way your brain makes that decision). Making the move itself in the program should be pretty simple as Selenium has a Python API that you can use to interact with web applications. With that framework you should be able to send any clicks or keys you need to input into the game.
You'd be better served over at /r/learnpython
The only thing worse is automating mouse clicks.
Looks nice. It might be useful for me in the future. From a superficial scan, I can only recommend integrating with tqdm in some way, and making sure everything works on jupyter notebooks (shouldn't be hard). Also, new processes might need an init function, like `multiprocessing` provides. Providing a callback is a given, but maybe you can create a nicer interface with inheritance / class decorators.
And if you don't want the whole thing, the [parsel component](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) is equivalent to BeautifulSoup (actually better, IMO). You can freely mix and match XPath and CSS selectors to identify the content you need. Combine that with requests for quick HTML parsing: html = parsel.Selector(text=requests.get("https://google.com").text) html.css(".class a::attr(href)").extract_all()
You can use “or” If a = 1 or A= 1 : Example 
Don't worry man your doing better than me. Jus put off curiosity is coding the same as English for dyslexia or is it easier? The game looks really cool. 
It probably is. If you don't need heavy concurrent access, sqlite.
Python on Windows hasn't been installed at the top level of a disk for years so the only way that it can get there is if the user deliberately puts it there, assuming that's an option. System wide installs go in C:\\Program Files, user installs under the user's appdata folder.
I think its just with spelling for me. I do very well im math and with my music theory and coding reminds me a lot of my music theory in a way. Short answer, i dont think it bothers me.
Huh thats really cool I'm not dyslexic but I struggle with spelling and excel at maths. 
It says "fighing" 
Good shit man!! 
Look into selenium. I automated downloading statements from online banking sites with it.
It looks nice, but I'd be worried to use something as easy to mess up as parallel code that has no unit tests in the repo.
Quick skimming and some things that jump out: You can import multiple things from a module at once. So all the 'from script import x' lines could be condensed into a single: from script import InfoDics, Items, Map, Mobs, NPC, Screen, Story There's almost never a good reason to use a global. Many of what you're defined already exists or could exist as a 'Player' object attribute. Consider using tuples for things like coordinates. If you're always going to use values together like that, it's what those types of containers are specifically designed for. So 'x' and 'y' could be packed into a 'coords = ( 5, 0 )'...and then added to an appropriate object instead of being in the global pool. Look into using dictionaries for all of your data that follows a strong 'name' = 'value' pairing. For example: map_sizes = { 'small' : 100, 'medium' : 500, 'large' : 10000 } I'd move the Player class and other related classes off into their own script. Keep [main.py](https://main.py) as lean and uncluttered as possible. All of your player class classes ( Mage, Archer, etc ) could probably be subclassed from a more abstract Player\_Class that holds attributes for shared data. char\_creation could be moved into it's own script as well, it's not really part of the main loop don't instantiate 'PlayerInventory' in the global scope, do it in the \_\_init\_\_of your 'Player' class: self.inventory = PlayerInventory( ) &amp;#x200B; A lot of sub-functions under char\_creation. You should really consider just making this a sub-module. As a general rule, you rarely want to define a function inside of a function, that way they can be used elsewhere Most of these would probably work better if you passed the 'Player' object int as an arguement, allowing you to update the object attributes as needed: player = Player( ) def name_player( player ): input_name = input("\n\nENTER YOUR NAME:&gt; ") player.name = input_name def player_gender( player ): input_gender = input('\n\n(1): Male\n(2): Female\nEnter A Number:&gt; ') if input_gender == 1: player.gender = 'male' ... Think about Class abstraction and inheritance. I'm seeing a lot of classes defined that all share many attributes and you've started to use abstraction and inheritance in your [Mobs.py](https://Mobs.py). But could that be extended further? Whats the same between enemy 'mobs' and the 'player'? Is there a 'character' base class that could hold a lot of this similiar data? class Character(): # base attributes for all characters in the game class Player( Character ): # base attributes plus stuff unique for the player character class NPC( Character ): # base stats plus extra things that the player doesn't need class Enemy( Character ): # More specific things for NPCs that you have to fight class Undead( Enemy ): # even more specific things for all 'undead' type enemies. Strengths, weaknesses, etc class Zombie( Undead ): # very specific things for all 'zombie' enemies Lots of big blocks of text assembled using seperate lines that look really difficult to manage. Why not use triple quotes and .format in a loop: str_screen = """ [line] #- [header] -# #- -# #- ([num1]): [start] -# #- ([num2]): [load] -# #- ([num3]): [help_] -# #- ([num4]): [change_log] -# #- ([num5]): [quit] -# #- -# #- [l1] -# #- [l2] -# #- [l3] -# [line] """ replace = { 'line' : cyan + '#' * 64, 'header' : light_red + 'WELECOME TO THE WASTE LAND' + cyan, 'num1' : green + '1' + cyan, 'num2' : green + '2' + cyan, 'num3' : green + '3' + cyan, 'num4' : green + '4' + cyan, 'num5' : green + '5' + cyan, 'start' : yellow + 'START' + cyan, 'load' : yellow + 'LOAD' + cyan, 'help_' : yellow + 'HELP' + cyan, 'change_log' : yellow + 'CHANGE LOG' + cyan, 'quit' : yellow + 'QUIT' + cyan, 'l1' : red + "SELECT A NUMBER TO CONTINE" + cyan, 'l2' : red + "Copy Write 2018" + cyan, 'l3' : red + "Writen by Cowboy Gaming" + cyan, } for key, value in formatters.items( ): str_screen = str_screen.replace( '[{}]'.format( key ), value ) print( str_screen ) I think you'd be better served coming up with a more abstract, general use block of text formatter that's driven by the data you want to show. &amp;#x200B; About all I have time to look at right now.
I can't recommend this any more: https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
&gt;I can make a coordinates class and put all my x y stuff in there. Maybe. But are coordinates associated with an already existing object like 'player' or 'map'? 
https://prometheus.io/
http://robotframework.org makes this really easy (keyword driven) with little programming needed, just config files. It uses Python and Selenium under the hood, so you can write code if you want.
oh maybe i need to put the x and y in the player class..... mmmm
No, update it to assembly instead.
oops thanks! i will fix that! &amp;#x200B;
Thanks!!!!!!
I rewrote a python library for newsapi for my own personal use. I uploaded it on pypi for others to use as well, [you can see more on the repo](https://github.com/KirtusJ/newsapi-scraper). 
You are using uncontrolled recursion to loop which isn't a good idea. This means: * you have a memory leak, * after a number of moves your game will raise an RecursionError exception. You use recursion to loop everywhere, but it's most simply seen in the `main()`function: def main(): Screen.main_menu_screen() choice = input('\n\nSELECT A NUMBER:&gt; ') if choice == '1': char_creation() elif choice == '2': print('NOT AN OPTION YET') ##-- LOADED AND SAVE --## time.sleep(2) main() # recursive call which never returns ... You should be using actual loops, something like this: def main(): while True: Screen.main_menu_screen() choice = input('\n\nSELECT A NUMBER:&gt; ') if choice == '1': char_creation() elif choice == '2': print('NOT AN OPTION YET') ##-- LOADED AND SAVE --## time.sleep(2) ... 
Man oh man! Thank you for the advice!! Im going to stop trying to add things and just work on fixing the code up to be cleaner! Thank you thanks you thank you for taking the time to explain in such detail how i can better my project! I have learned a lot from you! I'm so exited to implement these things! God bless ya!
Post to /r/DYI this is great stuff. I might prefer a more diffuse lighting scheme, but I love it.
Awesome project :) !
oh crap! I didn't know that was bad practice. I do that in all my code. Thanks for the warning! I need to fix a lot of stuff it seems! its a bit over whelming. lol &amp;#x200B;
Anyway to integrate what you did with lidarr? Lidarr is lacking, if it had the ability to import spotify playlists it would be killer.
I'm sorry! Check the addition I added to the bottom of my comment.
Hot take: `x` and `y` should only exist in the key, not in the actual object.
Noted and fixed; thanks. 
`str.format_map` can take an object with custom `__getitem__` FYI. But chances are `str.format` is enough.
I’ve never seen tdqm, looks neat and a worthwhile addition; thanks. I’ll look into the init function too; thanks for giving it a look-over. 
Its all good man I really really really do appreciate the pointers! It was something i didn't know about and I'm very happy to see the solution isn't hard. I just have to stay focused and take one problem at a time. Thanks for the words of encouragement. That was also very kind of you! God bless ya man!!
i don't understand what you mean by key.
I considered adding unit tests before releasing, but I’ve been at this project for months and was eager to get it out. Unit testing is the appropriate next step in this learning project. I appreciate the feedback.
&gt;.Class methods are almost always pointless This I disagree with. If you want an alternative initialiser for a class, then @classmethod is the way to go. `datetime` uses it a lot to allow multiple ways of creating datetime objects.
Is scrapy better than selenium for automation ?
Apologies, I was not aware. Thanks for the heads-up.
Looks awesome, dig the screen shots! &amp;#x200B; Those calls to main aren't good practice! Put this in a loop! &amp;#x200B; `def main():` `Screen.main_menu_screen()` `choice = input('\n\nSELECT A NUMBER:&gt; ')` `if choice == '1':` `char_creation()` `elif choice == '2':` `print('NOT AN OPTION YET') ##-- LOADED AND SAVE --##` `time.sleep(2)` `main()` `elif choice == '3':` `print('NOT AN OPTION YET') ##-- Help --##` `time.sleep(2)` `main()` `elif choice == '4':` `ChangeLog.change_log_print()` `pause()` `main()`
Yes... Gmail 
Sweet! What module did you use to create the topic landscape?
I have used it to send 15 emails and it work perfectly. 
Dude, that looks swell. Any chance of sharing the actual implementation?
Noted! Thank you!
Python's saturated. You might find something, but will have a far easier time with a newer language like Rust or Go.
I was thinking about doing this just the other day as a way to practice, nice to see I'm not alone!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe that you can track the activity of your browser using Python. Consider creating a browser extension with JavaScript. You can use Python for the backend part though. [This](https://github.com/Thibauth/browsing-activity-tracker) may be something that you're looking for. 
The regex search is completely unnecessary; it is turning the algorithm into n^2 when it can just be directly linear. Just iterate the pairs directly into `Counter`. For maximum efficiency, use the `pairwise` [itertools recipe](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes): Counter(map(''.join, pairwise('abababcbcbcbasdfeee'))) 
Thank you for sharing your code with me. I know you can use csv. I have my email list in an excel file. 
Its dang good practice and fun!
The csv module is really handy, especially Dictreader. Excel can export to csv, so it should be no problem!
key/value are terms used for `dict` and similar. I haven't looked at your code, but chances are you have something like: objects_on_map = {} objects_on_map[0, 0] = Creature(x=0, y=0, ...) Here, `0, 0` is the key (remember that tuples don't need parentheses) and `Creature(...)` is the value. It's possible to avoid the duplication of the x and y, which means they'll never go out of sync, and you don't have to worry about the "deleted" state. That said, many people find this too painful to do, since then when you *do* need to know the creature's position, you have to pass it around separately. But

You could always just make them in a package and make it searchable along your PATH or PYTHONPATH. Then just “from package.module import class/func/obj”. Or install it with pip to your site-packages. 
Start with a virtualenv https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html Share the same venv between your two projects. Call your two projects: application and library. Library provides some encapsulated service to the application (networking, business logic, etc). For library, follow the documentation below to make a setup.py file and then "install" it to the shared venv with the `develop` flag. https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode From there application can then `import your_library` and use it as a dependency. 
How to make python packages: https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-create-a-python-package/ 
Use pip, save yourself a lot of trouble and use venv/pip.
That makes a lot of sense, thank you for explaining that to me!
No prob. Makes sense.
Oh right, cause you are incrementing i within second loop, making first one just do nothing and run only once
It’s not Python, but I prefer puppeteer for this. It’s a headless and testable JavaScript package. It won’t be as fast but it will be *much* more thorough
A) datetime predates the concept of Pythonicness and has a terrible API in general. B) I agree that alternative constructors are a valid use of class methods but C) you can also just use keyword arguments and cover 80% of all use cases. 
Hi, I am curious about this approach. Could you share sample code? I have been using pyVISA on a 32 bit interpreter all this while and have missed out on using libraries that dont support 32 bit, ex. fdb.

About how long did this take you?
Altogether 5 days. But I haven't got to code straight so its been a months since Ive started.
Well that ain’t very long. Maybe I’m just a shit programmer XD
This is amazing. Thanks!
Yes for some easy and basic project, options are endless, combine scrapping with machine learning, make redding sentiment analysis.
I've had to learn Python at work rather recently (I never picked up programming prior to this), now I'm finding Python quite enjoyable as a creative endeavor. Right now I'm working my way through Django's tutorials and documentation; I have a website idea that's been itching my brain for years now.
That's what I said before I read [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) 
Go for it! Once you get your head around it, everything starts to make a lot more sense. As said, automate the boring stuff is highly recommended. I only scanned through it so I can't say I know it myself. I learnt a lot of my knowledge from YouTube. I read most of *Python Crash Course* as well which I liked, but I can't compare it to similar books. There are a range of YouTubers that have quality, free tutorials that you should be able to [find.](https://find.It) Looking at other people's code helped me a lot to put together key concepts, so once you're on your feet maybe you should think about that.
&gt;RPG game *twitch*
Dont think that way. Everyone has there own pace. I wouldn't worry about it. I did a lot of bad things while coding it and im paying the price. Should have taken a little more time.
12.5 months, actually! 
If you’re concerned with browser-specific testing where you’re executing user actions (QA), Selenium is better. Headless Chrome is nice for standalone services because, I believe, it focuses less on testing/browser compatibility and more on speed. Wish I had more of a technical response with stats. Personally, I’ve migrated a Selenium Firefox crawling service to headless Chromium and saw a HUGE performance increase. What would normally take 30-45 seconds for Selenium Firefox ended up taking about 5 seconds for headless Chromium.
Looks quite pretty! Which package/tool did u use for visualization?

I agree. I've been coding since February, and took a long detour into data science. I started itching to build things, and started making a kind of social media clone, just for fun an implementing the pieces, and seeing how it might work. It's been really fun an rewarding, I highly recommend picking something like this to build. I'm almost finished implementing, then I will work on refactoring. You can learn a lot in a project like this, from design, implementation, code clean up, etc. I really hope I can think of another fun larger project like this when I'm finished

No problem! I improved the documentation a little bit so it's easier now to see what you can do with it. 
Hi, I am very interested in this - but am a beginner. Do you have any resource you can share to learn more about how P2P sharing works? Thanks in advance and sorry if the question is too broad. 
conda simply doesn't install packages unless you tell it to (or it is required by something you tell it to) and I think that's a good behavior. Just make sure you tell it what you want. conda create -n myenvironment python=3.6 pandas scikit-learn jupyter etc.
There's a Talk Python episode with a guy from Netflix where he talks a lot about Jupyter Notebooks, if anyone is interested in learning more. 
If you truly want "everything", you can do conda create -n myenvironment python=3.6 anaconda

This is brilliant. I would love to learn more about how this is done. Could you share your code or provide a few pointers please?
You could use python but I would think about future maintainability. If you intend to progress in your career and move into designing solutions instead of building them. I would recommend: 1. Implementing a database 2. Using python for your ETL and/or streamline your feeds 3. Use a data visualization software to abstract away the hard work If you want them to solely on you. Keep it in VBA or move it all into python

There are few sites/repos that list open source contribution opportunities for new contributors like [up-for-grabs.net](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/). Those are lists of open source projects with easy-to-medium issues that new contributors can work on. Regardless of your actual programming skills, if you never made a pull request / solved an issue / forked a repo / etc you should pick one (or more) really easy issue from any of the repo listed on those site to just get familiar with git and with the contribution workflow.

Just to understand you: So you want to completely switch from Managerial background to full Development, and apparently you have no CS background? 
What is it?
'cool'
If you do not actively develop, it is more important to understand the fundamental principles of software. For example how does the client communicate with a webserver? How do you secure the connection ? How do you handle concurrent updates? Programming is just the execution of these principles.
And yet without Cambridge Analytica tying them together...

&gt; This installs the packages to a single global python environment, targeting a single version of python. If you fuck up that environment, you're boned, because your OS probably relies on it for some system-level stuff. I Considering that the system package manager pulls python packages from the distros package repository, that reservation is without merit.

That's really cool. The problem, from the post, is "he needed to count all the pairs from a sentence", for example: txt="What is life without life" # in his example He needed, "how many li is in the sentence"... two right? "How many, "fe", two... and so on. Your example output this: {"De": 1} {"id": 1} {"re": 1} My example output this: {"De": 1} {"id": 2} {"re": 2} I'm using the regex to make a "pattern" to looking for, on the sentence, that's why i needed. But, thanks man... you showed me something i didn't know. When you have the knowledge, is other level. The `pairwise` really nice. I i'll use it, instead of the `for` loop with `zip`. &amp;#x200B; Again, thanks a lot for the wisdom! =\] 
Looks good. I started using News API the other day but I'm only using one very specific call so I'm just using Requests. One thing I noticed on a quick skim, in queries.py you're doing something funky to validate a date format. The builtin datetime library has [datetime.strptime](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) which should do what you're trying to achieve in a more readable way.
I use loads of built-in Linux utilities, like: `dig`, `whois`, `tcpdump`, etc. A couple of other FOSS utilities, like [nmap](https://nmap.org) and [shodan](https://cli.shodan.io). I roll a lot of my own utilities at work, but most of those aren't shareable, since they're specific to our network environment. The other Python script that I built for forensic work that I have been able to release openly is `pdf-metedata`: [https://gitlab.com/nxl4/pdf-metadata](https://gitlab.com/nxl4/pdf-metadata). It's a low-level binary carver, that extracts all of the available metedata objects (document information dictionaries, XMP metadata streams, and file system metadata) from a PDF file, and structures it into a report. 
Run it and see for yourself?
I'm really new to python so can't help (sorry) but I would appreciate if you keep me up to date with your progress. The project sounds very interesting. 
I agree. I do not intend to keep that method of verifying dates, I will work on that as soon as possible. Thanks for the suggestion.

Damn, this looks very awesome. Have you shared your code anywhere?

Well a condition would be n % 2 == 0 or n % 2 != 0 or something. Just calling n % 2 doesn't mean anything

I haven't used venv, but my understanding is that conda is an alternative to pip + venv that is better for managing nonpython dependencies.
&gt;An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. ~ Wikipedia
I think you’re absolutely right understanding the task of programming will make you a better product owner. If you’re looking for another language to learn I would find something with different design decisions from python. The most basic design of python is the duck typing, so I would be looking for something statically typed. Java or C# would be good static typed languages to learn on as they are fairly simple. I would recommend spending some time learning the Unix shell if that isn’t a skill you’re already picking up along the way. I might also learn some of the weird quirks of JavaScript since it’s weird (read awful) and getting harder to avoid. One thing you’ll find as you become a better programmer is that language is more about preference and picking the right tool for the job. Once you know how to program you can pretty quickly learn how to express a program in a new language. The real skill is the ability to break a task into the discrete steps a computer can understand with an efficient program.

Ok, thanks to give me your feedback.
This topic landscape gives me anxiety. Oh yeah that's why I stopped watching the news. Good job BTW.
Another meaningless comparison? Please refrain from spamming you blog here in he future.
Google PRAW python, it's relatively easy to get a basic scrape bot together, took me 30 minutes to set up a rudimentary one because I had proxy issues. Then you just refine to what you want to look for, it's really cool.
If you want something simple and don't mind terminal output then the curses library is suitable: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html For more advanced plotting functions check out matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/ If you want to create something more advanced with a UI etc then there are many options but Kivy is a good library: https://kivy.org/#home
What module can I use to make visualisations like these? I can do the web scraping part. But I’d really like to know what module in python allows you to do this kind of mapping and visualisation. 
Cool! Is the source code open-source? :)
This sounds really interesting, any chance you're willing to share the names of the libs you're using to analyze the data?
How did you create the graphic? Gephi?
PS it's very slick looking!
c/c++ is always a solid choice, but its not very beginner friendly. It really depends on what you mean by "big data", e.g. if it's mainly to do with machine learning, the framework is more important than the language, e.g. there is tensorflow for python, but also c, java and go. If you do distributed computing with hadoop or spark java may be worth a look. 
Thanks for the reply. Are you right about using PRAW though in this instance? PRAW seems to be Reddit specific and the [Guardian’s API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/) looks very different.
Split the project into 2 parts. Automate the data collection. Then take the data and create the dashboard. Lastly, Marry the two scripts to run automatically

If you're developing, though, you'll also be installing a bunch of your own (possibly shitty) code in there as well. Not to mention the many packages which are on pyPI and not on the distro package repo, when you need to use pip anyway.
That consideration is large orthogonal to your claim, that using the system package manager to install system packages, could somehow mess up the system python installation-..
Google selenium, looks a bit more complex but should be able to accomplish something like this
Take a basic text editor. Now add syntax highlighting, code completion, and an integrated shell and debugger. Now you've got an IDE. Done.
This is dataporn 
This doesn't explain how to use my package with something in a different location. So in this example, let's say I'm working in a directory PythonCode. I can make a the Animals package and have PythonCode/Animals/Mammals and PythonCode/Animals/Birds. Then if I make a test file in PythonCode, I can access my package. But if I am in a different folder in PythonCode it doesn't work. Like say I want to use my Animals code in a Zoo project. I make a new folder PythonCode/Zoo with zoo.py inside and it can't find Animals. There has to be a way for me to link my classes from Animals to my Zoo code without having Animals in my Zoo directory.
The world of "Big Data" is pretty language agnostic... I mean Hadoop is _implemented_ in Java, but you can run jobs on Hadoop in effectively any language that can produce an executable file... the same is true for most distributed computing platforms. So I'd tend to say learn one language and learn it very well. Six months isn't enough, it takes 3-5 years to really get to know the depth and breadth of Python.
This looks great. Is there a way to get the progress of the jobs as they're happening? I want to be able to update a tqdm progress bar based on the job status.

How did you create the visualization I really liked it did you use JS like D3js
The I agree with current top reply. You need to understand technologies, not language and implementation. Studying a single programming language will limit you in scope of that language (since each language has its own strengths and weaknesses), but instead you should be flexible. Also here you shoul go very deeply into one PL (to understand for example how is encoding really done in security), or learn several, but in surface, where it's not really useful. There are a lot of books (that I cannot recall right now), that are like "IT for managers", which start from "what's the difference between back end and front end" and "what is a database and why do we need it?" to complex thing like "security" or "cloud computing". In fact it's a matter of product type: finance, marketing, entertainment. Each one uses specific set of tools, but the books are good for general approach.

I don’t know why nobody shares their code anymore. It’s like watching people pull their hair out every time I ask to see an implementation in my data sonification class. Put it on github and there is proof it’s yours and you created it. What are you worried about?

Hey! I am starting my first text-based game as a personal project to help strengthen some of my programming skills. I just wanted to thank you for posting this! This is a great little references for me to look back at with regard to structuring and packaging the files. Thanks! When its loading, where is it calling the map/map_builder from?
did he get fired? did you show him the screenshots?
So the gathering resource option isn’t working at the moment. I just added it yesterday. For the map_builder function is in the Map_Gen file and in that is a file named Engine.py. All map calls are in it. Thanks for the kind words!!! Keep looking back. We update it quite often.
Selenium. It's the best tool for the job.
for an actual example, let's say: groceries = ['eggs', 'bread', 'onions'] you might want to do: for i in range(len(groceries)): print(groceries[i]) but could more easily be: for item in groceries: print(item) will what if you still want the number itself? the next example shows that that's easy too for index, item in enumerate(groceries): print(str(index), item)

The term for reading data from images is "OCR" (optical character recognition). There's several python hooks for that. I've had pretty good luck with tesseract. 
Fortunately I don't need to recognize characters, I need only to find which box the user has ticked.
OH, you want to use python as a scantron? Yes you could do that. The hardest part will be rotating and scaling the image. After that PIL/opencv/numpy can easily find a region out of a set with more color. 
Maybe you could license it to your company and earn some extra cash! Maybe other industries need it too? Congrats on your build.
Opencv might help. It has functions that look specifically for squares and boxes. From there you could just check which one is filled in.
Another user also suggested some integration with tqdm; I think that is a great addition for the next release. In the meantime, it is possible to enable debug-level logging to see jobs being started and completed. It’s not currently possible to monitor or wait for a specific job(s), aside from calling ‘get()/collect()’ repeatedly until the desired job is retrieved. If you supply a timeout when putting jobs in the queue, you can be certain they will come out the other end.
Nice! Good luck. 
I was making a point about why you shouldn't install *things* to your system python. Because if you depend on system package manager-installed python libraries, you must be developing with the system python, which means you will also be installing things into your system python which doesn't come from your system package manager.

It's hard to know what you need without seeing your code and a more precise question but if I understand you correctly: &gt; How do I find out how many bytes in a byte string when I can only view it as UTF-8? If you want to find the length in bytes of a byte sequence you can use `len`: &gt;&gt;&gt; len(b'hello') 5 Anyway, encrypted text is basically pseudorandom and is very unlikely to be valid UTF-8. As for dealing with longer plaintext: don't just split your data manually, use a standard _mode of operation_ (hint: search the PyCryptodome documentation for that phrase) to make RSA accept arbitrary length inputs.
It’s multi use because of all the library’s you can use 
Doesn't really look like it. Integrating it would be more like rewriting it entirely in Javascript or C#, whichever one Lidarr uses for most of its stuff. If I have some time, I could revise my program to make it usable for anyone who wants it. We'll see.

Get time immediately after the first input, then wait for the second one and get time again. //First input time1 = datetime.datetime.now().time() //Second intput time2 = datetime.datetime.now().time() timeDifference = time2 - time1 print(timeDifference.microseconds) timeDifference is timedelta object.

Sure, you shouldn't need a particularly powerful machine _as long as_ the program is written well. Think about: * Data structures. How do you store documents and things like undo/redo information? How can you extract information from it in order to know what to display on screen? How does it deal with edits? Can you change a line in the middle of the document without having to copy a lot of data? Can you deal with documents with very long lines, or many lines? * Algorithms. Think about what kind of algorithms you use to implement operations, and how the run time and memory usage changes when the document grows. If the document is twice as long, does it get two times slower or four times slower? (I'm talking about Big Oh notation, if you're aware of it.) * Cache-effectiveness. It's not _easy_ to optimally use things like registers and the L1-cache in Python, but trying to make sure you don't have to access memory all over the place when you can avoid it can really help. * Threads/parallel processing. There isn't a lot you can do here but in general for GUIs: make sure the user interface has its own thread that doesn't do any heavy lifting to make sure your application _feels_ responsive to the user.
Great idea and yeah, I know I have to choose. Will start researching job posting and go from there. 
Four spaces? I always just use tabs when I indent. What's wrong with tabs?
Maybe I can share some of my Python experience to inspire you, I was a developer out of school, PHP, CSS, SQL, little knowledge of Javascript, read about C++ and Java multiple times through multiple books but no practice. I then got into trading, mostly day trading, so got into web bots, .Net web automation to scrap market data. Then to Python, Selenium, Pandas, data science since its all about numbers, math. And so I wrote many smart bots to make mostly accurate short term stock predictions that worked for years. So I didn't study Python to solve a problem, I found an interesting problem first then Python came by surprise. Notice I read all about C++ and Java many years ago but never found it interesting since I had no practical use for it. Then I forgot most of that public, static void, main {} stuff, have to relearn at some point. Recently as I was attempting to use the bot it was blocked by a bot detection service, so after little digging around I found out I can actually build a very good bot detector since I used to build bots, I know their behavior and weaknesses better than others. Now I just released my latest work for free for others if they want to stop data bots from scraping their entire web site. Feel free to check it out at [https://www.botdetector.ca](https://www.botdetector.ca) &amp;#x200B; So my point is maybe you should find the problem in real life first and then use your IT skills to solve it.
Would you be willing to post the source data? I'd like to take a crack at visualizing it.

Because it is the standard, that's really it. A lot of text editors convert tabs to 4 spaces, so it isn't really a big deal if you use tabs, and it isn't really a big deal either way. I personally just use tabs because it is faster and make sure that whatever editor I'm using converts it to 4 spaces. There are some absolute maniacs who use 3 spaces, although I've never seen one in the wild. And some people use 1 space. It doesn't change how the interpreter reads the code so long as all indentations are the same, but if you're writing something that someone else will need to use and modify it makes sense to follow the standard.
A little application that helps you perfect and debug your code
Thanks! That’s a really good suggestion. I definitely need to figure out the flow before I can even tackle any code. 
Wow! query, assign, and style.format in one code snippet!

Well then... we doin this?
aw fuck yeah
Sweet, will add that. Thanks
Got it the file open = needed a 'r'
This looks really helpful for a project I'm working on involving a few hundred http requests - I'll compare with asyncio as I'm not sure what will work best. If I do, I'll have to write tests for it regardless (medical industry requirements), so expect a pull request or three ;) 
Ok thanks for the explanation!
RescueTime does exactly what you're looking for. I'm not sure if the point of the post is to make it yourself, or just have the data to analyze, by maybe look into that. If anything, it can help you think of how you might try to build this

At first all I could think of was a 4D regular 4-polytope, or 4-cube. But then I remembered it was also a free OCR engine. Thanks for the reminder!
Me too!!
Definetly check out BeautifulSoup if you haven't already
I tend to think bootcamps are a waste of money and time. Find problems that you can learn to solve and generate an archive of code to handle those problems. That becomes your toolbox that you can show off to potential clients/customers and to draw upon for future problems.
Why didn't you just create a new environment with Python 3.7? I really don't get why you're trying to force a Python update (which is critical to every Python package in the environment) instead a creating a separate env.
I totally second this!
I think you really need to see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U).
You seem pretty knowledgable so I wonder if I can ask you this.. I may be teaching a bunch of first year mechanical engineering students the basics of programming using Python next year and I'm wondering if IDLE would be sufficient? It seems like it would result in the least extra stuff to learn and have a nice barebones environment.
Don't you run your .py programs from the terminal? Why does it matter with atom about environments? 
Look for paid internships at places you'd be interested in working at. Depending on the company/organization, these positions can pay enough to get by, give you a foot in the door and allow you to learn with less pressure. I graduated with an MS in Mechanical Engineering and got an internship with a national lab primarily doing data science. I thought it'd just be a "foot in the door", and then I'd go back to materials testing. I ended up loving DS and worked hard at picking up new skills with Python and sold myself in my internship. 8 months later I landed a full time analysis position at the organization. Best 8 month decision I've made. Now I look for opportunities to expand my DS skillset in new projects. I still use my ME degree a little (and I'm sure it helps on my resume to have it as a background) but am largely pivoting to DS for the future.
I should add that at the time I got my internship, I was less experienced in coding than it sounds like you are. I had a couple years of Matlab in college and "taught" myself Python on the side. Another route to consider is getting a Master's in CS on the side. I don't have one so you'd have to ask others in here if it'd be too much theory or how practical it'd be getting into a program. If it's anything like engineering, there will be less theoretical programs that could be done at night and could really help boost your resume.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
You want to do template matching then. Finding the shift can be done in real-space or in Fourier-space (more typical) against a blank template. OpenCV can do that. It's a bit painful to use though. I think `scikit-image` also has some template matching functions.
I say just start applying to positions. The worst thing you can do is assume you have no shot. Likely you will have some difficulty finding a job at first since you don't have direct experience, but it only takes one organization to hire you for that too immediately go away. While you might not have direct experience, a lot of companies actually need people in data analyst and data science roles to teach and evangelize math and analytics. There's no team in business that isn't trying to be smarter and more efficient through math and data now. Smarter companies are realizing that hiring a couple of data scientists doesn't automatically succeed. Instead it's better to train everyone else to just be 5% better. Having someone in the company to lead those trainings and give feedback and validate the analysis of other teams goes a really long way. I think you might have some success interviewing if you really sell your math teaching background and how you can leverage that to boost the efficiency of everyone else. Definitely keep practicing with side projects. Definitely go through a few online courses on statistics. Maybe try your luck at a couple kaggle competitions. If you don't know SQL, learn it and practice on SQLzoo. I think you'll be able to get a data analyst job with that pretty easily, which should pay at least as well as math teacher.
You are supposed to be able to run atom from within atom using the script package or atom-python-run. It was not able to locate my pip packages from a virtual environment set up inside atom with pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv
Ohh sort of like an IDE basically then?

Any progress ?
&gt; When I print the byte string, it's not in 0s and 1s obviously, its encoded in UTF-8 I think, but only in the shell?? Not really. When you print it, it'll display (non-control) characters in the ASCII range as their character, but anything outside that range will be displayed as a control code. As you see, stuff like `\x08` means a byte with the hex value 8. If you want to see the numeric values, note that indexing the bytestring will give this (ie `x[0]` gives `8`), or for display, convert it to a list. Eg: &gt;&gt;&gt; b = b'hello' &gt;&gt;&gt; list(b) [104, 101, 108, 108, 111] But the escape code stuff is just for display - internally, it's just bytes, and there's no encoding going on when accessing them. Getting the length is just a matter of calling `len()` on it. &gt;From what I understand, RSA can only encrypt up to the key length (in this case 2048 bits Usually RSA is only used for key exchange, as it's very slow. Ie. typically you'll use it to communicate the key to a regular symmetric stream cipher (eg. AES), and then the actual *message* gets encrypted with that. I'm not that familiar with TOR's internals, but I'd be surprised if it's using RSA to communicate actual messages. &gt;The only work-around I can see is to split the byte string output into multiple smaller parts and encrypt those separately This is actually a bad idea, at least done the naive way, as it can leak information. Eg. consider what happens when your parts contain repeated information. If two parts of the message are identical, then their encryption will also be identical, and so at attacker will be able to know this just from the ciphertext. Typically, more sophisticated ways of chaining together blocks are used, where the output of the previous part feeds into the input to the next. Eg one way is to XOR with the previous block prior to encryption (called Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)). That way patterns aren't revealed (though it comes at the cost that the message must be decrypted sequentially). Typically these details will (and *should*) be handled by your encryption library, so you should let that handle it unless rolling your own is the point of the exercise.
From the docs for `np.multiply`, if the parameter `out` is `None` (which it is by default), then a new array is allocated. Accessing uninitialized values in an array is undefined behavior. The values at the indices where your mask is `True` contain values from the multiplication, and the values where your mask is `False` contain uninitialized values---not the values from either input array (i.e. `dT_` and `ht_const`).
Yes, and no. If you're serious about running a company, drama is a luxury you avoid. The best you can do is cut the lost asap. Also, as the employer so I didn't need that many reasons to let him go. However, I clearly made him know that I knew what he was doing when I was out of the office and this was why didn't need him anymore.
Not to take anything away from your video... For getting a CNN up and running pretty quickly, I can't really recommend the fast.ai framework enough. I've had really good experiences with it.
Thanks, I appreciate it. I built it in my free time during work hours, so I think anything made on company time becomes company software unfortunately. The program itself is specific to our company, so it couldn't be given out to other companies in the same industry. The packages and libraries used to do this could be used for other industries, but the coding is specific to that website or set of webpages.
Couple things: First of all thank you for this. It got me thinking outside of the box that I've closed myself in - doing exactly what you described: llooking for problems to solve with Python. I've come across a lot of problems I wanted to solve where eventually my lack of knowledge in JavaScript, jquery, SQL etc became a roadblock - eventually causing me to move in a different direction. I can say you've definitely accomplished your goal of inspiring me with this post. I've already started looking back at my past projects left unfinished. Again, thank you for this post. It's a significant paradigm shift that I've needed to embrace all along. Also, Botdetector is particularly impressive. And 60%?! That is remarkable. Creates big opportunity for your project. Using coinhive to fund your project is very savvy as well. I'll definitely be trying it out shortly. Thanks again!
The byte string is *definitely* not text encoded in UTF-8. Its just a bunch of bytes. There's no obvious way of telling just by looking at them if they have any meaning at all. We know its not UTF-8 because when you try to decode it as if it were, there's an invalid continuation byte. That means that the bytes don't make up valid UTF-8 (just as they probably don't make up a valid JPEG, or a valid .docx file). You say: &gt; When I print the byte string, it's not in 0s and 1s obviously You misunderstand. **All** data in the computer is stored as bits. Each bit takes on two values: either a 0 or a 1. So all data, whether it is a text file, a JPEG image, videos, encrypted data, even this web page you are looking at now, is made up of 1s and 0s. This is true in the same sense that all matter, everything you touch, drink, eat or breath, is made up of nothing but protons, neutrons and electrons. Its true but irrelevant. Representing data as bits is convenient for the computer but horrible for people, so we collect groups of eight bits (one byte). Actually, bytes are more convenient for computers too, but that's a complication that you don't need to care about. If you do the maths, it turns out that if you look at eight bits, there are exactly 256 distinct combinations (starting with `00000000` and going to `11111111`) so it is really handy to treat each byte as a number between 0 and 255. Remember: bytes are *numbers*. Partly for historical reasons, and partly for practical reasons, we prefer to view bytes in [*hexadecimal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) (base 16) instead of base 10. So instead of counting "0, 1, 2, 3, ... 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, ..." in decimal, we count "0, 1, 2, 3, ... 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11 ..." in hex. In Python, when displaying bytes, the interpreter uses two conventions: - Bytes that represent visible [ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii) are shown as that character, so for example the byte `5a` (in hex, 90 in decimal) is shown as "Z" and the byte `40` (or 64 in decimal) is shown as "@". - Bytes that don't represent visible ASCII characters are (usually) shown as hex escapes, e.g. the byte `B9` (in hex, or 185 in decimal) is shown as `\xb9`. So your byte-string starts with these three bytes: `\x08\xefO`. That means byte `08` (in hex, or just 8 in decimal), byte `EF` (239 in decimal) and byte `4F` (79 in decimal). In binary, those three characters would be: 000010001110111101001111 so you can see why we don't usually display bytes as raw bits. So forget about UTF-8. UTF-8 is a more modern (and complicated) version of ASCII which can be used to represent thousands of different letters from many different languages, but it isn't relevant here. You are working with byte-strings, sequences of *numbers* between 0 and 255. The fact that Python happens to display some of those numbers as ASCII characters is a convenience for some uses, but not for yours. So don't use the decode method. It isn't needed, and won't work except by accident. Just work with the byte strings.
Looks very useful. Does it support shared objects across the parallel instances? 
Do you have a preferred module?
Thanks! I might look into a masters. Do you think you could have gotten the Data Science position without your engineering background? One of the concerns I have is my lack of a "specialty". Not sure how necessary that is in most Data Science positions. 
When you launch IPython, Jupyter Notebook, or Spyder, you are actually firing either a .bat or .exe file located in your environment's &lt;envname&gt;/scripts folder. If you don't have those packages installed in your new environment, then Windows will search other locations in your `PATH` variable on your system. In other words, it will launch Jupyter Notebook from your root environment when it does not find it in your current environment. So what can you do? You can install jupyter and ipython to your new environment via: conda install -n py36 jupyter ipython Or you can install install ipython and ipykernel to your new environment; nb_conda_kernel to your root environment, and then when you launch jupyter notebook, you are still launching it form your root environment, but the additional conda environments are visible for notebooks. conda install -n py36 ipython ipykernel conda install -n base nb_conda_kernels Now when you run `jupyter notebook` you see additional conda environments for your kernel, as long as they have ipykernel installed. Also, you can add R kernels and run them from jupyter as well if you install r-irkernel conda create -n R r-base r-irkernel -c r Here is a screen cap where I created an environment called `test` that shows up from the root jupyter notebook. https://imgur.com/uvBqxpl

Check out [PySimpleGUI'](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org)s graphing widget. Here's an example program that creates a 400 x 400 graph and draws a series of rectangles. The way this particular graph is specified is that it the lower left is 0,0 and the upper right is 400,400. It's essentially the upper right quadrant of a graph with 0,0 at the bottom left. The sample code draws 10 rectangles. To run it with Life, draw your rectangles using this line of code: \` graph.DrawRectangle(top\_left, bot\_right, fill\_color='red', line\_color='red')\` Please post your program once you get something running.. it'll be cool to see. 
This is just a mock-up I made for a custom flask on Zazzle. It's damn near impossible to describe this to a search engine, so I don't know whether or not these already exist or are legal in the first place. But if someone else wants to make these (and donate profits to the Python foundation maybe idk), then I think that would be a good thing for the community.
I'm not totally following...? Are you talking about creating scripts in other python modules and doing imports? If so, I'm already doing that. ...am i missing something?

Please help... I can save the input “x1” when printing x1... How should I do it, I’m really sorry if I did this stupidly... 
Could you post the actual code as comment. Then I can try to run it and see what's wrong. Kind regards.
I'll gild you if you promise never to make that shitty pun again.
I promise. 
Dammit I just got bamboozled!
You have your mainloop() location inside out; it's inside a function that is only called when a button is pressed, so how can it be running to handle the button press? &amp;#x200B; Create the Tk() object outside of lol(), and call it after setting up your buttons and callbacks, etc. This basic framework should be demonstrated in literally \*any\* Tkinter tutorial, so whichever one you are using now, Google for another one to see the basic setup steps for the Tk() app and mainloop().
So did I apparently.

Making simple common interface for pubsub pattern. [aio-pubsub](https://github.com/bruziev/aio_pubsub)
Actually I'm literally about to settle in and start learning Python! :D
How can I find whoch xhr to use? There are a bunch of them when I load the page. Thanks
Just to add this piece of info: Uninitialized means “interpret whatever bytes there have been already as float” - that’s why it’s bogus :)

I can get x12 when I print it inside the def piece12(): But I can’t get the value when I print it outside the def... HELP ME, I’m sorry if I did this stupidly
You are maybe not aware of a click addon that exposes the cli as a web interface?
Have you converted the x12 to string?
Not too solid on Python but you seem to have defined the function within another function which is a bit strange (correct me if I’m wrong). You should look at the scope of your variables - look at global variables and how to use them!
It looks like you are trying to access x12 outside the scope of the function. Maybe copy paste the code in a comment.
It's the scope, x12 is only inside the scope of the function, so inside it you can access it, but from outside its no longer in scope. But try copy pasting your code, it might make it easier to help.
Ye I have define a function within another function becuz I want to click on the first button and will pop out another page with another button to record the input for the entry... But somehow when I want to print the variable for the input outside all of the def... it remain unknown. Mind telling me if it’s possible to set the inputed value for the entry(x12) to be permanent?? So I won’t have to worried it will become an unknown when I print x12 outside the def?
Try inserting the line global x12 at the start of wow11 and piece12. If that doesn't work, you'll need to post the error message
`x12` is local in `piece12()`. See [FAQ on "What are the rules for local and global variables in Python"](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#what-are-the-rules-for-local-and-global-variables-in-python)
Nice! Stealing this. Or should I say "gift-pull"? :D
dont define functions in functions. read an intro to python book.
So again I only have a basic understanding of Python but you’re going to want to look at classes and variable scope. Regarding the variable scope you’ll be interested in the global one. Read up on the basics of those things and it should make more sense!
/r/machinelearning
I think that this is for r/learnpython
You can use While def main(): while True: a = int(input()) &amp;#x200B; b = int(input()) &amp;#x200B; c=(a\*a-b\*b)/(2\*a+1) &amp;#x200B; print(c) &amp;#x200B; if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_': print("\\033c", end="") main()
Use while True: And then indent all of your code.

I'm also really interested in this. Any good learning sources for people interested in coding for GIS ?
Nice!
Is this using the detection timestamp as a proxy for radius? If so how are the clocks synchronized on the IOT devices?
The timestamps are used to determine the difference in radius that the device is from two towers. No clock is used on the IoT devices. Only clocks are used on the receiving towers, which in practice would be synchronised with GPS.
This question belongs in /r/Learnpython. Please refer to the posting guidelines over there.

By "automating accounting" what do you mean? Or rather, what are the features needed? Personally, ill start with this. Then ill lookup for accounting software that match those features (ps: there are plenty of accounting software, open source &amp; written in python). Finally, ill workout the integration.
Why not? Functions are first-class in Python.
I think after a while you should not need cheatsheets, methinks.
&gt; It's damn near impossible to describe this to a search engine The plight of Go developers 
Background: I was hired as a data analyst, moved on to what I'd describe as "business intelligence" (though my company didn't use the term) and ultimately joined the new data science team. I think there's not nearly enough discussion of the differences between the various data jobs, and the different skills that will lead to success in each. So people are anxiously studying linear algebra when they should be focused on SQL and basic dashboard design, or vice-versa. As much as Machine Learning is sexy, I tend to advise against it for people entering the field. DS/ML at our company (a medium sized American tech company in a niche market) pretty strictly filters out resumes of people without professional programming experience or a PhD. But your background would easily qualify for our business intelligence teams, and (based on the level of initiative that you've already shown) I think you'd be a valued contributor within a year. By the time you had 2-3 years of experience, you would be in a great place to make a move (if you want! I liked my BI days, and only moved because they gave me a \~25% raise to help start DS/ML). That touches on the downside: The pay is less for BI work (which I'll define as producing outputs of dashboards and reports, instead of deployed ML models). But it will not be a step down from teaching, based on what an 8y teacher makes in my area, and there will be more growth as you gain experience. Plus, much more career flexibility. 
Check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/businessintelligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessintelligence), [https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/data\_warehousing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/data_warehousing/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/visualization/](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualization/) for inspiration about what those roles could look like. &amp;#x200B; Also: I'd estimate that there are at least 10x as many BI folks (counting those who do it &gt;50% of their time, potentially paired with more directly operational role) as DS/ML. &amp;#x200B; If you're determined to be technical, also consider Data Engineering. I've never been that, so I won't go as deeply into it, but it's also 5x larger at most companies, and even harder to hire for than DS/ML

Is pun really appropriate christmas gift? Is it just a goof and you'll be fine if they throw it away the next day? I mean who uses actual flask even on monthly bases? Or maybe I'm just missing some obvious usage? 
It's hard to put into all words, it's all intuition for me. If you wanna identify the important request, examine the parameters in the `Request URL` field in the `Headers` tab of the XHR if it's a GET request. If it's a POST request there's a `FORM DATA` section in the headers tab if you scroll below. Inspect this data to see if this is what you entered into the webpage. Then go to the `Preview` tab to see the response for that particular request (the `Response` tab is similar, just that Preview presents it in a navigable format and prettifies it.) and inspect the data in it. If it's similar to what's being shown on the webpage, you'll know that's what you're looking for. There are certain APIs which require sending of certain cookies before showing you the data so sometimes these APIs might not return any response if you emulate just one particular request with your code. Then you need to inspect which requests are made before the one which gives you the actual data, and emulate those as well (you need to maintain a session in this case) before emulating the one you need. As you inspect more client-side rendered webapps you'll get this intuition as well and then it's a game of trial-n-error to arrive at your solution.
I think they use golang as the keyword with their searches.
Yes, use pep8 and a linter to enforce it
&gt;Mind telling me if it’s possible to set the inputed value for the entry(x12) to be permanent?? So I won’t have to worried it will become an unknown when I print x12 outside the def? You need to define and set the value of x12 outside the function, and then pass it as a parameter. 
It was particularly terrible with the requests library for node. Searching "node requests caching" not surprisingly returned discussions on how to cache content for web servers.
OK, got it. I did something similar--not with LoRa--a few years ago and the receivers were microcontrollers. Synchronizing the clocks was a pain.
I really can't say. For now I'm pretty-much-only using my own lib, "ergo", because I've been working on my one huge CLI project which I made ergo for (lol) -- there's only one other Python lib that has the same concept of grouping as in ergo, which is 10000% something I need, but (1) I hadn't found it when I started my development and (2) it makes a lot of design decisions I just cannot agree with (and which on the whole just seem foreign to Python). Now, setting my own dogfooding aside, I really don't have a preference... I would go with one many people know and are happy with, like click or Fire. Heck, OP's thing here looks like a solid contender as well. It seems to be easier to come up with a list of "dislikes" rather than "likes", so... in case you wanted that: - I don't like libs that just wrap argparse in a decorator or two - or libs that can't follow common Python convention and/or don't do anything new but are touted as being groundbreaking (cough Easycli cough) - I used to think docopt was beautiful but after seeing some bigger codebases that use it... *yikes*. Using it is enjoyable, but parsing the output it gives you is a bit more and it is not pretty. - click has too many decorators, although people do seem to be fine with it so take my opinion here with some grains of salt
u should definitely read the book DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM book
Going to make a mass texting program where the user can type a message and it will generate tailored messages for each person in a supplied table of names and phone numbers. I figured out how to generate the messages, so I just need to implement file reading and sending the actual texts. My biggest concerning is getting applescript to actually connect to iMessage, I feel like its going to be a disaster and I’ll have to settle for twilio.
Python offers documentation in their official webpage. That’s how I started! Good luck!😉

There are tons of MOOCs available right now on Udemy and Udacity and edX. Take up any one which has the best reviews. Basics of python are very easy if you know Java or C already. Even not, it is not rocket science. I found Java and C more time-consuming than Python. I learnt it from an MIT course which is redacted now, but even then if you can find it, the code of that course was MIT 6.00.1x. I personally think studying from an MOOC is much better than from a book. I never learnt a thing from a book. There are many Udemy courses at minimal cost too. You can take a look at my website and my projects, if they can do any help.

&gt; who uses actual flask even on monthly bases? people who go to concerts a lot, alcoholics, teens, some women in college that I knew who liked to smuggle booze into a gay bar to save money, and probably other people as well
Excellent, please let me know the results of the comparison; that will be interesting. Also, PRs are welcome; I appreciate the assistance!
Good question. Because `ezpq` wraps around `multiprocessing` and/or `threading`, shared objects would be handled in a different way for each scenario. I whipped up the code below to illustrate and will add it to the README. For shared object access using `multiprocessing.Process` as the job runner (default): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiprocessing-python-set-2/ ```python import ezpq import multiprocessing as mp def increment(x): x[0] += 1 with mp.Manager() as mp_mgr: shared_object = mp.Manager().list([0]) with ezpq.Queue() as Q: for _ in range(100): Q.put(increment, shared_object) Q.wait() print(shared_object[0]) #&gt; 100 ``` For shared object access using `threading.Thread` as the job runner: ```python import ezpq import threading from queue import Queue def increment(x): x.put( x.get()+1 ) shared_object = Queue() shared_object.put(0) with ezpq.Queue(job_runner=threading.Thread) as Q: for _ in range(100): Q.put(increment, shared_object) Q.wait() print(shared_object.get()) #&gt; 100 ```
Just put it on your desk/book shelf even if you never intend to drink out of it?

I would imagine the underscore would cause mass confusion for teachers, camelCase I think they could handle. 
Ah, a commit hook. Good idea!
CamelCase always.
I would also like to suggest that you can achieve the same functionality in an arguably more "pythonic" way using comprehensions and zip. Let fnc be a function that performs an arbitrary operation on two elements (a and b) and returns their result, then we can iterate over the two lists as follows: result = [fnc(a, b) for a, b in zip(numbers1, numbers2)] There are some differences between this and map, namely map is lazy and list comprehensions are not - we can recreate this functionality by using a generator expression instead: result = (fnc(a, b) for a, b in zip(numbers1, numbers2)) I find that comprehensions more explicitly state what's happening in the code. Granted this requires someone reading the code to understand what zip does, but I think the concept of "zipping" interables is more straightforward compared to map's syntax. For the sake of being explicit, I also think it's hard to argue the benefits of a lambda function over simply defining a named function locally. I'll sacrifice an extra line of code for clarity any day. 
Check out folium
Thanks! This is super helpful. This is pretty much the type of position that I figured would be a foot in the door. Didn't know that it had a different name. 
I think that this question is for r/learnpython
Much more important is choosing a descriptive name. 
Boooooo
Considering that this is a case of inheritance, I believe you should use PascalCase - as is appropriate for a class name.
&gt;Is pun really appropriate christmas gift? Is it just a goof and you'll be fine if they throw it away the next day? I mean who uses actual flask even on monthly bases? Or maybe I'm just missing some obvious usage? &gt; &gt; The Flask Framework cult is real. They mindlessly upvote anything remotely related to their url router. They're only slightly better than the bots that upvote any post that claims to discuss data science regardless of its quality.
I think this would be better with just the flask logo and no text
You're welcome! It's great if a newbie is motivated and tries a lot. And it's even greater if he accept critics and understand it as a great way to learn further technics. Keep going my friend! You're attitude is the right one 😉

&gt; CamelCase That's Pascal case. Camel case doesn't start with a capital letter.
Thanks man! That is very motivating to hear!!!! 
I agree on that, comprehension tutorials and zip tutorial will follow.
I have been totally surprised by your reaction - and by so many up votes! Often newbies feel personally attacked if one shows bad things in their code and dont make more nice comments about it. But imho the motivation must be intrinsic, thus you have to have the will to learn by yourself! So critics are not a critic on your abilities but a way to show the next steps a newbie should or could take. But it is very seldom that someone understand this exactly as it is meant - you did! And that's really a positive surprise... ... And that so many people share my advices too! 😊
Same
Me too
Kudos to this comment. That should really be the priority, It took me a second to process the request lol.
(Second to last line in the left window.)
ok, but what clock speed ? ATMEGA32U4 for cpu or do I need faster ?
Same for a `list`, a `bytes`, and a `bytearray`.
I was legit looking for these but they’re impossible to find haha

I’ve been wanting to see it too...
camelCase would allow his name to be used in the most contexts with least issue.
Dunder camel case with hungarian notation.
This becomes a useful trick for making lines (e.g. for separating sections in your CLI output). print("=" * 80) 
I've seen software call PascalCase CamelCase and camelCase mixedCase, though I can't remember what software it was.
Very good explanation of the correct way to see Constructive Criticism. I really really really really want to be better at this Craft and so to hear all the awesome new ways and better ways to execute my ideas is really neat to see. I am 32 and I’ve always wanted to learn to program when I was younger but until last year I never really give it a shot. To learn anything you have to go into it knowing you have to keep an open mind and not lock down on one way of doing things. Especially programming, where there are tons of ways to do the same thing and I am still learn the things to avoid. From this post I have learned how to better use Classes, the way you should use global variable or at least sparingly if any, not to use a function to recall its self for a loop because that will make a memory leak, How to make your code more dynamic and pythonic, also why and how not to hard core things in areas, last but not least I have learned not to look a project as a hole but as many many many small projects and the task is less daunting. Maybe one day I can get a job as a programmer. Thanks again for the very kind words! God bless ya man!
Made something similar awhile ago: https://github.com/etano/nyan_plot

Aah but it reqs numpy. Trying to avoid large libraries to keep this exe under 50mb. I’m pulling 5 columns from SQL and just need those in a basic bar graph. So extensive computing and graphing libraries aren’t necessary. Thanks.
Flasks are great to take to weddings.
It really depends on my method of connection. Surely, I enjoy PyCharm but it won’t run in a terminal when the box I am connected to is running headless. Yes - I code remotely sometimes because I like it. 
You can name her McKenzie. Please don't name her \_.
I thought camelcase did, and the one with a lowercase first letter was mixed case
because it's pretty awful form, hard to read, and unnecessary. Just because you can doesn't mean you should define in defines, it obfuscates your code and shows amateur understanding of function use. If you just need the function inside the other function, don't write the second function, its a waste of time. Also no one will ever hire you for that type of code, for good reason. again: read an intro to python book.
Baby’s head is stuck. Doctor, pull request!
Can I see the code to do it it’s so pretty 
And you can modify snake_case to omit the underscores. Or modify camelCase to omit the uppercase letters.
I know you're not asking me, but plumbum by far. 
Don't forget the doc string though.
Pandas
Ah fair enough, that is a heavy dependency but very common. Are you trying to fit an AWS lambda? If you are then it’d be worth checking out their new python layer that includes numpy/scipy etc. to see if that works for you. If you’re not then out of interest why 50mb?
pandas does not come with a plotting library. It uses matplotlib. It also requires numpy.
But it's totally valid if you are writing functional code and not thinking in the OOP paradigm. Python Decorators are nested functions and I'm sure that is covered in the intro python book. And if you really want to go into functional programming, you can't achieve currying and partial application without nested functions. There is nothing amateur'ish about writing functional code. Get off your high horse and open your mind.
just go to erlang for that, use python for python. Don't mix paradigms.
I'm going to recommend kebab-case, as I feel it doesn't get enough love in the python community.
No this is manually distributed for Windows. But I just want the size to make sense. I’m only loading a single bar graph. So the overhead of about 40-50mb of matplotlib makes this exe 87mb. Otherwise it’s about 47mb. I’m already importing pillow, so drawing a quick bar graph and storing the sql data in a basic array would be fine and remove time in downloading as well as launching it.
Damn that was fast! I have this one work-project coming in which I probably use this for logging. Expect issues to be opened if I find some bugs haha :D
Got you, that makes sense. What about distributing gnuplot with your exe (disclaimer: check its license!) and using Python’s subprocess library to programmatically run it? I don’t know its size but I expect it’s really small and its API is dead simple, might be worth trying.
Unfortunately this is not how nyan cat works :(
/r/ProgrammerHumor &amp;#x200B; This is hillarious. Also, camel case. Don't wan't your kid to get up because he/she didn't follow PIP....

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Lol... OP even says “Sorry I didn’t know about title case” because modified camel case is something they pulled out of their ass. 
I will look into this. My tool is GPLv3 which makes it pretty compatible with most libraries :) 
Well, nobody loves syntax errors, so there's that.
Glad to know you will use it! Haha, I hope I didn't make too many mistakes while developping Loguru! Don't hesitate to open issues if you have questions or suggestions anyway.
Name it "myPerson" as he/she was created as `myPerson = Person()`

Very cool !

Just use `_` or `__` if this is your second.
Here's a toy example :) https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jPCjKbkp2sMDrqtnijX84Ys3vetH7XzA Hope it's helpful!
Take a look at r/learnpython.
For me, I don't share my code because I don't know if people actually would use it. I'm not sure if what I wrote was actually good or something other people will laugh at.
If it does something that you want it to do, successfully, don’t be worried. Anybody that wants to see it would most likely be learning from it because they aren’t already familiar with how to do it . Just make sure to give credit when using other peoples code tho !
Just have it check the last modified or date created timestamps and only try to rename stuff that’s like 30 seconds+ old.
snake_case since the baby is an instance, not a class. my_baby = Human(age=0)
(Disclaimer: I work for Snipcart :) ) When Stripe is integrated into a third party platform like Snipcart, there's no difference with transactions made using your own API Keys or through the platform. They'll look the same inside Stripe (with a few additional metadata that can help to link those with Snipcart's data). If you notice any quirks that you think we could improve to make reporting tools work better, let us know on support!
Check out the pychromecast library.
Looks like it's probably expecting an argument and you aren't passing it one.

Thank you! Accounting for this consistently provides the correct computation. 
If you want basic "plotting" capabilities where you draw the pieces of the graph yourself, then [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) is one way to go. I just created the EXE file that created a sine wave plot and it was 9 MB. Here is the code and a screenshot of the graph: [https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/397b681d1b3863a74936724fdfd1ea34](https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/397b681d1b3863a74936724fdfd1ea34) &amp;#x200B; You could use the graphing primitive DrawRectangle to draw bar graphs easy enough. &amp;#x200B; This Matplotlib demo required 240 MB for its EXE file, so yea, by comparison it's hefty. [https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/33579888cd976e2ef0231869bba38bb4](https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/33579888cd976e2ef0231869bba38bb4) These days size isn't such a big deal however. &amp;#x200B; I make scrolling bar charts using the PySimpleGUI drawing primitives for things like this rainmeter-like display: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/47599494-52514f80-d97d-11e8-86d2-13d21d1d373c.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/47599494-52514f80-d97d-11e8-86d2-13d21d1d373c.jpg) [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/47611749-18964c80-da42-11e8-93c4-6821a6fce488.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/47611749-18964c80-da42-11e8-93c4-6821a6fce488.gif) &amp;#x200B; It's one option should you not mind doing your own basic plotting routines.
Really proud of having almost finished my first game. Admittedly it's just pong, but there's just that satisfaction of seeing everything doing what I wanted it to
Sounds like some buggy software.

Hi there! Here is the infographic we made from results from this survey! [https://linuxacademy.com/blog/career/infographic-top-cloud-platforms-tech-skills-job-opportunities-salary-ranges/](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/career/infographic-top-cloud-platforms-tech-skills-job-opportunities-salary-ranges/)
(Forwarning I'm VERY new to python but have experience else where) Odd. Usually database access functions are blocking, as in your program shouldn't take the next step until it's done. Sometimes a separate thread will be used for the db OP to work around that but that's usually some heavy coding or the db access library you're using takes care of it for you. Most databases I've worked with have DBA functions or views which allow you to query current sessions and operations in the database. So you're probably on the right track to build a loop with sleep on checking that information for your dump to complete.
You could profile both to find the reason, but it's definitely not due to the removing on unused loop commands 
May hook this up to beauty rating NN if i can find a data set for it lel

Shorter version that fits in a tweet with spare chars (python2 only. Sorry! :p) ```python -c"while 1:import os;s=locals().get('s','');s+=u'\u224B\u2261'[len(s)%2];os.system('sleep 0.1 &amp;&amp;clear');print s+' ~=[,,_,,]:3'"```
If you're really that concerned about speed, I would suggest not writing it in Python. You would do better with something like C/C++. That shouldn't be much of a worry here, though. What matters more than your clock speed is the actual effeciency of your code. Are your algorithms O(n), or are they something like O(n**3)? It doesn't matter how fast your CPU is; an algorithm with terrible complexity will not work regardless. Keep in mind that my parents' crappy computer in the 90's had a word processor on it, and it ran fine. 
Instead of scroll, repaint = animation
this is amazing. thanks for sharing
agreed. the scrolling produces bad looking artifacts at the bottom of the image
Here kitty kitty Python comes Bites cat Cat dies End of story !!
While amazing, given the beurocracy of the PyPA I think to catch on this would need a hard fork. There are things people have been asking for for ages with reasonably sound implementations or reference materials (see PEP 517 and 518), as well as other tools maintained and endorsed by the PyPA (see Pipfiles and pipenv) that don't have implementation into pip yet. There's tons of tools that could make use of such a system if it caught on though.
Hey. This is kinda late by reddit standards but I wasn't sure if you got a satisfying answer. First, it's never to late to learn and do something you feel passionate about! So I'd say it depends on what you want to do to be involved. You should get a high level overview of how AI and deep learning work. From a programming stand point it's getting a bunch of resources together for a series of decision nodes which make up a neural net. Then you feed that net mass amounts of data and the correct answers to "train" it. Then you can use that trained model elsewhere for AI decisions. So are you looking to get I to training your own models? Using publicly available models for some kind of app? Looking to get into the code used to train models (probably a very advanced topic), etc. No matter what though python is a good first language to learn and also used extensively for AI coding. That's why it comes so highly reccomended.
Aah ha! Thanks for posting. Going this route makes the most sense - Especially because PSG is already imported. Thanks I never realized you had a demo for a custom graph!!!
It doesn't matter. It doesn't affect the average Python user and many don't get a say in the process either. That said, it's futile anyway until Guido either dies or admits his "permanent vacation" is a faux faux pas. He has shown that albiet "stepping down" he still exerts his authority as dictator. Nothing wrong with that, but everything will be biased in his favor in the new model, and the moment he decides "eh I want the saddle", they will give it to him. I'm calling it now, the only way for a new governance model to truly occur is either a hard fork, or Guido himself choosing the new model and the powers that will guide it (if applicable), before entirely removing himself from the community entirely.
We don't need much, it has just been a huge pain in the ass to set up formatters, handlers and rotations every time you start a new PoC. Btw if you need to do C/C++ -stuff from Python, Cython is a great language for that. But if you don't mind wrapping libraries for Python then go for C/C++/Haskell :)
What would this do, anyway?
Good for you!!! I can really use some help on an assisgnment creating a bar code generator in JES python. please email me if you can help? I'm really stuggling and need the extra credit at school. Its supposed to be a beginning class but this assignment is crazy! [RMSRMS@optonline.net](mailto:RMSRMS@optonline.net). Thanks so much!
thanks didn't know that word. :D
I honestly couldn't care less about the naming convention, what I want to know is: what type annotation are you putting on said baby, and will it work with \`mypy --strict\`?
The two hardest problems in computer science...
In the this month Python surpassed JavaScript as the programming language recieving more question per month. Python is also in very steep upward trend since the beggning of 2012.
Seems really cool and I can't wait to see where you take it!! If you want, there's a lot of spelling/grammar errors in comments and code, I can help you clean things up a bit to make them easier to read/understand. There's obviously, of course, a lot of errors, or possible errors, that need to be excepted and I could always politely point them out for you. I'd love to help if you ever need it, either coding, designing, or just keeping things tidy if possible. I don't know, I honestly would absolutely love to help you on this if you want some more hands on deck. If not, I wish you the best of luck my friend and I can't wait to see where you take this! 
I built a small app recently that is customizable notifications for amazon sellers. At first it was just for myself, but as I made it an open source github project (GPL 3) and had since been getting a lot of requests to add features and set it up for use on my digitalocean boxes. It's not cheap to host (twilio + digitalocean + buying domain and DNS service + mail services + my time) so I've been thinking of making a premium version of it to support it, but I'm wondering what the legality of that is if the premium version is based off the free version. I'm also trying to navigate the world of subscriptions and trying to set that up but have had no luck so far :P.
It makes sense. It's a really elegant language. I'm getting some time to work on an independent project of mine in Python and it just reminds me how much I miss working in it.
In this first part, I explore 3 different patterns provided by (py)ZMQ. I explore different ways of acquiring images from a camera, and discuss about the possibilities of each one. 
Alright thanks
When you are saving the file you are most likely not supplying a folder/path which means it'll save to the current working directory (defaulting to the user's home). Either add the directory as a parameter to the script or an environment variable to keep it configurable and then use it when saving (e.g., joining it using os.path.join and then passing that as filename).
The script stores the result in the current working directory. With cron, this is the home directory if not specified otherwise. 
In public, with drugs?
Has anyone studied the correlation between number of questions (as a proxy for popularity) vs. how easy a language is to understand? I’m imagining some hypothetical language which is insanely popular but at the same time so intuitive to code with that it has a fraction of the number of questions as other languages. 
I've used PyCharm for quite a while and really like it.
Visual Studio Code for me. Although I've heard some complaints that it's not good for large projects. 
yeah my problem is it didn't install in my path for some reason so I am not using it. I thinks it's really good, but man I want to know what other options there are. I particularly want to hear from the VIM/Emacs crowd if their solution is sane or not.
Try each one to check how they adecuate to you, but Pycharm works great. Visual Studio is required for a lot of jobs and the new Atom IDE edition is probably a must check also.
Hehe, an alternative point of view is that lots of people are asking questions about python because it is really hard ;) but I don't think that is the case! 
o\_O Visual Studio supports Python? That's weird. I usually use it for C#/C++ &amp;#x200B; ...it looks like you can also run Visual Studio Code on Windows too O\_o, which supposedly also can be used for Python from what I see
Yes. You are right. That's not the case :)
Yep, you can use VSC for almost every language 😊
After some deep lookout I was just being stupid. &amp;#x200B; I ran the command before the engine had time to clean and save anything...so that may have been why it didn't get saved. I feel so stupid now, given it took me a month to figure it out but I finally did it
if you ask me. i would say VS Code. its dope. not just for python, but almost any other language too. i use it for C++/Python/MEAN. try it. 
I wondered the same. Number of questions is really a convolution of usage + difficulty - with usage also being a function of difficulty (and speed, generality etc). This could just be saying that Python is really difficult - though of course that’s not true and the usage would be impacted if it was. But for two languages at are close in question %, it’s not something that should be ignored. 
yeah I saw my friend use it once, apparently it has some hex colour editor so you can easily generate colours and the like when working on .css files or something which I found pretty handy. I am not on Windows atm, but it gets weird for me since why would use Visual Studio Code, over the normal one for C++ or C#? I am on Linux atm if that helps, but I would like a solution for both Windows and OS X. 
Why does anyone care? As long as you can use the language(s) you need to be able to use to get a job, do what you need to do, etc etc - and enough other people are using it so that there’s support - what does it matter whether it’s the most used language or not? Is it a social thing that it means you get to be part of the biggest “club”? Or is it a psychological thing - that it helps justify to yourself your choice of learning said language?
I installed python 3.5 as it supports PyQt5 . Now the issue is , many modules are not supported .
It's pretty basic but definitely can be improved. First, you can use string interpolation for formatting output. You can also use tuples to model the traits. Why? Because tuples are immutable. And all these empty prints... argh. You can use the \`\\n\` character for that,
This language does not exists, and even if it is in the official documentation, there will be a question on stack overflow about it. That's it. [proof 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/761804/how-do-i-trim-whitespace-from-a-python-string) Programming is hard, and you need to read documentation a lot before diving, even with "dumb" languages. String manipulation must be learned to write a program. You must learn it, by the official doc, by a book, a tuto, or by StackOverflow...
Also newness. The older a language is, the greater chance that a google search for your question gets you an answer right away. For a new language, you’d find far fewer answers already. 
i too use it on linux (coz i fucking hate windows). it works great. the colour editor you mentioned. absolutely love it. why use it for C++. well that kind of a choice. you can do all the cool stuff with VS Code. so why not. also you can check the memory blocks when doing C++. that helps. 
Is there a way we can get statistics that show us "number of programs to market made using X programming language?" Would definitely be the definitive stat when looking for "most popular" language. All these stats really confirm is that my college is now pushing Python as *the* language for CS 002 (which is true), and that a lot of people have questions about regex, which is also true. Not dissing these numbers, they're excellent data. Just curious. Also, Swift brothers: rise up!
Would be interesting to compare these results to the results of programming languages like Go or Rust. 
Thus “a fraction” ... obviously you can’t eliminate the majority of noob questions unless some kind of fantastic AI help is built in.
&gt; Pics, links and other things that helped you become good at python? Pictures, seriously? This is programming, not art class. Code is text. We talk about *programming languages* not programming images, and you don't use Photoshop to write code. Useful pictures should be rare, and specialised. **Read code.** Read more code. Read blog posts about code. Read the code in the standard library. Read lots. Then read more. Notice that I didn't specifically say *Python code*. You can learn lots from reading code, or about code, in other languages: different perspectives on how to solve problems, and general algorithms. If you don't like to read, then you'll hate programming. Experiment in the interactive interpreter. When you have a question, "what does list.append do?" say, then **try it in the interpreter** before you ask for help. Use `help(list.append)` and **read what it says**. Read the documentation for list.append. For every line of code you write, you will probably read 200 lines of code or documentation.
Maybe I’m outdated, but I’m having great coding with Emacs
I agree with you, but knowing which language is developing and getting more user base is very important. The community behind the any programming language is the key to its success and growth, which eventually will help new programmers to solve their programming problems. Python is also the language with highest rate of answered questions in stackoverflow. No body wants to sail in a ship alone! new undergraduate students might find such information usefull to their future career. who would waste time learning a language ultimately might never be used again or does no help in finding a job. &amp;#x200B; Such information can be used to check whether the programming are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new project. &amp;#x200B; For instance, python is also now getting more views than any other language in StackOverFlow. Additionally, job postings in Python are in constant increase. 
That's likely impossible as most applications are delivered over HTTP these days
It’s a very simple language if you want to do scripting between systems. Otherwise it gets quite complicated to do what you want 100% of the time. The sheer amount of third party libraries you have to use to make code that is safe and fast is ridiculous. 
I believe you can wire that up yourself via Google BigQuery https://gweb--cloudblog--publish-appspot-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/gcp/google-bigquery-public-datasets-now-include-stack-overflow-q-a/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQECAFYAQ%3D%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s
&gt; Gedit is starting to limit me. What do you find it is missing? Have you tried [Geany](https://www.geany.org/), or [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/)? Kate requires KDE but Geany ought to work fine in Gnome. 
&gt; when not to use lists If you need a number, a string, a true/false flag, an exception, a function... *wink*
There is a lot of discussion about the PEPs in https://discuss.python.org/c/committers giving an idea about different models. A comparison of all models : https://discuss.python.org/t/comparison-of-the-7-governance-peps/392
Interesting perspective I'd like to know more about.. what languages/systems have you worked with have you found do a better job at this?
&gt; A set is O(n) If you're talking about membership testing, that's wrong. In the absence of collisions (which should be pretty rare) both sets and dicts are O(1), lists and tuples are O(n). 
*^(Post has been marked as a duplicate)* *^(Community has voted to close this post as duplicate)*
VS code is an editor, not an IDE. It good for large project if you know how to manage one without a graphical interface, e.g. command line in linux, frameworks and so on. 
Chinamati confirmed. 
AFAIR there's an option somewhere in the PyCharm GUI, that creates .desktop files and scripts. There's also a JetBrains launcher, that also updates installed apps automagically. Another option is to create a script or symbolic link in /usr/local/bin. 
So... Python then? When you compare it to other popular languages I think it's one of the most intuitive. I've used python, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, c#, c++, and elixir. Python was by far the easiest to learn. I definitely imagine c++ gets more questions than python and isn't as popular. 
Python is 5 years older than java, so it's not terribly new.
Agreed about the knowing which language is getting a user base. That’s why my question wasn’t meant as why does anyone care if a language is growing - my question was, why does anyone care if the language is number 1 on the list? 1 or 2 or 3... doesn’t really matter as long as it’s *enough*. 
If you're doing C++, you're probably paid to do it full time. In many cases, I've used python as a helper in my work, alongside CAD software, Excel, C/Fortran compilers, and various other software. So there's a large community of not-primarily-python-hackers that might need more help with python since they just can't spend their whole days in it.
&gt; Nitpick but &gt; &gt; If you need the reversed list itself, use the Python built-in function sorted(... sorted() does not reverse the list. py&gt; values = ["Guido", "Uncle Timmy", "Uncle Barry"] py&gt; values[::-1] # reverse using slicing ['Uncle Barry', 'Uncle Timmy', 'Guido'] py&gt; sorted(values, reverse=True) ['Uncle Timmy', 'Uncle Barry', 'Guido'] I'm sure you know that, but it makes the advice "use `sorted` to reverse a list" a major error, not a minor nitpick. 
You should upgrade to 3.6+. It includes syntax updates so many libraries had to drop support for 3.5 and earlier. May want to also look at PySide2.
If you're under 17, I would recommend checking out the Google Code-In competition. Many of the organizations use Python and there's lots of opportunities for learning and prizes, including a trip to San Francisco for winners! Even if you are older, you can check out the organizations and participate outside of the competition. If you are college aged you can try Google Summer of Code. https://codein.withgoogle.com https//summerofcode.withgoogle.com
Regarding the fact that 90 percent of question cover trivial and well-documented features - I'd rather say that intuitive design is a very subjective thing.
What about PyQt5 ? Will it work ?
Don’t be condescending. I know exactly what I’m doing. I’ve been coding Python and using linux for 10 years now, and this is the best for my use case.
&gt;If you fuck up that environment, you're boned That environment is managed by my system package manager. Every file in there is accounted for. I had exactly two compat problems with this setup in the last 10 years. I fixed one myself (PR to the project, ½h of work), and had to wait a week for the second to be fixed. If I would desperately have needed that second one to work, I could have used a venv, but I didn’t at the time. I know exactly why I’m using this setup, and it’s much nicer than any alternative I’ve tried. &amp;#x200B;
Decent enough blog post, but... &gt; For programmers who haven't seen a Set data type before, it may appear to be of limited use. Who are these programmers who can't imagine testing set membership (`if person in friends: send_invitation()`)? &gt; Key to understanding their usefulness is understanding **their origin in mathematics.** \[Emphasis added.\] For the record, the word "set" in the sense of a collection dates back to the late middle ages, centuries before it was used in mathematics. You don't need 19th century maths to think about items belonging to a set, the overlap (intersection) between sets, or the merging (union) of two sets into one combined set.
I’m not installing anything in there. My system package manager does. I don’t do dev installs. PYTHONPATH is all I need for developing my own packages.
It doesn’t. If you use my style, you *only* install packages into there using the system package manager, so you can’t possibly fuck up the environment. The incompatibility argument is not a good one: I only had that happen twice within 10 years, and if I’d have needed shit to work within less than the week that it took any of those projects to fix their shit, I could have started using virtual environments for that specific case while continuing to use my global environment for everything else.

But it just recently go THIS popular
I love python, but I'm guessing that metric has not filtered out all of the super low quality homework questions.
No capitals. This will make it easier for him to have the same linux and github username, which is a prerequesite to get jupyter hub to work
You probably shouldn't be talking about that here but anyways you need to post the full error log since there should be something more that would explain that problem. P.S. stackoverflow is a great website for asking about errors like this
I mostly learn python checking websites like that instead of books/courses. It has been a weird journey of 5-6 years but to the point: python is so easy that you can rely on that and still learn
In 3.6? Yes. PyQt5 supports 3.5-3.7.
And R devs! 
And R devs! 
API is not an application that can be used with anything. It's an interface, built along some system and tightly connected to it. You cannot create a "standalone API". You could however choose a project that does not have an API, but would be nice if it had one, so external applications could interface with it.
Vim + plugins
Java has way more shitty highschool homework questions though
What I wonder most is what Python version is used. If you compare 2.7 and 3.7 I'd expect the latter to be faster in most cases. 
When I tried installing time module through pip, it says "could not find a version that satisfies the requirement time(from versions: ) No matching distribution found for time"
Getting my head around pandas... 
I second that. PyCharm is a great IDE. I do not want to use anything else.
TL;DR: don't learn a language; learn something to do. It's a big problem u know. Which I faced too btw. Few years ago I wanted to learn html+css, as I did. The last year I entered a university and I'm currently studying SE and ofc they teach us some stuff too. For a school project I tried to learn C++ and I did. For another one tried C# and I'm learning python for 4 months. The point is that I realized my problem was that I wanted to learn a language, and not a "thing to do". If I knew I was going for back-end, or cyber security, or web design or anything I wouldn't be a leaf dancing when the wind blows, but I could be the one who decides. So try to find something u like to do, no matter what. And then you would have a roadmap and there will be choices to be made, instead of confusion. Good luck
There are a lot of factors that go into this question. For instance, I'm limited in the libraries I can install, so I use tkinter. PyQt probably has more choice of widgets. Tkinter might be simpler, PyQt might be nicer-looking. Etc. If you are just learning, try both. In fact, try both anyway and see what constraints turn up.
Thank you, I appreciate your time 🙂.
Okay, so I should pick between categories like back end, front end, data management, games etc. And just find the best language for the one that I pick? 
I was like what? Python 4? :-D

The point is the language or tools doesn't even matter when u know what u wanna do. If u like game dev, you wouldn't think to decide between python, C or C#. When u wanna do front end, u wouldn't think about "what to do now" or try to choose between ruby or JS. Sure there are always "options" for doing anything; but what I mean is knowing "where to go" is more important than "how to go".
Ya, that does make it a smaller field to decide within :) Thanks for your help :) 
I am working on a PiCycle training program similar to what others have already done. After confirming that my training bike had a hall sensor built in, I used a skinned 3.5mm stereo adapter to convert the hall field output (a mono 3.5mm cable that normall plugs into the digital odometer) into a trigger for my Pi. I want to have it control the speed of hd videos on youtube of cycling. So far I have only coded the script to recognize a rotation, calculate distance, speed, and calories based on weight and height. My raspberry pi 3 cannot play hd videos without lag so I am going to have to try and have the pi play nice with my desktop. . .maybe use flask like others who have made Picycle projects have done. I need to create a local server to manage biking statistics and maybe create a game later that is driven by my pedaling. (e.g., a zombie escape game that forces me to pedal faster or have an avatar eaten alive by zombie hordes) It would have been a lot easier with Zwift and CycleOps, but why pay 1000 bucks for a bike adapter and a zwift subscription when I can buy a 110 dollar trainer and a cheap raspberry pi? I also tried to make a cheap python/pi security cam for my attic but the VNC display on my tablet did not display the video feed from pi camera. (We have weasels in our attic and I am looking to determine where there are coming from and possible use the pi to annoy the weasels into leaving.) Traps and commercial ultrasound/strobelights have failed to prevent the weasel incursions.
I love that book. It provides clear examples and has been useful to learn what python can do. So far I have only used that book to rick roll my children. :) So much potential though.
I use Spyder. You may try Jupiter notebook it is good as well
Try WingIDE... if they still have a trial version. 
Visual studio Code
Try sublimetext ...its good 
The confounding factor of an easy programming language attracting more people who are new to programming, and thus ask "obvious" questions that stackexchange doesn't identify as such, or questions related to small variations in version that would be better placed on official forums or git (newbs tend not to know the right channels)
Vs code is the best imo, if you are interestred in Data Science pick Jupyter Notebook 
I have to wander why would it need to in pip directly? It could be implemented as a separate package that extends pip but doesn't create a new pip altogether like pipenv. Then any tool that wants to be a plugin to pip can just relay on that package instead of pip directly. Yes it could be kind of hacky to do that but if pip development is so slow then ether we wait for pip to get features that other language package managers havad 4 years ago or we get around pip slow process all together.
I never said it was. The context of my comment is what factors influence the number of questions. And the newness (a range spanning from the very newest to the very oldest) is another factor. It’s like `brightness` — it doesn’t mean that something is bright since it’s possible to have zero brightness. 
Visual studio (not code) with python is a beast!
Large systems are easier to maintain with static typing. I was listening to a podcast where they talked about having a Python linter and how that let them rename a variable across hundreds of files in less than five minutes since they could change the variable, run the linter, and find all the places they still had to change. I had to chuckle because, in a static language, you simply rename the variable in one place and, thanks to static analysis, 100% of all other uses are updated in seconds. Zero effort. I know there are bolt-on solutions for Python (mypy etc.) but that’s one of the biggest things I wish Python had out of the box. 
Which is insane because a ton of them are data science related
Yeah bro. It's like, what is the admixture of hyperparameters, right? 
I now Unreal Engine
Yes, but python gets chosen more and more for teaching new students. Java used to be a go-to language for that, now python competes a lot in that regard. Can't backup this claim, don't have a link, but I read it somewhere a couple of months ago.
It's worth considering learning VIM at some point (Janus will make it a bit more IDE-like). It's got quite a learning curve, but you'll be comfortable knowing you can program efficiently under the worst of conditions, anytime, anywhere. I started with it because Atom was crashing my ye olde desktop, and I was also doing some programming via ssh. New desktop, and I still use it, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.
I've read about unreal engine. I really would like to stick with python because it's "simple."
As always in programming: it depends. For very (and I mean very) simple engines, python might be enough but typical I would recommend using a language that is better for such computationally intensive tasks like C++.
This is a nice problem that I think there's value in even experienced coders putting a little bit of time to explicitly try it out - it's quite straightforward overall and uses very well-known techniques (a stack), but has a couple of potential 'gotchas' if you just don't *quite* think it through. I ran into one of those in my first attempt, that the video's solution is resilient against but doesn't test for: extra closing parens, like in `']'` would have caused my initial code to throw an error rather than properly return False. This also shows the importance of having a good set of test cases. It's flagged as an interview question, and in my opinion, this seems several million percent better than 'fizzbuzz' as a way to separate people who can actually code from people who can memorise answers to interview questions. That said, the video's solution is.. odd. For one, it inspects `stack[-1]` then if it's right calls `stack.pop` and ignores the result - I think it makes more sense to pop first and check based on the return value. Also using a dictionary to define what closing character you expect is shorter, more extensible and in my experience easier to follow than having lots of little conditional functions like `isSquare` and `isRound`. Also also, camel case function names aren't preferred in Python. This is my approach: expect = {'[':']', '(':')', '{':'}'} def balance_check(test): stack = [] for char in test: if char in expect: stack.append(expect[char]) else: try: pair = stack.pop() except IndexError: return False else: if char != pair: return False return not stack assert balance_check("([])[]({})") assert not balance_check("([)]") assert not balance_check("((()") 
Oh sorry!
Use the PySide2 official bindings. 
I'll check out both unreal and c++
Doing data science or web dev or devops scripts? Data science - use spyder Web dev? Use pycharm / visual Devops? Vim /emacs/ gedit
No unreal is cool, I'm just so biased for python. With unreal, I wouldn't have to start from scratch and plus its used in AAA titles Thanks for the recommendation.
VsCode not ide. This is editör?
&gt; it helps justify to yourself your choice of learning said language There's another way to look at it: this is the language of choice for newbies. If you're no longer a newbie, why would you brag about these stats?
&gt; Which is insane because a ton of them are data science related Makes sense, because most data scientists are beginners when it comes to programming.
Have you heard the good news about Godot? It has a built in scripting language that's very similar to Python. And if that's not good enough, you can use actual python through in-engine bindings! Or any language you possibly want to use! 
I think, the good support (libaries, books, tutorial) for Machine learning is the reason for it. 
You might have just saved my life. Thanks!
I'm in the VIM crowd, my solution is sane! I used Janus to take the bulk of the setup work out of VIM, and added some Python plugins. That gave me syntax highlighting with more colour schemes than you want, tab completion, snippets, git integration, code linting, shortcuts to run code and add breakpoints, go to defintion, Python Docs inside VIM with search, plus some other useful Python shortcut keys. I use neovim to have a terminal pane in VIM. Finally I added a couple of lines to my vimrc so I have shortcuts to run tests. Just from VIM you get "native" VIM keys support and all the glorious power that provides, you'll miss it everywhere else. Plus you don't need a GUI or mouse to work, don't need a powerful machine for it to run quickly, it loads instantly, you can customize it, extend it, and it's free. On the downside, the learning curve is infamous and you'll become frustrated the Caps Lock key isn't Escape. I used PyCharm for years, then Atom for a year, but now I'll stick to VIM, and xmodmap that Caps Lock to Escape. Oh, and you can run Python in VIM to edit your text: http://www.paulbrownmagic.com/blog/power_of_vim
I really thought JS would keep that mantle considering the sense that it's just eating into everything and has always, at least to me, felt much less intuitive than Python. I hope this correlates to more Python usage and excitement around the language
well done, looking forward to more zmq stuff.

I guess it depends on what you mean by homework. Every institution I've been to, heard of, or learned at focused on C++, C#, or Java. Html/JavaScript/php as web languages. They were behind the curve because they were focused on what had the most careers in it and were of course giant, slow pieces of bureaucracy that have no chance of pushing that curve if they wanted to. Programs like LaunchCode (good program, but there are many that aren't good) go for these languages that have a lower barrier for entry. They constantly stick with what is hot and modern. Those programs often leave you with a rough and or narrow view of the language with hardly any supporting knowledge. Combine that with the fact that it **is** hot and taking over where a lot of other languages are starting to fail, it doesn't surprise me that we see a ton of questions on it.
Python3.6 has a type declaration syntax. Given that plus the fact that flow typing is all the rage in JS now, I think that reinforces the point you have made above. People want static typing/enforcement for most projects.
Bear in mind Qt is only free for open source projects, otherwise you get a free trial and then pay per developer. Tk is free and open-source, so you can use it for anything without paying. When it comes to libraries, always check the licenses, you'll have to honour them.
Thank you so much!😊
Would love you have ya. I suck at spelling so it was expected to see grammar errors on my end. Jump in the discord run and we can talk. https://discord.gg/DupBCm5
I’m not sure that would be a definitive stat. I mean plenty of people will use Python or similar for prototyping a project, then rewrite in a more production focussed language. You’d miss that fact using that stat. 
Ok sorry, but with the python plugin works well
r/learnpython
Haha so true. I had to explain to one of our data scientists that it was better to hit our API using his specific job id than to retrieve the whole list of 7 million and parse through it with Python. Cut his run time down from a few minutes to a few seconds.
I personally find tkinter a lot easier to use. PyQT does look better tho. 
If you'd like to learn a new library and not write console apps in Python look into gui libraries like tkinter. Try making a gui based web scraper or something kinda difficult like that and you'll learn a lot. 
PySide2 (QT for python) is LGPL
Tkinter has the advantage of being in stdlib so it will work without any additional dependencies. I never delved much into GUI but my impression was that Tk had an older design carrying more legacy, you could style an application to look "modern" in latest Tk versions but it had a bit of additional effort. I also remember there's a *Modern Tkinter* book, but I never read it. You may want to have a look at it.

I think we can easily say that low level languages are the most difficult ones, but they don't get as many questions as python (or have lower ratio of question per popularity.). So the effect of popularity seems to determine the amount of questions more.
The only issue is that the 3D part of the engine isn't *great*. It doesn't have good occlusion culling (yet), and the real time lighting stuff tends to lag, so the performance won't be as good as other engines. But other than that it's such a joy to work in.
Thank you, I appreciate your time!🙂
Thank you, for your honest opinion!🙂
Thank you for your time!🙂
I think Python has a few problems for beginners, mainly with the documentation. The documentation is so terse as to be nearly useless and it's organization is terrible. It's one step above a `dir(x)` followed by `x.foo.__doc__` and it's occasionally just missing things that you'd find with object introspection. Further, the doc is split between the Library and the Tutorial, and there's no rhyme or reason for what is where. Say I want to know what methods a list has, or maybe I want to know how to use `list.index()`. I should look in the library reference for list right? Well, [there's information there](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#list) but the only method listed is `list.sort()`. Meanwhile, just below, [string does list a bunch of methods](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). Okay, how about the Tutorial? No, that's just [basic list information](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/introduction.html#lists). Oh, wait, there's *another* page with [more information on lists](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) -- literally called More On Lists -- that actually shows the methods. Worse, *none of these pages refer to each other.* The list is the most basic, fundamental data structure in Python, yet it's documented differently in three different places? That's not good. Compare this to C#. You search for "C# list," and you're taken to [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netcore-2.2). It's complete, comprehensive, has non-trivial examples, each page documents exactly what arguments it accepts and returns and all their types, overloads are explicitly defined, and everything that could be hyperlinked is hyperlinked. 
Or in undergrad
Also, ask yourself the question: Do you really want to create a native-running GUI app? In a lot of cases writing a web app does the trick. The advantages of having your app running a web based GUI compared to native are many
Next weekend could get interesting...thanks for sharing!
&gt; you simply rename the variable in one place and, thanks to static analysis, 100% of all other uses are updated in seconds. Could you elaborate more on that or give a link that talks about it? I'm curious how it works.
Well, I am not much familiar with this. So, it would be of great help if you elaborate "native-running GUI app" and "web-based GUI" as well as their pros and cons. Btw, thank you 🙂.
Yeah there are a lot of low effort questions, that's true for any language on SO, but I think Python's popularity as a "beginner language" make it especially bad (that's just my unscientific opinion from browsing and answering questions on there). 
Sounds like a learning exercise for you, in which case it does not matter, just do it. If you are being serious then no, it is not suitable.
I suggest going with tkinter and learning about event driven programming. Lynda has a good course, if you like learning by video. &amp;#x200B; Python 2.7 included several demonstration programs. (Not sure what Python 3 has) [https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/2.7/Demo/tkinter](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/2.7/Demo/tkinter) Python 3 [https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) Event Driven Programming [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven\_programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) [http://eventdrivenpgm.sourceforge.net/](http://eventdrivenpgm.sourceforge.net/)&lt;= See the pdf [http://www.alan-g.me.uk/l2p/tutevent.htm](http://www.alan-g.me.uk/l2p/tutevent.htm) Tkinter Resource links [http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html](http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html) [https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Introduction\_to\_GUI\_Programming.html](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Introduction_to_GUI_Programming.html) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
**Event-driven programming** In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input. This is also true of programming for device drivers (e.g., P in USB device driver stacks). In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events, and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
What is not working? PyCharm is a fantastic tool, and does a very good job of dealing with Python. I would fix whatever is causing your problem before changing IDE?... seems like a strange move.
If you're creating an app with a gui you have the option of writing it as an executable that's compiled for a certain OS, with either TKinter och PyQt. But you can also create a web application where the GUI is the browser.
On point, OP you are making busy work for yourself. If you want to learn then pursue a formal education. If you want to do, then pick a project that you are passionate about, or a project that you have funding to do, and just do it.
Yeah, I would say it's a learning experience. I've used python to make a 2d platformer years ago. I never finished it though. Gonna help a buddy with making an engine for his game. We're both not professionals but I think that we can get the job done with a little trial and error. 
Triple that, PyCharm is quality and plug and play, you will be much more productive and quicker out the gate.

What IDE are you using?
Thanks!
Here's a little program to get you started. It creates a simple bar chart. [Gist For Bar Chart](https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/fd79baad627ae879bb74437427ad4ff0) [Window it produces](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/50095697-118aef80-01e4-11e9-85eb-9ea6baa57352.png) I think one of the coolest graph features is that you define your own coordinate system. That made this one super easy. I made (0,0) the bottom left corner, and (500,500) the upper right. Then I just drew rectangles with sizes that match a random value. You can fit your data to the window easily this way. It's decoupled from the (w,h) of the widget you're drawing the graph inside. The widget size may only be [100 x 100 pixels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/50096168-156b4180-01e5-11e9-8dab-06695fd8b19a.png) and it still works.
so you work and do other projects.. I'm guessing projects for programming and you can't spend 30 minutes doing a rock paper scissors game? Literally that's all it would take someone new to write that. I could knock it out in 5 minutes. 
Its posted like once a week on this sub..
I had written up a long comment about your post on r/learnpython but my browser borked itself before I could submit it. Essentially I'd confirmed the behavior dating back to ~numpy 1.7 (I've forgotten now, but whichever version introduced the "where" argument) and after looking into the source itself, I'd basically reached the conclusion /u/calebyh commented upon.

Take the zero. If you can, do it and turn it in late, otherwise accept that this is a zero. If that's too much, drop the course. One assignment is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. And a course you don't want to put effort into isn't worth your time, or worth wasting the teachers time. There's also google. 
Well, technically... if you want to be understood literally... there isn't such thing as Python IDE. The `I` in IDE stands for "integrated", which means that compiler / interpreter and possibly debugger and similar tools are *built into the editor*. That's not what happens in all kinds of PyCharm / VSCode / Vim / Emacs. Every such editor is designed to be extensible. It may be hosting Python interpreter or talking to an external process or maybe none of that at all... Examples of proper IDEs are few and far in between. For example Eclipse with EJC is an IDE, but nobody really uses it that way, anyone using Java would probably set up Eclipse to compile using an external JDK. So, you are not actually looking for an IDE, you are looking for an editor capable of dealing with Python. But, believe it or not, the fact that you are dealing with Python is secondary if not tertiary to this question. It is more important to answer questions like: - Are you working on big or small projects? - Many projects at a time or mostly the same project all the time? - Many people on the team or mostly it's you alone / you and a few co-workers? - Do you need to be able to easily reproduce your working environment on a different computer, different platform, over network? - What other tasks are common in your work? Do you need to use command line a lot? Do you need to use graphic interfaces? - Do you, basically, want to show off some cool features of your editor, but you don't care that much about productivity (you have a lot of spare time), or would you rather just have things done. - How much effort are you willing to invest into learning how your tools work? Just to give you some common profiles: 1. Django developer hired to do a bit of front-end, a bit of back-end, basically supports a back-office system of some e-commerce site. No good knowledge or interest in infrastructure. No reason to replicate working environment (just do work on office computer during office hours). This kind of person would be very satisfied with using PyCharm or VSCode. They kind of look pretty. Not very useful to get things done, but they allow a lot of sloppiness for a, basically, eternal beginner, who isn't interested in improving their skills (they'd rather save up for a great vacation abroad). 2. UI tester who can script some Selenium-based automation. Overwhelmed by the complexity and obscurity of setup of tools like PyCharm or VSCode. However, needs to produce text documents describing their work, would rather prefer something that's comfortable to type, on a system they know well. So, something like Notepad++ would work great. 3. Embedded or system developer, who mostly writes in C, maybe some Assembly or, if they are lucky, Rust and such. Usually working through some kind of remote connection, on all sorts of weird systems where nothing works as you'd expect, and certainly no X-server or not even a display-manager. Vim might be a good choice here, but Emacs would work well too. 4. Statistician who likes LaTeX and wants to keep a journal of how they arrived to the conclusions in their thesis, who wants it ready for print and for publishing on web: definitely Emacs.
Godot is a great modern-ish engine with a python like scripting experience... for actual python in a serviceable 3D game engine, there is also Panda3d. It fits your requirement as stated. It’s a bit dated, but still useful for a wide variety of games. Note that it does not have an editor. Python is the primary interface...

This is actually a good question, just a shame you've phrased it so antagonistically! 
Think I found a bug in the Winning Governance: &gt;[Term](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/#id10) &gt; &gt;A new council is elected after each feature release. The council can reject all the PEPs, therefore no feature release will come out, therefore the council can last forever and block the language evolution. I can see the evil Pascal community infiltrating in the council just to make Python as old and dead as Pascal. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you!🙂
&gt;For one, it inspects stack[-1] then if it's right calls stack.pop and ignores the result - I think it makes more sense to pop first and check based on the return value. Yeah, I think you're right about this. The format I'm using in these videos doesn't give me a lot of time to think through the absolute best way of coding something though. I want the first time I see the problem to be the first time the viewer sees the problem with me. I also don't want to give myself the benefit of hindsight, or editing, or re-recording because I feel that's a bit dishonest to the real nature of programming (iterating on a better and cleaner solution after coming up with a working one), particularly in these interview settings. As for your solution, I don't think using exception handling for control flow is the best idea. Other than that, it's great! and much cleaner than mine.
Just playing devil's advocate (and on things I really do not know much about). Isn't the beauty of open source, especially with the permissive license of python, that it can be forked if this happens? I mean, we're in this mythical non-benevolant world of course so there will be pain either way, but it isn't like it is locked forever and ever. 
Why JS is so popular? Im not sure but i thought its only used in web development
Two solutions: 1. the PEP also describes a '[Vote of no confidence](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/#id15)' mechanism to let the core developers jettison the council. 2. I think a feature release (a new x.y.0 release) could come out despite having no accepted PEPs. It would be a very boring release that's more like a bugfix release, with just bug fixes and minor enhancements that weren't deemed to need a PEP, but it would still count to dissolve the council. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I learned from an Esri book, Learning Python for ArcGIS. My last job paid for an Esri training class, but that wasn't as helpful as having the book. For GIS libraries that work with more open-source software, I don't know, but /r/gis is probably a good place to look for resources.
Makes sense. I love Python because it's pretty easy to read compared to other languages. (Perl is also easy to read) Plus there's less to stop newbies because it doesn't need to be compiled. With more people and more newbies, there'll be more questions.
That plus its also been a pretty common choice for many of the introductory programming MOOCs that have become so popular.
&gt; Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: sort While not the most visible, they do link to the documentation of .index right there.
PyQT gives you great options for plug and play. For instance, you have the QT designer packaged with Anaconda, so you can always design the GUI and link the widgets/buttons/etc... to directly connect into functions. Easy. However, I've [personally] found pyQT to have a lot of problems when wrapping it up into an .exe file. So, if that's important, I'd shy away. 
Thank you!🙂
Definitely PyQt. It's far more professional looking. Tk is just plain ugly. Tk is built-in assuming you didn't unclick the box when installing it, but in 2018, getting packages like PyQt isn't hard in the slightest. The biggest conceptual difference is PyQt's signal-slot system takes some getting used to. Tk works on a callback system. It seems more intuitive to start, but Qt's is far more flexible and sane.
Thank you for your time!🙂

Global Interpreter Lock. It’s CPython specific, though 
Global Interpreter Lock. It’s CPython specific, though
Where I work, everything on the systems side is C++.. But they aren't exactly using Stack Overflow to answer their questions because they're not dealing with the simple problems that that forum handles but rather with more complex micro-optimizations that few companies in the world even care about.
Nice work. ZMQ is my network/message pasing library of choice when I have control over both sockets.
I'm gonna forkin' push that over to my giftlab
No problem man, best of luck. Remember I used to think I need to know 100% of Python to accomplish something, but it turns out you just need to get to 20% mark and pick up the rest along the way with time. Cheers.
There is a library called \[ReportGen\]([https://pypi.org/project/reportgen/](https://pypi.org/project/reportgen/)) that can be used for PDF work
Things can always be forked, but that fork then needs enough traction to actually replace the incumbent project. With something as large as Python, that'd be difficult 
For the most part it is, but it's finding a place in mobile app development with React Native, which is a JS framework.
Can you expand a bit on Emacs a bit more? Why does a statistician want to use Emacs? I know that they I personally use either Texmaker/Texstudio to handle my Latex needs. I don't see why I would need to spend time setting up TeX for Emacs.
I understand there's a general consensus on which languages are easier, but that's still technically a subjective quality. Would be difficult to measure objectively. 
Yep there’s not much I do professionally that will have an answer on SO. 
Yes that's also part of it. Questions on SO have limitations with respect to their scope and difficulty. So not every problem will be asked on SO.
The Node ecosystem is massive and keeps expanding. Much to my chagrin. Fortunately there are languages like CoffeeScript and PythonScript that compile to JS and are less frustrating to work with for me. 
Just try Jetbrains Idea for Java or Kotlin. It really works. However, to some extent PyCharm can do the same with your Python unless some dynamic magic is involved. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand that such easy refactoring comes with price. Dynamic code enables less boilerplate preventing in the same time IDE to reason about your code properly.
I just use a lot of DSLs that nobody is asking about on SO. If I want to figure out why something is behaving unexpectedly, I have to crack open the parser myself or find the developer who wrote it. 
r/programminghorror
Nah man I’m talking DSLs like Puppet’s language, Terraform’s HCL, etc. well-documented, just barely on SO. 
to fix your issue change your crontab to the following: 15 8 * * * cd /home/ec2-user/aws/ &amp; python run.py
Aren't there loads of python packages not on pacman, though? I know I've released some PyPI packages and not bothered to put them on any system package managers. Largely because the recommended dev workflow doesn't use them.
&gt;number of programs to market made using X programming language? I would suggest `count of git repos` as a viable proxy. Probably with some sort of constraints like `repos owned by organizations, not individual users`, or `repos with monthly commit count &gt; x` , or `repos with LOC &gt; x`, etc. Some interesting opportunities for unique analysis.
So if your IDE supports it, you c make this kind of change. How is this different from adding linter support to VS Code and getting the exact same results? 
Also tried installing channel_finder using pip It says "could not find a version that ..." (Let me know if you want to know all text)
Actually, the most you really have to do is change calls from "tk." to "ttk." 
Any (functional) programming language with algebraic types and pattern matching helps tremendously. This is of course only part of it and it really depends on what kind of program you want to develop. \- Business applications are done extremely well in Haskell and F#, or any kind of workflow modelling in general. \- If you want to do web-assembly, networking or something closer to the OS layer then Rust is an excellent choice. \- Julia is a great new language for scientific computing (from data analysis to machine-learning). \- You may want to check other languages as well such as Elixir or Elm for web-development

It takes like 5 minutes to wrap them
"How can I data science with python"
It is a telegram related module
Don’t forget that a lot of people are using Python for so much more than “programs to market.” Examples: Scientists, IT admins, accountants
Right. 5 minutes for pacman. 5 minutes for apt. 5 minutes for portage. 5 minutes for RPM. Snap, flatpak, appimage... all of this adds a great deal of maintenance overhead to appease the very few people who refuse to follow the recommended dev workflow. Now, don't get me wrong, if you're installing (or developing) a single standalone python-based application, as someone making GUI tools for biologists might do (also my line of work), a system package manager is a fine choice. But that's not what most python devs are doing.

Qt is LGPL these days, but PyQt is the difficulty as it's GPL.
No, I mean I'm wrapping everything I need just for Pacman/Arch if it's not available and upload it to the central user repository (AUR). That's all I need for development, and I can do it very quickly.
I don't feel this is a valid metric, but i'm glad to see more people learning about python regardless.
Maybe an obvious question but what package would you use to develop a web GUI? I’m guessing you’d need to have somewhere to host it, but then developing the GUI would be done.... how?

Yes, thank you for saying this! I've tried learning python as a hobby twice and man is it frustrating! At the time I only had matlab as programming experience but boy do they have the best documentation! Every time I landed on a python docs page to figure out how some syntax worked it felt like reading a thesis, not even an article! That or being hit on the head with a brick. With so many people claiming its the easiest language in the world to learn (I'm over exaggerating) I've felt really frustrated and daft trying to learn python. Have since learned javascript (jQuery, beginner nodejs and rudimentary D3js) and it's so much simpler. Matlab really nice to learn too! 
I’m fairly new to coding so while it may be easy for someone else, I’m finding it incredibly difficult so far
I would drop the course, but I won’t be graduating this year if I fail or drop a single course
Yup, C++ was the language we used for undergrad. Python is my hobbyist language. C++ is my work language.
Practice, practice, practice! Code excercises help a bit, but the best way to learn is to make real programs. Especially if you can finish them. It's good if they scratch an itch you have. It doesn't matter if it's original or full-featured or fancy. Publish your code online, for example on GitHub, so others can see your code and offer suggestions. Once you're more confident, you can contribute to open source projects.
Questions could be about finer details. Like list comprehensions blew my mind when I first came across them. No more nasty nested for-if loops. Just a single, clean, one/two liner.
Beginning to learn Python! (It's also why I joined Reddit in the first place lol for the community)
Thank you sir, that's a great start, I'll go digging!
how do you expect to do a job if you are paying people to do your homework? Going to go through life paying for people to do your job? Honestly sit down for 30 minutes and try and post questions about why something in your code doesn't work
I don't know the reason behind your problem, but have you tried limiting the lifetime of your celery workers? http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#max-tasks-per-child-setting Might be a bit of a workaround if you can't figure out the actual issue? 
You could do `if not stack: return False` instead of catching the exception, but keep in mind that asking for forgiveness rather than permission is very much the python way - and using exceptions for control flow has a strong precedent, being built into the iterator protocol.

Microsoft's documentation on .NET is top tier in my opinion. Very few languages have such comprehensive documentation :) I'm a C# fan/dev btw
Mine looks like so and does not need exception handling: expect = {"(":")","[":"]","{":"}"} def wellformed(string): stack = [] for char in string: if char in expect.keys(): stack.append(char) elif char in expect.values(): if len(stack) &lt; 1 or expect[stack.pop()] != char: return False return not stack print(wellformed("([])[]({})")) # True print(wellformed("([)]")) # False print(wellformed("((()")) # False **Motivation:** * I prefer a clear distinction between dict `keys()` and `values()` to just the `in` check in the solution by /u/lvc_ * Lazy evaluation circumvents IndexError (second part of OR is never reached if first is true): &amp;#8203; if len(stack) &lt; 1 or expect[stack.pop()] != char: * Also allow to handle things like the following (only nesting of brackets matters) &amp;#8203; print(wellformed("{([()something])()}")) # True &amp;#x200B;
No, python just in the last two day surpassed JS to become the language with the most questions per month.. this metric just got updated. 
Try [pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview) 
Emacs has `org-mode`, this allows you to integrate a lot of things you'd use for something like a research paper / journal / schedule. So, you can have a table editor connected to you favorite five scripting languages, connected to your task management, hyperlinked, with a lot of navigation and management shortcust, and it can export to a bunch of formats, LaTeX being just one of them, other formats include HTML, plain text and with various degree of support, ODT, Markdown, ReStructured Text and a bunch of others. Here are few of my ancient examples from the time I was trying to complete my CS degree :) https://github.com/wvxvw/intro-to-automata-theory/blob/master/assignment-12.pdf https://github.com/wvxvw/uni-introduction-to-statistics/blob/master/assignment-11.pdf https://github.com/wvxvw/uni-linear-algebra-1/blob/master/2014/assignment-11.pdf But GitHub's rendering of PDF isn't really good... when it comes to math. This doesn't really illustrate the full potential. https://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-MIT-Press/dp/0262162091 this book was written in `org-mode` for example. And there are a bunch more. I remember Odersky wash showing Scala compiler compilation and a bunch of other stuff, which was all done in `org-mode`.
Oh, I won't argue with that. The .Net documentation was definitely as lopsided a comparison I could make, but if you're not familiar with just how amazing it is it's hard to see where Python sits relatively.

What are your thoughts about my solution? Not that I deem exception handling bad but I love using lazy evaluation to get around superfluous cases. For me it is easier to read, feels more natural and is still correct.
Oh you can use your package manager, that's no problem. You can also install pip from your package manager. I've never had a use case for get-pip.py. You might be using Ubuntu based on apt-get, the package should be called python3-pip I believe. Similar on Debian, I'm sure
That's true. I've always felt that for a language that is constantly touted as beginner friendly the docs are pretty complicated and hard to understand. Completely agree on the importance of the lopsided comparison in that case.
Thanks, it's got a good chance of being effective. I just worry that the trigger for this issue isn't a function of time (or number of tasks completed) alone. That's something I guess I need to figure out. 
&gt;The council can reject all the PEPs, therefore no feature release will come out I think, in this drastic case, it would be easier than you think. The difficulty will lie in the splintering and seeing if those splinters can cooperate/consolidate.
&gt;I just worry that the trigger for this issue isn't a function of time (or number of tasks completed) alone Yeah the switch from running fine for months to hitting some weird condition around 12 hours sounds like it is something else. I could've *sworn* there was a time-based limit option on Celery workers (and Python [multiprocessing.pool.Pool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool) workers...) :( oh well...

Sorry I don't actually use python - only a lurker here to keep up with it somewhat. Good news is, it doesn't appear to be too hard: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=python+active+directory+authentication Consider this example from the first StackOverflow link: import win32security token = win32security.LogonUser( username, domain, password, win32security.LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK, win32security.LOGON32_PROVIDER_DEFAULT) authenticated = bool(token)
I think the warning is for the cautious. If you have a fresh install of Ubuntu (and therefore Python 2.7 and 3.x depending on the Ubuntu version), there should be no trouble using the script. An alternative way of getting pip on Ubuntu would be using apt `apt install python-pip` or if you want the Python 3 pip `apt install python3-pip` Once you have pip, I recommend using virtualenv for a clean isolated envionment in which you can play. Or when your project evolves, even use Pipenv for a more clear and convenient way of using pip in a virtuelenv, look here: [https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)

AP CS uses java because its a compiled language that is cross platform. C# would be a great language for AP CS but it’s only on Windows. I love Python, but it’s an interpreted language that’s dynamically typed. Those attributes make it great as a first language but people also need to learn about compiled languages that are statically typed. I think that the AP CS curriculum would ideally consist of a semester of Python and a semester of Java. That would expose high schoolers to interpreted and compiled languages while also exposing them to both dynamically and statically typed languages.
/r/learnpython But I'll bite. Basically, you want a function which takes a row, does your processing and filtering, and submits your output. Then you want to use a `multiprocessing.Pool` to `map` the function to your dataframe. Like this: ```python import multiprocessing as mp def process_row(row): filtered = filter_my_data(row) submit_response = submit_my_data(filtered) return row, submit_response with mp.Pool() as p: results = p.map(process_row, my_dataframe.itertuples(), chunksize=len(my_dataframe)//mp.cpu_count()) ``` Note also the use of itertuples - it's better for keeping data types correct and probably pickles better than a dataframe does.
/u/hanpari is getting downvoted, I guess for not providing an actual answer but he is right. Let me try. In statically typed languages (indeed, like Java, but also C, C++, Rust, and way more) due to the nature of the compilation the compiler needs to know a lot more about the code. For instance, in Python on runtime objects are typically represented by a dict-like structure. When you reach for `object.x`, it will look up the string `"x"` in the dict represented by the object. In Javascript it's even very typical to simply use an empty JS object `{}` as a basis for a dict. This sort of stuff is not allowed in statically typed languages. When you access a field (`object.x`) it needs to know ahead of time where `x` sits in that object. The object, on runtime, is just a continuous block of memory (a byte array). All objects from the same class will always be the exact same size. `x` may sit at byte 4 from the start of the object. If `x` is a 32-bit (4-byte) integer, the next field will sit at byte 8, and so on. When the compiled code is dealing with `object.x`, it will use the direct address of `object` in memory, add to it the offset that it knows from compilation (4 bytes in this case) and directly reach for that location in memory. This is faster, saves memory, but does require extensive knowledge exactly about which field is being used. It needs to know, when compiling access to `object.x`: - the class of `object` - the offset of `x` in the object If either of these are missing or ambigious, it simply _can't_ compile the code. There's no substitute, no hack around this. This means that, by the very nature of the language, you can always ask for and get a 100% definitive answer of the places where this field `x` is being used.
Nowadays I use pyenv to manage all my python versions. It's safer than relying on the package manager, since you won't get surprised by a system-wide update breaking your code, and you can also get newer releases sooner.
i think it's the first cause many non cs students are trying to learn it ( easy to learn, clear syntax, and many ads on YouTube / google ) so maybe most of the questions are basic syntax questions like : " how to create a function in python " or algorithm questions like " how do i sort an array in python ". Just my opinion.
If you want to do it yourself this video is pretty good - https://youtu.be/XQgXKtPSzUI Uses beautifulSoup and is pretty straight forward. The example demonstrated is new egg but it is transferable
How?! Its so condensed compared to c++ and Java. Although i guess theres also alot of libraries for python so maybe the questions are library specific?
This seems nice. I wish I had seen your comment before I decided to compile mine.
&gt; I’m imagining some hypothetical language which is insanely popular but at the same time so intuitive to code with that it has a fraction of the number of questions as other languages. I don't think that would ever happen. The easier a language is to understand, the more that non-programming minded people will attempt to use it. And these people are fairly likely to ask a question. I think a better metric would be number of "complex" questions about a language. "Complex" questions would be anything that wasn't about syntax, a prominent/fundamental language feature (eg list comprehensions and iterators in Python would be a prominent feature, but something like import hooks wouldn't be considered prominent/fundamental because the average programmer will never need them). Such a metric would essentially weed out every question that is answered in tutorials or just cursory glances at documentation, and then you could see whether the language being easy to understand helped people solve complicated questions on their own.
But it can be a problem. Found the hard way. This is also true for pip. See here: [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5599](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5599) &amp;#x200B; &gt; **Only ever use your system package manager to upgrade the system pip**. The system installed pip is owned by the distribution, and if you don't use distribution-supplied tools to manage it, you will hit problems. Yes, we know pip says "you should upgrade with pip install -U pip" - that's true in a pip-managed installation, ideally distributions should patch this message to give appropriate instructions in the system pip, but they don't. &amp;#x200B; So installing via package manager and via other methods ( say compiling) result in potentially differences. It all feels like a strange mess. 
Strong typing combined with static typing make it harder for students to make stupid, hard to catch errors in their code, which can make it easier to learn for some people.
I don't know, it feels like if I wanted to handle to-dos or stuff like that there are dedicated programs like Wunderlist that have great defaults out of the box, with Emacs and even VIM it seems like you have to spend so much time setting things up instead of getting down to getting work done. Like I guess you could try to apply the Latex analogy where once you learn it, it makes writing mathematical papers and different research papers and printed works a bit easier. But it just feels like a big waste of time having to configure all your packages and trying to get the right modes.

You're right. I was deliberately only focusing inward in this post. Perhaps I should have used a different title: "state of the Python language, its libraries and key tools, and how these will hopefully change in 2019" is not as catchy. There are quite a bit of posts talking about how great Python is for many applications. They are almost all really enjoyable. I like those talks at PyCon - one of my favourites from a few years ago was about picking companies to invest in and evaluating a strategy on historical data; a good one from this year was about detecting exoplanets. I wouldn't mind reading a compendium of these, but it's not really my forte. I use Python in a fairly traditional way (see my own PyCon talk for details), so my perspective on the "outward face" is much more boring than some. In the future, I would like to see someone write a post like the one you describe.
Don’t look for a “Python” developers job! Look for a position where you can use Python. Frankly for most full time work you will need to know technologies other than Python. Also you didn’t mention your full time work but you might be able to leverage knowledge gained there by looking for allied developers positions. 
A decent chunk of this is due to Pandas, which is a horribly confusing library to use. Just pandas itself makes up for about 1.8% of questions which is really unbelievable. I wouldn't be surprised at all if Python tanks in the next 10 years as there is tremendous room for a better-designed high-level language.
I guess the difference in what I do is that I'm always in a virtual environment, I can't say I've ever used the system pip to do anything. I typically have a virtual environment and update pip in there

impressive.
You don’t need to use a ‘set’ to test for membership like ‘if person in friends’. Any iterable will do (you could do this with a list, of course). If all a set was good for was to do constant time membership operations, they wouldn’t be very useful...
I’d still use pyenv to install anaconda. 
pyenv compiles them too, it’s not too late to switch
Ok here it goes, I'm doing this code review on my phone so sorry about the typos. ``` First I would add a config action for the json argument. It will give you more consistent argument error messages. class JsonAction(argparse.Action): """ Custom action that gets json """ def __call__(self, parser, namespace, value, option_string=None): #i think argparse will catch deserialization erros so no try except value = {"Filter": json.loads(value)} setattr(namespace, self.dest, value) #use this class in you __main__ args.add_argument('--filter','-f', action"JsonAction, default="{}" help="JSON formatted string to filter Snapshots") # separator this code isn't in order def main(args): """"Deletes snapshots based on arguments The reason the description goes here is the main function will have an __doc__ variable that will contain this string. It is used by ipython and ides to tell what the function does to the user. """" session = boto3.Session(profile_name=args.profile) ec2 = session.client('ec2') #because we put Filter in the dict when a json arg is passed in and default to an empty dict we can remove the if statement and just use ** snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(**args.filter) delete_snapshots = [] if args.age is not None: output("Deleting any snapshots older than "+str(args.age)+" days", "", args) delete_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=args.age) for snapshot in snapshots["Snapshots"]: start_time = snapshot['StartTime'] if start_time &lt; delete_time: delete_snapshots.append(snapshot) else: delete_snapshots = snapshots size_counter = 0 for snapshot in delete_snapshots: size_counter = size_counter + snapshot['VolumeSize'] if args.delete is True: print("Deleting {0} {1}".format(snapshot['SnapshotId'], "Description: {0}".format(snapshot['Description']) * args.verbose) ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot['SnapshotId'],DryRun=False) else: print("Warning: Snapshot {0} not deleted! (add -d or --delete option) {1}".format(snapshot['SnapshotId'], "Description: {0}".format(snapshot['Description']) * args.verbose) print("Deleted {0} snapshots totalling {1} GB".format(len(delete_snapshots), size_counter)) #ok so why I made the changes above. # first creating a list with ids and not grabbing the other info you need from the initial list makes no sense. If you had 1000 snapshots and needed to delete 999 of them for every snapshot you are checking the list of 999 making about 1million checks big O of n^2. To make this better just store the whole response. It doesn't make a copy it uses a reference. Now you can loop over the deleted list. # so why don't I like your output function. What does it abstract? Print? A verbose flag but only allows the format text1 (space) text2. It really only fits one case, delete snapshot. What I would consider a better abstraction is a delete_snapshot function that is part of a class with the verbose flag that prints the correct format by checking the class flag. That way the delete only takes in the snapshot object. # other considerations. You could default age to 0 then you wouldn't need the age is None logic and it would still function the same. ``` 
Check and see if the time is changing iframes, if so you may need to change focus to that iframe.
SO seriously needs an overhaul. The Python community there (in more cases than not) is toxic and frankly a certain level of curation and “more recent” solutions that are optimal (due to library updates and other changes) should be considered. I’d tread lightly over there. 
Could you expand on what you mean?
But how long will we be waiting for it?
Sometimes elements are placed in different iframes. If you are focused on one iframe you will find all the elements within that iframe.l and not the others.
... And linters provide this functionality in Python. I think the real misunderstanding here is that he and you don't recognize that they do the same thing.

I just finished with some bug fixes on a python code formatter: [https://pypi.org/project/straitjacket/](https://pypi.org/project/straitjacket/)
Wow! Thanks u/nate256!! I will most definitely implement these changes! I had no idea that the proper way to comment in Python was like that. Thank you for your time!
For anyone wanting to get started with continuous integration, TravisCI offers pypy3. I've used that for my projects. 
What? Linters may try, but linters are best-effort, and can easily miss things which can break your code when you refactor. My point is that in a statically typed language it's not possible to miss something like this, by the very nature of the language. If you do not type annotate _all_ your code, it's very easy for a linter to miss something. Especially when you start using duck typing.
What about correlation with the types of users? Like languages popular for teaching undergrads may get lots of questions from confused freshmen.
And 'difficulty' is not an absolute value. It may be more difficult for a novice programmer to learn any language than a seasoned developer. So language used to teach programming, like Python, might get more questions from these users who are just learning programming (as opposed to learning another language on top of what they already know). 
[pyglet](pyglet.org) does 3D. It's a library, however, not an engine. 2D support is solid, but 3D is still in its infancy. For example it has only basic support for loading models (obj now, gltf soon), which I added just recently. pyglet is built right on OpenGL, so 3D is there, but it does lack tooling. If you want to work directly with GL primitives, you can certainly do that. Performance is quite good despite being pure Python, since it's literally just sitting on top of GL buffers and calls. 
&gt;apt install python3-pip just curious: why? Jake VanderPlas uses conda environments. And they work great for me, especially with Jupyter notebooks. What advantages would pyenv provide over conda env? 
I don’t think there will be any job where you just program in one language. You should look for jobs that will require you in Python, but I wouldn’t expect it to be only be that.
I started recently to learn django too. I am doing web dev with php mysql and some ML things with python but in the future I might extend it in django python web environment. So I got free account on pythonanywhere and in order to learn I built few simple things in python django - such as chatbot and API consuming from other service. I put few posts for this - [http://intelligentonlinetools.com/blog/2018/12/16/integrating-sentiment-analysis-api-python-django-web-application/](http://intelligentonlinetools.com/blog/2018/12/16/integrating-sentiment-analysis-api-python-django-web-application/) So I learned some basics of web dev with django doing above projects. &amp;#x200B; I prefer learning by doing but will read some resource too. There are many on internet. When I was building I came to website [djangobook.com](https://djangobook.com) They provide (via popup) free pdf of previous version django book. &amp;#x200B; I am planning to build few more things with Django. I am interesting in ML, API integration for ML and web dev. I think we can share with each other progress, issues and thoughts. &amp;#x200B; Thanks. &amp;#x200B;
Pyenv allows you to have system python, anaconda, precompiled python, of all versions, running on the same system in parallel. It greatly simplifies the complexity of running them all. And when you need to upgrade, you install it in parallel with your existing python installations and upgrade one project at a time. 
That's fine if you just want a bare python3 interpreter. I think you'll get into trouble quick if you want to use libraries as dependencies from something like 'pip'. &amp;#x200B; Python dependency management is such a terrible mess. Its the main reason why I don't like to use python (after having tried to write a few simple things with it). &amp;#x200B; I mean node/npm isn't exactly perfect. But pretty much, you do 'npm install some-fancy-library' and you basically can start using it in your code. &amp;#x200B; I think its supposed to be also that easy in Python, but somehow that has not been my experience. And so while programming in python is mostly fun... the whole dependcy management hell that came with it just ruined that for me.
Uhhh, you're always using duck typing in Python, though? 
Look into formatting your code for Reddit - it's difficult to parse this out visually. However, I think your approach won't work because of a few things. First, you're only updating your coordinates diagonally. What if the area was the rectangle from (0, 0) to (.5 , 1). You would expand until you hit (0.5, 0.5) and falsely conclude the area was 0.25 instead of 0.5 The bigger issue is that the problem is defined very generally. They don't say that the area is convex, they don't say that the area is a rectangle (in fact, their example is a quarter-circle), they don't even say that the area is all continuous. Technically, there could be two regions inside the 0-1 square on x/y that are 'covered'. Or 30 small circles placed around. How would you estimate the area of that? Think about it - I don't want to just tell you the answer. 
I think its slightly more complicated than that. For example python is very popular in bio informatics. I think that's because when developers started making these programs that scientists would use there was an assumption that scientists don't necessarily know how to code so they picked python because of its simplicity. This is all opinion
Take a look at Grafina..
True, but presumably one would get fewer questions for Python than, say, Brainfuck since Python is far more intuitive. 
Thanks, first time I heard about it. I'm checking it, seems to be very powerful indeed. Not sure if I need to pay for it though. I'll continue reading the doc, thanks again for the help!
This looks like a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) problem to me.
\+1 for PyEnv! It's cool as heck! 
I don't schools teaching 'brainfuck' but Python seems failrly popular to teach students at introdcutary level about for loops and ifs and the basics of programming. Brainfuck would come up much later in the curriculum as a extra twist. Kind of like, yeah... you know there's also some language without 'if' and 'for loop' and you can program in those too :-)
Thanks for the info. Would you have anything in mind? The place I am working PT for now is a devops consultancy and I have thought about looking into that but alas I don’t have the credentials. While my resume looks nice I don’t have any certifications. 
I’d be surprised if any do. 
I’ve used it before it’s very powerful and it has a community edition and a paid edition. The only significant difference between the two is commercial support.
There are definitely schools that teach Haskell as a first language. Yes there are. But they are far fewer than schools using Java, Python or even Scheme. 
1.5.1 - 2.1.1 has binary incompatibility from release to release. Between those versions it was a semi-stable, 2.2 is when Python became production quality. 
It works really well from my experience. Only gotcha I can think of is that with Ubuntu “pip” is for python2.X package management and “pip3” is for python3.X. I have made that mistake a ton of times myself. Not to say package management is perfect, but just know what you are importing and how it effects your environment and you should be good to go. I almost bought all the hysteria about the lack of community support for Python3, and found that not to be the case. The real issues are legacy organizational code bases, not community libraries. People keep writing Python2.X because their company, org, etc has a bunch of code that they don’t feel like converting over to Python3.X. I have only seen improvements since switching to Python3.X myself. The multiprocessing is much more functional in Python3 and native UTF strings makes a lot of things that were annoying in Python2.X go away. There are a ton of reasons to switch.
