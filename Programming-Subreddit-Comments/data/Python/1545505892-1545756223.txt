I don't know much about online programs. Phoenix is obviously themost popular one but people have mixed thoughts on it. I used my GI Bill at University and they offered accelerated programs that were online. I would just search around and if you get you BS while still in definitely use the GI Bill for either a Master's or certification courses at your University of choice. 
I don't think a stochastic approach to food preparation is a great idea, but then again at least he's actually preparing his own food.
Aaaand then?
I see, that's a clear explanation, thank you so much sir.
Prior service here, current software engineer/researcher. No getting around going to college, make use of that post 9-11 GI bill, if you really want to do it on a budget, start at a community college and transfer to a university (although that way typically takes longer). Also keep in mind that python is just a tool, The science/abstraction/design is the hard part, and you will learn that through educational coursework and projects I should add there are certainly options involving not involving a degree, but there are far fewer opportunities, and you will likely have a career ceiling that is pretty low.
Can someone run through the logic behind this algorithm please ?
To quote the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) &gt; Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! The `random` prefix helps disambiguate the function name
Haha, glad someone made it that far down! I think there are two directions, both of which need to be pursued. First, the top-down establishment of application importance. I think we don't have much choice but to be subjective. While power-user applications can be semi-quantifiably ranked by [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) scores, tweets, and blog coverage, scientific applications and pure consumer applications are much harder to measure. So for this I'm thinking a 1-10 importance scale to start out. Second, there is the bottom-up research of collecting application dependencies. Unlike library dependencies, most of these applications don't have a requirements.txt. Many of them have vendored their deps, too. One maybe-overambitious approach I'm imagining is collecting all the repo urls in APA's `projects.yaml`, then writing a script that clones them all and uses `ast` to pull out all the imports. There'll be noise to sort out, and packages don't map directly to PyPI distribution names, but it's the best I've come up with so far. Could also set up a site to crowdsource the data, but upkeep might be too big a chore. Anyways, I'm just glad someone found it interesting. Creating an index/metric like this is pretty much the best way I can imagine to supplement the FOSS Python ecosystem in the face of increasing corporate influence. Automate the advocacy. :)
Yeah, just a list of the URLs to the saved resources would be a good starting point. Maybe later add the date, title... allow sorting by either... Newline separating records, tab separating fields...
Where is pycharm looking for libraries? Also go to terminal type "python3". Then try to import beautifulsoup4. See if that works. 
GI Bill transferred to my wife for her Master's and a few other things to finish off things she needs for Teaching without the need of a school loan. I have no doubts that I can finish a 4 year online well before I get out. Going to just dive in and start it next month. Thanks.
Python is a high level language where you can do pretty much anything you want. It is probably easier language to learn and far quicker in my opinion. I have a degree in IT but not Comp-Sci, I ran my own development company for years. PHP, SQL, CSS are essentials for front end, but there are bunch of competition in front end development. I have been programming Python/Selenium bots for few years, it can pretty much automate any task on the web, most of the job offers today don't really care for your degree, rather what you can do with your programming skills. I recently came across a job ad from a big U.S bank, in the description it said you must include a working version of Rock, Paper, Scissors along with your resume in any programming language. If I can go back in time, I would certainly learn Python first (tons of potentials with A.I, data science) you should have no problem getting a job world wide as a junior developer.
You can start by reading the sidebar Then you can post in /r/learnpython You should probably also read THAT sidebar And you should try googling the solution you're looking for...
Thats really cute
I mostly agree with the above, but want to stress highly that getting a degree while you are still in would be a huge advantage. Beyond that don’t get hung up on Python. I’m saying that even if at this stage in my life Python is about it as far as programming languages go. The better approach in my mind would be finding a job that interests you. Web development is obviously a big niche but there are many very interesting niches out there. Many of these domains are also places where Python is used heavily but if not you don’t want to be left out of consideration for being a Python only developer. It is great if the perfect job pops up needing Python skills but that same job might need C++, Swift, Julia, COBOL (hopefully not) or many of the other popular languages. Effectively you would just be starting your career and that is something that will work out better if the job is a good fit with your interests, the programming language is a secondary but strong secondary consideration in my mind. In otherwords Python is a very widely used language but I wouldn’t want to demand it as the language for my first job. Instead take ajob for a year or two that directly challenges you, leaves you with experience and qualifications to chase a Python job. In otherwords out of the gate any experience gained is helpful. I see a lot of these sorts of posts, that amount to: what do I need to do to get s job as a Python programmer. For me that is a very narrow way to look at programming as a career and often leaves one with the impression that the poster is looking for the easy way out. My position is to get as much education as possible so that one can make programming language choices that fit the job at hand. You mentioned web development but that may mean a job supporting not just Python but also Javascript, SQL, Java and maybe other languages.

&gt;I should add there are certainly options involving not involving a degree, but there are far fewer opportunities, and you will likely have a career ceiling that is pretty low. This applies to everybody excservice or not. Sadly you will often be working in places where only the degree matters. In someplaces even the school it comes from matters. On the flip side I’ve meant enough self educated programmers that are so thinly educated that even a student with only two years of schooling under the belt can run circles around these individuals. Education is really what separates the talented from the also fans. To be fair a few self educated individuals can achieve a high level of ability but that is not the norm. The norm seems to be to learn just enough to get a degree and then freeze IMmediately afterward.

Absolutely. It's not about being shorter, but about being more explicit. The problem with a lot of people coming from C-like languages is that they want to do everything with indices. You will see so many range(len(list)) out there.
Lol
It's not at all about making it shorter, but rather about using the more explicit and appropriate calls. It's like people doing: for i in range(len(items)): print items[i] instead of for item in items: print item They are both more or less the same length, but one is far cleaner, Pythonic and explicit.
tbf that's one of my least favorite syntaxes, though I see the need. I always feel strange when I see `items + (item,)` Sometimes I wonder how i'd look if tuples had similar .append and .extend but instead returned a new tuple
Thank you for sharing these resources with me. 
To be clear, it's not so much about using more lines of code. It's about using the right APIs and being more explicit about what you're doing. I often write code out to use more lines of code if it makes the code cleaner and more explicit. The other one is inherently easier to read and follow the logic.
Please don't.
How do I get it running? Trying to follow the instructions, but it's not working on windows
Try pydroid 3. I don't really know if they have that module. 
Don't you create a virtual environment for your projects? 
What is instabot? Does it give errors when trying to run with Python 3.7? How are you trying to run it?
Agreed ex-military get a degree. Recommend computer engineering more than computer science computer science is more of an applied math degree. Computer science is broader but still has a good amount of applied programming
Computer engineering is less programming than Computer Science. Engineering is a specific type of Electrical Engineering degree and focuses on hardware. CS is for software mostly
Yeah depends on the school that you're at. Either way I would recommend computer engineering over computer science.
Where to buy though?
If you use the `dis` module to view the bytecode, you can also see the comprehension building and calling a function, FWIW.
Is "yield from" still not optimized (i.e. exactly the same as `for it in iterable: yield it`), by the way? I guess it would still work for Ned because it's only one frame per tree level in that case.
Can I throw some fuel on the application fire here? I love creating standalone distros so I can use my crap on any system (PyInstaller mostly) &amp;#x200B; I think it would be very helpful (or interesting at least) to pool together application design techniques/practices in one of these github "mega-lists" or whatever these are dubbed nowadays...Something along the lines that shows some recipes/concepts that are app-centric like, (1) killing your own PID, (2) call back to home on crash (3) splash loading screen (4) patching/updating apps and those sort of things... &amp;#x200B; If anyone knows where such a thing exists, please post that here.
Another vet here. I would like to highly discourage you from persuing anything online. There are no short cuts to the critical thinking skills you'll develop during the course of aquiring a degree the "normal" way.
You think someone that can't figure out how to install/uninstall a certain version knows how to use virtual environments? 😂
I would also recommend json but it appears to specify that a text file must be used. Not sure how strict the assignment is. 
The ones that allowed me to achieve max lazyness. 
I would interpret that saving JSON on a file counts as text, but who knows XD

My dude. You're one contract away from a comfy retirement.
&gt;if tuples had similar .append and .extend but instead returned a new tuple That breaks the principle of least surprise, imo.
Their docs literally say: ```python import click @click.command() @click.option('--count', default=1, help='Number of greetings.') def hello(count): for x in range(count): click.echo('Hello') if __name__ == '__main__': hello() ``` So I dont see how! They even have to provide special click test running stuff: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/testing/. Which I suppose could be useful even in an ideal scenario, but its certainly much less required when if you dont alter the functions you're decorating.
Do what dirtydaver says....too many people "learn" python online and believe they are "programmers." Trust me, there is a world of difference between knowing ar high level programming language and knowing how to program. Theories of algorithm analysis, comparing algorithms, when to use certain data structures/core sorting algorithms, OOP, etc. 
100% use your benefits for school. Even if you don’t get a degree in Computer Science, you’ll get college level courses to help further your knowledge and gain employment. This is what I’m doing currently. Unfortunately I didn’t discover Programming until I used up half of my benefits under a different major. My military caused disability ended that career path for me. Now, with taking a max of 18 credits every semester I should be able to get my AS in Computer Science and do something I actually love. Fingers crossed.

I've never heard of it. I've also never held any type of "certification" for Python or any other type of programming, and it hasn't held me back from getting jobs. The Python Software Foundation (the nonprofit that holds the trademark on Python, fundraises for Python events and organizes PyCon, etc.) gives out a sort of lifetime recognition for contributions to Python and its community in the form of the PSF Fellowship, but aside from that I'm not aware of "certifications" they'd offer, and they'd be the ones to do it considering their role.
I myself am a Linux SysAdmin w/o certs (never really cared for them) and have been working for over a decade now, but lately I feel like taking some certs. I thought I asked because Cisco and PearsonVUE offer courses and certs for those. The latter is pretty established in cert releases, so I was wondering if the Python Institute was just too new to be known.
Your question is missing the information about the operating system you want your script to run on.
Preferably cross-platform, but I doubt that’s going to be possible. Most DJ’s use Mac.
&gt; Oh, hey, howsabout, say, when you refactor and change the datatype of a column in your database, and then therefore your ORM, etc. Like say the common boolean -&gt; date transformation. Or remove a column which has an unfortunately common name, like, oh, 'type.' If your unit tests don't cover that, then you should probably write better unit tests.
Oh, I kinda figured that, but it's nice to use when running commands directly from the command line like: python3 -c "print(__import__('datetime').datetime.now().strftime('%d, %b %Y'))"
Perhaps even attempts to brute force their passwords. https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/a2v4lf/how_to_hack_instagram_accounts_without_kali_linux/?utm_source=reddit-android
You need to first find out if the OS has an API that does what you need, then you need to find a lib that wraps that API, or write one yourself.
It looks like he is looking to either brute force passwords or steal content based on a previous post. I'm not helping. https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/a2v4lf/how_to_hack_instagram_accounts_without_kali_linux/?utm_source=reddit-android
Actually, `secrets.choice(action)` would be better to use just as a matter of general practice. I avoid `random` wherever possible, even if it's not necessary.
You can beat OP's 15 years daugther at writing trivial scripts, you must be feeling proud of your merits.
Is there a tinyxml2 wrapper module, or is that just a bad idea?
Of course. I was thinking of prior to the unit test run. Like as you’re trying to figure out if you’re close to being done with your first pass. A compiler is able to tell you Real Fast. Our test suite was quite thorough and deep at the expense of taking a *long* time (hours), which is certainly its own issue. But it made it so that whole suite passes came in later on in the overall development cycle and not at the immediate fingertips of the refactoring developer. 
Yes, I can't believe that a smart-arse comment showing a shorter version of the script, as saying look ma, I can write more pythonic code (compared to 3 simple lines written by a teenager) is getting above 300 upvotes. Should expect less of people.
Oh ruby how I love you. [ ‘slice’, ‘dice’, ‘chop’ ].shuffle.pop
Nobody cares about certifications in programming. If you want to demonstrate any kind of competency just put something you've worked on up on Github. Literally any demo project is miles better than a certification from an institute nobody has heard of.
*went to 12 week python bootcamp* *can't get a job so pwns 15 y/o's heartfelt work* Hashtag new-age programmers
That’s weird. Georgia Tech was so successful with their controversial Online Masters of Computer Science (OMCS) that most of not all criticism of their platform disappeared after the first iteration. UC Berkeley also has several online masters programs now. Those are easily top 5 schools on a consistent basis. Additionally, there are numerous regionally accredited online B.S. programs for CS that are respected. Not sure what value you are referring to that is exclusive to the “normal” way. Please elaborate.
That sounds terrible. Just save all post data in JSON format. Its a good universal standard for passing data.
Well on there you can use semicolon, that's still probably cleaner `python3 -c "import datetime; datetime.now().strftime('%d, %b %Y')"`
Flask is awesome. Especially when you get it deployed to Heroku, then you really have a permanent web app that you can code (mostly) in Python. &amp;#x200B; I think you should crosspost this to r/redditdev, they would appreciate it. 
The "career ceiling" thing only really applies in a few industries; given the demand for skilled programmers, this isn't going to hold you back if you have what it takes. I know this because I've done it - I'm in a well-paid, fairly prestigious consultant role at a highly regarded firm, and I only hold a degree in jazz music. I could have made it into management by now, if that had been my ambition.
Damn I. Just had this idea last night
Learned something else today: semicolon = new line. Thanks man! Just out of curiosity, is there something that replaces indentation?
The Python world doesn't really do certifications. Anyone claiming to offer one for Python is likely to be hoping they'll make a quick buck giving you a useless piece of paper.
As a hiring manage, I'd chuckle inside if I saw this on a resume.
What is actually saved when you save a post? I suspect it's just the ID and time you saved it, and the rest is queried on view. I'm fine with just that
CISCO's logo is in there. Could it be something serious...
This is true. For what I read on their web page, it would qualify you for teaching the basics of python, not for being proficient in it...
Nice
Online is not an attempt to take a shortcut. I still work a full time job as does my wife with my kids all in after school sports. Online would be ideal for my situation.
Oops. I've fixed that naming problem now so just refresh your cache to get the new changes.
Thanks for that advice. I'm starting to phase out obsolete functions with 6 removed in the [latest update](https://github.com/Richienb/quilt/releases/tag/0.8.0). Luckily, Quilt is still in an Alpha phase so I can still make large changes.
You should scrap this project; there are very few functions in here that have any real value. 
I also acknowledge that a ~3000 line file is a bad idea. This is why I minify the entire codebase for release to take up a footprint of about 4 lines by removing all comments and docstrings, changing all variables to single letters and compressing it all with gzip.
No. No no no. Do not do that. That is not pythonic. 
I have to be honest with you I wouldn't take any cert seriously unless it costed you thousands of dollars and I knew the name of it off the top of my head. You need a certification to fly an Airbus. You need a certification to run IT security for a wall street bank. You don't need a certificate to code in Python. That's how I feel about certs, they aren't useless but I can pick out which ones are pretty quick. 
You can settle for less and make it more difficult for yourself, or OP could simply pass all available data in json.
You're looking for comments. [This guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-comments-in-python-3) seems comprehensive.
If I understand what you’re asking, you have two options: Turn that line of text into a “string” by surrounding it with quotes (`’` or `”`). You should do this if you want to use the text somewhere in your script. Turn the line of text into a comment by putting `# ` in front of it. You should do this if you want your script to ignore the text completely. 
The career ceiling thing is primarily due to career mobility, you get your biggest raises changing jobs, if you have a tough time finding other opportunities you're going to have a hard time getting promotions. Of course that doesn't mean it's impossible, but without that college education it's far less likely.
I love to see real world development! Keep it up m8!
I think certs are more of a thing in the IT/sysadmin world -- they're much less common/much less trusted in the software development world. I do know that Amazon and Microsoft do offer some certs (e.g. for things like AWS), and those might be useful to have in certain circles, but I don't think there exists a reputable or well-known Python-specific cert, nor do I think there's really any interest in creating or popularizing one.
What isn't Pythonic?
Awesome work!
You are right, at least on my Mac. I found the frustration on Windows, and may have misremembered the issue, but at least \`subprocess.call(Path('ls'))\` is still broken, and \`subprocess.call(\[Path('ls')\])\` was broken until fairly recently. [https://bugs.python.org/issue33617](https://bugs.python.org/issue33617) [https://bugs.python.org/issue31961](https://bugs.python.org/issue31961) &amp;#x200B;
Minification. Modifying source for distribution. Distribution by gz. Pip install git+https://www. [...] from source,pypi m, or distribute binary wheels. Anything else is wrong. 
On mac, start by looking into either [Soundflower or Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/).
Sounds like good blog material! I could see adding a section to the list to collect posts of this nature :)
The last time I saw a "programming" certification worth anything was 2003. These days, as everyone else has said: just know what you're talking about in an interview and be prepared for someone to ask you a question where the correct answer is "I'd have to Google it" rather than try to pretend you know, and dig yourself a hole so deep you're not going to be able to get out. 
Well in that case, which [pyminifier](https://liftoff.github.io/pyminifier/#overview) flags can I use to keep my code pythonic?
I don't disagree with anything you've said, but a CS degree will *not* really teach you how to program (to industry standards). Version control, design patterns, etc. there is a lot that academia will gloss over, if it's covered at all. What a CS degree *will* do is teach you how to solve problems efficiently, often with the help of a computer. It will teach you how to create and evaluate data structures and algorithms ("why is this so slow now that we have 1M active users, and how do I fix it?"). Depending on your electives, you may choose to learn a number of things: how does my operating system work? what makes databases so fast compared to plain text files? how do domain names work, and how does a packet on my PC know how to get to to the right server? what made Google's search capabilities so groundbreaking in the late 90's? You can learn programming and succeed as a programmer without a degree, but if you have the luxury of the time and money required to get a degree, I would absolutely recommend it.
I’m a student, I’m planning to implement a project where an individual is able to write a code in the regional language. The whole point of this project is to give a sense of programming to the crowd at an early age without the knowledge of English language. So apparently I have to dig into heaps of C files which I am okay with, since it’s a project. 
Not totally sure how do I do it hence, posting it here. 
I was literally thinking about that same functionality yesterday but I had in mind a Chrome extension. I'll definitely check it out when I got the time ;)

 You may paint yourself into a corner with ElementTree and find you need features in LXML so unless you have a strong reason for wanting to stay with a standard library I’d recommend LXML - especially if you need XPath expressions. 
The only programming certifications I've known to be worth anything are for COBOL. And really, the value is just having the letters COBOL on your resume, so YMMV.
I totally agree with all your statements. I was not totally clear on my thoughts as I posted them.
I think they could easily have implemented a search function for saved posts but then their gold only feature of tags for saved posts become redundant
This is one of the driving motivators for PulseAudio, the one that people love to hate for no reason. Admittedly, it was kind of buggy in 2008.

As a CS dropout (sadly not the cool successful startup kind) I second everything you say here. You can become a decently successful programmer/dev on your own, but when you look at the serious innovation going on in the industry, it's almost always CS degree holders to a person. With that said, it's possible to learn CS on your own, but unless you're really good at self learning you'll either get discouraged or end up with lots of gaps.
Increasing sys.setrecursion limit is an option. I’ve tried it on a couple of platforms, both 2.7 and 3.x, 32 and 64 bit, linux and mac. The actual limit before getting a segfault varies between ~15000 and 24000. So 10000 or a more conservative limit of 5000 should be ok. Can anyone test this is on Windows?
Thank you!
Thanks!
Are you using some reddit API to get the list of the results or are you scraping them? 
Yeah, makes it easy to get started too. I also like jinja2 templates, makes creating HTML pages a breeze. I heard of Heroku before — maybe I will add my app on the there some time. I thought about that but it seems more for questions than sharing stuff. 
Ah makes sense!
Making reddit API calls each time. Would love to persist/cache saved posts for faster searching though.
Congratulations, you have answered one of the four questions asked. How on earth do you expect anyone to help you if you're so obstinately refusing to give even the most basic of answers to simple questions? Why would you expect anyone to *want* to help when you're being this disrespectful of their time?

Imagine how'd you feel if after hours of digging into a convoluted configuration written in a custom-made language you realize that the problem is that PulseAudio tries to use your keyboard as an audio device. Wait, no, it was Alsa, PulseAudio was just wrapping it.
Ok, well that will be an interesting project. You might find some helpful starting points reading [this blog entry](http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/12/04/chinese-python-multilingual-programming-2/) about a project to translate Python including the documentation and interpreter into Chinese... unfortunately when I try to access the actual Chinese Python website I get a server misconfiguration error. There is however some useful discussion on Reddit you can access through there, and a link to [hpy](http://nirs.freeshell.org/code/hpy/) that seems to take a somewhat simpler but far less exhaustive approach and simply pre-processes a file written in Hebrew into a standard "English" python file, then let's the standard interpreter run it. The latter approach would obviously be less performance-friendly, and wouldn't allow you to significantly change the overall grammatical structure (ie you'd tend to have to maintain English-style verb/noun conjugation and phrase ordering) but would likely be _much_ easier to generalize than a full translation. It hasn't been worked on in quite a while, but could provide some good ideas.
Thanks! I wish you the best of luck on creating your site! It's frustrating at times but totally worth the personal sastifaction of actually building a site and learning new skills 😄
Taking your ShadowPlay as an example: well, it only works with NVIDIA hardware. That's because they know how it works. You'll find a similar problem with audio: not everything plays in the same way. For example, there's mostly non-existent in everyday life, but somewhat present in lives of professional musicians midi audio. Unlike playing mp3, which, if you compare to images, you can think of as a jpeg: i.e. all information about the image is uniform and is mixed together, it plays particular instruments, each one separately, so it's more like an svg, where each shape can be manipulated without affecting the rest. So... the protocol for playing it is different from other audio, and you may not be able to capture it using the same tools you'd use to capture, say, sound coming from your microphone.
&gt; its various statistical labels including natural language I'm not sure I understand. I don't recall github showing more than a breakdown by programming language (JS, Java, C, etc.)
XML is a huge standard, but most libraries go for a small subset of it. `lxml` is probably the only one that tries to implement everything in the standard (it's not a Python library and wasn't intended that way, Python simply has a library with bindings to it). The only reason you may consider *not* using it is if your program needs to be distributed to platforms like Windows for people who are clueless about how to install stuff. You can, in principle, find precompiled version of the library, but it may not exist for every combination of interpreter and OS, and so you may run into situation where the clueless user needs to download a bunch of obscure libraries in order to compile the one you need.
Sounds like much help, will get back one I get to work on it. Thanks a lot! :)
Wow ! This is really good. What did you use for the front end. I like the clutter free look that your website has.
There is something very fucky about the way you're doing this. I'll have to take it over to my computer later but my first geuss is that you're not declaring your lists, and it seems like you've got one more append than you need. 
&gt; If a language is compiled is every practical use case Again, there is no such thing as compiled language. Programs are compiled, languages aren't. You just misattribute a quality of one object to another, and get confused by the outcomes of incorrect word manipulation. So, what you written further makes no sense. It's just a bad use of nomenclature, like when for some reason, the English-speaking world decided to call turkey a turkey (while it has nothing to do with the country of the same name). Yes, today this historical mistake is codified in dictionaries and is the standard way to refer to the bird, but it still doesn't make any sense. In programming we aren't yet in such a bad state, where we just have to accept historical idiotic legacy.
I'd like to look into a way to encourage answering questions on the sister sub, r/learnpython, from members of this community. I'm terrible at it and am trying to get better, but it'd be cool if helping users there was a point of pride for frequent redditors here
I used bootstrap on the front end. I'm glad you liked it, clutter free was the goal.
Github has readmes, the comments in the code, plus all the stars and pull requests and generally its a record for how code fits with other code in order to make executable files. Idk, it just seems like a treasure trove of raw data and labels where the raw data is the code and the labels are the categories and whatnot that the developers put the various snippets of code into
I was going to post why I disagree with this but then I thought about it and +1 instead. Using cryptographocally secure randomness by default unless you deliberately want the reproducibility of a seedable PRNG is a position that's well worth encouraging. Especially since I have occasionally seen arguments of the opposite form like "no my *password generator* doesn't need to be cryptographically secure so why should I bother?".
Tried aiohttp?
Your code doesn't account for roomY being greater than roomX. Since both are random ints, you'll need an explicit check to make sure x &gt; y, and if that fails, just swap them or regenerate.
Why not just do a list comp like [[x, y] for x in range(roomX) for y in range(roomY)]

I did not wrap it list comprehetions to made easy to understand. Hope, it helps. &amp;#x200B; `MAX_SIZE = 3` `coordinates = []` `for x in range(MAX_SIZE):` `for y in range(MAX_SIZE):` `coordinates.append([x, y])`
Looks good
Try this approach.

Im sorry im not gonna sit here and lie to you like every other person in this thread. The site works pretty well and I like the idea of it. However, it looks like shit. The people telling you that it looks nice are just trying to be nice. I'm telling you this so you can improve the site; trust me, dont settle for something like this. Look up some html templates and rework the html of your site. Its a pain in the ass to read on desktop and there's no organization. Also the animations are a bit weird. &amp;#x200B; Im really not trying to be mean and I hope you can take the criticism. Otherwise, the rest of the site is pretty well done, so congrats on that :)

Django rocks. Nice work. Simple, fast, also - purple butt cheeks
Oh god lol
Learn Python 3 The Hard Way, definitely the best one.
I appreciate the truth. Honestly I rushed the front end and I know it could of been a better, focused mostly on backend cause I enjoy coding that the most. My html, css, and bootstrap is very limited and will be working on learning that in detail months to come. Learnt a lot of what not to do with this project. Thanks for the honesty!

Lambdas are great for filters and maps, but on-the-fly definitions should be generally avoided! Keep in mind that each time you lambda and don't preserve it, Python has to create the memory space for it. A simple def accomplishes the same thing, so in tight loops for instance, you can save a lot of time. In most other cases, using def over lambda, even inline, improves readability.

&gt; Ex: If I want to buy a pair of shoes I need money. I'm rich so money is not an issue hahaha It's a shame you haven't learned to read. Start with the sidebar. 
rip me
Frankly, that has never been an issue for me either. The only jobs that I might have wanted but couldn't get were teaching gigs, and those tend to not pay anywhere near as much as I'm making now. But then again, my background is very different, and I live in a different area, so it may or may not apply.
I wish we had better syntax, like `|x| =&gt; x + 1` or maybe even just `def x = x + 1` would be better. 
So you don't like the technology because of how you perceive it's advocates to be? I'm literally asking for you to provide some reasons as to why and all you can do is throw shade my way. Are you an engineer or an elementary school student? You did mention lock-in. Is that really a huge concern, considering so much is open source? For my company, we've yet to lean on Kubernetes for anything, instead we are simply using Docker to build and run images. The tooling around that is still our own, and we feel that's pretty flexible.
I agree, but that's ok because it discourages overuse.
I've stopped using lambdas altogether. Named temporary functions are much cleaner and can be written in a way that they don't have to be recreated as often.
I use lambda a lot when fitting equations to my data. Bad habit or usefull? Equations take 6 parameter, but I keep one or two fixed. 
Great work, also I saw some features which look not hard to implement so I will try to make a contributions 
You're adding a string and some ints, that's not how this works, you want to use a if to Switch on user input or a dict that holds the operator as string and the metbod that's called by that Operator als value Or do everything as string and use eval but don't do that is so fucking insecure (like people could wipe your disk with the input, or open network connections etc.) Also please read PEP 8
Could be. But man, then you haven't worked with Spark and pyspark. Lambda, map, filters are a blessing there.
That's weird that it failed, because it looks so good
I totally agree. In my video, I have mentioned that one must not try to convert every normal function to a lambda, it's irrelevant and inefficient. 
That's precisely what I'm encouraging! Thank you.
Not only typing ‘lambda’ does not bother me, I also find it pretty mnemonic and readable.
very expensive
/u/pylenin quickly jumped through the video, it seemed good and the subreddit is correct this time. Good job!
Thanks
... Can you really get a [4 BR/1 BA](http://www.adairtrader.com/post/5/23/) for only $33k in Iowa? Median I'm seeing on zillow is $130k. Still, I gotta get the fuck out of California.
What you show is not enough to give an exhaustive answer. The missing information: 1. What is your current working directory (run `pwd` to figure that out), and where is the directory structure you show above relative to the current working directory. 2. What is the value of `PYTHONPATH`? 3. What version of Python are you using? 4. Does any of the files you show modify `sys.path` in any way? 5. Are there packages on `sys.path` that are called something like `sound`, `sound.format`, `sound.effect`?
What the other person said about it adding ints and a string is right. But to give you an idea how to do it right, you might write a function for the different operations like this: def add(x, y): return x + y def sub(x, y): return x - y Then you might map the different operations to the function it uses: calculator_function = { '+': add, '-': sub, ... } Then, this might be your maths: def maths(x, op, z): func = calculator_function[op] print(func(x, z)) Another more obvious thing might be to just have an if/elif in there: def maths(x, op, z): if op == '+': print(x + z) elif op == '-': print(x - z) etc 
Great deal! Very powerful, and and nice to have.
You might wanna look into functools.partial for this type of function
I'm in the same boat as you. Currently, I'm reading the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. And afterwards, jump on to "Learn Python The Hard Way". Have a look!

We used xmltodict in a project. Don't do it. Just use ElementTree. If you do use it, don't keep the dict representation around any longer than you need to - turn it straight into an application specific representation.
Me too.I find lambda functions very handy. syntactically, they can be put in a lot of places where defs can't be put.
Cool that it’s 50% off, but do that many people actually code on their phones? And seriously enough that you need code completion, a UI editor, and everything else? Sounds like an awesome app, I just can’t see myself writing anything over 20 lines on mobile. 
You add every Element to the list. If the list has 30 entries, also delete the first Element of the list. 
For example, I wrote [this](https://github.com/ForceBru/PyVM) in Pythonista, and actually _for_ Pythonista. I've also been building a toy programming language (that is, a compiler, an assembler and a virtual machine) _for_ Pythonista for half a year now, and it's relatively close to actually being useful at the moment. I'm also writing _a lot_ of stuff in Pythonista every single day (seriously), and it's extremely convenient to use when you can't be bothered to get a computer running. So, if you're into Python, Pythonista is _the shit_!
Strictly speaking, list is a dynamic array since it holds elements of the same type, namely `PyObject`.
I've seen many blogs that did a great job of covering design approaches and tips, but am having a hard time locating them atm. [https://uxplanet.org/](https://uxplanet.org/) is decent, but I've seen better for sure. Just google "2018 website UI design" and the likes, and read read read. 
Maybe use a dictionary? import time data = {} data[time.time()] = value
Could work but make it hard to get only newest value (aka list[-1]) and I still need to drop old values myself on insert and/or read to avoid object getting bigger and bigger. I really think I'm missing something here, there must be a NICE way to sort this out.
To learn really basics I like Sam's Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours. I think that is the best completely new to programming book. 
I presume you're replying to me, recommend /r/LearnPython for these type of questions. Try this, clears 'old' values when you access the last thirty seconds: import time class TimeLimitedList: def __init__(self): self.data = {} def insert(self, value): self.data[time.time()] = value def get_last_thirty_seconds(self): self.data = [self.data[timestamp] for timestamp in self.data if timestamp &gt; time.time() - 30] return self.data

Okay well that probably the best thing to do. I'll make a separate cleanup method to be called when both getting or inserting and use an ordereddict to ensure data remains in insertion order. Thanks
Collections.deque would let you operate as a rin* buffer quite efficiently 
Yes but it's size limited, not time
cPython is the reference interpreter. Don't use pypy unless you're 100% sure you know what you're doing.
We had a report for this post but since the comments so far have been saying it has benefited them, I am going to leave this post up.
&gt; I still need to drop old values myself on insert and/or read to avoid object getting bigger and bigger You can use a dictionary with timestamp mod 30: data[int(time()) % 30] = value 
3rd world is mostly all mobile.
Would you mind explaining further the concept of "preserving a lambda function" and how the memory management is different? I'm quite interested but not really sure what you mean. 
That would be sweet! Let me know if you run into any issues.
deque has a maxlen argument that will automatically pop the extra entires off the end
In short: you should never assign a name to a `lambda`. YES: def f(x): return 2*x NO: f = lambda x: 2*x &gt; The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically `f` instead of the generic `&lt;lambda&gt;`. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression) 
I use lambda in tkinter
TBH nowadays filters and maps should be done via list comprehension and generators. It's both more readable and more efficient.
Use comprehensions for filter and map
Not gonna lie to you either: This website... ...is \*really\* good for a first site. My gosh I remember my first 5 websites, and they weren't even close to this one. I'd doubt TC's were either, and they probably didn't share them on a reddit. &amp;#x200B; Since we can't see the code, the only things we get to comment on are the design. As some others have said, you can find guides/principles of design that you can follow. There are various schools of thought. You can just randomly pick one, it doesn't matter much... just pick one and follow the rules. A few of the design issues I would personally fix if I were were you: Black bar at the top: dno, get rid of it somehow. The bar is seemingly useless, and the black is distracting while the rest of the site is white. Left margin should match right. Right now, it's almost like your site is left-aligned on all pages. Your cards ought to be click-able anywhere on the card, not just the title or "see listings" bits. Those are calls to action that help and should stay, but people will try to click on the card and be stopped when they cant. On /create/ suddenly your link css has disappeared. ... Are you using templates? I would have expected the green link CSS to continue through. I didn't get too far without actually submitting a BS listing, but on your create a new post page, you've got way too much font stuff going on: Bold, not bold, various sizes (step 1 vs add a new vs title/town...etc. &amp;#x200B; ...also the left alignment. &amp;#x200B; The "continue" button at the bottom also doesn't match your CSS coloring anymore. You can customize all of this, and should. Looks like the default bootstrap stuff.
Amazing.... What do you use it for ? Any specific application ?
Lambdas need to be as atomic as possible. They feel so out of place in Python code that they are very hard to grok as a human reading code, which goes against everything that Python is about.
Look at the following code: for lista in some_iterable: yield map(lambda x: x.some_method('abc' ), lista Here a new lambda function is defined every iteration. Since the lambda doesn't change between iteration, you can define it only once and reuse it: my_lambda=lambda x: x.some_method('abc') for lista in some_iterable: yield map(my_lambda, lista) Here lambda function is defined only once. Personally I try to avoid maps and filters and use generators and list comprehension whenever I've got the chance, a functionally identical generator for the code above would be ( [ x.some_method('abc') for x in lista] for lista in some_iterable )
I think the atomic role goes for everything in coding. More atomic everything is, less is your O(N) complexity and hence highly maintainable.
&gt; I don't know why but the lambda syntax we have just looks so off and clunky to me. The reason python uses the keyword lambda, is because of lambda calculus.. the reason lambda calculus uses λ (the lambda symbol) is because it's short... so python copies something opaque to most for a reason that it doesn't preserve and just ends up being ugly, too long and less readable. I feel like it's just such a brainfart on the part of the developers that they went with this. if they where going to go with a long word, at the very least they could have used **function** which is also annoyingly long, but at the very least specifies exactly what it is. With python supporting unicode now, you could recoup some of the conciseness by making definitions like λx:x+1 or similar work, but the lambda symbol is annoying to type, since it's not on your keyboard, and can't even be access with alt codes like for instance µ is (alt+230), but then you'd also be left with still having to type more even if the symbol is concise. The only benefit to this syntax you could argue, in my opinion, is that it looks almost exactly like lambda calc, which is a nice historical touch to those who've studied that.... but what's that worth in the larger scheme of things? I mean if they renamed for loops to goto to instill some nostalgic sensation in those who'd started out programming in basic that wouldn't be an overall plus for the language either right? As you can tell I'm really not a fan of the lambda syntax in python, I feel like they sat down and had a very thorough discussion about what potential solutions could be, and then took the absolute worst path in every single regard. At this point I hope they just say "fuck it this sucks" And copies javascript (of all languages) which had the common sense to use the proper annoying and too long keyword to begin with, and has now fixed it so lambdas definitions are actually short eg: (x)=&gt;x+1. 
To an extent sure. Otherwise, you end up with spaghetti code / Enterprise FizzBuzz.
I found [this](https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/) article enlightening. I still use them in my code from time to time, but not nearly as often as I used to.

You want to automate the clicking of boxes in a GUI app? On Windows, you can use powershell or the winapi to do this. A far less reliable method would be to use the pyautogui python library to control the mouse directly.
Thank you, that is a good starting point. But is it possible to tell Python to click a specific Button? So it doesn't matter where the Window of the installer opens? 
I do not have that much experience with the package to answer that, but a possible workaround would be to maximise every window by keyboard shortcut
i just had a look through some code of mine and my main use, by far, is as arguments to defaultdict(). seem a reasonable use to me. ^(i also found a map, which i should reewrite as a list comprehension, but i don't think that code has a test so i won't...)
Projects will often have a CONTRIBUTING file, section in their README, or something similar about their preferred process for contributing. The cpython GitHub repository has it in their README, and links to their [developer's guide](https://devguide.python.org/). It's a fairly straightforward process. One of the key points is opening an issue on GitHub about your new feature, which is important so that you can develop the feature with input from the community and core developers, to ensure that your feature fits well with the project and is smoothly accepted into the project. It's better to discuss your plans and suggestions before opening a pull request so that maintainers know what to expect from your solution, and that there's a record of conversation for your code. If you haven't already, you'll be asked to write at least some amount of tests for your code. This is important for getting your code accepted, and critical for the project itself. Since you wrote the code, you're the most intimately aware of certain edge cases where it could break, or what important functionality needs to be there. Ideally, these would all be accounted for, but of course in reality, you can only test as much as you can think of. You can ask for help writing tests, but you should have some ready. Your code also has to pass the rest of the tests already there. You may have the best code in the world, but it can't be trusted to work without tests proving this. This all may sound like a lot of work - it really isn't. It's all a good habit to get in to
Thanks for the detailed answer, I'll look into it :D
Disclaimer: I'm the developer of this app. I just wanted to add that there is also a (free) public beta of the upcoming 3.3 release with some new features, including a scriptable custom keyboard that you can use to run Python scripts in pretty much any iOS app, plus support for Siri shortcuts.

Why use this over other open-source Python “IDE”s, such as Atom?
Because i made it by my own to :) to improve my python skills 
Hmm, let me try
This doesn't belong in r/python unless you share some code, son.
I use named lambdas to indicate temporary functions in the sense that the function's name isn't preserved after the function has been bound to an object. E.g. for assigning functions to Tkinter buttons. I find this gives me very compact code but is more readable than putting the lambda within the object's definition, and keeps the line short and unwrapped. E.g.: butnames = ["Start", "Stop", "Reset", "Quit"] for bname in butnames: butcall = lambda action=bname: showtime(action) tk.Button(root, text=bname, command=butcall).pack() This is very bad, is it? (I'm a hardware engineer, not a software engineer.)

It’s not pythonic but I don’t think it’s bad. I definitely prefer this style, and it’s common in other languages like JS, but for some reason some people feel a def is better. I think inline defs break up readability. 
very unhelpfull
Oh yeaa I do remember your previous thread

Cython needs a compiler, so you're installing Visual Studio. If you have a problem with how that works, write to Microsoft. :-) I suppose you could use mingw (it's gcc for windows). If it works.
Why is there not a minimal compiler, just enough to compile cython, right in there?
Very cool! I liked the deadcode elimination feature. Good job
gcc is installed on most linux machines by default. Windows developers probably already have Visual Studio installed. Shipping your own compiler is a huge headache. You might be able to find a 3rd party distribution of cython that includes a compiler.
I didn't fully understand what you were asking the first time. Do you want a compilier to install cython itself, or code built with cython? There's probably a prebuilt windows binary if you want the latter. If you want the former, shipping your own compiler is a huge pain in the ass.
&gt; In any event I'm a strong believer that we can be too focused on "programming" in high school doing students a huge disfavor So do I. Students at whole must to learn how to deal with the digital world, how to use its possibilities . Young people really need how to deal with different services offered nowadays by their computers rather than learn the art of programming at whole. P.S. I graduated in 1984 8-) 
Pyautogui has a feature to screenshot and then find buttons using image matching. https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screenshot.html 
Use eval &gt;&gt;&gt; eval("2 + 3 * 4") 14 If you eval untrusted input you can get hacked, but this is a desktop calc program, so the user's not going to hack themself. If they do, it's not your problem either.
I want to download one package in which i find cython and all i need to run it. also a compiler. so that i dont have to seach trough all of stackoverflow, download gigabytes of crap i dont need and want just to get single files that just seem to be missing.
Looks like you forgot to pass args to `parser.parse_args`. To catch such cases you should’ve added more tests, for example to check if valid input results in expected arguments. 
Same for PyQt5 and PySide, they're essential for doing certain things with signals and slots.
Thats a cool solution, but who are those animals that only provide pictures of urls?
We have a stupid policy. Mostly the management staff sends all notifications to class representatives by e mail. The class representatives screenshots the email and then circulates it among all the students through WhatsApp and Facebook. The bigger problem is that nobody even bothers to shorten the damn urls.
Nice little project, it's fun tinkering around like that. I'd suggest however to address this problem on a human level. Who in their right mind puts text and especially links that you're supposed to click in an image? You should ask those people to stop doing that. And for beginners watching here is a little code review: * Python actually has a module [`tempfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html) which lets you create actual temporary files which you don't necessarily have to clean up. * `pytesseract.image_to_string()` can actually handle an image object, so there is no need to create a real file.
The assignment is to allow a user to enter the information as given examples of in the table. The user imput is then to be stored in a textfile. Next operation is to let the user search for a product in the textfile. I would also recommend using json as fileformat if you know it. Othervise just store information in a .txt file and use a special character to separate the product information. Good luck and have fun! :D 
Thanks!
Try anaconda/miniconda and conda installing. They take a lot of the compilation issues out of it.
Yes I'll raise that issue soon. The problem arises because the management staff approves these events and sends the registration links to them through email to few students in the class committee (about 3 students for 500 people) These students screenshots the email and circulate them on WhatsApp/Facebook. I've asked these students to copy the text of the mail but they don't do it telling "Screenshots our proof that it's coming from right authority, if we copy the text any one could edit it and redirect you to somewhere else" (sometimes these links are payment gateways) And thanks for the feedback I just learnt about tempfile! 
Your options are to install anaconda, canopy, sage, use docker, install linux as dual boot, buy a macbook or suffer through manually compiling C libs on windows. Your choice, I know which I would pick...
Put it on PyPI first
On second reading of the assignment, I actually think it's alot easier. First: hardcode a file with the gtin-8, desc and price for different products. - use json format or make up your own. Then the program to develop is just a search program. User enters arbitrary number of gtin-8 numbers with quantity for each product. Then The program searches the hardcoded file for matching gtin8 products, calculates prices and gets the description Then finally creates the output shown in table. 
It's definitely cheaper then California, I grew up out there and I don't know how people can survive out there
Thanks for the feedback
Where could you put one that a def couldn’t go?
Lol sure how about you teach us about common courtesy after complaining about a free project
Yes, I thought about it, but I was looking for something more efficent
At least we don’t have to include `return` like PHP. 
I don't know how to avoid reading the screen with pyautogui. However there are other GUI automation systems like AutoIt, or operating system APIs.
Thank you! I'll check it
I am sure you did your research. But I was thinking that wouldn’t the images be inside the &lt;a&gt; tags. You could have just scraped for it and found the links. Your thoughts..,
Yeah, I just cringed too much about that video + incorrect sub combination. But got to give credit where credit is due, I held nothing personal against him.
i didn't complain. it's unfortunate you see it that way
I would like to know more about the aforementioned "dead code." Does it get highlighted. And does it work through the latest PEPs..?
not too shabby on mobile. Some icons are misaligned with text, but it's not terrible. (I only looked at the homepage—I didn't click any links.)
The editor is using vulture. You have to install it with -&gt; pip3 install vulture.... If you use it with the Codeview window the cursor moves to the selected position. PEP feature (using pycodestyle) works similiar... 
We type "lambda" every time. It's a net net. 
Thank you!
They shouldn't be out of place. Functions are first class objects in python, lambda's are largely just syntactic sugar on functions declarations. The syntax is the issue. Arrow functions in JavaScript feel much nicer. 
So far i have got a program that ask for 7 digits then tells them the check digit and if its valid or not. So now il slowlly follow your steps and write it.
because things are hard and you havent provided it yet
That doesn't work quite properly - if two insertions happen very close one after another, their key could be the same, meaning that one value would be lost. Also, using a dictionary is just needless overhead, you don't need fast lookup. Better go with lists and tuples: import time class TimedList(object): def __init__(self, limit=30): self.data = [] # [(timestamp, value), ..] self.limit = limit def append(self, value): self.purge() self.data.append((time.time(), value)) def get(self): self.purge() return [b for a, b in self.data] def purge(self): self.data = [(a, b) for a, b in self.data if a &gt; time.time() - self.limit] 
Yep, that what I was thinking about. I think purge method should be rewritten using pop or maybe even del if I want to keep a minimum thread-safety
&gt; I want to download one package in which i find cython and all i need to run it. and I want a bus filled to the brim with swedish models to show up at my doorstep. What's your point? Cython REQUIRES a working C compiler environment as a pre-requisite, just like it needs a computer to run on, and electricity supplied by the electric company, etc. etc. Your wishes and desires have no bearing whatsoever on this fundamental fact. On windows that means a multi-gig install of Visual Studio BEFORE you can install/run cython. On OSX that means a multi-gig install of Xcode. On Linux that means a full install of the GNU GCC or CLANG development/build tools (which I believe is also multiple gigs once you add everything up). Modern compilers come in big packages! &gt; so that i dont have to seach trough all of stackoverflow RTFM. Install visual studio, run pip install cython in your venv, and it should all work (source: I've done it dozens of times). Not sure why you are trying to read rando tea leaves on stack overflow. &gt; download gigabytes of crap i dont need and want but you DO need it, and most importantly even if it made sense to host compilers as dependencies on pypi (hint : it's not... it's a python package manager, not a system package manager!), it would never be allowed under copyright law (i.e. third parties such as pypi cannot legally distribute visual studio or xcode!). It's like saying "but i *want* the pyexcel pypi package to also install microsoft excel for me!"
Qt applications are usually a lot of work, good work. Have you considered distributing an executable of your application (perhaps using Pyinstaller)?
If you need actual thread-safety, then you can't rely on `pop`, you need a real mutex. Like: import threading, time class TimedList(object): def __init__(self, limit=30): self.data = [] # [(timestamp, value), ..] self.limit = limit self.mutex = threading.Lock() def append(self, value): self.purge() with self.mutex: self.data.append((time.time(), value)) def get(self): self.purge() with self.mutex: return [b for a, b in self.data] def purge(self): with self.mutex: self.data = [(a, b) for a, b in self.data if a &gt; time.time() - self.limit] 
Thanks :-) I may, it's not decided yet, I may go for asyncio or good'ol threads, not sure yet
Any chance we can take a look at it?
Sure thing [https://bugs.python.org/file48014/Timeout.py](https://bugs.python.org/file48014/Timeout.py) Let me know if you think there's anything wrong with it :D
`map` is lazily evaluated, which means you can "prime" it with data that may never need to be executed.
Where do you see that? Oh... I got it - Thanks! I tend to fixate on one test at a time. Coding some other tests would have helped. Or trying a different test first would have helped too.
That's true, but in general, the image links are usually inside of &lt;img&gt; tags. It's best practice to use &lt;a&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you want to make an image also a link. 
Feedback != a complaint
Well you have a bunch of choices: https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/InstallingOnWindows Here are some unofficial binaries: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython 
i don't know their exact name, but that is also true of the "list comprehensions" in parens rather than brackets.
Your art, is the best art, out of all the art. But seriously this is cool. And MIT license! I may have to find a fun use for this.
very cool project to improve skills with
What does it spit out? Just the HTML?
Its not appropriate for extremely large data sets because it loads everything into memory. That’s your biggest enemy. Using things like Apache spark to narrow down your data set before using pandas or analyze it in chunks 
No, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even images.
No? ???
I mean it is capable of downloading everything, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images.
I mean it is capable of downloading everything, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Images.
Damn this is way better than I was expecting. I'd use this over IDLE any day 😅
I got really frustrated once from pandas changing the data type of things seemingly arbitrarily. When building features for machine learning, the categorical ID of "1" is very different than the integer 1. Plus, adding a null in any of the rows will then cast *all* of the integers to floats so even if you map them back to strings you could end up with "1.0"
Pandas is optimal for a fixed data set. Adding rows to a dataframe is very slow because each add requires a complete copy of the entire dataframe. For this reason it is not well suited for streaming data. 
Even dynamically loaded content?
So like wget?
Can anyone post some screenshots?
I agree. Pandas is not suitable for real-time data processing, it's just too slow. In general I feel like pandas is not something you should use in production environments, but I would love it if someone could prove me wrong.
When the package is too large relative the benefit you're getting from it. That's the main reason for me. Also, as a library developer that supports pandas, the API also isn't as stable as I'd like. It's good for the devs, but not so good when the code I wrote 6 years ago (and isn't even for me) stops working. I still have no idea how to swap out the Panel for an xarray (which is another optional package that pandas can use).
You can kind of "stream" a dataframe using the chunksize parameter, see e.g. here (first link I found on google): https://cmdlinetips.com/2018/01/how-to-load-a-massive-file-as-small-chunks-in-pandas/ Using that parameter you can iterate through chunks of a file without loading the whole thing into memory at once.
That’s a great resource, thank you!
Well done README! I like lots of examples and you provide them. I was also looking for a way to enumerate fonts and found that in the CLI section. Nice.
No LICENSE file?
For personal UX knowledge growth Ive found ["Hello Web Design"](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-design/) book pretty useful and approachable. Would recommend to take a look.
When load time is an issue. That import time is pretty heavy IMO. I also tend to avoid it when doing simplistic transforms - having to deal with an index doesn’t feel natural to me. In those cases, I use PETL (pure python library). 
Rent, with roommates... for life.
Site uses form login, javascript on demand query to some backend data source to iterate through posts/images/whatever have to scroll to the end of the page to activate the load of the next data segment. objects are in nested hash directories with final files named &lt;128bithash&gt;.filetype all webhost indexing and error pages are disabled. Lets say I login for you and generate a cookie to make it easier. can you load that up to bypass login? how about if my webserver only returns pages if i recognize your UA?
Don’t some of those open source licensed libraries you’re using require your source to be distributed as well?
I also it used for small, simple data transforms when regular Python would be faster because of the sample size and low workload.
Pandas is 100% suitable for a production environment for the right task. This may seem like a shameless plug, but I created this library because my need was for DataFrames that could expand in size quickly. If that is your use case check it out: [https://github.com/rsheftel/raccoon](https://github.com/rsheftel/raccoon)
I had to mute it 
Why would I use this instead of PyCharm?
How the fuck can an IDE be "cute"?
To be fair, there's a lot of good tools you can use for writing Python code. My personal recommendation is Sublime text, but if you're looking for something more versatile, use atom or Pycharm community
Have you looked at numexpr? Or perhaps z3py? Seems 'um might lend a foot up.
I haven't seen a screenshot but perhaps they are referring to OP building their own IDE?
This sounds amazing, Thank you!
With data where delimiters are used in text fields. With large data sets. 
I'd set the openfile into a variable, eg. txt = openfile() etc. At this point print the contents see if it's working. I'd also look to prevent the send if the contents is with null or an empty string.

I'm curious too, I've bumped it
As a introvert I could never do that lol
It's an IDE on your phone.....? Why would anyone ever write from their phone?

As far as I know, the only thing that exist for GPGPU with AMD is OpenCL. I remember going through a lot of pain just to install the required drivers on my linux machine (yes, you need additional drivers to compile your kernels). If you're using Windows I think this step is a lot easier. No idea about MacOS. Now when I was toying around with OpenCL I programmed everything in C, so bear in mind that I have no idea if the following link is any good: [http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/easy-opencl-with-python/240162614](http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/easy-opencl-with-python/240162614). Good luck. you **will** need it. Or just switch to nvidia/CUDA if you have any chance to do so.
Pythonista is on sale is until 26th. If you write python code and have and ipad/iphone you should consider getting it. Because with it you have the power of the Python standard library and that of many external libraries (like requests!) in your pocket. Pythonista comes with it's own GUI creator. With it, you can write an app for your phone on your phone, no Mac computer required. While it is a lot of hassle to actually type code on a phone screen, you can connect a bluetooth keyboard to write code and then run this code without. Via the author's twitter you can also get the current beta version free Test Flight version. https://twitter.com/olemoritz But at the current price it's probably easier to just get it. 
You can just use pyinstaller to create an executable of PYQT5 apps, I do it all the time.
it's not so much about writing code on your phone, more like the ability to run python code on the phone, without having to buy a Mac. I use it to write small scripts that pull data from web sources or activate home automation
The utility of this tool is highly questionable. 
Glad this was left up otherwise I might not have found out about this. Never heard of it before but it looks extremely powerful with built in libraries that access quite a lot of iOS functionality. I just wrote a quick script that uploads an image from the share dialog to Google reverse image search and shows the results in browser, something I had been wanting for a long time. Very cool!
Do you... have the project open in itself in the screenshot?
I use pycharm
It's not going to blow up on you, it's just not a particularly good practice, mostly for style reasons. 
small functions that are right there, they are neat
Of course I immediately thought of this 2013 joke image: https://i.imgur.com/u5hnxTt.png
So, pretty much ALWAYS? Got it. Dynamic types make Python and Pandas a non-starter for my colleagues and I.
I like it. It won’t convince me to move (at this point, my .vimrc is so large I don’t think anything could) from vim but I’ll definitely give it a go. 
Another retarded feature that nobody wants/will use. Thanks python, you lived up to everyone's expectations. I'll gladly stick with 2.x
Hey, that’s fair enough. And massive kudos to you for taking on such a huge and complicated project on your. Sorry for the negative tone. I really like the layout with focus on the code, and the features are really nice, but I probably won’t be switching from my current IDE just yet ;-)
Why not something free like qpython?
Its a feature rich app with GUI and iOS specific tools so theres there's lots of possibilities, every now and again an idea/solution comes to mind and its great to pull out and test with if your not near a computer/computer with dev tools installed. If your chilling in a cafe, on a break or have some time to kill you can bring it out and start playing with different ideas or even start a project that you can then export later. The app makes it really easy to use and its not of tedious or fiddly as it would seem
pandas is inappropriate if you are doing anything beyond exploratory data analysis. 
did you created that?
[It's already been covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a8vebd/check_out_my_new_python_ide/eceib7t/) :)
Vscode isn't half bad either.
I just looked and I found some python bindings for vulkan. You can create compute kernels with that. There are plenty of tutorials on Vulkan but I’m not sure how many focus on compute.
`function (x) {return x+1;}` Vs `lambda x: x+1` It’s not a huge difference, but is not just the same. 
It's written in Python?
That's not a good reason?
Pandas is ideal for data science. This is because it's dataframe utilities are good for storing large amounts of data. They are also easy to use, and it comes with a lot of built in tools that make data science easier. 
yes
What data type is preferred for streaming?
You want to look up "longest common substring". The relevantstandard library is difflib. 
Okay. Know any free courses?
The OP answered it here https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a8vebd/check_out_my_new_python_ide/ece369p?utm_source=reddit-android
For some definition of "full conversation" then yes. [They're still arguing whether or not the turing test has been passed.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27762088)
I mean you can, but everyone else is dropping 2.x support. I happen to like bug fixes and new features. Otherwise, I’d still be using Python 2.4. It worked, but do you realize how much of a pain to be supporting a code you wrote 8 years ago that has bugs in the libraries that are now fixed? Thankfully, that one finally got ported to python 2.7 by removing hacks in various 3rd party libraries. My open source projects final 2.7 release is coming soon. There is a unicode bug in 2.7 for it that I don’t see the point in fixing.
I wouldn’t say it’s ideal given the large memory overhead. It’s actually bad for big data. It’s got some convenient tools.
How else would they develop this? Time travel. 
For me at least when I search the App Store for terms like, “Python”, “Python IDE”, “Python Compiler” etc. QPython doesn’t show up anywhere in the results so I’ve only used the free apps like Python Program Compiler, Python Offline and Python3IDE and they’re all quite limited in what they can do and you hit their limitations very quickly. Just had a quick play with it but I would avoid it for the main reason of it made my phone run stupidly hot after a minute of use, it’s actually gotten uncomfortable to hold my phone. From what I could quickly see as I don’t want to risk damage to my phone, there doesn’t appear to be any modules so you can’t import things like numpy and you also don’t seem to be able to import your own created py files, however there’s a number of IAPs but I can’t find them in the app so maybe you can pay to unlock extra features but they’re not labelled properly in the App Store. Not to much of an issue but it’s still scaled for iPhone 6 so on iPhone X and above there’s large black bars to the top and bottom of the screen, there’s also very limited keyboard control so typing is actually a chore, with Pythonista it’s autocomplete makes typing really fast and efficient. For whatever reason it also has a QR reader but when it asks for camera permission part of the dialog box is in Chinese which raises my conspiracy theory suspicions haha Not sure why I rambled this into a review of the app :/
AFAIK, there are exactly 3 ways of portably doing arbitrary computation on a GPU: * OpenGL with a compute shader * Vulkan * OpenCL Just use OpenCL.
Consider using [subcommands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands) rather than ordinary flags, if you always have to specify exactly one of them.
I think it would have been better if you said, "Can you provide build instructions?" instead. The original sounds a bit condescending, imo.
That looks like an interesting way to split up the functionality I intend to implement - Thanks!
You can't prepend to a file. You need to read the entire file, then write your value and then its previous contents.
Is Dask better in this regard?
Ok, I'll be the retard to ask: How do I install/run it? Instructions for Mac OS or Ubuntu will be appreciated. 
Pandas is slow (compared to Numpy, or to low-level langs), but 'production' is too ambiguous to address what this means.
That looks pretty impressive. How long have you worked on this?
Use a Dev.txt for your development packages. 
Hey, thanks. That's a simple solution.
I would love to use vscode (especially for cpp &amp; python; it works amazingly well out of the box and seems very extensible), but....well... microsoft.

That's a shit reason not to use something
I have used PyOpenCL from time to time with AMD GPUs it works well. The only problem with PyOpenCL is it is low level but you will have 100% control of the GPU.
You can even reference your other requirements files and install them all in one command of you put: -r requirements.txt At the top of your Dev.txt
dude, that's rad! 
This reminds me of how the c compiler is written in c.
Check out [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium). They compile the open-source VSCode source and remove telemetry and stuff. Not sure how the plugins work on it though.
There's also pypy. Python interpreter written in python.
You can't even give constructive feedback without getting jumped...
I mean, nobody says you have to. I love JetBrains IDEs and nobody forces you to use this, PyCharm even has an open-source version which you can use and modify. OP just felt like releasing their own IDE.
In that case, I'll stick to CPython, thanks for the info/heads up!
I've found this too. Every single time I go to use map or filter, I find myself not liking the way it looks and rewriting it as a comprehension. I did some quick tests on performance (like mapping str() to only the evens in a list of ints) and it appears the comprehensions are faster. That could vary from case to case though.
Awesome. I am glad to have a way to automate that, it's annoying to install it by command line every time
OK.... You must have python3. Use pip to get: pyqt5, qsci, vulture, pycodestyle. In the terminal: $ python3 crosscobra.py 
Ok my dude, I followed your instructions. Here's the error I'm getting: &gt; $ python3 crosscobra.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "crosscobra.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; from PyQt5.QtWidgets import (QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, ImportError: dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/QtWidgets.so, 2): Symbol not found: __os_log_default Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt/lib/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore (which was built for Mac OS X 10.11) Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt/lib/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore
One more voice: it's not *bad*, yeah, it's just that it has no benefit over a one-line `def`... def butcall(action=bname): return showtime(action) ...and in fact is arguably worse: the lambda's `__name__` attribute, if used, will show `'&lt;lambda&gt;'` rather than `'butcall'`
OK... It has some problems to import pyqt5 Widgets .... Pyqt5 programs work on your pc? ? I have tested it on linux not ? What OS are you working on? Windows? Mac?
Pipes wouldn't make much sense. They're not used in even a remotely-similar manner anywhere else in Python. I'd be very much in favor of JS-style arrow functions, though, *especially* since `-&gt;` is already a thing for return-type annotations in py3: `x -&gt; x +1`, `(x, y) -&gt; x + y`
Hard to grok? The only opaque thing is the word "lambda" itself, but the concept of an anonymous function is totally logical
`lambda` has been in since Python version 1.0. Anonymous functions are a very-solidly-established thing across languages -- Python did not invent the idea.
In a list is an example he gives in the video above. 
Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Ok, I get different errors with different versions of Pyqt5 though. 
Between this list and the constant "mahmoud starred X" on my github feed I'm pretty sure you're indirectly responsible for introducing me to most projects I've found lol. Thanks for compiling this
Good idea....
"well... microsoft"?? What is this, the 90s?

an option is to use pipenv: `pipenv install pylint --dev`
To do what?
I don't have a preference for IDE so I'll give it a go 
Besides being unsuitable for some operations, Pandas is also inappropriate for datasets that won't fit in memory. H2O is one workaround because it can be run in distributed mode (on a cluster). Another option you might like to explore is Dask. 
&gt; Plus, adding a null in any of the rows will then cast **all** of the integers to floats I haven't had a chance to check this out yet but... http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/whatsnew/v0.24.0.html#optional-integer-na-support
Not true. I have generated reports/analyses in a production setting with Pandas. 
I'd recommend: Head first python a smarter way to learn python. 
This is really clean nice work!
https://build-system.fman.io makes it extremely easy to deploy PyQt5 apps. If you're worried about decompilation, use a code obfuscater on your Python code before you freezing. But in reality, it's usually not needed.
Fucking well summarized!
What would you consider too large? Obviously this depends on available RAM but it would be good to get an idea of where the line is.
Lol vim is no where close to pycharm
are you 12?
Folium looks great. and its well documented. Just didnt want to tie myself to one package like Bokeh, Seaborn, Plotly since it would be an investment. But folium is good that its interactive and its easy to save the map, js, and data to an html. &amp;#x200B;
A lot of languages get rewritten in themselves. C# as well IIRC.
I see a surprising amount of hate for the current syntax of lambda here... As a beginner it was much easier to search for "python lambda" when I saw one than to search for "python {}" or something like that. I remember how painful it was when I was learning perl to get useful results from Google because of the arcane syntax that wasn't easy to search for. Good syntax isn't just short. If it were we'd all be still coding in assembly. Good syntax is self evident. And when it isn't, it's easily searched imo.

If your trying to write to an Unformatted drive, that would be low level work that could probably be done, but python would not be an appropriate language. Is there a specific reason you want to work with un formatted drives? Unless your trying to build something for like data recovery it doesn’t seem like a good thing to do. As for thumb drives. They all come formatted Fat32 by default. 
Right, but then the author of the project doesn't learn that build instructions are an expected part of distribution. 
[configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) is your friend.
Very nice! If I might make one suggestion -- I noticed a lot of your code is just setting styleSheets for each widget. To make it more readable, editable, extensible, etc. you might want to place all your styleSheet settings into one text file and set the styleSheet for the whole app where you instantiate QApplication. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47621172/applying-styles-to-pyqt-widgets-from-external-stylesheet)'s a PyQt5 example from Stackoverflow. [Here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html) is the relevant Qt5 documentation. (Let me know how it goes cos I'd like to try this myself at some point). : )

True
I still don't understand. Please explain it better, thanks
since you're asking for feedback: PEP8 and style violations (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): * indent with 4 spaces. not 2. and NEVER alternate between 2, 4, or any other number (`get_source` is indented with 4. `GetWebSite` is indented with 2 * `###########` is unnecessary line noise * You don't need blank lines following class, method, and function names * there are many more. just read the link and reformat your code Other suggestions for improvements: * classes are typically nouns: `GetWebSite --&gt; WebSite`. also Website is a word so `WebSite --&gt; Website` * there are too many comments. The conventional wisdom is that comments should explain *why* something was done. the code itself should explain what was done. Comments that explain what something is or what it does are considered code smell because you now have two things to maintain and two things to read instead of one. For example: # bad: # Find all link tags self.all_link_tags = self.source_bs.findAll('link',{'rel':'stylesheet'}) self.urls = [] # This list will hold all links (link) for i in self.all_link_tags: ... # better: all_link_tags = self.source_bs.findAll('link',{'rel':'stylesheet'}) all_links = extract_links(all_link_tags) * getters should not set values or create any other surprising side effects (more generally, methods and functions should not do more than their name describes). * python provides `@property` annotations that let you treat methods like class properties, so instead of `get_css`, you could decorate a method named `css` and it would appear to be a property when it is actually a computed value * variables that are intermediate values or only used locally (all_link_tags, link, css_urls, etc) do not need to be class properties. * `get_css` and `get_js` are virtually identical. look for ways to abstract this functionality * again: DO NOT MIX INDENTATION LEVELS * did you just copy different parts of this code from random sources? * blanket catch blocks are generally a bad idea. if it's not a bad idea for your use case, explain why in a comment I've gotta get ready for work
Nothing to see here, just some low rent SPAM. Report this user and move along.
Hi. I was a novice just like you a few days ago. And I started getting hold of a few datasets and doing small data viz projects. PM me. And take a look at my [Projects](http://bidyutchanda.github.io/recentprojects) for a better insight into them. I have done a few small data viz projects on Kaggle and also those datasets are uploaded on the website too :) 
Also pycharm is nowhere close to vim. They are both very complex and powerful and in general trying to do different things. When you try to get one to be the other it will come up short... because they are different and each have their strengths.
They seem to have foot this right though. A lot of ppl are quite happy with it including me. 
I'd look to see what the pyqt5 instructions are for other applications like Spyder (for example) to see what you need in general to run pyqt5 source in a Mac dev environment.
Dude! Good shit! I learned python in my intro to Cs class at my uni but I never felt I learned enough to make an actual product.. I’m learning Python via Lynda and then the plan is to learn flask and web scraping People like you inspire me to learn it even more so kudos :) 
Please read better, thanks
If you were a novice a few days ago, you’re still a novice

Entirely dependent on situation. In a very general sense: If I couldn't get the data I needed for a task to fit in memory in pandas, even after being smart about typing, I'd look at dask to operate on chunks at a time. If that was performing to slowly, it would be a sign to add processing power (spark, dask.distributed) or redesign.
Also [mako](https://www.makotemplates.org/) could be useful. 
If you’re interested in deep learning, I invite you to try implementing a neural network from scratch in pure NumPy using a basic optimization algorithm like vanilla gradient descent/SGD. This necessitates manually writing out a backward pass, which TensorFlow/PyTorch/Keras will spare you from but it familiarizes you with backprop and update rules at a granular level and will make you more comfortable with NumPy operations. 
Your link suggests it needs a FFT (Fourier transformation) so maybe start there? Numpy for example can do that for you 
I suspect it was not really clear to the author of that sentence what he/she actually ment to say...
I used to use Sublime Text, but I found the debugging horribly lacking, and switched to Pycharm.
you can install vim plugin on Pycharm though
It's talking about how you can organize your code. Very basically, _functions_ can be grouped together as _methods_ within a _class_, and _classes_ can be grouped together within a _module_, while _modules_ can be grouped together into a _package_. So `package.module.class.method` describes the hierarchy of a top-level _namespace_ ... a method is in a class is in a module is in a package.
Za
What they are doing is basically: • Take the signal from the motor • See what frequencies make up this signal (Fourier transform, basically how you would combine sinus waves of different frequencies to make up the signal you have) • Find the dominant frequency, which is the main signal to the motor • Remove this from the original signal, leaving only the deviations from the normal behavior. • Check for things not working properly, which can be seen as peaks in the frequency domain. You should be good with some FFT and doing the rest by yourself (at least it does not seem all to tricky). Best of luck!
@t1ll thanks for pointer. I don't know Fourier transformation but that is a starting point. 
This idea seems good. Can you suggest me a blog or a tutorial I can follow? That would be really great. Thanks 
arrrgh crap, it don't preserve comments. but thanks. I'm looking at ConfigObj
&gt; You made this? &gt; I made this

It is indeed faster because *map* makes a call for every item in the iterable, which introduces overhead, whilst generator/comprehension code is just looped over.
ok so we established why Pandas is innapropriate...but what is a good alternative?

Numpy and matplotlib. You can use these two lib to calculate and output the spectrum diagram as in the article. If you have no expertise in electrical engineering, I don't think you can do more than that. Just output the calculation and let the engineers do the real diagnosis.

I’m just gonna ask you here since I don’t have an account on your forum: Is there documentation for the beta modules? I wanted to play around with the cursor movement but only found out it wants an integer. 
Are we just linking /r/learnpython on every thread now...? What does this clearly-non-learning-related topic have to do with /r/learnpython?
No but, other than security, little has changed. Can't change visuals without hacks because reasons. Can't install latest build to support cool stuff like bash because reasons. Can't update when I want because reasons. Their newest Linux distribution costs money. The experience working on a Ms machine feels very bogged down. Yet, still, asking Cortana about the nearest disco yields no results.

Sounds like your school could do with some kind of official portal to advertise these events. Then the email could link to the portal and the portal contains the link to the payment gateways etc. That way people would know they weren't being scammed.

You're getting towards visualisation first, then ML after I think would be good progression. I've just finished making a dashboard in Jupyter notebook with Pandas and numpy, with matplotlib or plotly graphs (are prettier) from an API. Maybe you could find a use case that you like yourself or is useful, then transfer data into dataframes, pull out the columns and data you want, play with it, make relations between columns eg. If is on a weekday, is blue and has a number higher than 20 then it's a "Winner" or whatever, graph this, and other Winnners, losers, best days, worst days for something etc, dashboard it up. This will give you good practice and give you an accomplishment at the end. Make sure to write out all the ideas you want initially on a plan, then work towards this and then you'll get practice of overcoming problems you face, rather than following a tutorial that is essentially the easy path. Then...maybe afterwards, you could use a data set to put in an indicator in your dashboard of like a "best day to buy" that you've found from ML prediction models of a stat that is 95% or 98% confident etc. Have fun!

But is it more efficient. Than PyPy or RPython?
I implemented the basic ML course of Andrew NG using numpy. Here is the [Neural Network](https://git.io/fhUGE) implementation. A tutorial isn't quite necessary tbh, try converting the code you worked on in the octave/matlab exercise of the course to python and you're set :)
I think this book is quite good: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
I realize that it might not be exactly what you're asking but I always enjoyed physics projects, such as simulating a double pendulum or simple molecular dynamics. The physics/math is not more difficult than neural networks and some quite cool visualizations are possible. I also think it's worth trying to do for example the molecular dynamics project with and without numpy to understand more about when/why numpy is useful. 
Of course it is. Try to run PyPy or RPython with 4K of heap (right, kilobytes). 
/r/learnpython Read about virtualenv and start using it as it will keep your deps separated from your default host installation and will allow you to work with multiple versions of the same library if needed. 
We always have 3: requirements.txt requirements-test.text requirements-dev.txt Before anyone else talks about pipenv. Yes, but the above is more convenient when creating docker containers when the test container needs more commands regardless of the python code. 
From the FAQ: &gt; After I lost commit access to the main repository, I continue my work here. This leads to the following question: why did you lose access / why don't you open pull requests upstream?
Ok so it serves the same purpose as Micropython, thought it would perhaps be more efficient in terms of time etc.
Primary focus is on efficiency overlooked by other implementations - memory efficiency. That provides solid base to work on other efficiencies, like runtime efficiency. People sitting on gigahertz and gigabyte boxes may not appreciate need for any efficiency at all, that's why e.g. both PyPy and RPython are much less known than CPython. But as soon as someone would want to use Python on kilobyte/megahertz boxes (or simply use Python anywhere, not caring if it's kilobytes or gigabytes), the problem shows up. And unfortunately PyPy and RPython are of no help there. While Pycopy/MicroPython is, and definitely strives to go in the same direction as RPython and PyPy do - but again, with orders of magnitude less memory used up. 
Wouldn't that pin my Python version and its pip packages at a specific version, for example 3.7? I mean I want to know what's the best way to upgrade everything to lastest without breaking the compatibility.
Yes! unless you buy the license, then it's ok for you to distribute your application as closed-source.
Glad that pyinstaller works well with PyQt5. But I your source code secure enough though.
Thank you for your submission, I'll be taking a close look at it soon.
&gt;I used to use Sublime Text, but I found the debugging horribly lacking, and switched to Pycharm. `$ pip install pudb` `import pudb; pudb.set_strace()`
That makes sense. I thought maybe Python internally could optimize that away when dealing with lambda functions, but even in that case it would have to do the optimization step which would add a little overhead at the beginning.
And since you said you're targeting Linux, also check out https://build-system.fman.io/linux-gui-programming.
The only problem with this is the fact that our time is finite
Python is absolutely the appropriate language for this, and for almost anything else. f = open("/dev/hdb", "rb", buffering=0) buf = bytearray(512) f.readinto(buf)
If you're doing this on Windows there are much better ways. You can find elements of a GUI directly by Name/ID, don't use screen coordinates. Look into: - [UIAutomation](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/desktop/WinAuto/uiauto-entry-uiautoclientsforwin32apps) - [AutoIt PowerShell Module](https://www.autoitconsulting.com/site/scripting/autoit-cmdlets-for-windows-powershell/) - Appium Also, on Windows, this is far easier with PowerShell or C#/C++ than Python. Not saying don't go ahead If you really feel like you must, but PowerShell especially is literally purpose-built to automate Windows-stuff and even comes pre-installed on every Windows PC. Also, if you're trying to automate a Website use Selenium for that. If it's for Linux/macOS I don't know sorry

I use Cython to compile a few PyQt5 modules in one of my projects. It has was worked well in my limited use case, and you sometimes get a 50% speed boost by simply compiling with Cython. I have toyed with the idea of trying to compile the whole app but have not been that motivated. 
But...why?

Definitely agree with you here. So many print statements... 😢 
I'll just point out that I used the "unofficial precompiled binaries" for years and never once had a problem. Highly recommended, and certainly vastly superior to having to download some massive version of Visual Studio just to build some possibly trivial piece of code.

When I created this, it wasn't a library. I wasn't aware of other existing libraries at that time. I was using it for one of my projects. Currently I aim for this library to be focussed on providing more customization as compared to other similar tools.
The CPython developers are typically very conservative. I remember posting a one-line patch for bug fix on their bug tracker, and it took several years for the core devs to agree to include it (don't worry, it was a very minor bug). And from what I can gather, my experience is pretty typical. At a bare minimum, you won't get a new feature into CPython unless you've already published it as a PyPI module, and it's seen widespread usage (that's the standard path for additions to the standard library), so you should start by doing that. 
Never used it myself but people regard it highly
Yeah they have it somewhere in their guide that 2 years is a typical timespan
&gt;For this reason it is not well suited for streaming data. Just chunk it. 
Uhh... I need to compile it again :/ When you will provide precompiled DEBs?

What are the differences between it and MicroPy is the question I guess
Should I update python every time there's an update like this? Or should I just wait until 3.8 is fully released? I'm sure it depends on the situation but I'm not working on any large, long-term projects just yet so it may be good to just stay up to date
&gt; I mean I want to know what's the best way to upgrade everything to latest without breaking the compatibility. This gets super awkward. Consider that if you're developing, you'd probably want to test your code against several versions of python, plus have at least one standard development environment per project. The strength of virtualenvs is that you can install as many python versions as you want, and make as many environments per python version as you want, and you can test the reproducibility of your builds and it takes next to no effort to trash one environment and recreate it (also for you to run others' code, and others to run yours). You would need to manage each environment's upgrades individually, but it's just not that big of a deal IMO, compared to the hassle of not using virtualenvs.
Will GIL be ever removed from CPython?

No, when your venv is active, pip will download the packages to the venv directory. I think the interpreter binary is symlinked though.
Have you tried mixing all 5 into one bowl? 
Get dataset from field you like and/or seems important to you like sport, poverty, etc. and just play with it :) If you're willling ot learn some web scraping and a bit of database I think great project is to scrape data, build pipeline to db(and clean data along the way) and the build some real time prediction system/algorithm even if it's very naive. I believe that you need to get you hands dirty to realy get to know these libraries and you'll get some feeling what kind of work is done in industry. Or just pick dataset from kaggle or any other data scource(APIs etc.). Data acquisition is very import in and judgment about data quality "real life". When I started I was very lost what to do, but after some time in industry I realized the only important thing is to just pick data from field you like or for some noble cause.

Is this useful when working on Jupyter Notebook? Because in my mind Jupyter loads everything at once, and that's it?
Wow, and you waited for patch release to ask that..
That's up to you of course, but I upgrade when * there's a new feature that will *significantly* make my life easier * security updates/issues fixed * a library I use isn't supported in the "old" version * a major release comes out (this is iffy; sometimes it takes libs a while to get on board) These rules of thumb aren't hard and fast, but those are the typical motivators. I tend to be in the fat part of the bell curve of adoption on stuff like this; it's fun to be on the bleeding edge, but it can be bloody there too and often I just want my shit to work.
Yeah, I usually like to hold off on updates because things break and there may not be documentation. Like I said, I'm not doing anything super intense so I don't feel the need to hiiii phrase just yet. I'll keep the librarily updates and everything else in mind for sure though, thanks!
yeah kind of a staple in singapore
It depends. Are you working on a large project that requires a specific version? You can handle different versions using virtual environments, but it may be easier to stay on a specific version until the project is ready to support the new version. Your CI/CD should be able to test multiple versions. But it usually takes a while for the docker images for the new version of python to be available. There could be other libraries your project uses that fail on the new python version. So start with tests. Add the new python version to your automated tests and see if it passes. When it’s passing consistently then talk to the community using your project and see if people are ready to upgrade. if this is in a production environment you may also want to wait for security reviews. If you are the only one using your projects and tests are passing then I would definitely upgrade.

I'm honestly just teaching myself still at this point. I'm working on some more advanced topics (I think, I may just not know what I don't know) but yeah it's just me. I have a couple of scripts at work I use from time to time that I doubt would break if I upgrade.
Very smart people are working hard on this, however it's harder than it sounds. Also a GIL-less Python will probably be marked as Python 4 since it will break backwards compatibility :) 
Ya then upgrade and see if it breaks your libraries. Since it’s a patch I doubt it will break anything. The point releases are more likely to break stuff. This is a good time to see why writing tests are important. You should write tests even for your own little scripts. It’s intimidating at first but it’s actually really simple. Writing tests from the beginning will set you up with good coding habits.
Any good guides you'd recommend? 
I tried the comment out strategy which turned into a "whack a mole" problem of more and more imports failing. After the 4th of these I gave up. pip install qsci found nothing.
Hey there! First off, thanks for all the great work on this and micropython. I have been exploring the python concurrency scenario (or lack thereof) and been looking to write a proof of concept that implements Erlang style processes in python. Would you be interested in having such a superpower in this implementation?
“Hot dog, not hot” *great job btw but this thread needs this dropped 
There's a "fork FAQ" in README which gives high-level overview of things Pycopy is going to concentrate on: [https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython#fork-faq](https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython#fork-faq) (bottom). &amp;#x200B; Specifics can be seen via the commit log, which is now 120 commits on top of MicroPython master (and is rebased on it, so everything in MicroPython is also in Pycopy): [https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython/commits/pfalcon](https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython/commits/pfalcon?before=3fdab30b628ee041d9ee578e2f2200ba4cf20507+35) . I submit patches upstream, but the whole reason for the fork is a large slowdown of the upstream development. &amp;#x200B; As a specific example, Pycopy implements `__slots__` classes, which of course is important feature for a Python implementation focused on minimal memory usage.
Yes. The official docs only reflect the current version and the latest "stable" releases. So, if you managed to install 3.7.1, there's no point for you to keep *that*. Either go back to 3.6, or keep updating. But why did you decide to live with an intermediate release, even though you aren't a developer or a tester?..
I should say right away that one of Pycopy's aims in exactly to (hopefully) serve as a platform to experiment with new features/paradigms applied to the Python language. &amp;#x200B; However: 1. Myself personally, before experimenting with other "types of concurrencies", I'm keen to finish implementation, and make optimal, native Python concurrency system, asyncio. Well, MicroPython/Pycopy already strays away from it a bit, with its "uasyncio" (micro-asyncio) package. Again, reason for the fork is that I'm unable to continue uasyncio implementation/optimization work upstream. 2. I should admit that I'm not familiar enough with Erlang. But just as you, I'm keen to learn ;-). I just need to ration my learning with my hacking on something, and my hands are quite full. And well, I'm roughly familiar how async programming works across various languages, and the idea(s) is mostly the same everywhere, the difference mostly in the level of integration into language, and syntactic sugar. I would love to stand corrected and be taught about Erlang "superpowers" which make it a head above e.g. Python's asyncio. If you have links comparing two (or more) paradigms of different languages, please share. &amp;#x200B;
Oh, while I was writing reply, I see that you added a link. Will read it up and share any quick random thoughts. But again, if you have link specifically comparing Erlang vs Python asyncio, please share too.
Thanks for pointing me to the right sub. Didn't mean to bother anybody.
r/learnpython to get you started
Brew install to get python3 and 2, use those and pip2 pip3 from then on out. Highly recommend using virtualenv in python 2 and venv in python 3 to keep libraries orderly on your Mac. Also this will help you keep track of your dependencies later when you try to package something. For example my workflow for python 3 is to create a venv in the root directory of my project, exclude that directory from git and all project libraries are installed there with pip3. Easy peasy nice and clean.

First lesson, done
If you’re using specific frameworks like flask or Django the tutorials have a nice section on tests. You can google “Test Driven Development” (TDD) but[here’s a simple api wrapper example](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-and-testing-an-api-wrapper-in-python) that follows test driven development. I don’t think you have to follow test driven development all the time, but being able to think “how do I test this” is a core concept you need to be able to use. It also forces you to really understand better what your program is doing. 
Thanks, I'm actually working on a Django cert now!
OK... Seems to fail the import from qscintilla..... Try:. pip3 install qscintilla ....

A couple more pip installs and it worked! &amp;#x200B;

What? GPS is not an algorithm, it's a network of satellites sending positioning data in a publicly documented format, which receivers can use to determine their own position through triangulation. Apart from the low-level radio wave receiver part, pretty much all of the logic can be implemented in Python just fine. AFAIK, however, you would typically use a GPS receiver that does all the calculations in firmware, and just read back the position data with Python. So what exactlybis the project?
GPS? Global Positioning System? Google Play Services? General Particle Source? General Problem Solver? Generalized Processor Sharing? Why do you think there is anything special about python with respect to implementing any of these?
Honest question: Why use Brew over the Python.org installer?
How did you « trained» thanks?
huh ? templating ?
It's actually not hard to remove the GIL if you don't care about compatibility. The hard part is retaining compatibility. If they were going to break compat for the GIL, why? There's a zillion other Python interpreters you can use (like Jython) that already exist don't have a GIL.

Why not jusy use pyenv? Makes the compilation easy-ish
Thanks
 « You would typically use a GPS receiver that does all the calculations in firmware, and just read back the position data with Python. » Could you elaborate more on that if you may please ? 
Use pyenv. It's amazing if you're using a bunch of different python versions. [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
Why would it break backwards compatibility? I mean I'm sure it would. But which parts? I'd imagine only - C API - garbage collection - thread based garbage collection tricks which are dirty hacks anyway.
From what I’ve seen in a keynote a few years ago is mainly the Garbage Collector in combination with the Threading part. The C API can be somewhat maintained, but not really :)
I've used it to repeatedly change some values in the different input files. The input file's template looks like " .... .... ${parameter1} .... ${parameter2} ... ${parsmetern} ... " And mako easily writes the values from a dict with parameter names as keys to the right locations of the input files. Also supports loops etc.
Joel Grus has a live code *madness* that may help out with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw
I would highly recommend reading through this [online book](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/). It does a good job discussing how to use Numpy for vectorization and goes into how the Numpy memory model works. Understanding this and using it properly can have **huge** performance implications for your code. While we would like to approach Numpy as Python users and just ignore typing and memory handling, the reality is that Numpy requires you to think about your code from a C perspective. Each Numpy function/method call has implications about whether memory is allocated, whether temporaries are made, or whether conversions take place. Each of these carries with it a computational expense. Two different pieces of Numpy code that appear to do the same thing in Python can be wildly different in performance.
Automate the Boring Stuff. The book and the Udemy course.

I also came here for this comment.
If you buy a GPS receiver, it will do all the calculations for you. All you do is write code to ask it a the location. Jut use a python UBS library to talk to the USB GPS receiver using the instructions it comes with. However: 1) You need to do some calculations. For example if you get a spread of positions over a short time, is the user running back-and-forth or is just a lack of accuracy and a stationary user? 2) You can use something like a database of known Wifi signals to locate yourself without a GPS, very approximately - or to increase the precision or speed of a GPS. For example if you can detect 3 starbucks, a meat shack and "walkerton cafe" you can make a good guess from a map of "points of interest". By speed I mean it can take a GPS about 12 minutes to "acquire" so a lot of software will use wifis to get a rough initial fix.
I'm not sure? The last time I setup my laptop I already had brew there so I used that. I guess the official installer would work just the same?
Try to explain what you are trying to accomplish then people will have an easier time helping you. And put some words on what you know and have already done.
If you change the C API then you've broken all libraries that depend on it, such as numpy, psycopg2, really anything that needs to interop with another C-like library. Unfortunately they already broke that once before with python 2/3 and the community still hasn't fully recovered from the perception and PR hit.
Honestly, if you need multi-threading, you're better off using another language at this point. 
Looks cool. I wish I could test it out but I'm on my phone. I like the f-strings, they make it very readable.
I both want to know, and don't want to know, who's offering Django certifications.
Found a cheap one on Udemy. I don't know what the reputation they have is, but I like the course overall. I'm not great at teaching myself so being able to follow examples helps. I'm working on a project of my own now, and am not just following examples anymore.
Forgive me if this is a stupid question: Why do they continue to update 3.6 if 3.7 is out? 
&gt;Python 3.6.8 is planned to be the last bugfix release of Python 3.6. Per our support policy, we plan to provide security fixes for Python 3.6 as needed through 2021, five years following its initial release. This is a bug fix release for 3.6 which is necessary because not all projects can or will be updated to 3.7 but should be allowed to benefit from fixes for newly discovered security or performance issues, or bug removal. 
I stand corrected. Thank you! Although this works in Unix it looks like you can do “\\.\C:” in windows. 
This is what it generates: From this: data = [['ID', "Name", "Balance"], [], [98390, "Steve", 3200], [81042, "Bob", 100], [29002, "Kevin", 5000]] print(table(data, str.ljust)) &amp;#x200B;

R/learnpython
Qpython is on android, this is for iOS, where I’ve never seen anything free that’s usable.
It’s t’e very easy to make an argument when you don’t provide examples. Nope. Can’t be done. Google manages, but yours is special. And how does CI have anything to do with python specifically? All serious projects should have CI.
But why? It isn't funny...
Don’t you mean 3.7.0?
It’s almost always good to update to the latest minor release. That’s only really not the case for python 2.7 given the 11 year life. There’s a good chance your code would work fine, but I got hit by a change. Thankfully, that’s incredibly rare. Test it and you’re fine.
How is this different/better than the fixtures provided by Django already? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/initial-data/ Maybe add a use case or comparison section to your Readme.
Your phone is a phone. Mine is too...
I don’t think I’ll be able to write any. Maybe I’ll write one out myself...
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
&gt; Green, Preemptively switched I read up, and figured just that. Well, you know there're 2 extremes - true, OS-level preemptive threads, and cooperative threads, extra plus for explicitly (syntactically) marked switch-points (like Python has). Why OS-levelness is important for threads is well-known: supposed you issued a (system) call to read 1GB over 115200 baud serial connection. Only OS itself can preempt that, d'oh. Now, Erlang tries to find middle-ground between these 2 extremes. I wouldn't call it "superpower". In one word, I'd call it "cute". In 3 words, it would be "tangled mix of compromises". What's interesting is that MicroPython offers hooks to do that already. We don't count each VM instruction, as that's slow, but we count jump instructions. When user-defined downcounter is zero, we call arbitrary code. That's how ESP8266 port works actually - it uses ESP's cooperative OS in ROM, and calls back to it to process any pending events. That's why WiFi connection doesn't drop, even if you compute some deep Fibonacci. So, to implement a VM-level preemptive scheduler, you would need to just writeback cached bytecode IP, etc., put current code object back on the scheduling queue, take a next code object from it, and feed it into VM loop again. 
Thanks, now I'm hungry. 
Truth be told, I wrote this library first and foremost for Flask and SQLAlchemy, which doesn't have a "standard" solution to this problem (that I'm aware of, at least). I ended up getting a job using Django though, so I figured I'd add support for it. The primary differences I'm aware of are: - relationships in Django fixtures are represented by their primary key. For my library I chose to use an "identifier string" that looks like `ModelName(unique_key)`. Certainly it's more verbose, but IMO it makes for easier reading and writing of fixture files. - if I'm not mistaken, the out-of-the-box support for templating and faker is also unique. this makes it much easier to add a bunch of fake data quickly. But there are also some limitations: - my library doesn't (yet) support dumping from the database to fixture files - my library only supports YAML, and I don't think I have any plans otherwise, unless it becomes apparent that there's either an easier file format to work with or it's discovered there are restrictions from using YAML 
BUT WHO WAS BANANA
&gt;supposed you issued a (system) call to read 1GB over 115200 baud serial connection Erlang guys seem to solves this issue by this "Ports" thing. It's basically allots a separate OS level Thread/Process to do the actual I/O work, and gives the green processes a mailbox to read/write from it. Here is an image - &amp;#x200B; The Beam book is still a little short on it's exact implementation details, so have to look elsewhere. &gt;tangled mix of compromises That's a great way to put it. But dammit, it works! I'm sorry if I'm overselling it. &gt;So, to implement a VM-level preemptive scheduler, you would need to just writeback cached bytecode IP, etc., put current code object back on the scheduling queue, take a next code object from it, and feed it into VM loop again. Exemplary. Any idea how it's possible to take this multi core?

Still works in Jupyter. It basically turns the dataframe into a generator, so you can just iterate through it (in chunks).
MOTHER-FUCK!
Well then you can still turn to [dask](http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/why.html) or similar libraries :) 
I didn't know it made copies on Windows, as it creates links elsewhere. What's the advantage of making copies? I can only think of copying venvs around to different systems, which is generally a bad idea. Just copy the env definitions.

Install it to your machine, using the command line. 
Haha don't judge but I don't eat Laksa! Even though I'm Singaporean!
There is no install package. It is part of the source distribution of PyPy so you can get it the same way you can get the sources of PyPy by downloading a tarball or cloning the bitbucket repo
I used AutoML to train the model. It is a service provided by Google that automates machine learning by leveraging their neural network architecture. So all you need to do is to download the images from the Internet, which I used a scraping library to grab 100 images of each label, upload to Google Cloud and sync with the machine learning dataset :)
&gt; Erlang guys seem to solve this issue by this "Ports" thing. Yes, a walled garden. No direct interaction of user apps with an OS and all its big bustling world. &gt; I'm really sorry if I'm overselling it. I have a tendency to do that :/ But Erlang stuff is absolutely great! For niche usecases it was intended. It's a miracle that over 30 years of Erlang history, it grew enough body weight that 0.01% of projects use it outside the Ericsson ivory tower (which used to ban it as "proprietary" for a bit, if Wikipedia doesn't lie). Bottom line: It should be clear why a general-purpose language like Python couldn't grow such a scheduler natively. (See above - "walled garden", which is just too limiting.) &gt; Any idea how it's possible to take this multi core? Well, MicroPython supports (real OS-level) threads, so, multi-core shouldn't be a problem. They can communicate by whatever mechanisms needed (ehrm, supported by a bustling (or not so) OS). 
I searched &gt;swig.exe no such file and got: http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Windows.html 
Upadting requires tests and checks for production code, so just install the latest in your local test env but keep your default python aliased to the stable version, and specify exactly what you want for your new virtual environments. Dont break working code for no reason.
Makes sense. Thank you
Holy.. This is enlightening for me. Just found [this](https://blog.ironbay.co/reading-named-pipes-with-elixir-c5c614a32f25) article that was trying to do something on the lines of what you suggest cannot be done with Erlang xD. \&gt; Well, MicroPython supports (real OS-level) threads, so, multi-core shouldn't be a problem. uPy has no GIL? 
&gt; what you suggest cannot be done with Erlang xD. Well, I know too little of Erlang to suggest that something "cannot be done". Nor I suggest *that*, only that every case needs to be "vetted" to behave as expected, or patched to behave like that. (One article I read gave an example: "The Erlang regular expression library has been modified and instrumented even if it is written in C code. So when you have a long-running regular expression, you will be counted against it and preempted several times while it runs." I actually rejoiced reading that - I wanted to do that patching to sqlite for quite some time (a few years). Actually, makes me wonder if I still should want to patch it, or if it was already implemented.) &gt; uPy has no GIL? It's a configurable setting. If you know that you won't access same data structure at the same time (e.g., each thread has isolated environment, Erlang-style), or if you use fine-grained explicit locks, you can disable it. 
As far as I know, you need to run a cmd to pip install anything outside of spyder.
reporting and basic analysis is EDA...

Indeed. Most of the time when people use len-range, they either access just the items, or both index and items. In the rare case where you only need the index, I would still say `for i, _ in enumerate(items):` is cleaner 
For convenience in my case. I already had brew installed also.
Doing !pip in console works. Thanks for the reply, though.
&gt;So when you have a long-running regular expression, you will be counted against it and preempted several times while Well yes, that was the whole idea for ports. Each operation on it has a cost in reductions (their currency for counting). But then the gentleman ended the article saying that he couldn’t find an obvious, direct way of using pipes, so eventually had to flee towards Golang. Heck, even their official faq seems to suggest using an external program to do the work instead. http://erlang.org/faq/problems.html#idp32717328 — Anyway, one of the better arguments that I found for green processes is that they are very light compared to OS level ones. There are also internal mailboxes, or shared queues that erlang provides for communication, and since they don’t really use a network protocol, just plain copying — it sounds more efficient than OS pipes. Do you think this paradigm is worth exploring, just for these qualities?
&gt; But why did you decide to live with an intermediate release, even though you aren't a developer or a tester?.. If you go to python.org, it presents whatever the current latest version to you as the "default" download. I would imagine that for a ton of people that's the basis behind the version of Python they happen to initially install.
I’d definitely start with the basics of the language. Something like [Code Academy ](https://www.codecademy.com). I’m currently working through [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps) which is really well done but may not be a good resource for a complete beginner, but definitely once you’ve learned a bit about it. Good luck!
Well, you would have some sort of GPS device hooked up to the computer on which your Python code runs; and you would then use a library to talk to that receiver. But rather than give you the raw data streams from the GPS satellites (satellite ID + UTC time), the receiver unit would usually give you position data (latitude, longitude, elevation, precision). The triangulation required to go from the former to the latter happens on the GPS unit itself.
no worries. everyone has bad days. good on you for how you followed up. hope things are going well for you
Python seems to be following what is called [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). 3.6 will continue to receive bug updates for a while.
One small step for man, one huge step for Dave! Congrats Dave everyone has to start from somewhere!
Did the programm 'recognize' you or did it print your input?
Typing `ipdb.pm()` at the IPython prompt to invoke post-mortem debugging is the answer I was seeking.
Cool program and great write-up! A small note: where you say "scrap," I think should be "scrape" "scrap" refers to a little leftover chunk (noun) or to the act of dismantling an item to reuse it's components (verb) (because when we scrap we convert something into scrap material) "scrape" (as a verb) means harvesting the top layer of something and for when we talk about "web scraping" (funny, peeling off the top layer of The Internet) "scraping," as you use, is correct though, that corresponds to "scrape", while "scrapping" corresponds to "scrap"
You could replace the url with a short url or QRcode.
This is such a vague question, if you even want to call it a "question". Check out Rasa. Maybe that'll help.... but with the level of sophistication from this post, not sure much will help you. Gl. 
At first I downvoted your comment because in my mind there is a huge amount of complexity difference between a computer "recognizing" someone and just printing some input, But then I remembered how these early exercises go. First hello world: print("Hello, world!") Then with a variable: message = "Hello, world!" print(message) Then with input: name = input("what is your name?") message = "Hello, " + name + "!" print(message) And then with conditionals: name = input("what is your name?") if name == "Dave": message = "Hello, " + name + "!" else: message = "Go away " + name + "!" print(message) Thinking about it in that context, it's a somewhat valid question if oddly worded.
Sometimes you need to fail to learn. Take the kick in the arse and do better next time. 
&gt; There's a "fork FAQ" in README which gives high-level overview of things Pycopy is going to concentrate on: https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython#fork-faq (bottom). the first A doesn't really address the Q, IMO.
How quick the Anaconda distribution gets the Python updates?
until they run our of numbers ; 3.6.8,3.69 -&gt;3.7 ? 🤔
Is there a "thing"? I'm not sure what you're asking. It's more than a little ironic that not only do you seem incapable of doing your own work, you're even incapable of doing your own _scheming to get out of doing your own work_. Do whatever you want. I don't see you becoming a professional developer so getting a passing grade in your class probably won't have any effect on me or my colleagues.
3.27 is going to be a great version for Python.
3.6.10 is fine.
Now all you have to do is learn to take a screenshot ;-)

Python's exception handling should output "I'm sorry &lt;username&gt; I'm afraid I can't do that."
SyntaxError: You're trying to compile a f\*cking png file!!!
Looking at what OP produced, it's safe to say that he is still a beginner. An IDE would suite a beginner more than a text editor because it has more features out of the box (ex. Running code and compiling and so on). The worst thing you can do to a beginner is make them install esoteric (not that sublime completely falls under that case) software which might be hard to get a hang of. This might kill the beginner's motivation to actually learn to code. A part from that they will spend more time fumbling through the settings than actually making what they want.

ha - love it. nice reference.
Well that's the thing, installation occurs differently in Windows than in \*nix based systems. In \*nix anything can be an executable. The appropriate place is up to the user. It might be /bin. Or /sbin. Or the /usr variations. Or the /local variations. Or the /usr/local variations. Or /opt. Or some specific place in your `~`. Or whatever. On Windows that's not really the case. System wide programs go either in `\Program Files\` or the x86 suffixed directory. If it's user wide it goes in their local appdata (like chrome does) or their user folder or some subset. Because of the windows registry, it is not sufficient to link files together with soft or hard file links. Thankfully linux doesn't have this problem. This *may* cause problems. I highly doubt the problems will be common. And they will probably be super specific and using this super weird aspect of behavior. But it is always best, when changing behavior, to be overly clear what has changed (which isn't properly said), and to not make it a default change but an optional one. 
Nice start!
You made one of the most critical first steps, using PyCharm. An fully featured IDE such as the jetbrain's IntelliJ ones helps you passively learn. I've been writing Python for over 5 years, and IntelliJ *still* helps me passively learn and iterate faster. Keep up the good work!
I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.
Hmm... *clicks snipping tool* Done
Try AutoKeras too :)
Just checked it out and looks amazing! Probably will try it out for future projects!! :) 
The standard answer is "just use `functools.partial`", which works for the stdlib timeout too.

That's a way of using partial I never thought of... neat

what text editor are you using?
It reminds these moments I started learning Python. Young is so good. Life is short, I use Python.
Disclaimer. I am not an expert. I am (or was :) a mature student. Returned to school and just finished a degree in ComSci / minor Math. I've been looking at and taking online courses in Data Sci. I also worked as a TA many times. Now, after the boring (sorry about that) disclaimer. The first question, what do you really want to do? Tech is a pretty broad term. Do you want to build FinTech apps (by apps, I don't necessarily mean mobile) for example? Combining your background with Data Science might be an option. Again, for a responsible advice I'd have to know more about what you have in mind. As to programming, Python is a great language to start with. It is also one of the dominant languages in Data Science. I'd highly recommend taking the 2-sequence course (and buying the related book) from edx.org . Look for courses by MITx. The first is starting in January. One area you didn't mention but it might be worth some consideration is Data Visualization. This might be a good complement to your sales (presentation ?) and financial background. Sorry I can't be more precise. 
Is this AI?
Do you mean Import? The imported Script must not do anything, just supply the functions you want to Call. 
That's awesome, thank you for sharing! 
If I use import and call a function it will stop my current script. It should run without stopping my script.
When you do a function call, python has two ways of matching up the caller's provided arguments to those expected by the callee. The default is positional arguments - the caller doesn't specify the name of the arguments being passed explicitly. In this case, the arguments are matched up in order. The other is keyword arguments - the caller explicitly names which parameters are being passed, as in f(x=42). If you do a function call which uses types of arguments, then the positional arguments must come first, followed by the keyword arguments. So in your function call, you're passing probability and sigma as positional arguments, but mu as a keyword argument. I suspect that's a typo, and that you meant mu_0 instead of mu=0.
/r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; You may want to use a [sentinel value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value) in your loop: while True: temperature = get_temperature() if temperature == 99999: break;
Yes. Subprocess is the best way to do this. You could also make direct calls to the command line. The difference is that subprocess will start your script in an environment (ie. Environment variables) that you customize for that particular running instance. Also, the running instance is a subprocess of the calling instance in task manager. Additionally, the subprocess call can return a process handle. This is a reference to the subprocess itself, across which you can pass messages using pipes (ie. Stdout, stderr, etc). Subprocess is a very powerful way to run external processes. I use it a lot for application bootstrapping.
Perfect, thanks!
C++ was the wrong language to try and do what you were doing in the first place. It's like saying "I wanted to make a cake and I started by trying to grow some wheat and raise some chickens... It was so complicated. Then I switched to Duncan Hines and it was so much easier!" The whole point of high level languages is so you don't have to waste time raising chickens anymore. Python is easy to use, and there are a ton of cool libraries. But your task would have been much easier in almost any other language, like C# or even Javascript.
The easiest way to call the function asynchronously is using either Thread from the threading library or Process from the multiprocessing library. # create the object p = Process(target=func_name, args=(42, 'asdf')) # start the function running asynchronously p.start() ... # wait for the function to finish p.join()
This was great! How did you create the code walkthroughs? I found the comments and stepping through each line super useful, and I'd love to use it myself to keep track of concepts.
It's worth noting that subprocess.run and similar high-level facilities provided by subprocess will block the calling script until the called script finishes. In order to let the called script run asynchronously, you'll need to use subprocess.Popen There are some subtleties to I/O when using subprocess.Popen which are noted in the docs. I think if the code you're trying to run is in a function, threading.Thread and multiprocessing.Process will be simpler to work with
No kidding on my laptop I have to hit the {F10} key to take a screenshot. And on my desktop I have to hit {FN + F10}. The problem is if I hit {FN + F10} on my laptop it will put it in airplane mode. This has resulted in me disconnecting my laptop from the wifi multiple times.

Your `inverse_normal_cdf(...)` is probably going to give you trouble too. In one place you have it called with `tolerance`, which is neither defined nor used anywhere.
Thanks! This was actually pretty tricky and time-consuming, and I wish it was easier to make them - but I am happy to hear you enjoyed them and found them useful. The way it works is this. Every python method is reimplemented in JS. The reimplementation takes snapshots at certain points. The comments are dynamic are generated based on the state of the function at any given point. 
That would be fun to make but totally useless
I didn't start using PyCharm, now I just can't get into it. Feels like it over complicates everything. I do sometimes paste code in there if I'm struggling to debug something as it is good at pointing out errors.
If you have a function that grabs the value, it'll re-evaluate it each time you call it. So if you call it in the loop, it'll get a fresh value each time.
Thank you. I did mean mu_0 and that did fix my error. I didn't even notice that after looking it at so long.
Thank you, that's what I'll do.
Thank you!
What's with the sarcasm and the toxicity? Is this what this sub really has become? 
I don't get how such a post can have 300+ upvotes. Let's be honest here, it's not an achievement, there are billion tutorials on how to write "hello world". I'm glad OP is getting started with Python but this is low quality post for a Python sub
I ended up noticing that after I posted this and changed it to: def inverse_normal_cdf( probability, mu=0, sigma=1, tolerance=0.00001 ): if mu !=0 or sigma != 1: return mu + sigma * inverse_normal_cdf(probability, tolerance=tolerance) 
Or, you know, it could have looked at the username for the account executing it.

Is it just me or does the reflection look like a bird with a glowing eye?
Great start. Keep it going. Just build on what you have already done!!
Congratulations! Btw, be careful how you store your code. Put it in folders you can find easily (Documents, maybe), and add a date and a small description to the top of each file or project. Later you'll want to look at your old code.
The inspector is one of the greatest parts about PyCharm. The default configuration is very useful. What do you think PyCharm overcomplicates things? I've tried to get the same or "good enough" experience in vim or atom, and I just haven't been able to. I'll write some smaller scripts in vim out of habit, but when shit hits the fan like you're saying, PyCharm helps me fill in the gaps quickly and efficiently.
Unless something important is included in the omitted code, it's possible that self.p is undefined if the activate method was never called. It's also possible that there is a weird interaction between the QMainWindow class and the atexit library. Rather than terminating the subprocess via atexit, it may be better to override QWidget's closeEvent callback.
I can make a computer say 'hello world' in 42 different languages! &amp;#x200B; But can you make them do anything?
Even the longest journey begins with a single step.

You're trying to cheat the system to avoid cheating. Even if it's less academically dishonest, you're still trying to get a grade that you don't deserve. Work your butt off to understand it and accept the grade you get, but don't give up
Request expects the headers in dictionary form, but your headers object is a set containing just the one string. Instead, you should do headers = { 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 ...' }
Your headers are a set. When you put items in curly braces with no colons to separate keys and vales it's a set. headers = { 'a', 'b'} #set headers = ['a', 'b'] #list headers = { 'a':'foo', 'b':'foo'} #dict
Way to go Dave!
Finally, learn about how using `+` to concatenate strings is awful in basically every language that supports it and that using `#format` or `f`-strings makes more sense.
Would you happen to have an example of a molecular dynamics project? I’m a bioengineering major so that kind of application is one of the major reasons I’m trying to learn Python.

Hey, who's that guy up there with Dave?
Install Greenshot, Screenpresso, or one of countless other screenshot tools. 
Of course you avoid map since clearly you don't know how to use it. To get the most performance in cpython you must have as little work done in the eval loop as possible. In that regard you're correct, however it needs to be said that function objects are actually rather cheap since all the components used to make it including its `__code__` are cached within the `co_consts` field of the code object it is created in, so all that needs to be done is the malloc and few pointer assignments. Anyway, used correctly map would be anywhere from 20-1000% more more faster than your list comp, you just need to memorize the tools needed to do so. Specifically in this instance without knowing anything about `x`, use operator.methodcaller. `[*map(methodcaller("abc"), lista)]` will be so much faster. And there's usually an even more efficient way if you don't need to be generic. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I think the shorter and almost always at least a little faster code thanks to map is very beautiful. I will say that of course map plus list unpacking can be slower if no builtin function calls are made but that shouldn't ever actually be the case.

I think that simply finding SWIG will not solve your problem. SWIG is needed to generate C code that glues together Python interpreter and some other library that implements its API in a way compatible with C. Once you have SWIG you will need MSVC (the compiler that typically comes with Microsoft Visual Studio). Since that's not a free product, you will have to figure out some way of installing it in pieces (the pieces of it that you need are available without charge, but finding and installing them is not exactly what MS would like you to do, so it's hard). You will also need the version matching your Python interpreter: different versions of Python compile with different versions of MSVC (also pay attention to whether either one of those is designed for 32-bit or 64-bit architectures). Bottom line: if the above sounds not like something you would want to spend your time on, use Anaconda and its package manager instead of `pip`. Probably `conda forge` will know how to install your library. Second best option: use Linux, setting up your compiler to match your package requirement is much easier there. Or search the interent for a binary wheel for your package (maybe someone already went through the pain of configuring their Windows environment to work with Python and actually compiled this package). The downside of this is these wheels are rarely up-to-date, you will have hard time distributing your projects and related problems.
- hello Dave *leaves room*
I don't know how `brew` works, but `pip` is a very sloppy package manager. It is very easy to run your Python setup into complete mess using `pip`. The way `pip` installs things is by first putting them into your system *and then* making sure the dependencies can also be installed. If the *and then* part fails, you end up with the broken system. So, I'd say that if you are installing something for use as a user (for example, you just want to run some scripts that come with the package you want), then use `brew`, if you are a programmer, who wants to use the installed package in their library, then use `setuptools` (create `setup.py` and so on). `pip` is kind of trying to take the place of `setuptools` for library development but in over a decade it wasn't able to come up with a coherent solution to that end, and now it seems like `setuptools` project is once again receiving some attention... so, I'd go with that, if possible.

 modules would have to be reloaded in newly spawned threads, right?
If you are on Linux, then drives (block devices) are represented by (pseudo-) files in (pseudo-) file system, in many cases `/dev/` (`udev` would normally put some links there). You can certainly open one of those and write to it as if it was a regular file. Most likely this doesn't transfer to other systems, so, I don't know if you can do this on Windows or even on Mac (even though it should be similar to Linux).
Accessed the webcam, used principle component analysis to determine if a face is in the frame, captured it and then fed it into a deep learning neural network trained on 6 million Facebook profiles to match the face to a name. Sounds complicated, but in python it's only like 9 lines of code.

&gt;This may cause problems. I highly doubt the problems will be common. And they will probably be super specific and using this super weird aspect of behavior. Giving a precise example would be tricky. For one thing, this can cause issues on virtual environments linked across network drives in windows, for sure. Because whereas a copy would get any registry entries and relatively created files be backed uniquely on the copy-- now you'd get registry entries made around the linked-to version. And relatively created files-- that depends on how the link is made and the properties of the link. It could be made relative to the link, it could be made relative to the source, or it could be made relative to the source as if it was pretend-located on the client windows machine. Now I don't know how common that is, but I'm sure at least one person has done it. There are a potential slew of other problematic situations I'm sure-- however I don't have enough experience with windows to predict what those may be. Just enough to know that links and copies do not behave exactly the same way, and anything that was banking on the behavior of a copy would now be screwed. They don't even behave "close enough". Again, on \*nix it isn't a problem because anything and it's mother is a program and the amount of decisions the OS makes in regard to software and how it acts and what it does is minimal. Oh and the linking semantics are extremely well documented and behave more or less either like a copy or like a link to source, and the user can explicitly decide to use the opposite semantics if wanted easily (and can't in Windows).
I use Qt widgets and am happy with them. I have no experience with qml.
Add *.title* to the end of the variable that dave is stored in and bam the first letter will be capitalized.
What kind of registry entries are you talking about. AFAIK a venv doesn't do any registry entries. 
Great project! Don't forget to put location/date infos in each picture filename so you can give context when posting the picture ;)
Or simply: ``` exec(open("./filename").read()) ```
Dang. I've been using my "prntscrn" button like a moron.

&gt; Do you think this paradigm is worth exploring, just for these qualities? Selfish guy in me just wants to shout "If you have a great idea - go for it!" and call it Merry Christmas ;-). More reasonable part of me calls to consider "Why" and "What happens next". Do you write an MS thesis? Pleasy-please do it, and using MicroPython! Do you love Erlang paradigm, but absolutely hate the language, i.e. have own itch to scratch? Go for it! But otherwise, you need to consider what needs to be done. I'd formulate that Erlang has cooperative concurrency, but done and gone so pervasive that it works (almost) like preemptive, up to being PRed as such. So, you would need to do just the same as e.g. I'm doing (or set to do) with uasyncio, but go much farther and deeper than I. And what happens then, after years of hard work on your part? You'll find that of a few people who really *need* that paradigm, most will prefer to use Erlang still. So, consider your choices, find or dismiss compromises, bear the weight of decisions - all the usual life stuff ;-). 
Isn't this exactly `pip3 install`? Because I see that `python3 -m pip` will call the pip3 executable.
&gt; modules would have to be reloaded in newly spawned threads, right? Well, if you want completely isolated *processes*, then yeah, processes in common sense include their initialization from grounds up, right? Can optimize that if you want, but of course, that would require immutable namespaces. Funnily, Python has support to make that "transparent". I mean, that "global" vs "builtins" namespace dichotomy seems word. Fairly speaking, I don't know any other language which has such split, and it requires extra pointer =&gt; bloat. But it well covers the case we describe. Globals are well, module's globals. But builtins are effectively system-wide globals. You can put stuff there, and it automatically available to any function per Python semantics. The only remaining piece is making a namespace immutable. In that regard, do you know a Python idiom (or trick) to wrap module's globals() with a proxy object? (To clarify, I ask that and exactly that. Yeah, I understand that one can proxy module object as stored in sys.modules). 
This is utopia
Next step, hash tables in c.

This is considering if you have the actual `module` object in hand? Correct me if I am wrong, but are you suggesting wrapping the namespace so that it’s parallelism safe? 
I feel like it has passed the Turning test. You have created an AI. Congratulations. 
Next step metaprogramming in C++. 
Next step, Photoshop in pure Binary. 
how was it caused?
Rather doubt it. import sys;sys.setrecursionlimit(1&lt;&lt;30);f=lambda f:f(f);f(f)
&gt; Correct me if I am wrong, but are you suggesting wrapping the namespace so that it’s parallelism safe? Well, to achieve the isolation. You don't want one process to redefine what len() means for all other processes, do you? (Where "process" is just a function running in a thread). But in general, for whatever reason. Current me is not interested in parallelism, isolation, etc. But me always interested in curing Python's curse, which is overdynamicity. What it to be (able to be) more static, e.g. to shift various boring lookups from runtime to compile time. Of course, that's valid only if no runtime redefinitions happen. Need a way to tell if a particular app is well-behaving, and aids to develop well-behaving apps. ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; import mod1_immu &gt;&gt;&gt; mod1_immu &lt;roproxy &lt;module 'mod1_immu' from 'mod1_immu.py'&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mod1_immu.foo 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; mod1_immu.foo=1 Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; AttributeError: 'roproxy' object has no attribute 'foo' ``` The latter error is current MicroPython-speak for "attribute is not writable" ;-). 
roproxy is a generalization of CPython's MappingProxyType. Oh, and of course, for real life, we need to disable overriding functions and classes. Storing to global vars is useful. But functional junkies among us can already appreciate that generic roproxy thing ;-). 
Wait, that isn’t just immutable, it’s static!
Damn that movie would have been a lot shorter if the crew just had superuser rights.
Plz don't do this with production or interested code
What type is your data? Unicode? Ascii? Add a try except block to the part that is errorring and print the offending line. Else, use a debugger and add break points to figure out what's happening. It's likely the data has an accent Mark or something that is causing a decide error. Just a guess though
That’s why I switch to Mac, where screenshot is so much simpler.

Hello Daaaaaaaaaaave.
I like Pickpick. Good for drawing things on to send to people who don't computer very well as instructions or for how-to guides.
Hear hear. /r/MachineLearning had similar problems and they solved it by setting a restriction on the type of posts: only self post were allowed. If you wanted to share a link, you’d have to create a self post and add text to it explaining the resource. It helped immensely.

&gt; I tried to manipulate a JSON file using c++... My condolences.
Hold my compiler...
oo mistyped that 0 to a 1. wonder what'll happen 
That's a lot more common than you think... especially if you are using native extensions.
When I tried it I followed the exercises in a book called 'Basic Concepts in Computational Physics' by Benjamin Stickler. The main idea is to study a system of a particles described by a Lennard Jones potential. It is a pretty decent starting point for learning about MD and you can try to replace the potential for something more realistic later on. 
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable
Run your script like this: python -m pdb your_script.py Once it shows you the prompt `(pdb)` type: b /usr/local/lib/python3.7/xmlrpc/client.py:439 And this will launch you on an exciting journey exploring the intricacies of XML format. You might also want to send Christmas greetings to the nice people who wrote `xmlrpc` library and thank them for printing the text they weren't able to parse.
I am not a native speaker and not a python expert but thanks for answering 
a = str(input("What is your name?")); &amp;#x200B; print(f"Hello, {a}");
Clever...clever...
Don't be obtuse. Just because JSON is in a javascript format does not mean people just automatically understand how to read data from JSON and do stuff with it. This guy is obviously a beginner.

Nice reference ;). Welcome to Python!
I would use it for reconnaissance. For example if you know someones username, and want to find where else they use that username, they could use this tool. &amp;#x200B; Merry Christmas! (If you celebrate it) :)
As soon as I move our org to 3!
Multithreading works perfectly well. The one thing it doesn't let you do is to use multiple cores for computation-intensive actions, and yes, that's a lack, but a majority of the time I'm using threads in any language, it's because I need to do I/O in parallel to computations, and that works very nicely. If you need more than one computation thread, then no, you can't really do that with Python threading. You end up using multiprocessing for that, and I won't pretend that this isn't extra work, but only a fairly minority of the programs you end up writing have this issue in practice. 
Why are you converting a string to a float?
When it’s a string it can’t calculate fractional numbers

Not much of an achievement, everybody knows Dave. /s

Next famous step: make a calculator! Then the next challenge is figuring out how to navigate stack overflow. That's the real challenge right there.
Yay. Who cares? Python should follow the rules for /r/cpp and ban posts like this.
What a spirit, thank you 
[Hello Dave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGW4LrdC5Zw)
Try capitalizing the entry 
my comment was directed at you making it sound like json was exceedingly difficult in javascript
Every thousand mile journey begins with a single step. 
I personally think that everything that doesn't conform (to the majority of) PEP008 on the internet is a pain in the ass. If everything is formatted the same way, it is way easier to find your way through a larger codebase.
I never want to look at my old code, to be honest. But then again, it is mostly unmaintainable stuff I have to look at at some point, because it breaks.
I've had a segfault issue with pgmagick once, which I was using under multiprocessing. MP didn't properly handle segfault exit codes of its own processes, so it just hanged waiting for the process to return, it was really fun debugging it... 
While it may be not much of an achievement and a somewhat low quality post, I still enjoy it. That's why it got my upvote too.
Install pocketsphinx directly using the wheel
Tried on windows 10 and there are lots of issues about user interface like character sequence on each line, right panel buttons, terminal. But I liked theme. You should use it on Windows to see what I saw. And a requirements.txt would be nice to have. Seems good work anyway.
You have build AI please dont destroy the world
I think the feeling's at the right place! :) But I wouldn't like to see ten posts like this a day and the amount of upvotes show that it could be encouraged. (Merry Christmas :))
If you're into genealogy /r/gramps is always looking for contributors :) PS: I'm a user of the program only. 
I get the criticism, and have to admit that I haven't thought that far. But than again, I think that if there were too many of those posts, they wouldn't get that many upvotes precisely because there are more. Also: a merry Christmas to you too! 
My first programming language was C, and I remember feeling awesome with my hello world program :D `#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; main() { printf("Hello World"); }`
What happened to the "prtscr" key?
Good job and good luck on your learning journey. 
I’m afraid I can’t do that Dave.
That will be the release after 3.9
No, Python is not semantic versioned. There are several cases of features going through depreciation and removal over a series of dot releases (What would be a minor release, was it in fact semver)
Taking 300 level classes and can’t make a proper screenshot \*smdh\*
Cool, I didn't know such a thing existed. I've always used a basic terminal app and installed all of the tools separately. I haven't done it on this phone because it's a long process, but this termux sounds pretty easy. Thanks.
Are you familiar with https://beta.observablehq.com/ ? It's a general tool for doing updating Javascript notebooks.
Thank you! 
I'm currently working on eating as much as possible without getting a stomach pain!! As well I'm actually also making a backend for my temperature smart home project, of course using Python!
Taking a break for a couple of weeks from my current project -- a programming language implemented in Python with LLVM by way of the `llvmlite` library. [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) I'll be back to work on it in January, but you can always pull and try out the examples (sorry, Win32 only for now). I try to keep `master` in such a state that the examples and the tests should work at any given time.
Good luck with your stomach pain!
Good point about esp (hey, another project for my someday list!), but regardless Stackless puts a lot of Erlang-ish stuff into a Python frame. It seems like a lot of people are not aware of it. 
its very slow.. requests could be done asynchronously
It's a cool project but I'm having trouble thinking of a way to use it that isn't creepy. Merry Christmas!
Use it for your old internet accounts. Find them and delete the ones you no longer use. Or stock someone online. 
As the other presenter said: Business intelligence can be a great way for someone with a lot of industry knowledge to break into technical side. In the financial industry, Tableau is king. Knowing how to get data for tableau to consume could set you above the average BI analyst. Learning relational database principles, Python or R for data processing and data visualization principles would all be great steps.
He was saying JSON is easy in high level languages like javascript and C#

That's an amazing project you are planning to do! I wish you all the best! :)
Which is precisely why I don't use the same username across sites.
You can also use it if you're thinking about brand names, to see what's available still...
stalk
On your self.showtask.create_text function call, specify a fixed-width font, such as Courier.
Good idea. I'm thinking if there is a way where you can manipulate the EXIF data of a scanned fine and attach the right date or year to the picture.
I never thought about that, that's actually a pretty cool idea! 
Do you have an alternative? 
I've seen it and played a little bit. I think it is more suited for more "typical" data visualizations, rather than visualizations of algorithms. I think Observable is really cool though! I have a couple of small visualizations that I'd like to make, and Observable would be perfect for them.
I would recommend using virtual environments for this. I do not want to install your programs dependencies globally on my computer, and that is your recommended way to install this.
Mate why would you use their real name
Wow ! Thank you, it was a quite simple problem in the end. 
How would you do this? I know how to make environments for development but not for deployment. 
Im writing functions for fast distance calculation for the Python API for starcraft bots. I would be happy if you critique my Code :) https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/210306/fast-distance-calculation-for-starcraft2-bot
Thanks. Seems pretty useful for hunting down old unused accounts. Though it seems to match a couple of sites that use JS to render the site even when the user page is 404.
Next step I would think about boundary conditions, for example, what happens if the user divides by zero? What if they don't input a number? 
Could be ESL
Well, you could in your instructions just say as so: $ python3 -m venv sherlock_env $ source sherlock_env/bin/activate (sherlock_env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt (sherlock_env) $ python3 sherlock.py This is what I did. For packaging and distribution you would probably want to look at one of the popular solutions for that. You could also use something like `pipenv` or another, better, manager for that.
Should *
Use virtualenv! https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/#usage sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenv sherlock_env # run install steps from GitHub repo 
You should learn how to use punctuation and case properly before you hate on someone else's grammar.
Congrats!!!! Next step is to include loops and error checking my dude!!!
For deployment, users should have their own setup (unfortunately Python doesn't provide something like it). You can use PyInstaller to create a self-contained executable, it worked very well last time I tried it.
Advent of Code bru! Adventofcode.com is a series of coding challenges that follow the christimas advent. They are all very fun an exciting! I am doing all of them in Python this year, but you can use any language you want!
From a security perspective, which is what it sounds like he made this for, it can be used by red teams to enumerate usernames and possibly find compromised credentials. From a blue team perspective you could use it to find out more about a particular username if you find someone signed their malware etc. 
Maybe there should be a rule that this cant be posted to reddit
Why do you think so?
Never thought about that, pretty interesting
I think that should be a law enforcement only capability ideally. Idk its just my personal nostalgia for when the internet seemed pretty anonymous. How can a program like this be used for good?
You're right, multi-threading "works", if you accept the the definition of multi-threading as running multiple threads one thread at a time. And yes, you could argue that most people don't actually need parallelism but will be fine with concurrency most of the time... but at this point that's like saying that most of the time, drivers don't need seat belts and airbags, because most of the time spent in a car is not spent crashing. Which brings me back to the main point: if you actually need *actual* multi-threading, you're better off using another language. 
You can do this just by googling the username...lol
What you need to do is go to office hours or talk to fellow students. Cheating does not allow you to learn. If you don't have time, either make time or drop the class.
i didn't
Obviously the next step is to write a neural network to predict user input 
pep8
Does adding a [GUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Chatterbot.py) onto the front-end of a Chatbot so that it looks like an instant message interface count as updated? Or how about a [text to speech version](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Chatterbot_With_TTS.py) for the fun of it? &amp;#x200B;
To be fair his, deps are json, os, and requests. I don't know about you but those are like bread and butter for me. If I don't have them on hand there better be a compelling reason why. Not telling you that you shouldn't use venvs, just wanted to point this out
Go look at OP's code, its not really doing anything besides checking is a username exists at a site. Thats the only link, it could even be a different person / user who just got that user name first. &amp;#x200B; There is nothing to stop me from going to facebook, instagram, twitter, etc and just typing in your user name "Stone\_d\_" and doing exactly what this script does. This just makes it slightly faster. Its not like it knows "Stone\_d\_" is "gold\_man" on twitter, and "joe\_schmoe" on google +. Its just a simple script that hits urls...
Yeah man only law enforcement should have this much [power](https://i.imgur.com/4e3as0t.png)
