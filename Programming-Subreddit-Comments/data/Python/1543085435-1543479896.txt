I've always been afraid of a Python GUIs mainly becase I've only ever only tried to use Qt, Kivy, and Tkinter. I will check this out though! If you are in the python discord hit me up macs#6326
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
&gt;I've always been afraid of a Python GUIs &amp;#x200B; One of the reasons PySimpleGUI was created was to help out people that had tried working with one of the Python GUI frameworks but was ultimately not successful, perhaps through no fault of their own. These interfaces are not trivial to learn. They can be presented in highly object-oriented manner on top of things which makes it difficult for some people to follow. Just because you know how classes work doesn't mean you find it easy to program with them. PSG doesn't force you into a class model. It's quite procedural in terms of the overall interface. If you've tried one of those in the list, you'll love PySimpleGUI. Not on discord. I'll sign up. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I started programming with Obj C so GUIs to me are totally different in my mind. However I do really want to look at PySimpleGUI and if you could help that would be much appreciated. 
Trying out PyMacro3 which actually runs, OhMyZsh which is very cute and VS Code Code Runner - (hasn't gotten me to stop using Eclipse PyDev at least not yet), and reading from Uncle Steve's [Bedtime Algorithm Stories](http://www.algorist.com/).

I am really sorry that you had to go through this. It is one thing to guide someone away from a clearly innocent mistake, towards licensing norms and another get involved in aggressive remarks. Licensing rules are not to create a police state, but simply to protect the creator's rights. Since the creator (Mirumee) did not complain and is obviously glad that they received unintentional promotion, it is unfair of others to accuse you. Reddit can be an ass at times.
I see, didn't see that comment the first time I was here. Sorry for argumenting 
I am looking into maze generation using tree and graph algorithms as part of term project. Did randomized dfs and binary tree till now. https://i.imgur.com/6FkAbZd.png
There are most definitely ways of *coercing* someone to reveal a password through the use of force. But that's a subtly different thing. This distinction is the basis of US law where it's legal for police to force you to unlock your devices with biometrics but illegal to force you to unlock with a password.
You've asked if we have a bigger resolution of the \*original\* graphic design (that was an illustration we've created for Python position at our company). And we said that we don't have it. You've never mentioned a word that you want to use it as a wallpaper or especially that you want to redistribute the modified version here. You've never asked for permission to modify our work and publish it here. Instead, you've chosen to modify it yourself and post it on Reddit with no mention of the original author. I'm surprised that you don't understand the difference here (or you're pretending you don't) and I'm even more surprised that you keep defending it. Please, don't blame others for pointing this out - the very minimum was mentioning the author (you knew the original author so this was your choice to omit this).
Everyone, and I do mean, EVERYONE was new at the beginning of their journey into programming in &lt;InsertLanguageHere&gt; Apply for all the jobs you can find and be honest on your applications your fill out. Your likely job title would probably be a Jr programmer. Don't embellish because at some point you will be called on it and you probably wouldn't be able to do it. The biggest problem with new skills is that you need experience to get the job, but without a job, it seems you will never get the experience. Be patient.
The Error is there because you try Random with [], this implies selecting the element "0.85,1" from it, you want () because you `call` it with these two values. Apart from that is Random a class so you may need Something else or a Method of Random or something
That doesn't show anything about them saying you can redistribute it.
Sorry didn’t know you wanted to compete in the wallpaper market. Don’t worry I deleted the post. Enjoy your free publicity. 
Welcome to python! Although we love beginners, this sub isn’t really for this type of thing. Try r/learnpython
read our sidebar r/learnpython 
No problem, I’ll try that!
Although here’s a hint, look into threading or asyncio. 
Ik I love these. I’m not very good though ... :)
No problem. Let us know how you get on. random has various functions, I think uniform is what you need. Might be worth looking up what options there are though. 
I don't have a specific goal. I'd rather some general tips, something that could help with a good range of ideas.
I'm not referring to the typing part. I'm referring to the part that you have to import all the types that you're going to use. By importing typing, you're importing one small module. If you write a function that can take a list, tuple and a numpy array, but you don't use any numpy imports, you just added an import despite not necessarily needing it. Probably doesn't matter too much for numpy, but given a bigger module, that starts to matter.
If you can compile it, isn't it just code? Nice project :).
The value inside the \[ \] had no use on the formula, idk why they showed the formula with it. Now it all made since for me, to use Random as a variable. damage\_1= (2\*Level+10)/250 damage\_2= Attack/Defense damage\_3= damage\_1 \* damage\_2 \* Base + 2 modifier\_1 = STAB \* Type \* Critical \* Other modifier = modifier\_1 \* Random damage = damage\_3 \* modifier print(damage)
Usually I would comment "whatever", but since this thread really has me TO'ed I'm going to dismantle all of your incoherent arguments: 1. If your argument is that I should not have made the reddit post at all: You don't need permission under fair use, which is defined by substantial transformation, lack of commercial intent, and lack of competition with the original work. All three of these are satisfied. You aren't in the market of making that advert into a wallpaper that I'm competing with for commercial purposes. (By the way, *you're welcome* for my drawing attention to basic copyright issues. You guys are a company so I would have thought you would have some basic insight into these things. I did this all without charging a consulting fee.) 2. Your argument about me asking if the "*original*" had a higher res but not specifying that "higher resolution" could also mean "higher resolution and less cropped" is total bullshit and I think you know that. You have to know that. Obviously if someone asks for a higher resolution of an image that can include one that contains the higher resolution image within it. So that's just filibustering with stupid arguments. 3. Your argument that there was 'no mention' of the original author: Again patently false considering that attribution was given in subsequent posts and I never claimed an original work in the title. Anyway I deleted the post because I didn't care to give you any free publicity on account of your personal attacks to satisfy your need to feel morally superior. 
import ShellCommand and define new function shell_call, the one written in the package you use does not let you parametrize the Popen used deep inside properly: from shell_command import ShellCommand def shell_call(command, *args, **kwds): return ShellCommand(command, **kwds).shell_call(*args) fixed that, use as follows: def Hostname(): with open('hostname-output.txt', 'w+t') as output: shell_call("hostname", stdout=output, stderr=output) this will redirect both output streams of your command, standard output and standard error, the the file given as the first parameter to open function.
Seems like you'd want to use something like [subprocess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4760215/running-shell-command-and-capturing-the-output)? Then obviously keep writing the outputs to a text file on your desktop with append mode open("output.txt", "a"), making sure to add a newline *\n* if they aren't present (they should be though).

It looks like random is supposed to be a random number between 0.85 and 1. If you keep your variable Random as 1, your damage will be off. I'd suggest trying this: import random as r rand_num = r.uniform(0.85, 1) And then the rest of your code. 
Read our sidebar Don't post images of code, post the code itself Visit r/learnpython
No, but /r/learnpython can. They'll be more able to help if you share your code as text rather than an image. But this might help: ```python list_of_numbers = [2, 3, 4] product = 1 for n in list_of_numbers: product *= n ```

I think you might want to try to read the whole thread again when you calm down. The only one attacking here seems to be you, even with that post above. You don't seem to get that people might not like how you shared this modified design publicly without asking or consent. The way you defend it speaks for itself. We share a lot with the community almost everyday so we would be really easy and understanding but arguing that "you found something on internet" and that "there was no watermark" and that "this is for the community" :)), well, think about it. I hope this is not your only or preferred way of "creating" - but this is your problem. Also, please enjoy the free publicity you received thanks to our illustration. Way to go.

You can just print a picture of an employer and hold it in front of your face. This is why 'real' face detection is expensive: They have 3D and IR cameras to prevent the most basic hacks. Thinking that you can code this stuff yourself and make it secure, is dangerously naive. 
It can give the appearance of gate-keeping. You cant stop people coming here to ask questions, because as you say, this is a hub. OP needs to stop trying to control, and learn to accommodate.
I'm considering Python for 2018 too. Or going bi-/trilingual, Python included.

Hold up how?
So I’m confused on how to have the x axis display every number from 4 to 21 and have the bars on top of them. And also and the y axis I want to change it to probability so I want the values to range from .0 to .15 or so
You should look into the xticks method and in your line where you actually create the plot you can set the density argument to True

seaborn countplot, I think?
What type of minigame do you want to do?
I'm at least thinking one of them being similar to candy crush, huniepop, etc, another a sort of cooking-based game, stuff like that.
You'd have to try it, but since PyCharm likely uses sys.excepthook and I'm just rewriting sys.stderr I think so
What's this about? Do you have a question or sth? the x axis from 4 to 22 looks fine to me, since the minimum value is 4 (two 2's) and the maximum is 21. You need to normalize the y-axis though as this is currently a count of some sort, not a probability.

No, in any [Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_\(mathematics\)) dividing by 0 is undefined, whether that Field is over R or C. I think what your thinking of is the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere) which is an extension of the Complex Numbers, but also has a [Real analogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line) so isn't just limited to the complex plane.

OOP is a game changer when adding to the basics of scripting.
I've never actually used it, but from the documentation, [Creator-Defined Displayables](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/udd.html) might be what you want.
&gt; P.S If anyone sees a way to improve the code/a better way to do it let me know, I love making my code more efficient. How about making it more understandable? I can't make heads or tails of it. You use generic, meaningless names like `getThing` and global state which you modify while iterating over it. Yuck. What is the code supposed to do? What's "a stream of ordered output from 2 generators"? Do you mean interleaving the output? def interleave(a, b): for x, y in zip(a, b): yield x yield y list(interleave("abcd", "efgh")) Gives output `['a', 'e', 'b', 'f', 'c', 'g', 'd', 'h']`. To join into a single string, use `''.join()`. A random thought... You have generator comprehensions like `(i for i in itemList)` in a couple of places. Never do that. That's total n00b code, and basically screams "I don't know what I'm doing!", like writing a function that just calls another function and doesn't nothing else: def length(obj): # Just like calling len, but slower. return len(obj) You wouldn't do that, I trust. 99% of the time, you can just iterate over `itemList` instead. The few times you need more, use the `iter()` builtin. 
Depends on how you define "absolute basics". Some really useful things to know whether they fall under that umbrella or not: * [All the builtins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and how to use them * How to use [special methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) * [String formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) * [List](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) and [Dict](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) comprehension expressions * The Dict section briefly describes an example of dictionary comprehension, it works very similarly to list comprehension so it doesn't merit its own section. * Argument and variable unpacking ``` # unpack a list into a function accepting an arbitrary number of arguments a = [1, 2, 3] some_function(*a) # same as some_function(1, 2, 3) # unpack a Dict into a function accepting arbitrary keyword arguments kwa = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} some_function(**kwa) # same as some_function(a=1, b=2, c=3) # unpack a list of two items into two variables item_0, item_1 = [1, 2] item_0 # value is 1 item_1 # value is 2 ``` * Using and defining decorators (can't find official doc page for decorators, if anyone has it handy or a good tutorial page in mind, definitely share) * [Context managers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers) * [Metaclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=decorators#metaclasses) * Multiple inheritance [method resolution order](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/)

A library I wrote to handle a lot of the data processing I need for machine learning and other tasks.
Oh man, can't wait to try this. When I saw the title, my first thought was "Why not use Dask"? Quite helpfully, the first page of the README had the question "Why not Dask for data processing?". My man!
Yes a few of my colleagues expected it to be all CLI. The purpose overall is to enable non-coders to be able to build scripts and run tests easily with almost zero automation knowledge. So that may play a part in why this is GUI based. This module is actually part of a larger GUI I'm working on that takes a user from start to finish with three simple buttons / sections. Configuring settings, building the scripts, testing them and generating report including graphs and screenshots. All in a simple GUI with giant buttons. Thanks for your interest!
Yyyeeeaaahhh I'm not really comfortable with the "educational" direction this is going.

Since it sounds like you know a bit about dask, is it impossible to add this type of functionality to dask? Does dampr require things that dasks model isn't meant to do? For reference, I use a lot of dask arrays for satellite imagery processing and haven't done much with DataFrames or Bags.

Usage of "or" is wrong
Github triple-backtick code blocks aren't supported by reddit. Instead prepend 4 spaces to each line in the code block. The latter half of your list is also messed up, you probably need an additional newline to trigger list formatting (so the list looks like it is beginning a new paragraph). That happens to me a lot.

Yes I know, but in the case of the // (integer division), why not just always set it to return an integer type since it will always output a whole number anyway?

Thanks for this. Helpful to see what other packages are offering.
The Python [data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html). &gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. &gt; Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. &gt; -- The Zen of Python What underlies this one and obvious way to do it is the Python data model. As usual, some else already introduces it more succinctly than I: &gt; You can think of the model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interface of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, iterators, functions, classes, context managers, and so on. - Luciano Ramalho, Fluent Python Most Python programmers know that, in Python, everything is an object. Each possessing an identity, type, and value. The Python data model allows developers to emulate basic types (sequences, iterators, context manager, etc...) using Python's [specialmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) to use Python constructs and data structures with clean, readable idioms. In short, the **Python data model allows developers to write Pythonic Python**. Code not using the model tends to "smell" wrong - it may look overly verbose, cumbersome or convoluted.
Have looked at the [WordCloud](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/index.html) package? There is a tutorial on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python) &amp;#x200B;
I’ll check this out when I start my new job in Jan. 
Python fanboys cannot believe their favorite language is so dumb :) There are even more retarded things going on in Python arithmetic. For instance, in Python, you can compute congruence of a rational number modulo another rational number. I.e. 7.0 % 3.0 = 1.0. Because, obviously, you cannot divide 1.0 by 3.0... I mean, how can a modulo produce a rational number is beyond anyone's comprehension, but being coherent isn't what bothers Python developers. Normal person would expect that computing congruence of rational numbers would result in an error, or, at least, the smallest possible value. Neither behavior is particularly useful (just a waste of space to implement), so the developers decided: "screw this math thing, we don't know anything about anyways", let's make it do something! hu-ha!" But, the same sense of expedience abandoned them when they decided to implement integer division for floats. It's not really defined what should happen if you divide a rational number by an integer. But, there are two obvious "useful" ways this can go: 1. There's an intuitive way of how one can make an integer into a rational, and then do rational division. That's a mathy kind of way, but this doesn't do integer division, it's just normal division. 2. There's an intuitive way of how one can make a rational into an integer, and do integer division--well, that's more like what integer division is supposed to look like. And that's, actually, what this operator does... apart from converting the result to rational again. What for? Why? Nobody knows...
I'll be downvoted, but I download source and build it myself for various reasons.
Agreed. OTOH, it seems like there could be some surprise that an *operator* (rather than a function) would be immune to the contagiousness. I mean, 4.0/2.0 also has an integer answer but returns a float.
&gt; 7.0 % 3.0 = 1.0. Because, obviously, you cannot divide 1.0 by 3.0... I mean, how can a modulo produce a rational number is beyond anyone's comprehension, but being coherent isn't what bothers Python developers. What would you expect 7.0 % 3.0 to return? And before you answer, what would you expect 7.1 % 3.0 to return? Or 7.1 % 3.1? 
Why are you shitting on this guy for making something and putting it up on github. Even if it’s not good at least he’s working on something and learning. It’s definitely “useful” in the sense he’s developing some sort of skill
Thank you! 
Depending on how advanced you want it, there are multiple choices: ansible, jenkins, rundeck, script-server. Please note, that all of them will require a running web server. Another alternative would be CGI
i guess you're on windows, there's no really comfortable way. Just download Anaconda it comes with most things you'll ever need.
&gt;For instance, in Python, you can compute congruence of a rational number modulo another rational number. Why shouldn't it be possible ? You can compute modulo on polynomials functions, but you can't on real values ? Just stick with the definition : x % y is the rest in the euclidean division x // y. And that's what is implemented, just try : 7.5 % 3, it's equal to 1.5 which totally make sense. I'm sorry man, but you're talking about things you never heard and cannot believe that you are wrong :)
I share the same feeling. Pseudocode is similar to VB and a lot of features in pseudocode may develop bad habits for students, like "=" for equal. Just sticking with python may be a much better choice since it's already simple enough.
thx
Cool! Do you want to link to your project here? It would be great to collaborate.
? Of course it can. I've done plots with millions of data points. Obviously with that many points you need to start thinking about what you are trying to achieve and whether aggregation can convey the message in a simple way but matplotlib can technically handle it fine.
Or miniconda so you don't download all the packages in anaconda, this way you just install what you need.
What do you think about R? Is it better?
Interesting. Could have been the type of plot or the data, but I know I'm not the only one who has had problems with matplotlib and large data... thats how i found bokeh.
From what I've read, probably. Haven't used it though, so I can't speak from experience.
OP, cross-post this to /r/HamDevs if you haven't already.
Well what do you mean supported? It’s open source and actively developed.
&gt; Why shouldn't it be possible ? This is normally answered in the context of high-school algebra, but I'll try nevertheless. Modulo arithmetic is only defined (makes sense) for something like integers. Because it is defined using identity `A * B + m = C`. But, for rationals, `m` is always `0` because rationals are closed under multiplication. So, it doesn't really make sense to ask questions like these about rationals: &gt; What is the smallest common denominator? *(It's always 1)* &gt; Are A and B, arbitrary rationals in the same congruence class? *(They are)* Subsequently, an operation like `7.0 % 3.0` doesn't make sense (in the same way as triangle with three co linear points doesn't make sense). Your attempt at answering `1.0` of course fails, because `1.0` is divisible by `3.0`, the result is `1.3(3)`, or rather `1/3`, however you prefer to spell it. There is no "remainder" when you divide two rationals. The only exception when you cannot divide rationals, is when you divide by zero, but that doesn't really help with reminders. 
I believe I have created the [longest playlist on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/max.strange/playlist/5SwCIuMKEF1lzt1mBUXS0K?si=hcdKLesaRIadEAAKDQQCwg) using a python script. The official limit is 10,000 songs but mine has almost 11,000. I managed to sneak in an extra 951 songs before the spotify servers realised. The whole playlist in just Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!! by the Vegaboys.
I thought like the main developers stopped working on it.
Unless you have a huge number of iterations and the iterations itself don't take much time, the overhead is minimal. I tested it (with n=1): 100000 iterations of a sleep(0.001) loop without tqdm 16.02s 100000 iterations of a sleep(0.001) loop with tqdm 16.24s → 0.22s overhead 100000000 iterations of an empty loop without tqdm 2.83s 100000000 iterations of an empty loop with tqdm 16.40s → 13.57s overhead For most practical use cases the overhead should be negligible.

You generally don't want types to diverge, so if you have `float("nan") // 3` evaluating to `float("nan")`, your types are predetermined.

Thanks for the suggestion and will try to make it more clean.
Thanks for your opinion. 
Here's an [interesting video](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9yz993/what_does_it_take_to_be_an_expert_at_python_i/) that was posted a few days ago. [TL;DW](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9yz993/what_does_it_take_to_be_an_expert_at_python_i/ea6ekv1/)
I read your comment before watching so I was prepared to stay a bit longer, but then left after the second question.
An annoying calculation that boils down to a complicated control flow issue. 
Shooting people in the head takes skill. So does pickpocketing. Learning neither is useful, nor a worthwhile pursuit, and no one should be lauded for doing either. The fact that it's unethical _is_ the reason for shitting on it. Putting your bad faith work on Github and slapping a "this is for educational purposes only" disclaimer on it implies three things; 1st, you already know that it's unethical, otherwise you wouldn't be trying to pathetically disclaim responsibly for it, 2nd, you're unaware that such a disclaimer doesn't in any way protect you from liability if someone does use it, and 3rd, your code is clearly too bad to monetize and so no one should be learning from it anyway. Also, didn't say anything about him personally... kid apparently works at Best Buy and wants to improve himself and move up in the world, great. In my work I tend to help get people like that hired and help them on their career path; just not the ones dumb enough to put a bunch of training-wheels-on script kiddie crap on Github as a resume piece. Now, if it had actually been remotely interesting, or done something more than just try to get an idiot user to give it admin access and then shell out a bunch of trivial shell commands, I wouldn't necessarily move his name on to the "never even consider for interview" pile.
Newbie here. I am always confused about using plt.plot(...) Or fig, ax = plt.subplots() and then ax.plot(..) or just using dataframe.plot()/series.plot() or using seaborn.
Thank you so much bhai!
Learning is great, but you could have done _anything_ else with the same set of skills... by writing and promoting a low quality exploit -- you use **subprocess** poorly on Windows, your file handling is barely adequate, and there's about a half dozen places where an uncaught exception will leave a trail of evidence behind -- you just advertise yourself as a not-very good programmer who is also unethical. Literally _anything_ ethical that uses the same basic tools would be a better idea.
What? This is nonsense. Use bokeh if you want interactive dashboards but the size of the data is not a differentiating factor here. 
Hey there.... No worries!! Watch it on your free time. The difference amount the 3 is in your usage.plt.plot only allows you to plot one figure. However ax.plot allows you to plot multiple plots in one figure. If you just want to plot one figure, you don't need to use ax.plot. Seaborn is a python library that is built using matplotlib to visualize complicated data. Sometimes if you do that using matplotlib, you will need to write a lot of code. Seaborn simplifies that by providing you with some built-in methods. So it all depends on what you want. I will make some tutorials on seaborn very soon. Btw, if you go through the tutorials, you will exactly know the difference! So make sure you subscribe so that you can come back whenever you want.
Pleasure bro !!!
This is a great vid. Just as a general FYI, TensorFlow requires AVX CPU capability, which is not present on some older chips. I have an AMD Phenom II, which doesn't have that capability. If you're in a similar boat, you'll have to use an older TF (I think 14.1 will work), or build it from source.
I have since had a play. Examine the image you are using as the mask. I have only looked at monochrome images. The area to be left empty needs to be white. If you have an image which has a black "figure" on a transparent background, the entire image will be filled. You need to add a white background and flatten the result.
Thanks for the `ax.set()` pointer! That is way cleaner than calling `set_xlim`, `set_ylim` etc. etc.
Congratulations, but saying it now before it becomes a habit, please please follow pep8, don't use tab characters, the python community uses 4 spaces.
No worries, I am glad we answered the question and everything was clear :) We will try to experiment more on the q/a's during the course of the next python Belgrade meetups, as well as for the 2019 Pycon :) Cya next year !!!
Yepp i also made code like the one you said in the end . I am currently in the learning phase (got myself a free scholarship) and in the videos they taught a little about the pandas' plot function , and a relatively more about matplotlib and the plt.plot() functions. However ,am always trying to find a swiss knife kinda thing out of these methods like, "which of them would help me customize the most in my graphs?" And weirdly its always a mix of 2-3 libraries than a single silver bullet. Like recently i had to plot a time series. When plotted with plt.plot (**matplotlib function**) or ax.plot(), the time was in terms of daily date strings (around 400) and dates showed like a big black blob. So i had to use pd.to_datetime(..) (**pandas function** ) to get somewhat better graph. But that didn't looked satisfying, so i removed the pandas function ,created a manual loop, filtered the dates and then used as xticks. But suddenly i came across a stackoverflow answer saying you can just plot using series.plot() without a black blob , and that was it, it really handled all the dates without any conversions and showed a plot in terms of months You see the problem? Its always like that. I always thought that pyplot is the most advanced and to-go solution for making graphs. But turns out it also isn't the best bet and sometimes it can't provide a good graph without manual tweaks or tweaks from other libraries. Also, if series.plot / dataframe.plot are merely wrappers for matplot, how are they able to make better graphs without any data tweaking?
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it becomes awfully complicated. Fundamentally, Dask uses task-based parallelism and attempts to keep the partition in memory as much as possible. While you can partition a bag into multiple, new bags, it comes at the cost of loads of duplicated memory: if you're already nearing the threshold of what your machine can handle, it'll often put you over. Dampr instead uses the map-reduce paradigm to handle it's processing, entirely because it's good at those use cases. It's terrible at other things, of course, but that's the nature of tradeoffs I suppose. I have another project, tange, which implements dataflow processing in Rust that uses task parallelism behind the scenes, attempting to do the type of stuff Dampr does, but streams data to and from disk. It's an order of magnitude faster than Dask and Dampr, but you need to fiddle with the knobs a bit more and can run into weird issues like exhausting all the file descriptors.
Thanks for all the replies. Turns out it was the versions of numpy and matplotlib weren't compatible. I updated matplotlib to 3.0.1 and it's all working now
Thanks for the feedback and detail. /u/PinkFrojd has opened an issue regarding PEP 8 and it's on the next release. Doing a PEP 8 clean up will be part of my release cycle going forward for all projects!
Okay, but there's no extra special meaning in the complex plane than in the real numbers, both can be extended to include x/0 = infinity in a projective sense. Similar identities exists in other non-Field formulations such as Hyperreal and Hypercomplex numbers. However moving to a non-Field means you lose something, in this example of moving to a projective space you lose the identiy of [Multiplicative Inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse) and therefore you need to be careful about any previous understanding of Real or Complex numbers as it may have relied on that identity. 
I like Seaborn’s additional and convenience plots but I think I prefer my slightly modified style more. I guess it’s all personal preference. Matplotlib’s API(s) are far from perfect, consistent, complete, or easy. But if you’re willing to lookup what you need, make some tweaks as you go, and play, you can get a lot out of it.

A lot of things can be adjusted with ax.set. Unfortunately, some things that can't, e.g. tick rotation seem to require falling back to plt.xticks(rotation=xyz), which I find frustrating.
You’re right. Sorry, I might’ve been vague. I was wondering if there was a library for cleaning user input. You can definitely do it with the standard library, but I was worried we would miss a step
you posted this here a few days ago and are spamming the hell out of every place else as well.
&gt;However ,am always trying to find a swiss knife kinda thing out of these methods like, "which of them would help me customize the most in my graphs?" And weirdly its always a mix of 2-3 libraries than a single silver bullet. I think it depends on the level of customization you want. I don't know much about the plotting stuff in pandas, but seaborn does a good job of allowing high level customization over color, size, markers, etc. &gt;Like recently i had to plot a time series. When plotted with plt.plot (**matplotlib function**) or ax.plot(), the time was in terms of daily date strings (around 400) and dates showed like a big black blob. So i had to use pd.to\_datetime(..) (**pandas function** ) to get somewhat better graph. But that didn't looked satisfying, so i removed the pandas function ,created a manual loop, filtered the dates and then used as xticks. But suddenly i came across a stackoverflow answer saying you can just plot using series.plot() without a black blob , and that was it, it really handled all the dates without any conversions and showed a plot in terms of months I think the problem is that you plotted against strings. Matplotlib, or any plotting tool, has to work under a set of assumptions. A good goal of any library is to minimize the complexity so that the code is easily understood. In your case, when you plot against strings matplotlib assumes they are "categories", and will implicitly create an x axis with limits 0..nstrings-1, with a tick and label at each one. If you converted your strings to datetime.datetime objects, it would plot the way you want. Or you could make a numpy array of dtype datetime/datetime64, and it would also understand. You could argue that matplotlib should have some magic built in to detect date-y values for x, but you would never want it to check all x data against this first, since it would slow things down a lot. Maybe it could check the first element of x and assume all others are homogeneous, but it doesn't. &gt;You see the problem? Its always like that. I always thought that pyplot is the most advanced and to-go solution for making graphs. But turns out it also isn't the best bet and sometimes it can't provide a good graph without manual tweaks or tweaks from other libraries. (virtually) all other plotting in python is built on top of matplotlib. Go-to I think is field dependent (in the numerical sciences, absolutely. In statistical fields, I think seaborn has that crown now). &gt;Also, if series.plot / dataframe.plot are merely wrappers for matplot, how are they able to make better graphs without any data tweaking? Because they implicitly / silently tweak your data. After to\_datetime the column/series is of a type that matplotlib understands as a date. The series plot may contain the magic check I talked about above, I don't know. Pandas is something like over a million lines of code; it does a lot of often very complicated things to make your life easier.
Interesting. So if I'm understanding any of this, are you saying that something similar to dampr could be achieved with dask if the chunk/block size was set to match the CPU cache/block size (along with some performance penalties)? Again, I usually deal with dask arrays so any out of memory errors for me can be "worked around" by limiting number of workers or reducing the chunk size.
Wow, you took each question down in a fantastic way. Thanks. Yepp , i also came to know about the datetime-string problem causing black graphs, back then. Pandas really has some magic built in , if it has a million lines of code. It always loads and runs instantly in notebooks.

Loading or running ehhh. Pandas is a really heavy import with a 1-2s (or so) import time on fast workstation machines, where a smaller pure python library may import in less than a millisecond. When writing your own libraries, it's certainly a dependency to be very careful about if you care about import time. &amp;#x200B; It runs quickly largely because it is itself, or it wraps, code that is C/C++/FORTRAN. E.g. I think the internals of a dataframe is some structure with an ensemble of numpy arrays, and numpy ends up doing almost all of the heavy lifting (fairly quickly, as numpy is pretty highly optimized).
Lmao if Deezer has a similar API i'm going to have fun
60 nano seconds per iteration according to the docs.
Dask arrays are an interesting example which I'd have to think about; I was specifically solving a different use case. I assume you're using Dask to compute math across a large number of workers?
One note: python is flexible enough that you can use it poorly like Matlab. It’s better to learn to do the same type of thing but the python way. I really like [SciPy Lectures](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/)
Yes, but I would say "large" number of workers is around 4 or 8 on most user workstations. Specifically I use it with my SatPy library through the xarray library: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9zz9nb/satpy\_010\_released\_python\_library\_for\_processing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9zz9nb/satpy_010_released_python_library_for_processing/) &amp;#x200B; In a simplified case we are reading satellite data from a NetCDF file that could be 22696x22696 pixels. We split this array in to 4096x4096 chunks. Depending on the operations and available memory a user may want to reduce the chunk size to 2048x2048 and/or reduce the number of workers doing the processing. On my laptop I have 8 logical cores so 8 workers is the default setting but I sometimes limit dask to 4 workers. This limits the number of overall chunks in memory at any one time.
Matlab has its advantages but it’s really not a good language. It has no notion of name spaces and object oriented is awkward and hard to use. Plus, at least in my experience, Octave is a good bit slower than Matlab while Python is comparable depending on the task
What were you trying to do?
Oh man, that takes me back. I used to work on weather impact prediction, specifically on measuring the uncertainty of how different meteorological factors (e.g. turbulence, icing, thunderstorms, etc.) would affect aviation equipment. Rather than just red/green for go no go, we could figure out the actual error bars along a flight path so decision makers could determine their own risk factors. For example, sending a rescue helicopter to save a capsized boat would have different risk tolerances than a commuter flight. I digress. Let me think on it some more but I'd be willing to bet Dask is the right model for the work you're doing; my understanding is that it was built specifically to handle this type of array computation work. I have a hunch that figuring out the right chunk size to fit in your L3 cache would yield faster clock time than a paradigm change.

I wish more people would know about [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) instead of the defunct/dead python ggplot.

&gt; What is currying? Are you sure this should be part of the list? Python doesn't naturally support currying, and it's not something that I would anticipate an interviewer focusing on in a Python interview.
Thanks for sharing. I had no idea plotnine was available. It looks great from the GitHub readme. I will give it a try and spread the word.
I would check out these two links as they are probably the best resources for learning MATPLOTLIB: [link1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb) link2(http://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html)
YW! If you like R's dplyr, there's also [plydata](https://github.com/has2k1/plydata) If you noticed, it's also by the same folks that developed plotnine.
Yeah I usually start with Seaborn or Pandas plotting commands and then modify the returned Matplotlib objects if necessary.
I use tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment. 
Were you using matplotlib to bin the histogram or were you precomputing it manually and just using matplotlib to plot the bars?
A text message, like 'sup, how you're doing?'. And i don't know if i should use TCP or UDP, as UDP is often more used for streaming.
Thank you so much - that looks perfect! Jeff
Sure, do that. But prepare first by deciding on the protocol and provide more details to people there.
Yeah the options that dask provides are something we are pretty fond of. I was originally asking to see if dampr could some day be absorbed in to dask as a better implementation of Bag or DataFrame groupbys.

I've loved every one of your interviews so far. I do machine learning professionally, and most of the interviews that I hear are techincal, the philosophical approach that you've taken makes the interviews fascinating and unlike anything else I've found.

Is it ok to post an alternative to tqdm? I used to use tqdm but then I wrote a graphical one and there was no turning back. Even with a command line program it's nice to see a graphical view with statistics on how things are going, how long I'll have to wait. The PySimpleGUI solution is a single line of code you add to loops and the result is this kind of window: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48987097-c2bccf00-f0e9-11e8-82a3-66822cdf99d4.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48987097-c2bccf00-f0e9-11e8-82a3-66822cdf99d4.gif) Add this line of code to the inside of a loop and you're done. No setup nothing but an import and a line of code calling the meter: sg.OneLineProgressMeter('Inner Loop', j+1, max_inner, 'inner') It's not horribly inefficient, but I'm not going to claim a 60ns call time. If there are tons of iterations then call it only every 1,000 or 10,000 times through the loop. &amp;#x200B;

Wow that is great. I have been saying python needs a library that includes similar functionality for a long time. The data science community will benefit greatly from this. I sent the link to several colleagues just now. Thanks again!
&gt;Making sure you (or anyone else) can come back later and change and adapt those instructions easily Often, utilizing classes et al. is the way to make this happen, as it becomes reusable. DRY is a huge python mantra. You are, however, correct, in that trying to be *too* clever leads to code that is unreadable by anyone but you. Use the right tool for the job within the time frame you have, and make sure, via comments and documentation or code clarity that it is easy for someone else to pick up and understand. That, however, is not a problem exclusive to python, it is a philosophy to take with you no matter what you're writing or what you're writing it with.

Machine learning in the future probably but now I am part of group project(between friends) which requires a lot of data scraping from websites and then processing that data for our various needs.

Descriptors are my least favorite part of Python (and arguably the most difficult and least intuitive part of it). Property decorators / setter decorators are usually enough for the basic to intermediate Python developer, but when you really have to pull out descriptors and go to town with them, it just feels ugly and wrong. I wouldn't call them magical creatures. I'd call them a necessary evil. I think OP missed a bit of the harder part where you want only descriptors and no property/setter decorators at all, and simply implement everything in the descriptor (read/write the data through the descriptor itself), you really have to jump through hoops to do that, because descriptors don't work that way, unless you trick them into doing it with weakrefs or reading/modifying the dict in the parent class via the descriptor __get__ / __set__ methods. If you don't believe me, this video explains it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvpNaWwx24 All in all, solid article by OP, for covering the good bits and leaving out the difficult stuff.

Although syntactically very similar to list/dict/set comprehensions, I would suggest including generators. Visually the only difference is that generators are framed in parens vs square brackets or curly brackets, but it's knowing when to use a generator vs a comprehension &amp; why generators can be better when used properly (read: drastically reduced memory requirements).
Look for books on machine learning, regression, statistics, and learn the ins and outs of the pandas and scikit libraries or spark for python. Do not try to look up books with the word “AI” in the title. They were written by managers of people who code and do nothing to actually help you with machine learning. They usually put sipits of code that someone else wrote and do a horrible job explaining it. The word AI is just a hot word these days but in reality they are still programming every bit of what the machine is doing with statistical features and tests built in. We are very far away from a conscious man made computer.

You make a case for it being impure. Is it also impractical?
IMO that's really not a an issue in regards to how the wrapper was written, but a side-effect of *anything* written with asyncio. The documentation is really great though, and I agree that it's a great way to get your feet wet with async.
Same, I use matplotlib in a tool at work that visualizes multiple lines with thousands of points and matplotlib is in no way a bottleneck. 
Integration into automation flows, integration into existing Python UIs, data already coming from Python code...

Also if you're already importing numpy and matplotlib (and maybe scipy.stats, pytables, etc) and then import panda, the pandas import time is greatly reduced. I think pandas triggering matplotlib import is part of why it's so slow. Notebooks with `%matplotlib inline` at the top probably appear to have very fast pandas imports. Just a theory.
This is exactly what seaborn is for. This is it's bread and butter.
Plots can be interactive (zoom and pan like Google maps to help explore your data) so you don't have to perform multiple clicks to change the axes bounds. It's is much easier to apply consistent styles across multiple plots. Much easier to make more complex plots. Much easier to group data on the plot by color/size/style with a legend and other common tasks. Easier to deal with transparency. Easier to deal with larger data than Excel can handle. Your plotting workflow is code that can be debugged and perfected and version controlled and reused for other projects. Really there are fewer and fewer reasons for me to open Excel even for trivial tasks when I could open a Jupiter Notebook just as easily and have a better product in less time in the end. I was an Excel power user who has been gradually becoming a python power user over the last 8 years.
I recommend you make an experiment where the division method is pulled from an integer, and revise your explanation, such that it fits the new empirical data.
Why can't it just guess at what you want? You gotta tell it and the behavior is consistent.
No, it's not impure, it's just nonsense to try to a find remainder of rational division. It's always zero. It's not because it's impossible or it doens't exist. It's just too simple and uninteresting. It's the same reason why we care about the identity like `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2`, but don't care about identities like `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 0`, `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 0 + 0` and so on. They all "work" but are useless.
So, 1. /r/learnpython 2. Don't post things with your name in it.
Hmm... I don't even know what those are? Haha
No, you are mistaken. When you think about clocks, you have an operation between rationals and integers, I'm talking about an operation between rationals (no integers). Your operation is not really "modulo", but it's close enough to appeal to the same intuition.
Operator and function are the same thing. 4.0/2.0 doesn't have an integer answer. Literally everything you just wrote is not just wrong, it's unsound (i.e. a word salad).
Ducks?
No, I get what your saying about the math. I'm just asking if you think the current result is more or less practical than if the result of the modulus operator on two floats were to be always 0. And furthermore, if modulo between an int and a float should also have a different result than what they do now?
Azure command line client. It's so screwed up that it makes you laugh a lot. But, a nice thing about it is that they screwed it up so badly, that you cannot even install it with `pip` or manually or w/e other mechanism, even though all of its parts are on pypi.org. I think, that in some sense, MS might have done this on purpose to laugh at all the nonsense that goes on in Python packaging. Had I had that much power, I'd probably do a similar stunt to illustrate how pathetic and stupid the process is.
Definitely Twitter API.
i am writing a sonarr/radarr telegram bot -- its super nice and easy to work with, went from nothing to working in about 2-3 hours
The only integer involved is that of the divisor; that is the `N` in R hours ≡ R hours + N · T hours (mod T hours) It's crazy to consider `R hours` and `T hours` to be integral quantities; they aren't unitless, and that an "hour" is defined such that `T` is integral is purely incidental and of notational convenience.
What's your exact beef with Python packaging?
It has been working for me without issue for about a month now. Do you use venv or is everything just in your OS?

I've enjoyed using the Todoist API. It's got a pretty nice official python library.
I’m sorry but that’s just wrong. I don’t know what you learn in high school algebra but here, in France, we learn in primary school (at about 8) that Euclidean division between x and y is the number of time you can multiply y to get just under x with an integer. The rest being later called “modulo”. Man, we can do this on functions, matrixes, integrals. You can even define Euclidean division on entire spaces. Stop arguing , you are actually talking about things you don’t understand.

I so so agree with you. I actually have a docker image just with az cli that I use for everything. 
Their Python API is weird as hell to. I mean it works perfectly fine, it just not Pythonic.... like AT ALL. The documentation borderline unreadable, and yet there's technically nothing wrong with it. My best guess is that they literally translated the C# API into Python. Some API calls will return a sort bastardized object that's just a list of key value pairs, with methods for finding the right keys, but it's not a dictionary. Later it seems like they actually discovers that dictionaries are a thing, but only for data that at least two levels deep in objects. Some method calls will take a string as an input... but there's no list of valid strings to input. You can technically input what ever you like, but there's only like 5 key words that actually does anything.
 a = 3.4e-7 b = format(a, '.8f') print(type(b)) print(b) &lt;class 'str'&gt; '0.00000034'
I think you mean 0.00000034... but they're the same number, you cannot "convert" them. If you want to _display_ then differently you'll have to look at [string formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) and specifically the "f" and "e" presentation types.

It's a shame you didn't go to college... you'd know that integer rings aren't limited to just integers, they could be functions, matrices, integrals and a lot of other things. So, your righteous indignation is really unwarranted. Yes, your premises are fine, your conclusions are wrong.

It's all prototype quality. Nothing really works when you try to use it for real. There are about ten different ways, and formats you can package your Python code, but none really works. Same tools give inconsistent results where you wouldn't expect it. Here are some things that are, basically, impossible to achieve today, while they are really trivial to solve: 1. Have multiple versions of the same package installed in your system (I don't need a single application to use them, just have them on my computer for different applications, without having to create virtual environment for every one, with 99% of duplicated code). 2. Bundle and later on discover files that aren't Python code. It works inconsistently, depending on the version of package manager you use, whether you use Egg or Wheel, what operating system you use that on, and probably things like phases of the moon and weather on Titan. 3. Package test with your code. It kind of works... the first 50 or so percents of, but then it fails miserably. 4. Have configuration that ensures that you install the same version of your application when you need it. Every tool that's been written for this purpose in Python fails to deliver on the promise. You can install the same thing using simple setup.py, and after 100 of times of observing the same behavior, get something different. 5. Ensure that the versions of your packages that you upload to pypi.org make sense together (this is what's been illustrated by Azure cli). They have dependencies like: X 2.0.0 requires Y &gt;= 2.0.0, X &gt;= 2.0.0 Y &gt;= 2.0.0 requires Z &gt;= 2.0.0 Z &gt;= 2.0.0 requires X &lt;= 1.0.0 So that it's simply impossible to install, but upload API don't verify this. 7. Provided multiple version assignment satisfy your library's requirements, have a strategy to choose which group of packages do you want to install (i.e. the newest, the oldest, some other tie-breaking strategy maybe?) 8. Extract package version information from the package itself, rather than the place it was loaded from (that's plain retarded: why even bother putting this metadata into the package, if you just ignore it?) And the list goes on, but, frankly, I don't want to continue, this is just to give a taste of how immature and broken the whole thing is. It's definitely not an exhaustive account of all the evils that are there.

I have many things: Docker images, buildroot OVA images, virtual environments of many kinds included. But, really, you are asking the wrong question: the correctness of a program ins't established by observing it to work sometimes. I actually read the code and was able to just prove that it is not possible for it to work in certain conditions. What happened to you, most likely: you simply didn't read the output of `pip install` because it's too long, and the error message itself takes about 3 screens to read, so it doesn't immediately jump at you and shout "this is an error". You just ran `pip install` and assumed it worked because you tried to use it and it sort of worked.
I've been to college and still am. I just didn't do group theory. But as you seem to understand what I'm saying. Why the heck are you saying stupid things ? Modulo is defined from euclidean division. And euclidean division is : how many integer times can I multiply y to get close to x I've been doing this with polynomials, matrices, float numbers for float precision issues. So yes, I know it's right. If it's not, I'll give you the mail of the Professor who taught me this, he'll be more than pleasured to explain you.

Not all of it is fun. When I was writing something that would mirror a subreddit's modlog to Discord one of the responses for confirming a post had "confirm_ham" attached to it. That's not a typo. I still don't know what it meant since this part of their API doesn't seem to be well documented (or I just couldn't find a list of possible responses) and I haven't seen that response since. Oh, and that same field will also have full human readable sentences for other mod actions.

You should spend a little bit of time trying to make a minimal repro of the problem so you can post code. Try to get it down to the minimal number of controls to demonstrate the issue and strip out everything that isn't building the GUI. This may in fact help you troubleshoot it yourself as you'll be able to see more clearly if you only have say a window with 2 controls in it, and it makes it easier to play with fixing it, and certainly easier for other people to take a quick look at. /u/DaysBeforeSpring has probably put you on the right path, that you're packing controls beyond the right edge.

All kinds of files, to be honest. I suppose the most frequent files would be files like PDF, audio, video, etc. Size is not exactly an issue? I would prefer if the encoded content would be just as big as the file, and not too large than the original file. 
Huh, TIL. What's weird is that other times a post was approved that variable in the response would be empty. It literally only returned that once. Still, the responses the modlog provides in the API don't seem to be properly documented on reddit's site (I searched a long time for them), which has just resulted in a lot of trial and error to get it working.
Then I guess that brings me to the next question. Why are you taking input as base64 at all? What's the use case for this?

Maybe? I mean, the posts were identical in terms of content and the account was the same too (it's a test account I setup). I also sent similar posts before it and when they were manually approved they also didn't return "confirm_ham". It's possible I did something slightly different, but I'm not sure what. In any case, more detailed docs listing these responses from Reddit would be nice. :P

I am working on an app which I ca't give too much details about. RIght now I have been taxed with building a GUI as we are moving away from Excel VBA(thank God!). I opted for Kivy. Note, it's the first I do UI programming in any meaningful manner. I know PyQt is sort of the standard, but I don't have $500 to drop for a commercial license. Kivy is somewhat badly documented. Also it lacks a designer. But I am making progress. It's a good library. So I am thinking of writing a few blog posts about using it. For example, I had to build a spreadsheet viewer(importing data form excel and showing it). I had to go around many forum posts and finally get the hang of it. I think that's going to be my first blog post, at least for people in the future wanting an easy solution.

Basically, one of the issues with bringing something that is async into your project, is that it should ideally be called by something async. As a result, you'll start making your callers async, then everything that calls those callers, then everything calling those, until you end up making the vast majority of your code base async. (I've seen it referred to as async creep.) This isn't necessarily a problem, most code bases could use a good refactoring. It's more that refactoring takes a lot of time that some people aren't willing to spend. If you're starting a new project from scratch, it isn't a problem at all. In fact, I'd highly recommend giving it a go.
You can recreate the Spotify app yourself (not completely of course, no offline music, only limited to premium accounts, etc). If you don't like something in the official app you can create your own.

Hey there, I’ve not heard of a python full stack dev - is that always using flask / django frameworks ? I started using flask a couple of months ago but wasn’t aware python was used in proper site development !
If you look at the Python string library API, this should all become obvious. If it doesn't, you have other problems and us getting you past this homework problem won't solve them.
pages between 202-206 look helpful though. 
(Setting aside the the daunting and exaggeratedidea of reimplementing everything I take for granted in Django, ) I guess my worry is that async syntax doesn't look very intuitive to me when I'm reading it. Maybe it will once I've crossed that bridge. I like python (partially) because it's easy it read what's going on when you come across code foreign to you. It provides intuitive, human-readable syntax with indents, f-strings, iterators, comprehensions, and low-level type literals. async/await feel like curly braces waiting for indentations to come along.

Please if you have any other questions or need further clarification, let me know, I want to help you help me. import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect('C:\file/path/database.db') c = conn.cursor() # Execute Test command, NOT print or store c.execute("select * from info") # Store it # Print it # For each result in that list/stored object,

A lot of times that should be handled in the SQL

I think [this article](https://hackernoon.com/a-simple-introduction-to-pythons-asyncio-595d9c9ecf8c) is what finally helped me get a better handle on asyncio.

&gt; I also sent similar posts before it and when they were manually approved they also didn't return "confirm_ham".

True, but if time isn't critical, you could try compressing it anyway, and if it is bigger, use the uncompressed version.
&gt; Descriptors are my least favorite part of Python (and arguably the most difficult and least intuitive part of it). You've never done metaclass programming them, I take it.
the standard is base64 and is pretty straight forward to implement also to avoid data corruption you should implement some kind of checksum, MD5 is quick and processor efficient to implement (with empty "key") 
First, nice project! I've tinkered with deterministic password generators as well, I could not find an intuitive solution for services that require periodical password resets. How can a user know what the correct password iteration is without storing data about the passwords. finally, if you are going to put this in production, it would be wise replace the homemade crypto by official / tested implementations.
Thanks!
Yes, one use case I’ve seen is a class that inherits from multiple other classes for its functionality, but doesn’t need any additional functionality of its own. 
Only if you want to do sentiment analysis? 
Bot self update? That sounds neat can you elaborate 
r/learnpython
Yeah man, totally a dick move to include the `?sub_confirmation=1` part in the url, so that anybody who clicks the link will be greeted with a "Are you sure you want to subscribe to buildwithpython?" message, as if I opted in to subscribe. I don't know if it is intentional, but if it was, it is a real dick move.
The subreddit's filter was set so that all posts required approval to be visible (probably should've made that more clear earlier). Usually, when approving posts that have been filtered it returns `unspam`, but in one case it returned `confirm_ham` instead. Looking into it, `confirm_ham` is returned when approving a post that hasn't been removed/filtered (like you said), so I'm confused as to why it appeared when approving a filtered post when it should've returned `unspam` instead.
Oh nice! I need to up my API game big time. Gonna take a dive into this. Thanks very much.

While a little dated, the Spacewalk APIs are very well documented and easy to use. (xml-rpc) For those that don't know: This is for Linux systems management and is the upstream for Red Hat Satellite 5. A combination of Cron and those APIs can get your OS updates automated in enterprise environments. The successor is Foreman/Katello (upstream for Red Hat Satellite 6), which is a REST API.
PyCharm
This question has been asked to death. Please do a search of this subreddit and r/learnpython; you'll have your answer in seconds.
Text editor is not equal to IDE. Text editor is just purely text editor. There may be few plugins to improve the code editing for specific language. There are ton of plugins for python for text editors like Sublime / VSCode / Atom. I prefer Sublime but it is paid (with unlimited trial though). IDE: Pycharm without any doubts.
Oh yeah forgot about that. Usually I add a doc string to all classes including those so it ends up not being a problem.

No, they just made it cost-prohibitive to make any actually useful twitter integration. For bots and stuff you'd use with ML everything is still fine, but if your app needs to receive notifications or feeds of tweets in real-time, you're limited to like 1 account/feed per app for the free tier. So, third party twitter apps like hootsuite/plume/etc. wont be able to have its users receive notifications, unless they get the business api subscription which is like $2000+ per month for a certain number of accounts (and then a certainly larger unquoted price for even more)

For number 6 should add Raymond Hettinger to your list!
its an end point for users to interact with sonarr/radarr -- its easier to train users on telegram or discord than other software as long as you give them an easy interface life is pretty easy
Thanks really cool on my phone
A couple I have used include: - DarkSky - Transport API - Telegram - Twitter - Google Safe Browsing - Mapbox for Geocoding - VirusTotal - Warframe API - Marvel Comics - YouTube
What kind of API? Is it a remote, network API? The API to your graphics card? A Windows API?
r/learnpython
I did post this in learn python. They failed me.
&gt; Also, decorators that can maintain the same behavior with or without arguments, those are a pain in the a** to write. Ohhh, those are rough. I always wonder if someone has written a library to solve that problem in a reusable way. I almost wrote one but it was easier to hack up that one ugly instance of it...
Look up WebSockets
Hey! Thanks for your response. I think it's fair to say this is a Restful api. By this I mean I'm issuing GET requests to an endpoint with certain parameters. [Here it is](https://developers.unbabel.com/docs/translation-list-update)
Thanks! I think exactly what I was looking for.
PyCharm for repitition... it is the best Python Editor out there IMO.
How can I forget him ;)
Bidding war... $14.75 each.

If the API does not offer any sort of callback or websocket implementation, then the only thing you can do is poll it multiple times.
I haven't been using Python so much lately, but `requests` is one that has me going back to it. Very programmer friendly.
Oh, they seem to provide a callback url. I can use that. Thanks!

Working with random numbers.
&gt;Focus more on code questions. Even if your candidate has to answer them in sudo code. This tells you about developer potential. A good dev could learn the answers to all the questions at the top in 3 or 4 hours. A bad dev will never be able to write good sudo code for a complex problem. You're right, but this questions is focused on junior devs. They usually don't have any code experience yet, so I filter them by theory questions
Its a touch of self promotion but the NHL API has been great fun to mess with, discovering parts that aren't documented yet is pretty fun I think.
Any links or sources for teaching API's using this API?
If you’re referring to functools.partial, that is for partial application. That is similar, but distinct from, currying.

Probably best asked at the learnpython sub. However I can add that sites like CodeAcademy are a good way to get started with the basics. There’s also learnpython.org which can take you quite far for free. The absolute best way though, is to give yourself a real world problem. Then solve it. Start small even if there’s an existing solution. Build a blackjack card game, a simple calculator with an interface etc. Move onto another small project but importantly, after a little while, go back to the code you’ve written and review it. Could you have made it more efficient, more resilient to bugs etc. And then refactor your code. It’s even better if you can find a peer to learn with and review each other’s code. A lot of your time learning should be spent reading code of others. Good luck further!
Thank you, much appreciated.

An app that receives alarm events (in pieces) from a SCADA system printing to a network generic/text only printer and processes it before logging to SQL Server. It's amazing how the socket 'server' worked first go and how little code it all took. Thank you Python ecosysyem. Next, build a small GUI for setting it up, a web front end with data analysis and add in some previously written auto generated Excel reports. Maybe later try straight to SQL and/or OPC A&amp;E instead of printing but the print method handles the backlog for me which is nice of it to do.

Given that the EEG is periodic and (probably) fairly regular, what about something in the frequency domain? FFT + thresholding for various frequency components?
Mercure looks very nice. Any independent reviews anywhere you know of?
The EEG is not periodic at all, from a large variety of articles I read, the perfect window size is 12, because with that window we can see some time dependency. And the sinal is already normalized, so we don't need to the preprocessing, just the preditor and the entropy code.
Your bad taste is urgent

Make a class, (Like an OOP Class, not a school one :D ) for each Test/Student, put in the __add__ Magic Method and you can easily add them up. You can do the input via input("your message to display") Just make a few inputs one for every field you have. If you don't want to go into OOP you can still build the dictionary with inputs and then use append to add to your array (it's called list in Python)

Well done! I always like terminal apps since other than IDE and browser, I'm pretty much in terminal mode all day. I wish all the modern sites have terminal based reader.
Please read the sidebar and refer to /r/learnpython 
[https://pastebin.com/gt5FrVMH](https://pastebin.com/gt5FrVMH) &amp;#x200B; ok here's the code, if you want to use the dictionary-way put a True in line 6. Below is an approach using a class. If you want to actually use this it may be wise to make the constructor of the class take arguments and pass the inputs in rather than having input in the class body because it may very well be possible that at some point such a class is needed without input somewhere else in the code. &amp;#x200B; If there's anything unclear just hit me up :)
Actually: I just noticed that you also posted in r/learnpython: If you don't get everything in the code I sent don't worry, there's some stuff that you don't need that often in python (in the OOP part) so don't be discouraged by it. As for the upper part: try to understand what it does, if there's something you don't get either hit me up or watch the python introduction by sentdex on youtube (a truly great resource) or read in the official python docs. And if you understand it try improving it ;)

Just to clarify, are you saying you want to write a py program, put it on a USB stick and plug it into a projector for it to work? If yes, this won't work. The projector likely doesn't not have Python installed. You won't be able to run anything. The USB in projector is for a basic filesystem explorer.
Your code is actually really amazing, but I'm afraid it's a bit above me for the moment, but I will surely save it and look at it in the future :)
No worries! Thanks for the response.
No the projector can be hooked up to the PC, I just want to output an image directly to the projector. Essentially manually writing individual frames to HDMI port on the PC, which is hooked up to the projector.
You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could that you didn't stop to think if you should

That's not a 404-error / response, but a 401-error / response, which is quite different. The HTTP 401 response is returned when you are unauthorized to call the specified URL.

Because its a tuple? Maybe try change the message to string as in msg1 = "You rolled " + str(rand)
Because you told it to do so: `msg1` is a tuple. If you want to send a formatted string, you can do: ``` msg1 = f"You rolled: {rnd}" ```
As much as I HATE this sub's recent annoying habit of doing /r/learnpython for anything and everything that remotely looks like a question.... This is certainly one of the cases it's warranted.. 1: Bad idea, don't override the default Types in Python True is a boolean value and should stay that way. 2: Get rid of the :, this isn't Pascal (and even it would whine with that extra space)
Thank you! Still rather new to python, just come from VB console!

Ask everyone over at r/learnpython they’ll have some ideas for you. 
Yes, a guy thinks he's so good at vim that it's a good use of time for everyone to watch him type for two hours.
Plotting networks is a lot of fun and an intuitive way of understanding whatever problem you're dealing with. &amp;#x200B; It's also a bit useful for visualizing web application design but that's just me being a graph nerd.
Iterate over the list using a for loop and check for equality 
I meme, i hate em as much as him. I can however keep myself from dipping into the pleasures of the masses. 
 Number = 15 List = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] result = Number in List result = False
This is gonna look so amazing with bspwm!
Thanks, will have a look at the one you suggested
Thank you for the suggestion and link. will definitely look at those.

Will do thanks!
Most of the logic is in the hub, and in the browser (EventSource).
Since Gmail cannot accept Zip file exe attachment, so I decided to upload it in Gdrive instead. My bot, pepper, has a background thread always checking for new update in Gdrive. Soon, I’m going to include messenger chat with my bot. Currently, she is listening in email for my inputs and Gdrive for her self-updates. 
Nice! I actually came across Nameko last year. I liked the look of it back then but never took the time to dig in. I love the Technology Radar though. Time for a proper look I think. 
Why put an image with watermark on your desktop? Are you all suffering from severe advertisement addiction?
list( Number == i for i in List) this will give you a list with entries = True for matching ones. you can replace == with whatever comparison you want
So 25 lines on the back end, 35 lines on the front end and hundreds of lines hidden away in a third party?
Very interesting, i just started learning coding and this is the kind of stuff i want to dedicate to, but i am a noob really, would you mind explaining to me why would you need several programming lenguages to do this kind of stuff? or point me to a tutorial? Very much appreciated. Great post OP.
[dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) does something fairly similar, but automatically raises a PR on github with an update to your dependency file (which obviously runs the tests too).
Thx!
Duhhhhh
What matters here is what allows the protocol itself, which is public, free, and relatively easy to implement by yourself if you don’t want to rely on a third party (which is open source, and small too, but I haven’t counted the lines). Anyway, Python itself, and the browser, and the libc, and the OS... are thousands of lines of third party code you rely on too.

 I think it is because it: - is natively supported by browsers, no lib nor SDK required (built on top of HTTP and server-sent events) - is compatible with all existing servers, even those who don't support persistent connections (serverless architecture, (Fast)CGI...) - has built-in connection re-establishment and state reconciliation (implemented directly on browsers client-side thanks to EventSource) - has a JWT-based authorization mechanism (securely dispatch an update to some selected subscribers) - leverages HTTP/2 multiplexing (while WebSocket isn’t compatible with HTTP/2) - is designed with hypermedia APId in mind, but also supports GraphQL - is auto-discoverable through the web linking RFC - supports message encryption - can work with old browsers (IE7+) using an EventSource polyfill - supports connection-less push in controlled environments (e.g. browsers on mobile handsets tied to specific carriers) The project is still in an early stage, and I would very appreciate any feedback (good or bad).
I tried to keep it short, but whenever I see comments like yours, I get overly excited and want to shove as many resources and as much explanation as I can into one comment. Also, this was a hackathon project so I used the programming language that takes the least time to develop in (Python) and used a lot of bad practices to implement this system. Note: I am using pong as an example, since it is the only game we implemented. Whenever I mention **_game state_** I'm simply refering to (in the case of pong) the location of the paddles, the location of the ball, the velocity of the ball, and the score. _The following headers are directly related to the names given on the diagram._ ## Client (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): Pretty simple - we used vanilla JS, and bootstrap. Since it was a hackathon I took the simplest approach to keeping the client in sync with the game state. Simply polling (a.k.a. AJAX-requesting over and over again) the current game state from the backend and updating the Pong rendering if it changed. ## Backend (Python and Flask): More accurately, this is the _web_ backend. Here I used Python (see resource 1) and Flask (see resource 2 &amp; 3) to interface with the client. The purpose of the backend was to simply serve the frontend files, get the user's bot API URLs, and serve the state to the frontend for rendering. Here, authentication is done by setting a user's cookie to their username and check it on every request since it didn't need to be a secure application at the hackathon (DON'T DO THIS, check resource 4). ## Data Storage (Redis with [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)): Redis stores data by associating a value to a key. My keys were the game ids and the values were Python dictionaries used to store game state turned into a JSON string (this is not good practice but it worked for the hackathon). Redis is used for storing game state and usernames. The game state includes (in the case of Pong) the location of paddles, the location and velocity of the ball, and the bot urls. I chose Redis because I would be accessing the data store as fast as the bots responded (and it was easy to set up and use). ## Task Runner (Python): This was simply another Python program with a main while loop that would be analogous to the main game loop that most game engines use. Every loop, the script would check for active games (game states stored in Redis with the **start** flag equal to true). It would extract the bot urls from the game state and request the bot's next move from the bot APIs created by the user. ## Game Engine (Python): This is a module I wrote to calculate what the next frame of the game should be, given the bot's actions and the previous game state. This is what detected collisions, updates stores, calculates the physics of the ball movement, moves the paddles, etc. etc. So simply, you input the current game state and the players' (the bots) inputs, and it gives you back the next game state. ## Bot Server (JavaScript on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/)): Here I harnessed the power of [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) to allow users to simply write stateless bot logic and deploy their bots as a web API (see resource 7) with the click of a button. ## To answer the original question: why do you need several programming languages? In this case it was mostly due to platforms and development speed. If I were to built this into a real project, I would probably use Java or C# for the Task Runner and Game Engine because they are faster and have better multithreading capabilities. * I used Python because I know it very well and I can develop in it pretty quickly * Obviously, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because you have to on browsers * I used Redis (which is basically just a database) because it is fast and simple * I used JavaScript on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) because it is the only supported language ## Resources: 1.

Probably music, thinking of something I could do with that. Maybe plot out something about sales over time? Or how much more successful artists are that keep their music off streaming sites vs. ones that don't. Actually that sounds pretty cool.
Well yes, but I'm not at that level yet, and I can't get there unless I do other, more simple stuff.
Thank you! I did not know these existed.
Sorry bot-o but I think you’re wrong-o.
An example: In my town, the cinema tickets for the last Monday of the month are always discounted to 40% or less. My GF and I always go out to watch movies on those day. So I make a script scraping the website of the cinema to see if there is any movie that suit our taste and genre. The moral of the story here is: find something you repeatedly do by yourself on you PC or the internet, most likely it can be automated using python, and once you do that, it's very satisfying.
There you go. Now go chase down your data source. Spotify? There's an API for that. Go learn it. Local files? Probably a lot more interesting as you'll need to find them on disk, grab the exif, save it somewhere (a database?), start thinking about what it tells you. &amp;#x200B; It's still a bit of artiface as it's just for giggles, but this is how you really learn. &amp;#x200B; Go down that rabbit hole. See you on the other side.
Wow thank you very much for taking the time OP, super interesting lecture, i will definitely look deeper into the topic, thank you for the resources too!!
Other relevant quotes: *"They are distinct languages from the same family of languages. On the surface they look quite similar and they are designed using the same principles [...]"* *"On the other hand they are different enough that a Perl 5 program doesn't run on a Perl 6 compiler, or vice versa and different enough that automatic translation from one to the other is quite challenging. So if you know Perl 5, Perl 6 feels familiar, but under the hood a lot has changed."* *"Zoffix a member of the Perl 6 core team even felt that "Perl" is strongly associated with Perl 5, and as such Perl 5's alleged decline in popularity also drags down the reputation, and "marketability", of Perl 6"* *«The Perl 5 language is effectively blocked from releasing the next "major version", because Perl 6 is squatting on it. And were Perl 5 to release a "Perl 7", that would immediately paint Perl 6 as obsolete.

Another big difference, coming from your description because I have very limited experience with Perl, is that a great many Python 2 programs run fine in Python 3. Many popular projects supported both 2 and 3 for a long time.

&gt; Unlike with Python, the Perl community did not decide to actively sabotage the old language, so Perl 5 kept growing unrestrained Thus fracturing the community, which could instead have been working together to make a single language great instead of two different languages mediocre to the point of obsolescence. 
Perl 6 was released 2 years ago. Python 2.7 was released 2 years after Python 3. 
&gt; Thus fracturing the community That's unavoidable. You just can't force people to change languages because your [second system design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) is going to be so much better than the first, if only they'd rewrite most of their code in exchange for new bugs and performance regressions...
&gt; a great many Python 2 programs run fine in Python 3 You're wrong about that. &gt; Many popular projects supported both 2 and 3 for a long time. By going through great lengths to use a common subset of the two languages, usually by using a library like "six" for that.
\&gt; It has reasonable REPL support for data analysis, though there are better tools for the job for it. What are the better tools for that job?
&gt; Perl 6 was released 3 years ago. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6 : *"Development on Pugs, the first high-traction implementation, began in 2005, and there have been multiple Perl 6 implementation projects. Rakudo Perl 6 [...] releases a new version every month (including precompiled GNU/Linux packages); in July 2010, the project released the first Rakudo Star distribution, a collection of a Perl 6 implementation and related materials."*
I was talking about the initial x.0 release.
This confirms that python is the language I want to learn
It's case sensitive. true != True Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 27 2018, 04:59:51) [MSC v.1914 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; true Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'true' is not defined &gt;&gt;&gt; True True &gt;&gt;&gt; 
I’ve only ever dabbled in Perl, so I have no skin in that game, but it’s still a little sad to see the fracture. 
Dask via dataframes (so long as the dataset is small) or PySpark are designed for that usecase. Dampr, while can be used without problems, doesn't have the fleshed out APIs geared toward that problem set the others have currently!

Everything prior to the `6.c` release (December 2015) was considered to be a beta (or alpha) release.
😥
No, a lot of programs work just fine in both with no special steps. And a lot of other programs handle compatibility themselves since only a few functions are different. Only really complex and old projects need something like six.
&gt; Only really complex and old projects need something like six. I'm sorry, but this just isn't true. I mean, technically you can write cross-compatible code without intentional shims but it's really awkward and you're not making good use of the language.
I made this at Hack Western: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a0lyqp/this_weekend_i_hacked_together_an_online_bot/?st=JOZ7BQ6F&amp;sh=45ac5332.

Create a list of letters a - z and use the number given (-1) as the index for the list.
oh look, its a bunch of /r/Python folks who are downvoting at you for posting in /r/Python instead of /r/learnpython, but all of them are too lazy to explain that. Go play in /r/advancedpython or /r/pythoncirclejerk or wherever it is and stop downvoting n00bs. But it sounds like you're plotting like elevation data or something, where X and Y are coordinates, but Z is the value/elevation at that coordinate, in which case it makes sense to me for that z data to be separate. It's a 2d map with elevation. If you're trying to draw a pointcloud or extract a surface from a pointcloud, that's a different problem, I think. Numpy has a bunch of methods for reshaping and transposing etc, and most of them are pretty cheap

Now if only TravisCI decides to support Python 3.7...
&gt; Why?????? Because it make implementation code simpler. You can make assumption about your data (not ragged, same number of x points per row/ same number of y points per column). So you get a simple building block. (Basically you drop X,Y, and just use it as labelling for axes). I'm pretty sure working with the matplotlib folks to get a function to deal with what you have easier would be appreciated. It has not been done because likely no-one had the time to do it and matplotlib scipy numpy... are maintained by volunteers and getting things to "just work" take a lot of effort and time. You often need someone with the right use case to care about it and find the correct edge case in order to make maintainers confident the code is good to be released. Keep in mind that initially matplotlib in particular was a "copy" of matlab. Many reasons are now only historical – because matlab did it – and that feedback of users like you are valuable. If you are sure that you have all your point, you can use `np.meshgrid` to get your X and Y, and use `np.reshape` (with `-1` as a parameter to autodetect the dimensions, which is what option 3 does. ``` import numpy as np delta = 0.5 x = np.arange(-3.0, 4.001, delta) y = np.arange(-4.0, 3.001, delta) # as a 2d array 15x15 X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) Z = np.exp(-X**2 - Y**2) # 225x1 x = X.ravel() y = Y.ravel() z = np.exp(-x**2 - y**2) z.reshape((15,-1)) == Z # should be all True. # you might be able to use `z.reshape(*X.shape)` but I haven't tried # depending on your x, y, you might be able to also reshape those to avoid meshgrid. # you may want to poke at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html ``` You'll need to make sure things are ordered in x/y before reshaping the Z etc, as as you saw in the SO question there are alot of heuristics and check about the date that need to be done and doing this unconditionally can be alter performance. &gt; Half the time the outputs for a lot of contour interpolation algorithms are vectors, not 2D. I understand it's application in tensor-like notation, I'm not quite sure I follow what you mean here, but I'm not an expert on contour. &gt; but it's so much more difficult to work with. I disagree here but I may be a matter of opinion/use case. The "reshape"/"ravel" dance can be quite natural and you may not even realize you are doing it once you know it (this is not an excuse for forcing user to do it, just an observation). Once you pass the angry/annoyed stage, try to write a constructive issue on the matplotlib tracker, explaining why such a function would be useful and the limited use case it would cover. At least asking an update of the documentation/example/gallery to explain why. 
So... if I understand correctly, you're really just after isoplething sparse data, right? Given a collection of points (x_i, y_i) with a corresponding value z_i, you want to create a set of lines through the space (x, y) along which z is constant. There's nothing about this that requires the points to be in a regular form. Starting from an arbitrary point in space, you can approximate the gradient using some interpolation to the nearest points, and move a step where you end up holding z constant. But what you'll find is that the most computationally efficient ways to perform this analysis involve a preliminary step - constructing a regular grid of data and approximations to the field z = Z(x, y) along that grid. Think about it; how much easier is it to compute the gradient of a field at a point if you have neighboring approximations, allowing you to use finite differences, instead of some complicated weighting of nearby points? There are other approximations you can use, though. For instance, you can use a Delaunay triangulation and color each polygon using information from the points you used in it. You can then crudely work out some isolines from that data... but they may not look very good. 
I thought this was for math lol
Those are just things that are popular, which I also never cared about. You just gotta pick something that scratches an itch. Anything to get you to care about a project, so you don't quit, get excited when you add some new cool feature, and let it grow enough to teach you how to manage a large project. A well written 140,000 lined package may very well be easier to follow than one with 10,000 lines. That's not by accident.
Poor wording on my part. I'm referring to 2D planar boundary conditions. I have experimental data points that I'm trying to apply as a boundary condition. The only issue is the interpolation method in ANSYS Fluent is straight trash (the data that results from the interpolation will have a few points that are 10\^5 times higher than the experimental data points I give it), so I'm trying to do the interpolation outside of it right now.

Upvote for the introduction
Look into infinite plate splines. It's quite good for 3d and going to be even better for 2d. Don't think scipy has it. Matplotlib gas some things you wouldn't expect (e.g., PSDs), but I doubt it.
 I think what you really want to built is a TIN (triangular irregular network) Surface. Once you have a tin surface you should be able to create a raster (or griddata) from that or maybe even create contours from that. I haven’t looked into that kind of functionality for a while. Here is something that I hit that shows what I am talking about in terms of generating a tin https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/173365/generate-tin-from-elevation-data-in-python-no-arc Here is some an article about creating contours in qgis https://www.geodose.com/2018/05/how-to-create-contour-lines-in-qgis.html 
Definitely! More people have started using it lately which is great, and it is well maintained which is always a good sign for the future! When I was working at my first job we wrote all the microservices boilerplate from scratch and I was thinking that there must be a better way.. a few years later I found Nameko! 
You really should post questions in /r/learnpython. That's why you have few comments. Your left graph appears to be plotting counts against hand value. That is, your X and Y data look like this: x = [4, 5, 6, ...] y = [50, 110, 190, ...] You should be converting those counts to probabilities. Each "hand value" probability is computed from the number of occurrences of each hand divided by the total number of hands, ie, `sum(y)`.
Saaaaaame
You represent all of us sir
For anyone taking this article at face value, let me just add that if you want to do continuous deployment, you should strongly consider having more than just unit tests. I personally would not go with this kind of setup if all I had for the project was unit tests.
Assuming that you want a probability distribution, you can add `density=True` to your `plt.hist()` call.
`from collections import Counter` `def countALLlist(numbers):` `nums = dict(Counter(''.join(numbers)))` `answer = [0 for i in range(10)]` `for i in range(len(answer)):` `if str(i) in nums.keys():` `answer[i] = nums[str(i)]` `return answer`
Implementing our deep learning production model in PyTorch, then training it and setting up a microservice to deploy it on Kubernetes.
Actually I kind of think you are... If you can make a python list, you can pretty much get started with keras imo... It's really not as difficult as it's made out to be. Sure, the theory is a bit convoluted but in practise it's really not so difficult. Maybe play with matplotlib and get a bit of a feel for numpy and you should be golden to get started in keras (after reading up on some machine learning theory).
That's a bit low-level for python. Have a look here: http://raspberrycompote.blogspot.com/2012/12/low-level-graphics-on-raspberry-pi-part_9509.html?m=1

No mention of bors. I think for bigger projects, it’s definitely a good way to work! [https://bors.tech/](https://bors.tech/)
You could make an interesting project! How about a little raspberry pi, on upload of a file by the user, it sends the file to VirusTotal for analysis, returning a link of the analysis to view on the web. A silly project really but something fun I guess.
Those are king cobras.
He is going to struggle to leave that room
I was so hyped for some importance sampling
&gt; Everything prior to the 6.c release (December 2015) was considered to be a beta (or alpha) release. Non sequitur. Python3 is still in beta, judging by the rate of significant changes. Not to mention that, unlike Perl6, Python3 has no comprehensive language specifications so it's not going to ever reach that level of stability.
&gt; I was talking about the initial x.0 release. You were talking about a stable release, in an attempt to derail the discussion. No, stability is not relevant here.

Essentially every one I might require in the future :D Given your expertise with the whole topic, let me suggest another take on it: I assume you have the file as a vector graphics. Why not, on your own website within the marketing or contact us area, provide a widget where you can fill in the resolution on your own and download it (generated and then maybe cached raster version) then? Offering this service might even make the watermark superfluous as people would head your way? That'd be the dream of geometric design wallpapers. Stop thinking in resolutions to provide, but provide the wallpaper in the most flexible manner :)
This comment made me read it 
Good suggestion, however, for as long as we have a 5K version, it is not a vector graphic.
Ah, I didn't expect that but thanks! 
You really need to have a more holistic view of testing. Unit tests are your foundation. Don't rely on integration tests for everything or you'll find yourself with a slow build after a few years or less. This is all project // genre dependent, but for web based applications, generally, you should shoot for like 80% unit tests, 18% integration tests, and 2% (or less) end to end / UI tests. Good video on the topic. Don't make the mistake of skipping unit tests! https://youtu.be/RAxiiRPHS9k
I think it's an `=` sign that's just fuzzy in the screenshot; bad font rendering, or jpg artifacting or something.
I thought that too, but still wanted to ask :) Thank you for your time!
That depends on where you work, if I was you I would check out job offers. I think you would be a valuable Django developer much, much sooner than data scientist or game developer, since you are familiar with rails. In my area (Berlin), data science positions very often require a Master's or even PhD in that field, that is also something you should consider.
Do you put the user submited code in any kind of sandbox? It's really easy to hack(or at least DOS) your platform otherwise.
There's at least other way which doesn't use `self=None`: class Builder: @staticmethod def stop(): # ... def _stop(self): # ... def __init__(self): self.stop = self._stop I thought about doing it this way, but I hate monkeypatching as a time-proven source of bugs.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
I usually have an ipython terminal open so I can test a data structure and some kind of algorithm out in real time.
Working on upgrading pyglet's internals to OpenGL 3+. It's mostly done, but need a bit of cleanup and some work on the default shaders. 
Not only is it relevant, it was my whole point.
Oh, yes, this is a lot worse IMO. Though \`self=None\` is better only if you are completely sure that you will not add any more parameters to that function. Else monkey patching is about the only way. Or you could write a decorator that looks if self is given and maybe replace it. That could lead to buggy behavior too though.
If they get 2 app names confused, wont they also get whether they're an instance or not also confused? I would say, either (a) look at the inspect module to perform reflection on the code, and find out who called it, or (b) wrap what you are doing in another api using the facade design pattern, and expose that to the user instead.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Post your code
I would still use Paraview for that. In Paraview you can use a PointDatasetInterpolator to interpolate from your experimental data points to the cell centers of your mesh and export the result as a .csv file. It is then pretty straight forward to transform this data to a profile file which can be read into fluent and used as a boundary condition. I use this method to transfer data between thermal simulations and CFD simulations. 
That is what I was going to suggest, a little bit more work but I think it’s more explicit with what he is trying to do.

Been working on my toy language project, Akilang, using Python and LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) The whole thing's basically an experiment to see how much of a language, and to what degree of success, I can implement by way of those tools. It's not Python that's the big obstacle; it's more my understanding (or lack thereof) of language implementation. I hit a major roadblock recently, involving the implementation of types in the language, so I'm backing up and rewriting a lot of things from the ground up. However, the current repository still works; it's just likely to be a developmental dead end. The next set of changes I make to it are likely to be extremely drastic. If you're on Windows, you can pull and try out Akilang right now, with some demos (e.g., Conway's Game Of Life). I'm also working on a "Robots" game demo, which is now playable. (Plans are on the table for supporting Linux; I'm just trying to focus on one problem at a time right now.)

You are demonstrating your ignorance of this problem domain.
No, I just graduated from where you are now. 
The ID probably is stored as int so you'd have to switch Datatype, and if you do that you might as well fix it altogether with new IDs (maybe autoincrement this time)
As has been Said: find a good application for OOP, I for example programmed a small crappy circuit analysis Framework because having different electrical components is so beautifully predetermined for inheritance etc.. I'm sure there are similar things in lots of other engineering-areas. Aside from stuff like this maybe you find something you can use personally (music Player with Qt and sqlalchemy comes to my mind right now because that's something I want to tackle eventually and both Qt as well as sqlalchemy heavily use oop) Generally working with or creating a Framework of some kind is great imo because the flexibility you want to put into it usually goes hand in hand with oop etc.
Initialize a counter with 1 and sort the keys, then peek into the next element. If it's the same as current, add a counter, increment it then repeat with next element. If next element is different, reset counter to 1. Keep doing it until the end of key list. 
That actually makes perfect sense since self is an object's reference to itself. The method name is in the namespace so you're effectively setting a default value for what would otherwise be an empty reference list if the method were called without an object reference.
&gt; it was my whole point Then your whole point was irrelevant. This discussion is about handling the core team's transition to a new language that looks very familiar to the old one but is incompatible in significant ways. Who cares if the new language even had a stable release? The process started when the new language was designed to be incompatible with the old one.
I like it! I also hate it because it shows how lazy and uninspired movie makers have become.
First off, thanks for working on and helping lead Jupyter. I use the IPython console everyday practically and use notebooks quite a bit as well (I'm actually using one for the task that lead to this rant). &gt;| Why?????? &gt; &gt;Because it make implementation code simpler. Yeah, that's kinda what I figured. That or the base algorithm that the code is based on matrix math (that's what the tensor reference in OP was referring to). &amp;#x200B; &gt; I'm not quite sure I follow what you mean here, but I'm not an expert on contour. See edit 3 to OP. I was using the functions in correctly by giving it a vector of initial values instead of a 2D array (as in the output of np.meshgrid), so it gave me an output of a 1D array. &amp;#x200B; &gt; I disagree here but I may be a matter of opinion/use case. Yes, very true. As I was trying to create an example in a GitHub request this morning I realized that the current method does make a good bit of sense for plotting data that is generated within the code itself (and I'm sure many other use cases as well). &amp;#x200B; &gt; Once you pass the angry/annoyed stage, try to write a **constructive** issue And that's why I posted on reddit first! lol &gt; Once you pass the angry/annoyed stage, try to write a constructive issue on the matplotlib tracker, explaining why such a function would be useful and the limited use case it would cover. At least asking an update of the documentation/example/gallery to explain why. As I mentioned before, in writing the issue, I kinda talked myself out of it. I might still make a matplotlib request for more explicit documentation as to the actual shape requirements and the "internal" format of the arrays or a "how is this supposed to work". I may make a numpy/scipy issue to request a function that can convert 2D array versions of X, Y, Z to 1D array of x, y, z. That's the issue I'm facing now. &amp;#x200B; Thanks again for your comment!
Trying to create my first dash-dashboard. &amp;#x200B; To do list: * Figure out how to create a layout, so 3 small tables next to each other, with a graph underneath. * Figure out how to host it to our internal network only * Figure out how to have the data refresh hourly.
You did not tell us what happens when you try to install it. Did you even try? What other python versions do you have on your system? What version is used when you do a pip install?
I only have python 3.6.5 installed and when i try to do pip install tensorflow it gives me: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for tensorflow
It would be nice to mention that you fetch data from https://fileinfo.com . Just to be fair.
Just played around a quick minute and wanted to stop and say that I love the refresh animation! Neat little project. : )
what do you mean by how long?
How long is it in meters?
I'm not sure if you're familiar with [hackathons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) but basically we have 36 hours to build anything with tech. When you submit projects, you simply give a demo to the judges so it can run on your own laptop. Therefore, to save time this is the least secure thing I could make - I mean my only form of authentication is saving the user-inputted username to their cookies. If I were to implement this for real use, I would have written this very differently.
**Hackathon** A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including subject-matter-experts, collaborate intensively on software projects.The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware with the goal of creating a functioning product by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I repeat: why do you feel it relevant to discuss your ideas about Perl commynity fragmentation here? 
didn't ask for that suggestion jerk off
Yeah, you're right
I am familiar with some of those words.
&gt; I repeat: why do you feel it relevant to discuss your ideas about Perl commynity fragmentation here? Because the same thing is happening in the Python community, obviously. Why do you pretend not to understand? Your own flair here is "Not turing complete", alluding to the lack of a tool able to automatically translate any Python2 code to Python3, so it's not like you're as naive as your questions would indicate.
I thought all of the reel utilities were written in python. Surely, there must be a base install so they can continue to use anaconda and such.
You are unfortunately misinterpreting my flair. It's just there to mock a fool living in the past. What's your excuse to pretend that python2 somehow still have relevance?

Try asking the folks on the r/learnpython subreddit. They’ll probably have the answer for you. 
The good people over on r/learnpython will probably have the answers you’re looking for. 
FTA: &gt; In order to improve this experience for RHEL8 users, we have moved the Python used by the system “off to the side”. Reading the thing they linked there, and the rest of the article, it appears that what they did was refuse to ship anything at `/usr/bin/python`, for the reasons described in the article. System utilities that need Python know where it actually lives, and if you absolutely have to have bare `python` (as opposed to `python2` or `python3`) work, you can make it work, but they want you to avoid doing that.
You have a semicolon and not a colon at the end of line 6
You have a semi colon “ ; ” instead of a colon “ : ” after the while loop. But what do I know I’m new to Python.

They explain it in the article. There is an internal python implementation used by their built-in tools, but it is kept isolated from the rest of the system. The user-facing python implementation can be chosen independently of the internal version.
What's strange to me is that, when the movie is not found, it redirects to `/return false`. For example: `https://movies.iwoaf.com/return%20false;?q=test`
Nice work 
Remember, collecting article links is now the real goal.
&gt; I think Zed realized the fools errand he was on Wait, you mean a professional programmer like yourself can't write a program to translate any Python2 source code to Python3? I'm very disappointed... &gt; Which part of the Tauthon project have you contributed to, btw? Oh, you know, the usual: porting new Python2 versions to Tauthon, enabling PGO for extensions, fixing the Windows build, etc. - https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Astefantalpalaru+repo%3Anaftaliharris%2Ftauthon&amp;type=Issues &gt; You know, that project with all of the brouhaha, that somehow never seemed to get traction proportional with the number of lines of legacy code. Of course I know. I'm an actual programmer, not a simple member of the peanut gallery.
How can you ever expect to be a real developer, without a reddit account that has a million articles for every language saved?
Working on a Twitch chat bot. It will let players play Rock Paper Scissors with each other. Maybe in a tournament style too.
It appears that your faith in the future of Python2 faded out about half a year ago. When not even you and your mighty steed Rosinante can turn that tide, I see no point in spending my effort on that fool's errand. 
That is really, really nice way of representing the embeddings ! I'll definitely check that. Thanks mate!
But my feet are wet
A bit too late, but still: You can also do that with Pandas. Hell, I've used Pandas for almost the same use case too (reading CSVs, minor cleanup, then inserting it into a database). Pandas has a lot of analytical capabilities, but you don't have to use them. Even if you don't, you'll get a high-performance table abstraction with a lot of input/output capabilities built in. 
It’s interesting that the Benjamin Button example consistently placed male faces on the left and female faces on the right as per the example. That seems to suggest that you might be able to make the model a bit more powerful in some ways by making it invariant to flips and rotations via consistently reorienting images in a consistent way beforehand.
Tried it out, this is actually a very nifty idea and I like it, so well done on the creativity and the work you put in. Some ideas for you to throw around with (bear in mind this is issues we've got at our company when it comes to finding elements, so other people's problems might be different): 1. A lot of times our struggle comes in on the load of the page and having to wait with the different expected conditions (i.e. is visible, is clickable etc.) an idea for extra functionality perhaps? enable us to force a reload and to see which expected conditions is quickest? 2. This goes along with #1, we struggle to find elements that's happy across browsers (i.e. an element 'clickable' on chrome might not be clickable on Edge), if you could have the tool check across all major browsers at once. That'll be a huge help. Again, very cool idea! &amp;#x200B;
Good question! Well, I removed the .py extension because I wanted this script to be used from anywhere on the computer. What I mean with that is, when you install the script using pip, it will let you run it my just typing the name of the script. Like this: `fileinfo` So if I added the the .py exntension, you would have to type [`fileinfo.py`](https://fileinfo.py) in order to run the script. &amp;#x200B; I hope you kinda understand. But please do ask if there is anything you dont understand :)
Building my first python gui with pyqt4. Project DeskBuddy, RPi3B+, with 7 inch touchscreen, ir receiver, ir transmitter, webcam, 20x2 lcd screen, ir motion detector, temp sensor, mic, speakers and a couple of 5v relays to start pc and server remotely! Idea being is to have my 'deskbuddy' to show network notifications and other notifications, monitor network traffic, control my led light strips and my TV with IR, motion detector with picam to do facial recognition which autostarts my pc and server, I also plan to use Google API for calender and Google assistant. And hopefully after all that interface my android phone to the pi so it can control messaging and phone calls. Think of it as a modern car dashboard but bigger and better for your desk! 
You show the nice people over at /r/learnpython what you have written so far, and ask them for help furthering your goal. 
I learned about `abc.meta` through this and `__metaclass__` ... thanks.
I would store the data in a relational database and use a framework like flask to build my web front end. I might just build a REST api and use react for the front end if I needed it to be very dynamic. 
will do cheers

Why don't you ask your teacher again? 
helping my flatmate and it's 8.30pm so was just asking on here for help
lmao this sub needs to put a banner at the top for /r/learnpython - this happens at least once a day. People aren't reading the side bar. 
How did you deploy it? 
[avec ma bite et mon couteau](https://www.thelocal.fr/galleries/others/top-12-french-expressions-you-wont-learn-at-school/12) but more precisely with docker on a simple vps.

That is super cool!
Working on an arandom number generator (you read that correctly the first time 😉).
how does that work though? are pandas build on top of python types such as lists or is it an extension. Because how can it then be faster than a direct implementation in lists and dictionaries? 
now you acheived meta level
This... is amazing. Well done! Now my Plex collection is going to get better posters.
Good suggestion - [done](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28237955/same-name-for-classmethod-and-instancemethod/53508287#53508287)!
I didn’t think it was clear. Thanks for clarifying. 
Hey thanks for checking it out as well as for the feedback! These are great ideas. I especially like the multiple browser checking, that would be a real timesaver. I'm adding these into the roadmap. EHX will be updated this week, with more Selenium API options and optimizations. I will actually end up looking into that multiple browser thing because it sounds cool.
If you think that’s dirty, look at the ast, dis, and tokenizer modules.

I've made a GUI wrapper for youtube-dl over a few years. Learning GUI making, so just a hobby project, pretty much the only thing i do in python apart from a few scripts and other GUIs i made for myself. (As well as excluding some math and graphing for school reports) Got my first issue closed a few moments ago and wanted to say i'm actually happy someone tried my program and find it to actually work, which is the first person that i know of outside a few friends i managed to push it on. [Here's a link](https://github.com/Thomasedv/Grabber) if anyone is interested, i'd love for ideas for improvements or ~~beta testers~~ people willing to try it out and tell me how everything goes wrong. 
Yeah, no shit. I quit working in film cause it’s either a transformers movie, Star Wars or some old Disney classic turned life action. A friend of mine who works on a lot of the Disney movies refers to it as Disney incest. Couldn’t have put it better myself.
I love the click to explore feature. I tried it for a while and found that the horror direction kind of turns into a sinkhole you can't get back out of, until everything is black and red and made of fire. I got stuck on Gates of Darkness, which has enough similar posters to fill the similar posters pool so you can't escape it.
Still learning python, so my current project to build python skills is rewriting a program I wrote ages ago in Perl/CGI/MySQL (to upload, organise, query GPS track logs) with Python/Flask/Alchemy/SQLite. I just got it "live" (ie, uploads from my phone now go to the Python version rather than the Perl version) a few days ago ... so far, so good :-)
Good point ;-)
LOL. I can never stay on new reddit. Just click on the new reddit link and it loads the same old reddit I was already on. Occasionally, things change to new reddit when I load a page. Half an hour later, back to old reddit. It's silly.
Saw a post on /r/learnpython with a problem and wanted to try solve it. https://github.com/chillerno1/teambalancer/ Simply takes a list of 12 players, their position and skill rating and creates balanced teams (currently for Overwatch). Solved the initial task, but can see some cool improvements I can make.
I am working on my online Python development environment. https://peterpython.com Inspiration for the tools come mostly from Smalltalk - code browsers, transcript, inspectors, etc. The Python compiler generates bytecodes which are then interpreted in a custom Vm (written in JavaScript). This should allow for code stepping and inspection to be added over the next couple of weeks. 
Oh shit sorry

What a cool website! What was the hardest part with python?
Bloody awesome job!
do you precompute similarity between all images? or do you run some postgres extension that allows for fast hash comparison / preindexing, like pg_similarity https://github.com/eulerto/pg_similarity or the hamming distance one https://github.com/fake-name/pg-spgist_hamming . I believe phash is 64bytes by default so pg_spgist_hamming is a good match.
Good stuff, man. Thanks!
I was handed a project a couple of months ago, written in python. So, I had to learn python, then, luckily, I ran across your PySimpleGui first thing when it was time for an interface. What I expected to take weeks was done in about a day. Today, I'm working on how to populate a listbox dynamically but I don't expect any problems. This package simply kicks ass and I'm glad you were motivated enough to create it.
Push yourself to learn things you know little about. For example, you know machine learning libs? Make yourself learn Django. Start gluing ML and the web together in ways to make your life easier with RESTful services. Learn an ORM, or a graph database. Expand your base.
Well firstly it sounds like you have a permission issue, second you might have a namespace issue. 
The distress call is printing in each iteration of the for loop, make sure your indentation is appropriate
Thanks. What would be the advised solution?
&gt; I became obsessed with it over short periods of time then put it aside, over and over Sounds all too familiar lol.

This looks cool but very dangerous. Why automate the trading instead of providing alerts to notify you about companies that fit the profile for further analysis?
I'll give it a go and offer some feedback :)
As a counter, /r/learnprogramming has a sticky thread telling new people to read it first as was as links to an extensive FAQ in the sidebar and yet a large number of questions are asked each day which are answered in these locations. So I’m not sure it will eliminate the questions. Personally, I like the system of reporting the post and directing the poster to /r/LearnPython.
Django and Flask are jobs people need to fill. Web development is a great thing and it came fast to me and with your experience u should have no problem with it. I hope the best for u down the road.

Write a better IDLE or contribute to the code base. 
There are ways around context switching but the easiest with minimal setup is just to run the scripts from the terminal. For Linux and Mac I use: python script.py For Windows I use: python.exe script.py
 I appreciate your response, I am less than a week into trying to learn python and coding in general, so honestly I don't fully understand... I know the terminal is a separate window that runs the program but I'm not sure how to access it...

That just says the same idea began in math first. I guess it makes more sense when applied to morphism and graphs.
If I were to write such a program, I would start with a dictionary mapping letters to a six-digit binary code where the position of a 1 in the code is a dot... letters = { 'a': '100000', 'b': '110000', 'c': '100100', ..., 'z': '101011' } Convert the string to lower case, then loop through the dictionary replacing the letters... text.replace(key, letters[key]) If the key is currently 'a', the above command with replace every 'a' in the text at once rather than having to replace each one individually as would happen if you looped through the text letter-by-letter instead. If you want, you can then add the combinations... 'ch': '100001', 'sh': '100101', 'th': '100111' Put them at the front of the dictionary of letters and they will be replaced first. That would also be harder to accomplish if you looped through the text instead.
From the Python's standpoint, this is truly excellent post. Thank you for the share, I'm planning to adapt some of the code. From investment standpoint however, there is a contradiction. You explicitly state that the goal of Graham's strategy is not "double your money in a month", as you put it, but to achieve steady portfolio growth. Adding automatic trading into the code would likely result in working against it - you will end up not holding any individual stock for a prolonged period. I would remove the auto trading and instead introduced additional calculation that would give a long-trend of the stock. How each stock rates from Grahams standpoint within its sector? Is this rating steady, or continuously slides down over the past X days/weeks? This quick summary would allow me to notice sliding stocks and act accordingly. 
Poe's Law strikes again!
There a bunch of overlap between math and cs. Like set theory for databases. 
You might be referring to the Wikipedia saying that Lisp programming language first introduce maplist which I believe is an implementation of [Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)), hence the word. But of course, I am also going by what Wikipedia is saying ... we might need a mathematician to explain this.
It has a math origin. A map is a function and by this I mean a mathematical function. Recall that a function in math is when a given value of x has only a singular value of y, that is, each x corresponds to a unique y value. This is exactly what map in computer science has is.

What is the Fourier transform approach? Where could I learn more about it?
What is an integration test?
I just bought a course on udemy for $10 with 24 hours of training videos. It has been pretty good so far. I am about a week into learning python as well. Let me know if you want more details I’ll race you... ;)
This Case, well any case where a getX() or setX() exists for a good reason. Property is a keyword in python
A test that includes services that aren't limited to the code you're writing. Example: a database, refis, etc
&gt; each x corresponds to a unique y value I think you mean "single y value" because mathematically, functions are defined with either one-to-one or one-to-many mappings. E.g., take a quadratic function
&gt;However it will failed most of the time (as for example if you slightly shift an image the distance with itself can be huge !!!). This in some cases can be addressed by mathematics. Sometimes it helps to get the square root of distances (square root of the sum of the squares). And then re-examine the results which are now linear. For instance imagine a cloud of objects that occur in a thick circle. One object sticks off to 3 O'Clock and another to 7 O'Clock and they don't seem simiar. But taking the SRSS will align the values according to their distance from the center. SRSS is gives us another perspective. 
It's simply generate all combinations of 2:2:2 teams, where flex will fill any role and return the result with the lowest MMR differential between teams. But I also added in some additional parameters you can tweak. For example you can set it so that DPS players are calculated at 105% of their MMR and supports are 95% - in the event you want to generate teams assuming that DPS players are more impactful than supports of similar rank and want to balance the teams appropriately.

That kind of stuff sounds like a full time job of many people! 
What about "x" * 42? Why wouldn't the same argument apply? "Diverge" is a smart-sounding word, but has very little to do with the surrounding context. That's not what types do.
You misunderstood the claim. A string multiplied by an integer will always give a string, so the types don't diverge as the values change.
&gt; 4.0/2.0 doesn't have an integer answer. It does, its result is 2.0 exactly, which is an integer.
You could consider a functional map as the action of mapping values to another container through some transformation function. Functional programming treat code as a series of mathematical functions. It fits the math definition in that you’re mapping elements from one container to another. That said, it seems more used to describe the mapping of a function over a range of elements, especially when you consider that it’s analogous to apply (as in apply this function to this container) in other languages.
Well, here's something even more interesting. As Python grows in popularity it attracts more and more of the less and less competent programmers. So, popularity is a... mixed blessing. And, in particular, it attracts people who have very little knowledge of history of the language and of other languages in general. Anyways, the modulo arithmetic for floats discussed below is kind of funny because... drum roll... it's not really exclusive to Python. In fact, I don't think Python core developers have anything to do with it on a conceptual level. As 99.99% of Python it is a copy-and-paste from some other, better, language. I don't really know the history of float modulo operations, but this nonsense existed way before Python. For example, C has `fmod()` procedure that does the same thing, more or less. However, I've heard all of this nonsense collectively called "Intel arithmetic", i.e. negative remainders for example, which also don't make sense in math were simply more convenient to implement in Intel's CPUs (probably they need less gates or something like that). Another possibility is that this comes as an unfortunate consequence of IEEE attempts to standardize its floating point, where they certainly went beyond what rational numbers would imply (NaNs and Infinities being just few obvious cases). Perhaps their aim was to make floats into "universal numbers", which can do everything any possible number (within high-school algebra program) could do... For instance, this made it possible for JavaScript to only use these kinds of numbers and... don't screw up so obviously and so often. Bottom line, I don't really know why this operation was added, but it was funny to watch Python fanboys try to come up with explanations.
I really don't like it when companies like this become patronizing and tell you how to do things "the right way". While Linux may suck in many technological aspects, ideologically, it's great. It's about doing what you want and not what someone else wants you to do. Also, notice how this crap always comes under the label of "improving user experience". Like, how Slack for example won't work in your browser if it's not Chrome or Firefox--they put a banner on their page claiming it's all for your own benefit, it improves your experience tenfold, if not more.
Yes, it is fairly trivial. The [discord](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) module will allow you to connect to Discord, and the [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) module will allow you to interact with a database. Beyond that, it's just pretty generic programming stuff.
Very clean, looks good. Thanks for making this and sharing. 
it is precomputed, a huge NxN distance matrice is computed and I only keep the 6th highest elements for each row. Thank you for the link, i didn't know any of them and it might result in a way more elegant solution.
Thank you but I know FFT. I don't know how it is applied to this problem.
Thanks a lot man :)

Thanks bro that's what it was, apparently my phone keyboard is not the best
It relates to the quote you posted. There's no experience improvement involved here. At least not for me. Quite the contrary, it will make my life more difficult, because now I need to write more "inventive" code to make things work more or less the same in different Linux distributions. It arguably improves life for idiots, like typical Python/Django monkeys, but even for them, I expect there will be more surprise and buthurt about not finding any Python, than happiness about having to deal with multiple Pythons. The real problem that RHEL were trying to solve is that Python has one of the worst package management systems around, and idiots would too often and too easily break their own system to the point where they didn't know how to repair it because of how Python packaging works. So, instead of coming up with the real solution to the problem: either making their own packaging for Python, or ditching Python altogether, they applied "a quick patch", that didn't really solve the problem, but made it even less likely to be ever solved by reducing the chance of some very undesirable consequences (but not eliminating them entirely).
As someone who was just as recently as yesterday defending the questions... Once a day? Since I actually started paying attention (yesterday, mind you), it's unfathomable how many times a day simple questions like "how do I print a string to console guys?" gets posted =/
I've used pybind11 to wrap a non-trivial C++ library (lots of templates, general weirdness). It's great because it is quite good at being easy to use for "easy" things, while still leaving you in charge to handle details if you need to. It is also very easy to make your interface "pythonic", e.g. by wrapping setFoo()/getFoo() methods into Python properties. What can bite you is probably how it handles memory and object life cycles, so be sure to check out the documentation and examples. If your project is not doing anything funny, then I don't think you will have many problems. Good luck!
It takes the first letter from `s`, and places it in front of the rest of `s`, _reversed_ (this is where the recursion happens!). So `"hello"` becomes `reverse("ello") + "h"`, which then becomes `reverse("llo") + "e" + "h"` and so on until `reverse("") + "o" + "l" + "l" + "e" + "h"`, at which point `reverse("")` becomes just `""` (see the first base case). Also, /r/learnpython is a better place for questions like these.
Notice that it's not just `s[1:] + s[0]`, it's `reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]`. That means: - `reverse('hello')` calls `reverse('ello')` and then adds the `'h'`, - `reverse('ello')` calls `reverse('llo')` and then adds the `'e'`, - `reverse('llo')` calls `reverse('lo')` and then adds the `'l'`, - `reverse('lo')` calls `reverse('o')` and then adds the `'l'`, - `reverse('o')` calls `reverse('')` and then adds the `'o'`, - `reverse('')` returns `''` because `len('') == 0`. This is the idea of recursion - if applying the whole operation in one shot (i.e. with a loop) is too complex, the function just takes a small piece of the problem and then calls itself to take another piece, which calls itself again, and so on until the problem is small enough to solve (in this case the string is empty). Now, going back up the call stack, - the `reverse('o')` recieves `''` from `reverse('')`, adds the `'o'` it pulled off earlier and returns `'o'`. - the `reverse('lo')` recieves `'o'` from `reverse('o')`, adds the `'l'` it pulled off earlier and returns `'ol'`. - the `reverse('llo')` recieves `'ol'` from `reverse('lo')`, adds the `'l'` it pulled off earlier and returns `'oll'`. - the `reverse('ello')` recieves `'oll'` from `reverse('llo')`, adds the `'e'` it pulled off earlier and returns `'olle'`. - the `reverse('hello')` recieves `'olle'` from `reverse('ello')`, adds the `'h'` it pulled off earlier and returns `'olleh'`.
&gt;There's no experience improvement involved here. Yes there is.
&gt; Also, /r/learnpython is a better place for questions like these. Ah, sorry. Didn't know about this. Thanks for the answer. :)
And I thought time zones were fucked up.
What do you mean, there’s no “abstract” decorator..? `abc.abstractmethod` is a decorator for this exact purpose and it’s even in the article..? Or are you talking about something else here?
Because then it has to resolve the call to reverse('ello')
In order to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
Sorry. Maybe "how it applies here" would be a way to put the question then, rather than "what is it?" I see many papers that refer to using Fourier transforms in image matching just from typing "image matching based on Fourier transform" into Google. However, as mentioned earlier, there are some simple mathematical tools to apply like SRSS. There is one paper that does use a Fourier transform, but also employs a feature vector and more simple math transforms (log-polar in this case): &gt;The descriptor is based on the Log-Polar Transform followed by a Fourier Transform and selection of the magnitude spectrum components. Selecting different frequency components allows optimizing for image patterns specific for a particular application. In addition, by relying only on coordinates of the found features and (optionally) feature sizes our descriptor is completely detector independent. We propose 48- or 56-long feature vectors that potentially can be shortened even further depending on the application. Shorter feature vectors result in better memory usage and faster matching. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188496 Hth.

When you say "12 signals" do you mean "12 channels"?
props for using unittest. never been a fan of pytest... not really. but what's with the comments? are you leaving a failing test in there on purpose to achieve higher coverage??? seems to contradict the point of measuring coverage if you just do stuff like this so your coverage is higher but you aren't really testing anything valuable. *report\_activity returns None! yay! who cares what it actually does!!*
A recursive joke about recursion. Nicely done.
Currently the method is not implemented. It just returns `None` via a `pass` statement. Once it is implemented, it should fail if it's not implemented with a unit test. That stub of a test insure that it wont be added absentmindedly with the tests forgotten about. It's a pattern that's worked well for me before in... less than diligent teams. 
I think it's wonderful. It is much easier to work with if changing the C++ library is an option and you're working with C++11. If you can't change the library some things can get tricky. So you should be fine. Code I wrote with pybind11 has been running in production for a few months now with no complaints from the client. I tried Cython and Swig too. Had stability problems with Cython that I thought were intractable. Swig is a PITA. You do need to read its code at times and have a good mental for the interaction between C++ and Python. The community on gitter is helpful. There's some active members who are usually willing to help. Its creator is a Swiss university professor who uses it in his research so it is not going away. At the same time he doesn't have much time to work on it so updates are slow lately. There's two lieutenants who help too, who are also busy. That's a problem at the moment but what is there works well. 
It's neato, I see several usefully commands I'll add to my own self management bot project. Veo que eres argentino así que te lo digo en español, está muy guapo el bot sigue así!
Weirdly enough that's an optimization I was looking into today for my test's setups/teardowns and I got a crash course on requests. It's beautiful how well it all works. Really love python! And I did implement the Page factory design, really made it all very simple. Reason why I'm so much more in favor of Python is that Java feels so clunky with all this harnessing and stuff that needs to be done before anything actually works
It is a bot that runs on Telegram and responds to the /commands listed in the Readme. OP created it for his own educational purposes, and he plans to add more capabilities to it as he continues to learn. He hopes that you too might find something educational within it.
No, 12 signals in the channel
How is it working? Do you have demo video? Is it only for jupyter notebooks, only for python? Is it commercial or paid? Are you going to have jobs board, or portfolio to job matching (based on some machine learning algorithm of course)?
Struggling to get a diffraction pattern to work.
Ahahaha i belive you, is like: Signal : 1 6 6 7 9 5 4 3 9 6 5 3 4 4 7 By 12 signals I mean like : 1 6 6 7 9 5 4 3 9 6 5 3
&gt;Your bad taste is urgent wtf does this even mean? You're asking for help, and insulting us at the same time. I'm out. Good luck with your homework.

Thanks for the comment! Yes for now it is only for jupyter notebooks. Right now it is all free! We are planning on building a jobs board/portfolio platform, of course using ML :) If you had a magic wand what would you change or add to the platform?
Thanks for the comment! We want to distinguish by the other platforms by making it the platform for skill development, portfolio creator and job matching. If you had a magic wand what would you change or add to the platform?

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster.

My guess is that you're looking at modules that use async I/O in some capacity, and `asyncio` was only added in 3.4.
It could also be the copulative issues with unicode strings, an marking of such fluctuating a bit.
/r/learnpython Single backticks for inline code snippets. Four spaces in front of each line, or triple backticks above and below, for multiline snippets. You probably have multiple versions of python installed. Exactly how you do it depends on your OS, but on linux, for example, the command `which python` and `which pip` will tell you where the program is coming from - make sure it's the right one. I would recommend not bothering to get too comfortable on anaconda navigator. It's often much more clear what's going on if you use the command line, which is just `conda install &lt;packagename&gt;` (`which conda` to make sure it's the right conda!). 
It's a functional programming convention to call the Functor morphism `map`, which python has borrowed. It's a bit of a misuse of the name, actually, since it only implements a specific functor instead of abstracting over an interface. 
thanks for a prompt reply. i am on windows 10
Looks like it might be `get-command`, on Powershell? Although you'll probably find a lot of tutorials are geared towards linux, in which case using a [linux (ubuntu) terminal on windows](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0) might be easier.
While I don’t have any specific recommendations [here](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md) is a link to a list of free online e-books not only for python. The amount of books it has for python is huge!
Do you speak German?
Python crash course Automate the boring stuff Fluent python
Another way to not worry about the GIL so much is to use [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html). They basically reabstract the GIL "back into userland" so that we're always in a single thread that is an event loop being interrupted by futures (the pythonic version of promises). So in modern python you'd be using this for I/O-bound tasks (hence, _asyncio_) in conjunction with multiprocessing workers for cpu-bound tasks.
Would you be interested in candidates outside of EU/EEA?
Greatm That is quite informative, thanks!
Hi, thanks for the input! I expect that there is a lot of room for improvement in this method. As I said over in /r/algotrading, this post wasn't so much about tuning the results for performance as it was about getting people interested. (In the article, I suggested that people do their own testing before they commit their money to anyone else's script, including my own.) Later, I hope to have an opportunity to write an article about using historical data for backtesting a similar strategy, and it very well may be true that adjusting the strategy for determining the holding period would improve performance beyond a recalculation once every few months as it does now. I'll try to explore that; thank you for the suggestion!
Any sort of trading has risk, of course. Some people prefer to automate their portfolio because it helps them forget about it. (For most people, interfering with a strategy with panic selling or something of that nature is going to hurt performance.) This is, in a lot of ways, similar to ETFs, and those are quite popular. However, there are a lot of "scanners" that do as you suggest, and a lot of people do use them. With a live trading algorithm, though, you exchange the possibility of human error for a strict adherence to the strategy. What investment strategy works best is something I can't decide for anyone else, but this is an example that hopefully shows people another way to go about it.
If I were to suggest a single feature, it would be a feature that allows you to create runnable code cells within an article. I could see running someone’s code and tinkering really support my learning. To be honest, I do this with most technical articles by grabbing the source code and running it locally. You’ve mentioned in another comment that you plan on implementing a job matching function. As wider questions for you as a business, what are the no# of people in tech that acquire roles via social and what sites play the biggest role? My resume uses my GitHub and my personal website, what are the most common tech sites on resumes and which are you trying to replace? Nonetheless, great job and keep working on it – the idea could be a great community tool!
This is really useful. Thanks! Btw the changelog shows updates in Sept 2018 and Apr 2018. Both seem like fairly large updates. That seems fairly frequent to me for something like this. And if the main dev is a prof then I'd even say that's quite impressive. Still trying to guage the longevity of the project. But seems to have been in constant active development since 2015 so that seems like a good sign.
Thanks i'll try to improve it with setup instructions and a small example of use
I’m learning python!
Automate the Boring Stuff is a really good introduction to the basics and gives you a ton of useful projects to use and grow with. And it's also available free online, and with a udemy course from the author that's pretty cheap.
Very good work, it's great. I've also been very interested in the organization of your bot, it's very well organized
Nice work ! I want to start a similar project but just for movies in the city, would you suggest some documentation you used for the bot and all the rest? I once made a bot for BTCUSD prices but it was reaaally basic. &amp;#x200B;
Incubation period of the Python 3.x line. Of historical importance for helping it get to the point where it can start seriously replacing 2.7.
Sweet. Have already started on it...Thanks for adding to the community !!
Cool 
I'll definitely check this out. Have been interested to learn about how networking works and using it to make something.

Commands should be in English language(international language), if you want people across all the world to use your bot. 
That's a good point. I was struggling to find a way to assert that it was still just passing. I guess this is better than nothing, but if you have another idea I'd love a suggestion. 
Haha, nah I don't think it's worth the effort... I'm sure here in Python land you can hack it to do anything if you wanted to badly enough
I'm not sure what you're asking for here. Help on creating a Quidd bot, slaves so you can take credit later, or help on a bot to spam the Google Play Store? Either way, shady as fuck.

It looks like your first programming language is Java. It's not very pythonic. Your handling of days of the week can be better. If you are creating the days of the week then you're doing it wrong. [https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/hoypido/utils.py#L17](https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/hoypido/utils.py#L17) It should be changed to use the calendar module. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.day\_name](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.day_name) I know what you are thinking... the day names are all in english. That's not true. They are locale aware. See the documentation for the locale module if the names are wrong. Here's some style feedback: [https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/hoypido/utils.py#L47](https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/hoypido/utils.py#L47) That's a bad way to search through a dictionary. Use dict.get(item) if you want to get something without using a try/except block. It's much easier to follow. Also your function will always fail if you check on Sunday as there will never be a 7 key in your dictionary. Try calculating the next day ([datetime.now](https://datetime.now)() + timedelta(days=1)) instead of just adding 1 to the "day in week" number. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/feriados/utils.py#L20](https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot/blob/master/commands/feriados/utils.py#L20) Hard coded html is usually to be avoided. Especially if you want your code to be usable by someone else. Rarely can people use someone else's html off the shelf. I'd recommend you use a templating library such as Cheetah, or Chameleon. And again, if you have to enumerate or create something that almost everyone on the planet knows, that's a smell. The calendar module knows the names of the months and will gladly present them in whatever language you use.
Hey, I have a similar project except it runs on GroupMe. I think you might be interested in how we load all the responses- rather than having to one by one load the files, every response is a subclass of a generic main one, then they are autoloaded in the main script. That way, adding a new type of response is just having the file in the right folder!

Sorry about that. Isn’t there a way I can create a script that’d read a .py file as text, and then parse for any numpy arrays, and then simply print their shape?

I was googling about this topic today, thanks. you got a new subscriber :)
Why don't you like pytest?
I think until 3.4 all the 3.x branch didn't get a back from the community. 3.4 was the first "not totally broken" version that mainstream library started to adopt.
Too much magic. Very difficult to read the pytest source code and understand how it’s working (rewriting assertions and such). That said I haven’t been working in python for a year now.
Too much magic
Thanks :)
Glad to know I could help out.
There are JIT compilers for Python as well as compilers to generate native executable code. If Python was "too slow", the scientific community wouldn't be using it as their bread &amp; butter. Python &amp; its visualization capabilties have transformed data science. Python was used in the discovery of Gravitational Waves, which led to a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017. 
`/barrio` `NullPointerException` JA
Yeah, you have a point. And, I actually did use Pytest on my last major python project. It was a learning experience for me. I had a lot of hurdles to jump through in order to do things that were simple in unittest, but that’s part of learning anything new. Colors are beautiful. The javascript guys really impressed me with their “yarn” package manager, it’s so much prettier than what I’ve been used to for years. I guess that’s bleeding over to us now with pipenv. Pytest-sugar is nice. I really liked organizing things in classes for multiple reasons, and setup code is one of them. Multiple tests sharing similar setup code achieve this with fixtures in pytest, but that just feels like a hacky solution for people who prefer function-based programming and don’t like classes / state or whatever. They are both good solutions and the most important thing is that the code is tested smartly, not which framework is used to test them - although some may find one approach more maintainable or readable than the other.
Great stuff fellas would love to work on this project with you both...... is this still running/will it work for this weeek? Going to fork this and start making my own adjustments 
&gt;nd shortcuts that won't work in any other language List comprehensions are in many functional languages. They were around before Python. Python adopted them as an elegant syntax for iteration
You can actually group your tests in a classes with pytest. But otherwise I totally agree with what you said: &gt;They are both good solutions and the most important thing is that the code is tested smartly, not which framework is used to test them - although some may find one approach more maintainable or readable than the other. That's really what matters. 
Man, this is some threadromancy: &gt; If Python was "too slow", the scientific community wouldn't be using it as their bread &amp; butter. Python &amp; its visualization capabilties have transformed data science. Python was used in the discovery of Gravitational Waves, which led to a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017. This doesn't really address what's "slow" about python" and what makes those modules work. The underlying platforms for data analysis are really just python interfaces for a c utility. This is the case for pandas, matlab, ect. &gt; There are JIT compilers for Python as well as compilers to generate native executable code. C compiled python as others have pointed out isn't really python as a language anymore. It's an interface. Even then it's going to be far slower than native C or C# because of the interface. The reason python is slow is because: 1. It's a interpreted language, which will always be slower 2. It's a dynamic typed language, which is always going to be slower ([see vs java](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/python.html) Python is a great language. It's easy to use. But a lot of that ease of use is made at a sacrifice for raw performance.
Go into your antivirus and allow spyder.
No language/tool is a hammer for every nail
In general it's just maturity. Although to be honest, it's [Python 3.3](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html) that's a key milestone. That allowed u'unicode' for strings again, which made making code that worked in both Python 2 and 3 much easier. 3.4 doesn't have any huge changes like this, but OTOH it was the first version of Python 3 that a lot of people started thinking was suitable for production work.
when I allow Spyder it adds Python.exe instead, but the issue still persists unless I disable "Realtime Shield"
Interesting. Would love to go through this, an added bonus would be if you can go deeper into Network programming. Probably a bit of IP layer and data link layer using something like OpenFlow would be an interesting watch. Bookmarked your videos!
Wuy is done for that https://github.com/manatlan/wuy
I dont see why when you allow one thing it would allow another instead. Are you sure you didnt misclick. Have a look at quarantine if it has something like that and see what is being blocked. Also google the issue and see what that outputs. They might have a solution offhand.

Awesome!
Thinking you can beat full time algorithmic traders with a script based on one person's strange interpretation of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor that trades more often using quarterly reports rather than using a buy and hold strategy, running unmonitored just seems like the hight of hubris.

I was just wrong, and misread.
You're making so little sense I'm going to assume you're trolling.
If asyncio is important for your work you'd probably [want Python 3.5.3 or newer](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#why-is-python-3-5-3-the-lowest-supported-version).
Web2Py is probably easiest full one. Then Django if you want more power and complexity that comes with it. Flask is bit minimalist but nice if you want to do stuff by hand. Masonite no experience with. 
Easiest in terms of learning general principles? I will definitely check it out. 
Yes. I start with a basic of networking section for that. You do need a basic understanding of Python though. What are variables and functions etc.
Sounds good!
Nvm, I figured it out.

I'm working on pure-python PyGame tutorials which use Python 3 native enhancements.
No I have not. Unfortunately I don't have linux or any experience at all with it. I made my program with only Windows in mind, and so there will probably be some path issues I'd not a crash on that end depending on how path works in linux, as well as probably visual problems since i made the stylesheet only from what I could see and figure out with some experimenting. I am only creating executables for Windows, and I don't even know how to make the equivalent on Linux. 
ok, i'll try to compile it even if don't have experience with pyqt and maybe some pull requets to add support for linux
The way people explain is really different. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Do tell me how it goes. Hopefully my code is structured and set up in such a way that it's not too hard to make work on multiple platforms. Do reach out to me if you have any problems, I could at the very least try to explain some decisions I've made in my code writing. 
Not here to do your homework. Also, /r/learnpython.
Truth be told, in many years I haven't been in a situation where the company I worked for asked for RH support. We submitted patches (in particular to NFS client) and few other packages. The last company I worked for had its product require CentOS as deployment platform (i.e. think about many thousands of VMs with CentOS doing all sorts of stuff). I don't think that had support being needed, it would've been an issue either in terms of paying for it or in terms of getting it in time and to the point. We even had a bunch of former RH employees in our company, who'd be able to find the right people, if there was a need. It's just so rare to ask for this kind of service, that I don't think there's much incentive for RH to screw things up on purpose. That's not how they make their profits. So, I don't believe they did it with the goal of extracting more support money. It's just a way to be lazy by applying a quick patch, where more fundamental solution is necessary.
Thanks, I knew I had seen it somewhere else. I prefer watching thenewboston but nice copypasta

Yes.
Don't pay for any books to learn programming. There are so many high quality free ones out there.
Ask your IT department. 
Wouldn't loading a web server lag an application? Well I guess it depends on the kind of application you're creating. That's why I'm a bit hesitant to use Electron for example.
Yeah I hear you. It’s a large company and I was hoping to not have to deal with submitting a ticket and such, especially if this becomes a more frequent need. 
It would be near impossible to get around security when implemented correctly. If you have a business case to convince them you need this, I doubt you will br denied. But with extra permissions comes great responsibility.

They saw relatively little use, and what they did see was largely by early adopters, and there was a fairly painless migration route, so there was no demand to keep them alive after they became end-of-life (unlike Python 2.7).
&gt; They're end of life Most packages have dropped 3.4 as well.
So you can already run Python? I've written simple schedulers in python before, something like. time.sleep() works, but remember, the parameter to sleep is a *target* and not an absolute - it blocks for *about* the requested number of seconds, but might block for more quite often (I don't *think* it blocks for less). Depending on your required scheduling accuracy, you might not find this works well for you. After a sleep, you have to check the time to find out for sure how long the sleep was (or how close you are to your target time) I have usually used a loop that would sleep for a fraction (like a quarter) of the required accuracy, or sleeping for half the remaining time until your trigger, up to a cut off point like 1 second. You want to make sure you spend *most* of your time sleeping to avoid a "busy wait", which will consume a lot of CPU. Hope that helps.
There is so much of this on YouTube for free, why pay?

A language version is EOL when the core developers announce that they will no longer fix bugs or security issues in that version. For CPython, this is known well in advance because the core developers commit to providing bugfixes for three years and security patches for five years. Occasionally this can be extended; for example Python 2.7 was given an additional five years of support because the transition was going slowly, but it's very rare and will probably never happen again. 
Hey OP how come you indian people are always there to save the rest of us plebs with your tuts?
The article looks for learning dynamic programming, but it will be very slow for longer sequences, and needlessly uses O(n^2) memory. This algorithm can be implemented using linear space using a smart trick. It is called Gotoh's algorithm.

3.3 was passable, but 3.4 made a lot of things easier. 3.4 also made it incredibly difficult to support 3.2 by being too friendly.
After my boss fighting with Visual Studio on Python 2.7, I told him about pybind11, which is a hell of a lot easier to use in Python 3. It's making our company finally switch to Python 3. It's a winner in my book for that fact alone.
The site looks great and the articles are well-written, but what's the "product"?
Ahh I see. Kind of an old issue there. Maybe I will give black a try, thanks.
black is less smart in producing a nice formatting, but it fixes everything violating PEP8.
Threads are getting buffed in python 3.8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0554/
Great list of resources! Thanks for the link! 
Turns out the Indian person is actuality there to copy the hard work of an American guy... 
You can check the [sched module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html) in the standard library.
Please can someone recommend me good tutorials on how to create bot.
I love the guide on webscraping. 
Probably going to be on udemy for less.
Issue with clear screen on other devices ;-; sorry. 
I want to understand what you mean. 
Working on a package to price inpatient hospital stays for Medicare patients by their diagnoses (a drg grouper for those in the know). It's going very slowly. 
El chiste original es mejor porque el bot esta en python. Ya programar en java es un chiste en si mismo
For learning, start with something barebones. Sanic and Tornado are great fun, as is Flask. &amp;#x200B; Django is a good place to go next, as it is widely popular and with good reason. It provides abstractions and tools you'd find yourself building from scratch if using a simpler/more minimal framework.
r/learnpython and read the sidebar
This sounds almost like you are looking for Electron (js - used for Atom editor) for or in Python. It seems it's possible to just use Electron with Python - though there's probably some cost there ([https://www.fyears.org/2017/02/electron-as-gui-of-python-apps-updated.html](https://www.fyears.org/2017/02/electron-as-gui-of-python-apps-updated.html)). &amp;#x200B; Electron ported to python might be a cool project...
Yeah, moist_opinion above seems to be a fake account too.
Python 3.0 (also called Python 3000) started 10+ years ago while 2.x was still in development. The work on 3.x continued together with 2.x. Initial versions of python were not as good until version 3.3 also in the mean time various changes were added to 3.x, similarly the 2.7 version was basically backporting features from 3.x.
PyQT or wxPython are both very good GUI frameworks
Thanks!
This is the first I've seen of this I think, so thanks for sharing!
PyCharm if you are serious serious, Jupyter if you just want to write and run some scripts.
Would you say PyCharm is hard to get the grasp of within a day or two?
It's also worth noting that when 3.0 started the current version was 2.5. Most of the features added to 2.6 and 2.7 (like context managers for example) were backports of new features being added to 3.0-3.3. Since 3.4 most of the new features haven't been added to 2.7 except perhaps by the community in the form of external modules (on PYPI, etc). This is because at that point 2.7 was to receive bugfixes only, not major features. When it got the 5 year extension, that was still for bugfixes only. 
It is a *very* feature-rich IDE. I use the professional version so maybe the free one is simpler? Even so, if you are unfamiliar having never worked with any IDE you will face a learning curve that will surely consume too much time fiddling with environments, project templates, configuration, etc. I would recommend Jupyter for sure to start out. Then when you graduate to PyCharm you will know it’s not your code that’s fucked up when your shit isn’t working b/c some environment variable is missing some wrong path in some one out of many directories you created by mistake when figuring out how to set up.
Thank you , I'm gonna try pycharm
What about Visual Studio I heard that's fast and it works good ?
This is extremely easy to work with. And there are like 35+ examples/demos on the GitHub repo you can take a look at.
I don't think you would really want a library which has that really one function; doing lower(), etc.
No, I just don’t read reddit often. The point I’m trying to make is- since it’s more than fast enough for millions of people who are doing great things with it, what are you doing wrong with it? 95% of the time it will be fast enough. When it’s not, you use an extension module. 
I just saw that it was a copy.. being an Indian brother to him, I'm really sad for his behaviour, but since I don't believe in blaming the entire ethnicity for a wrong deed of one person, I think he needs lessons on being a better human being. But I think I must see all of it and understand if he had added some things which went missing in original video... That would be really appreciable...
That's an editor not an IDE 
That really is bit much of a point: the very modules and uses you pointed to were not fast enough. Extensions into C are not python. As for 95%? Java and C still are more used than python by a 2x factor on the Tobie index. Python's speed issues is a large reason why. Python has limitation with large sets, multithreading, and a variety of issues. As you pointed out else where: it is not a hammer for every nail. Python's best use case is when speed is not an issue. When you can trade ease of use and upkeep for scaling and raw speed. 
This guy has the best truly beginner level python tutorials i have seen and he mentions a great simple graphics library as well. https://youtu.be/QQi_L7FUn7Q?list=PL3MK4J4ZjdEWfQQYievLW4Xb 
VSCode is an editor,but VS is an IDE,and maybe the best one in this universe
Whups, read one thing and thought of another. 
EOL is determined by the developers. It is, essentially, a support commitment. It's the same with operating systems or any other software. If a software is EOL in 'x' number of years, this means the developers are committing to support that software for those number of years. As a comparison, Ubuntu LTS releases have a 5 year EOL. This means that Ubuntu LTS releases are supported with patches and updates for 5 years, after which you need to upgrade to a newer version if you want to continue getting updates.
&gt;I could be lazy. This should be every programmer's goal.
Yet more spam concealed as a listicle :(
Anaconda was made for data science.
Pycharm 
use APScheduler 
Very nice! Is it oc?
