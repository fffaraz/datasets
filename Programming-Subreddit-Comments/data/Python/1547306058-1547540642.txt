I don't know how familiar you are with Python. But json data is pretty similar to Pythons dictionary objects. Python has an imbuild module for json, called json. I don't understand your request exactly, but if you want to filter articles based on words in a json data you can do that with Python.
How did you make that spinner??
The module is named `pymysql`, not `PyMySql`.
wow, thanks... The same problem was with 'import MySQLdb' ... Why do the docs say that I should use 'import PyMySQL' then
&gt; the docs say that I should use 'import PyMySQL' then Where?
I think you are pretty much a insecure person around here, the only reason I'm a tester is because I'm doing an apprenticeship on development, and my job role is testing. I want to learn python because it's a good scripting language, and it's also used in the cyber security industry? I said that one of my goal is that after I learn programming is actually to get paid for it too. I just asked for a few tips which way is the best of learning programming, no need to be an ass, . &amp;#x200B;
Conway's game of life: [https://github.com/Aperocky/conways-game-of-life/blob/master/glife.py](https://github.com/Aperocky/conways-game-of-life/blob/master/glife.py) Now this took me 2 hours to code but it's only 140 lines. So given previous code it should make a nice demo.

That's not the docs, that's a random article on tutorialspoint.
I made the code changes you suggested and I'm still getting the same error =/
What about this one? [https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/user\_guide.html#mysqldb](https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/user_guide.html#mysqldb) &amp;#x200B; import MySQLdb doesnt work import mysqldb works, but then throws error for some reason when trying to compile.
I bought the 1 dollar pack because of the openCV book. Did not like it, tho. Although it's a cookbook, I was hoping for way more explanations about the code than what I got.
I haven't tried Openxyl but I use XLSwriter because, in addition to everything else others are citing, it is integrated with Pandas. You can dump a dataframe (or multiple dataframes in my case) right into Excel (a trivial exercise) and then you can format it easily. The documentation is crystal clear with adequate examples ... you can learn basic operations in 15 minutes. 
`MySQLdb` should work, the package name is `mysqlclient`. What do you have installed? 
Check out this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22029635) basically iterate over |, /, -, \ while using cariage return('\r') to give the illusion of | spinning at a place. For the loading animation to spin while a process is underway, use multithreading 
thank you for the data. I will look into it.
Not sure what your project is OP, but consider using sqlite if possible. Python has some built in modules that are pretty easy and straightforward to use and sqlite is way less of a hassle to deal with than MySQL if you can help it. I saw this from personal experience. https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html

&gt; os.system() does not use fork(). `os.system()` is a very thin layer around `system(3)`, which the Linux man pages specifically document as: &gt; The `system()` library function uses `fork(2)` to create a child process So saying that `os.system()` does not *necessarily* call `fork(2)` is true, saying that it does not is false.
Ah, just curious. I had been using https://github.com/manrajgrover/halo when I've wanted a spinner 
Depends on what kind of game you want to make. Eve online (IIRC) is primarily Python - the 3d code is something else though. So all of the backend/server side is done in Python. Maybe stackless Python? It's been a while since I've checked. Anyway, you totally can make games in Python (and if you want 3d you could use pyglet). Pygame is popular for sdl (2d) programming in Python. Good luck!
https://i.imgur.com/rz6Qtct.png i installed pip mysqlclient, but only _mysql is working. Maybe it's because im using python 3?
If I was any less confrontational, I would have not made any comment at all. I stated facts about why the use of images are harmful. People don't like that, because "fuck the blind, fuck search engines, and fuck anyone wanting to copy and paste text, I want my shiny shit". I down-voted because I don't want to see more posts using images, and I explained why I down-voted, like we're supposed to (and not like the 50+ cowards who down-voted me without even a word). 
I cant use sqlite. If you have experience with mysql and python, maybe you could answer one question? Why does _mysql query return me (type bytes) instead of strings?
[FreeBSD uses vfork(2)](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/1d6e4247415d264485ee94b59fdbc12e0c566fd0/lib/libc/stdlib/system.c#L61) and [OSX uses posix_spawn(2)](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-1272.200.26/stdlib/FreeBSD/system.c.auto.html)
Could also pull the JSON data into a pandas dataframe for easy readability and slicing.
Maybe it returns False in case there is no connection?

If you see capital letters in a module for import it is probably built and named for Python2. I haven't gone and checked this up definitely myself. Though I think there was a standardization where modules built for Python3 need to be lowercased. I have problems with code written in Python2 that say "import Tkinter" because in pythong3 its noe "import tkinter". BeautitfulSoup became " bs4". there is probably a PEP somewhere about this being the preferred path God ng forward
Ill think about that!
Wait so I notable like ever note where you just take down notes?
Python isn’t really the best option as it is quite limited performance wise. I would suggest unity as it uses c# which is quite nice to use, plus it never hurts to know an additional language as a python programmer.
ClieNt
yea I fixed the spelling, ppl on discord told me to install discord.py plugin 
It depends on what the problem you’re talking about is, but from personal experience I can tell you that if you’re worried about it responding to itself, you may want to add another if statement below line 10(I think, I may have counted wrong but just below “async def on_message...”). This if statement should say something like “if message.author != client.server”. That’s the only issue I can foresee from here though.
&gt; i never programmed and want to get paid for it OP isn't asking for a job, he wants to learn and *then* get paid for it, just like the rest of us.
It may be (for your career overall, not for this internship specifically), although my far the best learning experience is through work, because then you can see how things actually shake out.
Can you walk me through what that does in vim?
So I switched back to VS Code the other day because of the issue on Package Control. VS Code has been running so smoothly.
You are already using `conda`, why do you want to use `pip` while you already have a better package manager? Just keep using `conda`...
You're importing from commands before you import commands. Seems backwards if not redundant.
Cool idea. I like how you have comments and your code is contained in nice little functions. **Some minor suggestions** inconsistent spacing near end with *pass* turn comments into docstrings, like so: def foo(): """ I describe what the function does """ don't be afraid of long function names - for example, photo is better called take_picture. Descriptive function names are good because they are self-documenting. 
I bought it exclusively for the Python for Finance and Investment videos and a little for the block chain ones (seems interesting to make one in Python not particularly interested otherwise.) I'm 4/5 of the way through the Investment one and it's given me a good place to start learning but beside that it's very meh. Realistically, with these bundles you'll never use all the materials, so if there's a few things you are interested in, it's not the end of the world if you buy it. At the very least you'll have some reference material or a starting point to learn more, even if it's not the best quality.
Is take_picture more correct than takePicture? I see both ways of naming functions. 
Yes, like evernote. At the moment I'm using [Joplin](https://joplin.cozic.net/), that uses Electron too. I like to take notes :)
ik it's something I want to learn in the future but atm I am still studying python :)
will do thanks!
Thanks!
You're right, there's a difference. I actually think repaying debt is even worse for motivation.
Do you think there is a demand in the market for this?
\&gt; She didn't pay me any money, didn't provide any incentives at all! Your whole story argues in favour of what I said.
&gt;But it's definitely tempered by the knowledge that it worked just fine for me. Great to hear that. Of course, motivation and education are complicated things. There's no universal answer to anything here. Generally speaking though, extrinsic motivators do not work long term.
I didn't know that you were looking to do something commercial, I thought it was for fun.
On behalf of r/unixporn, what is your colorscheme?
Well I am looking for something to test my skills with but if there is demand for these things can't you find some customers?
If you make a good product, you will always have customers. Regardless of the type of application you do.
As others have said the books aren't great, but you get what you pay for. I have used them as reference material and that has largely been fine.
Wow okay thanks I will check out these subreddits!
I'm only a beginner myself but I think something alone the lines of: frame.bind('&lt;Button-1&gt;', misclick) placed after your defs might work. I had trouble reformatting your code so couldn't test. You need to add 4 spaces to each line before posting code on here. You might want to learn how not to use import * as you will get told off here sooner or later for using it. Also look into not using globals. Don't worry most beginners do it. I went through same troubles not long ago and wrote about both on my blog, see my profile for link. 
Thanks will try that
Well, this is what it tells you: &gt; build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/src/twisted/test/raiser.o: file not recognized: file format not recognized see this: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=242682 seems like you have a mixed toolchain.
Easiest way is to use betfair's Api. Doing what you're doing bypasses the api, so it's fiddly to get working and will break if they change their site. 
Have you tried this? From the link I posted: &amp;#x200B; "If you already have Python installed, either add the directory containing python.exe to the system PATH in Windows, or use "Settings" &gt; "PATH / CLASSPATH" &gt; "Workspace" in jGRASP to add it for jGRASP only."
thanks. i'll remember these tips from now.

picked up a couple of bulbs over the holidays to start experimenting. Your post prompted me to do some quick digging - 30 seconds later I found this: https://github.com/adamkempenich/magichome-python - and a minute later I'm controlling all my new rgb lightstrips from a terminal. love it. 
in fairness, it also helps to sample everything in the medicine cabinet too :)

Never mind, I found the problem...a typo in the api key -.-. Thanks for your help anyway.
Seems to not duplicate when I test like this: example = set() example.add(1) example.add(2) example.add(3) print(example) {1, 2, 3} example.add(3) print(example) {1, 2, 3}
Use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/#example-pipenv-upgrade-workflow) and check for updates. Use https://libraries.io/ to email you when certain packages update (this isn't python specific). [Pyup.io](https://pyup.io/) is very similar. Start "watching" a github repo for "releases only".
Most commercial python games are RPGs using the renpy engine. Otherwise there is godot engine. 
/r/learnpython Sets cannot contain duplicates. It's not a case of whether `.add` removes them - the set cannot contain them. However, depending on what your element actually is, there might be times when something *looks* like a duplicate, but it's actually not. For example, if two objects have different hashes but the same string representation, you might print them and think "these look like the same object", but python thinks different. When you ask this question in the proper place, you need to tell them what the element is. Ideally you'd also post code for a minimal working example of your issue.
Pygame is not thread friendly, so it will keep doing its thing until the song is over. You'd need to make an applicable gui to bend it to your will. There's also pyopenal, it worked nicely for the "I press a button now you shut up" type thing. 
Yes, set- by and in itself- removes duplicates regardless of you use the add method or not. 
In windows, in the searchbar type cmd. Then click on cmd.exe. then type python(assuming you have it installed) and then you are using python command line. Is Linux and Mac. Open your terminal and then type python and you will be using the python command line.
Unintall anaconda, then install it again, check what happens. spyder comes pre-insalled with anaconda
`s=set()` `n=input().upper()` `for I in range(n):` `s.add(I)` `print(len(s))` what's wrong here if the output is country names like UK, France and else. It should not take duplicate inputs but it is taking duplicate inputs as well. Can you tell what's wrong here plz. &amp;#x200B;
Oooooor you turn on backtraces and you've found the problem in 1 minute instead of "several hours".
Good use of command line coloring!
I've done that and it still gives me the error. And I've checked in the file directory to make sure that the file that is missing is there, and it is so it's just not reading the file right.

Sorry Newbie me....
A few years ago I went through and compared all the Python Excel libraries. I ended up picking xlsxwriter, because: * it is the fastest * it supports LARGE files (thousands of sheets, millions of rows) * it has thorough formatting options * it is completely stand-alone
I am still on my daily python learning which I daily journal at [https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes](https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes) Recently had to process 2.5 GB size json at work, and learned about ijson library! That was fun. 
As expected, you read just what you wanted to read. My story establishes that I know that money is not needed for motivation via a first hand experience. My comment asks you whether the research you're basing your comment on is applicable to OP's case, and it points out that dads and teachers are different. 
Nice links, thanks.

I'm currently doing [this](https://youtu.be/zfvxp7PgQ6c) to make a Tetris clone using pygame. There's another [one](https://youtu.be/5tvER0MT14s) to make snake. I know some Python but wanted to learn pygame, and the Tetris one is really good.
"Best" is narrowly defined here as having all the features that I like, and none of the ones that I don't. Used here mainly as a form of clickbait. Huge thanks to [jnns](https://github.com/jnns) for writing the code for the font support, and then pestering me until I made a proper release 😃. If you're using python to turn random crap into ebooks, but regret that you don't have covers you could use for them, you may want to checkout [racovimge](https://github.com/anqxyr/racovimge).
&gt; When you ask this question in the proper place But anyway, what do you think `range` is doing, and why do you think it's doing that? Does your understanding of what `range` does square with the description of the `range` function in the documentation? Finally, why did you post this question to reddit before making the merest of attempts to debug this yourself? You printed the length of your set, but didn't think to check what it actually had inside it, when you saw that length wasn't what you expected.
Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here!
Ren'Py is a visual novel engine, so it isn't the best choice for RPGs in general. Fun fact: DDLC was made using Ren'Py.
I've never heard of this engine before reading this. I have only used pygame for my games. From what I understand python got supported from the 3.0 release and it says it got added as a script language for the engine. Can you make a game in this engine knowing only python or do you still need some C language aswell?
&gt;4 months ago Really?
A shuffle app that picks music based on the Fibonacci sequence. An app that charts the night sky based on your birthdate, month place and time, and an app that makes your phone a Bluetooth hotspot so you can send and receive messages in a emergency.
I am writing (rewriting, because I am using it already for work, but the code structure is a mess) a library to convert epubs to beautiful, beautiful LaTeX. This seems interesting.
I tried both the directory containing the file and the exe directly and still didn't work
I can't make a GUi. My entire project is based off of a single momentary button press to stop the sound. Thank you for Pyopenal though!
&gt;As expected, you read only the part you wanted to read. Or maybe we are having trouble communicating. It's not always 100% someone's fault.

You can do anything you need to in python, its great for micro services. At the end of the day python is just faster to code in, especially for beginners. Take up a few python projects to try and flesh out your skills, don't go to java unless you have to.
Regex is useful even outside the realm of programming. The major issues one finds themselves in, however, occur due to a variation in the underlying engine's feature set. If one learns PCRE they are more or less set, but they will still have issues translating some of their knowledge to another engine. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_regular_expression_engines 
Pipenv has a number of issues that make it disliked or unusable by a decent few, so obligatory mention of poetry.

No worries. Unity won’t go anywhere. If you want to stick with python maybe try Pygame to get your feet wet. Not the easiest thing to do but it’s nice to have done some low level development to really appreciate what an engine can do for you.
It doesn't sound like OP's goal is to educate his kid. It's to help him to realize that programming is fun.
If you only had a 6 faced fire and needed to generate a random integer between 1 and N with equal probability. Passing/setting interview questions. For the love of maths :-) 
I have tried that, it counts for both clicks and misclicks. not for just misclicks :(
Add —noconsole when you build the app
Put it directly after pyinstaller. It should work. Unless you are doing something like opening another thing in your code at launch. Also update pyinstaller.
This belongs on r/learnpython
For help r/learnpython is a better subreddit
read our sidebar then checkout r/learnpython and read their sidebar. Lots of information you're looking is already curated.
OP wants to make learning about programming fun. That's what good teachers do.
I wonder if this would trigger their anti-cheat plugin? If so, I’ll just have to teach him about randomizing your intervals between the auto building ;)
PyQt5
I don't think so. What OP wrote was: &gt;My hope is that he catches the bug. He's trying to awaken his son's interest in programming, not find engaging ways of teaching him programming.
Not me. My plate is PYTHN2 
not gonna lie, this post inspired me to go dig up some python and GO libs for some of the smart devices I own, and I spent a good 30 minutes last night giggling away making my lightbulbs react to ipython input. Stuff like this *is* what makes programming fun again, being able to recreate that first feeling of "I did a thing!" is magic.
Ok thanks!
Okay now this is an excellent idea. 1) Includes his passion 2) Uses simple string functions that “feel” puzzle-ish to a beginner 3) The API calls will help him understand it as a piece of many, larger cool things 4) AND It’s something that he can show-off to his friends, who will actually care and hopefully reinforce his sentiment. And if he builds something cool enough, he can create an OBS Studio plug-in to include it in his stream. Great idea, Sir!
That feel when you're a half mile over your warranty
PySide2
IKR, right?! I only wish I had an option like this over mowing yards for a week!
Spot on! And if it’s not fun for him, no worries.
Actually - He’s using his own Christmas money to buy it, but has to order with my Card. So he does owe me money. Which he can apt out and pay. But I hope he will be up for a challenge.
Some teachers just live it through and through. Very cool.

You need to avoid blocking calls like `time.sleep`; your entire program is blocked while that runs. For an appliance like this you should use an event loop. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20748326/pygame-waiting-the-user-to-keypress-a-key 
It depends on the kind of game. Making a roguelike with Python, for example, is very doable.

I think most python programmers are going to be much more affected performance wise by bad database usage. If your program, like a django webapp, relies heavily on mysql/postgres/mongo/whatever, those are the areas I almost always see bad performance code, and by far those queries are what dominate the time the app is spending. It's usually a logic issue with the way they decided to solve a problem, and what db hits it has to make to do it that way. For example, I'll see people in django iterate over a collection of objects and update and save each one in turn. Sometimes this can be as simple as changing it to `MyModel.objects.filter(some_query=something).update(field=new_value)`, but sometimes it gets more complex. But almost always, you can turn any db activity that happens one by one into a few bulk calls, bulk delete and bulk create and a lot of updates happening in an atomic transaction. A lot of the time it's stuff that's pretty difficult to convert but can end up with serious speed improvements. I end up writing a lot of code like this: through_model = MyModel.m2m_field.through mappings = through_model.objects.filter(mymodel_id__in=ids).values_list('mymodel_id', 'othermodel_id') other_model_ids = [x[1] for x in mappings] other_models = OtherModel.objects.filter(id__in=other_model_ids) ... You can get all the objects in bulk rather than going over each MyModel and querying for the OtherModel objects. This can be a huge increase in time if you end up running this for a lot of MyModel instances. The naive one-by-one solution is almost always the easiest to read and write, but unfortunately it can be like 100x slower than solutions doing it in bulk. i've seen 40x to 100x speed improvements making changes like this to the webapp I took over. It's not easy, but it works. Whenever you write a model instance method where it checks many2many relations on it or makes any other db query, consider whether you'll ever be iterating over a lot of these at once and running that function or whether you really only need to do this now and then for one instance. If it's the former, it's good to figure out a way to do it in bulk with minimal optimized queries. Knowing the nature of the db usage of your app is essential for attacking performance issues, especially for websites and anything else really that uses a db. I see developers write code in a logically correct way, but extremely slow compared to other less obvious ways of doing the same thing. Knowing SQL beyond the ORM helps a lot. On that note, a lot of bulk operations like `MyModel.objects.filter(...).update(...)` don't trigger model signals, so be VERY wary of model signals. It's really hard to make these optimizations if the django model signals are doing queries and their own logic and you have to convert all that as well. And signals that cause queries that cause other models to trigger signals can just be a cascading mess sometimes. I avoid signals like the plague for the most part.

Everything here is valid, your user input is now stored in inputString and can be used elsewhere in the program. Because it's a string you can change it to things like: print(inpuString*3) and it'll show the input three times in a row.

If you are calling something else after opening, it will use console for that second thing. Not sure if that can be avoided. It’s the second process using the console. Does your initial launch load the console or after you do something in it? It may be that other thing causing the console and —no console is actually working.

You got some out of place 2 space indentation in only one of the functions (inc_file_counter), the rest is fine. Also you may want to look into the .format() function as this doesn't look very Pythonic: print("Copied " + "'" + file_name + "'" + " to " + "'" + os.path.split(destination)[0].replace('/', '\\') + "\\" + file_name + "'"+ ".")
Actually looking at that line also reveals you should use os.path.join() not + to glue paths together.
Look at the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python. Also I think you may have some gotten some misinformation about python based on your comments about lack of Object Oriented and functional programming.

thank you, what are supposed to be ''Custom Headers'' ? I am reading the request functionality: If you want to add custom HTTP headers to a request, you must pass them through a dictionary to the headers parameter. Also this one: ''Making a Request When you ping a website or portal for information this is called making a request. That is exactly what the Requests library has been designed to do. To get a webpage you would do something like the following:'' In my case, I want to make a request to the betfair website but I don't know how to write the code. After I have taking the API and so on, how should I need to set my request? Any example with working with this library? Remember: I want it to see the result of a match and when there are the words ''2 set'' and a tennis player has ''1 tennis set won'' and we are near to the end of he game (you can understand this by looking at the score, so the program must scrape the result which is written in the website) it should automatically click the button of the graphic and to make a screen.. It's difficult.. it's seems impossible to me...

Thanks again though.. was nice to look in more detail and push my understanding forward a little bit
Yep
Sometimes other libraries "helpfully" rethrow an error for you with a "more helpful message". I didn't use Django much, but maybe it's the problem? Anyways, sometimes, if that's an error you know about, the information about the stack still exists at the time you catch it, so, you can pull out the stack frame that you need, examine its variables etc. In particular, if the error was rethrown by some very helpful library, it might be still available to you through this kind of introspection.
Tinybeans actually exists for this exact purpose. We were using Google Photos to share but it was too difficult for too many of our family members. With Tinybeans, we just add Grandma via email and she automatically gets daily emails of baby pictures. The app and website are great. People can comment, like, and reply with emoji - directly from the email if they want. We keep all the rights to everything. There is no compression so we can treat it as a backup as well, and offline archives of your photo journal are available. My wife and I really like Tinybeans and it keeps our son from growing up with 1000's or pictures already on Facebook and works for those without Facebook and/or Google accounts.

Basically, what this says is: "Python procedure calls suck, member lookup sucks, classes suck, the interpreter is implemented inefficiently" -- I can very much relate to that, but... why insist on using Python for something that needs to be fast? Python will never get there, and as it currently stands, the interpreter is only getting slower, more bloated, code is more and more difficult to parse. So, fighting for fast start-up times is an uphill battle. Fighting for faster method calls or member lookups is an uphill battle... And if you major competitor is writing its product in C, and is many orders of magnitude faster than you, what chance do you have? :/
I agree!

It will get you up and running with a *BASIC* blog website, but it is how I learned to work with flask and got started with my web app. It has been worked well with React on a project I have done with a friend of mine. &amp;#x200B; The above might be a good place to start, as it has been for me. 
Usually, if the error occurs in package code then the last call in your code in the stacktrace is the problem and you are not calling the package function correctly. Very occasionally, previous calls to the package code will set you up for a later failure.

By the way, here's something author of the article didn't mention, which also suck in Python, and is a fundamental part of it: instance creation times are too bad. Here's how I found it: I wrote a Protobuf parser (in C, with bindings for Python), both for binary encoding and for IDL. IDL beats the C++ version in terms of speed, but when the time came to benchmark the binary parsing it was... an order of magnitude slower. That was really surprising since my code looked like it did smarter memory management, almost no memory allocations during parsing etc... there was one place though, where it was creating Python objects, specifically, named tuples, since I assumed those would be the most lightweight datastructure to represent Protobuf messages. I dug deeper into C++ code to understand what was going on in its Python bindings, and realized that... they never created Python objects. They translated `__getattr__` and similar into calls that traversed the datastructure created in C++. And that alone gave them more than 10 times better speed than Python's named tuples.
Haha...........

You say "Correction" but the documentation doesn't contradict anything I say. In fact it supports it: the **only** language-wide promises it makes about the return result of `id` is that: - it is an integer; - it is unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Everything else is an implementation detail and *subject to change without notice*. That's how you know it can't be defined as a memory address, because in Jython and IronPython objects can move in memory. Other implementations, such as PyPy and even CPython, might someday get a memory manager which can move objects around. I called the result of `id` an "abstract ID number", when I could have been more precise and note that it is an integer. Although in fairness, who has ever heard of an ID number being represented by a fraction like 7/9 or a surd like √2? In context, it should have been obvious that an abstract ID number is going to be an integer. I also said that it was an accident if `id` returned a memory address. Of course I didn't mean "somebody tripped over, hit their head on the keyboard, and lo and behold, `id` returned a memory address". I meant an *accident of implementation* as opposed to a language design choice. If the language wanted to promise that `id` would return the object's address, they would have called the function `get_address` or something. &gt; So if you strictly will rely on some version of CPython and not just any flavor/version combo of Python, it is safe to say it is, and safe to treat it as, the memory address of the underlining PyObject. That's not what the docs say! They docs are clear that it is an *implementation detail* not a promise you can rely on. The whole point of something being implementation rather than interface is that it is subject to change without notice. You can rely on Python's sort being stable, as that is a language promise. You can't rely on it using insertsort for small lists and Timsort for longer ones, as that is pure implementation which may change at any time. (But probably won't.) You can rely on `id` returning a unique, constant integer, as that's the language promise, but you can't rely on it returning a memory address *even in CPython* as that's an implementation detail which could change at any time, even in a bug-fix release. (But it probably won't, unless CPython's memory manager becomes much more sophisticated.) The best you can do is say is "I know *this* version uses the memory address as the id". Even when you know that the specific version of Python you have uses the memory address as the ID number, what can you do with it? Nothing. You can't dereference the address or do pointer arithmetic , you can't [peek or poke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) that address, you can't take this address and get the object back. There's literally nothing you can do with this "address" in Python. (Note: I'm only talking about pure Python code. The C API and `ctypes` are different, of course, since they are specifically all about the interface between Python itself and the CPython internals. I don't know much about them, and I find it hard to believe that they don't supply a proper API for getting the address of an object instead of the "use `id`" hack.) 
**PEEK and POKE** In computing, PEEK and POKE are commands used in some high-level programming languages for accessing the contents of a specific memory cell referenced by its memory address. These commands are particularly associated with the BASIC programming language, though some other languages such as Pascal and COMAL, have these commands as well. These commands are comparable in their roles to pointers in the C language and some other programming languages. The PEEK and POKE commands were conceived in early personal computing systems to serve a variety of purposes, especially for modifying special memory-mapped hardware registers to control particular functions of the computer such as the input/output peripherals. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

In addition to what /u/marvin182 said, as being the most likely scenario for 99.9% of issues I've scene when importing. Do realize that some modules may actually still not work for hat way and will need a from import. I'm thinking of tkinter. I personally like to have thrmodule as part or the namespace so I "import tkinter" then use it to reference everything "tkinter.Dialog, tkinter.Message box, etc" But eith tkinter it is somehow designed with a submodule called "ttk", that essentially has newer versions of items above. However trying to use tkinter.ttk.Dialog or tkinter.ttk.Messagebox doesn't work. So you will often see both type of lines "import tkinter from tkinter import ttk"

I did not even know webstart.io. Cool service. I do not know anything comparable to this. Let‘s setup such a thing.
The beloved `requests` package by u/kennethreitz is known for having a good public API. This is because requests does a great job wrapping HTTP in a Pythonic way. Even if everything is complicated under the hood (as it is with networking), the user of the library is given a solid, clean interface which makes translating HTTP requests into Python function calls fairly straightforward. Another thing important for idiomatic APIs is meshing with the language rather than fighting it, which Python allows fairly well. Two good examples (specifically in regards to collections/containers) is both the builtin `collections` module and the `sortedcontainers` package. There are plenty of others. But Python's philosophy is that things should feel straightforward and simple when using them, at least for the target audience. Also, you might be interested in watching [Beyond PEP 8](https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M) by Raymond Hettinger. He talks about the best ways to wrap libraries to be Pythonic.

I now working on: sendurbottle.com and skyfolk.net, microblog and social Network.
Im intrigued that binaries have to be whitelisted, I've never heard of a work place doing this, Im supposing its a security thing, what problem does this solve in your environment?
Not a Camry! Those babies are rocks
In my experience, bulk inserts are worth fighting for. But, as with all such things... you need to measure to get the answer.
Thanks a lot for that, great material to dig in ;)
The other thing that is worth mentioning is that at some point in the future this might become a multiuser app (for now it is my tool and I use CLI to run it) Will your answer change then ? I guess saving with each finished process might have the disadvantage that will stress out the database I think you are right I will have to measure it. I will have to learn this and I hate to have to learn something while I am learning something else (digressing ?)

Are they talking about the cars 🤔
&gt; What drop-down menus? Stack trace is just a list of frame pointers... What list of frame pointers? Stack trace is just a bunch of lines printed to stderr...
&gt; sometimes my stack trace is just completely unhelpful, in that every line in the trace is something from the python packages, with like two lines from my code, and neither of them being the actual problem line. Define "the actual problem line". Do you mean that line that *causes* the bug (assuming it is a single line...) or the line that *triggers* the bug? The stack trace can't show you the cause of the problem. It can only show you where the problem manifested, the actual chain of calls that lead to the exception, and that's going to start with a line of your code. There isn't necessarily a direct connection between the code that sets up the conditions that lead to an error, and the code that runs into the error. That's what makes debugging so challenging. 
weren't* they :)
Your post is a little confusing, python can run system commands (bash / CMD) with the OS library, you can get the output quite easily and just use that string in your Django functions. I'm not sure where you're actually stuck? Also, read the god damn sidebar and go to r/learnpython Can you not tell just by looking at the posts here? This subreddit is for python related news and such, not for asking for help.
I guess menu isn't really the right word. Django has collapsible boxes underneath each line that are filled with local variables and such.
Love it! Thank you
&gt;Python Web Gui for network devices OOps moving it over thanks
Ah, I see, it's a question about the web interface that Django generates when you get an error... Idk, after seeing it, I didn't find it very useful, so I just look at what it prints to the console / server log and then connect to it with the `console.sh` or whatever it's called nowadays. I also remember there was a plugin for Django that you could use to debug template rendering and other UI issues, but I didn't really have to deal with UI, so I don't remember what it's called.
Looks interesting what sort of data sources can altair use? I have been playing with Seaborn and Bokeh which both do good charts from data frames https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html
In any case, my answer to performance-related questions in Python is invariable: use a better, or at least a decent language, which allows you to deal with performance questions in a non-pretend way. Any performance question about Python, especially if parallel execution pops up, is ultimately doomed to sound ridiculous. You will always be several orders of magnitude behind what your computer could do in principle, so why even bother? It's like trying to save some time on doing grocery shopping by flying to Mars, rather than Proxima Centauri. Sure, it'll be much closer, but you will still die of hunger on the way to grocery.
Brandon Rhodes has writing about this kind of thing https://python-patterns.guide/
FYI: pipenv uses a library called `safety`, which is published by pyup. You can just `pip install safety` and run `safety check` in a virtualenv or against a requirements file (by default, it checks security stuff only; if you have a pyup subscription and supply your key, it does a full check for outdated).
Somewhere underneath, there is a Prius. It is just that there is a whole different level of finish.
Isn't that more threading than asyncio? Asyncio, as a singlethreaded cooperative task scheduler, is like a single lane where one slow car backs everyone else up behind it.
You can ask anything about the technologies used!
Nah it really won't
Its really not lol. I drove one for a few years and its basically a prius inside
Wow, its really pleasent to look at. Nice design. Is it a templete or did you design from scratch?
Will you be releasing code for the site? Good work btw, have you been doing it long? 
Using bootstrap without pre-defined templates!
About 2 weeks in my free time. Yes! I'd like to upload the project code to GitHub when it's completely finished
Any plans for a write up? 
Yes, I'm preparing a small article about the whole development process (testing, deployment...)
I mean, my question is still about stack trace generally, because it's all the same info that you'd find in any of the consoles and logs. And the errors I often struggle with are generic python issues and not specific to django. My description was just referring (confusingly) to django's browser display of said information.
More like you leave your car at the shop and walk somewhere for lunch. No sense waiting on your car at the shop when you could be doing something useful while it's busy. It's single threaded because there's only one person, but that person has to wait for other things (auto repair, traffic, lunch preparation) and has the opportunity to switch context while waiting, like also commenting on Reddit while waiting on lunch while waiting on car repairs...
Wow, thats really nothing. I m also currently learning python basic+flask for about a month and cant design shit
Take it easy, when you have the bases of Python , you will be able to do impressive things!
You may have noticed that in the Python community, design patterns are not discussed as much. Here's an interesting Pycon talk about this. Only 20 mins long but it might provide a different perspective on the design patterns thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQFZrTDaQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQFZrTDaQ0)
Look out for PEP8
There are a number of excel libraries in pypi https://pypi.org/project/pyexcel/ 
Excellent analogy!
The [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) module will be your friend here. It's designed to handle dataframes, which are (approximately) tables. That means you can import and export to Excel with a single command, and very easily perform operations on the table. Pandas is a very powerful tool and extremely useful in many contexts, but it's pretty easy to walk in to the shallow end and bring in the more powerful methods as you need them.
&gt; If you're implementing a pattern, look to the language features. That is interesting and explains why most of the patterns I have learned and played with seemed so unnecessary and over-engineered in Python; there are features built into the language to allow you to achieve the same thing. 
Thank you very much!
Can you share the source?
Too bad that's all they are
No they're still discontinued 
I can but there really isn't much to it... #!/usr/bin/env python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from wordcloud import WordCloud import praw text = '' def get_reddit_content(text): reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id='blah', client_secret='blah', user_agent='blah') a = 0 for submission in reddit.subreddit('all').hot(limit=100): print(a) text += submission.title for comment in submission.comments: try: text += comment.body except AttributeError: pass a += 1 return text text = get_reddit_content(text) wordcloud = WordCloud().generate(str(text)) wordcloud = WordCloud(max_font_size=40).generate(str(text)) plt.figure() plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation="bilinear") plt.axis("off") plt.show() &amp;#x200B;

Thanks was just curious about the word cloud generation
Used WordCloud, nothing special. I wasn't posting to show code. just that the outcome was kinda interesting.
You could be working on a separate sheet then what you intend to. There is a deprecated method get_sheet_by_name(), however you can still use it to work on the the desired worksheet. Also I'd appreciate if you ask programming questions on Stack overflow. That will result in faster solution to your problems. Also please give more information on how many sheets are there in the excel sheets and what code you have used.
Any type of feedback on the project will be welcome, whether positive or negative.
Thanks for your fast response and I will not post this kind of questions here from now on. Back to my question. What I do is: - loop every file - select the sheet (all files have same sheet structure) - read all the rows and perform some calculations. I dont think that I am on the wrong sheet because all the files work correctly except on that does this thing. I grab the sheet with file["sheet name"]["column coordinate"].
Yeah but only for 3.6+
This was a long time ago and I didn't remember the details precisely. I just looked into it again and it I think it was `os.system()`'s light wrapper that saved me. The platform was Linux, where `fork(2)` shares memory with CoW. With `subprocess`, forking in python was causing so much of the copied memory to be rewritten that it was running out of memory. The processes I was running were very lightweight and not python. When I switched to `os.system()`, none of the bulky python memory space was touched, so that space was saved due to CoW.
Could be hidden rows. 
Look into Hide/Unhide option in Excel. That may probably be one of the reason that you cannot see any data in the excel sheet.
San Diego
Yes that was it! God I feel stupid. I have been questioning my code for the past hour ... Thank you for pointing out the obvious.
Yes that was it. Thanks for your help
Nice. Would be interested to see a merkle tree implementation too. 
People like to joke that programming of python is just stringing together a bunch of 3rd party modules and this is a prime example of that. 
How about the speed of programming things with Python vs others? :-)) I get your point but for my Python is the only language I know decently so I can't change. I could but the speed savings will not counter weight the time dedicated to learning 
you guys have cars? :O
Could you rephrase your question, and describe what portions of your code do what to aid answering it? For example, are you asking if there's an underlying difference between the windows and linux python binaries? Or how the two operating systems manage resources with multi-processing? If so, could you share some windows+linux resources that explain the respective OSs memory management and ect, and point out what exactly you don't understand?
Built my career on it. I manage a team now!

My bad. Please see Edit1.
Much better. Might want to compose a TLDR version. I can probably run that for you tm anyway and follow up with results
The most obvious: Rename "BLACK JACK" to "blackjack.py". Then you have a lowecase module name and a file with a python source extension. 
Created using what?
Here is a [demo program](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_OpenCV_Webcam.py) that displays a webcam in a window. You can add your log output to that window. &amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker etc. but I've actually conceived of, planned and wrote this today and I'm super duper proud of myself :) &amp;#x200B; The computer will listen to what you say into your microphone and respond either with a pre-set phrase, or one from random from the sound effect library I found. &amp;#x200B; For a short conversation, try saying Hi Johnny, how are you, where are you from, time to turn you off, sorry! &amp;#x200B; Readme below for reflective purposes later: &amp;#x200B; The aim here was: 1.

Write a short list of how this programme could be improved: 1. Understand the os module! V. confused about filepaths 2. DRY this code... seems like a fair bit of repetition in terms of if a.**contains** which can probs be shortened down using some variation of variables and/or os module 3. Can it respond faster than it currently does (perhaps by shortening the duration of the adjustment for ambient noise)? 4. Can it respond more intelligently?//Can I incorporate a text to speech module that would allow it to talk back using user defined variables (e.g. What is your name? My name is XXX. Hi XXX!)? 4.

Dear Pythonengineering i am sorry for not reading the rules before posting anything. Thank you ) warm regards)
* It's a bad idea to use `list` as a variable name since it hides the `list` builtin. * The filename should have a `.py` extension. Github will then recognize it as Python and syntax-highlight it. * Your functions should have docstrings telling what they do. * The use of globals can be avoided. If a list is declared at module scope you can still modify its contents. Passing arguments to the functions is good for documentation, and isn't much more burdensome than declaring globals.
And What if this car is so slow?
Toyotas dont break.
python + pygame :) 
Does it still run? 
Which is why we have cython, llvm, numba, cuda, c-extensions, and dozens of other things to leverage the fastness of all the fast things. Plus with python development and learning are fast, which is more often the bottleneck or of greater value for many. Of course you are correct in the way you meant it, but I think slowness is a generalization python has grown out of when you consider the full stack of tools at the disposal of a python developer. 
Computer RNGs give a stream of bits to use. To turn those bits into a uniform random number between any arbitrary a and b, you need to use something like this to turn the 2-sided die rolls that the random bits give you into an (b - a + 1)-sided one.
For visual scanning of the program, the indents stand out and it is easier to troubleshoot.
I suppose that's true, but I'd argue that it's more long-winded that way. If the block of code has more than one expression, I'll indent it. But if it's just one short expression, I think it's neater and easier to follow if the if is paired up with the expression.
Script that does something with screenshots from the game? Like when you take a screenshot it automatically uploads it to a shared album with his friends. A much harder upgrade would be training a machine learning model to recognize characters or something in the screenshot and tag the file appropriately- not sure if that's even possible, just brainstorming. Maybe something with fortnight stats like how people try to predict fantasy football matches - use the stats to try and predict the outcome.
It’s one of this thins I’m happy they exist, but actually, never use them. The case where I would find it good practice would be if I had a series of, say, at least half a dozen of such short ifs. Having them in a block in a few consecutive lines without indentation would look right. OTOH, if I had half a dozen short ifs, there’d probably be some better structure than this. 
I have done it single line and indented with two lines. After I went back and was looking around I found that two lines with the indent is much better than a single line. Especially if I want to modify the code to work better or to do something else.
Nice! This was my "sunday project" as well. I made a wordcloud with titles from about 2300 classic rock songs. WordCloud makes it very easy. [Here it is.](https://imgur.com/a/Uce5WBp)

If you have a random binary array, you can cut it short at an arbitrary point after it's larger than you need, and therefore never need to build a dice from smaller dice.
For production use, you can do all sorts of minor tweaks for better output - for example use custom formatting, automatically added extra metadata, using filters to exclude logs you don't need, and so on. 
If you're already using VMs that's a good start (maybe even necessary) - but it can be useful to separate your app requirements from your system libraries. So if there is some change of functionality in a dependency your apt/certbot/etc won't be borked.
Any chance of sharing the code? Looks great!

That's cool, nice job. Now make it say that it needs input.
How long does it take to start up?
Why are you incrementing the variable 'a' in your script? I don't see it being used anywhere other than where you print it. Am I missing something?
webtask? yeah it's amazing. There is now.sh by zeit &amp; also the free tier of aws lambda funtions; which I was researching a bit. Would be nice to have some more options.
Check out python string formatting e.g. [https://pyformat.info/](https://pyformat.info/) There's a lot more you can do with the new formatting syntax, and in my opinion it makes the strings look cleaner.
Thanks! 
Nice work ! If you want to remove some redundancy with all your a.__contains__, I would suggest the use of a dictionary !
Thanks for the interest :) I think seaborn is great especially for exploratory analysis, but no interactive capabilities. I've also played around with bokeh but since discovering Altair it's all I want to use for interactive stuff. It generates [vega markup](https://vega.github.io/vega/) to describe the visualizations, which means the chart output does not depend on Altair software to render but instead technologies like [vega embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html). &amp;#x200B; For the plot I shared, I spent some time researching the distribution and generated my own data sources ([https://medium.com/@galea/cypherpunk-central-planning-crypto-distribution-inflation-charts-36f666ebf16d](https://medium.com/@galea/cypherpunk-central-planning-crypto-distribution-inflation-charts-36f666ebf16d))
Wow much simpler then I thought it would be , cool script
Truncating a binary stream gives you a random 2^(N) number, but it takes a little bit more processing to get a uniform random choice from a non-power-of-two-size set.
Yea true
What have you tried so far, do you have any code?
It's a simple way to keep track of how far he is in processing the submissions. If it doesn't increase he's getting stuck at one submission. He also gets some feeling of how long is left running the code.
Note that some of the stuff you have to learn early when you learn C or C++, like how text and memory works, is very useful to know about later on. You don't need it right away when you study Python, but will certainly want to know it some day. 
Wow...I Am also learning Django. I have done two projects already, a to-do-list and a small blog. You used a lot of technologies which I am not familiar with. Can you recommend me to resources I can keep learning Django. 
This is very cool and it really says so much more. Deep stuff. Kudos!
Without revealing too much about where I work, it's a private contracting firm. It most definitely is a security thing. Now I don't work in the sec department so I may be off by a few details but we essentially have a type of low-level "hyper-visor" that will not let you use any form of a binary whatsoever unless its checksum is on the global whitelist. So that newly updated QBitorrent won't run while last month's version will. A lot of us use scripts such as Python to do menial tasks. Not to mention most if not all servers are wiped clean periodically which prevents installation of anything for any period longer than a an hour. &amp;#x200B; We live in different times today after incidents such as the Experian hack went down. Such a rigorous security protocol is mandatory.
Unfortunately, to interact with the site you need to reverse-engineer the javascript of the site or use something like Puppeteer library for node.js to control the full-blown (preferably headless) browser. I am not aware of such a solution for Python, though. Alternatively, you can control the system itself with pywin32 for windows (I’m sure there are equivalents for other desktops) making it click here, click there. Doable and fun, but makes your computer a living movie tv-trope for a moment. 
Which technology did you use? 
If I had to take one thing, it would be this repository: https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django

Make a game with the pygame module this will help you with learning how pygame works so that you can make graphically pleasing projects in the future.
I've started using tkinter for GUIs but I'll give it a try. I already have a text tog, maybe I improve on that with pygame. Thanks 
That would be great. Thanks ! I will do as you suggested on TLDR.
Have a look at nltk, it contains a corpus of common stopwords, like "go" and "will" that you can then filter out of your word cloud. You can also try stemming the words if you encounter a lot of different conjugations of the same word. 
lol instead of while (True==True): j5() maybe write while 1: j5() 
Completely depends, and to be honest I (and many other people - most professional programmers in my experience) know and program in the same amount of time in most languages I know. Learning is a one time cost. To answer the question of is it worth it though, consider this: https://xkcd.com/1205/ 
There is a lot to put into this decision aside from speed: - How many simultaneous connections can your database server handle in addition to whatever else it is doing? - How long does it take to insert this data, and how will that be affected over time as more and more data is being added? - How large is the data being inserted? - Is this app only going to run from one location, or many? - How frequently does this process occur? - What other activity happens on the database while the application is running? In other words, there are many factors aside from speed that should be considered before deciding on how to handle 4k inserts as part of an application running. Most of which involve the scalability of the database server relative to the impact this operation will have on anything else the server is used for.
Now you have me thinking about the algorithm for font layout that WordCloud must use. 
That would be cool, but it's pretty unrelated to the blog post topic, right?
Could also be a good idea contributing to opensource. There are so many projects out there and you will most likely find something interesting. There's a lot to be learn from reading other peoples code, submitting pull requests and get feedback.
Agreed, I only use reddit on my phone and it's hidden unless you look for it. For new redditors, like I was not so long ago, it's not something you'd think to look for until you stumble upon one of those posts about poor reddiquette.
thought the AWS lamba / free tier is limited for one year.. Is there a constantly free option for lambda? 
python ;)
Continue thread "What are you working on this week". That's awesome - I always get lost in it...
That's awesome work!
Well I saw that deduplication and hashing was covered, I wondered if a merkle tree might make for an efficient way of approaching this (for comparing directories). 
Oooh I'm not familiar with this... It just means while true and its always true yes? 
iirc it's totally free up to 1m executions/mo; that being said - there's a 5 minute max execution time; limiting it's use case for a lot of things. You can get that timeout increased; but its a pain.
It's nice code (although not 100% PEP compliant ;)... (e.g. TWO lines of space after each function)
I'm not aware of Merkle tree being used outside of cryptography. The hashing here is used as a quick way of comparing files, that avoids comparing byte for byte...
Do something with databases. Like scrape or download some data, store it in an sqlite database, male some some simple statistics etc.
Yes, this absolutely is cool.
Thanks man 
 while True: j5() is generally the preferred way to loop indefinitely in Python (it's equivalent to 'while 1:' but explicitly using the Boolean value is preferred).

Wow. I like all those self-descriptive one-liner functions, but I'm completely in love with the logic in edits1. My clunky self would have probably devised a multiline memory-slurping function for each of those edits. I'll be using this as inspiration :)

One small thing also is that if you ever need to expand the block inside the `if`, then with a single line style, you'll have an increased line change in version control: one for changing the `if` line, and the rest of your changes. If you put your block on a new line right from the start, now any changes are reflecting actual line changes, unlike the single line style 
I hadn't considered this. Interesting point!

umm about 10 minutes! it's not a very big script.
Does it work without the proxy? Does the site need javascript to login? If so you might have to use selenium or headless chrome. You should probably put the username/password and other such info in a text file because people that don't sometimes accidentally upload their credentials when commiting or showing code.
I already explained it in the , in the very below part of the network tab there are 4 requests (name , pass, \_csrf thing, and an empty phone) &amp;#x200B; I filled them all in my code and it still didn't work...

Try heading over to r/learnpython they generally are better for help with python. 
it doesn't work without proxy. How can I check if site need javascript? I don't know that I'm only beginner. And people says selenium is so slow, so I'm trying to avoid it. Is there really any benefit of using it anyway? (im not familiar with selenium) &amp;#x200B; and what you mean by headless chrome? And thanks for your suggestion with passwords, i will keep that in my mind &amp;#x200B;
thanks!
No problem! 
Awesome! Could you explain a bit about how you went about making it?
Debatable, how are those programs that you love writing that runs multiple 3rd party modules by default?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
I have an arduino connected to a motor controller then the arduino serial port takes in data from the raspberry pi. There is a python script the takes the cwiid library that connects the wii remote. I then normalised the accelerometer data and used it as a scalar for two motors. Then used forward and back buttons on wii remote. 
&gt;How can I check if site need javascript? I don't know that I'm only beginner. Try your web browser with javascript turned off to see if the site still works. Requests can't do javascript so it won't help if the site needs JS. &gt;selenium. Is there really any benefit of using it anyway? It's a way to control a web browser automatically, therefore it'll work as it's indistinguishable from a human - unless their anti-scraper is very sophisticated or you blow your cover by sending commands too fast. "Headless" means "no screen" so headless Chrome is similar to what you're doing now but it uses chrome instead of requests. Again it should work but I've never used it. 
What about those small little math projects people write in Python? Those calculators you must know that what you are creating all run multiple 3rd party modules right?
Whatever tools you use (cx_freeze, Pyinstall, py2exe) it all boils down to distilling the python installation directory to a pure minimum and copying it alongside your project; suplementing required dynamic libraries (DLLs) and probably making some ”shortcuting” (innoSetup and the likes) to polish a pro experience. You should test it on a separate machine (better still a VM) with no hint of Python anywhere.
Anyways i'm not going to get deep into this since i'm not a python fanboy but Lol.
From wikipedia: Hash trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. They can help ensure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks. Hash trees are used in hash-based cryptography. Hash trees are also used in the IPFS, Btrfs and ZFS file systems[4] (to counter data degradation[5]); Dat protocol; Apache Wave protocol[6]; Git and Mercurial distributed revision control systems; the Tahoe-LAFS backup system; Zeronet; the Bitcoin and Ethereum peer-to-peer networks[7]; the Certificate Transparency framework; and a number of NoSQL systems such as Apache Cassandra, Riak, and Dynamo.[8] Suggestions have been made to use hash trees in trusted computing systems.[9]
If your goal is just to send money around, there is a multitude of existing software to do that, including things targeting clubs specifically. But if you want to build something, sure, you can do that. Just find Python libraries for each part you have and stitch them together. I'm not clear on how users are supposed to interact with this, it what "I intercepts" means. Can you lay out the user workflow, and what problem this is solving?
People really want a fucking good time. 
&gt; like to **joke** 
How did you manage to connect it to the wiimote? Using just Bluetooth? Thanks :)
Working on a registry-diff program. Use case is installing unknown software on windows and wanting to see what kind of claws it digs into the registry. I have the functionality for taking an image, taking a diff image, and comparing them on a basic level to see if a key is new/deleted/has values that changed. Once it's done, maybe expand it to include generating scripts to undo the changes between registry images.
Yeah it's just a basic Bluetooth setup you pair it at launch of the program. 
Lol.
Makes sense.
Curious, what's the point of it? Sorry I'm not familiar with ntlk other than it's used to score words. I just wanted to see what one would derive from a word cloud.
Cool
So where do those reddit functions come from? Maybe I’m missing something but they do most of the heavy lifting and they seem kind of magical the way you’re using them. 
Isn't all programming magic?
Are you sure you're in 3.6? That's an error that comes up for me when I try to run the older version of Discord.py on 3.7 (since they made async a reserved keyword in Python 3.7). If you're on Python 3.6, use the old version of Discord, and if you're on 3.7 use Discord.py rewrite (which you will unfortunately have to manually install from the terminal I believe) 
Haha yes. It was a phrase one of my earlier bosses said to me when I showed him something that did a lot with one function. Of course the logic was spelled out somewhere, we just weren’t looking under the hood. I thought it was a apt comparison. 
I would guess that you can't use an asynchronous function as a decorator, but I have no experience with decorators so I might be wrong.
I don't see "antiqueing". :P &amp;#x200B;
Cool project!
You need to close your print statements properly dk if this has anything to do with the error but it should be print(“hello” + (bot.user.id))
I am sure i am running 3.6, should i get an older version of discord.py?
What is this? A car for ants?
This also deserves a place in /r/dataisbeautiful
Is anyone else triggered by the loose cables?
Yes me. The second acrylic sheet hasn't arrived yet where I will be able to cable manage well. 
Almost seems like I could make a complete sentence out of it if only I followed the "maze" correctly.
what does that mean?
Please post questions like this on /r/learnpython (read the sidebar for more information). However, you are missing parenthesis. Without correct syntax you can't be sure this error means what you think it means. Correct your code and see what happens then. You are missing a closing parenthesis on line 11 and 12.
I posted on r/learnpython but no help. I did fix the parenthesis but the syntax error was sill there.
fixed that but there still is an error, thanks for the help anyways
I used to install pip/virtualenv via easyinstall on win7, but switched to win10 Linux for Windows subsystem since I prefer my dev environment to be a bit closer to production setup

Hey, just curious, why did you go with a full fledged DB implementation over something like a text/pickle file?
Realized what went wrong. Whenever I saved the file it would be a 3.7 even though it started as 3.6 so I deleted python 3.7 and it should run now
I clicked expecting to see an actual car
Oh sorry that's next tho lol. 
That's pretty simple + cool congrats for the link ;) 
Hey sorry for such a late reply, but I just finished the script and I'll share the github repo once I finish the readme file explaining how it works
Primarily for education purposes. Wanted to make sure I could implement basic db functions on a smaller project before I applying them on something larger.
Ah, makes sense. Well done! It looks great :). 
Qs: (sorry if i'm being dumb), but how does one download the data for the most popular comments, and have a count of the comment frequencies??

Cause my mate yoinked it.

&gt; \&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x is y) '''comparing the types''' Surely you mean `'''comparing the identities'''`, right?
When I read it, you described inspecting what I thought was an element and seeing those, that is a bit different than seeing exactly what the request is including headers. Maybe that's what you meant. If the whole request was pasted in here I might have a more helpful answer.
Why use an Arduino? Can't the Raspi do PWM? 
Yeah but it's easier to use the arduino for me it's the first time ic done something like this. 
It's called floating point arithmetic, when you're representing decimal numbers in binary sometimes they're irrational in base 2 when they're not in base 10. 
Welcome to computing :)
This is beautiful 
So this is what happened in Office Space.
You could do : print(int(fi+n2)) This will exclude the decimals and inly display the integers. 
It's a floating point round off error. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error To fix it look into string formatting.
because it’s a float 
Thank you :)
Irrationality doesn't depend on base. If it's rational in an integer base it must be rational in all other integer bases, and vice versa. Rather it's an issue of how the number is represented by the hardware.
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like? 
So you're telling me 1/3 is irrational in both base 10 and base 3???
Quick answer: The hardware has limited precision for floating point. Read this for more info: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
Irrational means it can't be written as a/b. 1/3 is rational.
“The golden number(ratio) is known as Phi” FTFY. 
https://0.30000000000000004.com/ There's an actual technical answer for you. 
True, apologies for confusing definitions there, I'm not sure how to word my response with this now
Ah, fair enough. By the way, check out the ESP8266, it runs the same code as the Arduino but with more RAM/storage and has wifi.
1/3 would repeat in both base-10 and base-3. Similarly, pi would never repeat in any numeral system.
Shit
Is there a way to do this in python 2? I get this when I try. $ python -m pdb -c continue file.py Error: -c does not exist
Just a suggestion but... instead of the controller being sideways you should make it to where you tilt the controller while holding it normally to have it turn it would make it more 'natural' feeling in your hands (well with that controller anyway).
I have a problem with "pass by value" and "pass by reference" in python, because the interpreter doesn't do either of those things.
It is pretty cool what you have done ;)
This really belongs in /r/learnpython.
I wish I could understand this and make a darknet market!
I guess what I'm asking is is there a list of all the mimetypes? What are all the mimetypes that a binary file could be? 
the components on the receiving end of those cables are also triggered
Thanks I now see this on the side bar.. Feels bad. Deleting 
I wrote this script to avoid having to spend roughly 10 minutes manually typing this information in. The site that the info is scraped from requires a login and does not allow the user to copy and paste using the mouse. The script makes use of selenium, gspread, and the Google Sheets API. I have it running on a cron job every three months to update the spreadsheet.
You can deal with float errors by using round(). Try print( round( fi + num2, 6) ) change 6 to however many decimal places you want. Float errors are a glitch of computers trying to base decimals into binary language.
This is so useful thank you!
Good thing to automate... depending on your use case though you may be interested in the =GOOGLEFINANCE() option of google sheets to have stock data
I’ve found that useful! The third column actually injects ‘=GOOGLEFINANCE(“‘ +company_tikr+’”, “price”)’
Pretty amazing stuff!
What’s wrong with the subprocess module?
Any good resources for learning about __init__.py? Still have a sort of tenuous understanding of what can really be done with it. 
Commenting for later
MAN LOVE TIME
Whaddup dude! Glad to see you post d this here. :D GREAT WORK!!
Pass a reference by value.
Looks interesting from a quick glance!
I use it all the time for cleaner type-like checking like you mentioned so I'm not checking for list, set, ndarray, etc. Much cleaner than explicit type checking
The solo learn app worked well for me

Nothing, the OP asked what habits we wished we'd **un**-learned.
Very impressed! I just started using flask and getting into the whole web development realm of things. And I can't even compare what I've made to yours. I hope to get to that level of skill one day 
I’m down - Denver
pythonista
Fuck that looks good, was this your first flask project and how long did it take you? Did you have to write CSS etc.?
Thank you. I have been learning flask for over a year now. Flask is easy. It's the front end funkyness that makes you pull out your hairs. If I have to split my effort b/w backend and frontend it would be 30-70 split. 
Thank you. No this isn't my first project. I made few CRUD based applications before , mainly blogs and stuff. And yes, I had to write css , js and everything to make it pretty. It took me around a month, mainly because I couldn't dedicate time after work to finish it. Flask is the easiest bit here. Basic routing , a crud op to create the user and a mailing service. It's the frontend funkyness that made me pull out my hair. I'm currently trying to learn a bit of frontend framework like AngularJS. 
This is really neat and helpful information. Thank you!
Can you explain in more detail how you can turn a phone into a bluetooth hotspot? A sounds really interesting. So does your fibonacci sequence music player, I'd really like to know more about how that works. 
As a new coder, I'm curious, do you have any advice on how to go about learning so as to avoid the issue you faced? 
&gt; How about the speed of programming things Not particularly great. Lisp does better in this respect, for example. Also, this would really depend on the type of a project, and what it means to test it. If you need to install it with pip to test it, your times may be comparable to compilation times even of C++...
Nice work 👍🏼
Ok thanks i might try that it sounds interesting. 
Ye I read people's code a lot and it helps. I will try and contribute to open source. 
Johnny 5 is alive!
Would you share the code? I'm trying to figure out how to make my Google account and Python to talk to each other with no success. Also, the output is nice but how long did it take you?
I would use SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for that. Those are at least the most commonly used ORMs in Ptyhon.
Well done! I have used the SRTM1 data myself. I use Python and GIS almost daily. I haven't done itself yet but one can even go one step further. On ["*The Tile Downloader*"]: http://dwtkns.com/srtm30m/ which you also linked to, you can download a GeoJSON file of the tiles worldwide. Each time a query is made and it falls outside the dataset you already have, the applicable tile can automatically be downloaded and added to your local dataset.
That's silly. But me too. Hey Matt, buy this ^^^^
Amazing buddy.
this looks infuriating to try and control
Shouldn't you be paying attention to school?
Fucking 
Yo dude lol. 
Ok thanks 
Thanks 
I was going to ask what you were using for the front end. &amp;#x200B; Vue?
Wow, amazing creativity.
Thank you
For this project it's plain JavaScript. Maybe a bit of jQuery. But personally I am trying to learn AngularJS as they use it in my office. But Vue seems to be easier to get started with.
Still working on a script for downloading content from YouTube. Trying to make it user-friendly and especially improve its logic.
Oh that's really cool. Yeah, I guess JQuery does support a lot of smooth animations. Frontend is my crux because of the sensitive nature of animations :/. Good work though. Presentation looks great :)
Came up with this function. Seems to be working fine. def get_longest_streak(sequence): streak, longest = 1, 1 for i in range(len(sequence)-1): if sequence[i] != sequence[i+1]: streak += 1 else: longest = max(streak, longest) streak = 1 return max(streak, longest) &amp;#x200B;
Sure 🤝
Read online tutorials and documentation, code in Pydroid 3

You can still run it with 'python - m pdb file.py', after which you need to press c once to get to the error. What the '-c continue' does is automatically press c for you.
Thanks. It gets easier by following along the footsteps of some well known designer guys on YouTube. I follow caller Edwards for design related inspiration.
1. Try to google "project euler problem 3 python" 2. try to format code correctly at reddit. There is a menu bar that helps you to formt posts.
The problems in Project Euler are actually more mathematical exercises than programming exercises, mostly concerning number theory. Trying to solve them by brute force doesn't work: that will take too long. Instead you're expected to think it through carefully and come up with better algorithms. Just optimizing an inefficient algorithm is not going to be fast enough. In this case, there better faster ways to find the prime factors of a number. This is what I use: def find_prime_factors(n): i = 2 while n &gt; 1: while n % i == 0: yield i n //= i i += 1 The answer to the problem is then found with: max(find_prime_factors(600851475143)) &amp;#x200B;
Awesome! What Python library did you use to make the Wiimote usable? 
In your first test, you are supposedly testing "creation of **uninitialized** arrays", but you are using `numpy.zeros` instead of `numpy.empty`. Instead of `time.time()` you could also consider using the `%timeit` magic of IPython which is a bit more stable as it runs multiple times. Especially important for the tests which only take milli- or microseconds to complete.
I made a tiny python script to return infos from a system like currently used ram, disk space etc, maybe it can help you: https://github.com/Merwanedr/Jutsu

&gt; One aspect of Python programming that trips up those coming from languages like C **or Java** Hold up, WTF is this? Java's object semantics are almost the same as Python's. 
Gracias
 &gt; Could you suggest one? That would work with Python and Maya? I used flexlm, which is pretty much the most flexible option. There are plenty others. &gt; This is actually an interesting part. I wonder how can I avoid it but still make it read config on load. It is a plugin, it has to do stuff at startup. I suppose I should be using __init__ files for that or what? When main is called, you load the config. &gt; And you're just spitting acid all over. My worry is that you don't understand that what we are saying is a good suggestion.

Wrong again. The ct200h only shares its drivetrain with the 3rd gen Prius. Everything else is newly designed by the Lexus side of things. 
True, but that's only a problem in the opposite direction, coming from Python to Java. In contrast, a Java programmer confused by Python's objects... Probably struggles in Java too.
Hmm take your time. Don’t overwhelm yourself in one day. Learn a concept and make a few from programs, no matter how big or small -implementing that new concept until you feel comfortable. As you progress in your learning start implementing a concept you learned last week with something you just learned today. That’s what I’d do. In college I just took a tonnnn of notes. I spent so much time writing basic Syntax down I didn’t get a chance to process it until it was too late.

I've used QPython3 to fill in time with small coding activities on my phone, seems to work quite well. As you've got the basic sorted maybe find some simple exercises/projects online and attempt to code the up.

Why you don't use google spreadsheet api?
&gt; My worry is that you don't understand that what we are saying is a good suggestion. &amp;#x200B; I understand it. I was just trying to get more details and information about it. I did tell that my questions were provocative on purpose, but please, do calm down :D It was just a form of discussion. There are no star imports in my code and I even made sure to double check it and clean up whatever I had left. It's just that seeing this in others' work that got me to question this rule. &amp;#x200B; &gt; When main is called, you load the config. &amp;#x200B; Well, at first I thought that I can't do this because Maya does not call \_\_main\_\_ when I need. Then I realized that I can call it manually when plugin's initializePlugin function is called, or make my own init functions that'll run only during initial startup. Thanks. The one problem I'll need to solve is that I want to have some of those variables accessible at root of the module. for example I want to be able to use \`from module import progressBar\`, but progressBar has to be initialized with a code that aquires it from host application first. If I initialize progressBar variable during init of the module as None, it will then overwrite any change to this variable. Turning it into a class or function that always calls for host's progressBar is also not ideal. Though maybe I could turn it into a class and initialize it in each individual module. I suppose it's hard for you to give any advice here without being familiar with details. &amp;#x200B; &gt; I used flexlm, which is pretty much the most flexible option. There are plenty others. I don't suppose it does anything to protect Python code, though? Just licensing server? I will still have to think how to lock down my code. &amp;#x200B; FlexLM seems like overkill for my project, and it's surprisingly hard to find much information about it. It also seems that it was discontinued and changed into FlexNet? Or is it another system? And I remember dealing with it, a lot of 3ds max and Maya plugins used it back in the day. It was a hassle to work with on the client side. I suppose I'll have to look for other solutions.
Thank you!
Makes sense, I think. Linux distros ship with Python and most people just use what’s available there. Windows does not have that. 
thanks for the info... just a quick question - do you always have to declare what a dictionary type is before you set it to something? for example I'm trying to iterate over a list and use that info as a key that would be an array in the end. here is some sample code that gives me the same error. If i say `b[a]=[]` it works, but that's kind of annoying not having it dynamically assign type when it doesn't care about type elsewhere. Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) [GCC 8.2.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; a=1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b={} &gt;&gt;&gt; b[a].append('f') Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; KeyError: 1

Can we stop this trend of plastering faces on links to GitHub and programming blogs? As a demographic, we are not photogenic. Also, this isn't linkedin.
Cwiid. 
This post held at zero votes for the better part of an hour and then went from zero votes to 35 within the span of a few minutes. This combined with the fact that this humble bundle package has been unusually heavily advertised makes me suspicious that OP is manipulating this in some way. I could be wrong, but even so I'm tired of this ad
We’re waiting u/PsychicPanda53 
I'll reply to the rest tonight. To "protect" the code (because it's always a weak protection) the most common strategy is to use pyinstaller with an encryption key. It produces a single executable that performs the decryption and unpacking when you invoke it. But if you want strong, guaranteed protection against reverse engineering of your code, you are fighting a losing battle. At some point, your code must exist unpacked, otherwise it can't run, and at that point it can be reverse engineered. 
Considering the final link ends with `?partner=somedeals14` this individual is probably getting a cut for the sales driver from the link.
Yup. I says "Thank you for supporting Some Deals" on the top of the page.
Feel free to steal some of my code! It originally used turtle but I switched to tkinter! [https://github.com/SerpentChris/PyShapes](https://github.com/SerpentChris/PyShapes)
Adding to this, it held at zero, shot up to around 35, and is holding again, which is not natural post behavior. It's not very step function-y if it's not an ad
Very cool. Can you share your code?
Remember to mark it as spam, so the moderation team can take care of it. 
so what? good info is good info. Its not like it costs more for you... maybe the sick children tho
Start. 
Nice! thanks
NO !
It's fine as long as there [are two spaces](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id32) before the comment.
Not really, no. You can do Java-style dependency injection in Python, but it's rarely useful. What sort of services are you looking to put in there?
Source?
Why is it rarely useful in Python? It's used all the time in Java
Because Python doesn't really follow the "everything is a class and has state" design patterns you're used to from Java. There's generally a lot less global state being passed around that's not just a global variable.
quick update: I've released version 0.6 to github and pypi, which fully supports wrapping / truncating long string in a cell or a column name. It also does by defaults text wrapping if it encounters newlines in a cell or a column name, though you can alternatively have newlines replaced by a string. See examples in the doc here:[https://github.com/ofirmanor/nicetable#text-wrapping-and-newlines](https://github.com/ofirmanor/nicetable#text-wrapping-and-newlines) I plan to focus next on cleaner injection of lists and dicts (no need for explicit append() loop most of the time).
Hello, it's super, can you share your code on github ? a lot of people might be interrested :)
Thanks. This last part I didn't fully follow tho: &gt;There's generally a lot less global state being passed around that's not just a global variable. So generally python is just using things that are basically global variables to pass state around? I did notice the Flask request was like this
I never had much success with pwm on the Pi

Always great to see these sorts of things. If you're passionate about it, I've always thought Python could use a really fully functional, but easy to use text UI (I know there's urwid and curses but they've both got their issues.). One thing that I always think is missing is the ability to have sort of two 'screens' at once - so have an area to the right of your menu choices where you can display text/variables etc. You could also think about having optional sub-text for your menu items as well.
Hi, looks like we have similar idea 🍻 I like the idea to determine "Most LOL" and "Longest monologue" part. Btw, did you notice that the exported \*.txt file has different result in iOS and Android? Also the date format is depends on phone date format settings?
I have seen lots of talk about how to do DI and that "X is a DI framework" about Java stuff.. can you explain why is dependency injection needed in Java? I have done web development using Pyramid (Python) and Ruby on Rails If you need stuff to be available in many controllers then you can create a base class for your controllers and create or configure the stuff that you need in the constructor of the base class. That's what I have used.
How are you driving the motors? I've had endless problems with motors not spinning consistently, which seems to be because I'm not powering them appropriately. Also, did you have to do the "solder a capacitor across the motor terminals to reduce noisy signals" thing?
Very cool! An alternative to gspread is pygsheets. I didn't know about gspread, but I do like pygsheets pandas-like feel and capabilities.
The Flask request object is a bit more magicky than that, but generally you just don't use globals that often and pass state explicitly.
Sure no problem, this should help you: ***Start your homework earlier***
You have to break it down into understandable and actionable chunks. If you break it down and it seems like too much, break it down further. We have a remote control car driven by a Wiimote. It uses the gyro inputs from the Wiimote (this isn't as bad as it sounds). We need to turn some wheels which means we need to drive a motor. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume it isnt a stepper motor. Apply the correct DC voltage and the DC motors spin. It may be able to reverse. I dunno. In that case we need to apply the voltage in another location as well. The car is likely steered via servo. Figure out servo turning angle. We need to set up the arduino to only output values within that range. We'll assume the arduino only controls the motors and nothing else. It waits for prompts from another device. We need a communication protocol. We'll use I2C because if we do it right we won't need to shift voltage level logic. The arduino will be a slave device. The brains of the operation will be a raspberry pi. It has bluetooth and you can bet there is a python library for just about anything. Find python I2C library, GPIO library, and wiimote library. Prepare your I2C message protocol. We need go, stop, reverse (maybe), and steer (with an angle). You can pick arbitrary IDs, you only need enough room to store accurate turning angles. From here figure out the inputs from the wiimote. The buttons will all be digital inputs and the gyro will be two analog axes. The analog axes will have a limited range and the library documentation will likely explain how they work. We don't want to turn that far to steer, so stay somewhere in the middle and limit the analog outputs. Figure out how bluetooth syncing works in the raspberry pi. Figure out what you are going to power this stuff with. Hopefully it will be something rechargeable. Wire some junk and test outputs. See if you can pair the Wiimote to the pi and read values. Test everything one piece at a time. If you don't know what any of this means, step 0 is researching all of this on Google. In short, that's how you draw the rest of the fucking owl.
My teacher assigned it today...
God forbid this ever gets into production. This is terrible D: Please don't write abstractions of things you don't understand well... There are so many problems with this, I don't even know where to begin: case sensitivity, locale, terrible performance, all kinds of special cases for names, modes, permissions... Not to mention that while FTP kind of represents filesystem, object store, like S3 doesn't even come close, especially in terms of its transactional properties, its persistence model... This obviously misses important features of filesystems like snapshots, deduplication, compression; for networked filesystems it misses... well, everything about it. Locking is an important part of fileystems life, which is not reflected here... Real life fileystems have real-life settings like how much caching to do, whether to encrypt and when, block size, optimal I/O size, whether to allow certain operations like truncation etc. None of which is relfected in this "abstraction"... And this is only the tip of the iceberg: filesystems are very interesting and complex programs, but they are nothing like this library represents them.
And how long have you known about the exam?
We found out about the date 3 weeks ago but that doesn’t excuse my teacher for giving me a assignment on a day of a exam. I have another one the day after that. I did review before but I still have to revise and it can take some time. 
Github? 
They're awesome :D I've used a few in my own projects. Usually get them for 2-3 dollars each. You could potentially eliminate the raspberry on the car, and send commands over wifi. Not sure if the delay will be too much.
[Here](http://bash.org/?3936)
Is it already over? Anyway, thanks for the sharing
Did your teacher choose those variable names? If so please tell him that he should read PEP-8
Life is bitter 
I do use the Google Sheets api, gspread is a Python library for using it
Oh, nice! I’ll check that out 
So I'm fairly new to Python and I've finally started understand this ... but kind of by "feel". &amp;#x200B; Can some one give me some pointers on "how" is should be using this? &amp;#x200B; For example, I wrote a simulation that needed to track a grid, so I make a dictionary and reference it everywhere (kind of like a global variable?) knowing that it's always going to be the same thing. &amp;#x200B; Is this bad? I have no idea...
Imagine you have a class that is needed in two different controllers. And that class is dependent on another class or resource, say a database connection. Makes more sense to instantiate that class once as a singleton and pass it between controllers. You could keep that class as a global but by creating a service layer and keeping it there and passing it explicitly to all controllers that use it makes unit testing much easier.
yeah, it should be over.. what do you get when you click the coupon link?
Have you worked with a service container before
Ha. Agreed that it's annoying, but it's really Guthub and reddit's fault--there's no reason why the user profile image should be the default when linking to a repo. 
Anyone did comparison to make sure f string is fastest?

It's been in production for 10 years, and has commercial sponsorship. It offers a similar level of abstraction to filesystem operations as supplied by the standard library. Yes, I'm fully aware that S3 isn't a real filesystem, but in many cases it can be treated as one, with some performance considerations. PyFilesystem doesn't attempt to expose all functionality on every 'filesystem', just the common denominator operations that cover more than most applications will ever use. 
oh, I had given some extra time to be on the safer side.. I guess that is over now.. if you'd like, I can send you a copy - please DM your email

Very nice! Looking forward to see the upgrade to throw the shells! :)
I used the SoloLearn app and QPython3 to practice.
Yes, and I've never really had a need for one in Python. Can you explain your use case in more detail?
DI &amp; IoC are used in Python, but generally not in a specialised container. I think of a service container as way to connect components at runtime, probably with some dynamic language or DSL. That's just what a dynamic language naturally does.
No, it doesn't - it's just a fancier UI for the same thing.
Is it out of box directly or does it require any plugin ?
The database support requires PyCharm Ultimate, but otherwise works out of the box. 
get lost on the way to /r/learnpython ?
Hmm, I guess it's doing it in software (maybe even userspace), which would make it very jittery...
Sounds too good to be true. Its now on my "gotta check out list" for 2019 =D
Very good points , thank you!
I have got the Pro version. Let me see / enable toolbar views again. Thank you !
What's a good library in Python for DI &amp; IoC?
Okay, which python libraries. 
Thank you

Forget it, you don't really even understand what filesystem is... I was expecting a library that works with fileysystems like ZFS, EXT2/3/4, F2FS, XFS, JFS, NFS, FTPFS, SSHFS, NTFS, FAT, ISO, TAR, SMB, VMFS, GFS and so on... and, hopefully having extensions for fuse, and adding less known filesystems, to actually do things with filesystem, like snapshots, backups, replication, mounting... *that* would've been useful. Instead, this is some kind of a toy project, that cannot even handle any actual filesystem properly. What it does, is: it does a very reduced set of file operations, that have very little to do with filesystems. Mostly it does them incorrectly, by using Python wrappers for system calls...
I've never used a library for it. One thing you can can do is put the DB into a module and import it. Python modules are global singletons by default. Another thing you can do is just pass the DB object to whatever class that needs it.
I have looked at the code and its quite easy. Please find the solution below: please do(){ your own homework; } &amp;#x200B;
Your error is not a type error but a key error. This exception gets thrown because the key a does not exist in the dictionary. Either you could write a function which creates this key and value [ ] first if it does not exist or you could use defaultdict from collections and assign empty lists to missing keys automatically. Regarding your original question: a TypeError will always be thrown if your value has no append() method. But this is not the problem in your example.
Next gen scalextric?
Right. Thanks
Yup I definitely need to buy this
Technincally I guess you could consider a package or module similar to a "service container" as it can contain the state, and associated code to manage it, and they can be nested into namespaces.
Pressing A button now, sir
The shifter is essentially part of the drivetrain. 
Holy moly, that's something I had in the back of my head for a while. Really good job! :D 
I'm devastated by your disappointment with me, /u/crabone. But PyFilesystem is an interface to file systems, so I think the name is fairly apt. I'm just glad nobody discovered this was a toy project in the last ten years. It's been a good run.
Here is the github repo. https://github.com/drewvlaz/grade-checker-script I will continue to update the script. This is a solution for a specific website and will need some tweaking. Lmk if you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to make it better. 
Awesome. Thank you!
Tried that but it's too hard to setup without a screen. Basically this works right now when you plug it in.

Sure, and its whole dashboard, including the shifter layout and radio and everything, is from the prius.
well, PEP are guidelines. Sometimes it's smart to ignore some of its 'rules'. In this case, where we only have 40 lines of code I think it's acceptable ;)

The decimal module provides support for fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic. It offers several advantages over the float datatype https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
I’m using this automate a part of my investment process, which is manually typing company names and tickers into this spreadsheet. The site I use doesn’t allow for copying and pasting, so I wrote this script to automate this. I then look up each company and write a description of what they do
Is it for researching new stocks to Invest in?
Yes! I have it set to run as a cron job every three months, so the spreadsheet is automatically filled out. Then all I do is look up the companies
Are you waiting for them to dip or? I am more interested in what you use automation for, rather than how you do it. I know how to automate, but I have a hard time finding tasks to automate. Don't know if anyone can relate.
Nice
Now mount a Webcam to a small Particle Photon, and have a Mario Kart kart skin 3D printed so you can actually drive it around and it feel like Mario Kart.
Both frowned upon and bad practice :-) The thing about concision is that it is a balance. I suggest you read more code. A good source is the code for the standard library; you will get an idea for what the community deems good, Pythonic code, (and possibly learn a little more about whats in those included batteries).
I normally prefer to be more verbal over concise and smart. But this piece of code achieves simplicity and clearness in a special way; edits1 is a beauty. How can such (relatively) complex algorithms can be expressed in such a simple way?
So it scrapes some company info from a site called [magic formula investing](magicformulainvesting.com) . You can read all the details on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/ginglis13/magic-formula-scraper) 
You don't. I use python for work since 2.3 and I am still an amateur.
Yes maybe I should have started looking at the GitHub hehe, thanks for sharing!
Do not post this statement to high-traffic Python threads ... ;) I'm fine with it - I got attacked oftentimes for not writing "Pythonic" code...
I've done a little. It's been consistently faster than both **str.format** and printf-style % strings for identical work being done. For very small things that could be handled by a single concatenation of strings it's not as fast (ie `car = "Ford"; print(f"I drive {car}")`, though obviously it's more flexible. Once you start embedding function calls in the f-string and going into things that can't be done directly with the other pure formatting operations it slows considerably, and the weird eager evaluation makes it a lot harder to read and reason about... though it does tend to result in some awfully tidy looking code. That said there's no obvious path to internationalization with them, which bothers me because much of my work involves automating interfaces that might be used by people anywhere in the world.
It is good "do it" style code. I like to make further concessions to Pythonic style if this is to be maintained over time. * I would add an `\`if __name__ == "__main__":\`` block * I woul create and assign WORD then call the functions appropriately from this block. &amp;#x200B;
Haha, can you do this on my real car as well?
This is complex stuff... how long have you been working on this? Anyways, thanks for sharing!
I know latest PyCharm can use WSL as a Python source, but not venvs. Can it use one in docker? 
Tbh you probably could lol. 
The only place I use them is conditional assignment. my_var = 20 if condition_true else 10 Never for normal `if`. Just too hard to parse.
Gosh you are rude. Python tries to have a helpful community; try exercising some self control if you can - a little practice and politeness can become second nature.
Cool! 
ctrl-f for Python Skills to get to the point.
On Linux you use either distro packages (.deb, .rpm, ...) or just pip
GUIs are over-rated. i work for a company that specializes in HPC - and lemme tell you, we spend a LOT of time in the shell. like, we live in the shell, we eat in the shell, we sleep there, kind of lot of time. &amp;#x200B; so text menus are pretty cromulent. 
PySimpleGUI continues be to quite actively developed into 2019. The latest addition is WxPython support. You can write GUI once and run on 3 different GUI frameworks without changing your source code.

This is awesome! I made a script that runs automatically everyday and emails me if it is anyone's birthday. I've thought about converting it to a flask app but don't think I have the skills to do that yet. Great work
They do share a lot of similarities. To say they are the same is misinformed though. Arguing about it is dumb. They are both great cars and I hope you have a great time in life making over generalized statements both small and large in seriousness. 
Awesome, I appreciate it. Thanks!
I just gave it a shot and I think I have a way (though I didn't try it because I don't have Python 3.7 on my machine): asyncio eventloop with task that reads input, sleep mainloop for your delaytime, cancel task afterwards. I THINK that input will return back to mainloop but I'm not 100% certain. If that doesn't work I'm pretty much lost, input just blocks everything like a bitch so you can do everything you want with stdin the input won't abort.

I'm working on a script that parses a pdf, then creates a thread on a subreddit with the text from the pdf. My account is too new though, so I'm posting around to get some karma, haha. I started the project to test the idea that since I spend so much time on reddit, what if I ported pdfs into actual submissions/self posts and maybe I can turn reddit from a procrastination tool to a productivity tool as well. 
Haha, great hint. Thanks :)
Thanks, looking forward for the full reply. &amp;#x200B; I can't use PyInstaller, because it's a plugin for Autodesk Maya. It only accepts .py or .pyc files, but all project files can be decrypted from .pyc into .py with one click in less than a minute. So binary is not a way to protect the code. &amp;#x200B; I don't need to make it 100% unbreakable, neither reversed engineered. I know it's practically impossible with Python. As long as it's easier to just buy it then I'm good. And as long as it's enough to make sure user knows they have to use one license per user. Some may not read the EULA. &amp;#x200B; I was considering using multiple layers of obfuscation for this, mostly obfuscating all variable and class names, and encoding some strings that may give out what the code does. I've seen this used in some of the other plugins (albeit one that heavily uses star imports), and after an hour of trying to figure out where the licensing is hidden (for research purposes) I gave up. It is certainly possible, but clearly too much of a hassle.
Awesome. I've got a few Wii motes and this car looks like the elego rc car kit. Can you share your Arduino code? 
Huh. Thank you! I'll keep doing what I'm doing then, because that's about how I've been doing it, albeit I feel like I'm progressing too slowly. 
I can in a bit you don't wanna see it tho. 
It's that car kit with some modifications.
&gt;We see that the inner class is called “_3ccb”. This seems pretty fragile since this class name will probably change with every new Facebook build.
Lol, my kid would be ecstatic to know he can use a spare wiimote for this. Ever since building the RC and tweaking it around, he's been all into modding his RC, and uses a spare phone I have to control it. Takes the most care of the car than any other RC he's got. Looking forward to the code. Thanks. 
It might be so. The main goal here is to show how easy it could be to automate your daily tasks
Where were you last Monday? Thanks!
I did something similar for rental houses here in Aus. It goes through 3 pages of the website opening each property and looking for a keyword. In my case 'boards' as we want a place with Floor Boards. If any one is interested in the code PM me.

The idea of concurrency described here is kinda wrong. It's more so that the start and end times overlap rather then it being start end start end start end. https://stackoverflow.com/a/24684037/
Because they’re different concepts. Parallelism is about doing the same thing multiple times at once while concurrency is about doing different things at the same time. Think of clearing both of yours ears with q-tips simultaneously (parallelism) vs brushing your teeth while sitting on the toilet (concurrency). Different tasks, different techniques. 
For one you can have thousands of asyncio coroutines running at a time. While you only have a limited number of cores. Secondly, there is a significant cost in pickling and unpicking data when using multiple cores, which is equivalent to multiprocessing in python. In some cases this cost is higher than the benefit of using multiple processes 
Browser warning on site ...
There's a Python-specific answer and a general answer to that question. ## Python The Python interpreter, as far as I'm aware, only runs in a single thread, so you'll never get truly parallel execution from a single Python process. There's some work being done on sub-interpreters (see [here](https://lwn.net/Articles/754162/) and [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0554/)), but that's a ways away from where things stand at the moment. You can do multiprocessing and threadpools or something like that in Python today, but, in my opinion, `asyncio` is simpler, though that's because the documentation and the standard library has seen a huge improvement in the last few releases. ## General Parallelism is like having multiple workers each focusing on their own task, whereas concurrency is like one worker juggling several ongoing tasks (keeping in mind that a computer is much better at multitasking than we are). In parallel-world, if a worker's task requires them to wait, that worker isn't getting anything done, so their time is wasted. In concurrency-world, if a task requires the worker to wait, the worker can switch to a different task. I like to think that concurrency is more about preventing the CPU from sitting around doing nothing, whereas parallelism is more about having independent tasks. That's not to say that you can't have a mixture of both, however. I don't think it's unheard of for an asynchronous program to run multithreaded, where one main thread does the scheduling, and a bunch of worker threads each acts like one of the juggling workers I mentioned above.
They are not "one or another". If you want to maximize the value of your hardware, you would use multiple cores and each will run concurrent tasks. (Also multiple [virtual] machines, multiple data centers, cloud providers...) If you have just one request per core - this will essentially bound you for no reason. Your one core got request to save something to the database and now it's waiting for the response of the database. It's waste of resource. It could've processed other requests while waiting, etc.
If you're using an IDE such as PyCharm, you can change which version is going to be used for each project. 
That's very true. Thank you for that. I needed to hear it. 
Pretty sure you can do some jobs for people abroad in freelancer.com I have no idea how it works or anything, just heard it being mentioned once in a thread about the same thing. I'd give it a whirl tho
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/341184/can-i-install-python-3-x-and-2-x-on-the-same-windows-computer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/341184/can-i-install-python-3-x-and-2-x-on-the-same-windows-computer) I'm not sure which OS your running, but here's an explanation for Windows. Both Linux and OSX come with Python2, if you install Python3, simply need to make sure you call the correct interpreter. On Linux you can call Python 2 with just 'python' and Python 3 with 'python3'. Also, shebangs can be used to make sure any code you right is utilizing the correct interpreter.

No. Global variables should have truly global state. Stuff like database connections probably shouldn't be global. However, DI is a much more minimal concern in Python since any usable object is far easier to mock in testing.
&gt; The Python interpreter, as far as I'm aware, only runs in a single thread It can run with multiple threads, it just have GIL (global interpreter lock), which prevents python bytecodes to be executed in parallel. The biggest reason is - python memory model is not thread safe. But - it doesn't mean there is no benefit in running multiple thread, you still get all the benefits as long as you don't just have pure python code. One thread can wait on IO, like reading the file or sending something to the database, while other will run.
I'm on Win10. I think I ignored that link because it was older. I was looking at this one and there were just a lot of answers that all seemed different. But your explanation for Linux kind of clarified it for me. Basically it's py -2 &amp; py -3 for Windows. Thanks!
I'm using an older version of Komodo 10.1 and it doesn't like when I try switching to the Py3 interpreter. I'd use PyCharm but I need to have a multi-language IDE.

There are some nice primitives in [https://github.com/python-trio/trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) that help a lot when doing concurrent programming
The reason for it is that those are two different things, but often mixed together. Almost all of concurrency problems can be solved through multi threading or even multi processing, but if you solve concurrency problem through concurrency, you actually have lower overhead (no context switching). 
You can make a decorator that! [Here](https://github.com/kyoto-u-shinobi/yozakura_raspi/blob/develop/common/functions.py#L53) is one I've written and used before. Just change the error type to something common, and don't forget the imports. It works by setting an interval timer (in this case, real time, as opposed to processing time), and raising a `SIGALRM` if the timer passes. (If the function returns, it cancels the timer.) There's no need to use asyncio or setting anything else up. from helpers import interrupted @interrupted(0.2) # 200 ms def fancy_input(): '''Do boring things.''' What it does is
I have no idea. I was just guessing. I don't mess with RC anything, so thanks for the input.

What do you mean by "reverse shell"?
Right, which is why I said that the *interpreter* only runs in a single thread.
Because you can't benefit from multiple cores in Python. In fact your kernel might punish you for that because of its scheduler thinking it can do that but the process says no. Dave Beazley has an interesting talk that touches on this (I can't for the life of me remember what it's called though). Iirc he ended up locking one of his cores and saw a performance boost from threaded python.

This is nice and useful starting point, but for others be aware that asyncio was meant to be low level. It was meant to provide a concurrency framework and end users generally would use other libraries on top of it. For example if you want to create an async web server you can use aiohttp (yes the package is both client and server), to access Postgres you can use asyncpg and so on. Eventually everything kind of works asynchronously and you don't even have to think about besides to remembering to put await for calls that are blocking. There are also other async modules, for example: https://github.com/aio-libs (of course this doesn't contain all of them) Using async directly is kind of like using threading module instead of concurrent.futures.

Oh no I'm really just interested in the astronomy side. I like that I could potentially do things related to space with python. Even if it's just stitching photos together lol. I leave the rockets to the geniuses.
Try adding the tab to the tab widget AFTER you add the table to the tab?
As far as I can tell, it is basically solely because OS threads that use the C stack require ~8MB of memory each for their stacks, and simply put, you'll run out of memory if you have too many of them, and will have a lot of cache misses even if you just have a modest amount. Otherwise you would indeed just make a pool of ten thousand threads and just grab the next free one. For all the arguments around it, I'm pretty sure this is all it comes down to.
Just started a a CS class after doing a political science degree. I love it. My first program worked okay, v basic stuff (super simple calculator). It was just... fun to write. 
virtualenv maintains clean, custom development environments for either 2 or 3 or both. There are all sorts of fancy wrapper tools, but some of those just confuse things, since virtualenv got pulled into python’s standard library in version 3.3. This is a good discussion in r/learnpython : https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/4hsudz/pyvenv_vs_virtualenv 
&gt; The Python interpreter, as far as I'm aware, only runs in a single thread, so you'll never get truly parallel execution from a single Python process Right, but you were still wrong in your conclusion &gt; The Python interpreter, as far as I'm aware, only runs in a single thread, perfectly true and precise in every sense &gt; so you'll never get truly parallel execution from a single Python process Completely false. Just call `np.dot` on a big matrix and watch all your cores fire up. A lot of code running in a Python process is not actually requiring the interpreter's attention, and so can run in multiple threads with true parallelism just fine.
um. Asyncio isn't parallelism. Thats what the Processing package is Someone please correct me if I am wrong, because this is how I thought it worked: Concurrency is like one chef cooking one recipe at a time. They start a recipe, and follow it through to the end. Parallelism is like have two chefs in the kitchen both cooking at the same time. Asyncio uses coroutines. Its like having 1 chef cooking multiple recipes at the same time. The chef might start by getting the roast ready, but once its in the oven, they switch to the potatoes, once those are boiling, they switch to the vegetabes to saute, then while that is cooking, they open a bottle of wine, oh, but now vegetables are ready, so you take them to the table, oh and now the roast is done, so you take that to the table, and oh the potatoes are done, so you take that to the table. the Coroutines aren't really being worked on at the same time,. the event loop is just putting the work down to go work on something else instead of waiting till something is done. PLEASE PLEASE correct me if I am wrong, because I am very actively working with/learning asyncio.
Thank you for letting me know. :)
So much misunderstanding surrounding all this. 1. Despite the GIL, Python can do parallelism, not just concurrency. The GIL is only held a minority of the time for most code, especially high-performance numerical code and IO-bound code. The latter is more concurrency than parallelism because threads are waiting doing nothing most of the time, so it's not super accurate to say that multiple things are happening in parallel when most of those things are threads doing nothing. 2. More threads than cores is totally fine, for the above reason. A thread doesn't need a core to itself if it's waiting in IO. It can be put to the side and a thread with something to do can run. If there's a free core the first thread will be given one again soon after whatever IO it's waiting on is finished. 3. asyncio is only better than threads because of the overhead of threads. The overhead of threads isn't that large, but doesn't scale to tens of thousands of threads because of memory usage: there is a minimum amount of memory each thread has for its stack even if it isn't using it all. Unlike threads though, it really can only use one core (unless you fire up multiple event loops in different threads). But that's ok, because you're supposed to use it for IO, where most of the time you're waiting for things to happen. asyncio just gives you a way to store the state of something in ordinary local variables whilst you wait on something, with the possibility of lots of these contexts waiting on lots of things, with the first thing to be complete resulting in one of the contexts being resumed. This is exactly like threads except it's like you have only one core and the switching is being handled at the Python language level instead of the OS level, and you know for sure that your code can only switch context when you `await` something. But that happens so often that you basically have to treat your code the same as multi-threaded code in terms of not sharing too much state and all that. I wonder if OSs will make threads cheaper somehow and it will just instantly make asyncio redundant. I'm convinced it only exists because javascript didn't (doesn't?) have threads. And whilst there's a good use case for it now (literally tens of thousands of coroutines that would exhaust memory if they were threads), I'm not convinced that's why it was made.
Both file IO and most numpy operations are suitable for multi-threading (instead of multi-process) because both will release the GIL while running.
So, the current code is okay? &amp;#x200B;

Pffft, people are just people. Given that "rocket scientists" are far more prevelant than astrophysicists, they have more of the genius vibe in my mind. You don't get to be a practicing astrophysicist or even astronomer by accident really, where my time at NASA has shown that almost any kind of engineer can work almost anywhere across the industry based on experience.
yeah software pwm is pretty bad
Debugging code written using Twisted and experiencing firsthand the joy of not having straightforward paths of execution (especially in the dynamically typed world where many problems are caught at runtime that would be caught earlier in a static type system) basically convinced me several years ago that the whole concept of asyncronous programming was an absolutely terrible idea and that it would be better to do what, say, Haskell does and just write a language runtime that lets you create threads with super low overhead.
Weird I just browsed to this site like an hr ago
I should have fixed it right now. Thank you!

This SO link should get you on the right track [Unpivot Pandas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23354124/how-can-i-unpivot-specific-columns-from-a-pandas-dataframe) 
You can avoid some of the issue by having a function to check the modification time of the file and only reading the file if that has changed. 
This is where a database of some sort comes in. Postgresql, Mysql, nosql, etc. have worked for many people. 
The tables are in "wide" and "long" format, respectively. So searching for "pandas wide to long" might help; alternatively, this is known as "melting" a table so looking at the pandas.melt function should help.
Right I’m aware of those, but is it possible to do something similar with just a text file?
Would that check be in a infinite while loop though? Because I need the information to be updated real-time throughout all of the instances of the program that are open, which is 7 computer max worst case scenario 
Basically you would need to know enough to program your own database system. Which you probably (and most people) don't have an intimate enough understanding of locking principles to do safely. Don't try to reinvent a database (even if it's just a single table one, which is what this would be), use one instead.
asyncio consists of an [event loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) and functions/classes for working with it. The event loop is the core of it. For asyncio specifically how the event loop is implemented depends on the platform and what you select at runtime. You can see the implementations available and the default platforms [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#event-loop-implementations). The selector event loop [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6fe9c446f8302553952f63fc6d96be4dfa48ceba/Lib/asyncio/selector_events.py) corresponds to the description in the [File Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop#File_interface) section of the wiki page above. In CPython the event loop logic is mostly implemented in Python - only the code related to tasks/futures seem to be in C.
Yes, infinite loop. If you want to make it a little nicer, put this loop in a separate thread. Otherwise, you will need to mix main logic with this sentinel which may be ugly.
Do you mean something like https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex so you have an interpreter and all the code available in a single file?
If you have to roll your own solution, which /u/netgu already suggested against and I agree with them, why not serialize the data to one pickle file that will be your variable, and have your scripts check against a 'dirty bit' that is only written when the variable has changed. That would propagate your changes in a quick-ish way, disregarding latency issues.

I think you understate some of the advantages of asyncio versus using threads. Threads can be pre-empted at any time which can lead to race conditions which are countered by using locks. This becomes more of a headache to reason when and how to implement locking when working on larger codebases. With asyncio the switching is co-operative and so you intentionally hand over control at the times you choose. Once you are over initial learning curve that comes with switching to using async functions and awaits and coroutines this makes everything a fair bit simpler. 
Interesting, I have never heard of trio before but I'm excited to play with it
Cool! Keep it up.
I enjoyed that tutorial. Have fun!
Given Tableau/Qlik are sourcing the data from...somewhere, could you just access the data source directly? For example, we have Tableau dashboards sourcing data from a MS SQL database. If I needed that data in Python, I’d probably use pyodbc to access the SQL Server from my program. 
I can use Python to access all of the data - and in some instances we’ll do that. But for a lot of the metrics / values we need, it’ll be much easier to automate the extraction of the dashboard than it would be to rebuild the data model and recalculate all of the metrics 
I was going to suggest SQLite. It's perfect for this use case. You can even install an extension in VSCode that lets you easily open and view the contents.
I’ll read into it more - I should’ve added I’m a novice. I think my question is more around what it’s called that I’m actually trying to do. As in - i can find a good example to scrape a table on Wikipedia. But a Tableau or Qlik dashboard doesn’t render like that - it’s more like it’s a visual object of that makes sense
Makes sense
Yooo, nice keep going!

A deadlock in an asyncio application is just one database deadlock away as it would be with any other application, so having to think about non-deterministic concurrency is still a requirement. &amp;#x200B; Threaded applications, especially web applications, are generally written in shared nothing style within a process and programmers don't typically have to think about thread concurrency on a regular basis. I can write a WSGI application and not think about threads at all, and drop it right into a mod\_wsgi threadpool without any issue. &amp;#x200B; Cooperative IO-based multitasking also has its own set of surprise gotchas around the area of CPU bound work sneaking in and screwing up other waiters, such as one issue we encounter regularly where MySQL servers abort connections because a loaded down event-based server can't respond to its authentication challenge within the default ten second window because other coroutines are doing too much CPU work. We have to "reason" about event-based concurrency problems all the time here and IMO they are no less intellectually intensive than thread-based ones.
Conda has grown to become pretty much a one-stop shop for installing pre-compiled data science-related things. Handling sort-of-isolated environments, project-scoped binaries, reproducible builds and so on is helpful to everyone. Guy I work with does a lot of java/ imageJ stuff using conda.
\+1. Good luck and have fun!
It depends on the book as I alternate the artist I use. For this one, I used Varya Kolesnikova who also did the cover for my **Python 201: Intermediate Python** book. You can see more of her work here: https://www.behance.net/paskamarja
You can do it!
PM me after the Kickstarter is over and I'll see what I can do
"but it works" - that was the hardest lesson of my freelance career to learn. I was obsessed with "good looking' code. I missed a few deadlines. Finally, to push a solution, I delivered the worst looking shit I've ever made. It's been flawless in production for years now. 
what! everybody does!
well that would be interesting
IMHO async and threads are all fine so long as your threads don't share data except via message passing. As soon as I adopted that model (which I got some practice at playing [spacechem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/)) for all of my code, I had to worry very little about all the stuff that used to be a nightmare.
lol. i love this. 
His criticisms of asyncio are enlightening: https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/
Do they have access to the code? Do they care how bad it looks? I feel like really elegant code is great for long-term projects that will be updated, but one-off things don't need to be elegant. Is this at all true?
How did you learn?
check out format strings if you're on v3.6+ f'This is {myvar}'
Don’t need to always google. Start by reading the messages.
I dunno, let's ship this idea and see if it works Jokes aside that's the idea I've been running with at least
It seems to be reliable across kernels and it is common practice. I don't know of other ways to get the raw data, except maybe with dbus. It is usually simpler to fetch these values straight from the file system. It is also what I've done: https://gitlab.com/william.belanger/obsuite/blob/master/obsuite/frontend/battery.py
As another 40-ish guy also muddling my way through learning python, I applaud your achievement. I swing between thinking I'm a genius and thinking that I don't know even the basics. 
My high school students did a project like this... ... after 5-6 months of coding lessons. Not &lt; one month and a few hours of video lessons. In other words - ROCK ON! Done and working is always better than pretty and still not done. 
In my opinion you should still use `"This is {myvar}".format(myvar=myvar)` as it's not supported in 3.5.2 which is still quite common in production environments.
Conda is an installer, not just a python package installer. It can also install different versions of python.
My employer is huge and is already working on standardizing 3.7.1
Awesome work dude. I Just started on my Python Journey too.
depends on who you're working for. Most people don't really care about the code under the hood, they just want their app to work. If you're contracting and working with other developers, then it probably will matter a bit more. Nothing ever really needs to be elegant, just readable, usually but not always the same thing.
&gt; Finally, to push a solution, I delivered the worst looking shit I've ever made. It's been flawless in production for years now. Are you my coworker? You should really just tell them you need more time. God forbid someone else need to maintain your code. I spend **way** too much time trying to untangle my other developer's undercooked spaghetti code. At the very least *comment* your code appropriately.
This is true. It's not something you want to flaunt but tons of projects have little one off scripts and migrations and cronjobs that look funky. It really depends on your review process works at your job. If it's shit, then a lot of shit code will get through, both one offs and a million offs. If you have anal retentive reviewers, you might get shit for nasty looking one off scripts, but people are far more likely to allow that through if it's clear it's just a one off, 100 lines that probably won't ever change. You're correct though, long term projects and code that will need continued maintenance is best if it's held to higher standards, but it's a factor of many things like whether it affects customers if it breaks, whether it affects the security of the business, whether it touches confidential data and how confidential it is, what the worst cases are... the scarier it is if the code breaks, the cleaner it should be IMO.
Or you could just use virtual environments with your projects so that you can use whatever version you want. Or PyInstalller to make it all a single executable and include the Python with it.
Only need one variable here: guess\_char = len(guess\_word) guess\_len = guess\_char
Congrats!!
Looks good, but it's time to learn about writing your own functions! Think of logical parts of this problem that it can be divided into. There's several elements I can imagine: 1. seeing how many characters are the same, which might look like `def count_similar(user_guess, answer):` 2. seeing how many characters are placed in the right spot, like `def count_correctly_placed(user_guess, answer):` then you might want to check out the format function (or format strings if python 3.6+), like `"you have {} good letters, and {} correctly placed".format(good_count, correct_count)` The main thing is I'd divide this up into functions that make it easier to read, so you can easily test the program by opening a python shell and typing something like `count_correctly_placed("foobar", "fizbaz")`
Kudos! Very happy to see your efforts paid off. Next step is to continue improving your code, start contributing open source projects, start with small fixes, typos, reading style guides, etc.
Uhhhh, no. Not unless you're making a library you intend for use by other people where you have no control over what version of Python they're using (within reason, i.e. I would not bother with supporting Python 2 since it's EOL is less than a year away). If you're avoiding using f strings because your prod environment doesn't have 3.6+ then the solution is to upgrade your prod environment, not to bind yourself to an old version of Python. Upgrading to 3.6+ should be relatively painless, and would require no code changes since they've maintained backwards compatibility.
Thanks, will definitely look it up!

Mind sharing? I'm thinking about doing something similar!
I will make note of that, thanks!
Format is very slow. f-strings are way faster. come to the future!
Can't think of a situation where I would use integer keys, especially since [JSON only allows string key values](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8758771). In your case you want to do this &gt;&gt;&gt; a=1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b={} &gt;&gt;&gt; b[a] = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; b[a].append('f') &amp;#x200B;
Just a suggestion for better code. Instead of doing this: ``` word = getpass("Enter the secret word :") word = (word.lower()) ``` do ``` word = getpass("Enter the secret word :").lower() ```
Docker ftw. 
Cool, thank you
Congrats! one thing I'll suggest is get in the habit of Commenting your code, one day you might look back on this or something else you write to fix it, update it, etc and may or may not have any clue what you were trying to do or why you did something a certain way. It will also help anyone else who comes along and wants to use your code but maybe not read through the whole thing. 
... the attitude of every creative person, ever. XD Good job doing it, you only fail if you do nothing. :) 
Rewrote your code, compare it to your own step by step and ask any questions you have! from getpass import getpass # Create functions for everything that made repetition in code def ask_input(message, validations=[], secret=False): # By default "method" is input method = input # If "secret" is set to True, use getpass instead of input if secret: method = getpass # Set text to empty string text = "" # Run while text is empty while not text: # Ask user to input text via input/getpass text = method(message) # Run each validation function for val_func, error_msg in validations: # Print error message for each failing validation function if not val_func(text): print(error_msg) # Return word and the length of it return text, len(text) def compare_correctly_placed(word_a, word_b): # Example: # # word_a = "sad" # word_b = "asd" # # zip(word_a, word_b) # -&gt; [("s", "a"), ("a", "s"), ("d", "d")] # # [ char_a # for char_a, char_b # in zip(word_a, word_b) ] # -&gt; ["s", "a", "d"] # # [ char_a # for char_a, char_b # in zip(word_a, word_b) # if char_a == char_b ] # -&gt; ["d"] # Return length of correctly placed characters return len( [ char_a for char_a, char_b in zip(word_a, word_b) if char_a == char_b ]) # Validation functions and error messages for them word_validations = [ ( lambda text: len(text) &gt; 0, "You have entered nothing, please try again" ) ] # Ask input with validations and secret set to true word, word_len = ask_input( "Enter the secret word: ", validations=word_validations, secret=True) # Lowercase input and get set of characters word = word.lower() word_set = set(word) # Initialize guess word and counter of tries guess_word = "" counter = 0 # Game loop while guess_word != word: # Increase counter counter += 1 # Ask guess input with validations and secret=False guess, guess_len = ask_input( "What is the secret word?

You have guessed the word correctly") break 
Ah, never tested the speed. I don't need it often, only for some small projects.
That must be nice. We just use python for scripting (I'm an SRE) and trying to get our team to use even python3.4 is like pulling teeth. 
Awesome that you teach python to HS kids! what's the course?
Start: Creating native libraries for Python in Haskell
Great start! There's a lot of stuff you can simplify in here, but that will come with more practice and learning. Your projects will only get better and better. 
Nice work!
Yeah, Python can be your tool in this endeavor. Check out r/learnpython for information on how to get going. (read their sidebar)
Dumb question, but can’t multiple threads run on multiple cores concurrently?
Your python code (at least as copied here) is not indented properly.

Will definitely have to read that tomorrow. I've heard a lot about how asyncio is not intuitive, nor easy to use, though
People like you are a true inspiration to the whole community of beginners (which includes me).
It is not easy to use. You forget "await" in one place, and without any complaints it just doesn't work. Or you're wondering why things are busted only to realize an exception is thrown somewhere, and there's nobody to print its stack trace. But when everything is done correctly the code is easy to read. I wrote a bittorrent client in asyncio and it was kind of fun.
Cool! Now after each guess attempt, displayt the word to the user and only show the letters that are in the correct place! like hangman!
Came here to say this. OP if you're on python3.6+ and haven't checked out f-strings yet, definitely do so! The readability gains is a bonus too.
Can you mention some stuff I should be paying attention to when I write my code? This is something I am afraid of, just started to learn at the start of this year. But sometimes I think that as I am a self-thought python programmer I won't learn the high standards for coding as a software engineer. &amp;#x200B;
Can you hide the code source and just let the end user use the end product with python? Just started to learn and I have just been using the IDLE and it looks that the only way to run the code is by having the code 
I switched careers to software engineering — I’m 3 years in and have “senior” in my title, and I still feel this way. Keep it up!
Unfortunately I can't as it's company property

Looks interesting one the reason I start to learn python is to manage data and visualization. What do you mean by interactive stuff?
Eh Grisham didn't write any books until his late 40s
What’s sos special about them??
The sidebar at /r/learnpython 
Ty sir looks like it has good reviews I'll check it out. Btw I was using c++ programming by ds Malik and liked that book a lot 
I was obsessed too because there is so much stress on it it seems. I think people should always be aware of writing clean code but focus more on getting this to work as a beginner. With more experience it starts become more obvious when you are planting a landmine. I think clean code just come.es naturally with time
Congrats. Take a look at various other ways of building up those strings with replacement data in them, without the concatenations. That's a small domain of stuff you could learn about, using what you already have here. 
It's really language specific. But general principles are pretty universal. Minimize unnecessary variables (goes for science too), use as simple algorithms as possible where optimized performance isn't an issue, document everything, and write your code like you'll be the one who has to come rewrite it in 10 years. Ambiguous, difficult to follow code will be such a headache later, yet avoiding it takes so little time in the immediate sense. 
They're concise and easy to parse. Don't have to shift your eyes back and forth (situational).
Is this another shit coin? We already have bitcoin friend!
I just started learning python and one of the future chapters is on web scraping. From the examples I have seen you have to assign a website but I was wondering if what you are doing is searching on the web for any website (like a google search) that post "deals on steam" or do you still need to assign a website so you are only waiting for an alert from your favorite websites?
TIL: You can &amp; sets together. Is this valid for lists and tuples as well?
These types of small exercises are exactly what you need to become an expert. Here are some pointers that should help a lot * Learn about types, and be able to identify what type each variable is going to be * Learn about explicit and implicit type casting, this can save you time, space and avoid hard to notice bugs. # For instance you have name = "John" # type is 'str' print("hello " + str(name)) # Prints 'hello John' # But 'name' is already a str, you don't need to be explicit print("hello " + name) # Also prints 'hello John' # But what about this implicit thing? print(3) # prints '3', print automatically converts to a string # It gets weird too print(True + True + False) # prints '2' * Finally is that you need to be *very* mindful of when you write and overwrite a variable. In your code `word` is a variable containing the secret word, so it probably shouldn't be changed. However, you have this code: ... elif guess_char &gt; word_char: dif = guess_char - word_char word_char = guess_char for add_letters in range(dif): word = word + str(add_letters) ... Now, `range(dif)` returns a list of `int`, so `add_letters` is an `int`. because you *explicitly* cast `add_letters` to `str` it actually modifies the secret word! Try testing by setting the secret word to "hello". Then input "hellop", and solve the puzzle with "hello0" * Final point: Try out an interpreter for python! Mess around, see what happens. It's very useful for learning. My version of the code, trying to keep the original flow, but using some more advanced concepts: from getpass import getpass word = getpass("Enter the secret word :").lower() guess = '' count = 0 while guess != word: count += 1 print('') guess = input('What is the secret word? ').lower() num_same_char = len(set(guess) &amp; set(word)) # Below is a list comprehension, don't worry about this for a bit are_letters_same = [g==w for g,w in zip(guess, word)] ok_letters = sum(are_letters_same) # implicit bool to int if guess == word: break # String formatting, you can also use .format print("This is try # %d"%count) if len(guess) == 0: print("You have entered nothing, please try again") continue # Notice how moving the redundant prints simplifies this? if len(guess) &lt; len(word): print("Not enough characters in your guess") elif len(guess) &gt; len(word): print("Too many characters in your guess") else: print("You have the exact number of characters in your guess") print("You have %d good letter(s)"%num_same_char) print("You have %d letter(s) correctly placed."%ok_letters) print("Congratulations!!! You have guessed the word correctly") 
Not sure if lambdas are a good idea to teach to someone 2 weeks into programming. Might be a little too advanced.
Nice

There might also be the option to emulate the middle mouse button by configuring the mouse such that a simultaneous click on the left and right mouse button results in a middle mouse button click. I don't know about Windows and Mac OS, but on Linux this can certainly be done.
Someone may have mentioned it but anyway, I recommend going through all the python track on exercism.io
No, this only works for sets and frozensets. `set('ab') &amp; set('bc')` is [equivalent](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.intersection) to `set('ab').intersection(set('bc'))`. Also check out its siblings `|` (union), `-` (set difference), and `^` (symmetric difference) :-)

Python 3-compatible factorial one-liner: `f=lambda x:z if x&lt;0else(1if 0&lt;=x&lt;1else x*f(x-1))` Note that the previous one &gt;!returns an error if 0 is entered and uses `reduce`!&lt;.
Pretty cool!
Thanks. But where is the "z" coming from?
A lame way to return an error.
🎉🎉🎉 it will get better over time !
If you don't mind my asking, I've had to write a number of scripts as an administrator that ended up living for far longer than expected. I had usually just run with the idea that if I couldn't succinctly describe what several lines of code was doing in a sentence, then I probably wasn't writing clear enough code. Was I on the write track, pun intended?
python for HS kids is the course,duh
It took some 16-18 year olds 5 to 6 months to write something equivalent to this? What? How? How could you possibly take up 5-6 MONTHS worth of teaching to just teach them this? Dear god. You are why I continuously vote against increasing teacher pay.
R u high dude?
Thank you so much for this. I was in a dead end, cause I wanted to use GraphQL on two of my projects, but also I wanted to use python because of its robust utils (sqlalchemy, flask etc). I was in a dead end with that decision because the only option was graphene, and I had numerous issues with Graphene and its cumbersome api. Glad to found ariadni. I will participate in ariadni's development as much as I can.
You need an objective, what are you trying to achieve
Should be titled how to speed up your I/O bound program with concurrency. Article says doing it with a CPU bound program will actually slow it down.
Good on you dude. I picked it up late as a hobby. 7 years on and that's not a lot I can't do (except for crazy cpu intensive stuff... gotta use the right tool for the job). Just don't get too addicted!!!
