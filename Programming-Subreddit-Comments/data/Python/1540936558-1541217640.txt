Great job on JRE! Loved the episode!
&gt; regardless of the size of the data There is no size agnostic "best" solution, your delightfull quick-sort solution bucket distributed sorting solution will be much slower if you have 10 datapoints to sort. This is the reason big O notation ignores size and looks at asymptotics. +1 your response. I've had good experiences applying for job at companies that require or need software for their day-to-day operations vs a 'software' company that tries to licence its product. In my experience, the former is more in touch with the parts of software that actually has impact.
Python 3.3 to 3.4 removed a number of features and 3.8 will be renaming a number of library function arguments. There were probably other this was just things I remember.

No, even unsorted data can be sorted faster than log n if you know anything about the data set.
Yes, poetry por favor
The future is here
Thanks, that would be great! 
Honestly, I think it's a bad interview question. I also think that your answer is correct; using the standard library with its optimized C implementations is going to be faster in most cases. It sounds like you knew your Python better than the interviewer. Ultimately, if you're interviewing somewhere, you are stuck at the whims of their interviewers and interview process. Personally, I would take their response to your answers as pretty strong signal that I would not want to work at their company. Pay them no heed and find a better place to work.
My take on this is that it sounds like a meta question. If someone comes to me with a prescribed solution, I first would try to figure out why that is what they want. Will this employee ask for details? Why the for loops? What are the data your'e looking for anwyway? Are we sure the bottleneck is the sorting function? etc. etc.
People don't like this answer, but it's almost certainly what the discussion was during the wrap-up.
Superlatives are tricky, but a variant of this that works pretty well is to ask about something challenging they have worked on recently.
Am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and have Pip 8.1.1 installed. Have ‘t tried anything yet as didn’t want to have to uninstall if ‘auto’ installed the wrong version.
Hmm [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. 
Some people like to reinvent the wheel. They wind up with a lot of wasted time and a lopsided car...
He was interviewing as a senior engineer, and for a position to optimize their code. I don't think the question was appropriate for his position nor the job
But OP has evidenced why the question needed to be asked. They were either checking to see if OP understood how the built in functioned worked or to see how he thinks or to just check he could code (companies gef a lot of "impressive" resumes but don't actually have anywhere need the skills claimed). OP evidenced that given a simple task he will argue the toss and not evidence he can do it. The weeded him out quite effectively. With a "simple" question.
Depends on how the question was prompted. If the response to suggesting `b = list(set(a1).union(set(a2)); b.sort()` was to say (as op suggests) that it's not good enough because it's slower than a for loop, then I'm inclined to think this wasn't a case where they were trying to see how op thinks but rather looking for a "right" answer to a trivia problem. If the response, instead, were to say, "that's a great solution but we're looking to get a sense for how you solve problems so lets pretend you don't have access to the `sort` or `set` builtins?" then I'd suspect this was about how op thinks.
Wait is export=0 supposed to be a keyword arg in pd.read_csv? Because I’m expectedly getting “parser_f() got an unexpected keyword argument ‘export’” exception...
Python all the way! I teach Python to middle and high school students and am so glad I chose Python over Java - it's just far easier to learn the basics and there is quite a lot you can do with it (easily) out of the box. I've posted all the videos I made for my students on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vm-0XX5RkWCXWwtBZGOXg). Since you're just getting started with Python, I'd start with this one: [Basic Python 3 for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxSyXBq9zq0&amp;list=PLlEgNdBJEO-nQkFDah-gm6UX7CI6rCdB-). Welcome to the wonderful world of Python!
&gt; That said, I can’t imagine a reason to ever rewrite core library functions. If you have a performance critical piece and you can specialize the sort algo to *your* use case *and* that's a bottleneck, then go ahead and rewrite it *if* you know what you're doing. That said, I question the value of doing that vs writing some C that "eh, good enough" especially because Timsort is generally performant enough. 
for the record, python's sort function is an adaptive in-place merge sort the fastest way to merge two lists is sorted(a+b), as a result
If I were there interviewer this would be a good answer. Though I usually like asking about something the person is especially proud of because it gives me insight into what motivates them and usually people are proud of working through difficult tasks.
I'd rather discuss architecture, working with legacy and the compromises made with it than discuss algos for a position that'll be 90% webdev with maybe 9.99% queue workers that are essentially the same as the web work just outside the request-response cycle and .01% interesting stuff. Currently the most interesting thing we've built is an Either type in C#.
you're looking for heapq.merge(): [https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
These aren't time series, they're just different. This seems like a linear programming problem but I can't quite tell based on your description. 
First course, I'd suggest pycharm. It's slower, but also has a lot more inspections that make code writing a breeze.
I don't get it. Explain?
I think others have covered the technical justifications for you. But just to give a slightly different perspective that might make you feel better about it... Interviews are a two-way street: and on this occasion, *they* failed your interview.

It's possible they needed someone to do that. However it's far more likely that they just weren't qualified to interview people for the position they needed.
I apologize I didn’t realize this was the wrong sub. Thanks for the help!
Wouldn't even need to sort since they're already sorted-- just merge two lists with some logic to prevent duplicates.
I still don't really understand what it is. Do I have to run something? Is it a python library for writing data to a file?

Actually I got the idea after reading that for all job search sites, no one actually reads your resume. Websites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter have automated systems to sort through resumes. Also, their job postings are pulled from all over the internet, most of the time without permission. I figured if they're going to do it, so should I. As for your first question, there are many approaches to doing this. You could just scrape all job boards including Kijiji and Craigslist and just email your resume. You can narrow it down using keyword searches and tailor the email depending on the job. I haven't decided yet
You can conjure a sort algorithm that folds to domain specific knowledge. I've been surprised with all the dogma of 'use built-ins' only to find that yes, built-ins are fast for python in general application but with domain specific knowledge you can get crafty'er. 
sounds like you just had an interview with Google... 
`heapq` does operations on lists, so you'd lose any of the advantages of streaming iterators (especially memory use).
Always been a fan of BBEdit. Been using it since Mac Pro days. 
Python is very close to pseudo code, arguably.
I always enjoy breaking things (well, revealing that they're broken) with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/). You either laugh or you cry... For example, try evaluating `"(" * 93 + ")" * 93 == ()` in the Python repl. Then try with `94`.
Leading with "no you are wrong" is basically just flopping your dick on the table. If you're interested in reaching consensus - it isn't what you lead with. If you're trying to work *with* someone you explain what you think and why. You ask questions to see what they think. Sometimes you'll find out that you misunderstood what they meant. Often you'll find out that they were wrong, but that that it wasn't really important to their main point/goal, and you can let the error slide. Sometimes it will turn out they really were just wrong but at least this gives them an opportunity to back down gracefully. Senior devs don't suddenly stop needing basic interpersonal skills.
I hate these kind of bullshit questions. I think everyone should say this is fucking bullshit and walk out when you get these kind of questions and you aren't 12
I don't understand it when companies resort to these types of "SAT" questions in tech screens. Give a small, time bound task relevant to the actual job, if the work product meets your predefined standard, have a follow on interview where they explain the work. This not only saves time (you don't need to waste time interviewing bad candidates) but gives a way better picture of how a candidate will - from a technical standpoint - meet muster. Nothing worse than screening candidates who have good brains, deep knowledge of your business domain, but aren't good at mini quizzes that only very indirectly assess skills. At that point, you're just screening to preserve an internal monoculture.
Well, yeah. I mentioned mergesort only because it contains a similar algorithm already and I'm too lazy to actually describe the answer.
I'll second that u/thelostcreator if you're *only* going to be using Python for the foreseeable future you should use a Python IDE; PyCharm is probably the best. Otherwise, it's not a bad idea to become familiar with a decent multi-platform text-editor such as Atom or Sublime early on. 
Sometimes in a niche, when you have particular data that can be massaged in particular ways very efficiently because of its nature, you can write a manual algorithm that is more efficient. There is an easy way to test when you're in this situation: your code is already slow and you can write some empirical test cases to show a manual algorithm will make a significant difference to runtime. However these generally don't come up very often. Python is in fact famous for getting one of the fastest empirical stable sorts around, timsort. Was made by a genius called Tim who worked at Google at the time. 
Thanks! 
Python's builtins use Timsort, which is O(n log n) average, but for this kind of mostly-sorted data it should be pretty much O(n).
Did you read the docs? They specifically say the opposite for this function. 
Doesn't remove duplicates though. 
Does the data fit in memory? Will your line still work if it doesn't? 
This seems really cool. I am not a software guy, but I use python for some data analysis at work, which requires the use of large (&gt;1 GB) .csv files. So, I figured I'd try this out.

It’s obvious why, right?
&gt; If the response to suggesting &gt; b = list(set(a1).union(set(a2)); b.sort() &gt; was to say (as op suggests) that it's not good enough because it's slower than a for loop, then I'm inclined to think this wasn't a case where they were trying to see how op thinks but rather looking for a "right" answer to a trivia problem. It is slower in the sense of computational complexity. He was supposed to provide a linear solution.
I was about to comment the same thing 
&gt; Why? You have to code it in Python because a "for loop is faster" than the sort routine ... ahem? Excuse me? He meant in terms of computational complexity. The "for loop" is linear time. Your solution is linearithmic. Since the input arrays are already sorted, you were supposed to produce the merge from merge sort. &gt; I finally wrote the blasted thing in two loops with an index per array sorting in an array dynamically This is quadratic time, which is even worse than your linearithmic solution. &gt; How many of you really think it's a good idea to rework the python library functions? He is testing your knowledge of algorithms and computational complexity, which you presumably studied in school. This is standard at software engineering interviews. Find a good algorithms book and read it to prepare for the next one. &gt; Coding for the milliseconds matter imho in real time systems or web transactions requiring a timely response - probably would use a different system like node but not python. Computational complexity matters even in Python. Maybe it doesn't matter as much as it did twenty years ago, but it comes up enough that you should be able to produce the most efficient algorithm for these kinds of problems. Also, I agree that you're being overly defensive. It happens to everyone. Don't beat yourself up over it. Don't expect this kind of question to disappear soon. You need to relearn this stuff.
Because that has worse computational complexity than the best solution.
&gt; Honestly, senior dev shouldn't be asked questions like this at all. How can junior developers respect a senior developer who can't answer these questions? Many of them won't.
His response is asymtotically worse than the best solution.
A lot of other people have mentioned that you were really being examined on your problem-solving and algorithm skills, not your general coding skills. Beyond that though, it seems like you missed a pretty important part of the solution: the standard library's sort is O(*n* log *n*), whereas this is simply an array merge, and is O(*n*). That's why it should be faster (*much* faster, even when compared to the c-implemented `sort` routine). Not realising that (or, if you did realise it, not mentioning it to the interviewers) may have had a significant part to play in you not getting the job. Here's a quick solution I hacked together: def merge_sorted(xs, ys): res = [] xs_i, ys_i = iter(xs), iter(ys) x, y = next(xs_i, None), next(ys_i, None) while x is not None and y is not None: if x &lt; y: res.append(x) x = next(xs_i, None) elif y &lt; x: res.append(y) y = next(ys_i, None) else: res.append(x) x, y = next(xs_i, None), next(ys_i, None) if x is not None: res.append(x) if y is not None: res.append(y) res += xs_i res += ys_i return res This version is indeed faster than yours at larger sizes. I started to see a difference around 10,000 elements. Here's my testing code: def merge_sorted_2(a1, a2): b = list(set(a1).union(set(a2))) b.sort() return b from random import randrange len = 10000 xs = sorted(list(set(randrange(len * len) for _ in range(len)))) ys = sorted(list(set(randrange(len * len) for _ in range(len)))) import timeit print(1, timeit.timeit('merge_sorted(xs, ys)', number=500, globals=globals())) print(2, timeit.timeit('merge_sorted_2(xs, ys)', number=500, globals=globals()))

If you use quicksort you will take O(nlogn) which is not an acceptable O in this scenario.
If the input arrays are sorted, as you said in the description only when you got to their objections to hashing, the problem can be accomplished in O(n) time with a single loop. Any solution which sorts is O(n log(n)) at best. Sounds like you may want to pay more attention to the problem description - usually if they give you something like sorted input, it's very relevant to the solution.
It’s a python specific request, that’s why I posted here. 
I went through your post history. Try running `python3 submission-limiter.py`
Alrighty then, this might be a bit more difficult than I anticipated. I'll PM you.
Thank you
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. I couldn't find anything with "Python security mailing list", and I'm not sure where to go from there.
I was literally in a python interview last week, asked the exact same question, and gave a merge/sort solution using built-in functions. The interviewer had the same reaction and slowly coerced me into writing two for loops. I too was salty during this part but I saw their point, they simply wanted a step by step approach and probably wanted to see how I thought through the solution. The kicker came on question two. Something along the lines of summing all the odd integers in a given list of integers. Taking what I learned from question one, I opted for writing a couple gross looking for loops to check for oddity and add to a running total. The interviewer didn’t like that. They said “why don’t you do a list comprehension?”. I politely responded and explained I was sticking with the theme of the previous solution, they then grabbed the marker and wrapped a list comprehension with a built in sum() function. :/
5000 rows isn’t a big deal for any of these packages. Personally I would use pandas because it’s what I am most comfortable with. That said bonobo is a package I want to learn and use. 
I'm aware of this. It's just the shortest way to write the set union method. The fastest method is to append to an intermediate list (see my comment above)
*Pythons out for Harambe*
These are the type of posts that make me realize I am far from having a Python job. lol Although, we probably shouldn't rewrite python funcs. If we do that, then what's the point of having them, or even importing modules for that matter?
I bet you can't build an array of arbitrary elements in a for loop faster than the built in sort can sort it. Append and even setitem are slow.
Might be worth checking out https://github.com/fx-kirin/pyahk , which claims to fork the original from Bitbucket and also says it's Python 3.3+ compatible.
"Fork the original from Bitbucket" I'm sorry I'm new to programming what dose that mean?
Don’t all registrars provide a free DNS service for the domain that you buy. I use Namecheap but Godaddy also has that service.
[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
Or they could have just used timeit to settle the question rather than spend forever speculating.
Yeah but OPs solution destroyed the sortedness of the original data before using timsort

Why this instead of, say, click?
Just curious how this is different than bazel? 
True, but i specifically did not want to use cron job for my use case, because i needed my periodic tasks to be part of my main package. I did not want to run them independently.
Point noted. Will check out kronos. I wanted a lightweight library that was simple to use and had a graceful shutdown mechanism, so i thought i would create my own.
Link farming is spam. By any means, go ahead and report me for pointing out the obvious.
I don't know anything about this field, but I've heard of elastisearch. Is that what you'd recommend? Or just in general saying that a pure python option for something like this is never the winner because speed is a requirement and other things are faster.
I think you did the right thing on one end, and the wrong thing on another. I think the right thing to do is to challenge the interviewer if you feel you are correct. As a senior software engineer, you propose a hypothesis and you provide either facts or personal experience of why it is a bad idea or it's not the right approach. I can say that there would have to be a very specific case when re-writing a built-in python library would make sense. For the most part, it doesn't make sense. Those libraries are open source, they are peer reviewed, tested, and above all, known by the entire community. So re-writing one is not only inefficient time wise, but also will create technical debt when someone else has to own the code. That goes beyond the development and more into the project management, business part of the features. Why re-inventing the wheel? Sort of like implementing your own encryption algorithm. Not a good idea, unless you're the NSA of course!
I was confused as to why anyone would find this offesive xD
I’m new as well. I’ve looked around and found Textwrangler does all the simple things I need and is beginner friendly’s with easy drop-down list to select the highlight and syntax help I need. I downloaded pycharm but I fine it more complex and intended for larger projects. If you go to python dot org and download the Idle (the point a click version of python not already on your Mac) you can create easy .py files. 
I’ve downloaded textwrangler but haven’t downloaded python from the website. Textwrangler still works (I think Mac has an installed version of python already) but should I also download the one from python’s website? Do you know how to change the text editor’s interpreter from the default Mac python to the python one I download from the website?
No don't look specifically for python. Search something like **cyber security vulnerabilities mailing list**. Also twitter has many users and bots you can follow.
I considered this, I'm not sure how much extra time converting to a deque would add, or if it would beat my pop().
A dozen malicious libraries on PyPI per year is far better than what anyone would reasonably expect.
Everyone here is arguing about what whether you got the question "right"... You are incorrectly assuming that you lost the interview based on your answer to this one question. There are many questions and interviews are fairly competitive... someone likely did it better than you and also handled the interviewers questions with better tack than you did... (more nefarious minded they could have also been more junior and had lower expected salary considerations)
If it's an optimization problem then it was clearly an algorithm test. Not to mention merging pre-sorted arrays is a very common problem in mapreduce/distributed big data systems. In fact k-way merge is probably the most fundamental type of reduction you'd be doing. Bonus points for having recognized merge(sort) is homomorphic. There's also an edge case arising from the intermediate value theorem that should be optimized right away (assuming the dataset is fully in memory): if x[-1] &lt;= y[0] then merge(x,y) is simply x.extend(y) (or x.extend(y[1:]) if x[-1] == y[0] to remove the duplicate). Also, it may not help to overthink interviews like this. I was once given the standard departmental salaries aggregation SQL question where I used a join (to find the guy in each department with max salaries by department) whereas they were just looking for a simple group by/having, so it looked like I was being clueless (by answering the wrong question) instead of actually answering a slightly harder/more useful question.
The only difference would be Python two as opposed to three. So open up your terminal and type “python3” to make sure it’s the latest version. If you see an error you might have to download python 3 (please interject If I’m misspeaking) from python dot org. Even if you have the latest version and you go to python dot org and download python you’ll get “idle” which is a kind of terminal/text editor and “python Launcher” which I don’t know much about yet. 
Make a Linux chroot (google it). Setting up an Ubuntu like environment from start to finish is a 2-3 hour process. Once you got Linux setup, you can install whatever python version you want, but most have a standard 2.7 and 3 versions via python, or python3 commands at the terminal.

&gt; How many of you really think it's a good idea to rework the python library functions? Well, some of them are really bad, as in they have bad API for example. Some of them are too slow by design. A lot of popular Python 3rd party libraries exist solely to fix problems with built-in functions. `requests` solves the inadequacies of `urllib`, `sh` solves the bad design of `subprocess`, `setuptools` tries to patch nonsense of `distutils` etc. I, myself, wrote a Base64 decoder/encoder, mostly for fun, but I could make it go about twice as fast as the standard library version. It's neither hard nor unexpected. ---- Specifically for sorting problems, well, there are so many things one could have improved, if they had better knowledge of the data they are working with... It's a whole science into itself. For instance, there are sorting algorithms not based on comparison, which, provided that you are sorting something that is, in principle totally ordered, and you know that certain statistical constraints hold (i.e. that there are very few duplicates), will blow any comparison-based sort out of the water. But then there are problems standard library sort isn't equipped to deal with. For example, your data can be so large, it doesn't fit in memory of a single computer, or it might not fit in the storage of a single computer, and then you will have to write a distributed version of this algorithm. Python doesn't work in parallel, but, perhaps, a merge sort or similar will do better with good implementation of parallelism, for sufficiently large data-sets? ---- Finally, arguing about benefits of for loop vs list comprehension in this respect is idiotic, whichever your favorite is. They are more or less the same. Their performance will fluctuate here or there depending on what machine runs them, under what conditions, version of interpreter etc. It's a meaningless measurement to try to compare them, and is just isn't worth anyone's time, unless you are contributing your code to Python core, and then you are interested in these benchmarks.
Does it has to be Python project? A more mainstream combo for this task would be NodeJs + SocketIO + VPS with Linux. Actually there are some async frameworks for Python, like Tornado. You can try those.
Not quite dead yet. I can run jobs 2x faster than my coworkers computer, which is 2 years older than mine. Fine, you have to flood the 8 cores, but you can do that. &gt; which Python is uniquely unsuited to make use of because of the GIL. i mean you could use PyCuda or CuPy or Cython or numba or C++ or Fortran, etc. Why do you have to do everything with in pure Python? Pure Python isn't fast anyways, so I don't see what the issue is. Also, if it's true concurrency, you can spin off separate processes and collect them when they're done. I started doing that back in 2009.
Yes it has to ru. Flask, which means it needs python
Seriously, no. If the input lists are already sorted, then the standard library solutions which are made for unsorted input are not the best choice if you care about performance at all.
I would recommend watching conference talks and tutorials, especially those by Raymond Hettinger and David Beazely.
Suggest you investigate celery. You might just have fun with it. 
Yes, there are generic sorting algorithms that will show a best case performance of O(n) on already sorted input, but quicksort is not one of them. The good thing about quicksort is that it will always be O(n log n), even on bad input. The bad thing about quicksilver is that it will always be O(n log n), even on good input.
Java is very disappointing at first contact (bad design, tons of bad decisions, awful tools, very obvious split mind over basic concepts of the language), but after couple years working with it, you discover some good sides. In other words, it puts the bar very low from the get go, but then it doesn't disappoint more than that. Python is a different story. Superficially, it's a very nice language, with things working as you'd want them... or so you think... at first. But then, it goes down and down and down. After few years you realize you've been sold a cat in a sac. ---- I mean, no matter which one you choose, you are screwed. Whether you prefer to take the hit up-front or let the delusion linger for a couple years, is a personal preference.
I wouldn't have hired you either based on what I'm reading. Sounds to me like you are scared to think through a simple algorithm/data structure exercise.
Is a form of long polling an option?
I get a SyntaxError either way Python 3.6.6 (default, Jul 19 2018, 14:25:17) [GCC 8.1.1 20180712 (Red Hat 8.1.1-5)] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; eval('(' * 93) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1 ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( ^ SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing &gt;&gt;&gt; eval('(' * 94) s_push: parser stack overflow Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1 (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( ^ SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing &gt;&gt;&gt; 
That's some tough requirements, eh. Well, you can do page updates without refreshing with old and tried techniques like ajax long polling. Web chats, for example, existed long before all those fancy websockets came out. It would be just a little slower and not as scalable as proper async framework, but for a simple study project of some turn-based game it will be fine 
VSCode, Atom if you looking just for editor, if you are looking for something more then pycharm pro or community version
Scalability isn't really an issue, at most I would expect to allow 2-4 players, and it won't part of any sort of marking criteria AFAIK. This is just a high school course, and while I always look to extend myself where I can, nothing even close to this is expected.

I'm no expert on PythonAnywhere, but they seem to be fairly clear that they're set up for short-running WSGI processes, so HTTP request/response only... no threading, no sockets, no server-side multiprocessing, and a time-out on any given request of I believe 5 minutes. That would seem to make reliable long-polling a real problem. Being WSGI that they control the serving of you aren't even assured that the game "server" is the same process from moment to moment, so that 10hz tickrate idea would likely go out of sync real fast when they restart any given console. They do offer a persistent database that your processes can connect to, so you could keep the world state in there... I should think a turn-based game would work, where the server-side database serves as the one store of truth and the clients merely request the current state, give the player options appropriate for that state, then pushes back the option chosen for the database to commit, tick forward, and set the new state. The clients could periodically send a heartbeat request to see if they had an available action. But real-time or anything like real-time is going to be hard with the limitations of what you're required to use.
Huh! I thought these were questions for Guido. I understand that individuals can have opinions, but I would assume that the op gets to choose which questions to filter through and which to filter out. Given that, I don't understand all the "bad blood" and down votes here.
But...res won't fit into memory?! (Am I missing something?)
You're either talking about functional or object-oriented programming. For functional programming, the most "correct" approach would be nested function calls. For object-oriented programming it's method chaining.
If you get import error no module named xxxx You can try pip install xxxx On the command line. Then run your program again.

Bonus points: what’s your naming convention for ephemeral variables? Do you just continually reassign a single “result” variable or do you try to use semantically named variables at each stage ?
Op did not say the lists were pre-sorted.
I was verbatim copying from op's description, not proposing a solution to the problem.
Not all of them provide dynamic dns
THANK YOU for this patient and well-explained response. I've been thinking this over and over again while reading all the other comments congratulating the OP on having the best solution and being "technically" correct. 
I had a look at the docs: [https://xlwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#xlwt.Worksheet.Worksheet](https://xlwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#xlwt.Worksheet.Worksheet) The format for the method you're trying to use is: Worksheet.write(r, c, label='', style=&lt;xlwt.Style.XFStyle object&gt;) The error message looks to be complaining about the `r` or rows argument, which you've passed as `container`. What is the value of `container`? Looks like it should be an integer `&gt;=0` and looking at your code I don't think that is the case. If you wanted each product name to print in a new row you may want to do this: for r, container in enumerate(containers): product_name = container.a.img["title"] sheet1.write(r, 0, product_name) wb.save("Produce List.xls") Where enumerate is described [here](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/enumerate.html). Hope this helps! Also checkout /r/learnpython for these sorts of questions.
My post history doesn't scream lik farmer. I posed ONE link to 3 different subreddits and that's it. I've posted no other articles EVER. You're just lying at this point. This is pathetic.
It was just critique on your excessively broad scope. 
You're unlikely to get updates sent within your 100ms RTT (tick of 10Hz) figure if you do long-polling. You've got three full round trips with TCP and TLS1.2 before you can even *begin* sending/receiving data. And you've got to add 100ms on top of that, because at the worst case there's an update on the server *just* after you finish your poll. This is the exactly delay that websockets save you from, by keeping the connection open and allowing the server to push (rather than waiting for an update). If you went down a long-polling path, you'd probably need to build your own game engine in JS, since (AFAIK) there's no off-the-shelf real-time web game engines which support long-polling. That's a huge ask - 2 years *might not be enough time*. But just in case, [here's a good article](https://gafferongames.com/post/what_every_programmer_needs_to_know_about_game_networking/) describing the various ways to do real-time network sync. ____ Or, just get a separate VPS which speaks websockets for actual client synchronisation, use an off-the-shelf web game engine, and retain Flask/PythonAnywhere as a content server. Maybe throw in some user signup stuff or a scoreboard to make it dynamic, which I'm guessing is a requirement.
The article is mentioning conda forge by &gt; conda -c conda-forge install my_package. It you are doing this, all environments getting packets from conda forge, which isn't often the intention. Don't do this
You will have the same memory problems with this algorithm regardless of the programming language. 
"It kept failing" is not detailed enough for us to help you. Remember, we can't see your display. 
The lists are pre-sorted. 
&gt;Do you use urllib or requests when messing with HTTP traffic? Do you use math or NumPy when working with large vectors? I see your point but these aren't reimplementations.
If it's just general Python knowledge test, then 2 hours per day should suffice, but it really depends on how quickly you can learn. If the test has some specific topic, your question cannot be answered without knowing what that topic is.
Thanks a lot! It seems you are spot on - I was lacking this term, which seems to be exactly what I'm after. Thanks! 
If your system has `systemd`, you could use service timers
This takes less effort. Also last time I used click, it was importing package_resources, which makes scripts start much slower. It's been a while since I checked, though.

If you code the OP's implementation in a "faster" language then I will code one even faster in Python. 
I'm so sorry, thank you!
Absolutely. That is precisely what I was thinking. My point again is that we can easily adapt this solution to become an iterator whereas we can't do that with the OP's. 
If you want to make a CLI program, I suggest choosing a different project. Metronome in Python would have like few lines of code, including fancy output. Not much for developing skills. Go wild. Make something useful for yourself, something more challenging, something that requires research other than googling "X in Python".
basically, it's associative and distributive. So if I distribute an unsorted list in the existing order to different nodes and they each sort their own sublist, then I merge them, it's equivalent to a mergesort of the entire list on a single node.
Sounds beautiful 
If you want to go all out. Do a python server with socketio. Host it on a vps and ONLY have it handle the game logic / sync between the clients. In pythonanywhere build another flask app that serves up two simple pages. One page contains the js for the game. On game completion redirect the user to the other page. Using get params query the server for the results of the game and display them. That will give you a tad bit of everything with learning how to build your own small little API.

I like Sphinx but I haven't found a good Python API :/
At a guess python is trying to assign a datatype other than binary for your binary values, which is why some of them are changing. You can put 0b at the beginning of a string to mark it as a binary literal, of if you're planning on juts using the dict for conversion you could put single quotes around the binary numbers to handle them as strings.

This is a classis pitfall (in python and a few other languages like C). Numbers written with a leading zero are interpreted as octal (base 8) instead of decimal numbers. When you print it back it shows the decimal representation, which is obviously different. Octal is basically never used anywhere and this convention of indicating it far more often causes confusion like this as opposed to being useful, but it's a bit too late to change the language now.

The article title is fine, the title of the reddit post is inaccurate. From a DataScience perspective, it fails to cover iterating on DataFrames and static methods which are 'un-pickleable' in turn requiring to be mapped by dill before using pool. Therefore, it doesn't show how to parallelize anything. Note: shout out to the Pathos / Dill libraries that handle this nicely. 
Maybe not NumPy, but I'd argue that requests and urllib has a lot in common when it comes to use-cases. You're able to solve the exact same problems with both libraries. Unfortunately, urllib, urllib2, urllib3 and their relations to httplib, cookielib, socket and whatnot is a complete mess. Requests have been able to reimplement in a more streamlined fashion, and I would always recommend going with that over the built-in libraries whenever possible.
Google "bit shifting". May be helpful. 
i think you meant to respond to /u/Zman98789
You ale absolutely right, Pythons Sort() is the fastest way to sort array. Worst complexity is nlog(n) which is pretty good comparing to two fors. Why would someone require not to use external libs in python lol. If you would use c, they might be thinking about extra memory consumption by adding whole lib for 1 function... but in python lol
To be fair, merging two sorted lists can be done a lot faster (linear time) than adding the two lists together then sorting then (n*log n). Not to mention creating two new sets where each object must be hashed.
You can probably still improve the speed of your solution by placing it inside an actual function. Variables in global scope can slow down Python code considerably.
this is a pretty basic algorithms question and your answers were simply wrong. You don't need to sort again, you can solve this in linear time and space: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_algorithm
**Merge algorithm** Merge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the elements of the inputs lists in sorted order. These algorithms are used as subroutines in various sorting algorithms, most famously merge sort. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I think it's pretty much impossible for pretty much all reasonable sorting tasks. You do need to read the data, after all.
I didn't read the problem statement as saying the arrays were too big to fit into memory: &gt; I was supposed to merge two arrays together in python, no duplicates - no mention of time but the solution had to be size agnostic. Let's call them a1 and a2; and the answer in b. I mean, to me, that seems like it wants you to take two in-memory arrays and produce a third. Regardless, as /u/techn0scho0lbus pointed out, it's pretty straightforward to adapt it to an iterator-based solution: def merge_sorted(xs, ys): x, y = next(xs, None), next(ys, None) while x is not None and y is not None: if x &lt; y: yield x x = next(xs, None) elif y &lt; x: yield y y = next(ys, None) else: yield x x, y = next(xs, None), next(ys, None) if x is not None: yield x if y is not None: yield y yield from xs yield from ys
Hi, it could cost nothing to have a look at: [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) Adrian wrote very good books as well Regards
I don't think you understood the point. In normal python `open`, `read` and `write` are not async methods. There is no `fin = await open("file.txt", "r"); line = await fin.readline()`. So while the OS can buffer data and process the buffers in parallel. That certainly speeds things up, but it isn't the same thing as truly being asynchronous. At any one time the kernel has only one io operation from three process that has not returned to the process. Any io concurrency is optional and at the discretion of the kernel. A truly async program uses different methods to perform basic io, and keeps multiple io operations in flight at any one time.
I was thinking about something like a database join, but that `merge` is useful to know about, and of course it's in `heapq`.
 Old trick for that is to use `itertools.groupby` and ignore the second part of the return value. 
&gt; cover iterating on DataFrames and static methods which are 'un-pickleable' in turn requiring to be mapped by dill before using pool Well, do you have an example of how Pathos/Dill would handle this?
Me? No. Someone else? Maybe. 
It depends on your needs. Whoosh (the flask sqlalchemy extension) is being used in a project I work on and it's good enough because our users don't have data sets where elasticsearch becomes worth the additional infrastructure overheard. 
I did originally while testing. I'm no timeit expert by any means. 
&gt; Find a good algorithms book and read it Any reccs?
Great answer and upvoted. One minor nitpick: the sort() implementation in Python famously uses the timsort algorithm, which is linear time if the input consists of a constant number of increasing or decreasing runs, which is the case for this input. Of course, that doesn't make it applicable for on-disk sorting.
Not sure why the title ends in a question mark but ok.

Subquery would work. I.e. delete from productid where productid in (select product\_id from (select productid, count(\*) n from rating) a where n &lt; 30) t. Probably a cleaner approach, but does the job. If you're scaling this you'll probably want foreign-key constraints with cascading deletes, or some sort of updating rule to store the full set of data relevant to deleted products. &amp;#x200B;
That's really a pdfminer.six job. Original pdfminer is gone. PyPDF2's text extraction is naive and broken. Pikepdf is a better alternative to PyPDF2 for most things, but it doesn't do text extraction. 
Honestly, easiest way may just be to write something that creates a dictionary with each unique product id and a count of how many times it appears in the list. Then remove all user id’s with a value less than the desired number of reviews.
Check out PyGame. Everything you need to create a window, draw sprites, take user input. Lots of examples as well. 
I ripped off and modified code from os.path just yesterday. I was working with a reduced version of python 2.7 with no os module, no sys.path and no `__file__` variable and I needed to pass in a value (a path) and do path manipulation.
Yeah, it's just that apparently Python slows down when it has to access the global namespace. So, just making a function with all the code and then testing that, will generally provide some speed up. It's a surprising behavior to be sure.
13 years at one place. Hard problems are usually a lack of resources and/or something being time critical and/or wacky requirements. I've solved hard software problems using my bag of things you should never use and with convoluted workarounds. I wouldn't say any specific problem has been particularly difficult, but just that it required a lot of work and making sure you understand what's going on vs. what needs to be going on. Thought experiments help. The OP didn't provide an option that could sort a list of integers that don't fit into RAM. Simple, use a library and specifically HDF5, possibly coupled with numpy. Code some C++ if it needs to be a different algorithm. The interviewer's fault/OP's lack of info regarding time complexity or say, assume you have two sorted/random lists led to a nonsensical argument. Even so, the OP should recognize or probe for more info. Real problems have few, often incomplete requirements and a lot of extraneous information.

Pandas is more than suitable. Depending on the manipulations you can use df.iterrows - if there aren't native vectorized functions for whatever you're doing and blazing fast speed isn't necessary. That being said - a more formal ETL flow may be worthwhile.

If you're going for a job as an optimisation specialist, then you'll want to know why python's sort is fast, or rather what use cases it's optimised for. It means knowing when it's appropriate to use the inbuilt method, and when you might be leaving performance on the table by doing so. That means knowing sorting algorithms. That's what he was being asked about. It means understanding computational complexity, which he failed at. The interviewer knew what he wanted, and he found out this guy didn't have it.
*Malaware* sounds like a malware detection kit.
Can dill pass a memory-mapped buffer to another process on the same machine by passing the underlying fd and mapping it in the receiving address space of the un-dilling process ?
Have you considered that the question was not really about any Python but about how you argue? It probably wasn't in the beginning, but it surely became about how you reacted when you lost your calm. 
Sure, the [Pathos Docs](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos) are quite explanatory. Pathos follows the MP style of: Pool &gt; Map &gt; Close &gt; Join &gt;Clear. Dill and Pathos were created by the same person (I believe), Pathos uses Dill to Pickle which makes the MP module more flexible (in terms of arguments it can map). In essence you want to use numpy's array_split() on either the DataFrame or Index, then pool.map the function to the list of DataFrames/Slices of Indexes. I started to build a class to handle the lifting and work as a boilerplate but I am not at a point where I would show people. Usually you code will look something like this: import numpy as np import pandas as pd import multiprocessing as mp from pathos.multiprocessing import ProcessingPool as Pool partitions=mp.cpu_count() cores=mp.cpu_count() df_split = np.array_split(df, self.partitions, axis=0) # create the multiprocessing pool pool = Pool(self.cores) # process the DataFrame by mapping function to each df across the pool df = pd.concat(pool.map(func, self.df_split), axis=0) # close down the pool and join pool.close() pool.join() pool.clear() 
You didn't get turned down for pointing out that it's more efficient to use built-in standard library functions than write naive reimplementations. You got turned down for being combative about it instead of going along with the spirit of the question, and for not coming up with the simplest and quickest algorithmic solution, real-world environment be damned. Technical interviews are about working with the interviewer to discuss interesting solutions to problems. You can't get too attached to any one approach because if you're not exploring the things the interviewer wants to check, they'll just change the problem statement.
Probably os and sys. They're realy usefull for things like files on computer or command line arguments.
Yeah, PyPi is a pretty dangerous place all things considered. Always verify the packages you're using!

Try xw.apps\[0\].screen\_updating = **False**
If you try to just run it in an infinite loop, if it crashes it will be down until you notice and will have to be stopped when you update the code. If you run as a scheduled job, a single crash won't impair future runs and code updates get picked up on the next execution. I run scheduled jobs on machines I don't have cron access to by using the sched library. 
Cheers!
&gt;I don't know what you guys can recommend to help with this. Apply it. I've used it as a reference for some pieces of work I've done; but it's not something I've 'learned' to say I'm fluent in Python. Hell multiple inheritance and ABCs are still pretty foreign to me just because I try not to use them because of the extra complexity. 
Your opinion is fair and what you feel is what you feel. I think the book is not a general programming book, but more of a "pythonic" book for poeple who either come from a different programming language or want to see improve their python skill sets. After you have written a fair amount of code and stumble upon a chapter the book, you will naturally feel like "oh i could have done it this way, huh?". I used the book for learning more about concurrency and context management. If you would like exercise, you can write an async web crawler that downloads the page and images into a temporary dir ( which will use context management), extract meaningful info and discard the downloaded part once the context ends. 
I use pyodbc for almost everything in my office. So we may be able to help you, if you posted what the issue actually is
...thats a bad approach, he has 500.000 reviews to go through.. the best way is an sql query
ModuleNotFoundError(“No module named ‘pyodbc’”) it already installed.
Uneven number of parentheses are surley a syntax error. Also String * Int repeats the steing n times.
Alright. Great first step. Now what version of python are you running? How did you install pyodbc? What version of pyodbc are you attempting to use?
I have a similar 'issue' mine says unresolved import, however the pyodbc stuff still works flawlessly. have you tried just connecting and seeing what happens?
I installed it prefer common guide python ver: 3.7 pyodbc ver: 4.0

thank you for your support u/t3hfr3ak &amp;#x200B;
Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I think I'm more than susceptible to following the new shiny thing rather than the simpler, more sensible choice (pandas). I appreciate the clarity of everyone's experience. 
Try Supervisord 4.0, it does not have timing like cron but has an extensive process manager. You can create groups of scripts and call them with a single command. It has a webinterface and a command line interface to control it. It can also notify you when a script failed unexpectedly and can restart scripts. I use it together with cron: */15 * * * * supervisorctl start groupname:* This restart all my scripts if they are down for one reason or another. 
Alright Go to your python installation folder (may be in program files) and search for pyodbc to make sure it installed there
My bank accounts are how I safeguard myself against malware. One look at how much debt I have and they run away fast.
I wrestled with installation problems on pyodbc in January of 2017. Here's [a link to the StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41858105/python-pyodbc-import-module-not-found) where I asked for help. I forget what exactly fixed it for me. It was probably learning how to use pip.
Take a look at at 'datetime' module in standard library. It can parse, format and modify dates. 
Ok so there's no way I can get my pandas output to look colored like this?
no need to install those
datetime builtin library has everything you need. You will need to write a function that will read a string, parse it to create a date object and format a string out of it in your desired format.
Assumed he meant using Python.
And they packages they're using. And the packages they're using... This function has the potential to recurse to arbitrary depths and could exceed the stack size of your programmer pretty easily, especially if the packages change/update with any frequency.
I second this. It's more complicated than cron (you need two files, the syntax isn't exactly obvious), but it's so powerful and the logging is a hell of a lot better.
Seconding this. I got a *ton* of value out of Fluent Python. Mostly through having a deeper understanding of the Python data model and core protocols (iteration, etc). A lot of times this knowledge isn't "directly" applied in my programming, but it greatly influences how I approach problems. There are a few concrete examples that I have taken out of the book, through. For one, Luciano provides a pattern for submitting function calls to a concurrent.futures executor using a dictionary compression, where the Future is the key and the value is a piece of data relevant to the function call (i.e., the URL being accessed). As the futures complete, you can use that dict to get data needed for processing the result. I use this pattern frequently whenever I have a parallelism need.
Looks like not understanding the requirements correctly, expect fair motivations and stop bashing with smileys 😅
I recommend opening a ticket on its [issues page](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues).
I take interviews almost every other week, looks like you did not understood the problem statement clearly, the interviewer clearly stated to reduce time complexity, you need to know the time complexity of standard library algos if you want to rewrite a better one, standard libs are general libs, optimization beyond a certain level is not always required in general sense.
Glad to hear it, good luck on your project.

My mistake. Although, you should learn them or just know the basics.
so it's a file format ?
this is the right way, right ? conda install -c conda-forge my_package
/r/learnpython 
 from datetime import datetime old_way = '10 Sep 2005' old_format = '%d %b %Y' new_format = '%m/%d/%y' # check out datetime module docs for other formats # str -&gt; datetime: use str(parse)time # datetime -&gt; str: use str(format)time new_date = datetime.strptime(old_way, old_format) # datetime object new_way = new_date.strftime(new_format) # converts to str 
Extensions are just add-ons or plug-ins. There is a tab in VSCode to search through all the available extensions. You can install and uninstall them directly from vscode. So for example you can get extensions that will help you write python, help you run and debug python. So for the python interpreter, you can go to the extensions tab and search "Python" and look through the list of extensions to see what will be useful for you. 
Apache Airflow
You need an option switch for the environment too. Otherwise all of your environments are getting conda-forge packages
Especially if there are I/O wait times, like writing results to disk files, you can sometimes get more throughput by running somewhat more processes/threads than you have CPUs. Usually the benefit is small but maybe worth a bit of experimenting.

React and node are distinct; node is a backend, React is a frontend. React requires node to build, but the frontend build system shouldn't determine what backend you use. &amp;#x200B; Python is among the most productive programming languages (meaning, fewest hours of coding to workable product) and is highly readable. It also has tons of tools for developing backends. As a result, it is popular for making backends.
as far as a I know, yes it is a file format. All the implementation is hidden under the hood and read and write are super fast. Whether you created parquet in R/python/java, and read in another programming language there is no serialization and serialization. e.g. here is the implementation in python https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/parquet.py

Correct. I’m about a year into a project where I’m using Django/Postgres/graphene for my backend, and React/Apollo for front end and I love it. Just took Wes Bos’s advanced react course and it’s great, but I still love python/Django far more than node for the back end. 
That indeed seems fair enough. I just found it very interesting it was such a common combination and I thought I was missing something. Thanks.

If you'd like to use python for scientific study/anything mathematics or statistics related, then I strongly recommend numpy, scipy and matplotlib. And maybe pandas. If you're looking to build GUIs at some pont then I recommend trying out tkinter. For web-related stuff and scraping, you can try out requests and bs4.

Thanks I will keep this in mind Although I do feel that senior positions should allow for some critical thinking 🤔 
Well, for starters the obvious thing to do here is to make sure you have the spelling of your package correct. If you're writing python and using open source modules from PyPi then you should review those packages yourself; look for odd things. For example, something that doesn't require any network connectivity shouldn't import the `requests` module. Another way of doing so, maybe a little more advanced for day-to-day python scripting, is to utilize a software composition analysis (SCA) tool. These tools scan your software for commonly used open-source packages and report any known vulnerabilities (typically as reported by the NIST). Security isn't perfect (a perfectly secure system is an unusable black box) so it's not like you'll ever find a solution other than constant vigilance and awareness of threats. 
well yes, by definition of merging two lists, but it's still faster to append and call sort see the 'adaptive merge sort' but, python then splits the new list into two sections and merges them

I keep on getting an error. I try and launch Neuron from the top right icon and get "The IPE extension requires Jupyter to be installed. Install now?" Jupyter is already installed, anyone know how to fix that?
There's no particular strong synergies with node+React, so you may as well use whatever you want for the backend.

EDIT2: I appreciate you'all's answers a lot. Seriously made me rethink my attitude at the interview more so than my technical skills. In retrospect, and getting the feedback from my recruiting agent, I think I did the right thing by calling the interviewer out. I owe my allegiance to the company that pays my salary and not just to the individual - so if I feel that the methods being used in their efforts may be detrimental to the company I think I should at least highlight them. [ What happens when they go to a newer version of Python if the standard libs are modified in this one? ] Also, if they cannot stand criticism then I will be better off without them. I have worked with enough personalities to know who is willing to listen and/or accept a contrary opinion and who is not. Over the years I have learned to agree to disagree and move on since relationships and peace of mind is more important to me than a few milliseconds saved. Also, I believe in delivering a product to market with a solid overall design with the right tools and using a profiler if needed to iron out any bottlenecks when needed. Again, thank you all so much for the different perspectives. 
I don't know maths but it looks like it works dunno
Where is the Python relevance?
It is a common method. Version 1.0 will probably be released only if there will be need to do major (breaking) changes, or the branch will be stable for long period (without active development). I don't have examples in my mind now...
I think it would be better to pass two whole vertecies as the function parameters, like (A, B)

Build things. You don't need the book to tell you what to build, just build whatever you want and use the concepts you're reading about.
Yes. That is my point, and why I mentioned aiofiles in my comment. asyncio is neither async, nor io. Its a framework for cooperative multi-tasking when used in conjunction with other stuff. So: 0. It has the wrong name. 1. It seems to be seriously over-engineered for what it actually does. 2. And nobody seems to really understand it. 3. Batteries aren't included. Ultimately a lot of these problems are probably related... you give the library the wrong name, and you start thinking it should do thinks it isn't capable of doing... so it acquires complex features it doesn't need... and becomes complex enough that nobody understands... and so people have to mix in simpler stuff they do understand to make it work...

I don't really know if anybody will watch it live, but if they do I'd definitely be open to input. If someone in the stream wants me to take the code in a certain direction I might listen if I like the idea. Im not really sure where I'm taking this, I just figured I'd start recording when I code so I look a little less crazy when I'm talking to myself. 
Ah then you are in for happy times. Google it and try. 
I've been doing data science for 8 years. Having me solve a random hackerrank python question with a 10 minute time limit and someone staring at me while I solve it reflects exactly zero of what a data scientist actually does. And if that is the company environment, its highly likely every conversation I'll have with coworkers to be like reddit in real life - pointless dick measuring to see who is smarter. Hard pass.
Hey man. I really wanted to watch your video, but I just can't focus because of that keyboard noises. Judging from the typos I think you need a new one :)
I have trouble believing Google doens't know about itertools. 
The LocalContext context manager modifies behavior for the current thread that the context manager entered as as such is unsuitable for suspended execution, I am also suspecting that you will attain some unexpected behavior if you leave the context by pulling the last item in the generator on a different thread. As such I do not think that this particular method of the Decimal module is really what you want, rather, you probably have to instantiate a Context with the desired precision and explicitly use this context on Decimal calls within the generator. &amp;#x200B;
I’m not familiar with that at all. Generally, if it interests you to work with, try your best to pick it up, and work on debugging. The best way to learn a language is to practice. 
I should have specified Windows users who are British or those who studied British English in the title!
Yes - I know there are several solutions to this particular example. I'm more concerned with the fact that python does not seem to have *any* solutions to allow context to be managed through suspended execution. Is there any reasoning to specifically *not* allow this, or was it just never implemented? To be clear, I assume you're suggesting something like this? def series(): ctx = Context(prec=5) with ctx: d = Decimal(1) / Decimal(6) yield d with ctx: d = Decimal(1) / Decimal(7) yield d

I'm on a Mac, so if you aren't you might need to do some additional research if you are using windows. &amp;#x200B; **Step 1 - find your python/anaconda path.** The anaconda distribution is in my home directory - \~/anaconda3/bin. IF you can't find it, in VSCODE press CTRL(CMD) + SHIFT+P -&gt; find the option "select interpreter" it should list interpreters and their location. &amp;#x200B; **Step 2 - Add path from step 1 to system path** To add paths on Mac go to the terminal and type sudo nano /etc/paths . I added a newline: Users/raptorsix/anaconda3/bin. For Windows this link should help to add a path [https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html) &amp;#x200B; **Step 3 - Add path to VS Code (not sure this is needed)** In VS Code Preferences search for python path and add the same path from step 2 &amp;#x200B; Hope that helps. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
&gt;I don't want to use reference material while coding. You're going to have a terrible time if this is truly your mindset. What you should focus on *instead* is learning programming concepts/patterns, and becoming *efficient* and *accurate* when searching through reference material. 
I don't. I've been a professional developer for well over 15 years and I constantly Google things all day long. If you understand how a computer works and the fundamental concepts of programming then the language doesn't matter. 
I think you're way out of line here. Its a "compare and contrast" interview question. 1. You're not Guido. He's probably thought plenty about voice interfaces because he doesn't live in a cave. I looked at the previous podcast guests and this is clearly not a podcast where the host is afraid of asking questions about the far future. 1. Just like locales and Unicode. I wonder what Guido thinks about that. 1. Speech interfaces also have a long history and before next year was perennially the year of the Linux desktop it was the year speech recognition would finally let you throw away for keyboard. I wonder what Guido thinks about that? 1. As input isn't used in any real code it does sit in an odd place in the language. I wonder what Guido thinks about that. I feel like you're vigorously agreeing that its a thought provoking question. It is not a feature request! 
We don't. Reference material exists for a reason. My professor staples javadoc for everything we need to use to the back of our exams.

Plus: &gt; #### How do I know when to release 1.0.0? &gt; If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.
Times have long since changed. You will not be able to use just one language. Trying to remember the detailed syntax of javascript, python, typescript, Java, Bash, SQL etc. etc. It is simply not possible. Modent programming need moderen search engibes. 
Hmm, just installed but my code executes twice. Anyone has the same problem?
Honestly, the best “tips and tricks” you can learn is to efficiently use reference material and reuse useful code snippets from your work. This means documenting with notes, and naming files accurately, so that you can jump to them when you need them. Reference materials are vital for all but the most hardcore coders (like, the kinds of guys that learned to code before they learned to speak) so don’t think of it like a crutch or a weakness. It’s part of the process.
Hi, thank you for these informations. Regards
Taking 4 parameters and returning 6 values (or one tuple with 6 values in it) is entirely possible, yes. def foo(a, b, c, d): return a, b, c, d, a + b, c + d
My first REST API in Python and Flask. Really nice and simple while not having some magic bull shit working in the background.
This is pretty cool. I like that you can run code, organize it as cards, then export them into a notebook. I haven’t seen this feature in other IDE integrations of Jupyter notebooks. Im going to try an incorporate this over notebooks into my workflow... I miss using a nice editor!
You've been told before by the bot to ask questions like these on r/learnpython. That said, don't use reddit to do your homework. Simple googling will tell you how to do this. 
I'm talking about your posts that have been deleted. There's quite a lot of those, spammer. Also, I'm able to post still, so your claims of innocence are ... apparently not that well received.
Sorry about that man! I have actually arranged a new keyboard which should be arriving soon so hopefully that should fix the problem. Appreciate the feedback though :)
I am trying to match a picture template and a complete picture with open-cv, but it doesn't work as seamlessly as I would have expected it to.

"Guest post by Lorenzo Silvestri, Electronic and Information Engineering Student at Imperial College London." It's not Microsoft saying this
Likewise, systematic moderator deletions are not indication of spamming. lso, when you're so clean, how come I'm still allowed to challenge your ideas about why spamming clothing link farms are on-topic Python? 
Oh and sorry for the shitpost btw, I'll understand if you have to take it down
I'm not really familiar enough with it to say much about it, but wouldn't `__reenter__` apply to `await`? Perhaps better method names might be `__suspend__` and `__resume__`. I see what you're saying about `localcontext` - so really the above example isn't so much a shortcoming of `with`, but a misuse of a fragile context manager. I don't really see any other way to do things like `localcontext` or `redirect_stdout`, where some global "thing" is supposed to mean something different "inside" the context, though - does that just mean that those kinds of context managers simply shouldn't be able to handle suspended execution? I don't really think it does, but I also understand the argument that the special case of these kinds of global context managers isn't special enough.
Why the hell would you use an ORM if you already know SQL? I certainly wouldn't. 
The only reason they'd take it down is for version you're running.
Sudo pip install
And RStudio before Spyder.

Can someone explain the benefits of this over a Jupyter notebook? They say it supports more output types, but then the example they give is plotly which _does_ work in Jupyter notebooks.
I am *not* an expert but I think one advantage would be interoperability with backends.
You raise a valid point. I'm not sure that introducing some kind of reenter is a good idea though, I feel like it opens a can of worms and does more harm than good; just a feeling. But you could post on the [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas](python-ideas list), you'll reach more Python devs this way than posting on reddit.

You’re right. Shame on Lorenzo Silvestri, Electronic and Information Engineering Student at Imperial College London
i don't know about this in particular (i.e. how this library executes it) but i don't know that i agree with this statement. docopt uses docstrings as something other than straight documentation and i use it pretty regularly.

Not as bad as import * Still fixing for someone else's code...
What’s wrong with it? Serious question - I’m trying to learn during lunch at work and have to use 2.7 at present (no admin rights, locked down software install list)
It will stop being supported in 2020. Other than that, nothing. As long as you aren't building an application that will be used by a bunch of people for a long time, 2.7 is fine.

2.7 is still widely used in scientific computing, though most newer things are written to be version agnostic.
Thanks! If I actually manage to keep myself motivated enough to learn enough to start doing something useful, it’s entirely possible that my output could be used for some time. I think I’ll put in a request for python 3 :p 
Looks pretty cool, but once I tried google colab I just could not see myself using anything else
Thanks. That would be very much appreciated :)
Python 3 is nicer to program, a lot of warts were fixed. The biggest one was how Unicode was handled. In Python 2 is too easy to use it incorrectly.
I just tried this (moving the function definition to the setup string. It did not get better results.
Yes I think that is the problem. I will try your fork... Thanks
I just did this. Here's the new results: def merged(a,b): a = deque(a) b = deque(b) out = [] def append(val): if not out or out[-1] != val: out.append(val) while a or b: if a and b: last_a, last_b = a[0], b[0] last_max = min(last_a, last_b) if last_max == last_a: append(a.popleft()) else: append(b.popleft()) elif a: append(a.popleft()) elif b: append(b.popleft()) return out * set union: 19.3773069382 * pop() 0.0751898288727 * pop(0) 3.03847098351 * deque.popleft() 78.3635749817 Which makes sense because the GC will be called a lot to clean up the nodes in the linkedlist created by the deque. Bjarne Stroustrup gives a good explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo
Absolutely. Snips is a fantastic platform with so much potential given the energy. The python tutorial is so easy, you'll be hacking at it within the session. 
2.6 would really be scary 
There are far worse ideas discussed on that list :)
It's just a worse language. I use python because it's a better language than many others. I use python 3.7 because it's a better language than earlier versions.
I think most newer things are build to work just with python 3, by for example using f-strings
Does that import every library available? Also, that’s horrendous.
Ah I mean from &lt;lib&gt; import * Overrides a lot of modules or functions and caused bugs.
Interesting. Do you have a more specific example of the era this causes?

What's this from? It sounds so familiar. 
You could have each script print a bit of info as if you were debugging.
dude you made me drop my phone
I would put a bit of info in each script to print out, as if you were debugging. But there is also "trace" which might help too.
&gt;... but it's still faster to append and call sort No, it's absolutely not. As many people here have pointed out there is no need to sort at all. You're introducing a relatively slow process when it's unnecessary. 
What's wrong with my vanilla Debian installs that require sudo for installs? I've understood this is a problem for years but don't know an alternative.
Lovecraft bruh. Hit up Horrorbabble on YT; Call of Cthuhlu for a treat.
Definitely a collectors item.
Always read what you're installing and where you're installing something. It sounds like it knew you were in admin mode and it did something based on that. Rather than complaining here, report a bug.
Nope, that's not it! Unclosed parentheses should always be a syntax error, but if you put 94 open-parens in a row you *don't* get a syntax error. Try it and see what happens!
I host an SFTP server so my and my friends can share game clips and other (big) files. Made a discord bot a while ago to notify everyone when a new files was uploaded, but I was never happy with how it turned out. I think this is my 3rd time rewriting it, but now I'm pretty happy with it. It's probably not necessary to rewrite it since it works just fine, but I'm still a CS student and this project is really ingraining how important code organization, documentation, and testing is, so I'm getting something good out of it.
Ok Thanks
pip install --user should be sufficient for all those times you try to do sudo pip install.
So imagime you have two files: foo.py and bar.py bar.py does "from foo import *" and also defines a function named hello Then someone comes by and adds a function named hello in foo.py. Now even though I added a simple function in foo, I am going to start seeing errors in bar because hello is defined twice
Makes sense. Thank you!
Upgrade version kthx
The interviewer might not have known that. If he had explained that it was linear time to simply return `sorted(a1 + a2)`, then that would have been a great start. The interviewer would probably have steered him to still produce the merge solution.
There’s a lot more of us than the community realizes. Nice OG post!
Clearly somebody hasn't seen Wargames.
any update .. :) 
Isn't it the same as using `install_requires` in `setup.cfg`? For example: [options] install_requires= foo ~= 1.1 Note that `~= 1.1` is shortcut for `&gt;= 1.1, &lt;2.0`
Why are they unpicklable? It's just data.
Nope, mypy is a type checker. I'm guessing perhaps you meant annotations, Guido said though that it won't happen, but then he no longer is BDFL (the last letter is ironic right now).
Ok, sorry about that and thank you for the reply!!
Does python have built in packages for any specific service? Why sound cloud should be special? What if the service gets shut down?
When you load internal html/template pages, does it re-render the page where the user can notice a white flash or is it pretty much instant to load the next page/screen?
Are you just referring to Notebook style inline outputs? Like Maple, Mathematica, Jupyter, RStudio, Atom, PyCharm, Matlab and many others? (Sage?) Or did RStudio and Spyder integrate a dynamic card-based system for displaying bits of your code using a Jupyter notebook running in the background? I figured since almost all popular scientific editors have some kind of inline/embedded outputs these days that the specific implementation VSCode implemented was what made this interesting. 
I was just using Engrish to be funny and thinking about how people around here mutilate English.

I really liked Sentdex's analogy for concurrency. Its when you're out for a run, notice your laces are undone, and stop to tie your laces before resuming your run. Both tasks were done concurrently but not in parallel
There are lots of things dill can handle that pickle doesn't. I think dill is able to do it by scanning for and additionally passing all the necessary context - so I think it can detect and pickle the class and all instance data in order to enable pickling a bound method. Bound methods are a lot of people's problem. Mine is classes in which I've implemented a class-level logger attribute. Loggers can't be pickled because they contain an open stream, so you get a PicklerException on the underlying RLock. I also have issues with VTK classes because they are all linked together in the lazy-execution pipeline, so you have to serialize a result to text and pickle that, then reconstruct the vtkPolydata after unpickling. I've got a multiprocessing scheme using queue's to pass vtkPolydata stuff around so that all the heavy 3D processing is in the background and doesn't hose my UI. multiprocessing.queue pickles everything to pass to other processes. Dill just seemed like overkill for me, so I went with implementing `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` on my logged classes and using a save and load function to deal with serializing VTK objects. I assume my solution is faster than dill scanning the universe for each thing I pass to the queue.
PHP would probably be much more scary
Isn't this kinda where dask steps in? There are lots of articles, but I remember seeing this one before... https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-learned-to-love-parallelized-applies-with-python-pandas-dask-and-numba-f06b0b367138

I just delete my loggers. That's not really data you want to save. I do use vtk quite a bit. I admit I've never bothered to pickle the objects. I always thought pickle was a slow process relative to say hdf5 for large data objects, so might as well just load them from scratch. Yeah it's work to clean up objects to pickle them and the moved file issue is frustrating, but still I'm surprised pandas wouldn't support that. It's required for multiprocessing for some reason.
that means it extracts headings and data under the heading ryt? thanks. i will give it a try.
Can't answer that because I cheated in my app :) My apps at that time is a 'not realtime' sales dashboard where the data from all over the countries consolidated once a day. around 30 big LCD, 30 raspi, and an apps to render each LCD 2 or 3 dashboard only once a day at 3.00 - 4.00 AM. I sent each dashboard in each tab of chrome and use one of the chrome add on to rotate the tab every 3 minutes. In kiosk mode you can't see the tab. In my user eyes, the apps seems just refreshed suddenly every 3 minutes. 
I want python to write abc abc

I meant the code outside of the strings. The code in the strings surely gets evaluated and transformed into a function of itself. I'll try it later when I'm at the computer and see what I get anyway.
You can install anaconda without admin rights, if that helps
It has nothing to do with node: Python is great for running backends due to a mature ecosystem with tools like Django and Flask. React is a javasript package used for building GUIs. They work independently of each other, and don't directly interact.

IE 6 would be even scarier, lol
Mine was import datetime as dt vs import datetime.datetime as dt. And when using import *, it is easy to messed them up. Mine preference now is writing a custom time management module. And told the one using import * to stop, because it easy to cause bug.
SFTP server in Python?
I mean the ability to see intermediate outputs in a normal script file. The card-style outputs is nice, though 
I can live with 2.7. THIS is the real 2spooky4me thing right here.
The problem here is that your "localcontext" isn't local at all. It's a global state. It's only local in the threading-sense, not in terms of scope. The use-case for context-managers combined with the Decimal object is just one application for context-managers (and might even be considered broken given this example) but there are plenty of other use-cases where calling \_\_exit\_\_ and \_\_entre around a yield would break things (e.g. opening a file for io). The present behaviour seems the best compromise (at least the behaviour is consistent and easy enough to understand once you look inside your iterator).
What is 2.7 may never die.

Nifty program. Think you could do one for Windows?
Hey, good at pandas is very broad, can you give us a little more details of what you need? Maybe I can help.
Being able to create an automated scheduler based on CSV from the google forms. 
line = line.rstrip() data = line.split(',')
Give us a link when it's available, can't find it so far 
I'm trying to put together a data set using python of mountains so that I can train an ML to recognise them. I am struggling. 
Which packages are still 2.7 only? This was a common sentiment for a while but all the major packages in scientific stack have been updated to 3 for years. I can only think of the gcloud sdk that wants python 2.7.
I think the biggest advantages are: 1. Separation of code and output 2. IDE intellisense and tools like refractoring 3. Better debugger when needed The biggest disadvantage I see so far is that the IDE intellisense is not linked with kernel memory, so it cannot tell you which columns you have in the dataframe with a tap of "tab".
good effort. I kept thinking "htop" as I looked at the output. 
It also makes it a royal pain in the ass to try and find out where every function is coming from; doubly so if they used a terrible organization scheme which if they used import *, they almost definitely have.
Nah I’m using Openssh to host the SFTP server. My bot listens for changes in the filesystem.
I think this is pretty cool, but can’t say I’m a fan of the card layout. I personally like the Spyder output view and tool as a whole but wish it had more editor features like folding. 
It does if you parenthesis
And Canada they're spelled like that too, least that's how I was taught in school. Damn auto-correct always says I'm wrong.
At this point I can't live without f strings.

&gt; Using pandas just to read a CSV is overkill. What makes you say that? Just so you can plug `littletable`? By that logic, using anything but the `csv` module is overkill.

Your post kind of makes it sound like python 2.7 is supported until 2024. To clarify some things, python2.7 was announced eol back in 2011 with a date of 2015. It has been pushed back to 2020 and throughout this time has only included minimal security updates. RHEL will pretty much support any of their OSes if you pay them enough. I'm sure you can find a lot of eol software on older branches that RHEL still "supports". RHEL 5 is still "supported". RHEL 7 has no eol date, RHEL 6 has the 2024 date.
So who do you think Matlab copied with their code cell idea? They rarely have original ideas, but I don't know off hand if anyone else did the code cell thing first (using comments to delineate blocks of code to run as a unit for intermediate output) or if Spyder and others were copying them. Being able to highlight part of a script and run that (with F9 I think?) is a related nice feature in Matlab.
Frankly I am not sure, I believe it is more that Python cannot pickle them or that Python's in built multi processing module cannot pickle them. I guess un-pickleable was incorrect.
C faster than C++

Check out [pyschedule](https://github.com/timnon/pyschedule)
I'm still trying to decipher what you're trying to say here
Preach it!
Why not? Python3 more Pythons?
Are you asking why a Python 2 version of your application runs faster than a Python 3 version? If that's your question, it would help if you could share what the code is doing when you notice the speed difference.
Is the Python3 written in C++?
If you care about gains in speed as marginal as those between 2 and 3, choose a different language.
If you check out the \[falcon\]([https://falconframework.org/](https://falconframework.org/)) webpage, it shows that the library written in Python2.7 is significantly faster than the one in Python3.6. The chart lists the following: Technology | requests/sec | micro-seconds/request --- | --- | --- Falcon (cythonized) CPy2.7 | 102,563 | 9.75 Falcon (cythonized) CPy3.6 | 75,507 | 13.24 This shows that using python 3.6 results in about a 3.49 microsecond slowdown PER REQUEST. That's not insignificant. It's about a 30% slowdown in speed. Granted, it's much faster than flask but when you're talking about a web-service where most of the overhead is probably database or network driven, swapping a request library for one that is 30% slower is crazy. &amp;#x200B;
Hahah yeah 
I can but I need someone to test it for windows 
Haha. Python is a joke programming language. Just curious is all.
I mean for example having a .so or .a libraries files

just because you cannot think of a use for it or personally dislike it, doesn't mean it's a "joke programming language". There are millions of developers, scientists and grad students who will disagree with you on that.
On the same benchmarks, Werkzeug and Flask performed better on Python 3. So it's possible to get good performance on 3; there are just some cases where the best way to write a particular operation will be different depending on which version you're profiling on. So depending on how recently someone has profiled and tuned the code and how willing the project is to sacrifice Python 2 performance to improve Python 3, the code may not be the fastest it can be. If I had unlimited time, I'd be interested to run that benchmark under a profiler and see if I'm good enough to find some improvements. But I don't see the time for that coming up in the foreseeable future.
Are you using PyGame? I use PyQT, works a charm for me. 
Using pandas is over kill here though, pandas sole purpose is not to read csvs. if there's a smaller module available that can do the same, it's worth it. 
Ah. Thanks.
Ah. So you're a joke programmer.
I started properly again this week mate, keep at it.
Oh no, you only should specify your immediate dependencies, if foo needs something it can similarly define it. If the dependencies can't be satisfied (for example there are conflicts) you bet pip will stop and complain, otherwise it will install everything that's needed. It works like in any other language I know it does. The main issue though is that: 1. there are tons of article on the web written by people who are equally confused (most of them are old, perhaps things were bad 5 years ago) which confusing people further 2. the documentation could be better, also it is not clear what you should look for ([setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) when you want to package a python application. 
Why Say??? Many Word? When Few Word Do TricK?
There’s probably something I don’t understand in that case. I’m relatively new to Python and inherited someone else’s codebase and they weren’t using that. Basically they had an outdated requirements.txt file where some of the packages were specified without a version number which caused the latest version to be installed, resulting in frustrating runtime errors that I resolved through trial and error. I’ll take another look at this and see if I can specify this app’s dependencies using that format. 
Because someone decided it is good time to do it. I wasn't using Python back then but from what I heard switch from 1.x to 2.x didn't include major changes. Wine (windows API that allows running Windows apps on Linux) for a long time had version 0.x to the point that people made jokes about 1.0 similar to Half Life 3. Version 1.0 happened and didn't have major changes, developers just thought it was about time.
Yeah...those aren't the types of coding questions I've seen at interviews. They weren't assessing grasp of theory, it was literally questions you would see on hackerrank.
Thank you, but I found pyschedule to be too inflexible. As I see it, you can only directly solve the Problem, not simulate it manually. 
It feels to me that they do. I think PyPA allowed author of PipEnv to join, but doesn't necessarily like his ideas. Recently for example pip was refactored and it temporarily broke pipenv, implying there was no heads up about the change. 
It's still the default installation on many linux distributions. I will be happy once "python --version" shows &gt; 3.5 on a freshly installed Debian *drool*
I think most companies like you to have a degree but I’d actually really like to know myself. 
It is possible to have a career as a programmer without a degree. Moreso than many other fields, even. It's still much easier to get started and advance if you do have a degree, though.
College degree is not usually desired, but it helps a lot. A computer science (or even software engineering) degree consists of a **lot** more than just learning a few programming languages. If it's job security you are after, you probably want to be better than 50% of the people out there already. That doesn't necessarily mean more educated, but it does necessarily mean more effective (for some value of "effective"). 
Nope. I have no degree (apart from an "associate's" from two years at a community college) and have been at it for about 30 years

&gt; Version 1.0 happened and didn't have major changes, developers just thought it was about time. That's kind of what I did for my project (scipy and matplotlib did it too and scikit-learn is doing it). It soft of became a running joke, but I didn't have 39 releases. I went from 0.8 to 1.0 and had few bug releases. Still, that was before I read about Semver.
Yeah, I mean loggers and file objects are unpicklable, but you can use getstate/setstate to delete/recreate them (or just assume that you don't need to reopen the file that you probably should have already closed anyways). My point is more for a big project like pandas, you should put forth that extra bit of effort. Same goes for struct objects, but those are weird and easily regeneratable.
Well, if setuptools doesn't do what you want... it doesn't do anything magical really, it just creates a zip archive with a handful of metadata files + your source / binaries. Just take one binary wheel, look into it and copy the structure (there's very little of it, typically way less than the amount of code you need to write to generate it...) There is a lot of pain wrt later finding and loading the shared objects (why would you need the archives tho?), in that they need to be somewhere on the path, and that's a very vague concept in Python. Look into typical code for loading a compiled Python module (usually generated by setuptools) and drop it in your project, while modifying paths accordingly--few tries and you'll figure out where it can be found.

That's a degree still technically. What type of work have you been able to do?
If you install python through system packages, you need to install pip modules through packages as well, or you'll mess up the system ones. If pip could overwrite the system installation, you could get instabilities if the system depends on them. Due to this mess, there's a lot of parameters that are implied when you run pip on Ubuntu and Debian, e.g. to ignore whatever is installed by the system. This made it really difficult to create Docker images once pip 10.0 hit the market. Whenever you install something through pip, it'll ignore that pip is installed and pull it again, breaking the Ubuntu wrapper that depends on the old version.
[PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) may be an excellent choice for you since you're just getting started and are confused. A number of people that gave up trying to do anything with GUIs have had good success with it. Lots of documentation, Cookbook and over 100 sample programs to get you started. There are [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8dD0doyrvHMoJGTdMtgLuHymaqJVjzt) too if that's how you learn. &amp;#x200B;
That's what *this question* is about!
The simplest may be [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org), especially since your game is a text based game. I think you'll really like it as a beginner. Take a look at the [Cookbook](http://Cookbook.PySimpleGUI.org), copy and paste a Recipe, and then run and modify it to get started quickly. &amp;#x200B;
I usually find it easiest to use JS/html for the UI.

Well, I didn't even know that that was possible \^\^" But isn't html a bit difficult to use with python? :o
So you would actually suggest PyQt? :o How are you learning how to use PyQt? and are you using a tool to make the layout or just writing everything yourself? :o

looks a bit too simple and plain for what I want to achieve
College degrees for programming are ridiculous. There are 13yos in Russia with better programming skills than a lot of BSCS grads. Programming is one of those skills easily learned on your own, and there are a ton of free resources. Unless you are wanting to do compsci research, you are better off building a portfolio of projects, which you can leverage into a job or start selling programs directly. 
Finished up a Python script to email my daycare provider for monthly statements. Still troubleshooting a python script for re-encoding my media library. (subtitles are getting dropped by handbrake)
One of the very first thing my computer science teach told us: “You can make errors, that’s what programming is all about. But never, #EVER do import *. You will regret it for the rest of your life and I’ll hate you”
QML. Not html but still declarative markup and JavaScript. If you know JavaScript it is a great choice for UI logic. The answer to what your looking for is probably pyqt and qml. Look it up. Honestly for a python gui everything else is mostly a waste of time.
Need ? Of course not. Would it help? Yes 
Two things: 1. Can you check your SSH Server's log file? 2. Try running with a higher paramiko debug level: paramiko.common.logging.basicConfig(level=paramiko.common.DEBUG) Might give some more indication as to what is failing. 
May I ask which languages you know besides Python?
So just order the same 3 books that are in the degree that you “don’t have” outside of a degree 
fair point. The whole Data Science, Infrastructure Automation &amp; the API that serves the system is done in Python. I will get into more details in the next 2 posts.. Sorry if you feel mislead..

Learning the basics.
the main struggle that I am experiencing with PyQt5 is the switching between frames, doesn't want to work and keeps crashing constantly :s &amp;#x200B;
I have no degree, not even an associates. 31 years ago I was able to get a guy with a small IT shop to take a chance on me and teach me how to be a professional programmer. School or no school, there is a way that things are done in good organizations, and learning how to be professional is vital. He took the time to show me these things, and without those lessons, I would never have had a future. &amp;#x200B; I spent 3 years at my first job learning anything and everything that I could. They had access to licensed software that I could never purchase on my own, they had a real, running system that served the needs of a large business. I learned everything that I could about how it worked, and how the various pieces tied together. I also asked lots of questions about how the business used its IT. &amp;#x200B; I also did all the research that I could about what the 'hottest' skills were, and did my best to be an expert in them. At that time, this meant leaning Unix (all the proprietary ones, Linux wouldn't be along for another 7 years or so) and Oracle. Today it probably means Python and agile methodologies. &amp;#x200B; Today I am a Dev Ops practitioner, and nobody has asked about my degree in almost 20 years. Once you are established, it won't matter, but the truth is that the next few years are going to be very hard. You are going to need to learn more than the guys with degrees, and you are going to need to learn it while trying to do the job at the same time. I sincerely wish you the best of luck, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about my path. &amp;#x200B; Good luck!

It depends on the career path. Programming is very broad. Degrees affect job prospects differently. For most types of application development, it doesn't really matter. This is more akin to a trade. Most CS degrees won't give you that much of an edge because day-to-day work isn't that interested in algorithms, data structures, hardware architectures, or other heavily academic concepts. They will help you to an extent, but not as much as in other disciplines For cyber security, it's a toss-up. there was a time where it didn't matter, but as things get increasingly complex, there's not nearly as much an uneducated hacker can offer beyond simple pen-testing Data science is more math oriented. If you know your math and/or are good at finding patterns, you can fake it without a degree, but that's a pretty big if I dont know much about game development, but I suspect there are niche's where a degree is irrelevant There are more disciplines to cover, but I don't have the time to break it down further, but with each sector there will be realms that you can't break into that easily without having invested the time for a masters or phd, but the most important aspect is industry experience. once you get your foot in the door and aren't utterly incompetent, you will be able to make a career out of it
I saw a similar program in the exercises for Rick Halterman's book.
I was doing this for a class project, but that sounds interesting. Is it worth a read? 
We went from 2.7 (I have no fucking clue why they chose to build a product in 2014 using Python 2.7) to me completely rewriting this beech in 3.7 8)
&gt; INFO:paramiko.transport:Auth banner: This is the consent banner that will **force the administrator to answer yes or no before they are prompted for the password.** That looks to be the issue: It's requiring "you" (the paramiko session) to "answer yes" before even asking for the password. Unfortunately I can't find any information about how to bypass this (notice and consent banner). You'd have to break the paramiko session setup (the connect() call) into separate pieces to know how/when to send the "yes" answer to the SSH server. 
Now have it print out n-sided dice rolls complete with ascii representation :-D 
Get ready to \`\~\~print 'hello'\~\~ oops I mean print('hello')\` :D
Sounds like an interesting idea! 🐍 
This is the main thing I am excited about... god I need a life.
Now hook it up to an API endpoint and offer Dice Rolling as a service!
Hehe, not sure my skill level is quite there yet. Will be there soon with time and practice :D
Did you not encounter any performance hits using `functools.partial`? I certainly did, writing my own library for doing this kind of stuf..
Nice. Just wondering what advantages does that have over using something like bootstrap and flash? I’ve never used a static gen so I don’t really know the trade offs..
Just updated my other comment with some more info.
possible improvements: Draw the dice in a grid so you can roll 10 and have the results fit on the screen. consider using some other symbols to make the ascii drawing nicer. There are unicode symbols specifically for drawing frames. The windows terminal is shite though and you need to fiddle with code pages. Play **again**, not agian ;-)

It's actually possible to make a dice animation by using import os and os.system('cls') to clear the current terminal window. I had to make a dice roll in high school and it blew my teacher away!
I find PyCharm to be an excellent tool for this purpose. It can jump from classes and their methods to their parents to their children and from instances to where they are instantiated, and a bunch of other stuff like that. Additionally, it can build a class diagram of the whole project to show you a good overview of the whole thing. 
Yeah I can probably find my code from way back then but basically it just prints a randomized dice face has a small time delay then clears and prints another random one. As for the time delay stuff you can use import time and time.sleep(number of milliseconds) to set the speed
lmfao, I had a good chuckle from that. thx
Yeah I'm mainly fluent in python but I've done a little bit of js as well. Lots of syntax differences but otherwise lots of the concepts are the same

You would only need to learn to use a simple web server framework (for this I would recommend Flask) and could then publish it for free in Python anywhere

Amazon Lambda and their API gateway :-)
It's kind of strange, though. The _parse_userauth_banner() only gets called under the ["gssapi-with-mic" authentication type](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/master/paramiko/auth_handler.py#L303), but you're using username/password. So I'm not sure how to proceed to be quite honest. 
The book is more didactic in nature, so it will teach you some great algorithm fundamentals. I think it is better college freshmen who want to learn CSE but haven't opted for it, over Eric Matthes' great Python Crash Course book, which is geared more towards high school sophomores.
I was going off of the Red Hat product retirement date (end of maintenance support 2), when CentOS and others based off of Red Hat will be end of life. https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/ Agreed that if you pay for the extended life cycle support, the dates you mentioned are accurate.
I must say that this is extremely amazing. To discover that you built this as your traditional "Hello World!" app is simply amazing. I definitely have to grow up and build more practical applications. In all, this has encouraged me and challenged me also. Thanks for showing the light.
Remembered me of all the fun time playing with pygame
It isn't much? This is really cool (coming from someone who maintains python packages). Give yourself a pat on the back for a great, non-trivial program.
Sure, you can do that. I'm not saying you even have to do that much. I'm just saying that without a degree you are starting a little bit behind. It's definitely possible to catch up from there.
eww.. Windows
Could you explain why you don't want to compile or link your code during the wheel creation? BTW, this would be a good topic for /r/learnpython.

QStackedWidget is still referenced in the [documentation for PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/class_reference.html). Are you sure it is not present anymore? (on mobile now and can't verify, but it should be in `PyQt5.QtWidgets.QStackedWidget`).
Yes yes you're right I got mixed up with pygame's time.delay which uses milliseconds
I'm taking my first intro to programming class in Python. Just finished learning If/else statements and creating my first rock, paper, scissors game! Starting to learn While statements but getting confused. I definitely need more practice.
You should ask questions like this on r/learnpython but I don't see any problems in your code anyway maybe you've changed the code and just need to save it?
try running your code from cmd. press shift+rightclick then select open cmd or powershell (somethink like this will be in context menu) type python name_of_your_code.py .Run your code couple of times to see if you get the same error.
put the `tries` variable inside of your function 
**Troubleshooting advice:** In situations like this I would advise first copying the error message you're receiving in the terminal (UnboundLocalError) and try searching for it in Google/DuckDuckGo/StackOverflow along with the keyword "Python". You will likely be able to figure out the issue by reviewing others who have already asked this question. Learning to research errors in your code will become an invaluable skill. **Possible solution:** I believe that making tries a global variable is the problem. When you increment the variable inside your function Python tries to change its scope. Instead define tries within your function.
Once you learn one language, others come really easily, at least in my experience. The fundamentals are all similar, but the implementation is different. When you know how to do what you want to do, it's just the matter of figuring out how to write it in whatever language you choose.
No idea. Agreed that it's a nice feature 
I think a degree helps to prevent you from re-inventing the wheel with regards to common algorithms. That is, it exposes (or should expose you!) to a broad range of concepts and knowledge. You might never use 90% of it in day-to-day stuff - if I want something sorted, for example, I just use object.sorted() in most programming languages these days and that's that, unless I'm sorting 1.2 trillion objects and I need speed. But one day, you'll bump up against something and you won't know how to solve it. If you've had enough experience, you can figure out a reasonably optimal way of solving that problem, or at least you know the right terms to Google to get you on your way. But if you can't recognise that a particular flow in a program your writing is easily solvable with a well-known algorithm, you're going to be re-inventing the wheel a lot. So basically a degree is a way of ringing a faint bell in the back of your mind, something that says, "hey, this is similar to that thing we learned in Comp Sci 304", and you can go from there. Sure, you can do without it, but then you're not standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before you. OP, if you're not suited for college life, think about doing a degree via distance education. You can generally work through a degree at a reasonable pace (normally twice the time it takes full-time) and it will help you in the long run.
First of all, I do not think I have ever had a problem with `functools.partial` but this code doesn't need it! You can pass additional args and/or kwargs for all and/or per-call. Also, you can use lambdas if that is easier

Also a fork from circa 3.3.0 here- https://github.com/thawtes/livecli
You will probably use os lib to get directory names (os.listdir) and check if certain files exist in a directory (os.path.exists) however, to copy the file you should use the shutil library. You could copy the files by reading the contents and creating a new file to which you write these contents. This will however not preserve the files metadata.
Not really. At first its just different. And later it's a headache as you rebuild django if you ever attempt to use it in a professional setting.
Thanks a ton! Just what I was looking for.
EDIT: Oh a fork, still valid!
Darn it, it's too old. &amp;#x200B; Looking for 3.10.0 mainly for one plugin... &amp;#x200B; ## livecli 3.10.0 (2018-05-26) **Added Plugin** &gt;\[plexstorm\] new plugin for plexstorm.com
I think you just figured out step 2
Because you need an ORM and an HTML templating system for a service...
Darn, it's a bit too old. &amp;#x200B; 3.10 is the version with the plugin im looking for. Thank you for your help though!
&gt;see download link on right Yeah I checked that out already. It only details the pkgbuild and and global header.

No one's forcing you to use them. Better than having to go through dependency hell with 10 different independent plug-ins when you do want them though.
It takes one hour or more to compile and many dependencies, not very practical 
I don't know, but I have a hard time imagining the price of pro not being worth it to someone. Easily the best money I spend on myself for my professional and hobby purposes. 
I remember doing this for my ITCS class! Ah the memories

C, C++, Perl, Ruby, lisps, maybe others I've forgotten about. I don't use any of them regularly though.
Same. Lucked out at a startup as an intern. Basically just wrote terrible code all day everyday until today, where I still write terrible code but no longer offensively terrible :)

Great small project! Good job buddy!
Django is more batteries included like having authentication. Flask is more like use or build what you need. I think flask is easier though, but Django isn’t that hard either.
What do you mean by wanting to simulate it manually? Do you mean like a discrete event simulation or agent based modeling? 
if you knew how sort() in python worked, you wouldn't call it a relatively slow process so, as i mentioned elsewhere, python uses 'timsort', or adaptive merge sort you can see where i might be going with this, with 'merge' in the name adaptive merge sort, unlike merge sort, partitions a list into ascending and descending sublists, and then merges them this means if you call sort on a sorted list in python, it scans it, partitions it into one list, and then returns it. this also means that if you call sort on two lists joined together, it scans it, breaks it into two lists, and merges it the thing you might have also missed here is that sort() suffers from no interpretation overhead, unlike writing it in python

hey buddy, yours is one hundred and twenty three times slower in benchmarks so here's the merge by hand in python ``` $ python3 -m 'timeit' ' a=range(0,3_000_000,3) b=range(0,3_000_000,5) out = [None] * (len(a)+len(b)) ax, bx, ox = len(a)-1, len(b)-1, len(out)-1 while ax &gt; -1 and bx &gt; -1: na, nb = a[ax], b[bx] if na == max(na,nb): out[ox] = na ax-=1 else: out[ox] = nb bx-=1 ox-=1 while ax &gt; -1: out[ox] = a[ax] ox-=1 ax-=1 while bx &gt; -1: out[ox] = b[bx] ox-=1 bx-=1 ' ``` 10 loops, best of 3: 2.01 sec per loop and here's what i was saying ``` $ python3 -m 'timeit' ' a=range(0,3_000_000,3) b=range(0,3_000_000,5) out=[] out.extend(a) out.extend(b) out.sort() ' ``` 10 loops, best of 3: 163 msec per loop you might fault me on a small dataset (6 million elements), or the amount of runs or whatever what you and everyone else is saying to do: 10 loops, best of 3: 2.01 sec per loop what i am saying to do 10 loops, best of 3: 163 msec per loop 
Reading a code base and absolutely have no ideas each functions came from. Have to check each calls. Thank god for created PyCharm.
And I am using 2.6...
i have heavily edited this post because i am tired and ill but it should run and look ok now
thanks for downvoting my comments because you don't understand how python's sort works nor could be bothered to check before disagreing with me
/r/raining would love this. 
Plus I might make me an easy 5 euro!
I use PyQt and PyCharm together quite extensively, what problems are you having with it?
why would you use django for this lmao
I'm working on learning the Python basics. I've been using Powershell for all of my Automation needs but I wanted to start learning Python to unlock more Automation POWA!!!
Because writing `django-admin startproject mysite` is easy? Why wouldn't you use Django?
Next exercise: find out how much advantage you get by going first in Snakes and Ladders. You can use lists or dicts to represent the start and end of a snake or ladder...
Top speed is [~20mph](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/giant-panda-bear/). Also, for some operations, Pandas is very slow compared to using numpy arrays. Depending on your use, this may or may not be significant.
Nobody can answer your question. It's fairly easy to benchmark it either way...

Awesome article!! Thank you!
Create a simple spreadsheet, look up python libraries for reading that file format, make a project out of reading your data from the spreadsheet, running calculations in Python, then exporting an output file. Good luck and remember that every expert was a beginner at one point.
Which os are you using? Which version of python?
Interesting. Thanks!
I feel like I am having a lot of weird difficulties downloading these libraries. Are there any good short tutorials that could get me started with bringing the two together in your opinion?
I am on Windows 10 64-bit, I just downloaded 3.7.1. in regards to python.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Once you get going with pip, install xlwings (https://www.xlwings.org/). Great library for interacting with Excel files in Python.
With the pip issue, you may need to \[add pip to your PATH\]([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)). Pandas is what I like to try and use initially when working with spreadsheets, but there are several other good libraries as well you can google. If you're brand new to all this, then maybe a pandas tutorial would be a good place to start.
You need to add python to your PATH in order to do things like pip. Can you call `python` from the shell? If you get an error it's because it's not in your path
Django vs Flask is like having a ready-made Wordpress template vs Making your own website from scratch, with Django's batteries-included workflow everything is ready-made for you given you know the appropriate commands; on the other hand, Flask contains smaller-building units and you have to combine them to make more complex, customized projects, One point is that Flask is beginner-friendly as it shows how things are happening behind-the-scenes instead of just creating everything for you.
I have added it to my path and i used the code **echo %PATH%** to check if the path was there and C:\\Python34\\Scripts is now there. I retried to enter 'pip install requests' still getting the same message
What is Jupyter Notebooks. &amp;#x200B;
It's easier to see than tell. It's basically a website that runs locally that uses your python installation to create a webpage you can write programs in. It's halfway between the shell and an ide buts it's really useful for prototyping code
Try `pip3 install requests` or `pip3.4` if that doesn't work you've got to Google for reasons
Just google "tayrona giveaway" and thank me later.
Interesting. I was just asked this question last Friday at an interview. It's a question meant for entry/jr software guys to simply show them how you work through a problem. This is not a question a senior dev should have gotten. You dodged a bullet. 
Python is a fantastic starter language. It has so many libraries! You can use it for just about anything. Scripting, web, data analysis, creating files, reading files, anythiinnggg. Java is great too, but it "looks scarier". As silly as it sounds, I've heard a lot of people say that Java simply looks more difficult. After learning python and object oriented principles, java will seem like your just reading a 5th grader's handwriting. You can tell what's it's supposed to be, but some words are in the wrong place (syntax being different and what not). But yea....Python! And check out Atom as your notepad. Watch a video on setting up Atom for Python. Lots of little addons that make it a great development environment, in my opinion. Good luck!

You're asking a lot from a guy who just recorded a video of his computer monitor.
This is a better fit for itertools than for a straight list comprehension. &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import accumulate &gt;&gt;&gt; list(accumulate(int(x == -1) for x in a)) [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3] 
I have a non code suggestion- use screenshots
Haha I was wondering when someone was going to call him out on it
As someone else who's learning... quick question. What does `enumerate()` buy you here? Doesn't look like you're using the counter variable (*i*) at all... I wasn't familiar with the function and had to look it up, so I'm glad it's there, as I learned something. But just wondering if I'm overlooking something in the code that would make enumerate() a better option than just `for x in a:`
Well my application is working but with many things it say's that the reference couldn't be found :/ I've reinstalled pycharm, python and PyQt5 today but still having kind of the same issue \^\^" But as long as it works I guess :p I started getting more into PyQt because I saw that many people are quite happy with it. 
Noice! 
In my experience, `functools.partial` has an overhead, and it is visible when you try to work on very large datasets. Here is a small benchmark, but you can figure how this goes down with large arrays. ``` In [1]: from functools import partial In [2]: def pow(x, y): ...: return x ** y In [3]: In [3]: partial(pow, y=10) Out[3]: functools.partial(&lt;function pow at 0x7fbc2444ed08&gt;, y=10) In [4]: pow10_partial = partial(pow, y=10) In [5]: def pow10_normal(x): ...: return pow(x, 10) In [10]: %timeit pow10_normal(10 ** 10) 556 ns ± 40.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) In [11]: %timeit pow10_partial(10 ** 10) 631 ns ± 28.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) ```
You're right, there's no reason to enumerate here. 
Are there alternatives in the sense of notebook. It's definitely great for rough prototyping, but it's truly a mess when your code starts getting complex. It doesn't promote writing functions and limiting scope so taking a notebook and putting it into useful code can be a pain. There was a great link to a presentation nlp bloke who hated Jupyter and that presentation was like being shown kerning, I can only see all the negatives of notebooks nowadays.
You are not missing anything in fact for x in a : ... Works just fine that snippet of code is taken out of context. Doing machine learning hw here in the east cost at 3am. Enumerate is helpful like if you need to keep a position and know the thing inside it's faster. For example given a list a = [1,2,3,1,2] Find the index of the largest number. You can do both For I in range(Len(a)) : ... Or Count = 0 For x in a: ... Count += 1 Or For c,val in enumerate(a): .... It's just another tool in your python tool belt. I wanted to see if I could keep a variable in a list comprehension but I don't think I can. The answers I got are correct but not fater than a counter over millions of rows 
Drawing the dice, rather than lazily printing a number from 1 to 6 gets you an upvote from here. 👍
Thanks 
Source code pls
While I like django much more than flask, even I think that using django for this situation is overkill. And yeah, `mkdir mysite` isn't that harder :)
Tried the Flask tutorial that was posted on this sub a week or 2 ago. Only took half an hour so I figured out the basics of Jinja and set up some templates, static files etc. Now I want a db and have been curious about sqlite for a few years (I'm a teacher and we've always used mysql) so I'm jumping down that rabbit hole. I'm trying to figure out how to make all this accessible to high school students but I'm thinking the step up is just a bit too much at this point
Try PySimpleGUI https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/
how about using another random number generator library. One of those sophisticated ones.
wx is fantastic. Lots of widgets, easy layout once you get the hang of box sizers, native look. It seems like it's a less popular option, but I prefer it. 
Good example. Reinventing the wheel in this case is not an issue. Its more the learning process and the skill gains from furthering the project.
Now put on RTX
do you also use arch btw ? 
"Why Jupyter is data scientists’ computational notebook of choice" Well, it's not.
I like this a lot, thanks !
If by "binding" you mean printing in GUI using stdout, then I'm afraid there is nothing like that available. You have to use GUI objects to place the text. Please, read library documentation for more information. 
&gt; WHADDYA GONNA DO Upload it to PyPI and specify the libraries dependencies for its installation. Also, it would be interesting to know the True/False Positive and True/False Negative rates of the predictions. I think a good enough experimental design would be to make two predictions at random times in a period of 24h and record the results for a period of several days (maybe 1-2 months). Note: of course, this wouldn't be enough for something serious, such as scientific publication, but it should be enough as an exploratory analysis of how reliable is your tool.
I want to do a multi-agent system where every Ressource (Machine) is an Agent that has some possible actions in a given state. So yes ... agent based modeling
This can be refactored: `for i, tup in enumerate(weather_data):` `from_data = tup[0]` `value_data = tup[1]` &amp;#x200B; to: `for i, (from_data, value_data) in enumerate(weather_data):` `...`
a = \[ 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1\] count = len(\[i for i in a if i == -1\]) b = range(0, count+1) &amp;#x200B;
There is official support of pyside2 with nice license, which allows closed source app creation without payment (pyqt5 license do not allow this). I strongly suggest pysid2.
flask &gt; django. sorry 
Curcial thing is not to put all code into notebook. Usually I writ all classes/methods into separate \*.py files with few unit test. This allows me to have only useful info inside of notebook.

Programming is hard when starting. I wouldn't worry about what you will be doing and instead learn to program simple stuff with simple exercises first.
Automated my bug reporting through xlwings, pandas and selenium. It fetches bugs related to my area from the server and displays new issues since last seen, number of show stoppers and high bugs. Now I’m try to incorporate most repeated words and fuzzy matching to take out near-duplicates bugs as most of the bug descriptions are similar. 
How do people make notebooks play nice with git? It's a pain having all the outputs stored inside the notebook itself since that makes git diff messy.

Haha, there's also Win+alt+r on Windows 10 that starts recording the window (emphasis on window: if you switch Windows or try to obscure it with another window, the video will still appear normal). You may have to click that it's a game, since the tool is meant for gaming.
Check out [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/)
Looks pretty good. You could also crosspost this to r/pygame.
Why inconditionnally hate / love a tool? Jupyter is great for prototyping. Use it for that, and open a plain ide when your proto seems to work? 
# Figure out multi-line lambda already. # Let me provide some form of type checking/hinting, especially for parameters. This is really frustrating because helper tools like intellisense are helpless without a type to work from. 
All of the problems that I have with Python would require a substantial undertaking to resolve, so I can't really consider them constructive criticism.
Data Analyst &amp; Technical Consultant - I run python workshops for my companies data analysts. Pandas is bread and butter for analysis - learn at least the basics. I also recommend getting familiar with 'requests' for working with APIs, and 'SQLalchemy' for interacting with databases. SQLalchemy feels like writing python, but gets executed as SQL. Also - ##learnpython is a great IRC channel with plenty of helpful folk if you ever get stuck. good luck!

 Personally, I find it very easy to use, remembering basic workflow: 1. import xlwt; 2. create your spreadsheet using eg. my\_xls=xlwt.Workbook(encoding=your\_char\_encoding), which returns you spreadsheet handle to use for adding sheets and saving whole file; 3. add a sheet to created spreadsheet with eg. my\_sheet=my\_xls.add\_sheet("sheet name") now, having sheet object, you can write on it's cells using sheet\_name.write (row,column, value): my\_sheet.write(0,0,"First column title") my sheet.write(0,1,"Second column title"); 4. Save whole thing using spreadsheet.save ('file\_name.xls') my\_xls.save("results.txt")/. 
I need this! 
No subreddit is immune to halloween shitposting.
There's git commit hooks you can use to copy and clean the notebook. But still.
In the for loop at the end, add: username = row[0] password = row[1]
Creating an empty set is inconsistent with the ability to create Empty strings, tuples lists, and dicts. {} == set() # False 
Almost working, Unfortunately it prints a single char and not the entire row when I print the variable Username and Password.
Importing Numpy is faster than a list comprehension? That's like saying a jackhammer is faster at putting nails in sheetrock, but ignoring that's its clearly too much for the job. and also takes significantly more time to transport to your living room than the 12 oz hammer already hanging from your tool belt.
 1. There GIL is the most famous one. It improves performance in most cases, but generally gets in the way of pure-Python multithreading. 2. The handling of mutable default arguments is a known source of a lot of bugs. 3. It lacks a switch block. 4. It isn't a fast as many compiled or JIT compiled languages. 5. The peephole optimizer doesn't handle a lot of cases that could be optimized. 6. There are a bunch of problems with the C api that are too involved to get into here. 7. The metaclasses interface has some weird issues, like forcing you to manually keep track of all instances.
Ah, you're using fetchone and not fetchall. Try removing the for loop and print statement at the bottom and replacing with: username = myresult[0] password = myresult[1] print("{} {}".format(username, password))
You’re not iterating over rows here. `fetchone` fetches a single result. In this cause you should do password = myresult[0] username = myresult[1] # or use tuple unpacking password, username = myresult Additionally, you don’t want to use string formatting in an SQL query because this way you have an SQL injection vulnerability. Use prepared statements.
Doesn't coffeescript use brackets, like any other c-styled language?
Missing tail call optimization. 
Thanks. Didn't know that one. Another tool in my belt. 
maybe a different character so || == set() ?
Multi-line lambda? Like a function?
what i would like to see: when a machine learns, what kinds of data structures does it now have that it did not have before?
Finally pushed out latest [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing) version 2.3.0, and getting close to a solid release of [littletable](https://github.com/ptmcg/littletable) (currently at 0.13.1). So tired of answers on SO when someone is struggling with the \`csv\` module and the answerer says "no problem, just use pandas". Yes, pandas is powerful, and importing data to DataFrames is easy, but it is pretty heavyweight. littletable has easy import/export of CSV, JSON, and fixed-format data, and the resulting Table can be treated just like a Python list (but also joined, pivoted, and queried). And it's very, very, lightweight compared to pandas.
ah? who care on the one time of 1msec it takes to import numpy? maybe if he doesnt have numpy installed at all maybe then its not worth it(while the chance for that is super small, who dont have it) now imagine the example he gave is only small one and its actually millions of numbers vector, then 1by1 operations like the proposed ways will be huge time consumers
I don't understand what purpose this would have or benefit of it over defining a function. Can you give me an example of where it would come in handy or some reasoning behind wanting it?
are you wanting/expecting all empty things to be equal?
There is a lot of bad practices and confusion about it, I'm blaming documentation and not clear place where one can find the right information. The requirements.txt is meant for version pinning, but nothing stops people from using that for dependencies. Especially that with requirements.txt you no longer need to create setup.py/cfg.
does that mean i can use them in place of `def` by just assigning them to a variable name?
No, they're lamenting that there's no empty-set literal
Do not use this, but `{*''}`. (Works with any empty sequence on the inside, of course, but the quotes make it look a little bit like a face which clearly makes this superior to, say, `{*()}`)
I heard Flash was better than masonite. Thoughts?
Wow this is awesome!
Well if you use Python or other dynamically typed language then you're always using it.
i think the colon was originally used by the parser so that it didn't need to know what the statement was to do. but i can see what you mean when the semantics of `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`, and so on are understood.
You mean Flask? If so, it's pretty much the golden standard of DIY web dev in Python, or you go the Django route if you want something premade &amp;#x200B; Masonite seems cool but the community behind Flask is too big to make it a viable alternative so far I guess, not enough "killer features" to convince me to switch
Just download it and view it with jupyter notebooks on your computer? GitHub doesn't always successfully render them.
Have you tried clicking the `reload` button?
maybe you should create the `Black Cat` programming language.
many in the Python community seem to dislike one of the features that attracted me to Python: dynamic typing.
Can you please point me to an example by prepared statements?
Does Django or Flask have more support?
Removig the for loop worked, now it capture the entire row. Thanks!
You may use the [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlcursorprepared.html)
Thanks! I'll definitely look it up and go with prepared statements, I don't want to mess with getting hacked.
Haha you have to go out of your way to enforce typing. Though isn't there some static type stuff being added into python?
Would Typescript be an exception. I mean, you can declare something to be Any and I guess it would be more "dynamic" and "anything goes". 
I second this. People seem to hate the most awesome feature of the language xD
When random.shuffle() just won’t do.
I'm gonna hook it up to a red LED on my Pi once I get my electronics kit. I tried to make the version I shared as simple and test-friendly as possible. :)
This is 100% a readability decision that Guido took long back. You can't have this, sorry.
Wrote a small utility to fetch application logs from different server instances and generate a summary from those logs. 
Oh, that's funny, but I don't understand shit. For those too lazy to open their own consoles (this is 3.6, all compilation parameters default): * `x == 93` just throws SyntaxError * `x == 94` throws SyntaxError, too, but also complains about parser stack overflow * `x == 100` complains about parser stack overflow *and* throws a MemoryError.
They're both among the top Python libraries by use
They added optional type hints in 3.5 but it's ignored by the Python interpreter, it's optional use is for linters like what's built-in to PyCharm
Plus, Amazon lambda lets you turn it into an Alexa skill. I'm sure this already exists, but going from an idea to saying "Alexa, roll four d10" in your living room would be pretty satisfying.
If you have to declare types then it's not dynamically typed by definition, it's "statically typed". So Typescript isn't a dynamic typed language.

That scenario assumes that the person reviewing the resume is technical enough to even know what GitHub is. A lot of resume reviewers I've encountered aren't tech savvy, and just look for a few key items: education, years experience, and maybe if some key technology used by the company is mentioned.
&gt; Additionally, it can build a class diagram of the whole project to show you a good overview of the whole thing. Hmm [according to the docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/viewing-diagram.html) it only does this for a particular class. Is there a way to go to the root of a project and navigate to an item which will drill down through all the code and produce a diagram? We use Community Edition, but I would willingly pay for Professional if it did this. If not, maybe WingIDE or something else does it. I'll have to look around. 
yes
Yes, get the college degree, it's worth it. Then, work for a few years and eventually start a master's degree part-time, and find a company which will pay for it! You technically can have a **job** without a college degree, but you likely won't get a **career**. Without the degree(s), you'll hit a glass ceiling. Also, in the consulting/contracting world, some clients have a bachelor's degree as a hard minimum for their projects. Consider this, do you want to be writing code when you're 50? No, you won't. The reason is because you'll be tired of doing the low-level work, while your peers would have moved up to higher paying positions. Second, the people doing the coding in that time will still be younger, who know the new and cool stuff that will be coming out then, while you'll be still slinging the old stuff. In short, the college degree helps somewhat against ageism, since you will have moved on to grander things.
There are lots of patterns that use this in other languages, the way I like to use it is to use them to define callback functions for parameters to functions that behave like conditional or loop constructs. 
That would be inconsistent with the other empty values, too, since they are initialized by using their corresponding opening/closing characters. - Tuple: () - List: [] - Dict: {} - string: "" or '' - set: {} # conflicts with dict
Good bot. 
Let's implement a dumb integer max function. How would you do it? def get_max(values): max_value = -1000 for value in values: if value &gt; max_value: value = max_value return max_value Except we don't support values less than -1000. I guess I could also store a flag of did we ever find a max, but were we just to initialize max_value to None, that may be an solution to the problem. There are many variations of this idea. Run a function and calculate the secondary dimension in a list of lists, except the length of the lists was 0, so we don't have a second dimension. We could say it's 0 or -1 (or error), but may be just as good. If you've ever done the slice `mylist[5:]`, the second argument is None. If you've done `mylist[:5]`, the first argument is None.
can you recommend me some resource on using flask? I only understand the basic, when there are POST/GET or sending data to another webpage, I'm confused
Touché 
A lot of the basic concepts are shared between Python 2 and 3, such as declaring variables, types, loops and conditionals. The ones you need to watch out are: * In Python 3 print is a function, not an statement (it requires parenthesis). * Python 3 uses input() instead or raw_input() * Python 3 uses range() instead of xrange() * In Python 3, 5//2 will return a float, in Python 2 it will return an int. * Python 3 has buiit in unicode support, you don't have to do encode(), decode() when handling strings (you can do it, but that's for special cases). * In Python 3.6+ you can use f-strings which are pretty useful when you want to format strings. your_name = input("What's your name? ") print(f"Hello {your_name}") My recommendation is to start over with Python 3 and just skip what you already know.

&gt; In Python 3, 5//2 will return a float, in Python 2 it will return an int. No, in Python 2, `5/2` will return an int (2), in Python 3, it will return a float (2.5). `5//2` always returns an int.

What do you use for dealing with images? I mean what do you mean when say that "attribute is an *image*"? &amp;#x200B; Anyway, you always can save image as binary file, and than read it back. Also you can use pickle module for dumping whole Image instance. 
Then just build one
You print "print" to a GUI window with [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). It will reroute stdout to a debug window or to your own window. 
Aside from using `None` as a null value, I very rarely have one variable that can be multiple different types depending on control flow.
Any time you use a list or dict...
Yoo!!! I literally did this😂😂
The file under /proc/net/route that holds the routing table is probably the best way to find the active interface. The default route will be associated with the active interface.
Maybe selecting `{}` as the opening and closing characters for sets originally was a poor decision. It could have been pipes or something from the beginning. I also fully understand curly braces is consistent with sets in mathematics, so I get what the intent was. 
Yeah, I saw it on the code but that is of no consequence. I think if you are going to use a tool, no matter how trivial, that is going to tell you if it's going to rain, you would like to know if it's actually correct more than 50% of the time, no?
/r/learnpython 
Nice thanks for the info as well. Looks like the language got even easier to comprehend. Cool!
Can you save the image path as an attribute, instead of saving the image file contents? Then just read the file when you need it?

The distinction between lambda and function is really one of intent. By defining a function I give it a name. I say it is this thing for this purpose. It can be used in it's own. With a lambda, in saying it doesn't have it's own purpose. It is auxiliary to something else. It is intended to be an argument to a functor. Python in general is really ambivalent when it comes to functional programming. You can define functions anywhere, and pass them as objects... that's all really pro-functional. But when you want to make clear that something is really only intended as a functor argument you can't because "no multiline lambda." I don't really get it. 
Pipes were already operators so that would have been extremely confusing if not syntactically impossible.
This was an intentionally design decision in order to allow exceptions to continue to work.
Have you tried some MacOSX subreddit? 
Google "python tutorial" and you should find lots of pages. Just omit those talking about snake breeding. 
Just my opinion, your mileage may vary but..... I think 2.X will be alive and embedded in business code for awhile. We've been predicting Cobol's death for decades. My advice is to learn 3 but understand the gotchas of 2.X.
This is what I mean by it being luck. Where I work (as a developer/engineer/whatever), who does the first screen depends on what level the job is and how many applicants there are. If it is a low level position or one with hundreds of applicants, HR or a 3rd party will do the first screen, basically as you describe, and the successful ones are passed to engineers for a technical screen. Otherwise HR don't screen and it goes straight to the engineers for a technical screen. But even at a technical screen, you may still have a lot of CVs to go through so there needs to be something interesting enough on the CV to make it worth browsing GitHub.

Literally the whole idea behind an API is that the people providing it define how you interact with it. So there is no generic tutorial.
Btw, how do you do these nice-looking screenshots? 
Oh I see, I am quite unfamiliar with the terminology or usage so I don't even know where to start. Do you have any book suggestions for where I can learn how to use Python to interact with it then? I guess that's more something like i'm looking for. 
Yes, you should do python 3. For what it's worth, though, lpthw has been python 3 since at least 2010 (I first used it back then and I've never used python 2, I specifically remember it recommending python 3). I didn't know there was a python 2 version, so it must be quite old
Good work buddy! Have you tried creating a git repository for your code? Might be good experience to try and deploy it to github and track any modifications
I've recently stumbled upon [tailrec](https://github.com/ac1235/python-tailrec) (but haven't checked it out yet).
I actually in the process of doing so :) I’m new to github, so it’s an interesting learning experience 🐍 
Alexa actually already does this.
To clarify: The "image" is an attribute of an object. The object is saved in a text file as all of its attributes including the image. The image is saved as nullImage, and so when converted to a string it becomes "nullImage". So when I import it I get it as "nullImage" and not nullImage like I need it. How do I get it back?
You and me the same...
wow itertools is awesome I didn't even know about that one. Thank you !!!!!
Thanks, I've spotted some other similar projects. I'm afraid these ad hoc solutions will always hurt the performance though. 
Thank you !!!
You are talking about programming, not Python, right? It really depends on how you learn. I didn't like reading docs nor watching courses. The most fun you'll have learning is when building your own small starter projects. E.g. to-do lists, calculator, agenda, web server, whatever but make it your own.
I don't think you're taking the issue from the right end, if you're not fond of it, you're not fond of it. That's perfectly fine, we don't all like the same things. There is no recipe to like something you don't like. That being said, you could try experimenting on your own, trying to code a personal project. Maybe you'd like it more if you get a functional and useful/funny actual program out of it.
In order for tail call optimization to actually optimize things, it has to throw away the frame. That is the whole point. But the frame is exactly what is needed in order to have meaningful traceback information in an exception. So by throwing away the frame you are throwing away what is needed to diagnose bugs, and this can happen inadvertently by people who don't know anything about tail calls. So Guido [decided not to allow it](https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html) in the reference CPython implementation, although other Python implementation can choose to use it.
That would be a massive backwards-compatibility break, though.
In early versions of LPTHW, ZS threw quite a bit of crap at Py3 and actively steered his readers away from it. Some may have been justified, but he couched it in so much irrelevant CS mumbo-jumbo that he just came out looking foolish. I have not actively coded in Py2 for about 4 years now, and only touch it infrequently because I maintain an open source lib that still supports back to Py2.6. But dropping Py2 is definitely on my roadmap, and I eagerly await that day. All the latest ML and AI hotness is going to be Py3, so best to formulate those Py3 coding habits now, and just dredge up Py2 idiosyncracies if/when they ever crop up.
Probably you should see what you’re studying _in action_. This may amaze you (because theory is pretty boring) - and boom - you’re really fond of it. If it still doesn’t make you like it, then... this is it: you don’t really like it, and it’s not a problem. Do you _need_ what you’re studying? If yes - just go on. Otherwise you should probably drop that and try something else. But again: not being fond of something is fine, and you don’t need to force yourself to like it, just go on with the flow or bail out and embark on a new journey. 
That's actually a better explanation of what's going on

The ljust() method of the built-in string type accepts a fill character as an optional parameter. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.ljust
I am a beginner when it comes to programming, so take my advice however you want. I don't believe anyone is too dumb for anything, if another person can achieve it then so can you. Instead of backing yourself into a corner by thinking you're, "dumb" ask yourself instead, is this learning method right for me? Am I putting in the amount of work necessary to get the results I expect? Am I actively engaged in learning, or am I just distracted all through-out the lessons? Do I have a goal and a plan to get this goal? Analyze which areas you're failing in and make adjustments, also understand that everything takes time and daily effort. Good luck with your studies!
Yes, immediately apply to Soylent for the job position "ingredient". I kid. I suspect your main problem is the belief that coding from scratch defines a smart programmer. I've been coding Python for over a decade and I never pass up the chance to use examples, code snippets, recycled code etc. Grab examples, lash them together and get them working. The critical point is, at that point, work through the code and understand how and why it works. If you miss the last step you end up being a Cargo Cult programmer. The other advantage of working out how code works is that when you have the moment when you grasp the code, it sticks with you. Actually, in the real world you're much more likely to be reverse engineering, debugging, and augmenting existing code. This is especially true with Python since existing module functionality usually calls routines coded down to the bare metal. Even if you are incredibly clever, writing a sort routine is likely to end up and order of magnitude slower than those in the standard libraries. 
I guess that might be what is required to fix this issue then.

If you "have no expectations of being a programmer" and are "finding the language very straight forward" what's the problem? Sounds like you are doing fine so far. If you want to improve just keep doing it.
The endless obsession of programmers wanting to type everything, breaking every old library in existence. Maybe it's a numpy thing. For example: numpy.array('string1').tostring() + str('string2') gives an error because the first half is not a string in python 3 and a = np.ones(10)\*1 b = np.arange(10)\*2 (so a = \[10,10,10...., 10\] and b = 2\*\[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\] index = b/2 a\[index\] gives an error because index is not an integer but a\[index.astype(numpy.int)\] is fine and a\[int(index)\] is fine &amp;#x200B; I would like the unnecessary software rot to stop. Python was better when it enabled flexibility. If you need strong typing, don't force it on the rest of us. This is the road to push users away. It's breaking all sorts of very useful old code. And I will be downvoted for or argued against due to this position. 
Dynamic typing was why I started with Python. It was always a feature, and I built in the dynamic logic into everything I did. I understood when I would need static typing, and used it appropriately. I'm told I'm a bad programmer because I liked dynamic typing. I think exactly the opposite. The whole point is the simplify as much as possible to the end user, not complicate their lives. Complicated code should rot faster than simple code. I am too passionate about this, but that's because the static typing is beginning to break far too many things that I'd rather not have to fix. This may make me consider other languages, after so many years of finding python very useful.
Breaks like that simply aren't going to happen. We are talking about something that goes all the way back to the very first release, 0.9.0. It would break practically all substantial Python code ever written in a way that can be hard to find and diagnose. 
Try Clojure.org, I was lost for years in the OOP world until I tried functional programming. IMO OOP is a mistake because objects are entities too big to work as "bricks".
what you're wanting takes time my friend. stick with it and the freedom you desire will come gradually. 
it takes years to become proficient at programming
Dash use react for frontend, flask as backend. You write the layout in python and the components renders in react.
I think what people don't seem to understand about programming it's much like being a pro gamer or a professional athlete. It just takes hard work and daily practice. If you write a little bit every day even if it's copy and paste from the internet you're still building out that skill set. Each extra line is that extra rep that extra shot. Just keep grinding on it and you could become one of the very best! 
`tostring` is poorly named, but the fact of the matter is that raw bytes are not equivalent to strings, they are raw data. That data can contain strings of various sorts, but could be anything else as well. Assuming that bytes are meant to represent not only strings, but a particular type of string, is not a good assumption. And there are good reasons for not allowing floats as indices, either. What should be the index you would get if you used `np.sum(0.3*np.ones(10))`? It looks like it should obviously be 3, since `0.3*10=3`, but it is actually `2` because of floating-point issues. So just blindly truncating floats to integers the way numpy used to do it isn't safe. The user should explicitly do the conversion in a way that is appropriate for their data. 
Yeah... Python always has it... but if you are talking a little bit of a more OO language like, say Kotlin... then yes I try to when possible. Although mutability can get a little muddy when complexity increases.
Nice, I'm right there with you. I just started class about a month ago. Hope it goes well for you

First, this belongs in /r/learnpython But anyway, you have to be more clear. At the top of your script, you do **not** want to do: sys.path.append('/path/to/dir') unless you will only ever run it once and non-interactively. Instead do: if '/path/to/dir' not in sys.path: sys.path.append('/path/to/dir') But, really, you do not want to work this way. You should install what you need, make virtualenv's etc. (with that said, I do this too!)
`|A, B| | |C, A|` Yeah that's not ideal. 
Take a look at the requests library. Many APIs follow a similar pattern: send an HTTP request to a URI and receive a JSON blob in response. Find a free API (weather maybe?) to practice on then build a simple script to send requests and consume responses. 
We could use ∅ but unicode isn't allowed in the standard library.
How come I get errors when I do the slash for a line break In Jupyter ? 
In 2, unicode was easily ignored. That was fine because most coders never needed to deal with it. (Seriously, NEVER.) But some few people needed unicode support, so now EVERYBODY has to deal with the added overhead (Learn to enjoy typing u' on strings, kiddies!) of unicode, even though hardly anybody needs them. This is progress?
Why does it seem like you hardcoded everything? &amp;#x200B;
You use while loops to keep looping until it reaches a certain condition. I often use it for pagation myself.

IT WOULD HELP IF YOU POSTED THE ERRORS YOU'RE GETTING. IT WOULD ALSO HELP IF YOU POSTED YOUR FULL CODE.
Wow that looks so simple, delicious python

TIL. Thanks!
Usually never, except maybe in a generator function you want to continuously yield from.
thanks, i hate it
b=list(range(1,a.count(-1)+1))
Something like "key=def foo(x): ..." ?

replacing a lot of our node.js applications with django
I feel really dumb asking this, but I'm just getting into notebooks. Why is &gt;y==5?
Maybe use \n
Django is the wordpress of python web frameworks, imo. Fine for a monolithic service, but if you want scalable microservice architecture and agile development, you want to use flask, pyramid, etc. Flask is great because it's so minimal and really easy to shove into a lambda (via zappa) for a completely serverless python api. Then you write a frontend in an SPA like vuejs and throw it in s3 and you can serve frontend and backend and be totally serverless.

More difficult to chain. Compare something like reduce(combine_two, map(add_one, filter(is_baz, my_list))) to my_list.filter(is_baz) .map(add_one) .reduce(combine_two) (Apologies for the formatting, I'm on mobile) I find the latter much more readable. Things are laid out in the order that the operations take place, and you don't have to dive into crazy amounts of nesting to figure out what's going on. This becomes more of an issue with more complex expressions than the example of course.

As I said in my other reply to this thread, imagine if you had to review a few hundred applications for a job - would you go to each GitHub link to check the quality of the programming? Or an alternative way to look at it, imagine you have 200 applications for 1 entry level position, 150 have degrees from top end institutes and 50 have no qualification. What is the incentive to code review 50 GitHub repositories when 150 applicants have already been assessed for you? Morally, you should check every application in as much detail as possible, but realistically there are massive time pressures that force you to be pragmatic. Here's a real world example. In a previous company, I was helping to do the first screen for an entry level position, and I had about 100 applications to review in 1 afternoon (call it 4 hours). That gave me about 2.4 minutes per application to open and read the CV, cover letter, make a decision and complete a feedback form. That is not a lot of time to go digging around GitHub. Yes, it really is that much a production line, and this wasn't even at a particularly large company. Where I work now, I don't even see most of the applications because they are prescreened by a non-technical recruiter with a checklist. It is a shit system, but it's the way it works in a lot of places. I'm sorry this isn't the answer that you were hoping for. The silver lining is that not everywhere is like this. The caveat is that this is only my personal experience. Experiences will vary. They are all equally valid.
I wouldn't say I'm missing it, Bob :)
80 char length is the only pep 8 warning that bugs me.
Bad bot
It's very bad. The 79 chars line limit especially doesn't make sense with the rest of the rules it imposes. It leads to horribly unreadable code. Especially coming from other languages. Pep8 is awfully outdated and needs to be replaced with some more modern and sensible.
Making a drop in replacement Web server replacement for my thermostat. I already wrote a read-only proxy that feeds the info to mqtt.
huh? Some little explanation of "why and what's the reason for" would be be good. Like, I know a little about QThreads and the QApplication event-loop, and have heard of asyncio, but am very suspicious of trying to mash-up two different models of multi-threading.
3 and 4 have always been a bit puzzling to me co.ing from other languages.
I'd suggest that Python would be better if it were just deleted... 
The biggest issue is the webcrawler giving ad links instead of video links.
Take a look into youtube-dl, it might solve that issue for you. 
Physics PhD can confirm, we dump batshit code on the code monkeys all the time 
I’m surprised nobody has mentioned kivy considering it’s cross platform and is meant for mobile devices. I’m learning it and it has a learning curve, but I think it’s pretty nice.

It's a symbiotic relationship
I bought a server and domain for the first time too. :D
This makes sense. I appreciate the honesty. It certainly helps. I’m considering studying in the Information Technology bachelors from online (they call it “anywhere”) at Northeastern University CPS as well as taking a bootcamp (possibly right before I start the degree...) However, I noticed all the bootcamps are JavaScript development instead of Python C++ Java etc... I’m unaware of there are other bootcamps for preparation into say the video game industry. 
Instead of rolling your own timing code, use `timeit` from the stdlib that works hard to eliminate some variables you might not think of and make the results as comparable as possible (eg, it disables garbage collection, and it repeats each averaging-loop multiple times to factor out anomalies related to your OS' process scheduling): $ python3 -m timeit -s 'a = [ 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]' '[a[:i+1].count(-1) for i,z in enumerate(a)]' 100000 loops, best of 3: 2.43 usec per loop $ python3 -m timeit -s 'a = [ 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]; from numpy import cumsum,array' 'cumsum(array(a) == -1).tolist()' 100000 loops, best of 3: 9.65 usec per loop $ python3 -m timeit -s 'a = [ 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]; from itertools import accumulate' 'list(accumulate(int(x==-1) for x in a))' 1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.95 usec per loop numpy is *considerably* slower here, probably because for such a small amount of data, the cost of constructing the array dominates over the saving from its faster algorithms.
The 80 character limit actually works pretty perfectly for me. It allows me to have two sets of code side-by-side on the same monitor. And frankly lines that are too long are a code smell. But it is one of those people recommendations that is a weaker one that can be broken when there situation calls for it. But in my opinion that should be an exception rather than a rule.
You could use flask to create the page. 
Congrats! I have always wanted to give pygame a try.
It's really amazing how fast you can pull together a site with Flask. Love it. 
It would have been much easier to hook into an API, I am sure there is one out there. Hard-coding everything is bad practice.
What are those?

That wasn't the point, but ok. xD
Yeah, it took around 10 hours all together. I spent around 2 hours on the code and the rest on CSS and deployment. I made it super easy to write blog posts and add games.
Web frameworks that are the used the most in python. If you would like to port this to a web page and do it in python then you will want to start with Flask / Django.
No, it wasn't but I thought I would pay a compliment anyway. I will refrain from doing that in the future.
Let me try again, then, since that wasn't up to your standards: nice deploy mate. Well done, 10/10.
They congratulated you and then said that they want to try using the tools you use for game Dev and that was your response? 
I was very annoyed by this too. I'm using Quart + Hypercorn (Flask + Gunicorn drop-in replacements) for my http2 apps 
I wasn't trying to be rude, sorry if it came off that way.
You did. When someone congratulates you and then tries to make conversation, the default reply shouldn't be 'tHaT wAsNt tHe pOiNt".
Here's some of the rationale for 3: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/ 
Regarding 3) I've seen chatter on PythonDev that there's increasing support for a `match` statement similiar to Rust's symatics if you've seen that: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-September/155284.html 
&gt; "While lightweight and easy to use, Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn't scale well and by default serves only one request at a time." FYI Flask is not for production. 
Yeah, I used uWSGI for that.
Yeah, you read that a little wrong- running flask as the server isn’t for production, but you can (and it’s good at) use it for the web framework- just use something like uwsgi to serve it.
/r/learnpython But it doesn't matter: if you don't understand the algorithm itself, learning any number of programming languages won't help you.
Is the Dungeon game procedurally generated?
That looks nice, will check out in the future. Do the imports get factored into the timing?
Really? A Django site takes me 2 minutes. It's nice you just `django-admin startproject mysite`
Yes. It has a bunch of area presets and it stacks them together as needed. :D
I just send a text file to the server and it does the rest. The text file looks somewhat like a markdown post and is handled similarly. The games are the same too. I just send it a media link, description, and title. It generates a preview on the games page and a full page dedicated to the game.
I’ve been programming every day for the past 4 years, I’ve never once needed a do while block.
I am not sure which framework I would like to get started with Django or Flask?
Huh, that's smart. I have been trying to figure out how to do easy blog on Flask.
I wrote a function that returns a blog entry (inside a dedicated div class so it's stylized properly). I can just use multiples of those for the blog pages (there's 1 right now, but it shows 5 per page and has buttons to flip between them where applicable). The blog entries themselves are read from text files and converted into HTML along with the necessary tags for things like italics, links, headers, etc..
you need to reinstall python with sqlite3 module
