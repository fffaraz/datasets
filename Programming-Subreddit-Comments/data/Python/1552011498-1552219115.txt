Try to make it a class or function tomorrow. When I first started out I would make all sorts of silly programs, many as classes, just to learn what the language looked like.
Because I was bored: import re import inspect def debugify(func): ignored = ('def', 'class', 'else', 'except') filename = inspect.getsourcefile(func) lines, line_num = inspect.getsourcelines(func) new_source = [] for line in lines: line = line.strip('\n') if not line.startswith('@debugify'): m = re.search('^(\s+)(.*)$', line) if m: whitespace = m.group(1) code = m.group(2) if not any(code.startswith(x) for x in ignored): new_source.append('{ws}print("{file}:line {num}")'.format(ws=whitespace, file=filename, num=line_num)) new_source.append(line) line_num += 1 exec(compile('\n'.join(new_source), '&lt;debugify&gt;', 'single')) return locals()[func.__name__] @debugify def foo(a): b = 0 for c in range(3): if a % 2 == 0: b += 6 else: b -= 2 return a + b foo(7) --- &gt; python debugify.py debugify.py:line 25 debugify.py:line 26 debugify.py:line 27 debugify.py:line 30 debugify.py:line 27 debugify.py:line 30 debugify.py:line 27 debugify.py:line 30 debugify.py:line 31 1
I'll shoot you something tonight if possible along with a lot of comments explaining my logic. Also, I don't think of it as an hour to write that script - I see it as an hour invested in learning something new. Think of it as giving yourself a raise. 
can you share the link? Why is this better than pythonanywhere.com?

Wait, is it really?
Not compared to the Python ecosystem.
We're at 3.7 so let's see how long it takes.
Heh, if you talk to [this guy](https://powerpivotpro.com/2015/06/no-more-apologies-excel-is-the-worlds-best-data-tool-period/) he claims that the best data analysis tool in the world is Excel (so much so a Microsoft-owned blog wouldn't even print his article). He's also run a piece that maintains that [PowerBI bests R for many things](https://powerpivotpro.com/2017/08/power-bi-dax-m-vs-r-summer-perspective/).
why not just: list = \[x + 10 for x in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\]
You could try string formatting. `print('You would need {sum} cups'.format(cups=cups))` And perhaps use a library to get the current month and output the sum for this month as well as the next? I've found the best way to learn is to see how far you can take something mundane and keep doing whatever you can think of with it.
Because that isn't a while loop. I know this way is much simpler and I prefer it this way, but my professor wants it as a while loop.
I would advise the opposite, don't use relational databases until there's a reason to

Is your python backend implemented in some kind of framework like flask or django? How does it listen for and repond to requests to process an image?
Welcome! The new literacy standard -- reading, writing, and coding. Coding is now as important as reading and writing in 1850.
I don't like your professor. At all. The following is one way you could do it, but not the only way, I suppose. Alist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] while True: index = 0 try: Alist[index] += 10 index += 1 except IndexError: break 
"sum = (cup * day * month / box)" Be careful with this line of code. You just overwrote a built-in function, [sum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum). Maybe try using a different variable name? Anyway, the start of a journey begins with a single step. Go for it. :)
I know I disagree heavily with the way he wants us to do it too. I tried what you provided and it just put my program in an infinite loop for some reason. I am using Python 3.6 IDLE if that matters.

I edited it right after to move the index variable out of the while loop :)
Wow I had the same issue today. Are you using Anaconda? Here's how I fixed it. Basically PowerBI doesn't like python 3.7 in anaconda flavour. Open a new command prompt (or anaconda prompt) and create a new Python environment: conda create -p C:\Path\to\anaconda3\envs\mypowerbienvironment python=3.6 anaconda Once its done, go into power bi settings, python script settings, select "other" for Python version then navigate to the the root of the environment folder you just created. The scripts should now work and you can start complaining about how terrible it is to write python code in power bi. There's no introspection or experimentation. Ill stick to jupyter. If not using anaconda, juts try using an older install of Python. 
Oh maybe that's why it went into a infinite loop for me at first haha. Do you mind if I PM you to bother you about one more question I have?
I've never really understood what decorators actually do and your boredom code helped me get it a little bit. I don't think that was your intention, but thank you.
I’m sorry but that’s just plain crazy. The people who told you that are the exact same type of people who said the internet is a fad. I’m serious... people with the “X new thing is a waste of time” mentality are really out of place in the tech field. It indicates an unwillingness to learn new technology which is an immediate red flag for a dev. You only have to look at what any modern software is doing to see that it’s an incredibly relevant platform. That aside, I think OP was talking about lambda as a python function ;)
3.7.2. So only 28 more versions to go
Oh god, don't learn from this! Decorators are functions that return functions. That's pretty much it. It's common to wrap the original function in another one that does something before or after.
FWIW CodeSandbox already has VS Code in the browser. 
8 is out now for testing already
&gt;you don't actually need the explicit None here - get defaults to using None as the default if no argument is provided. Oh, that's cool - I think I sometimes get `dict.get` and `operator.itemgetter` confused, so I err on the side of `None`\-safety.
I love seeing semantic versioning hit .10 As in, after python 3.9 we may get 3.10 then 3.11 [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/) Funnily enough, I'd say the use of a \`.\` as a seperator in semantic version is... bad semantics, it looks like a decimal point, and was used as such in other versioning schemes.
Not sure if that math adds up.
you could use pipes in Java to work between both.
And as of 3.6 you can use f-strings! ``` print(f"You would need {sum} cups") ```
Sorry but this is wrong. Python is going to be more useful for heavy statistics and predictive analysis, but in terms of descriptive, diagnostic, and presentation a tool like PowerBI, which can be supplemented by python/R is going to take you much farther. You’d be silly to completely discount the usefulness of a BI tool to complement your python tools. 
Nice work on that script! Looks clean
I’m not talking amazon lambda, I’m talking python lambda. For some people (me) they are hard to read. I think it’s an old school thing. I’d rather have it all spelled out in a normal function. Of course I know I just haven’t gotten to the point where I need them and it clicks.
This would be a great post for /r/learnpython !
Ohhhh. I get that. Don’t know why I jumped to the other conclusion! Apologies!
How about? ```python Alist = [1,2,3,4,5] index = 0 while index &lt; len(Alist): Alist[index] += 10 index += 1 ``` 
I mean, that's how people always explain it, and that does make sense. Although your last sentence was the most helpful explanation I've seen, even though I'm assuming that's not the only purpose. I can comprehend what a decorator does, but I don't know why it does it or when it should do it. Examples found in tutorials and textbooks are always too silly or simple and I never really take away the point. Seeing code a real person wrote, even if it was as a joke, is really helpful. I should say that I've never really tried to learn about decorators as I've never needed to use them. I didn't really understand any of it until I had to, if that makes any sense. I was just about to ask you a few questions, to see if I was understanding the concept. But as I wrote them down, I went back to your example and was able to answer them myself. That's because it serves a purpose and it's complicated enough for me to even have questions in the first place! I can't claim I've "learned decorators" from a reddit comment but I do feel more capable if I encounter them out there in the wild.

Not enough there for a class IMO, a function makes sense though.
Start reading the TensorFlow Python API documentation
You might want to check out [huey](https://github.com/coleifer/huey/blob/master/README.rst), [RQ](https://python-rq.org/), and Celery. 
sure
Yeah, that would be better. Less try/except blocks is faster I think.
If it helps, when narrating the line, read "lambda" as "given" and the (first) colon as "return."
Yeah... I'm 43 and just starting to learn. You're never too old for new tricks! *especially if you still have 20+ years of work ahead of you! :P

If you just want to practice SQL and relational design, start with SQLite. Running a database is system administration, a good skill but not related to programming.
Worked on a pcap parser to identify some miss behaving syslog packets. Basically a fancy time delta processing script.
Nice work, you're never too old to learn something new. Speaking of which, you should take a look at working with venv once you're up to that. I've found it super handy for some portability between environments. Happy coding!
You don't know what you're talking about. 
If you ever plan on exposing this to the Internet in any way — even if you’re going to make it “private” — I’d strongly recommend against trying to roll your own web service using just the standard library. The security implications alone make using an established framework a baseline requirement. If this is just a toy you’re only going to run locally, though, go wild. It a great way to learn (and appreciate) what other frameworks are doing for you behind the scenes.

We use Mongo. It's good. But I don't know enough to suggest it over some other options. 
You all think there will be Python 4, but who's to say Python version won't go up to, say, 3.142? :)
Postgres
Yeah I decided to go with this one because it looked neater. Funny thing is I got the while line exactly as you but then didn't know how to put the rest in terms of python. Thanks!
If your first skill isn't programming but you have to make code, python is the path of least resistance. Engineers, statisticians, data scientists, none of these kinds of professionals want to spend lots of time mastering C. Python is super easy and the libraries like numpy and matplotlib make it easier.
Congrats. I’ve been learning for 1 month. I envy you. 
Vete, spammer!
You’re young. Lol. This isn’t 1819. 😅
Yes, this is not a good practice. This will just dump all the installed packages that your current script may not even use.. A better way is to really just put the package names if you dont know the version number. By default pip gathers the latest version. Or a better way for getting version is a write a small function to generate pip file in the *__name__ = "__main__"* area. And run the pip command before your other functions start. I did this with one script and it's better than asking users to do a pip -r requitements..txt and whatever. Give users more freedom. Automate it all.
LOL Yes and no... I'm young--until I'm applying for an IT opening against 30 other applicants who are all 25 or younger... **Literally happened to me last year. I was the oldest applicant by 18 years. 
Have you tried Google?
That's not a Python documentation.
What are you processing?
I was just making myself feel better. I’m 46. Lol. I know what you mean. I’m the oldest on my team. 🤦🏽‍♂️
But it will point you to literally billions of resources, like tutorials, online learning sites, blog posts, videos, demonstrations, evenly code snippets, GitHub repos, etc.
True, but I wouldn't be asking it here if I wanted to use Google. I'm just hoping that someone knows an excellent alternative resource on the subject of import system. Google is not guaranteed to give you an excellent resource on the subject.
Neither is here, clearly. Google is literally the most advanced knowledge-finding system that mankind has ever made. I've been coding for a decade and still use it dozens if times a day. I world recommend getting more comfortable with it. There are also some resources in the side bar that I would recommend.
Well, if someone already knows an excellent alternative resource, then my post here is totally worth it. I don't have anything against Google, and my post here is just to improve my chances of finding a good resource.
Hey man, what's the speed of this? I'm currently using PIL for Low Quality Image Placeholders and I would like to try using a Single Color Placeholder for lazy load to check if there's any improvement.
&gt; You just overwrote a built-in function typical programmer start to monkey patch his code without knowing!
I use pip-tools to keep requirements.txt both up to date and clean. The disadvantage of pip freeze is that it will freeze all installed packages and dependencies. So you can easily lose track which packages you really need. 
 class Main: @classmethod def main(cls): print(f'{cls}') if __name__ == '__main__': Main.main()
Awesome.
Yup, my point exactly. Also Go is python for googlers that google controls, really no reason for anyone outside the company to use it
Why? the real round number it's crearly 4.0.1
mmm, is there a way for `Main.main()` to be declared a `@classmethod` after creating the class? eg, invalid syntax: def main(cls): print(f'{cls}') class Main: @classmethod main = main ... File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3 main = main ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax or class Main: pass Main.main = main # how to add @classmethod wrapper?
The real irony is I am the *youngest* on my current team! I'm a Mainframe Infrastructure operator. But, advancement is null and long term security is in question. So, teaching myself coding it is!
Yes I do
 L = None while not L: L = \[x + 10 for x in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\] Easy as pie :)
Did you already try changing the cell display format?
I would advise the opposite, don't use relational databases until there's a reason to. What's being built here that requires a relationship model vs simple document storage?
I'm holding off for Python 6. 
Python 3 uses nearest-even rounding. The number of bugs this introduced is... a \*lot\*. &amp;#x200B; That said, I'm very happy there's another developer in the world! Python 3 is great! Enjoy!
not really but I am trying to get in touch with it, my focus is the performance difference and scaleability in comparison to MQTT
rpy2 seemed to only work with older version of R.....has anyone figure out how to make rpy2 work with R 3.5 above?

Isn't putting spaces between brackets and arguments against pep8 convention?
I'd take 10 of you over the 20 something's I fucking interview. Signed ~ a guy younger than you (not by much, but apparently years matter)
I agree with the last post. As someone that has worked on excel in python recently. Format the column in excel then when you read it in the parse will pick it up. You may need to use a custom format if this has msec in it.
In your opinion, perhaps. 
We have a micro services architecture, so it’s easier, but always by hand. You choose what packages you need and that’s it. No point specifying all packages with each dependency, only the ones you actively import. Pipdeptree is used to check compatibility and pylint will check for unused imports etc. If we use a package that’s not well maintained and changes requirements within the version etc, we get find a replacement or write one ourselves 
You know your project, so explicitly type the requirements. When you want to upgrade a package, bump a number.
taking a class on R this semester, any hints, warnings, etc?
What is this? I've never seen this before and Google seems to not know either. Unless it's satire :/
It is satire, sorry.
I was thinking of making models in a program and using Python to run tests, find most efficient ratios, drag etc. I understand that this probably isn't the easiest task but its a project that I would work on for the next 2 years or so. 
keep at it, you'll only get better with time. I've polished it for you [https://pastebin.com/9itd5zUq](https://pastebin.com/9itd5zUq)
Yeah, been toying with this on-off for couple of days couple of hours here and there, but managed to finally get a grip on it, I had been pondering on changing cell display format, but it wouldn't make any sense till now. &amp;#x200B; Thanks, was quite a lot easier than it felt like couple of hours back!
Can you describe most precisely what you want your program to do?
the input will be a list of shortcuts and the output will be the mening of thim i hope u understand me \^\^
What have you tried so far? What's annoying you? This seems like homework or at best a challenge from hackerrank, so it seems silly to give the answer here, but I'm sure we can give you advice on the step you're at. 
What if I fill in “not a number”? Or 9999999999999999999999999999999999?
I use something that we call dictionary in french, it's maybe that the correct translation, look for intel :p (It bind two value like a word and is definition, or like you want, a shortcut and a description)
`classmethod` is a decorator, so you would do this: class Main: main = classmethod(main) or Main.main = classmethod(main) The `@` is just syntactic sugar for exactly this.
i want a code python u must make it no dictionary i know my english so bad to explain clearly
You can use something like that https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp And if you don't want to use dictionaries, you can use a simple list
Yeah, I use await asyncio.sleep to avoid overcalling the API because judging on the info on the API page they are heavy handed in banning people. Ive been looking around to see if i can find where they are pulling their data from but not had any luck so far
thanks for the replay I tried several different things and it seems I'm getting away from the solution... :) last try: def moveHighest(muList, endIndex): maxNum = 0 for pos, values in enumerate(muList[:endIndex:]): if values &gt; maxNum: maxNum = values maxNum[] print(values) it's a mess... I guess what's bothering me now is: when I find the max number (I know how to do that).... how do I get the position of that same number? this is a bit of code I found that I'm planning to use for swapping the numbers: temp = alist[fillslot] alist[fillslot] = alist[positionOfMax] alist[positionOfMax] = temp &amp;#x200B;
Some more awesomeness but for `django`-specific packages: https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template But, tools and mechanisms used there can be applied to other projects as well.
Happy cake day
Thank you!
That's actually a clever way to read them !
We all have to start somewhere. Good luck.
I think the biggest hurdle is going to be raw computation power. AFAIK, to get anything remotely realistic out of such a physics simulation, in 3D, with arbitrary shapes fed in, and you want the results this year, you'll need a rather massive cluster. There's a good reason why aircraft designers still use physical wind tunnels, after all. So I'd also look into other approaches; there are more "opinionated" models around that take parametrized aircraft shapes, rather than arbitrary 3D meshes, and those require a lot less computation power, at the expense of being reliable only for relatively conventionally shaped aircraft using well-known airfoil shapes, and flying within a normal envelope.
Keel evolving the script to learn even more, a fun one would be ask what month it was and progmatically work out the number of days
 that the 52 locations in 24-2 are set 6 degrees away from each other and 2 degrees off the centre up/ down and right/left. if that helps
No for loops, just sapply and lapply. Everything is a vector. The tidyverse is nice. 
Why the hell anyone would do that?!
I'm not sure the jump from 3 to 4 will be massive like 2 to 3 was.
I use Python daily. What exactly am I missing by not using R? (serious question)
Yes so this is better if it’s just a function that needs to trigger when something happens in your app and not some kind of web framework like Django, as someone else mentioned. It’s serverless and probably more responsive than pythonanywhere if you’re just triggering that function. Here’s some AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-invocation-modes.html and here’s a video where I set up a lambda to run every hour or so. https://youtu.be/oL5mLkZj9QA You can have it trigger directly from the app or when a file is pushed to a bucket or...there are lots of ways to trigger it. Good luck.
It assigns the successive values of a in the loop to the last element of a. That's why you get two times "o" at the end, the n was replaced by p, y, t, h, o in the previous iterations. Also /r/learnpython
On every iteration you assign the next value in `a` to `a[-1]`. See what happens if you do: for a[-1] in a: print(a) 
Firstly, as per the other comment - why do you want to do this? What your second loop is doing is assigning each letter in a to the last character of a, basically: &amp;#x200B; for i in a: a\[-1\] = i &amp;#x200B; So if you were to print a in each loop it would go: pythop pythoy pythot pythoh pythoo pythoo (because the last letter is now 'o') 
Nothing in particular. R is just way more popular in the less programming-inclined world. I don't think R has any feature Python couldn't offer.
the `for i in a` statement is iterating over `a` and assigning each element to the local variable `i`. the second loop `for a[-1] in a` assigns each element to the last element of the list `a`. &amp;#x200B; you can see more clearly what is happening if you print(a) each loop: for a[-1] in a: print(a) print(a[-1]) print() which outputs ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'p'] p ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'y'] y ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 't'] t ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'h'] h ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'o'] o ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'o'] o &amp;#x200B;
It was just a brain teaser sorta thing that a friend asked.
A few things really. I'm getting the data ready for the next stages of a few projects. Right now I'm just writing code to parse a page in the wikimedia xml dump, then I'm splitting them up into smaller files so going to a specific page is faster. Then building a light index [ArticleX,LineNumber,FileNumber] with a secondary index of outgoing links Y,Z... The processing is building towards figuring out how to make word embeddings, because I want the python helper bot to measure the simplicity of a question based on how similar a question is to multiple stack overflow posts. Rather than keyword matching, I just plan on mapping the posts to a vector, then comparing it to similarly profiled SO posts. 
thanks, I sort of understood yet not sure. If you could please help me out with my query here. (sorry this is probably very simple thing) when we do for i in a it mean every element of a gets assigned to i - I understood this much, so here the list a is not getting updated. but when we do for a[-1] in a: why the list is getting updated. This means every time it should print 'n' as it is the last element of the list. &amp;#x200B; Thank you. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It is always fun to see how people solve simple life problems with 10 lines of code. I wish I would've used Python in school when young. The interactive Python is just so useful for simple math. 
wee... solved it: def moveHighest(muList, endIndex): maximum = 0 for x in muList[:endIndex:]: if x &gt; maximum: maximum = x muList[muList.index(maximum)], muList[endIndex - 1] = muList[endIndex - 1], maximum return muList &amp;#x200B;
This sounds very promising, thanks for sharing! Im going for work right now, so in a couple of hours i will try it. I am sorry if you already know this, but you can change the data types with python, maybe that can help. Are you facing this problem with visualisations or importing data from scripts? Glad to help if I can, and thanks a lot again for the tip!
Look at the magic methods in jupyter notebooks. You can write python cells and r cells and pass values between them. Jupyter is was even named as such because it's meant for Julia, Python and R.
Do you have a fixed schedule for checking for package updates?
I looked into pip-tools, and found pipenv as well. Would you saying pipenv is a better solution?
Not super familiar with these libraries but I'm guessing the value of pair["@key"] is "commandName" and "commandName"["#text"] will produce that error, so what you probably want is just pair[#text] or something? But more importantly, you should develop a problem solving approach that allows you to work through situations like this. Use a debugger or the interpreter to get to the point in the code where your script crashes and test out what the values of various sub-expressions so you can see what's causing the error.
Sure. Don't worry. sql = remove_chars_between_string(sql, '&lt;script&gt;', '&lt;/script&gt;') The intention of this piece of code is to sanitise user input. If any, we have limit control on the content of user input. Adversarial actors may insert malicious content into our system through forms or calling our web api's in a direct fashion. This content could contain sql to achieve [sql injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp), or maybe javascript in order to achieve [xss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Obviously, this poses a security threat and we want to prevent this from happening. The implementation chosen here is wrong for at least two reasons: 1. It's broken 2. It's in the wrong place **Why is it broken?** To explain why it is broken we need to understand what it is we are trying to prevent. Therefor I want to show a very simple example of Cross-site Scripting (xss). Let's consider the following html page: &lt;html&gt; &lt;div&gt;{name}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/html&gt; So we have basic page with a placeholder for some value which can be filled by retrieving _name_ from our DB. Now let's consider the Table: id | name 1 | z0ltan 2 | &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt; Nothing happens when retrieve db record 1, right? We will just show z0ltan on our page and everything will work as intended. However, when we retrieve db record 2 we have a problem. Whenever that page is loaded we execute a script which shows an alert with the content of our cookie. Just alerting the content of a cookie is not such a big deal, but a malicious actor could also steal the cookie and hijack the client session. This is an example of Cross-site scripting and we want to prevent it from happening because it poses a security risk to us and our clients. The snippet of Python code shown above is trying to prevent script from entering our system. For sake of argument, let's assume that remove_chars_between_string is a basic Regex (it's actually not, but it will make our example more readable and you can play around with it at on [this website](https://pythex.org/)): &lt;script&gt;.+&lt;\/script&gt; Just a basic regular expression, right? Now let's feed it this string with some malicious content: """INSERT INTO our_table (name) VALUES ("z0ltan &lt;script&gt; alert('yolo') &lt;/script&gt; _x");""" By now you should understand that we are trying to strip **&lt;script&gt; alert('yolo') &lt;/script&gt;** from the query. The regular expression will actually successfully match the malicious content in this instance. When can substitute it with anything we like. However, **the regex is case sensitive and the browser does not care about tag casing.** A villain could just rewrite their input: """&lt;SCRIPT&gt; alert('yolo') &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;""" Yielding: """INSERT INTO our_table (name) VALUES ("z0ltan &lt;SCRIPT&gt; alert('yolo') &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; _x");""" Now our regex fails to match the malicious content and script has entered our system. The Regex is completely broken and useless, because any attacker with a basic understanding of xss will try several techniques to bypass the intrusion prevention system. **Why is it in the wrong place?** It makes zero sense to try input sanitisation deep down in the call stack. As a general rule, you want to fail as early as possible. By the time the user input is about to enter the database we have already called several functions or methods. Moreover, we are trying to sanitise user input, not a query. The place is wrong, the naming is wrong and the function is broken. Whenever you encounter this, you may safely assume that the codebase was written either by very bad or very junior programmers. All bets are off. You can't trust the anything they wrote at this point. 
pipenv is a nice tool as well. It is built on top of pip-tools. However after trying both I prefer pip-tools because it is more lightweight and also faster. Additionally with pipenv I repeatedly got errors with dependencies on different platforms due to differing checksums.
That's not how it works. Basically, \`a\[-1\]\` gets set to the current point of iteration. You could rewrite it to the following: &amp;#x200B; for i in a: a\[-1\] = a\[i\] print(a\[-1\])
I disagree, R has much more support for statistics, bayesian statistics and econometrics. Though this is a niche, there are libraries such as forecast who don't have equivalents in Python.
There are absolutely loops in R.
the list is getting updated because `for a[-1] in a:` has an assignment hidden inside its implementation. Take a look at the stackoverflow post that I linked above. Anyhow, although python lets you get away with this, I cannot think of a use case where this could be of any practical use. Even if you could think of one, this would result in a very obscure logic and would be against the Zen of Python. You should always be very careful not to modify the iterator you are traversing over. &amp;#x200B; Question: How did you found this behaviour? Was it just a bug or were you trying to accomplish something?
I understand the original but not yours. I think that I need to learn more about functions 
I cannot replicate your code because I'm missing the `Tree` class definition.
The script works fine in jupyter. Not in power bi where it gives me an error of not being able to do math on strings. Lmk if you face the same thing
Is it true the pip freeze will not highlight all dependencies? i dont know where i heard it but im sure i have or i wouldnt be worried about updating requirments in that way
I completely disagree, for statistical analysis you are shooting yourself in the foot using python over R.
Scikit probably supports those, but you may have to build a bit more on your own.
First off, this should be posted in /r/learnpython, not here. Regardless, from my quick glance, in the function 'depth' you're trying to modify the global variable max_height which isn't a global variable. Try putting max_height = 1' before your print(max_depth(t)) statement and removing it from the max_depth function.
If you work with static reporting, knitr is an absolute godsend. https://yihui.name/knitr/ Also ggplot2 is unmatched in python for static graphing. I don’t think there’s an equivalent of kable or get for python either. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/creating-display-tables.html
It really doesn't, because ML aims at optimizing the response, y-hat, while often stats &amp; econometrics people will try to have unbiased estimates for the coefficients, aka b-hat. One is dedicated to have maximal predictive power while the other focuses on causality for example. They can, and sometimes do, work hand in hand but it's not the exact same thing. Also, the literature, libraries and many statistical packages are better in R. It's also easier to create plots and tables for academia in R. As I said, it's a niche but for some applications you'll have a headache in Python and for some other applications you shouldn't use R at all because it's slow. 
If all of the xml files are the same structure I would recommend looking at using xpath. It might take a bit of effort to get it set up, but once your xpaths are laid out it should run pretty smooth. 
Yeah but there is nothing stopping people from developing such packages in Python.
Guido said it’s probably going to be 3.9 -&gt; 4
Or most other languages for that matter, I just wish we had something that good in Python.
Shitty syntax!
I think they meant is as "don't use for loops"
That's TeX. Every version adds a digit as it gets nearer to perfection. 
I’m going to be honest: I’d never use R. There’s no need. When I’ve done statistics over large datasets or a data lakes, I’m doing it in SQL, or over large time series indexed data with in search syntax language support for these kinds of things, then outputting those numbers to python and creating any other number of variables with their own modifications. Python is insanely fast for, and great at statistics even before introducing pandas, numpy, or any of the other many statistical tools and frameworks that are available. Visualization and presentation, IMO, should be saved for a web page and professional JavaScript. Python should be a glue language to move and modify data in best case. I’ll be honest too, I think there’s nothing I’ve seen to justify R’s existence yet. And I’m tired of seeing R in smaller pools. I’ve seen some stubborn R users who lack knowledge of python and that’s about it: a programming language is no different than a yet another programming language. The same stuff you guys do could be done in nodejs, C, rust, or java beyond my bias for python and we could all benefit from conformity. As soon as I read through the article about the differences I laughed and stopped reading, scrolled down and read what was trying to be produced and laughed because I have four books under my desk from oreilly on “python data visualization”, “statistical computing in python” and a few other very similar titles that float around my house. This is a limitation of the authors knowledge. 
Forecast is not niche! I dont know why no one has ported it to python yet. Forecasting libraries in python is so rudimentary atm.
You would've loved html5lib then. For a while, they were doing asymptotic versioning and I think it got up to 0.99999999999. There were GitHub issues like "for the love of God use a regular versioning scheme"
Sadly agreed
Thanks for these. You've helped me to automate a few things using just requests instead requests + beautiful soup or selenium
I can tell you have never done any serious forecasting work in python. These forecasting libraries are too basic compared to R.
Thank you for your help! Right now, my frontend uploads an image to Firebase and when it gets uploaded, I want to trigger the python script to run. The script will then produce a result (just two numbers) which I then need to send back to the front end. I could store the result in JSON format back to my firebase bucket and then have my front end poll the bucket to see if the result has been stored. Would this be the easiest way? I know I could use Django/flask to send the data over HTTP but what would be easiest?
Currently, the backend just processes an image stored on Firebase and then prints a static result. I need to figure out the mechanism of front end/backend communication before I go ahead and implement it. I was thinking my backend could just process the image and then store the result back on Firebase in JSON format? As for triggering the script to run, this could be done when a new file gets uploaded to my firebase bucket right?
Just use Julia!
A couple years I believe. It hasn't supposed to be anywhere near as drastic as 2-3 though. 
No need the reinvent the wheel. Look into a framework like flask or django. These will handle hosting the script on an http server and providing endpoints to which a frontend could upload and image and respond with JSON. Flask is probably a better option since you likely don't need the database, ORM and templating that comes built into django.
I'm aiming to release a first alpha version of Strawberry, a library for creating GraphQL APIs https://strawberry.rocks/
Right okay, so if I used a service like Amazon EC2 to host my script, I could use flask to create a web app that my frontend could just point to (an online URL as opposed to a port on localhost)?
Congratulations! &amp;#x200B; Can you tell me what program you would use to actually run this program? Im a noob if thats not already obvious :D
R beats the pants off of python for static tabular reporting. 
Yup!

Another quick thank you post. Nice and clear &amp; concise.
What exactly can ggplot do that you can't with matplotlib? Maybe it's easier to do it with ggplot but I'm sure it can also be accomplished with matplotlib
not a big fan of knitr. jupyter notebooks work pretty well here. (btw also in R because of yours truly)
Start with a library like the built in XML etree: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html It will help you traverse an XML file through python-esque syntax. Then use this to write the loops and code you need to extract your data. 
You can't source control jupyter notebooks. 
&gt;Maybe it's easier to do it with ggplot but I'm sure it can also be accomplished with matplotlib https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/964515238702755841?lang=en It's not so much that it can do something you can't do in matplotlib, it's just that ggplot is designed for rapid iteration and simplicity. 
well, I prefer python almost everywhere, but the tidyverse does have its advantages. building a pipeline to wrangle your data is much nicer than pandas millions of methods with inconsistent parameter naming
You're welcome. Using selenium for fetching data is generally my last resort. :)
https://m.imgur.com/r/firstworldanarchists/snLplqq
Interesting. Wasn't aware of that, thanks.
tidyverse all the way. too bad the standard environment is so full of functions nobody needs and `library` just adds more. A python-like approach is \*much\* better.

Im confused here, are you referring to sum being shown? If so, that is just to show OP what the builtin sum does because the original has its own variable named sum.

That could be what they meant, but there are plenty of situations in R programming that need loops instead of apply functions.
Presentation == JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, or hard client
Unless some database is already in place i always go with Postgres. Reasons: - Good documentation - Big and good community - Good django support (or psycopg2 for simple scripts) - Extensions for almost everything Reason one might want to consider postgres but i personally haven't tried yet: - Allows for NoSQL (support for at least json/document and graph) should you want it or need it - Horizontal scaling via Citus
Plotnine is available for those unaware.
That is totally fair, sorry about that! and thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
This doesn't even work, as a note for others. Sum takes at most two arguments. And you're trying to multiply strings there.
Thanks for putting that together Netgu. I think we'll dig into this further and maybe write about it on our site in the near future. We run a lot of Python daemon processes on embedded Linux systems. We try to strike the right balance between simplicity and function. If we do post an article about this, we'll give you a plug.
:( 
And it doesn't even do that correctly.
They aren't plain text. rmarkdown/rnotebooks are plaintext docs. The git extension for juypterlab is a step forward, but is ridiculously hack-y
Your first video helped me a lot. I was using selenium to get some information from a site that had some javascripts on them. Turns out I can use there hidden api and get the information from a GET request! It's way faster and doesn't use a webdriver.
Gotta be honest... Tried using R. Thought python was better.
Whats a good library in R for this? 
Thats the way to go! This video is a bit more advanced where API is kinda "protected". You can check out this video as well to understand the complete process. :)
You're correct, purrr allows for more functional programming and is faster in most cases afaik but for loops I always useful. It's probably a common place because coming from other languages, one might try to use for loops on dataframes for example when vectorization is the way to go. ofc in some cases you just have to go through by way of for loops.
That's a horrifying workflow. Glad that it works for you though. 
I have access to LinkedIn learn via my institution and was watching a data science course that goes through the workflow in R, python and some other tools. The instructor is clearly more fluent in R than python to the point where he does a transformation on the data in numpy and then says "this is as far as you can get in python. If you want to visualise this I would recommend R". I was a bit dumbfounded. The same visualisations can be done he did in R can be done in seaborn, matplotlib or even pandas built in data vis
No I just would rather make an app that presents that data in a professional manner. IE a web page that streams in the last 60m of data over a web socket with a UI to allow the user to select more data, or use kibana or Splunk or tablu, to create an interface using their own presentation layers. Or use Swift or kotlin to build a front end phone app.
JSON is text, and why do you think it's hacky?
A tiny Python tkinter program with a single button works fine in Python 3.5 on MacOS, but is initially unresponsive on Python 3.6 and 3.7. The details as described in the link - I submitted this to stack overflow and almost instantly got downvoted to -1. Sigh. If anyone has had experience writing tkinter applications on MacOS, or has any information about this bug in general, do let me know - it's a blocker for me.

thanks after asking the question I googled and found: &gt; [classmethod() is considered un-Pythonic so in newer Python versions, you can use the @classmethod decorator for classmethod definition.](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/classmethod)
I initially started watching and thought yeah yeah, whatever. A few minutes in, i was amazed, very well produced video, good description. Thankyou!! Absolutely beautiful sir!
Typically, I update it once every 6 months or so. I look at a dependency and find the versions that are no more than a year old. Those are the versions I’ll support. I run one set of tests with the oldest set of dependencies and a set with the latest greatest. Usually, I end up supporting far more than I want to (packages don’t change all that much), but they’re not officially supported. Your package doesn’t exist in a vacuum, so being able to make it work on a range of dependencies and python versions is helpful.
What is 24-2? I thought we were talking about one of the 6 figures in figure 1. If your issue is you need make a point on an xy plane at some angle, just use some trig and calculate the point.
Thanks for appreciating the content, means a lot. :)
Mainly my question is how to plot the points with the angle, yeah
You’re in the minority. 7.5 years and not one donation through PayPal on a 150k lined project that gets about 1000 downloads per release.
I always work with python but I use Shiny if I have to make dashboards. 
Just use simple trig X= r*cos(theta_deg *pi/180) Y = r*sin(theta _deg*pi/180) Then just do a loop to input the angles.

Actually, it doesn't send any files over the Internet. The script simply calculates the sha1 hash of your file and searches the VTScan database with that hash for any malware signs!
Ah, thank you!
As an aerospace engineer, this is your best bet. It supports Cart3d, which is an Euler code. It can also solve a case in 45 minutes or so. Kinda depends on your flight regime, but most aero people are looking into high subsonic to supersonic flow. They’re not the greatest meshes out of OpenVsp in that you won’t have nice lofts, but they’re perfectly fine for preliminary design. Rob is also super helpful.

Yeah, one of the websites I scrape from doesn't populate its fields immediately (I don't know if that's the correct terminology) so requests returns content that has empty classes. But they call a hidden API which has that info in.
I would assume most libraries are not compatible, but could support it without a ton of effort. Still, given that Jython still doesn’t support python 3, you’re already in legacy mode, so you’d probably have to do it yourself. Every few years, I try to make PyPy work. I fix a few things, No dice so far.
Thank you so much for your help. I'm reading the nltk book and doing some exercises using sentdex's youtube channel. I'll try to do my best when classifying tweets and certainly will point out on document that this is a limitation of my project. Thank you so much!

Ah, my feeling is that this isn't a beginner's issue, but I might be wrong...
Oh that's interesting. I stopped using Jupyter because the outputs are included in the same file as the code. How does the git filter remove them?
That is correct but it hasn't happened yet, so R is still useful. Shame it's an ugly language.
&gt;No I just would rather make an app That's an interesting philosophy shared by almost no one.
Using both doesn't reduce the operational burden of R. Google "R in production" and you'll see a long list of headaches it's caused anyone who has ever tried to take a data scientist's pipeline and apply it at scale. Or at least I really want to assume that's the only reason anyone would actually use it at scale. &gt; For instance, R users sometimes yearn for the object-oriented capacities that are native to Python and similarly, some Python users long for the wide range of the statistical distributions that are available within R. Statistical distributions are just math that any programming language can do. There's no reason other than the momentum that R has in the form of it's many packages to use it. I know this is a actually a really compelling reason though, which is why I know as much as I do about the horrors of using R in production. However I think everyone needs to stop pretending like R is a real programming language and that anyone who suggests otherwise it's just a python fanboy. I'm not even a python fanboy, I just use it for work because it's the right language for the domain. R is never the right language for a production system unless there's no other way to do what you want to because some scientist only knew R decided to write their package in it Yeah okay, if you're just doing some exploratory analysis that will never make it into a production system then maybe R does make it easier so you should use it. However a lot of data scientists in industry are working on data analyses that hopefully will be included in a product of some kind. The more locked into R you are the harder it is once you need to actually work with software engineers. Software engineering is tough and there has been a lot of advances and best practices developed in the last several decades to make it easier, more reliable, and more secure. These don't seem to have made it into R. People who make comparisons like this between R and Python either are hoping no one ever wants to use their analysis at a very large scale or don't value software engineering efforts which is unfortunate because software engineers are expensive for a reason. 
100% this. Despite trying to do everything with Python there are instances where I end up having to use rpy2 to call R methods that are: 1) not present in python, 2) don't support the parameters the R version does, 3) does not work as good as the R version.
Hello. print(f'keywords: {kwargs} as {type(kwargs)}') Please, from where come this f'text' format style ? Is it Python 3.7 ? I use Python 3.5 and 2.7 but this syntax does not work. I have to use the classic Python3 syntax: print('keywords: {} as {}'.format(kwargs, type(kwargs) )
I figured the multiprocess stuff out thanks to you guys...works as advertised...piping and queueing are also really easy. What does the daemon flag do...does it really spawn a thread that the OS sees as a separate thread or are you still one big python thread with a sort of virtualised threading?
Wow. I just finished watching part 1. Can't wait to use this to solve my next task. Keep up the good work. I applaud the clarity of your videos.
These are called “f-strings” and we’re introduced in Python 3.6. https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/
[f-strings](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Formatted-String-Literals-or-f-strings) is a feature that is available in Python 3.6+ . You did very well adapting!
I'm thankful for pep8 and static anlysis
Not much. R's development is stewarded by statisticians. If you do parametric statistical modeling and vector mathematics, R is great. You can do these same things in Python with pandas, numpy, stan, and scikit, but it's a little easier to work with than Python, because the language is so stripped down. You can also teach R to someone that doesn't know how to code in a day or two (like a statistician, no offense), and they can hack out their own analyses with a minimum time investment on your end as a developer. As this article alludes to, you can then take their code or products and wrap it with Python. 
nope, it just tells python that this thread will never terminate - thus a join on it won't block etc.
no..ipynb is a JSON blob. You can't open it up and edit it like text without running the risk of breaking everything. You also have to ensure that you strip it of outputs. rmarkdown/rnotebook doesn't have those issues because they are just txt files that you can edit using anything you want. 
&gt; No I just would rather make an app that presents that data in a professional manner. Which is horrifying. I operate in an environment where high turnover is required so we don't have the luxury of having lag time/maintenance time for that kind of solution. Additionally, 99% of leadership just want static reports anyway.
Thanks for the appreciation. :)
Thanks! :)
Ok cool. Thanks for the answer. Do you maybe have any ideas on how to plot them as an intensity heatmap as well?[https://www.glaucoma.org/treatment/what-is-a-visual-field-test.php](https://www.glaucoma.org/treatment/what-is-a-visual-field-test.php)
I've been reworking my [ModDB.com](https://ModDB.com) scrapper. It was one of my first "big" projects and the beginning of a love hate relations ship with web scrapping. The first iteration could only parse pages that were related to games and mods cause that's what I wanted but after a while it got boring so I upped my game a little and decided that it should be able to scrape the entire site. After months of grind observing the website and parsing it I can say the scrappers covers about 90% of the website (probably 10% that I still haven't discovered). If you slap that bad boy with something like django or flask, you could technically make your own version of the website. &amp;#x200B; This project taught me Inheritance, Group Mixin, Meta Programming and I also learned more specific things like documenting code and creating automated tests. It was an incredible learning experience which helps me everyday with other scripts. I'm very proud of it but I know it's not perfect so I'm always looking to improve and expand on it. Anyways, I love this project and I hope you'll find it interesting: * Repo: [https://github.com/ClementJ18/moddb](https://github.com/ClementJ18/moddb) * Docs: [https://moddb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://moddb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) * Website the scrapper is built for: [https://www.moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com) &amp;#x200B; For those that want a good giggle, here's the commit [link](https://github.com/ClementJ18/moddb/tree/113b7d3063672b044f514b447cdce3357cb77201/moddb_reader) to the final version of my first iteration (warning NSFW code).
&gt; Google "R in production" and you'll see a long list of headaches it's caused anyone who has ever tried to take a data scientist's pipeline and apply it at scale. This is largely a myth and you're just about ignoring the beauty of something like reticulate which allows you take the best of both worlds (python + r) to integrate your workflow properly. The vast majority of data science workflows today are over-engineered convoluted nonsense trying to emulate the likes of Netflix/Google/AirBnB etc. 
Personally I prefer the libraries in R for any regression analysis beyond OLS. Fixed effects models in R for instance are much simpler / less lines of code than in Python. 
Way too many videos. Why are they so short?
The min length is 5 min. 
So useful, thanks!
Largely a myth? Man I'm taking from personal experience trying to run pipelines that sometimes have to include R on a cluster that has 20 TB of RAM. At large scales of data (petabytes or more) you can't just pipe shit around. Being able to call python from R literally wouldn't help me in the least. My problem isn't interoperability, it's the fact that R doesn't support modern software engineering best practices. It's not even easy to write an install script that doesn't break over time because of package version incompatibilities. You have no idea what you're talking about and believe or not, when people write "overcomplicated" systems like that it's often because they need to be. It's just really easy to handwave away all the challenges of software engineering when you're focused more on code than you are on systems 
0/30 is 3:00.
That's the intro to the course.
&gt; Python is an easy-to-write-hard-to-read language You obviously have never coded Perl. &gt; The lack of a type system is great and allows for enormous flexibility, but it also makes it hard to keep track of what I'm doing. No, it's because you are not a developer. You are a scripter. Scripters are not developers. &gt; I mainly work with C++ and Java, and one of the nice things of these languages is that they have systems that stop me from doing stupid things. Yes, until they get in your way and you have to hack your way around their system. I reckon that at least 50% of the gang of four patterns are trivial or irrelevant in python. They exist as a workaround for the type system. &gt; This is my problem with Python. I have code that often takes a while to run, and when I make a mistake, I might only catch it after my code has been running for a good 20-30mins. making the debugging process a very unpleasant experience. Because you are not writing tests. Write tests. &gt; I was wondering if anyone has any tips that allow me to write correct code, from the first time and also write readable code, that allows me to easily figure out what's going on. Write tests. Use traits or traitlets to enforce runtime type checking at settings.
What does equivalent Python code look like? library(tidyverse) df &lt;- read_csv("mydata.csv") %&gt;% filter(rt &lt; 500) %&gt;% mutate(score_diff = score 2 - score 1) %&gt;% group_by(subject) %&gt;% summarise(mean_diff = mean(score_diff)) ggplot(df, aes(x = subject, y = score_diff, fill = subject)) + geom_col() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(`Jack` = "blue", `Jill` = "yellow))
Did you just ignore my statement about reticulate? Lmao. 
None of those issues are unique to python r or java or c#. Looks like you’re using the wrong tools. Maybe refresh your systems engineering course for some best practices.

&gt; I am new in the community and new with Python You're in a for a bit of an education ahead of you in order to get into the world of Python GUIs. You may want to look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) if what you need is a single application that has a bunch of checkboxes or a window that has buttons that will open other windows with checkboxes. Here's a little sample program that runs online showing you checkboxes using PySimpleGUI: [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Checkboxes](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Checkboxes) If you want to run this locally on your computer, copy the code to your IDE and change the import statement from PySimpleGUIWeb to PySimpleGUI. This will run the code using tkinter, creating a window that looks like this: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54040578-bee22380-4193-11e9-9a4d-e8a823933bc3.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54040578-bee22380-4193-11e9-9a4d-e8a823933bc3.png) By comparison, here is what it looks like when you run the web version posted above: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54040680-f94bc080-4193-11e9-80b4-3c371aff0486.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54040680-f94bc080-4193-11e9-80b4-3c371aff0486.png)
Okay, let's accept your argument. I don't know why it is there, but it is there. If regex is un-Pythonic, then maybe the developers of the language didn't know of a better way. For me, it's a quick and easy way to do conditional text search and replace right in the code editor.

I think it could be thought of that way. like using the map or apply method in pandas. 
I said I'd come back and explain my criticism, so here it is. Sorry for the delay. &amp;#x200B; Your comment strings together a bunch of individual statements that are--at best, meaningless individually. But the way that you've related them to each other makes it seem like you really don't understand any of the concepts you're talking about and are just parroting things you have no actual experience with. And the result is that everything is at least a little bit wrong. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Forcing classes into a design can just end up with a ton of unnecessary structural code with logic and operations scattered across a dozen different places. &amp;#x200B; This is a totally meaningless statement. It's a thick wrapper around saying, "Bad design is bad." &amp;#x200B; &gt; OOP has a time and place, but it's definitely not a hard requirement for every design. &amp;#x200B; This is also a meaningless statement. Well, maybe not totally meaningless. What it means to me is, "I have no idea what the fuck OOP is." &amp;#x200B; But when you combine it with the first statement, you've related the idea of forcing classes to a discussion of OOP. This has gone from being meaningless to actively wrong. Using classes is only tangentially related to OOP design. Using screws instead of nails to fasten two pieces of wood together has nothing to do with what you are building, nor does it really say anything about how whatever you're making is designed or its architecture. &amp;#x200B; Using a class or even many classes in your program--whether using them well or poorly--does not make the program OO. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Specifically, I've found OOP to be overkill in a lot of microservice designs. &amp;#x200B; Here, we get a double whammy of buzzwords you don't understand. Is this a joke? But we do at least get a clearer definition of what you mean by OOP. Now it's very clear that when you write "OOP" what you mean is, "I don't understand other people's code, and I blame classes because I don't understand how those work either. And I'm calling all of that OOP." &amp;#x200B; You're using microservice in a sense that implies that it's somehow less complex than whatever you think the opposite of that is. Like a microservice is, by design, something that is simple and doesn't need all that "OOP" (see above for your current operating definition) overhead. The classic intro-to-SOA-architecture examples is pulling your authentication subsystem out of your main app and turning it into a microservice. Nothing about this microservice dictates an OOP design or other architecture. But I'll say this: if you write an authn microservice, and you *don't* interact with a User object to manage its state and instead only on functions to interact directly with the database, you deserve to be fired on the spot. Note, again, that using a User class does not imply an OO design. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Unless you plan to serialize objects across the wire (and include class defs in multiple places), it tends to be easier to just rely on functional designs; skip the class layer and just directly interact with your data stores. &amp;#x200B; Oh boy. I guess I'll start at the beginning because there's a mountain of wat here. Serialization has nothing to do with objects. Nothing. I don't even know how you got the idea these two things are related. Also, using objects has nothing to do with where you define them or if they are defined in multiple places. Even if serializing data did have something to do with your object structure, it's still totally unrelated to how you organize your code. So you've now confused OOP with two completely unrelated things: 1. whether you use objects at all, 2. how people organize their code. &amp;#x200B; Similar to how using a class in your code doesn't make your program OOP, only using functions and "skipping the class layer . . . " does *not* make your design functional. Classes and OOP design have nothing to do with how you interact with your data store. Functional programming has nothing to do with anything you've said up to this point, and also, functional programming has nothing to do with how you do or do not directly interact with your data stores. &amp;#x200B; &gt; I've had similar issues when using NoSQL backends too. &amp;#x200B; Similar issues to what? What issues are you talking about, other than you have no idea what any of the words you're using actually mean? I'll go out on a limb and suggest that *does,* in fact, cause issues for you when you use NoSQL systems. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Since NoSQL is about designing your data store structure around access patterns, it feels super hacky to shim classes (a relational design) on top. &amp;#x200B; What the actual fuck is this?! I'm starting to wonder if this is actually satire. NoSQL is *not at all* about designing your data around access patterns. You design your caching layers around access patterns. Not your data store. NoSQL systems literally sprang into existence because developers wanted to map **objects** to **data!** &amp;#x200B; Classes are the antithesis of relational design. Object abstractions are extremely difficult to correctly map onto relational abstractions. They are two completely different ways of thinking about state and data. Nothing about relational design has anything to do with OOP, classes, or objects. Saying that classes are a relational design is the most wrong thing you've said so far, and that's damn impressive. &amp;#x200B; Here is a translation of your comment where I replace all of your meaningless, improperly used buzzwords with equally meaningful bullshit words. It's buzzword madlibs. No meaning has been lost in this translation. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Can swing the other direction as well. Forcing hamburgers into a design can just end up with a ton of unnecessary socks with yoga and beer scattered across a dozen different places. Purple grass has a time and place, but it's definitely not a hard requirement for every design. &gt; &gt;Specifically, I've found purple grass to be overkill in a lot of dolphin designs. Unless you plan to saute big macs across the table (and include shoes in the attic), it tends to be easier to just rely on coffee designs; skip the hamburger layer and just directly interact with your car. I've had similar issues when using leafy backends too. Since leaves are about designing your car structure around elevators, it feels super hacky to shim hamburgers (a solar design) on top. &amp;#x200B; Sorry to come down hard on you here, but you're acting butthurt about no one explaining why you got the downvotes with a level of confidence in the quality of your post that's weirdly misplaced. I hope you do some research on the words an concepts you're throwing around and do actually learn some of them at some point instead of blindly parroting things you heard somewhere and offering them as a serious reply to a discussion about design.
Im a noob as well and learned something from your code! I did not know you could use a comma in string concatenation. I always did: print('string' + str(variable)) But doing it like you is sooo much easier. print('string', variable) Thanks for that! :D 
Pretty much the same, I think. Pandas can do the upper part just fine, (filter, add a column based on other columns values, group by). I'm not sure what summarise does. The second part can be done with matplotlib. In fact, the code looks almost the same with Pandas.
And they're amazing.
I simply started using Python for clients I already had. Yes, both, and more.
Praise God for making this easier. Python is so popular, but it still lags behind the C-language syntax.
I quit my job as a mechanical/biomedical engineer, took a few months off, and spread the word that I was looking. A friend offered me the job when I said I'd been learning about DS/ML in my spare time. The job is more akin to data engineering - building infrastructure and tools in Python and on AWS for data analysis in the financial services industry. I don't analyze the data myself but I do enable others to do it. Also, my salary was more than doubled in my career change. 
Was an Emergency Nurse, went to a coding boot camp with a python stack, applied to a job, got said job.
Thanks dude this was the most useful thing I've read today

They really are. So flexible, much clearer than % or format()
sapply and lapply offer no performance improvements over for loops.
Please read our sidebar
Literally butchered the whole website. As a web developer what should I do to stop this?
Have you tried pypy or nuitka to compile your code? They might have interesting optimizations for your code.
Parallelize it (and use pillow instead of PIL). Pillow already releases the global interpreter lock (GIL) during its computations as far as I know, so you can already benefit from multiple threads and don'd need to start multiple processes. `multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool` is your friend.
There are 2 ways of looking at this: 1. The website was providing the complete lecture notes' images on their webpage without any authentication. So some or other way, the data can be scraped. The best you can do imo is to associate a timestamp with the csrf token which gets updated whenever a call is made with given csrf token. If someone is overusing your api, you can put a kind of minimum time limit between 2 consecutive calls from same client in this way. 2. You can put authentication over your api and then check whether the user who is making request has enough credits or not and only then send correct response
Make sense. ✌️
It sounds like many of your problems can be solved with some well placed assertions and type hinting. Validate key assumptions you are making, and raise an exception if you can't immediately handle it. If you're working with a project big enough that you're having trouble managing the complexity, you should probably also write some comprehensive tests. Shoot for good coverage, by calling every function with both valid and invalid inputs. The unittest module is great for this. Hope that helps. 
Pyinstaller
Of course they do. sapply and lapply are vectorized, whereas for loops are not.
May daily routine is \- \`pip list --outdated\` \- \`pip install -U ...\` \- check if all the tests pass \- \`pip freeze\` and update requirements in project \- git commit and push to production branch too \- ansible-playbook --tags=updateprojectcode If tests are failing I either wait for dependency update or in rare cases I create a github issue on failing package page.:)
And additional, they are the fastest way to manipulate strings with Python 3.6+
To help you with lambdas I would suggest to play around with JavaScript/TypeScript and to use promises and observables. The value you will receive will only live within the scope of the callback and forces you to use it there. Generally a lambda is a shortcut for a full-fledged function.
You can give a try at Nuitka.
Like this? https://matplotlib.org/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_annotated_heatmap.html
Look into virtual environments maybe?
Any specific recommendations? 
I use pyenv to install multiple python versions.
No need to make it easy, it's easy already! Just stick them in every function definition and pass whatever you like, wherever you like without worrying about the consequences.
i use this when my arguments are dynamic
`virtualenv` is the tool to use in Python 2.
That doesn't work if the version of Python they want to use isn't installed.
If you can run Docker containers it would make it very easy to do so.
Would there be any problems with the current python version installed?
I can install 2.7. Would it interfere with the 3.7 already installed?
How do I know if I can run Docker containers?
Have you tried [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)? I haven't used it myself but I've got coworkers saying good things about it.
Ask the system administrators if you can run containers on the infrastructure.
It depends on how you install it, and how your system is setup. What OS are the workstations using?
If you're developing for 2.7, and you use 3.7, there most certainly could be some problems.
Seconded on nearly the same. In fact since you chose common ggplot components, the port of ggplot in Python can actually do that exact thing to a pandas dataframe basically verbatim.
 if Difference == 0: w = 0 h = 0 if ImageSize[0] &gt; ImageSize[1]: w = Difference/2 h = 0 if ImageSize[0] &lt; ImageSize[1]: h = Difference/2 w = 0 #i still consider myself as a beginner but #i believe you can turn this to an if else #block and move the first if block to the #last if else block as the other choice #has a more chance of turning to true #(thereby short circuiting the code).
Well idealy I would like to develop for 2.7 and use 2.7 without interfering with others developing for 3.7 and using 3.7. I want to figure out how I can do that correctly and efficiently.

If you're on a Unix-like OS (OSX, Linux, etc), then pyenv solves this problem neatly.
Okay yes thank you. I am working in Ubuntu. I will look into pyenv. 
You could check out multiprocessing also.
Hi I'm a grad student with to much time on his hands that has become extremely efficient using pandas and seaborn/matplotlib instead of ggplot. If you have any specific things about ggplot that you have experience struggling with in matplotlib, i'd love an excuse to dump time into new docs/tutorials/functions to make the equivalent workflow in Python more obvious/easy.
How so?
Technically Delphi, which is modern Pascal, so yes. 
yeap thanks!

There is already a port of ggplot for Python. It's not at feature parity but if you're only scripting there you go. There's also seaborn if you want simplicity. Ironically as a Python user, I feel that the main thing standing in the way of Python often is that it's ecosystem doesn't follow the "Zen of Python": there should be one, obvious way to perform a task.

The actual work is done by PIL and implemented in C. PyPy won't really help here.
are the actually faster for concatenation etc.?
I have a couple Chromecast Audios that will only work if I changed my wireless router channel first. It's a pain to login manually to do this so I'm trying to use selenium library and chromedriver plugin to automate it. My first pyhon program.. only problem I have is that my router page can not be inspected by Chromecast to pick out the field ID's. Still toying with it I've made progress, got the page to load and keyboard input. Been fun

Great video! Just one question. What’s the tutorial tab your running it all in? I really like the look and usefulness of it. 
Me too! Where are you learning it? 
Yess! In loving it so far. Im coming from an introduction course on MatLab. I'm trying to learn python by writing a code that will generate a safe password base on a word and a security level chosen by the user. I have the full working code in matlab now im just trying to port it to python!! What about you:)?
I usually use random module allowing to attach swagger definition to each route/method. Marshalling can be done using marshmallow. Sometime I generate marshmallow models from swagger object definition (swagger-marshmallow-codegen). apispec with flask could work too. Better decide which framework you'll be using first....
Strict typing can be easily replaced with asserts....
I absolutely loved ggplot in R and have recently moved to Python. Yesterday, I was trying to customise some plots using seaborne and found it to be confusing. I spent quite sometime in figuring out how to custom order the X axis , X tick text size, image size and so on. My problem is that some things are done easily using plt settings, even while creating plots in sns. This switching adds another level of complexity. In R, ggplot gives one stop solution for all things visualization. 
With standard `pillow`: &gt; Done! It took 67.94 seconds to process 401 photographs. Quitting... With `pillow-simd`: &gt; Done! It took 33.54 seconds to process 401 photographs. Quitting... `fd` with `graphicsmagick` takes **13s**, but it runs 8 parallel jobs: time fd -d1 -s '\.(jpg|tiff|png)$' -x gm convert -size 190x190 {} -resize '190x190^' -gravity center -crop '190x190+0+0' +profile "*" ../thumbnail/{} &gt; 10.10s user 2.01s system 93% cpu 13.013 total On the `pillow-simd` page it says `pillow` is always faster than `ImageMagick`, so I guess `pillow-simd+multiproccessing` is going to be faster than `fd+graphicsmagick`. 
Reminds me of the rest operator from JavaScript! 
I think you are talking about *Jupyter Notebook*.
Did you swap pillow-simd for PIL in my script? Because that’s a nice speed boost without starting to incorporate any multi processing!
That’s exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
I didn't have to modify the script, just uninstall pillow and install pillow-simd.
The framework I would be using is also going to be dependent upon what Swagger/OpenAPI solutions will work with it on the server side. What I care about a lot is how well supported and maintained the package is and then strength and breadth of its user base. &amp;#x200B; I am not sure what you are referring to when you say: &amp;#x200B; &gt;I usually use random module allowing to attach swagger definition to each route/method. &amp;#x200B; Thank you for pointing me to Marshmallow. Seems like a well supported and maintained project with a very strong user base. &amp;#x200B; What frameworks, in your opinion, are worth considering? Note, I am only interested in the server side here and handling Swagger/OpenAPI. &amp;#x200B; The two big ones I can think of would be Flask and Django, where Flask is probably better suited for small/medium size projects and Django is quite suitable for very large projects.
I'm working on a Space Invaders clon with turtle. I "finished" it, but now I'm just making some documents about its purpose and the like for college. I wanted to do an UML of it but since the code doesn't have classes or methods I wasn't able to do it. Still, it's just about writing some papers.
You can use [future-fstrings](https://github.com/asottile/future-fstrings) and use this formatting in older versions of python. Works great!

Not sure what other best practices you think are missing from R, but installing specific versions of packages is trivial.
Serving swagger is just a route serving static file of Swagger UI plus building proper JSON/Yaml designing your API. *Any* framework can do this, you can basically do it yourself without any integration. I don't agree with your definition. Django includes back-office admin interface, requires a relational database (actually can work with nosql, check djongo ;)). It provides strong integration from ORM model to marshlling but imo is not that flexible and more designed to build a complete website. I definitely don't use Django for APIs but do for user management for example (ldap auth + complete jwt auth server without barely writing any code). For pure API work, flask is way more suitable and you can use modules like flask-swagger-ui-2 to better integrate Swagger doc generation within your code. However there's no marshalling integration so you still have to do this yourself. As a huge async fan, I usually go with aiohttp, my own fork of aiohttp-swagger, model that need marshalling are externalized in a YAML file so I can run swagger-marshmallow-codegen to generate marshalling models. Welcome in Python world mate, it's basically up to you to choose what you want to work this, there's no "good" answer.
"no for loops"is now very old advice. Lots of times a for loop will be the best (and fastest) option in modern R.
What is the use of dynamic arguments? There is the principle that flat is better than nested data structures, but I feel like it makes sense to nest elements of a collection into a collection in most cases rather than use dynamic args
Yep
I've been programming in Python for 5 years and never really understood those. I never used them myself, just encountered them in other code sometimes. They're a lot simpler than I realized! Thanks!
Go write it for in python for us.
That's a great post! Thanks! Now i've learned how to use kwargs, and f-strings. I'm almost excited to go back to work on Monday.
Neato I actually think f strings are more readable
The real article should be 'basically never use \`\*args\` or \`\*kwargs\` because the method signature should make it obvious was arguments are accepted. 
Alright.. I'll give it a read.
[https://github.com/Cornices](https://github.com/Cornices) \+ [https://github.com/Cornices/cornice.ext.swagger](https://github.com/Cornices/cornice.ext.swagger) 
You may also check flask-restplus sadly it's not using marshmallow but a co-worker is working on fixing this (not ready yet)
Thanks! That really did demystify the whole args &amp; kwargs for me. I have been learning python for just close to a year and I have always shied away from them because i couldn't grasp exactly what was going on... 
Why did you select this over other solutions?
While there may not be a "good" answer, there are certainly bad ones...with a bad one being selecting a package that may work today, but was abandoned years ago or even will be abandoned soon. I would like to try to avoid the bad answers, while recognizing there may be one or more answers that would serve me well...part of the reason why I mentioned Springfox - being a good java based answer. &amp;#x200B;
Is that a different planet ? People are throwing solutions without asking which OS you are running :s If running any Linux distribution, you already have Python 2.7 installed
The classic example of this is something like a `sum()` function. You can pass it as many arguments as you want: sum(2, 3) # returns 5 sum(1, 2, 3, 4) # returns 10 etc. So what's the pythonic way of handling a stupid thing like this? sum('cat') Or for keywords, same kind of thing. When I write a function with keywords, I usually know what I want: def add_user(first_name, last_name): ....code here.... I could rewrite this as def add_user(*args, **kwargs): But how am I supposed to handle calls like this? add_user(address="123 Main St") My function doesn't know how to handle addresses yet, so how do I ensure correct operation here?
Are you using djongo ?
Yeah, I have to say that basically every time I've saved development time by using kwargs, it's just cost me time in maintenance. With args there are more valid use cases where it feels like a real net win. I've dealt with a large codebase where kwargs were used liberally at first. Refactoring that out of a bunch of places made the codebase much more predictable and thus reliable.
&gt; Second, the words args and kwargs are conventions. This means they are not imposed by the interpreter, but considered good practice among the Python community: I'm not sure how true this is. If you want the arguments to be completely opaque that's fine, but if you're implementing something like (for example) translating keyword arguments into HTTP headers, its better for the function signature to read `def make_request(url, **headers):` rather than `def make_request(url, **kwargs):`
converting a CSV file from a datalogger with a format like: timestamp1,var1,val timestamp1,var2,val timestamp2,var1,val into CSV with the format timestamp,val1,val2,val3,val4,valx timestamp2,val1,val2,val3,val4,valx for any number of data points. Each time stamp may or may not have all values. Adjust the dumb timestamp from the datalogger YYYMMDDhhmmss into something excel will recognize as a date. Uses defaultdict twice instead of the full blow CSV file because it won't know what all the columns are until it is finished, and the data has to be clean of ","'s in the values. The file from the datalogger is 11.5GB in size and has around 322 million lines in it (about 91 vars every second for ~40 days). I ended up filtering the main file into days using grep, and parsing the individual days because i was running out of the 16GB of ram i have.
I have been using Python ever since its inception (I'm not the youngest man). From the beginning everything was clear. Today there is a "new Python" every year. Yes it is fine. This is how it should be. But this all was supposed to be 40 years ago :-D. Not now. Unfortunately, it is sadly late and total chaos has developed in Python versions! Praise God for making something new, which finally improves the syntax of Python. It's just good. But it's too late. Unfortunately. Python is now messy in versions.
&gt; This is a totally meaningless statement. It's a thick wrapper around saying, "Bad design is bad." Meaningless? No, but your translation is accurate. There are times when wrapping something up as a class is a bad design, and that's my point. &gt; This is also a meaningless statement. Well, maybe not totally meaningless. What it means to me is, "I have no idea what the fuck OOP is." Again, no. It just means that people who are strict adherents to the "make everything a class" ideology will end up with kludgy, dispersed code. I've seen apps written with a 100 lines of class definitions spread across five .py files that could of been done with 50 lines of imperative code centralized in a single file. (And yes, I did use functional incorrectly -- I meant imperative). &gt; You're using microservice in a sense that implies that it's somehow less complex than whatever you think the opposite of that is. I cite that architecture because many microservices don't use monorepos, so if you want multiple services to leverage the same class, it becomes a huge pita to maintain several iterations of the definition across multiple repositories. I never said nor implied microservices were less complex (though I'd argue they are in certain respects due to strong decoupling). Additionally, monolithic apps use OOP as a way to organize, centralize, and embrace DRY. It also allows for communication across components. In a microservice arch, communication between components happens via REST calls, not by objects directly invoking each other. &gt; But I'll say this: if you write an authn microservice, and you don't interact with a User object to manage its state and instead only on functions to interact directly with the database, you deserve to be fired on the spot. A perfectly acceptable design pattern within AWS is to use Cognito as your user store and configure API Gateway to verify JWTs sent on requests. Authn can then be done by a simple value-check against the claims within a JWT (e.g. is the `custom:userRole` value within a list of approved roles). There's absolutely no reason to parse that JWT and return a User object just to make a `.is_authorized()` call. &gt; Classes and OOP design have nothing to do with how you interact with your data store. Uh, until you, ya know, use an ORM to expose your data store. Like how every RDBMS-backed app written since 2007 functions. &gt; NoSQL is not at all about designing your data around access patterns. Uh, yes it is. That's literally the entire point of NoSQL as a technology. You use it to optimize data store calls by skipping the denormalization step that occurs when using traditional RDBS -- the data returned can be operated on directly without needing multiple calls with complex and CPU-intensive joins. This is achieved by building your schema directly around how you plan to access data. Need to look up sets of data by a particular ID? Make that your index. Requirements changed and you now have to look things up by a different ID? Pray you've got room for another index or you're SOL and relegated to either scanning or redesigning your schema. &gt; NoSQL systems literally sprang into existence because developers wanted to map objects to data! Objects? No. It sprang into existence so that developers could store their data as it's being accessed and avoid all the unnecessary data manipulation to transform relational designs into whatever data set a user needs. I'd highly recommend you go and watch this re:Invent presentation on DynamoDB, as you seem to have some misconceptions as to the purpose NoSQL actually serves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k

Oops, I meant quick SORT instead of quick SEARCH in my title
that's what happens when you work in a dynamically typed language. i don't like it, just getting used to it from recently switching jobs that landed me in Python
not sure why you got downvoted, i find these to be extremely PITA the larger the codebase. it makes introspection and refactoring in IDE's much more difficult.
The f in fstrings stands for *fuck yes thats the formatting I want*
And faster than both.
From my understanding, .format() and f'' is the same same but different? As in it achieves the same thing, they just have different syntax. To me f-strings look more pythonic because of how pretty it makes the code appear. I've only ever seen braces used in the same manner as f-strings in ReactJS. Do other languages use it in the same manner?

Repl.it has some good courses and sololearn is good also 
Really? Never thought to run it through perf testing.
Definitely use pyenv, then.
But... Why ? :D
This makes sense to me. Using http headers as an example is also a great way to help understand why you might want to use kwargs.
They are actually pretty useful for wrappers.. they keep your code DRY.
Depending on the colormap you want, yeah. It's just an interpolation onto an RGB table. &amp;#x200B; Here is where the development of the new colormaps was done (e.g., viridis, infermo, etc.).

I'm using pygrib, a package that reads meteorological model data, to assess the level of weather hazards along a route in Google Maps; much like the current traffic functionality. Link to the project is [https://routewx.com/](https://routewx.com/)
you're fine as long as your data is small quick_sort(list(range(2000))) &amp;#x200B;
Holy shit, thank you! This is the perfect writing style and structure for this stuff. 
i think you have the left and right misnamed. the pivot swapping is unnecessary, just do it once at the end. you seem to also have a weird hybrid of in place and not in place sorting that has the worst of both cases in the fact that this is not actually in place but it has the complexity of an in place sort. there is also no point in sorting the pivot again, you should be returning sort(left of pivot) + pivot + sort(right of pivot) because we know for certain pivot is already in the correct position. the check for len == 2 is unnecessary because you already have the base case of len &lt;= 1 programmed, just use it, you're saving an insignificant amount of time and increasing the complexity of the code
DRY isn't always the right move. I highly recommend you watch Sandi Metz's [talk on this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) A little duplication is better than the wrong abstraction. Reasons like what you mentioned (things like \*args and \*\*kwargs being good for wrappers) leads to IDEs that can't autocomplete, confusing code, and methods that *look* like they do one thing, but actually do many things. &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` def process\_payment(amount, tax, user\_payment\_method, \*\*kwargs): total = amount + tax if kwargs.get("processor") and kwargs\['processor'\] == "adyen": adyen.process\_payment(total, user\_payment\_method) else: braintree.process\_payment(total, user\_payment\_method) \`\`\` is a confusing method for many reasons. In this case there should be three separate methods to handle this. 
&gt; So what's the pythonic way of handling a stupid thing like this? &gt; &gt; sum('cat') Raise an error. It's not a problem with `*args` though. It's a problem with dynamically typed languages, every argument a function expects can be of another, incompatible type. &gt;My function doesn't know how to handle addresses yet, so how do I ensure correct operation here? Well, you just said it doesn't know how to handle it, so it would just ignore it. It would (hopefully) check if `first_name` and `last_name` are set in `**kwargs` and as they aren't, abort with an error just like a call like `add_user()` would.
I didn't either ;) [realpython.com](https://realpython.com) did it [here](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#speed)!
For fun and to learn new tools and libraries in the process.
"string".format() (\*args) to name a quick example. Also, passing arguments through to lower functions (\*\*kwargs) as well as passing named data to things like dict() and anything that can consume content, like Jinja2 filters
You're right, using it this way is confusing and I hope no one does ;) Sometimes it's just a little more readable/convenient. Also, definitely going to watch that talk when I find the time! 
If you don't have time for the whole talk right now I'd recommend you read her blog post summary on the topic. It'll only take you a few minutes. [Link is here](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)
Personally, I don't like using * and ** in function. * can have its usage, but especially the ** can just be better replaced with clear explicit keyword arguments. However, I think passing argument with * and ** is much more powerfull to know. Take a look: A = [1, 2, 3] print(*A, sep=";") print_config = {'sep': ",", 'end': "\n\n"} print(*A, **print_config) Also here is some semi-related advanced usage of a star in function definitions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/
Get a copy of r inferno. And loops are bad in R. Like really really bad and inefficient. Avoid them except for lapply, sapply and vapply. Avoid apply which is just masking loops in r code. Learn to vectorise. This is probably r's greatest party trick because its blazingly fast at handling vectors. So if you can think in vectors instead of conditional and loop statements, r is fab. Learn to rmarkdown (for easy publishing), tidyverse (which is a great umbrella package for data frames, visualising through the great ggplot2 and its various extensions, etc), datatable, plotly (which greatly enhances but slows down your visualisations), and if you're modelling, most importantly learn to caret. If you're very adventurous you can also look up parallel processing in R. 
No. Pymongo. 
Django with MongoDB with pymongo ? What ?!?
I almost scroll over when I saw *args **kwargs being scared as you mentioned in the first line of the text. lol
Automating some stuff at work that utilizes Excel spreadsheets and checks my Outlook for specific kinds of messages and acts accordingly. I learned recently that you can read and write to *opened* Excel workbooks and that is pretty neat, in my opinion. So I wrote a script that, when run, checks my recent Outlook messages, and if a certain kind is found, it opens up a specific form and auto-populates it for me, as well as creates a new folder and a different Excel file inside of it. Before, I had to create these folders and files manually, which is somewhat cumbersome. Now it all happens automatically. 
As the bot has said before, these kinds of questions belong in /r/learnpython 
If print wasn't defined with it you'd have to call `print(['Hello'])`.
If you write any kind of decorator you'll need to write a wrapper for functions whose arguments you don't know. That is the most common use-case. Variadic functions (what you're calling dynamic arguments) are extremely common in other languages when doing string manipulation where each argument is an extension to the transform. Since it's harder to make tuples in other languages it helps Python better fit in by the "principle of least surprise" when switching between languages. The flexibility variadic functions add can help in making a simpler, more appealing API for your program where constructing an object before passing it to your function may be less obvious than doing it behind the scenes with the arguments.
How? 
I recommend Anaconda or Miniconda (same thing as Anaconda just doesn't come with all of the scientific computing packages preinstalled). You can have as many virtual environments in Anaconda as you like and each environment not only includes the specific version of python, it also includes just the packages you've pip installed within that environment. 
I do like that the standard library includes nice basic functions like seq and rep though. 
No worries, thanks for the advice! I’ll post there too!

You should check out reticulate It requires a pretty big workflow change from rpy2, but it's 100% worth it IMO. https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/
Dogmatic DRY leads to strongly coupled code that's hard to understand.
This is really cool. Very creative!
Ahhh cool good to know. It's more convinient in this instance to just call the API but i have a few projects in mind where this could be useful. cheers
Hi. Have a look on https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ . You needed not just a parsing but serialization as I understand.
&gt; Raise an error. Presumably my function will be something like this: def sum(*args): x = 0 for i in args: x = x + i return x so calling `sum('cat')` will already return an error: &gt;&gt;&gt; sum('cat') Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in sum TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' Is that it? Is that enough to be "pythonic"? 
Yes you are right i only ise serializers with rest API i have. Didnt thought i could have use otherwise
You beat me to it. Agreed 100%. 
That's a very good comment and more or less summarizes my main issue when starting to use seaborn. I use it for scripting together plots but at the end of the day as soon as I start customizing anything or making a custom plot I'm 100% rolling it by hand in matplotlib right off the bat, so that I don't have to make the cognitive jump between the two. &amp;#x200B; I don't think it's worth re-rolling matplotlib's functionality in seaborn personally (to make seaborn a stand-alone plotting solution), because matplotlib is that and already exists. Most people aren't (?shouldn't be?) trying to use seaborn as a ggplot replacement. I more treat it like a convenient source of helper functions for matplotlib than anything else, and I think that's how it should be treated, not as an independent library to "do your plotting" with. &amp;#x200B; In Python, matplotlib is the one stop solution for all things visualization, and other packages (like seaborn) are just there to augment it. Would you not be content with using plt's settings for everything? It's not a "grammar of graphics", but at the end of the day you're just specifying one piece of plot settings at a time, no matter what language you do it in. It probably took me just as long to figure out how to customize all those things in ggplot the first time I used it, but that's just the price of learning a new toolkit, not a statement about which is better.
When I find **kwargs in the documentation of a library function I usually scream FUCK for the extra minutes that it will take me finding out what arguments can that function really accept
``` 3. Use Pipenv... ``` Huh, not so subtle plug.
There’s always a trade off to including type hints or not. The thing is, if someone is using type hints, you aren’t optimizing for developer readability, you’re optimizing for correctness and lack of ambiguity. It also helps your tools much more than it hurts programmers, because it allows for method/attribute introspection and typechecking. 
The community consensus is generally that `f-strings are f{opinion}!`.
They are not noticeably faster than using `str#format`.
You should indent the function arguments an extra increment
Apply sorted to the dictionary, this normaly does the trick
that would indeed mitigate, and it's actually reported in similar cases (specifically, long if conditions) in pycharm and flake8 as incorrect indent level.
\*\*kwargs is extremely useful for higher order functions. For example I have a project with a very simple testing function that takes another function from the project as its argument. I have \*\*kwargs as the final argument because that way I can pass different settings to the function being tested without having to make the test more complicated.
as far as type hints go, I think they are an eyesore. When I see file_path: Optional[str] = None, All I can see is Optional[str] = None. The variable name and the value are now detached from each other visually. Human vision has high resolution in a 3 degrees cone. Type hints make glance understanding a microscopic but relevant burden. Although one may laugh at such considerations, when your job is to look at code for 8 hours, 5 days a week, these things have a weight. 
I respectfully disagree. Like many features in many languages, they are very very useful where their place is. True, most of the time one should not use them. But when you need some dynamic behavior, *args (in our case *records, to account for received data) allow to swallow many Items at once, and use the very same code for one - half the code, half the risk for bugs. Granted, I almost never use **kwargs, its more of a catch-all thing I use mostly for tracing external calls (remote procedure calls etc.). I think keyword only arguments with defaults are immensely preferable, where */** are not necessary.
I think that is just personal. For me these document the code quite well, thus making it more readable.
I strongly advise you to begin migrating your code to 3.7. Keep using a virtual env with py27 but unless your code is in the 100k lines of code, py27 is dead. it is no more. it ceases to exists. it's an ex version. Anybody using py27 today will eventually be left in the dirt. The time for delays is over. Migrate now. 
I wish pycharm hid them as metainfo. They are annoying. 
/r/learnpython 
I feel you. I am dead set against having a static typing in Python, unless I can get performance on par with C, and then I'd consider it. Or at least... that's where I was. And then I started using data classes and mypy and now I use type hinting all over for a few reasons: 1. type hinting makes maintenance easier for people who are not me when reading my code 2. with pycharm, it makes API's easier to use when they are type-hinted 3. installing mypy within pycharm (see: ) means that it catches problems. 4. I'm a bit more hesitant to actually do `Optional` now, and overall that makes me think a little harder about my APIs... and overall, I think that's a good thing. 5. I've caught real bugs because of type hinting while in my prototyping phase, and no doubt that meant I had less rework later 6. Refactoring is now much more straight-forward 7. Did I mention dataclasses? These are really amazing for both tests and for controlling APIs... Oh and I've completely replaced anything that looks like JSON (i.e. massive dict/list trees) with data classes -- all for the better. So my general statement here is try it for a while and be open.
Wouldn't that be better with a def fn(url, headers): Where headers expect a dict. With a good doc string (or even type hints) this would be a lot clearer what you're trying to do. After all, that's how requests does it. 
&gt;Note how it is very, very hard to see at a glance where the function definition ends and where the function body begins I can't help but feel you are just wrong here. There is a *very* obvious return to function declaration level of indent before the body. Never had to delve through much code using type-hinting but this was super simple to read for me. For anyone used to having types in function declaration for variable instantiation, there is nothing hard to read here. You just are used to zero typing information.
I’ve been there, and I can tell you there’s better ways to apologize for that than how you’re doing it now. It’s up to you as a technical implementor to guide that discussion.
Agreed. The only place I've felt that they are really useful are in matplotlib's plottong calls! There they allow you to customize a huge number of things. 
So when you make a dashboard or web page or service or microservice that produces that once a week you’re telling me you’d rather me just R- manually it out than let you self service the request or automate it..? Really? 
How do you discover what arguments a function will actually use?
Nope. We just have a very very clear firewall between the data engineers and the analysts/report engineers who build the reports for leadership. 
Definitely /r/learnpython is better but since we are here...I would recommend two things. One is that you probably want to “hoist” the match_id out of each play into a dictionary by match_id . Two, this is a good case for a defaultdict. So you could do: from collections import defaultdict as ddict matches = ddict(list) for play in plays: matches[play[‘match_id’]].append(play)

\*\*kwargs is a dictionary.
Readability is something you learn and get used to. Remember when you couldn't read code, or English, at all?
if that were true, we would all be coding in perl.
If you can't read a line with a type hint like `file_path: Optional[str] = None` then how do people read Java or C#? 
&gt; There is a very obvious return to function declaration level of indent before the body. No there isn't. the parenthesis and the arrow make the None: almost at the same level with the rest of the indentation of the body and of the arguments. It's barely visible, and definitely less visible than a traditional function definition style.
&gt; then how do people read Java or C#? Foo foo = new Foo(); They don't. They suffer the problems that python syntax was meant to solve. Besides, type before name is actually _more_ readable than type after name, so in this case, C++/Java/C# actually are _better_ than python in terms of readability. until of course you get in the situation of `Foo&lt;Bar&lt;Baz, Quux&gt;&gt; foo` 
Depends. You might consider it a "more pythonic" to allow something like `make_request('blah', user_agent='mything')`, but it's less obvious (more magic). HTTP probably isn't a good example as it has a whole host of other configuration beyond just headers.
What do you mean? The parenthesis are **literally at the same indent level as the function declaration**. Reading indentations depends on reading where the begin, and it is **definitely** at the same indent level as the function declaration. You just aren't used to a non-python or VB style language. This is quite literally considered standard looking code in **numerous** other languages. It doesn't ruin readability. It ruins readability for **you**. The rest of the comments seem to agree as well.
&gt; literally at the same indent level as the function declaration. That parenthesis is the only thing that breaks the flow. It's too little as a visual hint. All I see is from top to bottom a stream of lines of code indented one, and then "hey, there's a parenthesis there". This is _not_ good readability. &gt; You just aren't used to a non-python or VB style language. This is quite literally considered standard looking code in numerous other languages. All these languages are obviously paragons of readability... &gt; It doesn't ruin readability. It ruins readability for you. The rest of the comments seem to agree as well. I would not say they do. 
I use named positional args then add a **kwargs at the end so a dict can be passed if it is warranted. This way it's obvious what's expected but flexible cause sometimes passing a dict is sooo nice
do you know a lot of python or AWS?
I understand and accept that you don't like type hinting, and that for you, it makes code harder to read. I believe you'll get used to it if you stay with Python. Hinting isn't going to go away magically. Liking hinting is something else entirely: I do not like Python's data classes as they require hinting. I would say that java progammers being unable to read java is a bit of a wild claim.
There's lots of "Python for X Programmers" resources out there, a short Google away.
Nah I would use python
&gt;That parenthesis is the only thing that breaks the flow. It breaks the flow, that's my point. Do you need a billboard? &gt;All these languages are obviously paragons of readability... To people who only code in those languages. VB hurts my eyes, as it does many other developers. As for you interpretation of the comments, there are more in favor of than against. And only 1 is actually against without stating that **you need to get used to it** or that **it is just you**. 
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
&gt; It breaks the flow, that's my point. Do you need a billboard? IT IS NOT ENOUGH!
That makes complete sense. Many people online mentioned sns to be an enhancement of plt, without mentioning the caveats. In my case however, the need for customisation arose because the text in X axis was getting jumbled up etc. They were more of a requirement to make a presentable graph. I suppose this would be quite common and people end up using plt for most part. Once I knew what to look for, finding help was the easy part. I think some one new to Python from R would benefit greatly from knowing such pointers, if there are others. 
I have to disagree. I've used python like twice in the past year, and for nothing more complicated than a keybinding script. I didn't even know this syntax existed. I can read that entire program easily. Without syntax highlighting. On a phone. In my head I think "variable name of type is value". Not hard at all.
&gt; I understand and accept that you don't like type hinting, and that for you, it makes code harder to read. The conversation is not about type hinting, which is a different topic. It is about how the code is formatted in response to the use of type hinting.
I've been reading python code for the past 15 years 8 hours a day 5 days a week and often also during weekends, I think I have a different opinion.

&gt;IT IS NOT ENOUGH! Apparently not for you it isn't. But it has been enough for the **vast majority of coding styles for all languages for all of history**. It adds a lot to the language with very little impact. Sorry you can't handle it. This is just your opinion and it's mainly against all of everything ever except for python/vb only coders.
you. are. wrong. PEP8: Indentation Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent [7]. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line. Yes: # Aligned with opening delimiter. foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four) # Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. def long_function_name( var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four): print(var_one) 
I'm working on some quant finance development. I'm building some algorithms that can process stock data and predict future prices based on some simple moving average crossover techniques and variance analysis.
Oh OK, if we're going to argue about formatting and how many spaces to put where, I don't care. This is like where the braces go in C. If you're participating in an existing project you shoudl match the project's style and every project wil do it differenty and you'll have to learn to "read" their style. If you start a new project, do whatever you want.
There's nothing to argue. PEP8 says it clearly. 
1) Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent Check! They are aligned vertically with a 4 space indentation. 2) When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line. Check! There are zero arguments on the first line and each continuation line is indented 4 spaces. 3) Aligned with opening delimeter What? This isn't a requirement without knowing what to align with. The line containing the closing delimiter and opening delimiter are on the same indent level here. 4) Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. Check! There are four spaces of indentation for the continuation lines containing arguments. Both my evaluation of this and my pycharm with strict PEP agree that this code is formatted as such. Calm down, it's okay to have an opinion that isn't the general case, get over it.
The case I am raising is literally the last point of the No entry. This is not under discussion. It's a violation of pep8, and the reason is that it's unreadable. The code I posted at opening is not adding an extra level of indentation to distinguish arguments from the rest. It's a PEP violation and it sucks. 
PEP8 also says 80 characters per line, and most people ignore that. Do you know how much of the Python standard library is PEP8 compliant? If you're working on an existing project, match their style or you'll screw it up, and never reformat code, or you'll break version control.
https://imgur.com/a/HH8Ojb7 What are you talking about. The arguments are indented. I'm staring at it.
duly noted! I assumed the sum function would total (or solve) the math using the defined variables? (assuming i'm using the terminology :D ) 
is it ok to cross post something like this there as well? 
Ding dong your opinion is wrong!
&gt; lambda functions (not gonna lie, had to look that one up) (In computer programming, an anonymous function (function literal, lambda abstraction, or lambda expression) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier. ... If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function.)
saved!
&gt; PEP8 also says 80 characters per line, and most people ignore that. and most people are wrong. Python is about visual consistency and readability. It has always been. &gt;&gt;&gt; import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. **Readability counts.** &gt; Do you know how much of the Python standard library is PEP8 compliant? &gt; &gt; If you're working on an existing project, match their style or you'll screw it up, and never reformat code without permission, or you'll break version control as it'll pick up the changes to whitespace. This has nothing to do with my desire to modify that code. What I am saying is that 1. that code is poorly readable 2. that code is not PEP8 compliant 3. the addition of type hinting on the function arguments has introduced the possibility for longer argument lines 4. longer argument lines induce more and more people to align the code in that manner, which is a PEP8 violation and a readability eyesore. 
They must be indented _TWICE_ to visually separate the arguments from the body, as specified by the PEP
Very good explanation! Thank you

It only says 4 extra spaces in the PEP, where does it say 8 or double indents? It doesn't. Also pycharm using PEP formatting puts it to a single level of indent. Either way, has nothing to do with the original point of the discussion. I'm sorry you are incapable of reading it. Don't use it. Don't use anything that does. Overall - it has a minimal impact to readability and again, most of the comments agree with this and so do most of the people who use it.
I seen that but wasn't sure how to implement it! noted :)
So.... the type hints aren't the source of your issues with the readability then?
i'm 56 with 25 years of IT behind me working in every arena except programming (I don't consider html programming although I guess is a perfect world it is) 
PEP8 doesn't define what is readable code. It is a standard used to provide a standardized format.
what point of _extra_ is not clear? &gt; Overall - it has a minimal impact to readability and again It does not. I am sorry, you are all wrong. It's IN THE PEP.
Doesn't mean you are right about the readability. It also doesn't change the fact that it is formatted with 4 characters via a PEP8 strict formatter. Ding dong your opinion is wrong! Blocked and ignored you whiny, pedantic fuck.
This is no longer a technical argument, but one of aesthetics and style. It's red vs blue. I like red, you like blue. We'll both be OK.
Digging through the documentation and looking for comments regarding it
not directly. I am saying that type hinting is a separate issue which is not under discussion here, but it's a factor that induces that kind of behavior because it makes function arguments longer and thus more likely to be split. If it were only isort, I would consider it a fluke, but I've seen in other packages and colleagues code as well. 
&gt; DRY isn't always the right move. I agree but I think this is picking on the wrong aspect of that comment. Wrappers is the point.

Good to know, Thanks! 
we are not both ok. it's a PEP violation and makes the code harder to read. Period. An additional indent of the arguments clearly differentiate the arguments from the body of the function. Which is the spirit and reason why this very rule exists in the PEP. 
Well here's what the standard library thinks about that: In [46]: from functools import reduce In [47]: import operator In [48]: reduce(operator.add, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) Out[48]: 15 In [49]: reduce(operator.add, (1, 2, 3, 4, 'five')) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-49-fdcfa9008915&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 reduce(operator.add, (1, 2, 3, 4, 'five')) TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
Preach on, bro. If you have a lot of energy I suggest making the appropriate pull requests to bring the standard library into compliance with PEP 8, and getting Google converted to 4 space indents as they use 2.
Don't worry, just let me know if you pass by my company I will make sure not to hire you.
My personal gripes: " = " instead of "=" for parameter defaults makes it hard to distinguish that block from normal code assignments. No blank line after the function declaration. Lengthy comprehensions crammed onto one line. Type hints in the comments for some random reason.
had to look that up :) so venv is a serverside virtual environment that uses its over specific version of python? https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories. I have multiple servers at my disposal and just used a cpanel server that was already setup with python3. In moving forward, i'll be using a vanilla centos7 box to code in. That being said, if im understanding you correctly, venv creates a virtual environment for the local script to run in apart from the existing version of python? 
Type hints aren't the problem, my dude.
Correct. I find it helpful when playing around with different versions of Python without having to change system Python version, or spin up additional servers.
Seriously. If I ever write out really dynamic functions that can take variable keywords or something, I always write out in the docstring exactly what you can do and what arguments to add.
I've used Heroku to do this.
If you’re writing python code then the file you should be saving is a .py file already. Just send that .py file as an attachment just like you would email a photo. Assuming that’s how you’re turning in work. .py files are just like any other file on your computer. 
I think i seen the sum function and used it to do the math (pulled that from learn python the hard way) but seen that it was using python2.x and was told "'thats old shit, use this fresh new shit! (not actually but close) lol
noted for future ref 
Oooo nice
?
I was literally running in a terminal after I ssh'd into one of my servers... I installed python 3.7 and created the .py file in vim, added the info, ran the script, googled the errors, reran it, googled the errors... until it worked #python3.7 calc.py is the actual command itself :) 
that was in the book as well... 
that deer in the headlights look...LOL
Excellent read. This was very clear and had lots of great examples. Thanks for sharing!
so would venv be backward compatible to python2.7 if I create a script... well, wait... im creating the script itself in vim but using venv, it could be run in any environment (defined by the venv module for the specific python version) on a server? eg. if I have python2.7 on one server, I could define the script to use that version specifically?
I started using learn python the hard way but it uses python 2.7. I'm thinking I may try doing the exercises/tasks in python3 (I know there are going to be differences between the 2 versions but, I may get a better understanding translating back and forth by attempting to use python3 instead)
dumb thing is I can pump out bash easily du -sk ./* | sort -nr | awk 'BEGIN{ pref[1]="K"; pref[2]="M"; pref[3]="G";} { total = total + $1; x = $1; y = 1; while( x &gt; 1024 ) { x = (x + 1023)/1024; y++; } printf("%g%s\t%s\n",int(x*10)/10,pref[y],$2); } END { y = 1; while( total &gt; 1024 ) { total = (total + 1023)/1024; y++; } printf("Total: %g%s\n",int(total*10)/10,pref[y]); }' (breaks down disk usage within a folder by Gb, Mb then Kb)
One of the reasons I switched to VSCode is because it handles mypy much better. PyCharm uses `typeshed` to highlight the errors but they have their own implementation of mypy-like tool which is rather basic. Then you have situations where PyCharm thinks your code is ok, no warnings, but running mypy reveals errors. Plugin is also pretty basic. VSCode just runs the mypy with parameters you set and highlights the code, simple as that and I love it.
100% agree. Function declarations like this are a cancer in Python right now. ``` def my_function( a, b, c, d ): ``` Please stop doing this.
so an f-string eliminates the need for the .format(sum=sum) portion?
python is not readable even without the types so what does it matter already
Cropping should use little cpu but a lot of memory, but likely it will take so much longer to transfer the image data that it would'nt overwhelm your server. 
Well this is useful af 
Hello, your explanation was really good. I don’t know much at all about programming just yet but I really liked how you broke each segment apart and explained the reasoning behind why it wouldn’t work. Not only does it help to spot errors better, but it helps understand the flow and security protocols. Thank you, it was helpful :)
This is genuinely the most helpful thing I’ve read this week. So a grand thanks to you from me! I came across a problem recently where I had to pass an unknown (but typically large) number of key-value pairs through a custom utils function used in multiple scenarios under different conditions. Unfortunately, I called the function as my_function(..., kwargs=[my_dictionary]) and then unpacked with def my_function(..., **kwargs). Inside my_function, this led to kwargs={“kwargs”: “kwargs”: [my_dictionary]}, which confirmed my fear of kwargs and a rage quit to pass a dictionary instead.
TL;DR : `*args` in the function definition : `args` is a list of required parameters for that function `**kwargs` in the definition : `kwargs` is a dictionnary of optional parameters to the function `*my_list` when calling any function : unpack the values of `my_list` as the required args for that function. `len(my_list)` must be equal to the number of arguments the function requires. `**my_dict` when calling a function : unpack `my_dict` into named arguments for that function. The names of the arguments must match the keys of `my_dict`
but I see I actually redefined the actual built in sum function by assigning it to the (cup * day * month / box) math. If I wanted to use sum later on as the actual sum function as its designed for, it would return the (cup * day * month / box) again as opposed to the actual function... nice
To add to the answers, using **kwargs can make it very easy to pass in a big number of arguments to a function, or to make the setup of a function saved into a config file. Say you want to customize the args of a tkinter button. The tkinter.Button class can take a foreground, a background, a font, an image etc. Instead of naming every argument, every time, if you want all your buttons to look the same, you can just store these values in a dictionnary, and then pass that to the tkinter.Button constructor. Very handy to make customizable themes.
also, I see now why devs use a whiteboard...lol I literally had to back away, think about what I was trying to accomplish, then break it down step by step and then, simplify the process in each step. I started out trying to use all kinda funky shit formulas in my head...LOL :D 
Replace the word app with any proper front end presentation or format, including cron job emailer or google drive sheet
For anyone thinking "You should never use \* and \*\*", you should not be deciding whether to use \* and \*\*. They are immensely powerful and while in theory all you need is \*\*kwargs, the usage of \* and \*\* should be spared for very specific and clear use cases. I'm sorry that many that seem to feel that because their codebase may contain or be depended on some unsavoury usage of these operators, that they should be outright banned. But if you think that a language should restrict the user to a pre approved set of static paradigms and patterns, you really shouldn't be using python in the first place. 
Mood.
Part of the problem is pep8 doesn’t allow extra spaces before ‘:’ and ‘=’ to help align the code. If you lined it up like: def __init__( self, file_path : Optional[str] = None, file_contents : Optional[str] = None, write_to_stdout : bool = False, check : bool = False, show_diff : bool = False, settings_path : Optional[str] = None, ask_to_apply : bool = False, run_path : str = '', check_skip : bool = True, **setting_overrides : Any ) -&gt; None: if not settings_path and file_path: settings_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(file_path)) settings_path = settings_path or os.getcwd() self.config = settings.prepare_config(settings_path, **setting_overrides) self.place_imports = {} # type: Dict[str, List[str]] self.import_placements = {} # type: Dict[str, str] self.remove_imports = [self._format_simplified(removal) for removal in self.config['remove_imports']] self.add_imports = [self._format_natural(addition) for addition in self.config['add_imports']] self._section_comments = ["# " + value for key, value in self.config.items() if key.startswith('import_heading') and value] it looks a lot better to me
&gt;Note how it is very, very hard to see at a glance where the function definition ends and where the function body begins, Because there is no doc string. Add a docstring to the function, and see if that problem doesn't go away.
Not sure exactly what you're asking, but sapply just calls lapply which uses a for loop ultimately. In a few cases, the extra overhead makes sapply slower then pumping values into pre-allocated vector. The costly thing with for loops of adding to and object list.append style. You should definitely avoid that in R.
Seriously, \*args and \*\*kwargs just make sense in very limited cases. There're not only very slow, but also prevents static checkers like mypy or pycharm.
Sapply and lapply are not vectorized.
the one I linked installs a checker that uses your native mypy.
One of the great things an engineer can do with Python is remotely control his/her scope. This article only scratches the surface. We use remote operation for compliance testing, protocol testing, functional test, etc. Python, PyVisa, and Visa are awesome!
You need to give way more details. Are you doing the training in stages? Did you turn the learning rate way down?
I second this. After learning about reticulate my whole workflow moved to R. Best of both worlds, though my work definitely requires more R than Python. 
I did a fair amount of python at work but wouldn't have called myself a professional coder. I was proficient though. And I had never done any AWS stuff beyond what I'd dabbled with after an online course. 
Honestly depends on the application. Web, desktop applications: R blows in many cases. Analytics (we do lots of stats and ML on stupid large datasets), programmatic munging, database interaction: R is beautiful at scale! From my experience, at least. I have totally seen R used in cases where you go “wtf just use Python!” 
Only if you don’t know about `&lt;&lt;-`...

No holds barred death match in a razor-wire cage. Last person breathing got the job.
&gt; my salary was more than doubled in my career change. Actually making the world a better place? We'll pay you shit. Enabling a middle-man class of parasites to leach vast amounts of money off everyone else? Awesome, bring a front-end loader to work to collect your pay. This is why we're doomed.
&gt; Note how it is very, very hard to see at a glance where the function definition ends and where the function body begins Easily fixed: use *two* (or more!) indents for continuation lines: def __init__( self, file_path: Optional[str] = None, file_contents: Optional[str] = None, ... ) -&gt; None: if not settings_path and file_path: settings_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(file_path)) settings_path = settings_path or os.getcwd() ... 
Hm. You use a question in your title, then express your opinion in a way that express other to do stuff the way you think stuff should be done. After that, you do not seem to have a slight change of changing that opinion, refusing other arguments. If you are not here to discuss, what the heck is the goal of that thread? If you are not willing to listen other opinion, do not ask. Submit the idea of the good practice "do not use type hinting" in the mailing. 
Lining up parameters like that is an anti-pattern favoured by people who love to spend large amounts of unproductive time pretending to be busy instead of actually working. I know, because that's a damn easy trap to fall into: "I spent 8 hours editing code today!" "What did you do?" "I renamed a variable." "And that took all day?" "Well, after I renamed it, that changed the amount of whitespace I needed in the parameter declaration, so I had to reformat that method. That meant it no longer matched the other methods in the class, so I had to reformat them. And then that class didn't match our template, so I had to update the template and to go through the code base and change the rest of our classes." "And that took all day?" "No of course not. I also changed my mind and changed the variable back again." 
&gt; I am dead set against having a static typing in Python, unless I can get performance on par with C, and then I'd consider it. That's the reason why I started using https://nim-lang.org/ - feels like (statically typed) Python, and has the speed of C.
That isn't really a fair thing for you to say without knowing my situation. I don't think for a second that my previous job was making the world a better place. Their lack of moral compass was at least part of the reason why I left. They were exploitative and greedy. The CEO drives a Ferrari, but their workshop technicians get paid the equivalent of $10K per year in our local currency, and got treated like absolute garbage. I was paid better than that, but still below market rates. My new job, however, is giving me the skills and capital that I need to start my own business, which will be in the medical space (ideally later this year). It will require a hybrid of hardware and software skills (especially cloud computing and big data), and I was only confident in one of those things before. As they always say in business, never pay your own "school fees". Whenever possible, try to learn new skills when someone else carries the risks associated with your mistakes.

This is awesome. I've been looking for a good way to automate the soft token retrieval for a while. Most of the solutions involve launching the app and faking keyboard input. It seems Mac only has the 4.X version, but to my untrained eye the implementations look the same. Unfortunately I'm running into some issues with the get_tokens function. I created an issue on your repo, I'd appreciate any assistance you're able to provide!
Amazing article. Keep it up 😀

Call me deaf but I can't hear much in that video. Sorry.
isort has some pretty ugly, sloppy code. i wouldn't use that as a measure to judge how type hints affect readability chopping down parameters is pretty common, and it has nothing to do with type hints. more often than not, too many arguments means you're violating the Single Responsibility Principle, so there are better ways to improve readability than omitting type hints also, readability is not just about reading the code that was written. more often it is about using the code and its documentation. type hints make it quicker to determine what values can be passed, and importantly, whether you are passing incompatible values if identifying the beginning of a function or method is really causing problems for you, put a blank line after the constructor signature, indent the parameters, or anything else. hell, i'd rather you put a comment `# IM AN IDIOT. THE FUNCTION STARTS HERE!!` than get rid of type hints i dont think type hints are critical everywhere. i mainly use them for signatures on publicly parts of an API
I can’t believe I only just now realised I could do f’{var}’ instead of .format - thanks 
I mean if it was possible Black would just do it automatically and you wouldn't have to do anything at all. That is a very weak strawman.
Or reading the docstring (assuming finding author wasted those 5 minutes of his or her valuable time).
&gt; That isn't really a fair thing for you to say without knowing my situation. Sorry mate, I wasn't having a go at *you* and I apologise if it came across that way. It was a wry and sarcastic comment on the way of the world: as a biomed technician, you at least were doing something that in principle helps others (medical equipment or technology), no matter how grasping and greedy you boss was. But the financial services industry is this enormous, bloated, billion-dollar-a-minute industry that, when you get right down to it, acts only as a middle-man between the people with money and the people who get things done. And they get very, very, very rich on it. So rich that the financial services industry can distort democratic systems, crash economies, put tens of millions of people out of work, manipulate markets, etc to protect their bonuses. This might not apply to the company you work for, but there is no doubt that [vampire squids](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-vampire-squid-strikes-again-the-mega-banks-most-devious-scam-yet-101182/) like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and, in general, the financial industry as a whole, has long ceased to play a useful role in society and is now just a vicious blood-sucking parasite.
I have several remarks here: 1) This code is not so bad, I can pretty easily read what it does 2) 99% of the time, when you have `Optional[str] = None` you really want `str = ""`. In this function definition both would work exactly the same, and in most cases an empty string is sooo much nicer than None. That would also make everything nicer in the function definition, because `Optional[str]` takes a lot of visual space. 3) The code would have the same length without type hints, the problem here is that there are too many arguments in the function, not the type hints themselves. In general I try to avoid classes with more than 5 init arguments. Most of the time such classes actually do several things at once that could be split up in different separate things. For instance here it seems like your class does both an import of something, the tracking of said import and reporting. I usually separate the concerns of such things in different classes, so the reporting class does only reporting, the import class does only import etc. Then one orchestration class or function takes care of putting everything together. It also makes things much easier to test as you don't have to initialize too many things and can test independently the components. The added bonus that concerns your question is that 95% of my classes can fit arguments on one line. I obviously make many exception to that rule, for instance when I write command line functions or for the orchestration function itself, but in general it helps quite a lot. It is much harder to do when you are writing a general purpose library though because in those cases it is frequent to have many many edge cases to handle and parameters. I couldn't imagine Requests having that philosophy for instance. But in those cases the typing is super important because the type hints are kind of like your documentation, so you want to have the argument one per line and add a comment for each anyways.
Ok I understand it a little bit better now, but is there an example of how this is used?
After adding typing to some more complex functions yesterday, context managers and decorators, yes, I must admit, the readability went down at least 10%. And I didn't end up catching any bug, because the testing procedures were good enough in the first place. &amp;#x200B; I ease my mind knowing that it will help in the future for people Ctrl+Q-ing in PyCharm to see the function declarations. My advice would be: if your code doesn't have to be extremely secure and there's a lot of re-usage of the functions, don't use typing.
Can you please also write the code-readable version, for comparison and initial understanding?
Or instead of threads use processes (If the program is CPU bound). Then each process gets its own interpreter. Going from 1 process to 2 Can have around 30-40% improvement for cpu bound scripts.
Yes, but you need to keep it open and run it manually.
&gt;Sorry mate, I wasn't having a go at you and I apologise if it came across that way. Sorry, yeah. Looking at your comment again I can see that you didn't mean it the way I interpreted it! My apologies too. Your point is well taken, and I agree. This is why I do see what I'm doing now as a temporary means to an end. The FinTech space can be horrible, you're right. My job is not great in that regard. It's not terrible, but it's not great.
 I need to bookmark this to come back and read. Thanks for sharing.
Vectorisation is definitely faster than base for loops unless something fundamentally changed in a recent version of R...
I think Linus tech tips did a video with a security camera project. Maybe some inspiration can be taken from their setup. https://youtu.be/H7p5YEOrlSc
thanks for publishing! very helpfull. &amp;#x200B;
Dict would nicer imho cause you would need to translate all those keyword arguments to the real header name. (requests for example just accepts a dict too).
How long was the boot camp? What would you say the biggest take away was from it? Because of it, how will you move forward (in python )? 
So this is neat, but...in reality wouldn't I just use `find`? It has more options and is always up to date.
Good talk! I particularly liked the bit explaining numpy views in terms of shapes and strides.

For me, a method with 10 parameters is already unreadable, regardless of type hints!
&gt; Pillow already releases the global interpreter lock (GIL) during its computations as far as I know, so you can benefit from multiple threads and won't need to start multiple processes. 
YourString.split(',')[0]
[PEP-484 and stub files](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files) (*.pyi files) : it allows you to write your types in separate files ([mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stubs.html) about stubs). I'm surprised nobody mentioned it.
without watching I'm guessing it's just gonna be "use numpy and understand how it interacts with stuff, and when in doubt use numba JIT or Cython"
That's two questions. Which do I usually use (2.6) and which do I prefer (no preference). I'm forced to use 2.6 at work.
I will make that two
Thanks. Is that literally all. Isn't there also something about displaying the relevant portion? Like "print" or something? 
If you know exactly what arguments you might add you would include them in the function signature. At most you can document some common cases.
Vectorization is. But sapply is not vectorized.
Exactly, e.g when calling matplotlib functions from a seaborn plot. 
What are you using the data for? That's kinda of important to know.
To directly print print(YourString.split(',')\[0\]) &amp;#x200B; or to assign it to a variable firstSplit = YourString.split(',')\[0\]
Something like this? &amp;#x200B; x = YourString.split(',')\[0\] print(x)
You could use [Open EdX](https://open.edx.org/get-started/get-started-self-managed/) 
Well, not at least distributed computing?
I already checked that but it looks pretty complicated to maintain and modify.
not sure I haven't watched it. It makes sense that there's not much optimization stuff, most people just use another language if they need speed. but its shocking how people misuse numpy. I have a colleague who was complaining about numpy speed and when I checked he was using a raw python loop when the numpy nditer could have been used or the loop avoided by simply using vectorized compute. it's really common. keeps our jobs safe I suppose.
Use print(YourString.split(',')[0]) for python 3 and print YourString.split(',')[0] for python 2
Nice schemes!
I mean you could create your own if you dont like the models that exist already
ok... sorry! &amp;#x200B;
yes, that’s a thing that python has too: `range`. For everything that’s not used in basically every package’s code, having it under a namespace would be better. There’s [ongoing design work here](https://github.com/klmr/modules/issues/129) to build something better for R, but that won’t help with the existing abundance of available symbols available from stats, utils, methods, graphics, … and yes, base is huge!
You know you can get paid for this right?
&gt;You can't open it up and edit it like text without running the risk of breaking everything. I can and sometimes I do (e.g. to quickly change a cell’s execution counter to have a nice 1 2 3 4 in there). It just needs to remain valid JSON and not violate the spec. &gt;You also have to ensure that you strip it of outputs. Executing `nbstripout --install` once per repo isn’t remotely tedious. It’s so short I don’t even need to look it up. &gt;rmarkdown/rnotebook doesn't have those issues because they are just txt files that you can edit using anything you want. And have their own problems. Their output is saved to some invisible directory next to the file and not into it, so you can’t just upload that one file. Also deleting the notebook it doesn’t get rid of that invisible trash. Notebooks have existed longer, so there’s a lot more tooling, and they’re cross-language instead of living in their own little ghetto. Sorry. The RStudio guys introducing the rnotebook made me irrationally angry. Why couldn’t they just integrate with a fine ecosystem that already exists for the *exact same purpose*? That just smell of arrogance or ignorance.
That's a really good idea. You should submit that as a feature request
Well, that’s what git filters do. It’s [a gitattributes thing](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_code_filter_code). You can install that specific git filter using `nbstripout --install` and then git applies the “clean” part of the filter whenever you `commit`, `diff`, and so on.
Paid for which part? Doing brief code reviews for random people on the Internet or writing tiny and trivial but useful Python modules?
You need a new job :p
Well not all people have background in Programming. Many time I have refactored code for Data Scientist, speed gain impressed him a lot. Well, it was millions rows dataframe.
Catia can interact with Python?!?
Yes
Apparently, to visualize
Oh I thought you meant it hands over control of the gil like numpy rather than gets rid of it. I must have misinterpreted what you wrote
By the time i needed \`swagger\` there was no other framework "public" that had it, so i added it to \`cornice\`. 
&gt; It just needs to remain valid JSON and not violate the spec. Which is a huge problem... It's fine if it's just one person, but things get messy quick in a collaborative environment. Which is why git is best used with txt files. &gt;Executing nbstripout --install once per repo isn’t remotely tedious. It’s so short I don’t even need to look it up. &gt;It leaves the outputs in my notebooks but out of my checked in code. How do you ensure that your outputs are synced with the code? in rnotebooks we get two outputs automatically which remain in sync after each save. &gt;And have their own problems. Their output is saved to some invisible directory next to the file and not into it, so you can’t just upload that one file. Also deleting the rnotebook file doesn’t get rid of that invisible (now) trash. It does not at all. Care to show me where these "invisible files" are? The only thing in our git repos are the notebooks and the rmd files. &gt;Jupyter notebooks have existed longer, so there’s a lot more tooling, and they’re cross-language instead of living in their own little ghetto. I mean that's fine, but rnotebooks already have captured better R + python interop than jupyter has while avoiding all of the issues....because they were smart enough to keep files as plaintext. &gt;Sorry. The RStudio guys introducing the rnotebook made me irrationally angry. Why couldn’t they just integrate with a fine ecosystem that already exists for the exact same purpose? That just smell of arrogance or ignorance. Because JSON blobs was a shortcut solution. The proper solution was figuring out a plaintext way to ensure interop. 
Also a function that accepts `object`
I frequently do web scraping gigs and require rotating proxies for that. I wrote a script to do proxy rotation for me. Here's a write-up on it: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.kashifaziz.me/proxy-server-rotation-python.html/](https://www.kashifaziz.me/proxy-server-rotation-python.html/)

No, my job is awesome. I just need IT to move a little faster. In fact, it isn't even at my location, but the place I have to ship to.
Not sure if you're aware, but "Codebase" is already a company in the UK (I think that you're UK based?), specifically a technology incubator. Given that you're also using "Codebase" for a technology business/service, I thought I'd mention it just in case they are able to force you to change name. I have no affiliation with Codebase (other than walking past it occasionally) and no legal training whatsoever, but I've had friends who have had to change their business names and it is an absolute pain so wanted to give a friendly FYI just in case. To reiterate, I have no legal training whatsoever so have no idea if they can do anything. Just a friendly FYI from one Pythonist to another.
So you stole video from pydata youtube channel, uploaded to yours, and now sharing loool.
That's what I find a little frustrating about Python, discovery leaves a lot to be desired.
This would amazing. I've been doing a lot of self taught stuff but I don't feel like I'm grasping the information by myself. I hope your idea comes to fruition.
moodle is a good choice. It already has most of what you need, plus the ability to add students to classes, add assignments and quizzes. 
It does, just like numpy. And just like with numpy, PIL(ow) and can utilize multiple CPUs from multiple threads, and does not require the overhead of multiple interpreters in separate processes. You only need multiprocessing if your task is CPU bound and (mostly) written in Python. For IO bound tasks, or tasks that spend most if their time in a function call implemented in C (which usually release the GIL), threads are fine.
This is exactly my point in the whole discussion. People apparently don't read past the title and interpret it as they want. 
I love you. Some custom implementation details. The ```_generate_next_value_``` override definition is kinda important to follow: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#supported-sunder-names Additionally. I fucking love this dude's syntax. the ```*_``` argument in the overridden function actually means something. It's like variable unpacking for a single star. But the dude doesn't give a fuck about the variables he's passing in. HENCE WHY HE ASSINGED THE FUNCTION VARIABLE TO UNDERSCORE. Aka: he doesn't give a fuck about what the arguments passed in are. Will you marry...sorry for Ted Mosbying you
I love you both
It does indeed, but it's a chore to keep aligned if you introduce something that is longer.
We already produced 60 hours of content with the first cohort. It was amazing seeing them progress from complete novices to where they got. We completed Learn Python 3 the Hard Way by Z. A. Shaw. This time around i'm actually letting the members make decisions, and ask questions. It's working really well, and really helping keep engagement very high. Join us Sunday 7pm London time! I think you'll like it.
Very true, but I've seen this done in three or four arguments functions as well. They like the idea of aligning them like that because of type hints, and it makes single line definitions more and more unlikely.
it's going to be a lot of trial and error and false positives like you've already realized. there's no restriction on how or where shops are implemented. You might consider looking at popular ecommerce platforms and plugins and look for unique artifacts that will identify them. for example, certain static assets that are loaded or specific urls. this will also lead to false positives in the form of honey pots though

Java and C# are less popular than python and a large part of that is not because they are *un*readable but for sure it's because they are *less* readable. The problem isn't as evident when you quote one line. Compare the length of two code bases that do the same thing though and you'll see what the issue it.
And, based on what you know now, you would make the same decision to use Cornice and Pyramid?
And have yet another thing that unexpectedly breaks and demands attention as soon as I start refactoring? Putting types in a separate file helps with the verbosity of the code but it does so at the expense of [code cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)). It might be worthwhile if type hinting catches a *lot* of bugs or offered some other great benefit but the benefit needs to be high to justify ruining code cohesion in project.
&gt; The thing is, if someone is using type hints, they aren’t optimizing for developer readability, they’re optimizing for correctness and lack of ambiguity. In theory that means it should be catching lots and lots of bugs. In practice I find that it's a little like linting code - 95% of its complaints aren't bugs (but they still demand your attention anyway) and of the 5% that *are* bugs, most are either shallow or of low importance. &gt;It also helps tools much more than it hurts programmers, because it allows for method/attribute introspection and typechecking. Tests + import IPython ; IPython.embed() does this too.
&gt;I think that is just personal. Python code bases are 30-50% shorter than equivalent Java code bases. Python is more popular for several reasons but the **primary** one is because the lack of syntactic and type cruft makes it easier to read and maintain. The last thing this is is personal.
Awesome!
&gt; Java and C# are less popular than python Are they? How are you measuring it? Java is #1 on tiobe right now and Java is above python on redmonk and github.
&gt;Which is a huge problem... &gt; &gt;It's fine if it's just one person, but things get messy quick in a collaborative environment. In practice it really isn’t. &gt;How do you ensure that your outputs are synced with the code? in rnotebooks we get two outputs automatically which remain in sync after each save. You don’t, you execute stuff again. If you merge in new changes, you need to execute the whole thing anyway because you don’t know what the changes will cause down the line. &gt;It does not at all. Care to show me where these "invisible files" are? The only thing in our git repos are the notebooks and the rmd files if they are multi use functions. The outputs aren’t in the text files. Why do you think they are there after closing RStudio and opening it again? Because they’re saved somewhere. &gt;I mean that's fine, but rnotebooks already have captured better R + python interop than jupyter has while avoiding all of the issues....because they were smart enough to keep files as plaintext. I don’t understand. How does interop have anything to do with the notebook storage format? Please elaborate.
Yes, it's not really a replacement for standard tools, more like a fun pet project to play around with.
For my University python class I am writing a program that takes a number and encrypts it so it can be transferred safely then decrypts when it gets to the receiver.
I get that you have a hang up with pycharm... and pycharm definitely doesn’t use community grown tooling and favors their own software. Pycharm is written in Java like all of their IntelliJ based IDEs, which makes actually running and connecting with python problematic...yeah it’s got its problems. But please refrain from commenting on something you obviously haven’t used or don’t know about. The plugin that I linked is built by the mypy team. It actually works as you would want it to and uses the mypy installed into the virtual environment that your project uses. It’s one of the better 3rd part Python centric tooling that I have seen. 
This seems interesting...having self taught the bare minimum myself in various languages and never finding a 'complete course' for free online I would gladly stop by and check this out 
``` ...But please refrain from commenting on something you obviously haven’t used or don’t know about. The plugin that I linked is built by the mypy team. ... ``` I did use the plugin and I know who wrote it. Also the fact that PyCharm is written in Java is no excuse, VSCode is written in typescript (electron) and it runs the command, parses the output and highlights the code in editor according to the results, how hard can it be? The point is, no need to be defensive about your tooling im just saying there are alternatives, people might be interested to try them.
I should have been more specific when I used to term 'popular'. I was thinking of the "most loved" list of languages in the stack overflow survey: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/ Python is #3, C# is 8, Java is #18. This isn't necessarily about "most used". I am strongly of the belief that languages that a lot of people both use and hate will inevitably go in to decline while languages that are over a certain usage threshold but people love will have a bright future.
I can't answer that because there is no one single version I "usually" use, and the versions I use are not always what I prefer.
Have you used typescript?
A simple and shitty way is just to grep the source for strings like "magento" or "woocommerce"
Right but we weren’t talking about now, the conversation was in the context of the future.
Typescript and Kotlin are anomalies on that list I think. Both were built expressly to deal with the **enormous** headaches involved in developing in two very poorly designed but still very highly used languages. Typescript isn't popular because it's typescript - or even because it's statically typed. It's popular because javascript's type system is an utter trainwreck and it's an effective band aid over its flaws. That doesn't mean that it's intrinsically good, but it does mean that it attracts a lot of goodwill.

This tells me you haven't actually used the plugin I linked: &gt; Yes, but you need to keep it open and run it manually. Unless you want to clarify what `it` is.
Ah! I had checked it on my PC and it sounds fine, but on my Ipad it *is* a little low. I was trying to drown out the noise from the cars in the background :(.
Thanks!

That makes complete sense. Many people online mentioned sns to be an enhancement of plt, without mentioning the caveats. In my case however, the need for customisation arose because the text in X axis was getting jumbled up etc. They were more of a requirement to make a presentable graph. I suppose this would be quite common and people end up using plt for most part. Once I knew what to look for, finding help was the easy part. I think some one new to Python from R would benefit greatly from knowing such pointers, if there are others. 
Well repond with what seems right to you. 
I have seen People do it 
This really isn't a technical issue, and is basically liking red vs liking blue. It could be argued that copying the annotation syntax of a very popular language like typescript makes it easier to learn annotations in Python for the same reason that so many languages base their syntax on C. If there is a technical issue here, it's that TypeScript is not statically typed. It's the same as annotated Python. They are dynamic languages that use optional comments to enable better tooling for IDEs.
Because they’re as bad as C++ header files with none of the benefits.
People need this! If you want you can contact sentdex and start an organization that gains popularity to python. I think many people neglect the pythonic power.
I read your entire post -- every word -- before answering, and I've re-read it three times since. I still don't see how your "entire point" was to tell people to use extra indentation for their function parameters when you don't mention even in passing that people should use extra indentation. I'm not a mind reader you know. The only advice you give is to tell people "please don't use it", with nothing at all about what they should use instead. So if I have misunderstood you, perhaps the problem doesn't lie with my reading comprehension, but *your* writing skills. 
Actually yeah, exactly. Video definitely didn't need to be an hour, or at least could've put those basic tips up front for people who are familiar with numba and now how important vectorizing numpy is.

Typescript does not implement static typing simply to allow the IDE to know what type something is. That wouldn't be worthwhile. It does it to enable stricter compile-time type checking which catches the kind of corner-case bugs which javascript's brain-dead type system encourages. The critical difference isn't really about static vs. dynamic. It's more to do with strict vs. weak/implicit. If you watch the video "wat" by gary bernhard you'll get an idea of why typescript was such a necessary band aid to javascript. The bugs caused by javascript's type system are incredibly painful - python programmers are fortunately not exposed to quite the same degree of pain.
I don't think there's any real difference. Type annotations in Python are extremely useful for larger projects, just as they are in JS, and not really necessary for smaller ones, just like in JS.
Yeah i've come across his channel already. Would love to have a chat. Codebase is pretty unique because you can do social-coding directly on social media sites. Any &amp; all help to grow would be appreciated.
Well designed large projects are assemblages of a lot of loosely coupled smaller projects. Badly designed large projects are typically aided more by the application of an effective integration test framework than they are munged on type annotations. I've been working on large scale python projects for the best part of a decade (some with type annotations; most without). Not once have I ever felt like it was a worthwhile investment and the people I've worked with who did ("because best practices(tm)") were typically unable to accommodate the idea in their brains that implementing new development practices required at least a minimal cost/benefit analysis.
A brain.
that's a vague description and a bit dubious sounding, but it seems like you need a class. either way, that should be asked in /r/learnpython, not here
Ah, sorry my bad. 
I think it's not your colleague's fault. Numpy exclusively supports vecterizations for builtin functions from numpy libraries. NOT a chance to vectorize python fumctions if you don't use numba or cython. P.S: np.vectorize is a fake one, implememted in pure python via python for loop.
&gt; A brain. Did a web search for 'python "a brain"' because I expected there's a code generation library called like that, but I didn't find one, so I suspect this to be a joke. Let me explain why you sometimes don't want to write code yourself but instead have a code generator. Assume you need to build a tool to transform data from format A (i.e. XML) to format B (i.e. a set of Django ORM model instances in memory). Now your data in format A adheres to a certain specification (i.e. XSD). First you look at the specification and write Django model classes for the entities. Then you add code that parses an XML file, validates it against the XSD and then reads the data from the xml entities and fills them in the Django model instances. That might be a lot of code you have to write because there might be hundreds of entities and some entities have like hundreds of fields, some are optional, most of them have types (float, date, string, relations between entities). Now you wrote the code but you made some mistakes when writing that code (everyone makes mistakes, especially when having to write a lot of monotone boilerplate code). It's quite hard to test because the test data you have has not a lot of coverage because the XSD is quite huge. But over time you find the severe bugs and get rid of them. All is nice ... but now someone changes the XSD. Damn, at least the changes are backwards compatible, so you only have to add more boilerplate stuff. This works fine for years but you live with the uncertainty of still having bugs in that code. After doing this often you think to yourself: "Why do I have to write all that boilerplate code? That's a job that can be done by a machine. Also a machine doesn't introduce bugs as long a the code generation step is correct." And that's the point when you want to leverage code generation. Testing the code generation step for correctness is easier than generating all potential XML files that could adhere to a certain schema definition (if the schema is huge). In the end you use the knowledge you gathered writing manual boilerplate code to generate a tool that writes boilerplate code for you.
Add a keyword argument `zero`, default to be 0. def sum(*args, zero=0): acc = zero for each in args: acc += each return acc Thus we could avoid mamy malformed input and make them valid and meaningful. In terms of your case, `sum('cat', zero="")` is okay.
Do any of these large projects have engineering blogs that I can read? It's very easy right now to find large python users like instagram and dropbox writhing about how they find annotations beneficial, but I haven't seen one to the contrary (yet).
I'd probably use metaclasses if I had the kind of problem where code generation could actually help. The last time I saw a project using code generation where I thought that it *ought* have to used metaclasses was a tool to generate python code from swagger descriptions. Django's ORM is a good example where metaclasses were used to good effect (there are very few of those). In general I'm **extremely** suspicious of anybody who claims to have the kind of problem that requires either metaclasses or code generation would help though. In 90% of cases I've seen the person attempting to use it *vastly* overgeneralized the problem that they actually had in an attempt to prepare for some future problem that will in all likelihood never arise. Moreover the code that comes out of a process like this will be hellishly complex and difficult to understand and debug - whether metaclasses or code generation are used. I'm about 80% convinced that what you have here is an [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). Beware.
I understand that, but in this instance there was no real need to use a loop. I don't remember the exact thing but there was a NumPy function to do this with that was far faster.
Sorry if I'm being pedantic or condescending here, but it would return the \*result\* of that mathematical formula. &amp;#x200B; sum = 10 + 3 myarr = \[1, 2, 3\] print(sum(myarr)) #throws exception. Can't use an int like a function print(sum) #13 If you wanted to monkey patch the sum function to do other work when called, you could do the following: def sum(cup, day, month, box): return (cup \* day \* month / box) &amp;#x200B; and then it would behave like that.
This seems like a good problem for a neural network. Maybe feed it the output of a couple dozen regex matchers and train it with a big sample set that you know are either in the class of sites you want to detect or reject. 
&gt; I'm about 80% convinced that what you have here is an XY problem. Beware. See my answer to /u/Supalien's comment. In our special case code generation makes or lives easier. We deal with a 5,400 LOC XSD file. Testing the import code for correctness is more complicated than just testing the code generation code :-)
If anyone is wondering about whether to use *args and **kws to save developing time or drop them to save maintaining time, I think the community has already provided you with a good solution: When developing, just use them if your codes are not performance sensitive. After that, however you should carefully write some python-stub files to provide friendly interfaces for both your IDEs and users. https://github.com/python/mypy/wiki/Creating-Stubs-For-Python-Modules 
What extension based ide are you using?
&gt;Assume you need to build a tool to transform data from format A (i.e. XML) to format B (i.e. a set of Django ORM model instances in memory). Honestly (and I'm not trying to be a dick here), I would want to see a much higher level problem description before diving into how to achieve this using code generation. The number #1 rule of applying code generation is to make **absolutely** sure first that there is no other way to sensibly achieve the goal without code generation. You are opening yourself up to a whole new world of pain and frustration by applying this technique and you need to be **absolutely** sure that it's necessary before you inflict that upon yourself.
I wrote my own: https://codebase.tech/ext
Well, your job is safe, indeed.

Those `return None` lines are unnecessary. All Python functions return `None` by default.

&gt;We deal with a 5,400 LOC XSD file. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me. XSDs are there to validate XML. Validating XML with XSD requires two lines of code no matter how long the file is. If you are just importing certain data from XML then the last thing you want is code generation. You can just parse it and xpath out the data that you need.
Yeah, that's a bit not right.
You should tell exact steps you are doing. Keep in mind if you just load model and without freezing any layers begin trainig you may destroy the whole model. It's recommended to go in stages first retrain last flat layer, then unfroze other layers. See for more ditails here https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
If you're looking for some codegen support stuffs in python, I'd give you some info - Python std module ast - AST to python source code emitter, unparse. https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Tools/parser/unparse.py - AST based scoping analyzer, https://github.com/thautwarm/scoping-resolver

I think you'd be hard put to find any kind of "negative" blogging from large corporate blogs. I don't remember ever reading a corporate blog post about why perl was such a clusterfuck but it still died an untimely death anyway. If you want constructive negativity (and IMO you should), reddit is a better place to get it than blogs. &gt;From my point of view, I see a benefit in increased autocompleteion effectiveness I absolutely see a benefit in getting autocompletion however I can get it without writing a single additional line of code just by embedding IPython at runtime. Moreover, I can see the result in real time too.
I got 31 used modules
I also sped up a piece of code by 154 times once. It was a pandas thing where the person was retrieving 5 values from the pandas array once per iteration, for many many iterations. It originally took 18 minutes, I went in and changed it to just get the numpy array out using the .values on the dataseries, and then used a split method to just get the 5 values. Took 7 seconds after that.
Fair point. I shall proceed. I have 3 models to build, one with VGG16 fully frozen, second model with VGG16's last layer 5 unfrozen, and third model with VGG16 fully unfrozen. In more details, I load VGG16, remove the fully-connected top layers and introduce my own (Add your own fully connected layers (one with 256 nodes using ‘relu’ activation and output layer with 5 nodes and ‘softmax’ activation)). Then, for the first model, I freeze VGG16 and add it my two new fully connect layers, run grid search and make predictions on test set. For the second model, I unfreeze the last layer (layer 5) of VGG16 and add it my two new fully connect layers, run grid search and make predictions on test set. For the third model, I fully unfreeze VGG16 and add it my two new fully connect layers, run grid search and make predictions on test set. For the first two models, I get great results. For the last model, I get subpar results. Interestingly, if I run Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 in that order, I get great results on Model 1 and Model 2, but terrible results on Model 3. Also, if I run Model 1, Model 3, and Model 2 and in that order, I get good results on Model and Model 3, but terrible results on Model 2. Thanks!

We need all the possible data. We have import and export code and the XSD gets extended often causing us to extend our code often. We decided after four years of extending it manually, that code generation helps us for certain reasons. It's not just an out of the gut "oh we could do this automatically because we have nothing better to do". We want to do it right once, so we have less work in the future (in ten years the XSD might be 50,000 LOC).
Type hinting in this way just hurts... Why not separate hints from your runnable codes? Say, write a python stub file for that? 
&gt;Learn Python 3 the Hard Way byZ. A. Shaw you lost a lot of credibility right here. You are using material from a guy who didn't understand what a bytearray is, wrote an article "The case against Python3" and made a complete fool of himself. He luckily cornered some market but he seems to be lacking fundamental concepts and, I tl;dr a response to his idiotic article here for you: *But Zed's article seems to encourage bad programming habits from the beginning* Please drop that material from this guy.
Okay, good case to explain why should we learn a framework carefully. And you might get a better performance if you directly use a split alternative in pd.DataFrames. I remember .values makes a copy.
Haha, yea. Testing was a bit of a workout.
Are you transferring the weights from model1 to 2 to 3? Or are these all independant?
good point, I don't use pandas much I'll look into it.
Using opencv I assume ?
Are you literally using **all** of the data **right now** or do you just want the ability to grab the data from the ingested XML at some point in future? I'm also still perplexed as to why XSD changes are causing you to extend your code often. XSD is just there to validate XML; nothing more. If the actual *structure* of the XML is changing and you have to change your code to accommodate data that was in "products_range/products" and is now in "data/products" that's different but again I can't see how code generation is going to help. &gt;We want to do it right once, so we have less work in the future (in ten years the XSD might be 50,000 LOC). At which point, if used for its intended purpose, it will still be two lines of code to validate XML input.
All independent. 
Relatively new to python, got introduced to it in my networking class but have been doing c++ for a while hardcore. My first project with python is a license plate recognition system, using Keras and tensorflow backend to train some nets using my own data in python to then use the models for in my c++ implementation. Love how plug and play the language feels should be a fun endeavor! I never thought I would be able to add a library so easily thank you pip!!!’
Have you tried the official docs for pygame? I recommend you find something that does approximately what you want on GitHub or within the list of games published on the pygame website.
Ok. Now its clear where mistake is. When you slap a new fully connected layer on top of your model weights of that layer are initialized randomly. That leads to destruction of weights of the rest of the model. So you have to first freeze everything up to the last layer, thrain it for a few epochs. Save the model, then reload it and only after that unfreeze every layer. So the last layer isnt initiated randomly and model as a whole wont have huge loss at the beginig. Again, read the blog, that pitfall is described there.
Create a system to apply an extendable set of combined and weighted rules to the page. Cache the html so you can efficiently re-run with updated rules. I think you should look for words like you mentioned, but also URLs and other structures in the page that match with popular webshops (woocommerce, shopify etc). Links to stripe or payment processors etc.
what is your channel name? id like to learn
We already validate. Validation is part of our import. You couldn't write an import at that size without a validation step. We only import valid XML files. We even fix corrupt XML files before we import them. We deal with the problem to constantly have to rewrite the import and we just want to automate it. I know there are a lot of smart people on Reddit and some think after listening to someones problem description for five minutes, that they know more about the underlying problem that the people who were working four years with it. No offense, I know you only want to help. The engineers here know what they do. That XSD grows to 50k LOC in the next ten years and we would have to constantly change our import and export code, without being able to test the code to the right extend, because you don't really know what kind of (valid) XML file the users are able to come up with, because the complexity of the XSD. I know the best solution would be not to have an XSD file or just not to change it, but life isn't a wishing game. You have to deal with old specifications and when the people in the sector do things like that, you have to find a working solution. You cannot just change the standards. That's why we go away from our manually written import/export and we want to generate the import/export code so we have correct import/export code as long as the code generation works correctly, which is easier to test because we only have to translate a subset of XSD specifications to a set of Django model definitions (a bit like [generateDS](http://www.davekuhlman.org/generateDS.html)).
I just took a side job programming for a SOC board to read sensors and process the data. I exported the data to a web interface. Many people use it for websites, data processing, fast text manipulation there are hundreds of uses for it in the professional world. I used to use it to write repetitive code for data access layers in C#. I just watched a video of a guy who uses python to write algorithms for the stock market predictions.
Here is one example. My organization does an annual SOC 2 audit. One of the things the auditors need is evidence of change management. I wrote a script to query our SCM's web service API to get a list of changes and approvals and generate a report.
Amazing.... Greetings from Brazil!!!
Might not be the "A" answer but for me Python is my data manipulation and automation tool. For our organization, it seems like we have a number of systems that require data parsed in to particular formats. Using Python to reformat, transform data to other values, and to glue data together from a number of sources has been critical to feeding various platforms around the organization. As an automation tool to either scrape websites, automate web interactions with Selenium, or parse logs looking for issues has been helpful. It's the ease of use and ability to search quick solutions to issues that give it that almost default tool status when we are looking solve problems.

random thoughts &amp;#x200B; Reading the AST crash course it reminds me of the power of lisps choice to use sexps -- they are meeting the macro language half way and consequently there is no *AST Hell*. I've found python more useful than lisp in my daily life. Most likely because of the hard work that has gone into making Python easy to use and ubiquitous but I still fantasize about having the power of lisp macros available to me. The direction I've always thought of was somewhat kludgy but still appealing to me none the less: 1. create an sexp version of language X (e.g. C) 2. use lisp as the macro language for 1. Of course the Python community has done **a lot of work** to provide language features that reduce the need/desire for macros 1. generators &amp; coroutines 2. expressive (thanks to the base language) frameworks and extensions. exemplars: scipy, numpy+friends 3. meta-classes and decorators I'm sure the list goes on and on.
If you pay me
It sounds like you are doing a lot of refactoring to solve a specific problem - because that's similar to what I would do in that situation. Introspect the code to see what it's doing, write a test for it, and then you're free to refactor it. But, (1) Is there reason to not add annotations in that case for the next time this happens, and (2) What does embedding iPython do that you can't do in a good IDE's embedded interpreter &amp; debugger? I think there's plenty of "Why we stopped using/will not use X" posts out there.
If it's your own task, you should make it on ypur own. Iterate over all points, for each, get its location, search locations for all neighbors that are tagged by *. 
Seems like you should add a docstring. I would be easier to see the difference.
lol
Let me get this straight: you have a homework assignment you can’t do, so you think asking *reddit* is a good idea?
&gt;Honestly (and I'm not trying to be a dick here), I would want to see a much higher level problem description before diving into how to achieve this using code generation. The people here did think thoughtfully about it. I really didn't intend to make this a threat about "Why you shouldn't do code generation" :) &gt; Additionally, code generation code requires probably 3-7x as much automated testing as regular old code in order to ascertain the same level of confidence that it is functioning as expected. Not in this case. Assume you have a 5k LOC XSD file and you have to write code to be able to read, store and write every single attribute, every relation and every element, optional or required, one up to (theoretically) infinite many. Now assume you constantly increase the size of that XSD file every half a year. You could try to generate a lot of XML data to increase your testing coverage, but in the end it might really be easier to just generate that import/storage/export code from the XSD file and make sure the code that translates the XSD to Django models works as expected.

Instead, you might want to start with a business project, then determine which tool to use. I've used all three heavily in business -- I've built semi-automated systems with Excel, performed big data analysis with R, and coded entire web sites (with Django stack) and data manipulation tools (with pandas) in Python. Each of them is a good fit for slightly different things. You can solve problems with any of them individually, but the biggest skill is knowing the right language for the right job (or alternatively, that the language doesn't matter).
If you're able to use Python &gt;3 6 look into type hints and mypy. Gives you a lot of the good parts of static typing, but you still have all the dynamic goodness of Python available. Helps me a lot in larger projects.
One of the best things that you can achieve using python is how easy and fast you can automate processes and things in general. In my company we use python in image processing, from noise recution to image matching. The key is that we don't spend months developing that such apps, using python we do it in matter of weeks, and so that we saved money to the company. Now, python isn't meant for big projects, or at least it's recommended in that case to use other programing languages. To finish, python has a lot of libraries that ease the data processing, plotting, math and science calcs. If I start talking of what it can be done using python I'd never end. So, go ahead and learn python, you'll never regret it and It will help you in the future for sure.

In the case of python, I feel there's a shared cultural trait, namely human friendliness. python is short and light to read and type (literals, for-comp etc) and you can very rapidly override syntactic hooks (logical or arithmethic operators etc).

Fristly, python f-string is quite similar to C#'s @$ ones. Secondly, a python statement is strictly distinguished from others for python uses layout indentation, which means it's easier to get along with, at the cost of lossing expression first features like multiline lambdas.
Speaking of PySimpleGUI... the new PySimpleGUIWeb port makes it "dead simple" (Simple is right there in the name) to create a GUI on the web that will launch an app. Here's what one of these front-ends could look like in use: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54076131-e3aec780-4275-11e9-81ea-6b697b6e9064.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54076131-e3aec780-4275-11e9-81ea-6b697b6e9064.gif) You can see it running live in your browser, modify the code if you want to experiment, by going here: [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Command-Line-Front-Endpy](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Command-Line-Front-Endpy) If you decide you would rather run it on the desktop instead of the web, then it's only 1 line to change in your code for that import PySimpleGUIWeb as sg to import PySimpleGUI as sg The result is that you'll see a desktop window that looks like this: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54076169-5455e400-4276-11e9-84ad-c2e635203998.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54076169-5455e400-4276-11e9-84ad-c2e635203998.gif)
Are you reading it in notepad or some shit? Python is just as easy if not easier to read than curly brace languages in vscode and every other ide I have used. Even in vim it's easy to read, not so easy to write in vim though I'll give you that. 
This question is asked frequently here or in r/learnpython. This really comes down to what you do at your company. How someone in finance uses python is not going to help you in shipping and vice versa. Also what issues you currently face? Think about what you do that is either unpleasant, or takes up all your time. If your lucky it’s both and you can automate it. Also yes you can do thing with excel or python or R or JavaScript. When your eating you can break up your food with the side of your spoon, fork, or use a knife. All have their advantages and disadvantages. Some are ideal for the task, but you may not have the ideal tool at the time. If your good you learn to use all of your utensils but are ready at that BBQ when all you get is a spork 
&gt;The people here did think thoughtfully about it. I'm actually growing more and more convinced that they didn't and that you're above to dive headlong into a massively complex and difficult waste of time. Your call. For anybody else who is reading this: **do not fall into the same trap, please**. &gt;Not in this case. In ALL cases. If you write 150 lines of regular code then I expect you to need maybe 80 lines of test code to cover it properly. If you write 150 lines of code that does code generation then you'll need maybe 500-600 lines test code to cover it simply because code generation code is much more prone to bugs.
Super cool! I’m going to try this out tonite. I’ll let you know how it goes.
See https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials Pygame is getting a bit long in the tooth though. Why not look into pysdl2? It's not *that* much more complicated and I've you've finished you'll know the SDL2 API if you decide to move to C/C++.
I thought so, as I've been looking for something like that for awhile. Is it open source?
Notepad++, yeah. I mean it's not that I'm incapable or anything, it's just more of a pain in the ass to work off of nothing but indentations, and not even having semicolons or something similar to end statements doesn't help either. Was just curious if it's this much of a hamper on others.
&gt;It sounds like you are doing a lot of refactoring to solve a specific problem ??? I do refactoring to clean up code, like anybody else. I don't tend to use ipython when doing so though - I move code around, delete it and add it and then run the tests to confirm I didn't break anything. &gt;But, (1) Is there reason to not add annotations in that case for the next time this happens, I don't see annotations as a better form of code introspection. If anything it's a worse form of code introspection because it doesn't tell you as much and it's easier for it to get out of sync with what the code actually does. &gt;(2) What does embedding iPython do that you can't do in a good IDE's embedded interpreter &amp; debugger? It lets me do code and docstring lookup on the fly, it does tab autocompletion and it lets me experiment by running snippets code and seeing what they do instantaneously all within the context of the specific code I'm working on right now. Then I can copy and paste back working code that I've tried. A good IDE's embedded interpreter and debugger might do all of the same things easily enough. If it can, great. Point being that zero additional code is required to make all this work. Point being autocompletion at runtime is *trivial*. Autocompletion in IDEs *pre* runtime in a dynamically typed language, however is a different story - they require type annotations or funky, unreliable code introspection in order to work. 
&gt; I'm actually growing more and more convinced that they didn't and that you're above to dive headlong into a massively complex and difficult waste of time. I think you shouldn't assume that much. From your responses I conclude that you still don't understand what we do (you suggest things that don't work because you don't know the details). I blame it on me not going into details, but I really don't want to make this a thread about our problems and our solutions to it and whether there are people who think they know better ;) This is a thread about code generation tools. I think we should just stick to the topic and not discuss whether the engineers who worked with the problems in the recent four years are idiots, because they came to the conclusion that code generation helps in that special case. I'm also restricted in what I disclose and I really don't want to argue about it at all (that train already left the station).
&gt;I don't see annotations as a better form of code introspection. If anything it's a worse form of code introspection because it doesn't tell you as much and it's easier for it to get out of sync with what the code actually does. Annotations aren't really a replacement for introspection. They provide documentation enforced by a contract. It's harder for them to "get out of sync with what the code does" when the build system can be setup to reject a commit based on annotations. Documentation is under no such restrictions and can more easily become outdated.
Would love to have 
Thanks. Looks like there are two approaches: 1. Generating an AST and pretty printing it to a file. 2. Having file templates and filling them with values. 
It was a 5 month track, for python web development. The biggest take away was 'how to learn' so to speak. Basically they don't teach you what you need to do the job, because the entire job is learning. After being hired on and having worked over a year, I've branched out from primarily python restful apis in flask and falcon frameworks to building tooling in Go and infrastructure in AWS Cloudformation. I'm pretty confident 'forward' is any direction I choose in the current market.
Did this ever get **any** response from the OP? Sounds amazing. 
Except if you're running an embedded interpreter already for most of the code you write, it doesn't actually make the job of introspection easier - runtime introspection is equally trivial with or without annotations. Keeping all of your annotations up to date still imposes a massive overhead though. &gt;It's harder for them to "get out of sync with what the code does" when the build system can be setup to reject a commit based on annotations. This is true. However, in practice I've seen this build step dropped for similar reasons to why I've seen lint build steps dropped - the ratio of false positives to real positives was too high to justify interrupting the build process every time it flagged an issue.
&gt; From your responses I conclude that you still don't understand what we do I fully agree. However, i asked: &gt;I would want to see a much higher level problem description before diving into how to achieve this using code generation. Are you trying to get structured data out of XML and put it in a database? Why? What's trying to use it once it gets in there? Do you even need all of the data? What benefit would be gained by using django ORM models here? And you never responded.
Thanks, iam excited to hear what you think about it and what could be done better.
This would be better suited for r/learnpython. 
And I already said that I didn't make this threat to discuss why code generation solves our problem. It's like you make a thread about pain medication and someone hijacks it to suggest the problem is the cause of the pain and you shouldn't use medication at all. That might be right, but sometimes you cannot get rid of the cause and people who suffer from pain might just want to know all about pain medication ;)
No, it's like a teenager made a thread asking how to commit suicide and somebody hijacks it to suggest that other solutions deserve to be given a lot more thought first before heading down this road.
Using that would likely be simpler than creating something on your own with Django
If your annotations are wrong, don't you have a code problem that needs fixing, rather than just turning them off? When adding annotations to an existing project, can't you do it one section at a time?
in a nutshell, you are assigning your_num to the function input, rather than its return value. So when you try to convert it to an int, it complains that it can't turn a function into an int. You want to assign your_num to the return of input like this: ``` your_input=input("Your number:")``` 
&gt;If your annotations are wrong, don't you have a code problem that needs fixing I have found that mypy flagging a problem doesn't necessarily prove that there is actually a bug that needs fixing.
Then your results make sense to me. Follow the process in the keras blog the other person linked you
Maybe I'm just biased since I have been using Python, but I'm sure within a week or 2 you would get used to the indentation. You should look at vscode if you haven't used it before. I love it for all languages. 
I am on 2 projects: 1) write a script to take a numeral and write it in words in my native language (Greek) and then make plots on how many letters/characters each number, translated to words have (almost done) 2) write a compile home control module (lights, chromecasts, media server, A/C, heating, security cams, electric water heater, kettle and anything that might come up) Any ideas? Mainly on no. 2
You seem to have strong feeling about this topic. We won't touch the generated code at all. We will only maintain the generator code. The generated code is pure boilerplate stuff that describes how an entity in an XSD file gets imported, stored and exported from the database handling all special cases that could occur. Believe me, you really don't want to write and maintain that code manually when the XSD file grows to 50k LOC.
See? We all know this stuff! Nobody ever bothers to explain **low** performance data processing in Python. :-(
There's some [useful writing](https://instagram-engineering.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881) on this from Instragram engineering (who claim to be the world's largest Python codebase) &gt; the returns on static type checking are low until we reach a critical mass of type-annotated code, especially our core frameworks and libraries &gt; Our first forays into manually adding type annotations were discouraging. It can take hours to annotate a single module, sometimes painstakingly tracing through multiple layers of function calls and objects to understand the possible types at some call site. But after doing all this work, they seem very happy about it. It's true that mypy having a fit doesn't necessarily mean there is a bug for sure, the same way as the C/Java compiler telling you an implicit float/int conversion has occured: but it's something that should be looked into.
Care to share? :-)
I agree on several points, but LPTHW has something to recommend it on pedagogical approach, and that is orthogonal to whether we agree with the author on Python 3.
So me and my supervisors (Astrophysics PhD) were discussing with some undergrads on how important python has become and how good it is for them to add it to their skills in their CV. My point was that just saying "I know python" doesn't mean shit, unless you can show your original work with it. Even if you've used a module, that doesn't mean you've actually used it on something useful, original and with actual know-how. That said, I really enjoyed the module ;)

All this Hue sounds amazing - but isn't it incredibly expensive? Or not?
This sounds like my coffee grinder...it has a push button rather than an on/off button. 
in python3 Tkinter was renamed to tkinter. Try from tkinter import * Or, since wildcard imports are bad and against PEP8: import tkinter as tk --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Something that would be nice is a guide showing how to do to do something in ggplot and the equivalent code in matplotlib.
Thanks 
Great! Join us. But you should remove your professor’s name as it’ll show up in google.
As I said - used all of these googled commands. None of it works. And as I also already said - Linux Mint (19, the most recent), Python 2.7
Nope they’re really tight on stuff like this.
Great. Join the stream tomorrow.
Closed source. What do you want to do with it? 
Your error is because your import is wrong. Use the import I gave you. 
The world needs to know
I did that. It doesn't work. 
Does it have intellisense support for Python? I've considered making the switch but am using an offline PC atm so it's a royal pain in the ass to set up with downloading the packages to my phone and transferring/installing from there. Need to get some new antennas for my wireless card before I can give it a proper go. I think you're right, I will likely get used to it. It's just with any previous languages I've learned I haven't had any struggle reading through so this has just been a different experience for me.
Be nice.
When I use import tkinter as tk it shows "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
When I use import tkinter as tk it shows me: "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
Anyone works with me contact me privately.
Your syntaxerror must be elsewhere, because that import is ok. Show us the whole error message. 
This was my first thought too. "Great, lisp-like macros! But in a non-sexp language, that's hell."

My bad. Forgot to change "from" to "import", but the first message still shows: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/hauptmann/.PyCharmCE2018.3/config/scratches/Excel_sample.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; import tkinter as tk ImportError: No module named tkinter
I'll bet you are still in python2. Add this to the top to see import sys print(sys.version) If that shows 2.7 then you need to change the pycharm interpretor to python3. I'll let someone who uses pycharm help you with that. 
I do use 2.7, I even said that in the post. I also used Python 3 as an interpreter and it does the same thing.
I thought you were asking about using python3. In python2 you use the capitalized version. import Tkinter as tk But why would you use python2? Want to be the last person on Earth to use it or something?
!remindme 26 hours
To be honest - used 2.7 to try if Tkinter works on it, because all of the things you told me I already did on both of the interpreters and it always shows the same thing.
One great moment of grad school was when an over-confident grad student told me, "Yea, I know Python. I mean, I'm no expert or anything. But yea, I know it. Some more advanced concepts are still tough, like, uh, for-loops and stuff..." As they say, "You don't know what you don't know."
You'd have much fun fun writing this in C
Oh, I wanted to see how you did it. But that's ok, you made it and it's part of how you make your livelyhood. You don't owe me or anyone a look at the code. 
No offense, but it sounds like pycharm is too advanced for you right now. Use idle or geany or similar for now, and come back to pycharm in a few months, after you've learned how to use virtual environments. Also highly recommend python3. Much better and not about to expire.
But it's just comfortable for me to use PyCharm. I'm fine with the look of it, it's just nice to use. Also I came here for the solution, not advice. I appreciate it, but I'll stick to PyCharm. :) So if you have any idea what went wrong and how to solve my problem - go on. 
looks epic, imma check it out
As I said, I bet you are using pycharm's default virtual environment instead of the system interpretor. 
Not C, but I might port this to C++ some day
&gt;LPTHW has something to recommend it on pedagogical approach Can you expand on that? It seems his approach is to use a bad (i.e. false not just incomplete) analogy. Then later tell you that the prior analogy is bad and here's a new one and we're going to change the names of every concept now. I find it not appealing on pedagogical grounds, but maybe I'm missing something.
No, I use system interpreter. I know where the settings are and how to choose system interpreter instead of virtualenv. :D It points to /usr/bin/python3.7 so I assume it's all correct.
/r/learnpython
That's very true. Reminds me of my first supervisor, back when I was an undergrad myself. I was pouting because python was so great compared to Matlab and Fortran77 (the mandatory programming we were taught as physics undergrads in my university. His reply was that in order to be able to work in higher-end languages like python, one has to start low. There's no use assembling modules and pre-defined functions if you can't in the long run write your own. And 'for loops' are core stuff
Lol you're confusing. Didnt you just tell me you want to use python2? I'm pretty sure the system python3 on the latest mint is 3.6, not 3.7. The repo installs (apt-get, not pip) will install for 3.6. 
Was just referring to semicolon replacement, seems like you didn't catch it ;P
I would need to see an example of that. I'm referring to the idea that it's supposed to be hard and that menial exercises force the learner not to skip things and mistakenly think they've understood. LPTHW wouldn't have worked for me as a student, but I've taught hundreds of students and I think this approach is good for a large proportion,
To make it clear - I tried to use it to check if tkinter works on it. I should've precise the fact I'll use 3.7 in general. Also, you're right. For some reason PyCharm shows me 2.7, 3.7, but when I type "python3.7" in console it doesn't show up, but if it's "python3.6" it does. I confused myself even more. 
That sounds really bad and ineffective. The healthy tree can produce good fruits. The unhealthy tree cannot.
This is awesome. I have another idea that I think would be cool too. You should give a two week class on Python on twitch and make it like an hour or two each day. Then after each class, do a Q&amp;A answering peoples questions for like 30min to an hour. Then get on twitch a couple days a week for an hour or so(with a schedule in the bio) and answer peoples questions and maybe do live challenges with people. Twitch already encourages people to donate so that would be great for everyone.
Oh I'd love to, pity it might be spoiled by our competitors. 
I'm switched from C# to Python one year ago and in the very beginnign had same experience. In a week or so you will forget about not having curly brackets, just continue to read the code. Also try PyCharm, it's amazing IDE, it really helps me after my 10 years expirience with Visua Studio.
What are you talking about? 
Holy shit that was good, I learnt a ton. Thanks for taking the time!
 [ !, @, # ] .pop -&gt; [ !, @] -&gt; # like this? lol Or you could just do this [ 0, 1, 2 ] .pop -&gt; [ 0, 1] -&gt; 2 but that's not very visual. Neither are artful. 
Just use the sort symbols from the post and follow his syntax in the sort example, but make the arrow on the right point to the popped value.

Yeah it has intellisense for every language I've used on it. Python, Ruby, powershell, c#, php, plus any changes configs like Json or yaml
yea true
Nope, that was a pretty accurate summary of the video. 
Web based services, automation, data transformation. I used Django and Flask to run web servers, those servers provide access to a UI where users can make a selection, press a button, and get something they want. The button makes a call to an API that triggers automated tasks and responds with the results of said task.

Hey that's awesome! I tried to run it and I can't get the same menu as you got up. I ran app.py and was able to switch it to the space background in the code, but couldn't get the menu to come up. Running main.py gets the menu to appear, but it doesn't give me a drop down list to choose from anything. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? 
Nope. I've been using Twitch for many many years and I've always seen people programming. They used to have a whole category dedicated to it. Now it kinda falls under the [science &amp; technology category](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology). In fact, they have a special tag on Twitch called 'programming' [here](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology?tl=1) that falls under science &amp; tech. I just checked and there's a ton of streams on there programming. Also, one of my favorite streamers does coding streams with like 500 concurrent viewers almost daily and has been doing that for at least well over a year now. Also, if you did a class type thing, I believe it would qualify more as a talk show and they have a [category](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Talk%20Shows%20%26%20Podcasts) for that too. Twitch has actually pushed harder to drive people into IRL streams which is why they divided up IRL into a dozen or so categories. They actually want to expand on it.
This is a good warning on a security front. With the rise of password locker apps, where it's easy to look up a password, and copy the password into the clipboard, this kind of attack could be sneaky (even without modifying the clipboard contents).

I fail to see where the distinction between constructor and initialzser really matters. Maybe as a red flag in an interview to determine that you'd definitely not want to work at a company where an anal retentive gloating over that fact was allowed a part of the hiring process.Otherwise, just like meta classes, 98% will never have to care about the difference.
Thank you for the explanation, seems an awful bumpy road ahead for this project.

Geez.. A simple post in this reddit would have done it.. No reason to get nasty about it.
When I was little SAMS had "Teach yourself ___ in 24 hours". It didn't work then, but it's nice to see how much technology has advanced.
Really well written. Cheers.
Someone do this but replace less than with greater than but only at random intervals 
Relax bud
🤷 stressful day. Why is it so hard to do such basic things?
Why do you NOT want to simply call the functions in order? Do you expect the list of functions to change? If so, a list of functions is the way to go: fnlist = [ function1, function 2, ] for func in fnlist[start:]: func() 
yes, teaching something from an author who had/has things fundamentally wrong and uses a highly critized teaching style is something that matters when teaching beginners. I dug out the articles I'm referring to for you: [https://medium.com/@poke/the-case-against-the-case-against-python-3-ae4eb4038e0e](https://medium.com/@poke/the-case-against-the-case-against-python-3-ae4eb4038e0e) and [https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW\_Complaints](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints) with this being my favorite wtf of them: *After teaching methods in 38, Ex 39 teaches dictionaries and… how to build a hash table class?!* &amp;#x200B; regarding your point in having luck teaching hundreds of students. It's easy to teach a highly abstracted programming language to beginners, it's also easy to teach a person to get the greatest common divisor by typing gcd() but that doesn't make them good at math. Anyway, I'm not here to argue with you or anything. I just wish you wouldn't use materials from this clown, that's all.
Well sometimes due to token expiration the script does not complete. Therefore instead of running from the first function I just want to be able to basically start-from an specific function and go from there.
Go to /r/learnpython
no worries! thank you for that feedback :) duly noted for future reference
Thanks for the interest! I haven't looked at the code in a while and can't really offer advice working with the source. Some day I'll get around to cleaning it up. Have you tried a build from the release page? There you should find main.exe. https://github.com/Elizabwth/win-shader-wallpaper/releases
Mmm... In my opinion, both of your answers give the correct answers. So why are they wrong??? Maybe Your teacher wants some elegant implementations???
Omg thank you so much lol. I didn't find the release page. And no problem. I think it would be cool if you enlarged the ui to make it like wallpaper engine but nicer. I feel like it could be the next wallpaper engine killer with not very much more work. And no worries about the source. I know python so I can eventually figure it out lol. I just think the version I got earlier was an early incomplete version.
Frankly, I wouldm't use pygame today. It's API is clunky and unpythonic. Nonetheless, you should begin with the official examples and docs (it's a really ugly bright green website). I'd use pyglet or vispy/glumpy if you want to directly work with OpenGL, or Pandas3d if you want a more fully featured project.

This kind of thing has been a danger for a while since passwords have high information entropy (they are closer to random than a standard English phrase) you can detect them from a stream of characters, e.g. a keylogger, and steal them. In order to protect yourself: 1. Wherever possible use in-browser form-fill password managers. These will operate inside the browser sandbox and are less likely to be compromised. 2. Do not type your master password on an untrusted computer. This roughly means anyone's computer but your own personal device. 3. Do not install software from an untrusted source. This roughly means software that came signed with a public PGP signature that proves it is from the source you thought it was.
What is the youtube link you would be streaming live on? I am super interested! 
i think #1 might be more theoretical, given how easy it would be to get an app into chromes appstore or firefox without open source
This is pretty rad
Yes thank you, I have considered the alternative approach as you said - scan for their platforms using BuiltWith, WhatCMS, SimilarTech, and other popular services out there. While this is somewhat reliable many of the urls return custom platforms and taking only the popular ones like Magento, BigCommerce, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc. - the output might be low and I may be missing on many legit ones. Appreciate the suggestion though!
Thank you for the suggestion. It's definitely something that I will look into.
Absolutely right on. This will be my next approach - take a already known e-commerce dataset about 100K and scan the most commonly used words frequency wise and train the scraper. It will be a lot of trial and error but ultimately a more accurate result. Appreciate your suggestion.
Caching the HTML is something that I hadn't thought about. Great suggestion, appreciate it.

Well I am using Python for the purpose, so yes Python specific. Not much of a programming issue, just floating around the idea and seeking suggestions and whether anybody else has done it before. If I required help with coding, I would have definitely posted in the right sub. Thanks anyways for your input.

Almost all visual novels are renpy. Mount &amp; Blade and Civilisation 4 use python for gameplay scripting. 
Write a program to take an image file and a text string and encode the string in the image data, producing a new encoded image that looks sort of the same as the original image. Then write a decode program to get the text back out of the encoded image. This will give you practice at getting image data from an image file, getting a list 1, 2 or 4-bit values from a text string, updating and saving a new image file, etc. Once you have something that works extend it to allow unicode characters like emoji and foreigh languages. Then make your code use generator functions instead of lists to save memory. Let your code handle encoding *any* file whether it's a text file, mp3 sound file or even another, smaller, image file. Modify your program to use a GUI. And so on.

The Sims 4 uses Python internally. 
I think you mean ;P
Ok I'm biased cuz I'm a student with minimal financial influx atm, but that seems waaay overpriced to me (like stupidly so). There are loads of intro-to-python playlists on Youtube that can take you from "how do I install Python" to a level of proficiency where you are able to learn new things on your own when you encounter them. Some personal favs: * [sentdex's Python3 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln) - he's also got Flask, data analysis, and ML based playlists. * [Corey Schafer's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&amp;list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) -- a super eloquent dude who [started coding pretty late in life by his own admission](https://realpython.com/interview-corey-schafer/) You could probably find more playlists, tips, and resources over at /r/learnpython. If you want an online-course, then a quick google search brought up Coursera's ["intensive Python course"](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/programming-with-python) which shows up as an 8-week course for ~$200.00; maybe start with that before dropping $4K into a similar thing. I know that you aren't really asking for advice, but if I were learning a new language myself, I'd start from free resources -&gt; cheap resources -&gt; less cheap resources. And this is just my personal opinion, but there are soooo many Python libraries, frameworks, packages, etc... that it's almost impossible/useless to try to learn them all, so your instinct to just get to a point where you can learn by yourself is very much on point (though I really think that dropping $4k to get there is unnecessary). Good luck dude!
I'll try, but I hope you noticed I'm a noob at Python, ctypes, and github, so it's going to be more like fumbling toward something that works rather than intentionally architecting a solution.
These are language basics. Maybe the moderators don't agree (the moderation rules here aren't very useful) but this is more the sort of thing that people would actually be interested in over at r/learnpython.
Haha 🤣 
I appreciate the thoroughness of your answer but I’m specifically looking into feedback regarding classroom style courses as well as the potential networking benefits that come with it
They changed their policy ages ago
No. That subreddit is used for questions. Secondly, is this the first time you are seeing a tutorial on this subreddit? Because I see it all the time.
What kind of feedback specifically? If it's about the syllabus you linked to, it does cover the basics and dive into more specialized stuff like object-oriented programming, pandas, and flask. I noticed the lack of numpy and matplotlib, but that might be covered in the pandas section. It doesn't cover anything that the free resources don't cover though. If you want advice on how to get feedback on your code, then the MIT courses typically have ~5 assignments of increasing difficulty and the solutions. They also usually have videos of the lecture, so you're basically getting a MIT-level course experience for free. 
The difference between constructor and initializer matters greatly in several languages. Nevertheless, that’s not the point. The point is that the way this works in Python is derived from one of it’s most basic rules. For me that’s the most interesting, not the semantics themselves. As to the usability of this observation - knowledge about internal workings of a language may be perceived as useless, up to the moment where you need someone who actually has that information. I, personally, rather want to know how things actually work rather than pretend that magic happens underneath (Feynman’s fan here). But I understand that not everybody has that urge. As to hiring - if I have to make a decision about working with somebody, the actual skill and knowledge is only a part of my evaluation. Persons attitude towards knowledge itself and being showed wrong by somebody else would be as important or maybe even more important to me.
Making it mobile friendly would include a lot of work, and the fact even the desktop version is still under development and I know enough about mobile app development I'd rather make a mobile app that communicated with the site as a server once there's a need for it.
Scrape the sourcecode of the sites and make a list of krywords that would identify it as a shop, keywords as cart, checkout ect. 
Please don't thx

I am looking to soak up whatever you have to teach
Agree! When you are newbie you think you will do just fine learning the language alone but, over time it gets harder to digest and process the whole information alone....
That should be pretty doable with current code
You can create a UTC aware timezone using datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) Then you can apply .astimezone(another_tz_object) but last time I looked at datetime doc, only utc was available so you need pytz. If you already have a naive object and want to make it utc just do dt_obj.replace(tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
Actually if using dateutil.parser.parse I'm sure you can pass a kwarg with default timezone for naive representations ;)
*"80 was the maximum number of characters you could print on a standard A4 (or for those who hate international units: letter) sized paper."* I am curious as to where this assertion comes from. On an A4 sheet, with a 1" (25mm) margin, and using a fixed width font like Courier, you are restricted to 62 characters at 12pt and 68 characters at 11pt (twp common sizes). What typography was used to arrive at the 80 characters value?

i guess more accurate to say 5% of people who are actively looking for python tutorials on youtube are still using python 2. That seems to be an unusual high number. While just 5% of people would seem like a rather low number. There's still some software that actively supports python 2 so i'd say the real usage numbers are a lot higher. That's just what happens when you kill backwards compatibility, you'll have some people stuck there forever. 
As you may have gathered, I'm not a moderator here, and I don't have the time to comment or moderate every single SEO-posted tutorial here either way. Many of r/learnpython's posts are asking questions, but the sub is *about* learning to use the language, which is the topic you are posting about. As you astutely observed your post is not very likely to be removed when it's posted here, but it's less topical in a sub that is specifically about news than to one that is specifically for people actually interested in learning the basics.

Hi there Since you have lat long data you could do some geographical plotting with matplotlib or plot.ly cloropleth or bubble maps. If your data is in csv xlsx formats you can use pandas to read those files into a dataframe and perform transformations on them. You can also use seaborn to make some pretty visualisations. It's probably best to ask yourself "what do I do on a daily basis that takes up a buttload of time and isn't interesting." There you have a task suited to automation
How about a nested list comprehension, something like [Object[key] If "property" in key for key in object for object in objects] Should give you a list of any values where their key contains the word property
About a year ago someone analyzed pypi downloads, and found about 90% for python2. That's the opposite extreme looking at what people (probably not devs) are installing. The developers survey was about 45% on python2 IIRC. 
I'd learn from you. 
/r/learnpython 
Maybe you can switch to an angular plot. Those ones are also very good looking as well as being very useful as representations
 @property def session(self): if self._session is None: logger.debug('setting up initial http session') resp = requests.post(self.url + 'login', json=self.credentials) resp.raise_for_status() self._session = requests.Session() self._session.cookies = resp.cookies return self._session Then just use `self.session.get` instead `requests.get`. /r/learnpython
You're awesome, thank you!
Hi, What exactly are you trying to do? Having several versions of python installed at the same time? If yes, you should look into [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Also this post is probably better suited for /r/learnpython 
Finally a LIDAR for 99$ :D When i did my robo is was stuck on ultrasonic [https://github.com/delijati/ultrabot](https://github.com/delijati/ultrabot)
Thanks, helped my a lot.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)

got a basic WAMP ping pong running on w10: backend.py&lt;-&gt;crossbar rooter&lt;-&gt;frontend.py 1. install vm windows10 python 3.7 64 bit visual studio 2015 community edition pip install pywin32api pip install autobahn[twisted] pip install crossbar 2. start router within a new process python_dir/Scripts/crossbar start 3. start backend.py within a new process see autobahn wamp example 4. start frontend.py within a new process see autobahn wamp example see the events flying, took me 3h of my life 😁 if you are intressted i could push a more detailed description into a git repository
I'm not convinced on #1. A major vector to attack password managers has been to trick their auto fill behavior to harvest credentials. These attacks have already been demonstrated.
The raw values from library itself are {angle(0):distance,angle(1):distance............,angle(360):distance} with which we can directly go plot a polar graph but we thought it would be nice if we convert them into polor-coordinate form. We will sure try polar plot also. Thanks for your advice.
&gt; I heard that Python is a slow programming language. How does this manifest itself? Python is an interpreted language and all interpreted languages are "slow". I don't want to get into a whole explanation of what that means or why it is, so let me just answer your question: Python is plenty fast to develop an audio-only game. From your questions, it's clear you'll want to subscribe to r/learnpython. You may also need to find, or develop, a quality Python audio library for the 3D stuff you want to do.
Thank god Reddit isn't 4chan. 
If you're talking about a multiplayer game like Call of Duty, then you probably are going to need to learn a lot more than just Python. But my main advice is to not start into game programming linking about making COD... think about making something really, really simple and learn the concepts. What if you made an audio version of asteroids, where the player hears the asteroids coming and has to move or shoot? If you start off thinking you're going to make COD, you're going to very quickly get frustrated and quit. Baby steps :)
Thanks! :-)
I know it's a pet peeve and I should just let it go, but Christ, if you are going to post blog spam at least have the decency to pretend you give a damn about the subreddit by actually writing a paragraph about the blog post you're spamming.
This guy job searches.
I honestly tried to watch the whole thing, but seriously can't stand this accent and probably will never understand why Indians won't ever try to improve it.
I feel the same about most american accents
I'm not an American, but what's wrong with it? 
Cool. Would y'all like an explanation on ORM or DRY? Or some other subject maybe? It is valuable for me to practice didactics.. /u/xAlecto /u/levelworm
