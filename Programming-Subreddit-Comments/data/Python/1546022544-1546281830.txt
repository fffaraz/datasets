Look up cx_freeze. It allows you to convert python applications into .exe installers that you can distribute. This way you don't have to try to coordinate everyone having to download all the required dependencies on their own. You can just send them the .exe and it runs like a normal program. Look up Sentdex cx_freeze on YouTube. He has a good tutorial video on how to do this.

Disclaimer: I actually work for O'Reilly. I would definitely say they are great. At least in the area I live and the people I went to school with and previous co-workers and such, O'Reilly was always the first choice for textbooks. A few of my professors in school were huge fans of the "Head Start" book series. O'Reilly also has Safari Books Online ($40/month) and you get unlimited access to all of their published works, many form Pearson, Apress, and a bunch of other publishers as well. So if you need to ramp up fast on some tech, it is really good you drop the cost for a few months and go to town learning. 
(congrats on the SSD, welcome to the future XP) I've always wondered this as well. I get to the point where I'm installing new packages left and right, each have small errors relative to the version of Python I'm using..and then I just get frustrated and wipe everything python-related and just do a fresh install for my current project. Yep, crazy I know. Sometimes I wonder if I should just install/copy a version of python per project, so I know when I come back to it months/years later I will have the peace of mind knowing that it will work. I have read/heard-about installing multiple versions of python and adding them, separately, to your PATH to call on them when needed.. &amp;#x200B;
Hey there! Check out [this post from about a week or so ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a7dcnk/python_virtual_environments_extreme_advertising/) that talks about virtualenv. It's included with python and is the basic way to manage your dependencies. In addition to the helpful (and aggressive) information there, you can also do: - `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` to save your installed dependencies - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies you've previously frozen - `pip list` to see what you have installed There are other dependency management strategies such as [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) but this is the simplest imo. 
Thanks for the advice. I thought about using sqlite, but it seemed like a lot of overhead for one variable. I may, at some point, implement a log of door events and would probably go to a db for that. 
There is some danger in relying completely on tools like Anaconda. This is that danger. I recommend you read about: virtual environment, pip (freeze, requirements), PATH, PYTHONPATH.
Anaconda is handy, but it can get bloated easily as you mentioned. Virtual environments are still the way to go, there was a bunch of third-party tools before, but since Python 3.3 you can use the built-in `venv` tool (even lets you control the interpreter version in the newer releases). You can define a specific environment for each project, selecting the libraries and the interpreter version to be used, independent of your system-wide libraries. This is the best approach to ensure more consistent behavior across multiple environments. Of course you could opt for Docker to have even more control, but this is more lightweight and usually sufficient for smaller projects. Check it out here https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. 
Will "releases" be .py files, .exe or something else? Once someone downloads, do they have to have Python installed to run the program in IDLE or whatever.
Thanks, that sounds promising. 
I use sublime for scripting, and pycharm for projects. Not sure what it is, but visual studio code never clicks for me, no matter what language I try it with.
But not in connection of "its a proof of concept".
I think we're blessed with some really good choices these days. That being said I really like Visual Studio Code for the following reasons. 1. It strikes a great blend of being lightweight and having good features and usability once you install the basic plugins. I like PyCharm but I'm still newer to Python and it's kind of overkill for me right now. Sometimes having too much can get in the way of me doing my best work. And I develop in languages other than Python, too, so being able to work easily with those languages within the same environment. 2. I appreciate how customizable it is in terms of appearance, workflow, and plugins to add extra functionality. For a lack of a better phrase, it's easy to turn VS Code into an editor that *just feels good*. 3. It is free and open source. While I'm not sure VS Code is practically superior to Sublime Text, at least for my purposes, I prefer to choose the free and open source editor given similar options. (Yes, even from Microsoft.)
Mypy is not a proof of concept
I also use this method of saving my libraries into requirements.txt and installing it across computers. Of course this is because i dont have a lot of side projects that would benefit from having virtualenvs for each
I am by no means an expert and am learning myself. I'm intrigued by pipenv.
I was on the same boat til a couple weeks ago. For work i'd use sublime plus gitblame and pudb/terminal debugging. But for whatever reason i decided to work on my company's production code via my windows machine (so to off load processing). Opening up sublime on windows 10, the fucken title bar being white even though im a stickler about themes. That drove me over the edge and decided to try vs code. Now it's my go to for everything. The gitlens extension is beautiful and really drives the product (fyi made by vs code creator too). I strongly suggest to give it another chance. Basically the editor equivalent of sleeping with a black guy. You never go back once you settle in.
What license are you releasing it under?
This is my nightly routine too😂
Awesome! I need to fix my schedule as well, too much perfectionism and following all those"how to learn effectively" moocs ruined my time scheduling.
I use the default Python installer (Windows) to install Python, and `venv` and `poetry` to manage requirements for each project. `venv` creates a Python virtual environment (basically a project-specific Python setup), and `poetry` keeps track of project packages so it's easier to keep in sync across computers. Basically, I do this to set up a new project: 1. `poetry new [project]` - Creates a basic folder for the project 2. `cd [project]` 3. `python -m venv env` - Creates the virtual environment 4. `env\\scripts\\activate` - Activates the virtual environment 5. `poetry add [package]` - e.g., `poetry add requests` to install the packages you want to use for that project. 6. `git add pyproject.toml poetry.lock` - Add the poetry files to version control Once you've got that, you just have to remember to activate the virtual environment when you're working on the project. 
I'd argue that a virtualenv per project is best practice, but it definitely depends on your usage and workflow. I'm generally working across many projects, all of which have different dependencies. Sometimes dependency updates are breaking, or they released a buggy version. Last thing I'd want is project X to fall apart because I updated something in project Y.
Must be, this is getting interesting. I use Ubuntu (LTS) 18.04, Python 3.6. I installed pip with ```sudo apt install python3-pip```. Couldn't do neither ```pip install pkg``` nor ```pip install pkg --user``` due to permission errors. But they worked with sudo. Still there'd be the module not found error in which case I found out --user when in sudo was installing it to /root... instead of ~/. When online I also found out people doing crazy stuff like ```sudo pip install django```, hence coming to the conclusion that it was a common problem, wrote about it.
Learning from reading is ok to start, but learning by doing is a hell of a lot faster in my experience.
I work with a couple of different scripting languages so I really like VSCode, I can make it do pretty much everything I need for Python and similarly for other languages, so it makes sure I'm not fumbling for keys when I swap.
You probably aren't running a version of VS Code that is free and open source: [https://carlchenet.com/you-think-the-visual-studio-code-binary-you-use-is-a-free-software-think-again/](https://carlchenet.com/you-think-the-visual-studio-code-binary-you-use-is-a-free-software-think-again/) Yet another bait and switch from Microsoft.
Don’t do just one thing. Read books to get the basics. Watch videos to supplement the books and get a visual idea of what’s happening. Then complete practice problems to test your knowledge. You may “know” a concept, but you won’t really understand it until you implement it yourself. 
I'm not sure if faster problems are better than slower problems... but if you like it fast... It seems like you are trying to ask something, but it's hard to figure out what your question is. So, I'll guess: you are disappointed that someone doesn't like `asyncio` and `mypy` because you think those libraries are good. You also think that the number of idiots who like a particular thing make the thing better. You also cannot really see beyond immediate consequences of your or anyone else's actions: in which you are not alone, you are in a very good company of Python core developers and a growing number of fanboys... So, why `asyncio` is bad? 1. It's a lie. It doesn't do asynchronous I/O. But, let's say the authors of the library just weren't articulate enough and didn't know what to call this garbage, so they just happened to choose a buzzword for the name. Kind of repulsive, but not really bad. 2. The real problem is in swiping real problems under the carpet, while preventing actual solutions to problems from being implemented. You cannot seriously claim to have a universal programming language in the 21'st century if you cannot do things in parallel. Too much of modern programming requires that you be able to do things in parallel. And Python cannot. `asyncio` was a third attempt to put roll out a quick patch, and it failed just like the other two because it was essentially a lie. There's no parallelism in the language, and no matter how much wishful thinking went into creating this library, the situation didn't change. 3. The implementation is trash. It's so bad you cannot read it without eventually sliding down your chair and laughing hysterically while rolling on the floor. It's the feeling similar to the one you get when watching Starship Troopers: you cannot tell for sure if the movie is really so dumb, or is it actually a comedy. And why is `mypy` so bad? 1. It's a lie. Any of the three type systems Python has doesn't behave like what this library thinks it behaves. So, it leads to wrong conclusions about the code. Your code, or, even worse, code written by others. 2. I never looked at implementations because I don't care what anyone with that set of ideas would write.
I care
Pillow will let you draw some simple paths on images if that's your goal
What operating system or you using? The options / work flows that available to manage Python environments is different between Unix like systems and Windows.
Does anyone actually use the Cortana search bar there? The first thing I do is hide it but everyone has it there still.
Since you've done development before id suggest to replicate a somewhat similar product you've built, in python3. Then follow PEP8 best practices. Architecture in general depends on the type of feature you're building, regardless of the language used. What you should do, is experiment with design patterns that might have been great for java, for-example AOS, but totally irrelavent in python (because of magic methods). The rest is really brushing up on framework/libraries used for the type of product you're interested in building. If you want to do ML DS then checkout /r/learningMachineLearning sub side-panel.
I type search often
I do too I just press the start button and start typing. I’m not bashing it in anyway I was just interested if it’s something that people use
Nice list, for Python dev I would add fluent in Python. 
Thank you Thank gods i avoided java, i dont like the structural complexity of simple things we can make in interpreted languages or functional programming
&gt; It's a lie. It doesn't do asynchronous I/O. What? Yes it does. You can do other things while you are doing I/O. What is the definition of async to you? &gt; You cannot seriously claim to have a universal programming language in the 21'st century if you cannot do things in parallel. First off, don't blame the GIL on async. Async is not a parallel process issue. It's a blocking issue. You make an SQL or an http call, wait a bit and do something with the results. So should you block or run something else in the meantime? Who even cares about your 8 cores when your code is not compiled? You're obsessing over a 4x speedup (because you can't get 8x), when your code is 1000x slower than it could be if you just C++. 8 cores is a waste of a problem to optimize for anyways. What's the largest number of processesors that you've ever used at once? I've used 2048. 8 cores is a very temporary number of processors. It's this weird, not serial, not highly parallel problem in between state. It's a bad idea to design a language around that. &gt; The implementation is trash. It's so bad you cannot read it without eventually sliding down your chair and laughing hysterically while rolling on the floor. Why don't you rewrite it then? Make your own package. &gt; And why is mypy so bad? It's a lie. Is everything a lie to you? &gt; So, it leads to wrong conclusions about the code. So don't lie to it? Don't try to trick it? What code is completely bug free? Pylint gets things wrong. What linter doesn't? &gt; I never looked at implementations because I don't care what anyone with that set of ideas would write. So Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Instagram, etc. are all idiots...got it.
Yea i hopped between a couple of stacks in my career. First java then .net now python. Java web services setups are the worst, surprisingly, any .net framework that isn't their legacy asp shit is decent. But python is godscent. Not too much obscurity while still letting you dive deep under the hood. Also because of all the hype with ML DS, there's more support for porting Cpp code wrappers than JavaJNI. Basically with python, you won't feel like the language is working against you. And any bullshit comment about it's efficiency should go out the window with python3 (and python2 EOL being next year). Your product can also get boosted with AWS lambda hosting so really why bother with anything else.
Not everyone has to program. Try something else?
I recently hit a couple roadblocks trying to write unit tests for a Celery task that called an `async` function. After a couple hours of troubleshooting, I was able to piece together a working, testable implementation, so I thought I'd share.

If you wish to release your programs with source code, the standard and most common places for that are public Git repositories like GitHub or GitLab. You must know how to use Git (I recommend learning that anyway, even when you decide to close your sources). These repositories allow you also to publish "compiled" binaries (called releases). You can either open your projects to everyone or limit access to specific repository users, but the latter is limited in free plans. 
Fluent Python is great for getting a good understanding of the language. It assumes you already know some python (ex there’s no tutorial), but based on your question I’m guessing you’ll be fine in that regard.
Another great resource is Grokking Algorithms once you get a bit more comfortable with Python and build up a few projects. I started the algorithm book before I had a solid foundation and felt although it was useful, I didn’t have much context to apply it. I’ve since come back to it and found it to be a lot more relatable. Once you get comfortable with the basics, you can begin applying a variety of concepts and boilerplate code to projects that interest you. In my experience, this is really how I was able to solidify and built upon my nightly studying; it also helped me to break out of tutorial/book learning purgatory. Glad I was able to show my partner that I’m not the only one slugging away at python learning each night, haha! 
Came here to ask the same question :D
&gt; the anaconda installer....it got quite messy over time Define "messy", how did it come to this ? &gt; is there a better way? If things like Conda cannot help, then write your own ?
&gt; This is that danger. what's the danger ? not sure what op mean by "messy" 
I use it and like it
Great advice! Thank you.
You may want to feed yourself [a spoonful of Advanced Python per Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9us66v/a_spoonful_of_advanced_python_per_day/).

or a cloud editor like AWS Cloud Nine.
A solid choice I would say. Free and open source. Decently powerful. 
This is affiliate spam. 
Anaconda but this time set up a conda environment for each project with an environment.yml that specifies it completely. This is my setup and regularly work on temporary machines and can get up and running in a few minutes. &amp;#x200B; You can still have a root environment that you install packages on a whim into. But this isn't a problem as long as you keep your projects with known dependencies in their own environments. And there shouldn't be a need to synchronize or backup your root environment. Just install packages as needed. This is what I do and it's never been a hassle
How is “Impractical Python Projects”? Looking to keep practicing with projects while learning django. I’m just getting in to Django, completed “django for beginners” and now reading through two scoops of django but its not project based (and maybe a big advanced for me to absorb enough but helpful). 
&gt; ·competencyin at least one of the following languages: Python, Java, C#, C++ Do you know that the day to day work will even involve Python? &gt; But the problem is i don't know anything about data structures and algorithms Dont let HR talk get to you. google for it and learn a bit. Probably not a big issue. How are you on the other two bullet points (software design and version control)? why limit yourself to one position? Why work for someone else when you can innovate and create for yourself like an entrepreneur would?

I am trying to build a desktop app for my project for testing gui stuff in Python. Currently using PyQt5 and it is going good. However, offical Qt for Python(PySide2) announced by Qt so don't know what will change. I can say I am a bit hyped about this.
 I know how to work with git and GitHub. I want to get real world experience and have no idea. So i was thinking i could get it from a job.
My PyCharm licence expired few days ago and I gave VS Code a shot and let me tell you they did a lot of good things since the last time I tried it. So many 'nice touch' things like automatically activating env, suggesting to install lint/mypy/flake8 etc. Python plugin is really good. Code completion not as good IMO, haven't tested that intellisense thing in depth but seems pretty basic. What I never liked about PyCharm is their own implementations of type checks so most of the time PyCharm will ignore errors while MyPy will pick them up, but MyPy plugin for PyCharm is really basic, on the other hand VSC works with MyPy directly, runs the command that you want with your cofiguration and just shows the errors, which is preferable for me. That was really breath of fresh air, no need to run command manually to check if types are correct. Also since my PyCharm licence expired frontend doesn't work at all which is a bummer, with VS Code I can retain all the plugins and experience while switching back and forth. One tip: Use PyCharm key mapping plugin to ease the transition process if you are switching, helps a lot. Only thing that doesn't work is double shift search.
divorce it
You can use it for other languages as well, it has great intellisense, many plugins and is free :)
I'm not sure what's going on there. I ran the file again to check on Python 3 and 2 and it worked as expected. Perhaps you have a different ast module somewhere on your sys.path that is overriding the standard library ast module. \`\`\`bash $ python3 ast\_example.py {'from': \['pprint'\], 'import': \['ast'\]} $ python -V Python 2.7.15 $ python ast\_example.py {'from': \['pprint'\], 'import': \['ast'\]} \`\`\`
IPP takes you from random name generation to advanced astrophotography analysis code. It gives you the code the use to solve the problem, and goes in depth into every line they use. It does a great job at telling you what's going on as well as introducing you to advanced Python methods and problem-solving. It also gives you a springboard for ideas to make your own projects. For example, I modified the random name generation to create tavern names for my upcoming D&amp;D session, and even created a superhero catchphrase generator. Stupid stuff, but good for exercises.
VsCode is by far the best Python "text editor", and I used to use it so religiously that I found it difficult to make the leap to pycharm. In retrospect, I wish I had more patience and had spent more time with pycharm because now I that I "get it" I cannot go back. Yes, it takes longer to load and indexing is slow AF and the fonts look like shit compared to VsCode, but the debugger is superior, the integrated console is brilliant, the Django intellisence is on point...and on and on... there are so many little time-savers that it's worth the upfront cost of learning curve -- and loading time. 
Eh, I use Brackets.
&gt; real world experience "real world experience" is a bit vague, given the wide variety of areas that Python can be used in. Employers want to see what problems you have solved that are related to what they want solved (in general). So, taking an internship in data science will not help you get a job in dev-ops or vice versa. You stated: &gt; He is talking about artificial intelligence , machine learning and some amazing stuff and i realized i had to learn python to enter this world. so it sounds like you should take a "Python for AI" or "ML" course.
Find a library, and build a project around it.
You will probably have more "OMG - *that's* what I need to do..." coding thoughts walking him than you can imagine. So that's a win-win :-) [Here's a great book](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning) about why that might be the case (no affiliate link, I just liked the book)
no idea just Google flask tutorial and find something you like 
Not code related, but I see some Sturgill Simpson in that Spotify playlist. Hell yeah.
If I need to learn a new language I start with Derek Banas. His videos can be found on YouTube. The "Python Programming" video covers all of the basics. 
no offence but this reads as "I don't like learning programming languages", maybe you should rethink your career. Python also has a lot of frameworks, especially if you venture into data science. If you want to learn data science brush up on statistics and pick up a couple of courses on machine learning. But be aware, chances of getting hired with only knowing python are slim. 
This should be exactly what you need. 1. https://geo-python.github.io/2018/index.html Then take 2. https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/# Hope that helps
I think PyQt5 is pretty easy Example: https://youtu.be/ksW59gYEl6Q I would go with tkinter for a simple cross platform GUI
The only Python book I've read so far is LPtHW, and while I enjoyed it and got a lot out of it, I get the impression that it's really for complete beginners. That was me. If you had some experience already, you could easily finish it in a week, or possibly skip it for something a little more challenging. &amp;#x200B; You can skim the chapter titles and descriptions here for free to see if it's worth it. &amp;#x200B; [https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
How do you not lose interest? I learned the basics of programming but eventually just lose interest and stop.
Check out PySide2. I use it in my application. It's a QT based GUI so it looks pretty decent and is well maintained. 
It shouldn’t be tricky... use a virtualenv and a requirements.txt file or use pipenv (my current preference).
It's my daily driver as a Python web dev.
There isn't a single optimal path. Different people learn best in different ways. So you're going to get a lot of personal recommendations with no absolute answer. Either way, you'll have to start out with mastering all the basic concepts. That means (1) understanding the concepts, and (2) using them enough that you *really* get each concept. My personal recommendation for a way to master the basics is [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/) since it's much more practical than videos.
That's super cool. Sounds very practical. It reminds me of [this](https://pythonprinciples.com/) site, except automate the boring stuff sounds way more advanced.
I don't know R, and I have a superficial knowledge of Python, but as far I as know python has libraries for everything you need, making it easy to use ml libraries in any application. Can you use R to create a website/desktop application? 
OP I'd recommend [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/), it's an interactive tutorial that, unlike videos, gets you writing a bunch of code right away.
Or...wait for it...you're wrong and R *isn't* clearly better than Python.
OP I'd recommend [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/), it's an interactive tutorial that, unlike videos, gets you writing a bunch of code right away.
Great explanation. There's also some good explanations of lists (and other fundamentals) over at [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/)
To what?
Uh, yes.
if you were posting in a data sciences sub then this'd be a valid question. obviously you've strong feelings about language suitability for one narrow use case. maybe when you've delivered a bunch of production environments across a variety of platforms and problem sets you can come back and explain how R was better. or not. 
I also use Anaconda (well miniconda, but similar tool), so I generally agree with u/hharison here. A few more specific things that might be useful: * Place all pip package dependencies in your setup file (install_requires). Then, if you have no other dependencies (e.g., non-pip packages), you can either a) directly install from git using pip install git+&lt;git_url&gt; or b) do a git clone and then install editable using pip install -e . * Install nothing in your base environment if possible. Create environments for all projects so you know you can clean install using the same setup script on a new machine. I personally make bash scripts/bat files for my projects that set up my environment and install my package and dependencies. Feel free to ask more questions. I'm not an expert, but I'll share what I know.
I'd also recommend [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/) as a supplement to OP's course, for learning the basics of Python programming.
I'm intrigued by why you think R is miles better. I have reasonable experience with both R and python. (I have far more R experience as I started there) Personally whilst I prefer R for certain things (dplyr and the rest of the tidyverse is a God send, no idea how I managed before they were around) I wouldn't say it is better at everything I need to do (hence why I added python to my repertoire). for me sklearn is better than the R alternatives. Whilst there might be more diversity in the 13000 packages on CRAN, the consistency and structure of sklearn make it a joy, pipelines, custom estimators and transformers are great. I know there is R caret and I like this too and some of the more recent rstudio modelling data science stuff but sklearn just feels nicer to me. Granted shiny is a massive plus for R. The speed at which you can go from nothing to fairly complex webapp is incredible, and with futures/promises it's more scalable than ever. But for anything outside of the single page app life becomes hard in R, especially if you don't want to learn any other webdev stuff. Whereas python has tons of things. (Granted for most you still likely want to know some HTML CSS JS). Python does have dash, bokeh and flexx though which aren't terrible. when it comes to deep learning I think it's fairly clear that python is ahead. Yes there are R wrappers of things like keras and tensorflow, but they are never quite as up to date as the python version. Plus what if I want pytorch? (Does anyone know if there is an R interface to this?). Rmarkdown it's hard to give to R now since you can run a python engine just as easily and it requires no knowledge of R to do so. So parameterised reproducible reports,docs and presentations goes to both really. R having dataframes as a base object is great, but numpy arrays and pandas are hardly unpopular amongst other datascience libraries. I would agree that R has a better "feel" for manipulating data frames, and in lots of cases gets you from nothing to model faster than python, but python just has such a wider range of applications that let you slot in to all the other things that a data driven company might want to do that much more easily. I think both have their strengths (why I wanted to know both) and both have their place for now. Plus we can call one from the other in both directions so it really feels handy to leverage the strength of each. genuinely intrigued as to whether I'm missing something as to why python Is inferior. I genuinely wouldn't want to waste time learning more stuff if there was good reason not to. 
Cool bait post, bro.
OP I'd recommend [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/) for learning the basics of Python programming.
You don't need a fancy laptop. You can even program in Python on a phone (via an online site). For example see [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/) for learning the basics of Python programming.
There are multiple ways to do this; here's one: Set up a server in Python that can send and receive data serialized as strings (Django Rest Framework is great for this). Use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to send and receive data with the server.
Have to agree, I love VSCode and use it for a lot of things, but once you have Pycharm setup properly, the little things like integrated terminal and console (both multi tab), the watchers, the debugging tools, built-in flask support... JetBrains have me by the balls. Plus if you tried to take DataGrip away from me and make me use pgadmin I'd scratch your eyes right out.
You can also do it in C++, that means C++ is better.
C++ IS BETTER
Thanks for your reply. I do acknowledge you can parse data into serialized strings but how would you go about outputting this data into something neater ? Like a table ? I’m assuming you would use css ? 
In fairness, the website thing I will grant you, surprisingly easy with the available tooling. But desktop app? I'm not aware of anything great here ( I may be wrong). But short of Rinno (windows only) to package a shiny app or forcing some sort of horrible electron, R type thing together im not sure of desktop app creation in R. 
We should move forward at any cost. It's called evolution.
So again. It serves to and IDE not to CPU, right?
Well, thanks for mentioning, I've added MIT (the only piece what I've pasted (miller-rabin), was under MIT in P. Norvig's Pytudes).
I will check that out. Thank you !
You could have stopped with 'I don't know R' and saved yourself a bunch of embarrassment. Yes, Python has libraries that can almost approximate the functionality of base R. 
You could enter a Toyota Camry in the Indy 500, but that doesn't make a Camry a better race car.
Mine was a question. Seems like you too could have deleted the post viewing other comments. 
Your data science or automation project is a nail. Python and R are your hammers. Choose your tool and get your job done. 
Yes: [css-grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
Finally, a knowledgeable response. But, honestly, sklearn doesn't have the breadth or depth of base R. There's tons of things I take for granted when using R that a combination of numpy, pandas, and sklearn just can't match. IMO Python developers should just content themselves with writing cute little web games while R developers do real data work.
Become a package maintainer for it then.

Love it. I use Spyder for my day-to-day work, i.e. data analysis and prototyping stuff, simply because the variable viewer is so damn handy. But for everything bigger than that and cleaning up my mess, VSCode is friggin awesome. 
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking... your setup.py can include information about your own C extensions (using distutils.core.Extension) and build those extensions as required. You can also include libraries your extension is dependent on in that, though I'm unclear what you mean by "mount" here. Also using Cython doesn't necessarily add additional C dependencies, you can accomplish a great deal with just the Cython extensions to Python.
You're close, keep going
What do you want to make?
Its not really that, its that I want to become fluent in writing any program because, why not?
Lol html is not a programming language, get lost noob
You need a goal. A project. You can read books about being a car mechanic and change a tire a bunch of times but that doesn’t help you actually fix a car.
Ah yes, in that sense I want to make a program to solve a Rubik's cube. I know there are already apps out there that can do it, and I know that Python isn't the only thing that I'll need to use, but I think I have a better way of doing it.
The other guy is right HTML is not a programming language. HTML and CSS are mark-up languages. But you picked a good language to start with. Also that example just shows you kinda know what variables are its not exactly a program. but hey at least your learning.
[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) is a great library for dealing with networks. People would be nodes, and their relationships would be edges between the people. Nodes and edges can have arbitrary values, so you could say `edge_type='friend', edge_weight=4`, or something like that. I didn't use Python at the time, but I made a visualization of the Skyrim social network with data I pulled out of its modding tools: http://rcfox.ca/Skyrim-NPC-Relationship-Parser/
Thats not how software works or how evolution works.

[Here](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/stem-books) is the direct link to the STEM Book Bundle on Humble Bundle. I bought it, and it seems pretty decent so far.
thanks!
OP’s link is to a twitter account which links to a blog which links to humble bundle. Just FYI. 
I'm very new to coding, is that a good book for beginners? If so, could you post the link? 
You start in the sidebar over there ====&gt; (aka, /r/learnpython
Good stuff! Thanks for sharing!
Anyone else think it’s weird the picture on the book is of a rodent, not a python?
Yeah same, Spyder for data science, VS Code for all other coding.
All depends on you location. If your in a big city finding Python jobs shouldn't be hard. Python is one of the most popular and fastest grow languages. Python can be used for so much more then PHP. I think you'll be OK. I wouldn't ditch PHP all together you may find some site jobs that need PHP help.
Might I suggest creating an account on github or gitlabs and hosting the code there? While I can appreciate your providing a shareable link to your google drive, code is much more likely to be pursued/commented on/downloaded if its in a location where its more accessible and reviewable.
Turtles all the way down brother

I've always found xml to be quite painful to deal with in python, but there are several packages on pypi which makes dealing with rss/podcast feeds easier, could be worth looking into. Good luck!
why the unnecessary sarcasm? The last sentence doesn’t add anything to your argument.
Working on (learning to) implementing dependency injection in python-based rest apis using [https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Injector/](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Injector/). Very nice stuff.
Share it on github, compile with pyinstaller, cx_freeze or py2exe (I think this is still a thing). I personally use pyinstaller.
Good Ritual, dude!
Yeah, that's the always hardest part when you learn programming language. Finding a project you can do.

Since you always have 100 events showing up, maybe that's something you can utilize: say that at most you'll get 5 identical messages in a row between each where there's either a timestamp or description that gives it uniqueness. If that's the case, you could construct a hash of the "current" + 5-10 older messages. Probability of uniqueness would then be high, as long as you consider enough "older" events. This would also have the added bonus of being idempotent - the hash would be the same given the same sequence of events. &amp;#x200B; A possible caveat would that the first n events (event 95-100) won't have enough "older than" events to allow you to construct a hash, but if the list of 100 events is a rolling one, and you refresh the set often enough to avoid getting a completely refreshed set that might not be a problem. &amp;#x200B; Just a thought.
Based on what you said I don't think a GUI is nessacarily needed. I think you should look at the CMD module
Glad you mentioned it! I purchased the ebook, and just went through chapter one. I’m glad to hear it gets more complex, either way this the perfect interlude of code practice I need (to keep honing python skills) as I bust my brain on Django! What is your goal with coding? You seem to have accomplished quite a bit of learning gauging by your posts; congrats!

You might not know everything thats "required" on there now, but keep at it and for sure you will. You never know what will happen and what random opportunities will come your way. Just don't give up man. I almost did and I randomly got really lucky, got a job working at a video game company. Always try to remember all the cool shit you will be able to do in the near future. I'm starting to learn python myself in order to make games and AI in the future, as well as I want to automate the boring stuff. Always try to feed your mind. Programming is great for that, and if you really like doing it than all the better.
I think they have windows releases, check the github page. https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases
For currency, you need to use something like the decimal library or integers. Standard floating point has precision errors. You probably know this from Excel. You might wish to use a money class that stores the amount and the currency, so that you don't have to keep converting it everywhere you use it. There's probably some government regulations you have to comply with for financial software. You probably know this already.
&gt;But the fact that i had to learn so many new frameworks just made me stop.and apparently there is a new frame work every 6 months and i felt that i can't keep up with that. Seriously? Boohoo... learning frameworks and languages is part of being a developer. &gt;.then i realized i hate java and swift and didn't want to get a job as a mobile dev. so basically i wasted 3 months on a tech that i hate now. Why is this a waste? Neither Java nor Swift are restricted to mobile development. Each language has their strengths and weaknesses. Increasing your knowledge of all things related to development is one of the most important things you can do as a developer. &gt;after these experiences now i know i don't like JavaScript and I hate Java and Swift and the slow and pathetic android studio and xcode which i had to suffer these three months. Suffer? So you basically copied and pasted code, didn't know what you were doing, and now you hate Java and Swift and are qualified to call the development environments slow and pathetic? &gt;...data structures and algorithms.they didn't teach that in bootcamp and i really want to apply for this internship. No-one is going to spoon feed you this shit. Do a Google search for data structures and algorithms or pick up a book and learn. Or pay some money and take some courses. This is one of the few engineering careers where you can get in the door without going to college or university–but don't be mistaken, it's not easy to master. It takes A LOT of research and work. That's why companies ask for experience in data structures and algorithms–it filters out the ones who think that they do an online course or two and presume to know it all. &amp;#x200B; Honestly, your attitude towards development and this profession stinks and that would personally stop me from hiring you, much less choosing to work with you. There are gazillion courses online for Python development. Dream up a personal project and get working on it.
Thanks.

VSCode is worse than the free version of Pycharm, but it's quicker on slower machines. The one problem with Pycharm is type annotations, but who actually uses those? I tried, and I had to restructure my code because you need to import or forward declare to annotate, and it therefore required a huge refactoring to avoid a circular import that didn't exist before. Maybe if you started from scratch with annotations, you could design around it.
HTML+CSS combination is turing complete, which would make it a programming language when combined.
&gt; set up a conda environment for each project with an environment.yml You mean first manually create the .yml then "conda-env create" with it ?
I love automate the boring stuff. It's amazing what you can do with that book
I will too!!
I learnt programming in Python myself, it changed my life. I do it almost every day, because I like it so much. Well one downside, time flies incredibly fast when programming.
Well your advice to a newbie who is trying to find their way also stinks. there is nothing wrong to discover that you don't like a programming language and basically with the introduction of Flutter and Dart, it's pointless to learn 2 different languages for native development and restrict yourself to java for android and swift for ios. you can write once with Dart and run anywhere. and for the python part and data structures and algorithms I'm going to do the course i mentioned. I know nobody will spoon feed me.just asked for advice.
Some say yes, some say no. To each there own i guess. I was always taught they weren't. You can't really make any usable "program" with them. A webpage would be the only thing. That's why people use JavaScript,PHP,Python ect. To program actions. 
thanks. I'm learning the basics now.hopefully will do that.
I'd back Tkinter as a good first GUI framework to learn. It's relatively simple, there are lots of resources out there, and it's generally going to be available as an option without any extra installation.
Docker.
It's not debatable. The combination has been proven turing complete. A bit of google work will verify this. Implementing a version of the Python interpreter as a cellular automata in html+css would of course be very slow and use much memory, but it's theoretically possible. You'd be limited by the browser sandbox too.
atom is better than both imo
Thinking about buying this book. I could order the 1st edition no problem. The 5th and newest I would have to order from amazon.com, costing me more money. Is the fifth edition much better than the first?
My advice is just fine. 25 years in this career, with at least 20 being active in hiring newbies tells me that your attitude is not something that I would even look at twice. So take it or leave it... I don't care. I have a career. Flutter and Dart can never replace pure native development. At some point you're going to want to do something in either iOS or Android that Flutter and Dart can not do. How far do you think you'll get if you never embrace native development in iOS or Android technologies? I saw that you asked the exact same question on cscareeradvice. The (very astute) response there was to compare it to a carpenter not wanting to use flat-head screws. You simply can't have that attitude in this profession. I do wish you well, but please be more positive about learning technologies you may not, at the face of it, enjoy.
I care
so very much this
You might find a job with a company that is slowly transitioning from PHP to Python, as my company is. We have a solid PHP codebase which isn't going away. But PHP programmers are being encouraged to learn Python and given intro-level tasks to help them transition. &gt; Assuming I learn Python from tutorials and such, How hard would it be hard to find a job as a Python developer without any Py experience? I'll be honest, I probably would not give you a call. Python has a "pythonic way of thinking" which takes some time to absorb. We've hired Java programmers who had done Python tutorials, and they ended up writing Java in Python, much of which has since been replaced.

Love the book!
Hydrogen is pretty much key to make atom very good with python. The only thing with Hydrogen is that the export to Jupyter notebook isn't very good (I use Jupytext to convert my .py scripts to notebooks). 
Your functions need to return stuff. Also is error_m defined anywhere?
Your function isn’t returning anything and when you fix that, it needs to update the state of hrs hrs = compute_hours(hrs) After the try, Return float(hrs) and after the except, Return -1 Sorry I’m on mobile so my typing sucks 
In-built terminal as well so no need to switch to terminal to run your code
You could make hrs a global variable, which would affect the original instantiation of hrs but I don’t think that’s pythonic. You should learn that variables inside of functions are independent of variables outside no matter the name, unless of course you make it a global variable 
Yup, missing `return`, or maybe you meant `print(float(hrs))`. Unlike in the interactive mode, normal python doesn't automatically output anything without `print`. But also, the error handling is broken, once `hrs` becomes `-1`, it never gets unset, and just keep trying over and over again, without asking the user for new input.
How do I make a global variable? &amp;#x200B;
well like Steve jobs said in one of his conferences "You can't make everyone happy." and perhaps there is a reason why google introduced flutter,maybe it will eradicate the use of java as we know it. I don't know but i still prefer it. yes i try to get all the advice i can and some people are negative and some are positive. I try to be positive and learn what i enjoy because that's what keeps me motivated in doing the projects. I wish you luck as well.

/r/learnpython You could store each appointment in the database, and have a stand alone process / thread that checks the appointments each day to notify those with an appointment coming up. 
You can guard imports with if typing.TYPE_CHECKING: from some_module_only_used_for_types import Type1, Type2 
Put global hrs as the first line in your function 
/r/learnpython
/r/python is for Python news and announcements, so this question is likely to not be answered here. I would suggest that you ask language questions on /r/learnpython but this is also not a Python related question. One of the first steps in becoming an intermediate programmer is learning that the language is simply a tool and does not define design decisions as much as one might think. This question has nothing to do with Python, and everything to do with *design*. My first suggestion would be to try things out and design a solution from the ground up. And from there, optimize your solution to best solve the problem at hand. If you think your problem is best solved using a data structure or algorithm, then feel free to search PyPi for a relevant library.
Which is the best python book to start as bigener?
Awesome. Great way to learn to code as you can see and feel the benefits.
That actually makes it work. Thanks.
What about FORTRAN? It is good for math and matrix manipulation.
I don’t know man I only use sublime text as my editor 
Dam that’s looks good
Your functions are executing but hrs is being shadowed by local scope.
Happy to help! &amp;#x200B; I kinda figured you were using a Flask server, good to know that you're following guidelines and best practices. There are some cases where you can get away with it, but you may indeed have troubles down the line if you plan to use and build upon the app for a long time. &amp;#x200B; And as someone suggested, the `json` module is a much better alternative to `pickle`. The file you output is readable (rather than random strings of unicode) and might be useful for when you need to any debugging or testing before production. Just replace all instances of "pickle" in the code I wrote earlier with "json". They are both part of the Python standard library and their functions are mostly the same.
Sure... but pycharm had that too so its not really a distinguishing feature. 
Python *then* C++ would be a lot easier, but you do you :-)
Does he cover XML? Trying to get an XML file into pandas and it’s distinctively not fun.
&gt; I need to actually select from the dropdown menu that appears (I cannot hit tab or hit enter or such) and I am not sure if selenium is able to do that I'm pretty sure selenium can do this. However, selenium in general is pretty gross. Pyppeteer is the only alternative I know of, although it can only drive chromium and chrome, you may have more luck with that.
I have hundreds of web forms to fill and I would rather not fill it out 1 by 1 (as I had done the other week)...do you have ideas on what alternatives might exist otherwise, even outside of python? ill check out pypp
Interesting note with the “pythonic way of thinking”.
It's actually for anyone who just wants to automate the boring stuff, even those who know nothing about Python, or coding in general. The author has the entire book for free, and even made video tutorials of select chapters and put them on YouTube. You should check it out, if you're curious. He's a great dude.
I wrote this several years ago. It's in VBA and kinda old but maybe it'll help out: https://github.com/scoobydont/IEAutoWithExcel
Finally, someone else mentions Spyder. I definitely prefer it for initial project setups -- dealing with single scripts or data analysis. Static code analysis feature is enjoyable. I love the window variations that make it resemble MatLab and Rstudio.
There are a bunch of webdrivers in javascript (certainly pyppeteer, and I think selenium-python too, just wraps a JS library). None are as mature as selenium.
Thanks! I decided to go back to college (even though you don't need to for CS, I had been smart enough to save up after working for the past five years). My goal is to get into the ML field, which definitely requires quite a bit of previous work and experience in the field if you want to be taken seriously. So I figured, while I learn, keep making /whatever/, as long as it's something, so I can make more complex things and put them on a resume when I'm ready to get a job in the field. I've found coding to be much easier if you just constantly practice.
fo real? can you explain why
I use Spyder for competitions and anything other than big projects. I wish someone took Spyder and just added decent venv support to it and it'd be perfect. The thing runs so smoothly compared to basically anything else. Can't stand Pycharm and there's no decent alternatives 
Literally neovim has this, this isn't a factor for anyone with a half decent editor.
I use this, it works well https://youtu.be/OZSZHmWSOeM
Oof, unfortunately not. I'd help out, but I'm not that familiar with XML. That's the particular reason you're using XML? From what I understand, XML is the soyboy equivalent to Chad JSON, isn't it?
It's not significantly different. You can still use virtualenv just fine. I dev primarily on a macbook pro but my home desktop is windows. The only difference I'm aware of from my comment above is how you activate, and it's just `.\env\Scripts\activate`. 
This is awesome! Thanks for taking the time.
wow. gold!
You may not need to actually make a selection. Interact with the web page in your browser with the developer tools installed and the network tab open. Listed there will be the requests, headers and contents that your browser sent and using that info you can recreate those requests in a program. Here is an example, look for the ones using `requests.post`. http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests 
I’ve been working on learning python for a while now (slowly) and I still find myself using ; or declaring variables occasionally. It’s a hard habit to shake. 
Working my way through the Rosalind bioinformatics problems. 
It's good Pycharm has better suggestions though, but you can do everything just fine in Vscode
I'm a big fan of Azure, and am in the process of deploying a /r/WagtailCMS app to it and thought others might find this helpful. NOTE: You can get a free $150 Azure monthly credits if you are a student via [Microsoft Imagine](https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us). You can also get $200 towards Azure for free [if you own a business or startup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/startups/?ref=MS4SU) (including sole proprietorships) and 12-months of free services like Linux VMs. 
I had a subscription to safari books online. I’ve used their resources for C# and python for automation and data science related projects. I don’t think I would have been successful without their resources. They also have an A-Z resource to building a web app in Flask which I followed a few months ago. I like their books.
i had something like this, the code runner plugin uses a different setting in the settings file for where you want to look for the python install, though if it is in your path it should work. i would honestly try uninstalling (or disable) the code runner plugin and see if you can get it working that way first. i found it really confusing. what i found easier was binding a hotkey(s) to execute in terminal, though again i would just see if you can get right clicking -&gt; run in terminal (i dont have it in front of me so phrase might be slightly different) working.
Another recommendation for networkx, when it comes to storing and querying the relationships. Your actual problem is probably represented most closely by an expert system (e.g. the libraries pyknow and pyke) but that gets really complicated pretty fast.
Love it!
The above comments are great. I would only add pyenv to the virtualenv management you choose. 
Tracking existence and growth of connected components in a graph as vertices and edges are added. Performing a breadth fist search with every change is wasteful, so components are merged with every new edge. The thing that tripped me up was an efficient way to know if the edge connected two vertices in the same connected component or not. It's forcing me to remember a lot I'd forgotten from discrete math, some thirty years ago.
Nice
Just a general question, why use urllib over requests? And in what scenarios would you?
Many people report that they like it particularly because it's so lightweight (unlike Pycharm..) However, after installing the Python and possibly the IntelliCode Extensions, VS Code seems to take up more resources than Pycharm, at least on my machine (Win10, fresh VS Code installation, everything up to date, both stable build and insider version tested) Is this just me?
Honestly, my level of knowledge is that of parroting other peopl[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2018026/what-are-the-differences-between-the-urllib-urllib2-and-requests-module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2018026/what-are-the-differences-between-the-urllib-urllib2-and-requests-module)e: I just haven't had experience with both enough to feel comfortable claiming my use case most appropriately matches my choice.
Thanks! I’ll check it out

Since data a logic is already in Excel sheets, any Python code will be taking input from, and writing output to, them. There exists a standard module [csv](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html#module-csv), so read that doc file carefully, and look up any related concepts like OrderedDict until you get what they are doing. The multi-step workflow, .xls -&gt; CSV -&gt; Python code -&gt; CSV -&gt; xls could get tedious. I think there is no standard library module supporting direct xls I/O, but there are some contributed modules in [pypi](https://pypi.org/search/?q=xls) that might be useful. When dealing with contributed modules you have to be choosy. Some are brilliantly written and documented, many are... not. But it being Python you can always read the code and see what they are doing, which is at least educational.
I use it and find it better than other tools at least.
Not OP, but TL;DR: Python is more beginner friendly.
Sorry, the more I think about this, the more I wish I were in the habit of thinking before replying. It's funny, for a work project I chose requests, I'm realizing, but the api I was working with was a bit cumbersome. I think if you have a quick one off request that is not complicated to form, then there's no reason to install an external library, which, if I'm not mistaken, requests is. But if you have heavier work that would benefit from the extra abstraction, go with requests. Plus, I love their cool hermetic logo.
Pretty cool. I might give it a try.
&gt; Easiest way to make a GUI? That's kind of a trick question. For example, if you're using PyGObject you can make a GUI with Glade. Or if you're using PySide2 you can make a GUI with QtDesigner. This are applications that let you create a GUI file by dragging and dropping widgets. You can, then, use that file/GUI in your program with python code. Which, imo, falls under the category of an easy way to make a GUI. As opposed to writing the GUI within the code of your program just with calls to the framework. Now, for each of those platforms you'll have to learn how the placing and organizing of widget works. And also how to make your python program use or interact with the GUI. So I guess, for whatever path you take, you're going to have to lean a bit.
Used to use Atom and I switched to VSCode, besides some odd things that I need to get used to like replace keys, I love it. I still use PyCharm for Django projects tho, but I love all the plugins I work with on VSCode as I do more than just Python so I find it very versatile and convenient.
It's different in how you install Python itself, and also on Linux it's usually much easier to compile dependencies that use Cython.
Virtualenwrapper is great for managing your virtualenvs https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
&gt;So, if I understand you correctly, using cubic hermite splines would basically be using them as a set of basis functions, and then searching for the right (linear?) combo of them? Bingo. Right now you're using a piecewise-linear basis. Hermite splines are simply a piecewise-cubic basis that guarantees C1 continuity. For smooth solutions, the higher order basis will get you a better approximation with fewer degrees of freedom. The smoothness guarantee should help prevent the genetic algorithm from wasting lots of trials on jagged candidates. &gt;I also wanted to try to avoid inserting any domain knowledge A good instinct, but IMO there's no problem with putting domain knowledge in the fitness function / objective function. Quite to opposite in fact. Obviously, you want to keep to optimizer general, so the optimizer shouldn't know that the state variables represent a Hermite spline. But the objective function is precisely where you define the mapping from states to fitness: the more a-priori knowledge you can cram in there (and into any constraint functions) the easier/faster it will be to solve the optimization problem. &gt;I think it should be correct within the approximation of a series of incline planes Thanks for explaining what you did; I agree that should work and will probably be more accurate than my approach for really coarse approximations. However, I suspect the two methods should perform similarly as you increase the segment count (same formal order of accuracy, if you're familiar with that). You're right at the doorstep of a really interesting field (trajectory/shape optimization). If you're interested in pursuing this further, a good course on [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) should be on your to-do list.
**Numerical analysis** Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century also the life sciences, social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. As an aspect of mathematics and computer science that generates, analyzes, and implements algorithms, the growth in power and the revolution in computing has raised the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering, and complex numerical analysis is required to provide solutions to these more involved models of the world. Ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics (planets, stars and galaxies); numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Django is great to get a project up and running with a customizable admin interface if you don't have much experience in creating a frontend
Nice. I like this a lot. 
I was not aware of VBA applications before reading this post but after some light reading, it looks very interesting. I’ll include that is the options, thank you! 
Thank for the warning. I’ll def have a look into the Module cvs! 
I’ve read a lot of posts referencing Django. I’ve added to the list! Thanks 
Though I am a python lover and automating finance applications using robot framework, If your day to day tasks involve reading and writing data from and to excel sheets and manipulations,for beginners RPA tool like UiPath is a good start. You can automate your day to day tasks in no time. Academy.Uipath.com is a good resource. 
I love it. The pycharm keymap extension is great if you use pycharm and want to try it without the learning curve.
I started in PHP and transitioned into primarily Python. I've also transitioned from development to operations however, so more YMMV than normal. There will be some adjustment, but it should not be too bad if you're writing reasonably modern and clean PHP. If you're doing inline code mixed with html on every page then you're going to have to get used to the ideas of MVC and such. The only major difference in how you'd approach things is that Python is not used in a shared nothing architecture like PHP is, which means a) you need to be a little more careful about state persistence bugs and b) you can cheat a lot by loading up the framework and other initialization once on server start instead of every request. &gt; How hard would it be hard to find a job as a Python developer without any Py experience? Don't look for Python jobs. Look for web development jobs (what you already do) that happen to use Python. Most of the time you're only going to meet half to three quarters of the desired requirements for a job, and in this case one of them is experience with the programming language they use. It's just like getting a job that uses Postgres when you only have experience with MySQL, or RedHat when you know Ubuntu. &gt; Also, would that mean I would essentially be a “junior” programmer and have to take a pay cut to start fresh and at the lowest level ? No, most of the skills of a senior engineer don't have to do with tools knowledge.
Nice, do you have a gitlab as well or are you staying on github?
you should x-post to r/etymology
Excel is just our current way of doing things... do you think removing excel for workings and using python end to end would be a better long term solution - if at all possible? The reason I thought of learning python was to apply it to different areas and for the long term. 
Seems awesome! Just a heads up that instead of `not a == b` you should use `a != b`
Stackoverflow, patience, and persistence!
Sendtex's Tkinter tutorial videos came in handy too.
Why "if running" though?
Don't have a computer on me, so I can't make sure my critiques absolutely work before suggesting them, but here it goes: The while True: x=input blocks could be reduced to 2 lines each, if you are insistent on doing it like this- while(input('') != ''): pass All the while loops I just mentioned belong in a function that you call. If you are writing the same several lines more than once, it belongs in a function that you call. The 'if running' should be in a function called gameloop, and the while running and if running statements should be taken out. This removes the running variable altogether, and will make it much more readable. These are just my thoughts right now for improvement. Definitely keep going!
Cool! 
It will show up if you pass a the `help` kwarg to `SwitchAttr`.
Thanks Man
Currently I am designing and writing a digital inventory management application for my company using python and MSSQl, with the addition of a request and delivery system built within it.
/r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; You could store your grades in a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database). I'd say the easiest to get started is [MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mysql_getstarted.asp), or [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
&gt; I consider class-based views to be a non-negotiable feature for anything that would be used in a larger/long-term project. Why though? Is it just a way to organize your code, or do you make use of something that can only be done with classes?
nice, a picture of the terminal in README helps 👍
that gives lots of ideas for cli apps
definitely py goes muscular
For permanent storage you will need to add those values to a database for storage, which means something like [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) will be what you are looking for. It's pretty easy to get started with, and also very useful, but if you are just looking for something quick and easy you could always use the [google sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python) which will basically do the same thing, but is less secure and not as practical as MySQL.
please, update the readme, this is an awesome project which looks desolate 
nice suggestions
Cool thank you.
It is incomplete It stops unexpectedly when it actually starts doing the comparison and the specifics on this study case. So it ends up being a lot of introduction and very fewv actual content
git, HTML, PHP etc are all scripting language. That's why I said if that count's.
There are many potential storage options, the best depends entirely on your data, its structure (if any), how you want to interact with it, and how you want to persist it. The simplest option is a local file; if you've just got a single value (like a running average) you can simply write that as the only value in a file, then read and parse it on the next use. That's prone to error, though, so there's things like **pickle** and **shelve** to persist objects to disk and load them again. Those have security risks though, so there's structured file formats like **csv** and **json**. Those can't be safely written and read by multiple processes though, which is why **sqlite3** exists. And only once you've exhausted all of those do you start looking for databases in separate processes like MySQL.
Because people might want to actually deploy a solution to production and not let it sit in R?
Sure, will add that in a bit. Thanks
Python will require you to learn programming concepts. C++ will *also* require you to learn a great deal of detail about C++ and the ecosystem. So learning Python will be mostly transferable learning, while C++ is only partly transferable. And Python was literally created to be easy to teach and learn!
Favourable. 
HI, I use [ViduPM](https://vidupm.com/)a great tool for every project. 
I disagree, I thought it was succinct but it was a complete thought. It wasn't a full academic paper by any means, but the content is still useful.
Great job! I'd suggest reading about defining functions, it'll really help you to reduce the amount of copy pasting in the future. https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp

Is `bs4` a built-in? If not, you're missing a `pip3 install something` in your install instructions.
I figured OP wanted to use built-ins only but then I saw `bs4`, so I don't know anymore.
Pipenv for sure
Pyinstaller makes exes. You don’t need a separate program as a user.
Actually this bool condition should be rewritten in &amp;nbsp; `a == b or a == c` &amp;nbsp; if he doesn't know about `in` operator. 
Thanks! &amp;#x200B;
It means together, to iterate over two lists together/simultaneously
That's what I use. I use a lot of C++ and HTML along with python and I want everything in one place.
For web, try Dash by Plotly
If a post doesn't belong, commenting on that post beyond letting the OP know that it's off topic, is just as off topic. 
Bs4 is BeautifulSoup, which he does say is a requirement
Pretty cool project :D Thanks for sharing
You may try [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) It lets you share essentially the full development environment, i.e. both the source code editor and the related Python session, a Python application running in a console, or a web apppplication developed with Python. You can also invite others to help you or collaborate to the development.
The Python here is pretty straightforward and could almost certainly be improved and optimized, but it was my first time deploying a web-app via AWS Lambda so thought this may be a useful write-up for anyone else looking to do the same
Thanks for your kind words. Nostalgia got me as I remembered we were doing something similar with GWBASIC in high school.

&gt; Is it a standard one? No. There aren't any standards for organizing your projects. It isn't very common either. It is not very common to name your sources directory `src`, usually it is the name of the package you are working on. `src` is more common in other languages, in Python it is usually an indication that the person working on the project came from something like Java. `data` directory due to all kinds of problems with Python packaging usually goes under `src` (or what would have been your project's sources directory). This is not ideal, but the layout you show is even less so. Depending on what your data are, another name may be given to the folder, perhaps `etc` (more in line with `src`), perhaps something else, more indicative of its purpose. `test` or `tests` are pretty common and, indeed usually go into the top-level of your project, though some people prefer to keep tests together with the source code so that they stay close to the modules they are supposed to test. But, the way you show it is more common, it is also where `setuptools` would look for the tests for your package. `docs`, similar to the tests may or may not be in top-level. The problem here is that if you are using Sphinx to generate the documentation, by default, it expects the documentation source directory and the output directory to be under your code source directory, but a lot of people configure it in such a way that the output directory goes into top-level.
Gitlab
You should format your code so that it looks proper: \\\`\\\`\\\` pip install test \\\`\\\`\\\` looks like \`\`\` pip install test \`\`\`
:)
this is pretty cool 
The decision on what language to use is primarily a popularity contest. All other qualities need to be only on "acceptable" level. Python is popular, and this fact scores it even more points in popularity. If I could choose what language to make more popular for data science project, I'd be choosing between R and Julia. I wouldn't even think of Python as a contender. But, I cannot choose what is popular, so I have to live with the fact, that Python is.
Yea it reminds me of using OpenGL to call windows and displaying pixels. Unrelated sort of but the code's quite nice :)
This question is better suited for /r/learnpython

This question is better suited to https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython I'd ask over there instead.
My Google drive is mounted to the system so I just treat it like a part of the filesystem and use cp, mv, rsync etc
&gt; What is the definition of async to you? Not of "async", of "asynchronous I/O". Your language doesn't do I/O. Your system does. Your language's library may have some means of talking to your system to ask it to do I/O. So, there are two players in this game: one that actually does I/O (the system, by talking to device drivers, which, in turn, talk to device's firmware), and your language's runtime. Now, what does it mean to do I/O asynchronously? -- It means that at any point in this chain of calls nothing blocks. I.e. your language runtime isn't blocked on a system call, the system call isn't blocked on a call to driver, the driver isn't blocked on a call to firmware. How is this achieved? -- Interrupts. Your device's firmware has a way to send interrupts to your system, and the system is also able to interrupt your program to notify it about the changed state of I/O. Since I/O performed in such a way necessary has two components: request and response neither one of these should block. There are different schemes of doing something "like asynchronous I/O": 1. Threaded I/O: you start a new thread that performs blocking system call for I/O. But, your application may continue while the thread blocks on system call and blocks on reading out the result of the system call. 2. Polling I/O: you make a non-blocking system call to perform an I/O and then block on reading the response (possibly in a different thread). 3. Asynchronous I/O: you make non-blocking system call and the system calls you back when it's done processing your request. 4. A variation of polling: when you are blocked on a blocking system call, but your blocking code can execute some other code while it blocks (i.e. it has a busy wait loop, where at each iteration, if the condition isn't met, it will do some other, unrelated work). Python's "asynchronous I/O" is the #4 on this list. I.e. it's a lame attempt at best. A kind of easy to make patch to masquerade the real problem. &gt; Why don't you rewrite it then? Because I don't like Python in general? Because I have better things to do with my time? Because I don't need to solve this problem in Python: I can use other runtimes which did solve the problem already? There are plenty of reasons... Most of them would be obvious if you spent a minute thinking about them. &gt; So Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Instagram, etc. are all idiots By the very nature, big companies cannot be staffed by the best programmers: it is neither physically possible (there just aren't that many good programmers), nor is it financially viable: it would be paying too much for the products that don't generate that much revenue. Their goals are not to produce the highest quality products, but to produce the products that generate the highest revenue. I bet you something like Honda or Mazda cars produce better revenue than Rolls Royce, even though the latter is much higher quality. Similarly, Microsoft's Python code is of abysmal quality, but it "sort of works" for what they need it to work. But whether they use `mypy` or not is by no means an indication of the quality of this package one way or another.
Yes that is also one of the ways in which it can be drive can be used, this is an alternative approach to that rather than mounting the entire drive we keep only the part that is required remove that part when not required. A makeshift type of that
I picked VS Code because I'm learning. It's free so no issues installing it on a work machine too. For new people struggling with it, install the python extensions it prompts you too but also install settings sync (to sync your settings to Github so you can pull them to any machine), this will be very helpful if you really start to tailor it with shortcuts, etc. Also install Code Runner. VS Code runs the code through a debugger by default which can slow things down especially if you're writing quick lines starting out. Code runner let's you run code with ctrl+alt+n and it works instantly. 
Thanks for your response. I learned a lot. So it seems that the article was perhaps a bit over-stating it. One more question... does 'source' have a special meaning? What distinguishes 'source code' from generic code?

`jupyter kernelspec uninstall &lt;whatever&gt;` or `remove` (I assume it's the same for ipython). Note that `jutpyter --help` would have told you that.
You should always think twice about introducing dependencies. Dependencies increase the attack vector, dependencies need to be kept up-to-date, fetching dependencies slows down build time. In OP's scenario there is no significant advantage of using requests, so why introduce a dependency? You could argue that OP already uses another dependency, so one more doesn't really hurt but by this logic things will accumulate and managing this stuff will become a pain and you might even end up in JS-ecosystem-like disasters.

As the ransomware would encrypt the entire filesystem, it might also encrypt the mounted drive
Ya, so in that case I guess this product proves a better alternative than directly mounting the the drive

Sorry for my complete ignorance, but I don't know how to do that. 
Let's say the run.py file is on the desktop. 1. Press windows key + r 2. type 'cmd' then enter 3. type 'cd Desktop' then enter 4. type 'python run.py'
I got another .py file going just by typing its name after step 3. But the same didn't work for the above code. I got the following message: &gt;File "C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\vampire.py", line 1 &gt; &gt;Python 3.7.2 (tags/v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 23 2018, 22:20:52) \[MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)\] on win32 &gt; &gt;\^ &gt; &gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax &amp;#x200B;
Thanks for answering the question! 
I googled and the first result was this https://spinbackup.com/blog/can-ransomware-infect-google-drive/

That worked, although I realise now that the code doesn't really do anything without openings for inputs. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for the help despite my ignorance! 
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) is my all-time favourite library and I use it *all the time.* Happy to answer any questions people have! Tests with Hypothesis are the only ones where I end up going "huh, I didn't know *that* could happen..." - for everything else, if I didn't think of it when writing the code I didn't think to test it either.
Awesome! It might be difficult to quantify but to what extent do you think it’s helped you discover edge cases? I guess I’m asking, what is the ROI? Thanks for taking the time to answer :)
Then just add inputs. name = input('Enter a name: ')
Look up documentation for tkinter keysym, it's saying you're giving onkey an unknown string.
I'm absolutely not an expert so I don't know for sure what I'm saying. Are you in Canada under a student visa? I thought I've heard in the past that generally students cannot work and be paid, that requires a work visa, and the student visa application process requires you to give financial information to show that you have the resources to complete your studies. Again, I don't know, but maybe you should check your visa restrictions just to be safe
I don't use any dependencies when writing small system scripts, that way when I clone my dotfiles, everything I need, I have.
The thing is that the cmd module quickly gets messy. Is there a way to “clean it” (erase all previous messages) and maybe make things look a little more pretty (some sort of layout)
Please ask questions of this kind in /r/learnpython 
I didn't know it existed, I'll do that in future, thank you.
Very nice, I'd like to fork it and adapt it to my own language
Got no problem with you disagreeing
I think it should be a while loop.
Thank you
I've never given Spyder a real shot. I just got so accustomed to jupyter notebooks that I never bothered. But I should because I love RStudio's interface and using SAS I by far prefer Enterprise guide to anything else.

It's a little hard to explain, but I'm sure PHP has its own best ways of thinking too. Websearch "pythonic" and a lot of interesting stuff will come up.
&gt; JS-ecosystem-like disasters. Oh god. Recently I was helping a coworker put some functionality into a nodejs docker image. Post build the image had ballooned to almost 200MB. He had a single JS dependency... Which had 150 chained dependencies.
Comparing a value to `None` usually means you've made a mistake. What would you expect the result to be? There's no obvious right answer, and as a matter of principle, when the right answer isn't obvious, Python refuses to guess. This means that your program will raise an error when you try to do the comparison. The alternative (which is what would happen in languages like Javascript or Perl, which do guess in those situations), is that the program would continue (even though you wouldn't really have an idea what it was doing, or why, at that point), and would most likely crash at some much later point, when the cause may not be obvious. Or worse, appear to work, but do something subtly wrong. 
Interesting, I'll take a look at this as I was thinking to use [great expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/README.md) library for data validation.
This was a great help. Does this require any modules to be imported?
Oh, source code is always with relation to something, like "this is the source code of your printer's driver", or "this EULA prohibits you from learning the source of this medical software".
Yes, only from the std : ``` from urllib.request import urlopen import json ```
That's really cool! I starred and forked yours and added drift and counter to it: (didn't keep the moon, lol) [https://github.com/Aperocky/python-snowterm](https://github.com/Aperocky/python-snowterm) 
I use urllib pretty heavily. I've never looked at the requests module, probably because it's not in the standard library documentation and I've never needed to look for a third-party module to do something I couldn't do.
Don't mess around with the ui, like someone else said, use requests and just POST the form to the url. Make sure you know what parameters you need.
I ended up adding a demo GIF check the README.md now. Thanks for the suggestion
cool, let me know what you think! I designed it to be as modular as possible and making it as easy as possible to plug it into existing pipelines/workflows.
Damn that's cool! I wanted to make a drift myself, but I also wanted it as simple as possible :)
Cool 👍
Did you check that site? \[This page\]([https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python/benchmarks](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python/benchmarks)) specifies what it is. 
I didn’t know intel had their own anaconda build. Anaconda is great (my opinion) and used by many people as a package manager because it handles dependencies and environments very well. I can’t comment on intels build, but regular anaconda is preferred by the scientific community for that reason. I don’t think you need to worry about nuancing builds or performance unless you really really have a good reason for needing to split hairs when it comes to performance.
Wouldn't it only encrypt the latest version of the file in Drive, so the revision history would still have the version prior to encryption?

Cool! Are you accepting PRs?
I have always wanted to try AWS. My big worry is it costing money just sitting there. Has it cost you anything, and if so, what conditions?
I love it. Also use Pycharm a lot, but vscode has been my primary lately.
Jupyter Notebook has this functionality. 
For now I'm staying on github. I'll move if they do something awful that i can't stand.
The bot and other replies gave a lot of good info, but I’d go a little further. Just bite the bullet and install Anaconda. Once installed, google Jupyter Notebook and/or preferably - Jupyter Lab. They do exactly what you’re asking for, and are great for learning the language. I believe they come ore-installed with anaconda, so you won’t have to install most anything else.
Please feel free! I didn't specify a license, which means, do what you want with it!
Visual Studio (IDE) doesn't have one. There's a third party plugin for it. I took a new job where they use Visual Studio, I asked my co-workers how to open a terminal _inside_ VS, they looked at me like I was crazy.
Of course!
Depends on the implementation of the mount; if you allow files to be send to the drive as well you might encounter some problems
This is far cooler than my little app! If you're interested in language programming, I have to point out what I think is one of the coolest scripts I've seen in python: https://github.com/quadrismegistus/prosodic
Thanks for the tip! I went ahead and did so, I hope it is welcome there!
Yeah I've been a long time notebook user myself, but they've just not been manageable and portable enough for me. I need to be able to give my scripts to someone and tell them to just run them without having to explain wtf a notebook is. Plus I've grown tired of checking in which order I executed the cells.
nice nice. I was never on in the first place because gitlab had free private repos, so the switch wasn't too rough on me

Yeah Im one of the few people who uses python in my group because we're SAS programmers by trade. So I get what you're saying. Notebooks have a learning curve. And it takes a while to understand exactly why they're beneficial in the first place. 
I have just have to find time then, also that would be nice working also like fortune (if I remember the name right) which tells a random joke every time you invoke it
This is a question best asked in /r/learnpython or on discord, check the sidebar for details.

It was a game changer for me... I wrote about it: [https://www.bluebill.net/python-in-an-interactive-docker-container/](https://www.bluebill.net/python-in-an-interactive-docker-container/)
&gt; Some say yes, some say no. To each there own i guess. You act as though this is just an opinion people have. HTML and CSS are actually Turing complete, and it has been proven. Is programming with them actually a good idea? No. Is it possible? Absolutely. That's not even up for debate. 
I'm a system engineer so I mostly work with hardware and bash/powershell. I picked up python just recently and still learning. So I rtfm but didn't understand all of it (I'm also Dutch). Anyway, so they optimized some packages but did they improve python itself? They did some comperasons with c and cpp... I guess it's not realy for regular use but power use only then. 
xhost +
Sometimes I see the posts on here and wonder what in the heck these people are actually trying to build. In what possible situation would anyone need to execute Python code from the clipboard?
Reading a little bit more about that indeed made it seem it was for more scientific/power use purposes. I'm more used to bash and powershell and wanted to see what the possibilities where with python. I found python a little easier to write complex tasks with but found that it was a little bit slower. I wondered this build would solve that but guess not. 
Lambda (and most functions as a service by other providers) does not cost you any money sitting there. You are charged by the amount of process time you consume when it is called and the number of requests made. Even better, every month the first 1 million requests and 400 GB Seconds of computer time EVERY MONTH. If you just playing around with it and are not hitting production scale it is very likely you will not be charged at all for playing around with it. All of that being said, if you need to use API gateway, S3, or any other AWS service you will need to consider the pricing for that as well.
Fair enough, I'll add the pip line so as not to be confusing.
Since you already have the formulas and know how to do it in excel - you are ahead of the game! &amp;#x200B; As other posters have mentioned, VBA for excel is a good choice (I started using VBA in AutoCAD many years ago to automate engineering tasks). VBA does do a nice gui and all and will work fine. But if you want to do anything outside of excel, it will get difficult (i.e. reading/writing to databases, web api interaction, etc.). &amp;#x200B; Personally, what I would do is use something like Jupyter ([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)) and prototype your excel formulas into python code. That way you can make sure that you understand the formulae. The nice thing about the Jupyter notebook environment is that you can use MathJax to display what the mathematical formula should be and define all of the parameters. The bonus is that you can also document the workflow in a separate testable system that can be easily shared. &amp;#x200B; It might also be worthwhile to use a tool like [https://www.draw.io/](https://www.draw.io/) to sketch a flow chart and other diagrams that can help you understand how you want you system to work and document the current system. Once you can visually see it, then it is time to figure out what tools would work best to achieve the goal. It might turn out that simple VBA macros would do the trick or you might need to use python. &amp;#x200B; For python, I would look at the pandas library: [https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/). It can read and write excel files by the dataframe. It also has some very powerful table manipulations on par or exceeding what excel is capable of. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Not entirely sure what you mean with 'improve python itself' but it seems to be focused on numerical computation. As they bundles cython I was quite intrigued. Based on the graphs, it does lead to better efficiency. 
Thank you all for the advice!
Thank you for the advice! I did learn about functions before writing this program and I forgot to incorporate them. I'll add the suggested improvements!
Thank you! I'll look in to them more 
After a cursory look, I really like it. Great job! When comparing it to Great Expectations library, I like with pandera, I can specify data type and multiple validators up front, instead of having to specify things in separate multiple function calls.
Awesome
Thank you :)
I was nervous about this when I first started using AWS but helpfully Amazon does help by allowing you to restrict setup options to free-tier compatible settings when deploying something like EC2 or RDS. Also the billing-dashboard shows a lot of detail around your current usage and forecasted costs for the month so if you do start to do anything chargeable then you'll likely notice pretty quickly and stop it before it accumulates. For more details check out the AWS documentation (for reference 750 hours allows something to run continuously for a month) https://aws.amazon.com/free/

When you import a file, it runs all the code in the file. In this case, it includes the input function which initiates user interaction (which we gather you don’t want). I don’t think the name variable is actually available for you though. The solution is to wrap the code you don’t want to execute on import in a ‘if __name__ == “__main__”:’ block. 
Here’s a good video tutorial on how this works: https://youtu.be/sugvnHA7ElY
Also, just noticed that this doesn’t belong in the python subreddit - this really should be posted in learnpython. 
&gt; *When you import a file, it runs all the code in the file*. It should not run all the codes in the file, only if i type: from X input **\*** Or am i totally wrong? What is the **\*** even for if that is the case?
Hi, I know I'm quite late but I just started doing this same thing and saw this. I have built my scrapy app, it works great. I want to build a Django framework, integrate that with the scrapy project. And then build a UI where the user can enter the URL and number of pages to scrape. Could somebody please guide me as to how can I achieve this?
!Remindme after 36 hours &amp;#x200B;
The * is to control the namespace - sometimes you want just a few variables from a module so don’t want to use dot notation, but don’t want to import intermediate variables either. With this statement you can pick and choose which ones you want access to without the risk of overwriting other names you have defined. The variable you import may depend on a whole bunch of logic - python doesn’t figure out which logic relates to your variable and which logic isn’t needed, so it runs the whole file.

Thanks man!
How are you doing this?
Anaconda already ships with the Intel MKL libraries that speed up numpy and script by about 5x. I’m not sure what Intel Anaconda does differently. 6x?
I compare the last sync time , last modified time in local file and last modified time for corresponding file in drive on the basis of that decide whether I there is a need to pull or push the changes 
On windows, the Google drive app does it. On Linux I think there is a package called google-drive-ocamlfuse
Try r/learnpython, see sidebar for details
I’m on my phone but I believe what you’re looking for is this. `from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select` This will let you loop through the select options and select one. Even if it’s dynamic. 
I use geany, which is a lot smaller. I used it to edit, save text, collapse text, highlight syntax and that's pretty much it. I execute via terminal / cmd. Things you don't use won't break.
I am writing a react SPA, where the routing is handled by the application itself, and all the separate components get their info as JSON from different routes in the background using fetch. So basically the only page the server load is the SPA, otherwise it is just sending and receiving JSON
Thanks for the info, this is really helpful! I’ll have a read through all you points in detail! 👍
Awesome! It might be difficult to quantify but to what extent do you think it’s helped you discover edge cases? I guess I’m asking, what is the ROI? Thanks for taking the time to answer :)
We inherited a project at work from another company. Just a simple web dashboard, with some forms and tables, showing the current state of a radio network. In total, it had 1177 dependencies.. Yes, over a THOUSAND dependencies. 
OK, sorry i offended you guys with what i thought was the answer. I was always told they weren't. Sorry i'm not up to date on what HTML and CSS are classified as. How dare i be wrong about something. 
How did you accomplish this?
To nice
I'm halfway through "Python Crash Course". I'm learning Java in school but want to learn Python and it's frameworks as well so I bought this book. Highly recommend. Mostly skimming through the "Part 1: Basics" since it's mostly the same theory as in Java, with a few differences in the implementation. Helps a lot though to become effecient quickly. The projects are where the gold lies I think, but for beginners the "Part 1" is fantastic too.
&gt; It always seemed to me that the best way to learn it was watching people doing it in the computer. Books show code too. You're supposed to code alongside it, do excercises so you get it in your fingers. And programming is a lot more *understanding and theory* than just remembering syntax in the beginning. Once you "get it" then moving between langugages is easier, and "thinking like a programmer" becomes a part of you.
Python is all about developmental speed not execution speed. If you need faster Python is the wrong language. Speed is seldom an issue with automation so it makes me wonder what you are doing. 
If you want to learn Python or any sort of software development, look at online learning from Udemy.com. I learned Python with this class https://www.udemy.com/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/. But don’t pay full price wait and see when it goes on sale again for 9.99 to 11.99. The instructor is Colt Steele and he is really good at explaining everything.
Have you considered [Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart), it is a drop in async replacement of Flask? If so I'd like to know your thoughts as I'm the Quart author.
Nice project - I like etymology too. Thanks for introducing me to these packages!
Me too :) As you know, if you read the blog. Welcome.
Python is great so don’t get me wrong when I say it can be slow. It can be slow based upon how it was designed but it can also be slow if you are a beginner and don’t approach software development in a way that leverages Python. In otherwords it takes awhile to learn Python and choose code that is fast. The Intel Anaconda is of no value for the work you do. In fact the Microsoft Supplied Anaconda is crap also. I never tried the generic Anaconda because I quickly gave up on Windows and installed Fedora Linux. With Linux I just use the native package manager. On the old Mac OS machine I used Homebrew with mixed results. Package management in Fedora is mixed as some don’t seem to get the immediate updates. On the otherhand I make it a point to avoid the bleeding edge when at all possible. You might see these huge speed up numbers for things like Numpy and other computational extensions to Python. That is the result of these packages being written in C or C++ for excursion speed. Effectively you run specialized native code to solve matirix computations and the like. Intel can extend these packages to use Intel hardware for short vector computation and such. This gives the math wizzes a huge speed up over the generic C/C++ codes. Unfortunately this does nothing for basic Python scripts that are not optimized through these special libraries. If speed is what you are looking for, in an easy to use language, Apples Swift is possible the best replacement for Python in the near term. Unfortunately they have not achieved ABI stability yet and the Windows implementation trails in usability at the moment. However Swift has a number of features borrowed directly from Python, Swift supports a REPL but also can be compiled. Unfortunately Swift really isn’t ready for prime time anywhere, however it is worth keeping an eye on and might already be worth considering for a demanding automation job. Beyond Swift there is nothing that really grabs me as a Python replacement. So you either put up with the speed issue or you go back to cryptic BASH scripts. Well there is a third option which is to use Swift to glue together a bunch of performance oriented scripts written in C++. But then you would need to be willing to write performance crtitcal parts of whatever you are doing in C++ ( which is likely less than ideal). This is one reason why I like the up and coming Swift as you can write very clear and sometimes very Python like code that can be evaluated and tested via an interpreter. Once you are happy the same code can then be compiled for faster operation. Actually there is a fourth option if you can digest C++ in this application. That is to look into ROOT and the C++ interpreter they support there. The idea of a C++ interpreter may seem odd which is why I left it for last. The big problem here is that C++ is hardly the language to write programs to replace BASH or Python scripts. 
Yes - looks like you found a partner with the same interests. Congrats for that and for the blog.
I think you will be interested in that package. Ety. Great that someone did it. And also so graphical and accurate, the output. Else I thought of doing it by myself. 
I don't know what the implications are for string++. But for int++, it's clear that you want to increment an integer by 1. &amp;#x200B; I guess, for strings, maybe add whitespace? &amp;#x200B; I can't say I agree with using += for collection types. That can lead to some confusing code, especially if you're using Numpy.
ROI is pretty high. It's mostly a wrapper utility for tests.
I agree with that pattern. Haven't needed to go there but, when doing database operations, I find it easier to manage a payload of arguments and error out when some necessary ones aren't received. &amp;#x200B; I can't say I see a downside to accepting arguments in this fashion. This is what `**kwargs` is for anyway.
"our" current way... if there are multiple people involved in these work flows, then you should really think about the group dynamic! If everybody understands spreadsheets, think about the impact on the group, if you move some or all of the work into Python. Jealousy? Hard feelings? Or, even if everybody is happy with your Python scripts, you might become the single person responsible for critical bits of the process (because nobody else knows Python), so open to getting called on weekends and holidays when *anything* breaks. Because it'll be automatic to finger the new stuff, and you'll have to prove it isn't in your scripts, it's in the old spreadsheets, or the other department's input. 
Mostly mass renaming files and analysis based on that. 
The speed is a minor complaint, I can live with it. My project is mostly mass renaming + analasys based on the filenames. So not realy worth getting into c++. Also not a big apple fan so I'll skip swift, just don't see the point. 
Really interesting. Thanks for posting the STL for the sound "barrel." Kid friendly and destructive with just a hint of danger. I like it.
Yes - already testing out ety. textblob looks really cool too - language identification would be pretty complicated otherwise.
You can also use Google Translate API for that. 
I use Intel's distribution for maybe a year? A bit more? For generic use it seems no different than a generic distribution. However, yes, if you spend most of your with numbers it is helpful. And they also keep the distribution 'together' in terms ancillary packages such as sympy, scipy, daal, tbb, mkl, pandas, numpy, etc... so you don't have keep up with them seperatly. 
You can get cerifications for python?
You can use the package called xlrd. You can install the package through the command prompt with typing "pip install xlrd". Python Outline: -- import xlrd -- open the excel file -- count number of rows and columns -- iterate through all the cells in the first column (with a For Loop) to match the your phrase. -- once found "break" the For Loop, then read the rest of the cells along the other columns in that row Example code here: https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2014/04/30/reading-excel-spreadsheets-with-python-and-xlrd/
This is such a broad question that can't possibly be answered with any truth. There are so many different industries that use programmers and their salaries are extremely diverse. It depends on what industry you go in to and what the demand is for that industry. If you want ballpark numbers just Google Python developer salary.
Do you mind posting some example pics please?
https://github.com/derricw/asciisciit/blob/master/README.md
We don't know the content of your courses but I would guess extremely entry level. Most jobs these days will ask for at least a bachelor's or equivalent experience 
Yeah, I'm not endorsing a specific practice, just saying that the += functionality is more than simply for loop iterations. 
CTO. Six figures, possibly seven, depending on your locale.
CTO. Six figures, possibly seven, depending on your locale.
As far as I understand from the info they give the 'optimizations' in the 'Intel build' are in the domain of data analytics. So I wouldn't expect much performance improvement over 'standard' CPython builds/distributions (including Anaconda) outside that domain (and even then only for specific libraries).
you will not be a python developer after an entry level hight school course tho lol 
This is also true.
I would like to know more
This is correct, you could just reverse the change.
I'm in high school right now and have slowly written a classifier ML algorithm for a club... it's not really working right now. Here's my repo: [https://github.com/th4t-gi/FPS-CJ](https://github.com/th4t-gi/FPS-CJ). If anyone knows a thing or two about Keras help would be much appreciated.
So go with Python then, you sounded like performance was an issue. It is what I do for the most part. I’m not doing pro level programming so Python is good enough for most of it. As for Swift don’t think of it as an Apple product but rather a new computer language with lots of potential to become mainstream in the future. I wouldn’t say it is ready to replace Python yet as as ripting language but it will be in far better shape by the end of 2019. Think of it like LLVM/CLang which is everywhere these days and has loss its Apple stigma. 
just for shits and giggles, delete that cache directory and give it another go.

Did I read hard coded word pairs? "Set" has 464 definitions in the Oxford English Dictionary. "Run" runs a distant second, with 396. Rounding out the top ten are "go" with 368, "take" with 343, "stand" with 334, "get" with 289, "turn" with 288, "put" with 268, "fall" with 264, and "strike" with 250.
Thanks, I'll take a look to those videos... and yes, I agree, but I thought people with more experience will be able to give me more feedback. Thank you very much!
Are you sure your `pip3.7` matches up with the python executable - i.e. they're in the same environment? If you're not using virtualenvs, do so.
You are correct. Apparently parasol is only updated for python 2.7. Do you know any good alternative packages for analyzing and plotting parametric equations?
thanks
It probably depends on location but in all likelihood the certification is meaningless.
IronPython is doing well, they are making steady progress on py3 conversion. It may not make a lot of sense for a python dev to use in general, but it is amazing for enhancing a C# application with python utility. I was able to get my company to adopt it as a plugin and script engine to enhance our product and has been immensely useful. As the ipy environment can use and call any of the .NET assemblies and access program objects and structures you can perform some feats that normally would be quite difficult with C# alone. Likewise the C# application can take data back from the python side, this makes spinning up dynamic or frequently changing interfaces easy and modular as an example. Because it is a reimplementation there is no GIL which on the one hand provides a significant speedup, being able to access the entirety of the .NET assembly system is also incredibly powerful. The downside is that without the GIL many of the C libraries python relies on do not and or cannot work. With one of the last releases of the ipy2 versions they did add support for using pip, it has mixed results and usefulness.

Right, but does off topic conversation warrant banning? That seems like a hostile overreaction to me. That punishment should be reserved for a proportionate offense, like hostile/abusive behavior. Also some kind of 3 strikes warning protocol seems more reasonable than the zero-tolerance ban-hammer.
The course I'm taking is preparing for my certification. I am not sure if this is the one my teacher is referring to but it might be. [https://pythoninstitute.org/](https://pythoninstitute.org/)
I'm taking courses online and plan on learning more from udemy. &amp;#x200B;
Say I know python as well as a college graduate, what jobs would could I apply for without a college degree?
And I would have only fear and respect for anyone doing that... Like the feeling I got when I saw a basic virtual machine implementated in pure PowerPoint slides...
I'm working on this simple text-based game, it's my first project https://slatebluerashrelationaldatabase-1.yeetus3.repl.run/ 
Github link? As a begginer i would like to participate.
There is no such thing as a python certification that means anything in any hiring market. I'm sorry. Also - what you leave said course with will not nearly be enough to hire you into more than an entry level position - assuming you manage to gather some domain knowledge along the way. Just knowing how to use python in a basic sense doesn't give you the capabilities to function in a full-time position.
That is really cool
I see. I am currently required to take an online course, which I am on python. The course is very basic as I finished 1/3 of a semester in one day. I will be taking additional courses on udemy to get the best understanding I can of python. Say I have the knowledge required to work full time, what jobs could I apply to and have a good chance of getting in? I can only work fulltime over summer break. I can work parttime over the school year after 4pm
I run the python user group at work and its targeted towards beginners. The single most important advice I can give you is to show them examples of how they can use the code to make their lives easier. For example - show them loops then show them how to create a bunch of excel files using a loop. If not they will become disengaged and forget the material.
You can talk about that in an hour, but that's way too much for complete beginners to understand that quickly. I do a teacher's bootcamp and it takes about a (very busy) day to get through all that stuff if you stop and give people a chance to use the tools along the way. If they hear it but don't do it, you'll lose them after variables. So if you are doing a seminar, you can introduce as many concepts as you want, but there will be little understanding. Or you can pick a smaller subset of the language (variables, conditions, and for loops) and be able to get through it in an hour. I'd much rather go short and deep than long and shallow. 
Quick question for you. Here's an example: `2018-12-29 20:44:10.461 | DEBUG | __main__:performAnalysis:496 -` How can I either: 1. Prevent logger.debug messages from printing to the terminal, or 2. Prevent all messages from my performAnalysis function from printing to the terminal? Thanks - I'm liking this a lot so far!
GO SLOW. SLOWER THAN YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO GO.
great, great projects derserve great READMEs
So one issue I assume you'll run into is ambiguities. E.g. A word that is written the same in multiple languages, or more simply, a word which could be translated into english multiple ways (depending on the context). I wonder if there's a good solution for this (e.g. list possible translations, choose correct interpreted meaning) 
Where can I find a list of the languages supported and are there dialects supported, particularly for endangered languages
This is tutorial for begginers aimed at data science, but the tools involved (jupyter, pandas, matplotlib, notebook files) are well suited to give that immediate gratification that a begginer needs. https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial I can't recommend Brandon Rhodes strongly enough, he is a master.
Don't have sex with the students.
I see that you map one image to a character based on greyscale. next challenge: group a cluster of pixels to one character based on the shape of the character 
What helped me the most was to see a "Real problem" solved with code, that is simple enough to be a one-pager, but not so simple you couldn't have solved it with paper and pencil. Think doing math or maybe manipulating text strings. Splitting the dinner bill and figuring out how much each person should tip based on their bill, or what I did was see how much shipping cost everyone owned when we all lumped our orders in together. in other words, I split the shipping cost based on people's percentages of their order costs compared to the total. Once they see what a Python program/script can do, break down the parts (such as variables) so they can directly relate what variables can do with what they did in the program. When I was first introduced into variables, I was thinking calculus and not understanding variables could be strings and such, so doing a string manipulation would probably be good as well.
that's cool, but the coolest ascii thing I ever saw was years back a guy wrote a video-&gt;ASCII converter and streamed the world cup in ascii via telnet to the public. http://www.ascii-wm.net/
You may want to split character\_builder responsibilities.

unless you think you need to go at a sufficiently slow pace. Then go at that pace.
Openpyxl is a far better solution when working with Excel files. 
God I need to do something like that. I just have my shit spread across /usr/bin folders, gists and whatever
I've stated putting lists of tips in a OneNote notebook.
With only one hour I think it's best to show them just enough that they will be inspired to learn more. I also don't think you need to include anything about functions, as beginners will not appreciate their use when you can just type everything directly into the .py file and run it.

I regularly write a single quick test with Hypothesis which finds bugs that I would probably have missed otherwise, or spent hours debugging from production reports. [The official quickstart guide](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) has a nice (ie simple but plausible) example: from hypothesis import given, strategies as st @given(st.text()) def test_decode_inverts_encode(s): assert decode(encode(s)) == s which tests that run-length-encoding and decoding any string gets you the original string back. Bonus points if you can see the bug in the encode/decode functions before having it pointed out! I'd say I get three main benefits from using Hypothesis: 1. I write fewer tests and hardly ever use static lists of inputs, because `@given` tests are as or more powerful. You can mix `@given(...)` and `@pytest.mark.parametrize(...)` too, btw, which is even more efficient ;) 2. My tests actually help me learn about the behavior of my code, rather than just failing when something changes. I think of this as "TIL testing" and it's great. 3. Thinking "how would I test this with Hypothesis?" often makes me write better code. For example, methods which *perfectly* invert each other are really easy to test, testing special cases feels more painful so I try to avoid them, and so on. Try Hypothesis for 30-60 minutes on a project that already has some tests, and I think you'll be convinced! e.g. replace a static parametrize with `@given`, find a pair of functions that should invert each other, find something that should be idempotent, etc. Works with pytest, nose, good ol' unittest, etc. 
Thanks, bot. I posted the question in r/learnpython just like you suggested.
If you are working with columns instead of rows, you can use a filter. Just select the working area then turn on the filter. A pull down option is then available on the top row of the selected area. If you click this for any column, you can quickly see what data or text is in that column.
I've read a lot of Hyndman's stuff, and I've only ever seen R. [https://robjhyndman.com/software/](https://robjhyndman.com/software/) &amp;#x200B; Most of the techniques wouldn't be that difficult to implement in Python. Or you could just use R.
If you've got the experience then you could qualify for most entry level jobs. It'll come down to individual employers whether they really want a degree or not. What you need is a portfolio of your work. A degree is your paper that says I'm the field you studied, you've achieved a certain level of knowledge, along with other aspects. By having a GitHub account with frequent commits, unique projects, contributions to other projects, that'll be your way of saying that you have experience, you can collaborate with others, etc
Sounds like a great project! How much experience do you have with Python? Have you played around with other requests libraries?
That is good advice a genuinely appreciate it, thank you
I taught intro to programming at my University one semester. I would say it took complete beginners greater than eight weeks meeting two hours a week to understand all those things. If your audience is people who have never used python, but have programmed you'll be ok. If your audience is real beginners, I would basically stick to common date structures like integer, float, etc. Go over variables, as they really just store data structures. Then do conditional statements if there is any time left. An hour goes by very fast when you're trying to teach lol. If for some reason you go passed conditionals, cover more advanced data structures like lists and throw in loops with that. Go slow. Have lots of examples, and have them set aside pre coded and tested so you know they work so you don't feel silly making a little mistake. Good luck and have fun!
I have a notebook of bugs and some brief description of a solution. I put an asterisk next to it each time I encounter a similar one more than once. As it fills up it makes me feel better about how much I’ve solved and it also allows for easy browsing when I encounter some issue. 
Based.on your prior question here https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pvwb5/can_you_use_python_to_analyze_survey_data/ it seems clear the problem is you don't know the python ecosystem or have fundamental software expertise. Mind linking your GitHub so we can see how awesome you are?
Give them a reason to learn what they're learning, like yeah operators are great but when tf am I gonna use them?
Eek that sounds like an absolute nightmare to hardcode.
Kind of like what google translate does
List of the languages supported can be found in the Internet. With the ISO code. But endangered languages. I have to take a look. I don’t think Textblob can do that. You can give it a try then with Google Translate API.
Yes. What can be done is use a different translator API than this one I used. Maybe Google Translate. A check can be introduced there. If you want to do it, you can do a pull request and I will accept it :) 
Not hard coded pairs. The thing that is hardcoded is language paired with language codes. Read it carefully. The blog never says the words are hardcoded. :) 
Hey, I think I saw that too! Pretty impressive, although I definitely wouldn't ever want to make one myself. :)
I just started using the cacher app to start organizing this sort of stuff. It has a decent interface and creates a private gist on github https://www.cacher.io/
Definitely. Anytime I make a new pattern for me, or cool function, or something I think I'm going to use later, I make a little example.py for it in an untracked subdir. I call these my scratch files. Once I get something real nice here, I'll use it in my project. However I also keep a "Python" directory, and in it go "examples" and "snippets". I'll copy those little example.py files over there as well. For other things I have what I call "scaffolding", and this is the stuff I use on virtually every project. An example of this is logging. I have a complete, badass logging set configured via YML that configures colored logs and everything. I literally copy the logging.py from my logging scaffolding directory, the logging.yml file, include it in my project and voilà, full featured logging set up. I do this with logging, README.md, CRUD operations, external API patterns, etc etc. Otherwise every project would take forever. 
Link plz
I taught a course exactly like this in college. Intro to programming with python for all majors as part of a software development club. I made PowerPoints and exercises, etc. in the end we all made a sudoku solver together with graphics and everything. Here is the repo of that project, I have all of the PowerPoint slides and stuff if you want them, DM me. https://github.com/dlowrey/sudoku-solver/blob/master/README.md My advice is to have PLENTY of exercises and examples. Even of the most simple things, like assigning variables. It’s really a different way of thinking and most people take time to get use to if. 
Exactly this. They might not learn "programming" this way but it's a gateway to it. 
I made a project out of the same curiosity a couple of months back. You can take a look at this. :) It will help you out for sure.

Is it really necessary to use another app for something like this?
GitHub 
It's not necessary but it makes organizing my code quicker and easier than if I weren't using the app. It's also not necessary to use Pycharm to develop in but it sure does make organizing a project easier than using VIM or another similar editor. 
Thank you. I'm leaning towards R as well.
i wish my 3 credit course taught me this. i learned loops but nothing useful if i am just looping a count... =/
I'm going to strongly disagree with this one. If this were an advanced python subreddit, sure, those rules make sense. But python isn't an advanced topic, and this subreddit isn't just for advanced programmers. This sub acts as the landing page for reddit's python programmers, and those wanting to start to learn python. There's plenty of reasons to want to encourage "Hello World" posts, primarily welcoming a growing and active community where members feel a sense of belonging. If you don't want to see that list of things, read a news letter or a blog. r/python is a community forum. And those projects are what the python community is working on. Not everyone is at the same advanced level. And that's awesome because it means there's new programmers growing the language, not just grey beards standing guard over a forgotten codebase. Looking point by point, * On your point 1: I'm not against the self post rule, though I'd be happy altering it to self posts and image posts. I enjoy random arts and crafts and a lot of them don't need an explanation that a self post rule would prompt. The self posts would help flag blog spam though, so this idea would be worth looking into in more depth. * On your point 2: I'd argue the learning rule is strictly enforced. There's a limit to how rapidly mods are able to respond to learning posts since they're human with real world responsibilities but that doesn't detract from the strictness of enforcement, just the response time. All things considering I think it's typically pretty impressive. * On point 2 part 2: It's a terrible idea to ban users who answer questions on the learning posts though, for two strong reasons. First, I've seen little evidence that an average redditor will post a second question to this sub after they've done that once and been referred to r/learnpython, regardless of whether or not their first question was answered here. Most users want to ask questions on a forum where they're going to be accepted, and after the initial phase of seeking help, they know about r/learnpython. From that point forward they usually direct their questions there. There are of course exceptions, but they're few and far between as far as I can tell. **So users who answer questions here don't actually encourage more learning questions on this sub**. Second, and I grant this is more open to interpretation, python is suppose to be welcoming to new users who want to learn to code. Answering simple questions and directing users to a proper location to ask more questions strengthens the community. It makes new programmers want to try new things, and feel comfortable asking for help. And it avoids the Stack Overflow Problem where no one wants to ask a question because of the ridicule they'll probably get. * On point 3: I said it earlier, if you don't want these don't read a community forum. This is what makes up the community, and it's amazing to see how many others are still starting out python and where they're taking their journey. * Expanding on 3: That said this touches close to something I would like to ban, specifically blog spam and scam posts. There are occasionally a few blogs or online 'education' services that I'd be happy to ban. They typically have a ton of ads, five sentences, and two lines of code. Those are just spammy and if there's evidence (and the evidence is a key point here) that they're just spamming posts to get clicks, they should be removed from the sub and the user could be banned for a short period of time, and a permanent ban if they keep it up after their short ban is up. Before I'd be in favor of enacting that rule though I want a measurable metric with which to discern between someone self promoting trying to get into programming-education (something I'm in favor of) and some blog phoning it in for clicks. **I'd also be very happy flat out banning all Udemy posts** from this sub since they charge to take a lot of their courses and have had little to no response when it's been shown that a number of their courses are flat out stolen from other content creators without permission or compensation. They also have an extreme tendency to either spam all over reddit, or encourage spamming on their behalf.
Why don’t you make an app to do it?
 Golygon_brute_force.py import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import itertools as it max_sides = 8 [[[plt.plot(*o.T),plt.show()] for p,o in enumerate([np.vstack((m,m[0])) for m in ([np.cumsum(np.vstack([(l[n])*k for n,k in enumerate([np.array([[(1-i%2),(i%2)] for j in range(i)]) for i in np.arange(j)+1])]),axis=0) for l in np.array(list(it.product([-1,1], repeat = j)))]) if all((np.array_equal(m[-1],[0,0]),len(np.unique(m,axis=0))==len(m)))])] for j in 8*(np.arange(int(max_sides/8))+1)] &amp;#x200B;
I think for drawing it would be rational to use embedded library called “Turtle”. https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html
Seriously. Just make an account at some service and throw all your trash up.
Ha..ha... Good example!!!
I have a few bits that I copy and paste around from various things, a lot of my reusable code just gets made into libraries. I don't exactly want a tangled web of dependancies to deal with, so I'll copy and paste the libraries into projects and sometimes even modify them, but I still treat them like real libraries with a sane API and documentation.
You've come a long way, python lawyer.
holy crap, untracked subreddit! u genius!
Me: I should not use these too much. I want this code to be readable. Me in a hurry: "".join([I for I in x if [j for j in I if j&gt;3]])
Ha ha... I also do the same thing. It's just so tempting to use a lambda or a list comprehension. But in one of the next videos...I am going to talk about time boxing it.... 
https://matevzkunaver.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/hopkins-test-for-cluster-tendency/
Same, I've got a code snippets notebook with sections for Python, Powershell , Javascript etc. 
Minor question-- why the second internal list comprehension rather than `any` on a generator comprehension?
Didn't even know about generator comprehensions! That would be way too readable anyway for a proper l33t haxxor meme coding method. 
Why not just have a `scripts` repo in Github? 
It groups the image into same size rectangles. Per rectangle it converts the rgb colors into a grey scale value and then chooses a char accordingly. I've never tested it with different formats bc it was just a little project and the file names are hard coded. 
Will do once I get back home :) 
nice man, didn't know that's illegal. ffs
Fuck it, everyone should know. I deeply love list and dict comprehension and I dont care what my parents think!
And you should !! They are awesome..
Beazley's python cookbook is pretty good. Saved me some time more than once.

Sounds like what you want is in 3.7: from dataclasses import dataclass then use dataclass as your class decorator.
It would be way to harsh to ban for a first offense (with the exception of carpet spamming), and I don't see it in the proposal that it would be required. 
If it's a rare command/one liner I want to track, I write it in a [cheatsheet]( https://github.com/Kraymer/F-dotfiles/tree/master/cheat/.cheat) (see python [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) program). If it's a a whole library or project I star/fork it on github If it's a blog post I bookmark it. If it's code I wrote and I'm proud of I write a [blog](http://kray.me) post about it. That covers all my cases.
If it's that reusable I usually put it on pypi and pip install it.
If they are library (i.e. usable by anyone) then document them and share them. Otherwise never look at them, the problem with spells is that after some time you don't know how they work and you simply tell the formula, causing more damage than anything

Been using Azure Notebooks. I have a basics project where that has all the basic topics of Python broken out by Juypter Notebooks. I.e. Functions, OOP, dictionaries etc. Anytime I learn something new I add to that specific notebook. Then I have snippets project broken out by notebooks with a major topic as the name. Pretty easy system to use as I learn and write scripts for each job.
I would suggest you to start practicing on [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com) Solving some challenges on daily basis will definitely sharpen your skills. Have you read [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) ? 
from teach important python as teachpy teachpy.variables() teachpy.prints() teachpy.conditionals() teachpy.loops() teachpy.functions() 
I find hackerrank is good for problem solving but not so good for learning specific languages. Kaggle is good for working with data and you can learn a lot from the shared notebooks.
Okay i think that is a good option thankyou and i have pdf of this book....so what do you say ? Is it good ?
To give back to the thread (and the community, because Python async is a PITA!), I finally managed to read and understand and fail at enough to get the following example, which I feel many could easily adapt, up and running; If you want to run it, put chromedriver.exe in your python path or modify the code. import os import sys import selenium from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC import traceback import asyncio from events import Events from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor import concurrent.futures driverPath = os.path.dirname(sys.executable) def googleSearch(driver, term): try: #print("Driver in googleSearch", driver) driver.get("http://www.google.com/search?q=" + term) try: WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, """//*[@id="hdtb-msb-vis"]/div[1]"""))) except: traceback.print_exc() return(False) return("the google search succeeded!") except: traceback.print_exc() return(False) def newDriver(driverPath): print("starting driver async") driver = webdriver.Chrome(driverPath + r"\chromedriver.exe") return(driver) def createDrivers(numberOfDrivers): numberOfDriversList = list(range(numberOfDrivers)) driverList = [] futuresDict = {} with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor: for x in numberOfDriversList: futuresDict.update( { executor.submit(newDriver, driverPath) : x } ) for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futuresDict): try: retval = future.result() except: traceback.print_exc() else: #print(retval) driverList.append(retval) return(driverList) def makeRequestsUsingDrivers(driverList, termList): listOfTupLists = [] while termList != []: tupList = [] for driver in driverList: try: term = termList.pop() except: break tup = [driver, term] tupList.append(tup) listOfTupLists.append(tupList) returnsList = [] futuresDict = {} with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor: for innerItem in listOfTupLists: for driver, term in innerItem: futuresDict.update( { executor.submit(googleSearch, driver, term) : driver } ) for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futuresDict): try: retval = future.result() except: traceback.print_exc() else: #print(retval) returnsList.append(retval) return(returnsList) termList = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z","a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"] try: driverList = createDrivers(8) nowaythiswillwork = makeRequestsUsingDrivers(driverList, termList) print(nowaythiswillwork) except: traceback.print_exc() finally: for driver in driverList: driver.close() &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It’s fantastic. Will test your knowledge of Python and help you understand how to organize code in a small program like a Tic Tac Toe game. 
Great project btw which gui you used for it Tkinter or Wx Python.
Okay i am going to start it right know and will surely let you know about my experience haha. And yeah of course thankyou so much.
I would really love to have a copy of the excercises and examples. This will certainly help with my teaching Python also. Thanks in advance.
Np. 
I used to have a VimWiki on gitlab, now I use pandoc markdown for the same purpose and have a 'best practices' 'book' for various languages and frameworks. Sphinx was one of the options, since I write Python docs in it, but I opted for Pandoc's easier syntax and easier LaTeX templating. I autogenerate a pdf on each change, too.
I frequently abuse list comprehensions for all kinds of things. z=\[os.rename(file,newfile) for (file,newfile) in zip(old,new)\]
Sorry this happened, for now I will suggest you to use clearblanklines first and then other functions. Currently working on the next version with OOP to make it more robust. Thanks for using textcleaner.

&gt; Say I have the knowledge required to work full time You don't and you won't. &gt; I can only work fulltime over summer break. &gt; I can work parttime over the school year after 4pm Don't bother. Nowhere is going to want to hire someone like you as a regular employee. Go to college and get an internship. An internship would be a great fit for what you're looking for. A summer is only a couple months, which would be just enough time for an experienced dev to get productive in a new environment.

https://youtu.be/ZDa-Z5JzLYM this guys beginner series is excellent
That seems fine to me?
I did not actually. It is still a CLI. I planned to. But did not have the time to after. Shifted to Data Viz projects mainly. 
Honestly, for me it seems very straight forward. The line of code you wrote down is readable.... Shit hits the fan when you start adding logic of map, filter and multiple for loop clauses to it !!
You could make an index app which allows you to categorise all your scripts to hopefully let you find the ones you need quicker. However, by what you have written I imagine they don't naturally fit into categories. The other option is that all scripts have a series of tags that you give them. Then you have a search app that will filter out by tags. 
Bugs in your bug logging app breaks the universe.
I wouldn't classify that book as anything but beginner book though. 
Hey, I actually wanted you to read this book [Invent your own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/) [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) is for beginners who want to learn Python. Thanks. 
Sorry that I can’t tell you as I never tried to use python builtin server, I was using flask and never had that issue. Then I migrated to node/express and finally go. From what I understand these web servers just send the closest path so when you request “guide/1” it will send whatever is under “/guide/“. I know in Go you have to put the trailing slash for it do so. So “/guide” will only match exact path while “/guide/“ will match any route starting with “/guide/“ no matter what comes behind that

I use paper. I am about 18 notebooks in. I write out code by hand into those books. I do it more for the sake of memory than for the sake of keeping code. I have off and on within those 18 notebooks I've had the desire to start using some kind of snippet manager, but without much of an idea of how I'd go back and check the code. I've always found it much easier just to use my brain and write stuff from scratch unless I'm really stuck. The problem is less the keeping of code, it's how you expect to retrieve it when you actually need it as that requires forethought that I'm not entirely sure is possible. Finally, I love your characterization. I've been saying for years that programming is basically magick, you utilize a set of arcane symbols to enact your will. Sure, it's constrained to exist within this strange computational universe, but that doesn't make it any less magickal.
Oh okay !! Thanks and Automate the Boring Stuff is also pretty good it has some of the topics i was not aware of.
I feel like an idiot for not knowing dict comprehensions were a thing!/ So long list comprehensions of the form [dic.update( {k:v}) for k, v in zip.... ] lol. 
Awesome! 
I would like to start by actually getting Python to work on my PC. Then I want to learn Python. Then I want to think of a cool thing to do with Python. Then I want to do it. Maybe a screensaver that comes up and says, "Luke, I am your Father. And I made this with Python37." Or maybe I will make nothing and be that wannabe coder who just talks about coding but never does anything about it. #Pleasedontactuallybethatguyin2019.
In an hour you can talk a little bit about how these structures do cool stuff. Something I like as part of an initial one hour thing is to preload a turtle program and show them ways to mess with it. Then unleash them to experiment. 
Remindme! 1 day
I like the way this sounds. Im a dnd fan and pythoner so it sounds awesome. Would you mind sharing your spell book?
Another cool project!
Where's that file path again. 
Some of the scripts have become completely black magic to me -- even though I wrote them. I just use them and figure that they'll work out a certain way, just not how (unless I open the code). 
&gt;example.py This is a really cool idea. Sort of like a test for that snippet, right?
This is a pretty good idea too. I might actually implement it.
My copy of Beazley's book is basically highlighted all over the place. Used that constantly. And by the way, his Python Cookbook is essentially a grimoire of cool spells, if you think about it.
Aha thanks man! Worked really hard for it.
Thank you.
It is pretty easy to install modules on Windows. Besides, this question has no context. 
While I do maintain a folder of useful scripts I have found that if the script is useful it's usually a good idea to blog about it. This has helped me remember what the script is for as well as how it works and it also ends up helping other people. Plus I get the power of Google to search my site for my own examples. Here's my blog - https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/ I write about a lot more than scripts nowadays but I still write about them when they are especially useful
&gt;Finally, I love your characterization. I've been saying for years that programming is basically magick, you utilize a set of arcane symbols to enact your will. Sure, it's constrained to exist within this strange computational universe, but that doesn't make it any less magickal. I read a post a year or so back that inspired the categorization actually. Good post on it: \- [https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/18/programming-is-magic/](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/18/programming-is-magic/) \- Associated Hacker News thread: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8769351](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8769351)
I didn't know I needed cheat until you posted this. Two very good uses for it. Thanks. 
Agreed. It's honestly the same. But I still recommend using pip or comes if you have it installed. 
Thanks :)
Everything, no matter how small goes into private Gitlab repos. For the kinds of one-liners you're talking about. I've got a repo containing an Jupyter notebook with all of the one-liners and helper functions cached. This way, I've got the code, and example of the output, and a brief markdown description saved all in one place.
by the time you download linux, setup a functioning dual booting system, and learn to use linux if you dont already know how, you could have learned how to properly/easily install modules on windows
Not uvloop though right? 
Not uvloop though right? Some just don't work on windows 
Whoa! I've bought your books man, and love your interviews. Your articles are a really good resource too. Pleasure to meet you good sir.
I taught Python in high school to kids who never programmed before. It took me two one-hour classes just to get the environments setup and ensure everyone knew how to do what I planned throughout the year. Have everything setup ahead of time - if you have the opportunity, send them instructions on how to setup the environment on their own machines, and how to verify the setup before they get to class. And as someone else already said, have example code ready, be prepared to walk them through it, cover less and cover it deeper, and go slower than you think you should. 
Ha! I was going to try to make something like this next weekend to have some ASCII art for a game I play. Thanks for sharing. :)
This. The best way to teach people programming is by getting them interested in learning more. That way you dont have to cover absolutely everything and the students will find ways to continue learning on their own while being able to use the stuff they learn in real world scenarios.

Did sort of a same project but mine is using elastic search to do data analysis. Cool stuff my dude.
That's fine for small scripts that you use as standalone programs (even though you don't want to change them), but to incorporate into other code it only yields bugs I the long run. Imho of course
Thanks :) Elastic search?

Specifically which modules are you having trouble with? Can you use Ananconda?
for drawings, processing.py using trinket.io allows easy drawings see like here : https://www.pythonmembers.club/2018/05/29/game-map-rendering/ go slowly, your plan seems nice, once they are comfortable with writing their own scripts, introduce more concepts. keep sessions short and number of pupil manageable. ask if they understood.
yeah, a search engine https://www.elastic.co/

Ur welcome. What 2 uses are you talkin about ? 
Not tried i basically want to install numpy and scipy but i cant figure out how to install them
suggest keep a file of name and description as well as file name. that way you can search and browse easier.
How many lessons do you have? You can't cover that in one, unless it's really long. My experience is that getting people hands on is the best way to get them to understand. So probably build your lesson around practical examples they can do themselves.
What a one-liner! 
I've just made a giant project file with script sections header'd by comment text labeling it Really going to need to organize it before too long Just don't know how yet. 
I used to use Evernote. Is format the code using some website is found, then past it into Evernote and add various tags. It could still take some digging to find something, but it worked pretty good. Then work blocked Evernote. I tried moving to Google docs, but it must doesn't work. 
On windows, just use Anaconda.
I wasn't sure if I was abusing them, so I looked in my currently open file. I found this: digitsneeded.append(max(len(str(round(x[i]))) if type(x[i]) in (float, int) else 0 for x in data)) Then I did some more digging and found this: val = sum((0 if x == '00' else float(x.lstrip('0'))) * 60 ** i for i, x in enumerate(time.strip().split(':')[::-1])) and this: athletes = [re.search('[0-9]+', athlete).group(0) for athlete in athletes] and finally: [[i.name, i.category, i.grade if i.grade != 0 or i.category not in i.CalculateStandards() else f'None ({len(i.CalculateStandards()[i.category].keys())}/3)'] if i.name in linkedrunners else None for i in runners]
Lol... I would say you have taken it a bit too far !!! Do one thing... Calculate the time it takes for python to interpret this code and compare it to when you write it normally without list comprehension. 
In a console application or a GUI application?
It gives the impression that it just generates a list `z` but in fact it renames a bunch of files and `z` is a useless list of `None`s. This is more explicit so a casual glance shows exactly what it does: for (file,newfile) in zip(old,new): os.rename(file,newfile)
Thanks. It's always nice to meet one of my readers
They're only hard to read because of the ternary operator (if/else) but once you see it it's clear what it does.
Yes. It is easier to install the necessary toolchain (compilers) for native extensions on Linux than it is on Windows. Besides, some simply don't work on Windows (technically, MS doesn't have a C compiler, but Python from python.org wants to be compiled using MS compilers only, so, even the extensions' author wrote their extension in a portable way, you might not be able to compile it). Some (actually, quite popular) native extensions are written in Fortran, very few, but still possible extensions are written in Go or Rust or maybe something else. Installing all of these compilers on Windows is even more complex than installing MS toolchain (which is also non-trivial). Anaconda on Windows helps in that it doesn't compile Python with MS toolchain (they use MinGW), but then they will be inevitably behind the upstream all the time, and it doesn't help with extensions which simply weren't designed to work on Windows.
Forgot to ask, what's the LICENSE.txt for this one? I'm just using it for personal use, but you should still add one to be clear your expectations on that front. My rule of thumb is if I'm using GitHub then I'm cool with MIT/GPL(n). I do my private repos where I retain rights to BitBucket (or soon my new Raspberry Pi repo server! :) )
Console app for now, gui later once I get the console working. 
You're totally right. I missed that it was assigning the list to a variable. 
P.s. I have posted to /r/learnpython - I did not remember that subredit until after I posted here. sorry if this is frowned upon.
It's actually much easier to do in a GUI app for multiple reasons.
Yes! I'm mostly a Ruby lesson at this point but I have different sections for more general stuff like security and language specific things.
Hey! By default, the \`logger\` is configured to print on the terminal with a \`DEBUG\` level. If you don't like that, you can set the \`LOGURU\_LEVEL\` environment variable to \`INFO\`. That way, each time you start a new Python script and use Loguru, debug messages will not appear to the pre-configured stderr handler. Alternatively, you can \`.remove()\` the existing terminal handler, and configure it at your convenience with \`logger.add(sys.stderr, level="INFO")\`. &amp;#x200B; For fine-grained control over which logs should or not be sent to your sink, you could \`.add()\` an handler with a \`filter\` function. &amp;#x200B; For exemple: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python def filter\_sink(record): if record\["function"\] == "performAnalysis": retrun False return True &amp;#x200B; \# All messages are logged to the terminal, except if they comes from the "performAnalysis" function logger.add(sys.stderr, level="DEBUG", filter=filter\_sink) \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; Or, probably better as it does not use hard-coded names: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python \# Use the "debug\_logger" instead of "logger" in your "performAnalysis()" function debug\_logger = logger.bind(skip\_me=True) &amp;#x200B; logger.add(sys.stderr, level="DEBUG", filter=lambda r: "skip\_me" not in r\["extra"\]) \`\`\` &amp;#x200B;
What kind of jobs target selenium skills? I've worked with it alot, mostly self taught 
Hey thanks!, but I wanted to know if there was a built in function in any module at least. This doesn't look like one.
You should be in /r/LearnPython because this question is very basic. 
I have 160+ folders of Django bookmarks
Mostly QA engineering jobs that I've seen.
For the first one, it normally took about 0.05 ms. Changing it made it take about half that (0.028 ms). The second one normally took about 0.0038 ms, and when changed took about 0.0028 ms, about 35% faster. The third took 1.3 ms, and 1.4 ms when changed, which is 8% faster. The fourth took 1.7 ms, which increased to 1.85 ms, a 9% change.
Would be great to see if you yourself actually put any effort into solving this
Totally sounds possible. Check out the os and shutil imports. You will need to read in folder names, have some sort of delimiter to identify the relevant portion of the name, and use that info to identify the correct folder path. Ive never used shutil but that should allow you to move the folders. If its just text dats you can set up a read write stream, but moving folders is probably preferable.

I've had good luck with the [Python Keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) library. I think it will do just what you're looking for.

Thanks for linking this. If my reading is right, I'll be using the shutil.copytree operation to move the actual folder. Do I just need to combine that with an operation that will read the name on the folder?

Yes, this snippet is from a much larger class that does involve updating other values when this one value is set. I just wanted to strip down my example to make it simpler to read, but in retrospect I think I should have included more complexity. :)
What did you do in ES? Would love to see the respective code if possible. 
Thanks again.
Ok, Good luck!
1. Created a stream of tweets tracking a keyword. (twython) 2. Made a model out of the tweets and extract the sentiment from each tweet (textblob) 3.

As a beginner, I try to solve Project Euler #3 question. I am really a beginner.
I'm not sure "commands of external program" means. Have you looked at `pexpect`? That can control terminal-based programs. "File-&gt;Open" implies a GUI, but you said you want more than mouse control, so I'm not sure.

You can also generate keyboard input using pyautogui, for example opening a file is usually the shortcut ctrl + o: pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'o')

This is a very interesting question because I’ve probably lost more than I care to say over the years. (It gets worse with age guys). One thing that is worth considering is something that I’ve experienced in the regulated and R&amp;D segments of industry, and that is to keep log books. Real paper lab log books, designed for such activities. Paper because I’ve lost too much over the years to system failures, screw ups, and disorganization. If you are in the right niche there may be legal justification for paper log books. You actually can benefit from two types of log books. One for projects another a basic daily diary of what happened that day and what you might have done to fix it. I’ve spent most of my life in the automation world so if I’ve done software work that means an interaction with the real world and other electronic devices. Back in the day that meant a lot of RS232 devices. It is incredibly useful to have a sketch of the RS232 cable configuration, tables of device registers settings, tables of communications settings and other software related info in one place. Often this can be combined into one log book that has all other electrical and mechanical engineering developmental info. The thing here is that a notebook allows for hand written text, sketches and drawings, pasted in documents (might be a legal problem), data collection and so forth. There isn’t a software package I know of that covers everything that one can do in a paper notebook. One thing that I find extremely helpful in regards to permanent documentation is HTML files that use simple HTML tables to document register / value pairs. A classic example here is working with industrial printers that have a multitude of configuration values. HTML tables allow you to rapidly build up a configuration document for all those registers. Basically a bunch of static pages for each unique location. You don’t even need a web server but in a large organization it might be nice to have a server setup. Written generically the files are readable everywhere. More importantly one needs to actively change the data avoiding the easy data alteration possible say in spreadsheet files. HTML even version controls well in a repository. To be honest I haven’t gotten into the online repositories like Github. The big problem here is that online access isn’t always available. Even at work you can’t always access the internet on the plant floor. (Terrible WiFi or too much concrete). They might be a good idea for backing up locally stored info though. When it comes to HTML files I keep them simple so that they survive browser updates. Plus I generally use simple editors. If anybody knows of an HTAmL editor that allows embedding easily SVG graphics, jpgs and similar data into a single HTML file i would be interested. Linking to external files just leads to broken documents so everything should embedd in one file. I’ve experimented with various electronic log booking software and even blogging software but so far nothing strikes my fancy. Also snippet management in most IDEs sucks. This is a big frustration really. Also I’ve had IDEs blow away entire projects so backups are critical. 
👍 would be nice !
How much time did it take from start to finish?
That’s great 
Nope.
Thanks :)
"Fluent Python" and "High Performance Python" would be my two recommendations.

Okay, I thought you installed pip packages, such as requests or numpy, into the virtual environment so you could have different versions. I’m just a little confused on how it all works.
While I think the for loop is more clear, they *could* have assigned the list comprehension to `_` which would have made it obvious that they were throwing away the results of the comprehension. `_ = [os.rename(file,newfile) for (file,newfile) in zip(old,new)]` If we want to micro-optimize here, they're also wasting time by constructing a list that is then just thrown away. I say this, but my code is littered with examples of the above. I love list comprehensions to a fault and I regularly admit that as a failing to my team.
you do but they can still be installed on the system python. just make sure to activate the virtualenv once you start coding 
You can leave your system python alone. When you create a virtual environment, it'll have no packages installed, even if your system interpreter does. Each virtual environment is completely separate from every other environment in this regard, so you could have any packages installed in any environment and each are separate

You'll want to check out the following methods: os.scandir() os.mkdir() shutil.move() I just wrote a script to sort my photos for me into year/month directories doing using those exact methods. 
This sounds totally good intentioned
Won't it just prompt for 2FA or such? It usually gives you a good 5-6 tries. 
Not all sites.
Derek Banas videos on YouTube. 
Save them in keepass, no need to loop through files. No programming required 
It’s better to use a for loop in this case. Don’t use functions with side effects (like os.rename) in list comprehensions, it makes it harder to see what’s going on.
I use gnote as somewhat of an exo-cortex (I believe it's a bit like one note/tomboy notes). Maybe my suite of knowledge is smaller than yours but it serves me well. I usually note down anything I had to spend a decent amount of time discovering/researching/coding. It's hyper-linkable, but it's got past the point (note density) where adding new notes now takes too long. I've written alternatives myself, but never managed to polish them enough to want to use them all the time/trust my exo-brain with them! There's no version control as such but it does support making certain notes read-only.
Each virtualenv is a separate container. Each one starts empty without any libraries (other than pip, setuptools, and like 1-2 others). Once you activate a container you can start adding libraries to it. Doing so has no effect on the main Python install, as all of those libraries will be ignored.
give it a spin in let's say virtualbox before committing. A 10G partition for a run of the mill ubuntu is plenty. Personally I think that python on linux is a superior experience hands down. 
That's far more a "need to learn how to do better testing conditions" thing rather than list comprehension gone wrong.
&gt;To be honest I haven’t gotten into the online repositories like Github. The big problem here is that online access isn’t always available. Even at work you can’t always access the internet on the plant floor. (Terrible WiFi or too much concrete).

Since I only work on the local copy, online access is only necessary from time to time. By version managing the cheats, I also get a time log for free and it's easy to synch them only various machine.
Working on new version of art package (ascii art library for python) [https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art) &amp;#x200B;
&gt; If we want to micro-optimize here, they're also wasting time by constructing a list that is then just thrown away. If you want to optimize but still use an expression, have `def exhaust(gen): deque(gen, 0)` somewhere in your codebase and then just run exhaust on a generator comprehension. There are cases where a comprehension is more readable/nicer than a for loop (this one included). 0-length deques exhaust the generator and the overhead of creating and destroying an empty one is negligible.

Thanks a lot. I am using ES similarly. But without the sentiment extraction part. Currently it's only collecting data from 6 different API endpoints, doing some transformation and storing it in ES. 
Does the `--upgrade` flag override the version specification for some reason? You know, for those times where you go out of your way to specify a version but don't really mean it?
Based on your question, I think you would benefit from a general purpose, hands-on Python tutorial. [This is a great one](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) that seems like it would appeal to you.
Now that I re-read your post, I see that you use it for its stated purpose, and use other tools for other cases. nvm. 
To keep using the system installs, you can use the `--system-site-packages` flag when you create the virtualenv.

Not just harder to see, harder to modify as well, since comprehensions can only handle so much logic before you have to put stuff into a weird tailor-made function, e.g. for try/excepts. This goes double for os module functions - code with any filesystem calls without error handling WILL almost certainly fail sooner or later unless your code is confined to a single, unmodifiable environment. Of course, that's not the only option. Context managers? New function needed. Threading? Function. Locks? Function. You could of course refactor it when you want to add the stuff, but you might as well stop trying to show off your mad comprehension skillz and just write a plain ol' for loop.
Congratulations. You should consider updating this post and the project's homepage to say what it does.
Of course. OP didn’t read the docs obviously.

It doesn't matter whether it assigns the list to a variable or not, it still generates a useless list of `None`s that has to be built, then immediately garbage collected.
Exactly. I went to the homepage expecting to know what sanic but couldn't find any info. Had to resort to the project's github page
This is a long standing complaint. There was an issue complaining that this breaks requirements files and it was basically nofixed. 
But 18.1 is the newest release, 10.0.1 would not upgrade it.
*throws garbage in combine's face*
Pip is broken as a UI. If you use a requirements file without `--no-deps` it will install things from setup.py, which means it’s not a lock file. I see this mistake made frequently. 
What's funny is that I was thinking about how to make a Half-Life reference, but ended up dropping it because I couldn't make anything work. But you felt my dragon energy, regardless.
Yeehaw!
thank u
For sure. I was more considering that the code readability is reduced by needlessly assigning to a variable. 
&gt; You are correct. Apparently parasol is only updated for python 2.7. Actually, no, /u/netgu is the complete opposite of correct. He said "either you \[sic\] import statement is wrong or you don't have the files in the right place" but your import statement was correct and the files were in the right place. The problem was a version mismatch. Since your question clearly showed both the import statement you used, and the directory showing that the files were in the right place, I can only guess that he didn't even bother to read your entire post before giving a knee-jerk "ur doin it rong" response.
I gave him the benefit of the doubt since this was something I should have checked first. But yeah he could have been a little nicer about it :P
He had the modules in the correct location of an incorrect version of python, making it the incorrect location.
What about when Gordon makes the portal jump and sees aliens the first time then comes back and the labs blowing up? Maybe I’m mission something here tho...

fuck yeah, perfect timing. I was trying to switch to vibora because of some sanic shortcomings, turns out vibora isn't ready yet so I switched back to sanic but was still unsatisfied. After this update, took one look at the code and jesus they cleaned it up real good, there were some `todo` comments before that are all gone now.... this is starting to look really polished and proper, I'm really excited to resume working with sanic now
It would help to see line numbers in your errors 
It just says line 1, do you mean something else?
How are you running it? What does the folder structure look like, is there a file or folder called "book" or "book.py"?
wooooooooooooooohohohohoho!! I was getting 8k req/s before, now 9k! what did you guys do? :D
Can you elaborate on this? Why would you use `--no-dependencies`? Do you specify and pin absolutely all packages in your requirements.txt?
Wow, amazing work man ! Good job 
So the only third party library is python-box so I could use dot notation on dictionaries to speed up writing this. I spent a few weeks on this, and it is by far the largest project I've worked on, by several orders of magnitude. I've mostly made a few simple scripts and things like that, and usually completed these within an hour or a few hours. This was a several week long project. I started with the 'database' being JSON, and then ported it to SQLite3. I did a round of refactoring when I had it working as desired, and this involved breaking huge ugly functions into several functions. This is honestly the first time I've worked with SQLite3 on a real project, so I'm not totally sure I did this properly the way I would call information with queries, and then work with it right in the function. After the initial refactor, I tried to keep my code a bit cleaner as I continued working on this, but maybe it could use another refactor. I added in a bunch of fake users, and fake posts(using PRAW to scrape this subreddit for fake posts to add to the timeline). I used a few `while True` loops to sit at specific pages in the interface, and wasn't sure if this was the best practice. Obviously I had to make do with what I could given this was not a web-based project. And feedback would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks! It may not be perfect, and may even be a little rough around the edges, but I'm proud of it. It was very rewarding actually sticking with something like this for long enough to get it completed, or completed enough to share.
There are likely to be parts in further learning you think oh ye I could add to this project, and then you could do so with later projects and it could become like a web, until you’ve refined them all to near perfection 
Yeah, I think I may port this to a web-based program once I get familiar with Django or Flask. I haven't used either of these yet, but will definitely make a point to become familiar in 2019.
Yes, I have heard they are in high demand so it’s definitely a nice thing to have under your belt
Really happy to see this update, I'm using Sanic for two WIP projects. I reran a `wrk` where I was getting 8k req/s before, and now I'm getting 9k req/s after the update. Looks like the code has been completely cleaned up as well, it looks really proper/professional now. Thank you all for putting the work into this, really a great way to start the year.
I have the file itself saved in the documents section of my Mac, then I open terminal, type cd documents (to open documents) then type python game.py, that’s when it gives me this issue
Example image of timeline: https://i.imgur.com/RPRWsT8.png
Perfect! Thanks for the quick and thorough reply!
Well it's calling on a module somewhere that uses "book". Ehh I'm sure it'll work out. Just remember to believe on yourself! I do! 
Use python3 instead of python, pip3 instead of pip
It never was a lock file. It was only ever meant to save Python developers from carpal tunnel. Use a constraints file if you want to limit package versions. Or, use pipenv.
AFAIK requirements.txt is supposed to be used for complete and reproducible environment dumps while setup.py requirements are more like proper dependencies.
same error
This is almost exactly the sort of thing I would like, for when you want to group some objects in something like a module but without having to split it into a separate file. One important feature is for the namespace to appear before locals: a = 1 namespace NS: a = 2 def demo(): print(a) Calling `NS.demo()` should print 2. 
You don't type the python --version in the python shell, you type it in your regular terminal. Typing python3 in terminal will open python 3. Typing just python will open python 2
In your terminal?
ok nvm thank you
thank you
Try using atom IDE with hydrogen ([https://nteract.io/atom](https://nteract.io/atom))

So use pipenv?
--upgrade override all?
[Or not](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1219). I’ve lately become a huge fan of poetry’s “do *exactly* what I tell you” approach.
That assumes this is OC made recently
Hmm the piece that interests me is a CLI social platform. Kind of cool.
I recommend skipping actually getting the certification since no company cares about it. Try and land an internship at a local company. Even if they don't do internships just cold email them and ask if they would be willing to take an intern on. You will probably have to be content with minimum or near minimum wage for your first internship but it will be a really good setup for future years due to the fact that having an internship in high-school is rare. Also, be willing to learn another language for whatever you do. Local companies have a high likelihood of using something other than python in their dev process. Good luck my guy, this is how I got started too.
Are you referring to the screenshot I posted? That screen is from this project, feel free to download and check it out :) you will need python-box installed to run it, but it's a great module to have
Working on creating an Auto dm bot for my business but the get_direct_message() method doesn’t work for some reason. Has anyone encountered this problem.
While versions can be pinned in requirements.txt it really doesn't serve as a lock file. There are libraries such as pipenv that wrap pip and create proper lockfiles.
I'm lost, what happened and why is it "cowboy coding"?
Flask is an amazingly productive web framework. It's a a wonderful privilege to have tools like sanic and quart which bring the flask API forward. Sanic: like flask with asyncio, for anyone.
Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) Replit: [https://repl.it/repls](https://repl.it/repls)
The problem is that python's package manager was created before the idea of having reproducible environments vs. lockfiles existed. As a result neither setup.py nor requirements.txt really does reproducibility.
HTML and Git aren’t scripting languages
No, it literally uninstalls 18.1 and installs 10.0.1
Pipenv just isn't ready for mass use. Poetry isn't either, but it's still better than pipenv * pipenv builds on an unofficial standard by the PyPA. Poetry builds on an official standard by the PSF, a PEP. * pipenv is "meant" for libraries. But in python there is little to no difference between an app and a library. * pipenv breaks in a lot of terminal settings due to its use of click * pipenv is ridiculously slow in comparison to poetry * pipenv's author is an [egotistical narcissistic asshole who blames all his misbehavior and calling the community's constructive criticism against his tool as non-constructive and against him on his BPD, which is extremely offensive to those who have BPD and is also plain childish](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8kjv8x/a_letter_to_rpython_kenneth_reitzs_journal/?sort=top). 
Working on visualization techniques using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. It feels like matplotlib isn't really required as most of the visualization you might use in IRL can be done using pandas and seaborn but they are built on matplotlib so some exposure is required
What are you actually trying to achieve?
I'm launching a game launcher, and trying to detect if it's downloading an update by detecting the network usage by the program, and once it goes to 0mb/s to continue running
What's your next action going to be?
Press enter to launch the game
What game is that?
War Thunder
And the launcher is Steam then?
No, I got War Thunder from their website a long time ago &amp;#x200B;
Then if you're looking to automate things, it might be a good idea to just get the game on Steam. Steam has a built-in way to start Steam, wait for the updates to download, then start the game, all in a single command.
Where do I find that command?
Maybe it upgraded based on the version selection from another package? Mate, I really hate setuptools. Python packaging is a horrible mess. :(

Thanks for all your help - I won't be able to get back to this for a while but this is all marked down in my response history. 
Nice :D
Can you use docker? You could run Jupyter inside a container. 
Both advises are terrible. No, simply don't use `pip` when you can help it. `pipenv` is just a wrapper around `pip`, which is even worse than what it wraps. I actually found that for small projects (a dozen or so packages), it's actually better to not to use any Python packaging tools at all: just write a shell script that copies what you need to `site-packages` and live a happy life, go home confident that things won't suddenly break, no extra garbage will be installed and so on. It will also work blazingly fast compared to `pip` and friends.
Nowadays, I use docker for reproducible environments.
&gt; before the idea of having reproducible environments ... in the `pip` authors' heads. The idea itself is older than Python.
Give Kenneth a small break. He's done a *hell* of a lot of good for the python community in comparison to any mistakes he's made on communication.
Copy your game.py file to an empty directory and run it from there.
Made a pretty simple script that allows users to enter the url of a YouTube playlist and have the length of that playlist displayed for them. I don't know if that is even a necessary tool, but I couldn't find the total lengths of playlists on YouTube when I checked. 
But `setuptools` had nothing to do with this one (not that they are perfect, but just this time they aren't the one's guilty).
I'm confused - why do call it flat out "web server" ? &gt; Sanic: like flask with asyncio, for anyone. So things like Celery for async tasks is no longer necessary ?
IMHO it's a disaster in more ways. I tend to need modules with C components. They just fail during compilation on missing headers if not all C dependencies are installed. Pip simply does not check for them. You also need to know enough C and what package the missing header comes from to solve the issue. The whole point of having package managers is not having to deal with dependency mess.
Surprisingly complex project. Use XBMC or whatever it's called these days.
Check out the documentation for anaconda. You can actually install in user space without needing the permission of an administrator.
So in general.... Your list comprehension are performing badly... Compared to using normal code. That's when you know you are abusing list comprehension. Great work friend... On following up..
18.1 is the newest version, not 10.0.1
Sorry to bust your bubble but if it's using YouTube your plan may be ruined by an ad! You might want to get the .Mp3 and use that instead! Still, awesome idea! 
Why not HTTP? This sounds like a decent fit for HTTP.
Is that space between the equals sign?
Agreed but it will fail earlier if it can't open browser in milliseconds.
IMO, no. The whole rock star idolizing shift focus from code to personality, and that damages the whole community by focusing on the wrong things. 
Calling an undefined method in a release build (eg: untested)
Could work, sure. Does it not seem a bit heavyweight for such relatively simple requirements? 
if it can be async use kafka to send the messages across, very efficient and high throughput guaranteed. 
It might be useful, because some packages install programs with them, which other packages may rely on for their own functionality, whereas you might have forgotten to install them in virtual environment. For example, say you wanted to use `pytest` in your virtual environment, but you forgot to install it, while you had one installed in your system. Then, once you run your tests, you have no clue what the tests will import (or more specifically, where will they import things from).
Nice work ! But if I may suggest something, instead of returning False when some condition aren't good, maybe you should raise Exception that you declare. So in the future you'll be able to handle more precisely the interactions. &amp;#x200B;

You're kinda late, bro https://graphene-python.org
If you download the whl file and unzip it you will notice that you actually downloaded 10.0.1 and not the exact version you requested. The reasoning is most likely pip9.0.3 was broken somehow and they decided to replace the binary with a newer version. Or possibly the maintainers we're doing something funky and messed up when uploading to pypi. I think the former explanation is more plausible.
What was the version before that ? Maybe you can't downgrade for some reasons.

Is it really more heavyweight than inventing and maintaining a custom network protocol? 
What is heavyweight about HTTP? It won't get any simpler than that, the client and server library support is outstanding, and most of what you need is already there. Standardized and ready to use. Accept requests as multipart/form-data. Send responses either as zip or tar with all files involved, or keep the files as separate downloads with temporary names and include the links in the response. Up and downloading large files via HTTP is as fast as it gets. There is very little overhead involved.
You want maintain a Kafka cluster and put 100MB files into a persisted queue to implement a client/server request/response pattern? What!?
&gt; once it goes to 0mb/s to continue running It's going to go to 0mb/s more than once during the download.
Ahah nice project !

Sure, that would work great. Our school used a cloud based system from another company that required student logins, so I like that system for learning. 
This is awesome work, more so the point u/officalgel is making. A CLI interface would really be good, so instead of waiting for user input you just specify the program name and the argument e.g: ./main.py --timeline show ./main.py --friend add ./main.py --friend show &amp;#x200B; its really cool and gives you an awesome introduction into understanding how CLIs work. argparser is the library to use and is standard, i think.

Nothing. Everything I'm developing and/or maintaining is already Python 3 compatible.
pip too thanks
Install Jupyter to a remote server? There are some websites that offer free plans for such a thing or maybe your company will pay for a subscription.
Just pip install it and run at locally
One that has regularly caused me issues is lack of any cross dependency inspection. Last install always wins, you'd assume specifying a version in requirements.txt would do just that but really it just expands to multiple installs. So say your project depends on requests version X, so you pin it. Fruther down your list of dependencies you add 3p lib that depends on requests &gt; X+1 it's just going to go ahead and install that without warning or error. Maybe some day packaging will be fixed, but I doubt it.

Dude as a streamer, that is fucking glorious!!! good work man!!!
That behavior would be inconsistent with Python's handling of scope and globals. In a method definition of a class, class variables aren't automatically in scope like globals are. They have to be referenced explicitly.

python has so many cool libraries that I legit don't know if this is a reference to a useful library or a joke about how you can import modules to do anything.
Awesome, thanks for the extra resources. I had only real thought about us working through one example per concept, but I'll look into having a couple different examples for each one. Thanks!
Yeah multiple examples where they get the chance to try them by themselves for a few minutes is best. Practice practice practice. 
Just one lesson, unfortunately. I'm hoping that if it goes well, they'd be willing to extend it. Most people here seem to agree this is too much material for just this lesson, so I'm gonna try to pare it down. Thanks!

automate the boring stuff with python if you are a beginer
They broke their internal API and didn't test it before releasing it to the public *on a Friday* and broke hundreds if not thousands of people's deployment methods.
Yes currently reading this book, but it does not contain GUI part.
its not like python2 is going to delete itself. The scripts written in 2 are going to stay in 2 for the most part. You will still encounter it in the wild. Its just like running into old perl or lisp scripts its not a big deal. 
Databricks might be overkill for you if all you want is a notebook. But if you also want Spark and tons of RAM, and you want someone else to set it all up for you, Databricks is a good option.
I dont understand why not everyone switched already. There are not that many things to fix, there are libraries helping you and, i know there are huge codebases out there, but still... Python 3.0 final was released on December 3rd, 2008. Noone can tell me it takes 10 years to migrate. It just laziness, because "python2 works", but stagnation is a step backwards.
Autodesk (Maya, Max, Motion Builder, FBX) still ships custom 2.7 flavours with all of their products. For FBX they lock in a 2.7 and 3.1 dll plugin (which works with python up to 3.3) -- but have never supported anything later. According to this - https://www.vfxplatform.com/ -- they should have preview versions introduced this year (for their 2020 branded products I guess). Depending on how stable the product versions are and the studio size -- it is not always an immediate upgrade to the latest. I'd expect a few more years for this industry to transition fully. 
Personally if your interest is building GUI stuff I would look at some other language and anyhow would worry about it muuuuch later.

Well, you don't really need to worry about GUI stuff exactly... You can defer this to other frameworks. Pyqt is one option. I much prefer just using web interfaces, which means good old HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. UI can be totally separated from your application code. The python can just be your backend. 
Maybe I assuming too much here but my answer is based on the fact Op is just starting out, I could of course be wrong. Not mentioning various approaches to this is well laziness as I’m on mobile ;-) 
What do you mean? &gt; `any` on a generation comprehension?
care to share your grimoire ?
Not for pip-style package managers, which pretty much all of the things that have a sane lockfile used a lot of the ideas from pip (and avoided pip's mistakes.)

You can still use Celery process, I think it depends upon what you are trying to do and how heavy your background processes would be compared to your incoming traffic. &amp;#x200B; Async frameworks are not going to make your code run faster, just more efficiently by allowing the process to bounce back and forth between working on requests while one is waiting (as opposed to blocking all incoming requests). &amp;#x200B; Sanic has a built in web server and can be run as a standalone application (without \*needing\* gunicorn or something like it, although you can use gunicorn if you want).

I talk about: * statistics for the show, including download counts, etc. * how many episodes are about testing, how many about non-testing topics. * Python vs language agnostic topics * solo vs guest episodes * the top 5 episodes * stuff like that And then a retrospective like: * what went well * what was lacking * what's next I'd like feedback on what you think went well, was lacking, and where to take the podcast.
I have a project to write a blog on Python and data analysis in general. Nothing very original, but I'm spending lots of time on some topics because I'd like to write some in-depth posts. Right now I'm working on comparing multiple different techniques to read and write files to/from pandas data frames for speed and efficiency. I get to learn from that and if that can help a single other person then that's a win too.
Yes you are right I am starting in python.
Will surely look into it.
If you want to build gui "stuff", i recommend Visual C#, but only if you have a windows system
Everything. My job ain't switching. At all. -.-
Use getpass for passwords (instead of input). Very nice job! 
Im all for python 3, ut the first releases were horrible, and had many bugs. The first production ready python was 3.3. Still there has been time for updates and if someone is still on legacy python its their own fault.
Maybe it should have been built into it.

Why I am getting downvoted on this comment.. what am I missing🤔🤔
My condolences. 
no
I just finished a small tutorial for openpyxl on YouTube. If you are interested, here you can find it. https://youtu.be/NCkF8ed_wAA
All the projects and their source code (excluding the last one) can be found here: [https://cmlsc.itch.io/](https://cmlsc.itch.io/) The last project is a work in progress and it should be done sometime during Q1 2019. Happy new year! \\o/
Damn its beautiful, im learning to make games myself. Founf your work quite inspirational. 
I'm considering using Sagemaker and am curious to see if you've noted any drawbacks? Don't want to be caught off-guard...
Thanks! Gamedev is a lot of fun!
In serverless training, it is difficult to monitor the training metrics. Although the notebook instances are perfectly fine.
first what do you mean by "show the content of a full row" ? if that rows has content in 10 cells --- how exactly do you want the info shown to you/user ? I'm going to get DV'ed: but if you want to do that on a computer *interactively* the right answer is VBA.
think python is good for beginner, fluent python for intermediate. ive enjoyed both. 
I think that the media previews for posts would be a nice addition. I don't see a downside to it. Although I'm obviously biased as that would benefit me a lot.
What did you use to make these ? 
What are pip-stile package managers? `pip` never had a lock file... afaik the idea came from Ruby...
I used Python and Pygame for development and cx\_freeze/Pyinstaller for packaging.
nice interview 👌 
Jesus
Nothing, I dropped Py2.xx supposed on all my FOSS stuff this year, largely motivated by the type annotations.
Really, practice is key. Also, try using Counter instead of counter. 
I’ve never developed a game using python, but that definitely made me want to try. These look awesome, good job! 
Thanks 😊
I haven't started yet, but if you DM me some contact info, I can reach out on Discord or something and we can work in it. That goes for anyone. Might be a fun project for a few people to wok through 
These look really beautiful! Thanks for posting! Its inspiring 
You got some talent
Jesus, I wish I had the level of motivation that you appear to. 
That link is broken for me. Incredible work on these projects
 "".join([I for I in x if [j for j in I if j&gt;3]]) Is slower and less comprehensible to a newcomer (understanding of what a condition on a list does) than "".join([I for I in x if any(j for j in I if j&gt;3)]) This is because a list comprehension is at-time while a generator comprehension is lazy, as a generator is just a subset of an iterator. Thus a full list is never created, and `any` goes over each item in the iterator until it hits a `True`. Of course this assumes that `j`'s greater than operator doesn't have any side effects. But you shouldn't rely on side effects in generator comprehensions either way.
wow. I feel so dumb. thank you.
No. Doing good in the past does not excuse later misbehavior. I *am* giving him a break. You know why? Because I've always said, if he simply gets off his high horse and apologizes for that bullshit, I'll let bygones be bygones. But he's an egotistical narcissistic "Pythonista" of "Requests Fame". As he so commonly self advertises.
I wasn't very motivated until around Summer this year. I was working on average about 30 minutes a day for 4.5 years. I just made stuff whenever I felt like it. Now I'm really into game development, but I still don't really go past 3 hours a day. xD
Yeah, Pygame gets an undeserved bad reputation because of how easy it is to use. It leads to a lot of beginners using it. There are some games made with Pygame that look really good though. [Switchcars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/442210/Switchcars/) is a good example of this.
These look amazing. Did you make the graphics yourself?
Yes. I used a tool I made for all the animated artwork and MS Paint for the rest. :D
&gt; I actually found that for small projects (a dozen or so packages), it's actually better to not to use any Python packaging tools at all: just write a shell script that copies what you need to `site-packages` and live a happy life, go home confident that things won't suddenly break, no extra garbage will be installed and so on. It will also work blazingly fast compared to `pip` and friends. That has so many problems on a variety of environments and set ups I don't know where to begin. It's great that it works for you, but horrible practice.
You might have another python install (or venv python install) with a different pip version. Or you at one point updated pip in user mode when you couldn't in system mode, and system mode takes priority in the beginning but not the middle.
Do i need artistic skills like drawing to make these king of games or just coding
Troll on: Is not anything better than php? Troll off As for python, performance is bad unless you use packages with the underlying code write in C, C++, fortran, rust, cython, etc So image processing should be reasonably fast in python (because it is not in python)
Well hats off to you then! I just started getting into pixel art myself, although I'm using gimp instead of ms paint :P. I'll use your work as inspiration.
Personally I prefer MS Paint over Gimp for pixel art. The workflow is a lot quicker because of its simplicity.
The artwork is a major part of it, but you can definitely make these games with squares if you wanted. :P You could hire someone if you don't want to do the artwork yourself, but I'd recommend making it yourself. You learn and get better at it over time.
